5,Great book about a great woman.,"From all the books I've picked out of a bookshelf either on random or after having had them recomender to me, this is one of the best. This book was so inspiring. It outlined in a simple way the life and trials of blessed Mary MacKillop, and this Norwegian fell in love at once. If you want to learn more about this wonderful Aussie rolemodel, this is a great book to start with."
2,Don't Bother!,"I bought this CD at a stoop sale for one dollar, and then sold it at a stoop sale for a dollar or two. I am very glad that I did not pay full price (or even half price) for it. I did not think it was a bad CD, but a bland CD. Every track on it I have heard performed better elsewhere. They are like Muzak versions of great Latin works."
4,Meco 9350W Electric GFrill,I prviously had two Char Broil Electric Grills and both Failed 1/2 year of service.This one has worked well after 1/2 year.
1,Stop Drey from producing songs!,"This album is different from the first in that it's mostly slow jams with one guy singing lead(in a really breathy voice) all the time. The lack of variety makes it boring after a while. The other members of Kai seem to get lost in the backround. You can't really pick out any one else's voice.I have to say I liked the first album much better. The mix of songs, fast and slow, kept my interest. Also, the arrangements on the first on allowed us to hear more of the individual voices.I'm disappointed that the new album focuses on one singer, because everyone who has the first CD knows that the other guys have great voices, even better than the one overused voice on 'The Promise.'Go back and listen to the first CD...you'll hear the difference."
5,Absolutely Gorgeous Collection,"This is one of the best CD's I've ever purchased. Wonderful variety of music, beautiful Spanish songs and so many great old standards done only the way Vikki could do them. I strongly recommend it."
3,Pretty good book,I bought this to see if AODA was right for me as It is a sister organization to OBDD. This book is used as their introduction lessons. There is lots of good information in the book and it is designed to carry you through the first year of training. It gives you a list of other reading material that you should read along with meditations and rutual. If you are interested in AODA this will be your first year of lessons.
5,This product works,I have been suffering from IBS for over 10 years now. This product has reduced my symtoms 95 %. I can live a very normal life. My discomforts have gone. I initially took two capsules in night with water for one month and started taking 1 after that
3,"OK, but...",This was edited and compiled by Tomkins early in his career. It is not his work and the chapters are interesting mostly from a historical point or view.
2,Hyenas Laughed at Me for Buying this Book,"I'm a big fan of the Traveler's Tales Series, having read The Best Travelers' Tales, Spain, Greece, Australia, etc. After reading the VERY FUNNY ""Snake Charmer of Guanacaste"", a short story that is also in the Best Travelers' Tales, I was expecting more of the same humorous situations in travel. This book, however, sorely underdelivers. It is hard for me to recall a single other funny story in this book, with the possible exception of the Monster Dildo. Which isn't even as funny as it sounds. Now I'm not one for forced humor, but there are obviously funnier stories about traveling than those listed here (I know I have several of my own).The biggest disappointment, however, is this book's contrast with the vastly superior Best of and individual country books. I feel shortchanged and as if the hyenas are laughing at ME."
5,Best ska CD I have,"YOU MUST LISTEN TO IT, this is the best CD from one of the best ska bands. An important CD for every rude boys in the whole world."
3,Okay,"They are okay pair of scissors. They were very sharp when new, but after a while they started losing their shapeliness."
3,"Too much theory, not enough instructions","The book is 600 pages and only 40 of them involve RAC administration. The rest are mostly explanations of the theory and the workings of Oracle RAC. Most of the information in this book can be obtained either through the metalink or other websites.The book is good if you would like to expand your knowledge of RAC. But its lack of details on ""how to"" install, troubleshoot, configure, and manage RAC makes this book less than ideal for Oracle DBAs.Finally, although the author(s) are obviously good writers, their writing style is more suited for a novel. Their smooth but wordy and banal prose makes it exceedingly easy to miss important points regarding Oracle RAC."
1,content is just so-so,"This isn't a great book the facts are very misleading and inaccurate, for example the book implies having 99.999% uptime is unachievable. I have implemented many systems which have uptimes approaching 100%."
5,Good Reference Book,"It is a good reference book on database clusters. While covering Oracle Real Application Cluster in detail, it puts the failover clusters in perspective. Authors have good understanding of the product. Backup/Recovery, Tuning and Cache fusion is well covered.This book discusses installation details for various platforms and makes suitable references to metalink notes and other books. Topics like split brain, quorum drive are explained well. Coverage on IBM-AIX, Linux and Polyserve is pretty good. It is a well researched book.Some screen shots are not very clear, book production quality needs imporovement, neverthless it is an excellent technical book.I strongly recommed this book for the DBAs interested in understanding and implemnting Oracle RAC Solution."
5,perfect,product shipped before date and arrived perfect. install was easy and the product works great. I recommend both this product and company.
2,A waste of money,"If you want to waste your money, read all those 5-star reviews and buy the book (as I did). If you want to learn how to write comedy, buyThe Comic Toolbox: How to Be Funny Even If You're NotandThe New Comedy Writing Step by Step. They are the best. ""What Are You Laughing At?"" is not about comedy writing at all. It's mostly boring fluff about writing in general. Since the book is not about comedy writing, it can't teach you the craft. Why to bother?"
5,Over 70 excerpts from top screenwriters,"Produce winning comedic screenplays using fiction and nonfiction alike with Brad Schreiber's What Are You Laughing At?: How To Write Funny Screenplays, Stories, & More. Included are over 70 excerpts from top screenwriters and pairing them with writing exercises and details on the differences between writing comedy for TV versus stage. There are eleven modes of comedic dialogue, 13 common problems screenwriters encounter and valuable insights into the rhythm and sound of words in What Are You Laughing At? Brad is himself a L.A. screenwriter, so his tips come from an insider's hand."
2,Plastic is Not Durable Enough for Six Year Olds,"For the first few weeks these scissors were comfortable and cut accurately. Until last week I would have rated them a 4 or 5. Then my kids got ahold of them. They tried to cut through some thick puffy stickers. Granted, an adult probably wouldn't have tried this, but they did reveal a design flaw. The blades are attached with a metal screw screwed into plastic. When enough force is applied (say, by a six year old), the plastic breaks. I repaired them with Gorilla glue and they were OK for a few days until I tried to cut some flower stems for Mother's Day. That was too much for them."
1,Review on Left handed scissors- Very disappointed,It did not work for my 11 year old son. It was the same as right handed scissors. He could not see where he was cutting and became very frustrated. Glad it worked for others. Not for us.
4,Enjoyable Read,I enjoyed the story. It was a liitle bit different. You never know where love will rear its beautiful head and confuse the story line.
4,Too have and never not,Oooo Wee now this Dereon boot to have and never not is the boot. Grab a pair of Dereon skinny jeans and say no more. Don't forget your dereon puffer.
1,Almost never played with.,"I guess these work ok but they do not stay on your ear very well at all which is very frustrating to a kid. My kids played with them very little because of this, would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Nice collection of songs.,"Night Ranger is a good band that's released some listenable material. I've never considered myself to be much of a fan, but I still bought this collection of hits. They play a nice blend of pop rock. They do a cool job of using guitars alongside keyboards also. They do well in the backing vocal department too. The songs that I like the most are ""Sing Me Away,"" ""When You Close Your Eyes,"" and ""Don't Tell Me You Love Me."" Those three tunes are very melodic, energetic, and have really good choruses. Night Ranger has good songwriting skills and musicianship. There are some nice guitar licks and solos on here. The rest of the material on this album is not bad either. Worth a listen."
5,Great Value,Load Software. Plug in. Scan. Output very good. It doesn't get much easier. Great value for the dollar!
4,"Big bang, little bucks","I bought this in May when we upgraded our computer and have been very pleased. The quality of the scans for both text and pictures is quite good and the software makes working with the scanned images very easy. You do sacrifice some speed at this price and a few little quirks (have to jump in and out of some programs to use others) with some of the software may cost you some time, but the other features and the quality of the scans more than make up for those factors. I haven't tried the negative scan yet but will be working on trying that in the near future. You could do a lot worse for your money- this one is a keeper."
1,Don't buy this scanner!,Don't buy this scanner if you are going to use it to scan b&w pages of text from text books. This scanner does an extremely poor job of a very basic function. The quality of the scans are terrible and the time required to get a preview of the scan on the screen is almost a minute! If you are trying to hold a text book open and flat against the bed that is way too long. This scanner doesn't compare with an old HP scanner that only scanned at 300 dpi!
3,OKAY!,Came in nice box and got what was described! Color is nice...good product for amounrt of money. is a present for my 7 year old nephew.
1,Didn't last long,Bought the Timex Kid's T71962 about a month ago. It already locked up and doesn't work. I would not recommend it
2,"Same as ""Not Durable""","a agree with the Not Durable reader exactly. My 6 year old liked this watch, but the buttons froze and the elastic part got too stretched and it broke within a few months."
2,"For a kids watch, watch out","This watch looked old about 3 days after we purchased it for my 9 year old son. The face scratched easily, but more weirdly, the watchband started to unravel and I needed to sew it back down. The elastic that attaches the watch face to the band has gotten all stretched out and just about 2 months later, we need a new watchband. I am disappointed in this watch. I would've expected something called ""Kids"" and ""Ironman"" to be durable, but this is about as cheap as they come."
4,Very Handy For College Work!,"I had bought my laptop used from ebay, and the performance on this machine is very good. I had mine upgraded to 512mb of ram, including a combo dvd/cd burner, which really made this thing pretty powerful. I also bought a wireless card with this laptop which made getting on the internet a breeze. I used this laptop for all of my college needs, and I highly recommend it those who want to get a good laptop at a low price. The only thing that bothered me about this computer is the small 6gb hard drive, but you can always buy a bigger hard drive or just get an external one. Overall, this laptop is the alternative, affordable choice for basic computing and internet needs."
1,Pillow Quality,"I bought a set of pillows, thinking I was buying high quality. But actually the pillows are not as advertised. I contacted the company about this, they stated that I should have read the ad first before buying. To me, this ad...Queen Classic White Goose Down Feather Pillow, Set of two pillows, 51 oz each, sounded like ""Goose Down"" meaning not having a sack full of hard and sharp DUCK feathers. Their return policy states return the ""UNOPENED"" package for refund or exchange; used pillows cannot be returned due to sanitary reasons. My first thought was WOW, how are we supposed to know what these pillows are like if we cannot open them. Before I even tried using the pillows, I noticed 5% down and 95% duck feathers on the ""Official Material"" tag. Since I cannot return the Pillows or exchange them, I would like the ad to be changed to reflect what the pillows are actually made of. 5% down in my opinion does not constitute a ""White Goose Down Feather Pillow"", but a standard feather pillow."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This was a special offer and the price seemed excellent. Description stated ""Standard Classic White Goose Down Feather Pillow"". A more accurate description would have been ""Mostly Feather Pillow with Some Goose Down, Skimpily Filled"". I would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate; i.e. larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order. Vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content, as they did with other catalog items. I believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was. Caveat emptor!"
1,Chopped Up Goose,"It feels like they chopped up a goose and put it in this pillow. A few of its feathers are still on there, but they stick through! It is rough and pokey, even through a very nice pillowcase. Save your money and purchase a pillow that you would actually want to lay your head on. This is one of the worst pillows I have ever used."
1,Horrible. Gross.,"These pillows should not be sold. The subject line is misleading first of all. I think the only white down in them is stuff that accidentally floated in Forrest Gump style. The feathers are so large that I have had them POKE through the pillow and leave a hole. The smell horrible, and I woke up with a raging sore throat that developed into a sinus infection. Just plan gross. I would give them zero stars if I could. I am returning them obviously."
1,STINKY POKE-YOUR-EYE-OUT PILLOWS!,"Got to return these miserable things as they cannot be used as bed pillows. These are actually feather pillows with a tiny bit of swept up down thrown in......and the feathers have not been thoroughly washed (evidenced by the smell). Bad, bad, bad!"
5,A Great Expose on the Fastest Growing Crime in America!,"How many times have you disposed of items containing personal information (e.g., credit card statements, Electric Bills, etc.) without destroying them first or utilized a personal computer in a public place (e.g., Airport, Train Station, etc.)? After reading Identity Theft you may think twice. John Vacca presents an informative text that enlightens the reader on current methods employed by identity predators and how to protect yourself and your business. Mr. Vacca also addresses the Internet environment and the increasing use of E-Commerce, and exposes the dangers that exist both from the user and developer perspectives. For the IT professional, Identity Theft offers many informative essays on the use of Digital Signatures, Smart Cards, Optical Cards and Encryption as protection methods. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"
4,Not bad,"Very different from previous MGS games since you can control your team now. Overall, it's kind of fund."
4,My son is VERY pleased.,"I ordered this game for my son and he is very pleased with it.This was also our first time ordering through amazon.com and buying a used item,it was an easy and fast order and well worth it."
4,SOLID PORTABLE,"Takes some time to get used to the controls, but once you do......IT'S METAL GEAR AND IT'S PORTABLE ""THATS AWESOME!"""
4,A good intro to the Culture series,"It certainly is the first of the series, and you can tell both at the style and story. It is worth reading, especially if you have read other books on the culture or you are planing to."
2,Couldn't Finish,"This book was purchased based on the good reviews - silly me; need to learn to look at negative reviews also. I found the book to be boring at best. Love SciFi, particularly space wars, so maybe I was just looking in the wrong direction for a new and stimulating author. This was my first book by Banks; it will be my last."
1,Too many Torture Scenes,"I was excited about getting this book. But the first Chapter is a detailed description of someone being tortured and killed by being drowned in human feces and urine. It gets worse from there. The plot seems to be linked together by repeated torture, alien ritual killings, etc. If I wanted needless violence, I'd watch a movie instead of reading. What will I do with this book now? I can't finish it and wouldn't even give it to someone I hated. Disappointing. The book is just too repulsive to be enjoyed."
2,Bleh,"A quote from another reviewer sums up what I thought of this book quite well: ""It is probable that this moral ambiguity -- in the portrayal of both Horza and the background war -- is the intent of the author, and is supposed to make the novel sophisticated and thought-provoking. But without a strong moral component to drive the tension, I was simply left wondering, as I read the final passages, why I should care about anything I had just read.""I quit caring much about 50% through...by 75% I was mostly skimming, and the final sequences held zero suspense for me. When it ended, I felt like I'd wasted a bunch of time, plus a bit of money.Before starting this series I saw that other books in it had higher average ratings, but figured I wanted to read from the beginning. Do the books really get substantially better? Because I really didn't care for this one..."
4,1st,"It's one of those rare cases when the sequels are significantly better than the original book. The book is interesting anyway and explains a lot about Culture history and sociology, also has quite strong action, recommended #scifi #ebook (Also read in Russian and finally my next book is in English and for Kindle: Zero History by William Gibson)"
3,I felt let down at the end,"No plot spoilers here, but I felt kind of dumb for staying with the story all the way to the end. Pointless character development. Maybe if I double down and read the rest of the Culture series, it'll all come together? (Nah - too long of odds for my taste.)"
5,BACK IN PRINT,"Consider Phlebas is back in print. Look for it. ORBIT Press has republished it. This is my favorite of Iain Banks books: dramatic, intense, and funny."
1,I must have read a different book...,"_Consider Phlebas_ is one of the few books I have thrown against the wall upon finishing. The ending is sort of a grand ""f*** you"" to the reader and characters.While Banks has a lot of nifty and neat ideas, there are lots of dumb people doing dumb things throughout the novel. (E.g. ""I know you're not really the captain, but rather an eerie doppelganger, but that's ok with me."") The motivation of some of the main characters is confusing and/or absent. It was frustrating because while some aspects of the Culture were neato (i.e. interesting but ultimately unrealistic) I could never connect with the characters.I was very disappointed in this book. (Sorry.)"
2,Disappointment,"All I can think is that a lot of the people rating this 5 stars must not read much sci-fi. The action in the story wasn't bad and I liked a few things about it, such as the Damage game. However, the wording itself was only average, and the end was not only predictable but way too drawn out. Sometimes drawing out a scene can add to the suspense but in this case it just seemed like wasted words. I was looking forward to reading a new author and I liked the title and people seemed to like Banks a lot, but now I can't see why. I wouldn't call the book outright bad but it fell well below my expectations."
3,Disappointed,"Considering the amount of praised heaped on this book and the Culture series from friends and the reviews here, I came away from this book disappointed. The most interesting parts: the great war, the Culture society, the AI Minds, were all held in the background while the protagonist and his random adventures were put up front. Which was fine and entertaining for an SF action novel, but nothing original and somewhat frustrating knowing that those interesting elements were ignored. There are many cool parts though, such as the Oribitals and the giant Culture ships, but focusing on a cult on an island and a laser fight in a temple was too mundane for my tastes. Perhaps other books in the series will more epic and less random action, but this one was a disappointment."
3,Not bad,"This is gritty, hard-boiled science fiction. Not the happier, fluffier sci-fi/fantasy I tend to prefer. It was dense with imagery and not for the faint of heart. It chronicles a more realistic view of warfare, where there may not be any truly `good guys' and there are things even moderately good people have to do to survive that are not pleasant. And not everything turns out for the best.The story was a little slow moving at times, and there was far more description than I liked, but the plot was strong. The action sequences were compelling, and the characters, while not precisely likable, were intriguing. It was a slog at times getting through it, yet at others, the pages flew.I'd say that a hard-core sci-fi fan would probably enjoy it."
3,"3.5 actually. Well worth reading, but ...","I first read Consider Phelbas about 8 years ago, and I just reread it for the 2nd time.CP is Bank's first ""Culture"" science fiction novel. It's basically old-fashioned space opera written in a more literary style. The writing style is at times wonderful-even poetic-but I found it too dense most of the time. Banks, like Tim Powers, is at times pretty hard to read vs. say someone like Dean Koontz or Stephen King. This has kept Banks from achieving greater popularity (I think).The ending of the novel, though, is poignant and does make up for some of the excesses of the novel. However, the protagonist, who dies at the end, is ultimately a fool-he gets himself and a lot of other good people killed for some dumb abstract ideology(analogous to joining the Nazi Party to fight Communism)."
3,could have been better,the premise was impressive but the story seemed too disjointed and wasn`t very compelling. i had little emotional reaction to the main character. i finished the book reluctantly.
3,Not the best of his sci-fi work!,"The culture novels are without a doubt the best new sci-fi series around at the moment, However, although this novel is, chronologically speaking, the first of the set it is cosiderably less accessible to a new reader than the others. If you are a newcomer to Banks's science fiction don't start with this one, Try ""player of games"" or ""use of weapons"" first. Either of these are a much better introduction to the Culture universe and, like me, if you try this title first it may take several insistent friends to convince you to come back (which luckily I have). Otherwise, although difficult to get into, it is a fine book. (one minor niggle however, considering this and the two titles I mentioned earlier, hasn't Iain ever considered a somewhat less than tragic ending for his main characters? I don't think any of them could really be described as having ""won"" by the end of the story, perhaps his later titles are different, I will have to read them to find out.)"
4,More beautiful music than we'd any right to expect.,"The Transylvanian composer Bretan had one of the grimmer lives of any notable composer - his wife's family were murdered in Auschwitz; his refusal in post-war Romania to become a Communist led to his silencing - but you wouldn't know it from either of these operas.They are serious and solemn enough. 'Golem' takes the old story of a rampaging Frankenstein-type monster and turns it into a melancholy dialogue about life, science, creation, family. 'Arald', with its hero supplicating the Seer of the Underworld to resuscitate his dead love, forswears doomy Gothic in favour of more metaphysical musings.From a dramatic point of view, both works are static. Musically, however, they are gloriously reminiscent of mid-period Verdi - bountifully melodic, rapturously sad - with an Eastern European flavour. The fact that an opera composer in the mid-20th century dared even write a TUNE is reason enough to rejoice."
2,Collection of vignettes,"From a storytelling standpoint, this is a slow one. While I found the SF aspect somewhat interesting, it was challenging to stay engaged in the story when each chapter presented a different viewpoint and the content of which may or may not relate to the story you THOUGHT was going on.Good strong work as long as you approach it as a collection of vignettes of loosely-related characters."
5,An excellent realistic exploration of space colonization,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I found it a refreshing and thoughtful exploration of what colonization of space would be like from the perspective of the colonists. Most sci-fi books I've read either have aliens hand over some near-magic technology or some genius give Earth the trick it needs to get to distant planets with minimal time or effort. This book explores what I believe is a much more likely scenario: that people have to actually work hard for generations to get to their destination. In this book we get to follow these generations of colonists, starting with the first brave souls who work together to get off Earth, and following their descendants as they struggle to reach and colonize a distant world. If you want escapist fantasy, you may be disappointed, but if you want to experience what real space colonists may someday go through, read this book!"
4,Air Gear Review!,"Let me just start out by saying I love Air Gear for its Witty,boobies,and just has great animation. My major bif with the series itself to me is even though it says complete series of 24 episodes at the end of the series your like this isn't the end because Ichi not even becoming a Sky King lol. It needed to be like 50 episodes instead of 24. Anyways loved it while it lasted and is a good buy for the money so yeah :) I give it a 4/5."
5,perty good,this is a very good show if your looking for a cool box set and all that order the other regular ones but if you want the show for cheap order this came in great condition and is an amazing show
2,waste of money,"This item looks great in theory, but it just isn't worth it. The pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out, some don't fit in, and some stick out too far, leaving you with a messy look to your lite art. One of the crayons for the neon was broken when received, but it didn't matter, since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway. If you do buy this item, be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that isn't even included."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY__PLEASE!,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! I was so very disappointed with this product. The quality is poor. Stick with LITE BRITE!
3,Good workout video but DVD freezes and stops working.,I like the workout video. The problem is that after only a few times playing it's freezing and stops playing.
4,Jane Fonda inspires!,"When my favorite yoga instructor at my gym took time off after the birth of her first child, I knew I needed some form of exercise that I could do easily at home. So I ordered Jane Fonda's latest tape, Fit and Strong. I love it! If you have trouble exercising and need to be able to do so every day for 20 minutes, this is the exercise tape for you! There is a lot of focus on weights, which I love, and after doing it for two weeks, I have learned to pick up the pace when needed. It is a solid, good job at providing a nice little home workout and it focuses on those pesky little parts that are hard to address when you are older: your upper arms, your thighs, your butt, and your lower abdomen. I'm 66 and, like Jane, look and feel younger. It's the perfect DVD!"
2,Probably a good video for someone new to exercising,"I am 65, a frequent walker & periodic exerciser. I found this DVD very easy and very basic. The DVD has an emphasis on improving balance, which is important. Workout Level 1 had a lot of sitting exercises. Workout Level 2 had some good basic exercises & stretches; I found it very easy. I used 2 lb weights but, because there wasn't a lot of repetition, I will probably try 5 lb weights next time for at least some of the exercises. I was disappointed because I expected more ab exercises and something a little more fun. However, I did find it a good reminder to do exercises to improve balance."
2,Jane Fonda Prime Time- Fit & Strong,"This exercise video might be good for a lot of people. But I thought it was too slow. I liked her older exercise video, which is unavailable."
4,Get Up and Move,Good workout disc. Do it at your own pace and you will enjoy it. Great start to your morning routine..
1,Much too hard,I was hoping for an age appropriate work out with Jane Fonda but found it way beyond my capabilities even though I am an able 75 year old woman. But I quit after the first run through and was very disappointed with the video.
4,Jane has still got it.,"This workout video is really good for people who are either just starting out or people like myself who work out regularly. I have found that this is just enough to say you did a workout, she works the whole body. If you do both of the workouts it is pretty complete. It is safe to do also. I enjoy it."
4,Great Fan,"Overall fairly easy to install. The wires from the fan to the controls are short enough to make it a little bit of a challenge. Other than that it works great, moves air well."
3,very fun and sneaky,"the spy tracking system is very sneeky.i love it a lot but the problem is you have 2 turn on and off all of the sensors,i hide them all around my house and at my bed time i close my door and play but if one of the sensors go off that is near my room i run into my bed. ill promise u will love this toy."
1,dont buy this,iv gotn a lot of spy stuff but this i STUPID i mean that in the werst imaginable way. AND IT DOES NOT WORK THRU WALLS. this thing is junk
5,Say hi to the spy!,You can spy so much!!!!!!!!!!!it is so helpfull if you have a family than you should have this!!!!!!!! You will be suprized about your bday preset but not when someone barges i to your room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Awesome!,It doesnt really mean 75feet. it means you can place the sensors 75feet away from the station.It tracks about 20 feet and has 3 detectors.
2,not too good reviewer,if you want an easy reviewer buy this and suffer the consequence... if you want realistic exam go look for other.
1,Yaaawn....,"A total piece of crap,only useful for recycling.It is demented in it's ethics,based on bigotry,written by a true ignorant.Use your money on comics instead,they tends to be more intilligent than this joke."
1,Would that I had the worlds,"I am very interested in the truth. In searching for it I came across this book. If this author is an ""enlightened"" author, the Neo-Pagan movement is really in the dark and with reason.The author claims to have the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, the one and only truth and anyone who has the termerity to disagree is damned. Doesn't this sound like Jerry Falwell? I thought so too. I find this trend disturbing to say the least. Given the classic three wishes, I would have to include this book in the ""Get rid of all bad books"" wish."
1,Not the Best,"I am a taller girl trying to get a collection of low-heeled/flat shoes. I like the mint colour of these shoes, so I ordered a pair. When I opened the box, I noticed a small rip in the leather upper on the inside. This leather is of lower quality than Payless or Wal-Mart shoes. I have a narrower foot and they were not wide enough to be comfortable: The elastic across the top is excessively tight. Buy this shoe only if you have a very narrow foot because the length of the shoe fits true to size and you will not be able to go up a size without the shoe looking weird on your foot."
5,Transformational Change is the real message,"""Swing to Balance"" uses Golf as a backdrop, as well as a simulation tool, in this book which is a great quick read and a thought provoking tome for all managers. The reader follows the journey of Al, whom we all can relate to. Al's problems, search and discovery process in conjunction with Tom Wentz's direction in the story allow us all the ability to read a case study in a fictional organization's transformational change.Despite the fact that this is a fictional account, it is based on a real compan(ies) that have gone through the same process. Unlike many Management books, Wentz's book follows a narrative akin to Goldratt's ""The Goal"". The time invested to read it will not be wasted. I highly recommend this book and using it as a primer for consideration of how one needs to look at the direction of their personnel and operations."
2,"Hey if you hate progress, go live in a van by the river, and eat government cheese.","The information value of this book is limited by the authors anti Western, anti US stance of practically EVERYTHING that has occured since the beginning of time. His whinning is tedious, and really gets in the way of any information thats there. I hope a better book comes out but I will never read another one by him again."
2,spoiler.,"I really liked this book, right up until near the end. Then we're told something horrible and unfixable has happened to the little girl, in such a way that it seems unquestionable. Well, it hasn't, but it ruined the book for me. The actual problem, which was fixable, was much less. It just left me with a horror of the book."
1,racist derogatory images,"I'm a African American and purchased this game and was shocked at the racist image of the black character called BT in this gameThe character was drawn with big bulging eyes, big pink lipsand drawn to resemble an ape like creature!I'm am outraged and highly frustrated with sony and anyone elseassociated with this game!maybe it's time for African Americans to stop buying Sony products!"
1,Not for the pure music lover,"Khachaturian's Violin Concerto is one of my favorite concertos but this rendition, in my estimation, is poorly executed by the technical recording people. Here the orchestra is the prominent feature and the violin, which should be prominent, is merely bckground accompaniment and is barely audible.Perhaps in a film scene, where the prime concentration of the audience is not on the music but on the play itself, it may be adequate as backround. But as a separate selection where the listener wants to enjoy the violin music, it is a failure and I would not recommend it to the pure music lover."
3,reads like a first draft rather than a complete book,"Dershowitz has some interesting ideas, but does not flesh them out as fully as he could (especially in the first third of the book, focusing on the religious origins of the Declaration). All too often, instead of taking a full quote from Jefferson or Adams and interpreting it, he borrows a few words from some other historian's characterization of what Jefferson thought. As a result, this book is likely to persuade only those who already agree with him; I sense that the publishers made him finish this book a bit too quickly.But Dershowitz's dissection of natural law in the second half of the book is a little more persuasive, because he relies on logic rather than on inadequate research."
2,Quick shipping...bad product,This product was aweful! It started out great and is really quiet as long as you keep the whole filter under water. But it clog's all the time! So I constantly have to unclog it!
2,product damaged,"The packaging of the damaged product and open content, not finding part of parts such as: large black rubber and installation tool, reason by which it is difficult to install the product, please I would like to be solved this problem that the payment was cancelled in its entirety, which is why you should be very careful with products they offer that their products are damaged and incomplete."
1,a wonderful romance novel-except it lacks romance,I bought this book in the romance section and there is no romance in it. The characters are written in such a stern fashion it is hard to relate to them. You don't understand how they fell in love nor do you care.
2,Not a favorite,"I did not enjoy this book and was happy I got it for $1 after being withdrawn from the library's collection (2 checkouts in 8 years.) I was ready to stop reading half way through as I did not like any characters. The only reason I continued to read, was a hope that the story would take a different direction with the two children. A lackluster ending, a lot of useless swearing covering for a lack of imaginatio and real vocabulary. I would probably give it 1 1/2 stars, but I'm feeling generous. Besides, I actually finished the book."
3,Decent Knife,"I'm a professional caterer, chef, food stylist, and blogger, and have used a lot of knives... but never a Wusthof. After hearing others clamor over the Wusthof name, I always kept the brand on the back burner, and finally decided to make the purchase after Amazon featured it as a daily deal item.Overall, I'm not particularly impressed. This knife does a fine job cutting through bread, tomatoes, and other foods, but it didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps my expectations were set too high by friends and coworkers who loved the brand?Personally, I like my knives to have weight to them, and this knife is fairly light. I also read multiple reviews here that said the knife's blade seemed to bend... in general, I'm skeptical of reviews by others because you never know how trustworthy the reviewer is, but I have to agree, the blade does bend slightly. The bending isn't enough to worry about for general purposes, but it does move when you're cutting really crusty bread."
4,"Exotic Items, Hardly!","I do not think items like nutritional yeast, kelp powder, or miso is exotic. I have three misos in my refrigerator right now and both nutritional yeast and kelp powder. Once you build a vegetarian kitchen, these items become staples.Eating vegetarian and a having healthy vegetarian diet requires some re-wiring of thoughts on food. If you are new to cooking healthy vegetarian foods, then I suppose, they might sound exotic. I live in a meat eating town (coneys and burgers are the staple) and I can find almost any of these ""exotic"" items in my local health food store."
1,I just can't get these recipes to go in 20 minutes,"I am not a regular cook. I do not study cooking. I do not regualarly seek out blogs, books, or TV shows about cooking. I have little experience in cooking. If these statements describe you, as they do me, I just cannot recommend this book. The ingredient lists are long, and often complicated, with no pictures of the finished product. My biggest complaint is with the wording--""20 minute to dinner"" and ""quick."" This just isn't the case for a novice, uninterested-in-cooking person. If it hadn't been billed as convenient, I would never have purchased this book."
2,Boring,My daughter played with this for 2 days. It is in her closet. It does not sit up. The buttons do not stick out inorder to catch a child's attention. Very boring. Not worth the money
3,basketcase in Ohio,My daughter almost 3 loves this toy. She has had it a year now and it is still on it's original batteries. I do think that they need to make Tad stay on better. I would also like to get more items for the cart....
5,The BEST Activity Book Ever!,"If you want to make creative, fun, and unique jewelry, than look no further! Paper Clip Jewelry is a kit with everything you need to make fun, fine, and fabulous stuff! There are gold, silver, and colored paper clips, wire pliers, beads, string, and more, including a how-to book. My parents were amazed that I could make jewelry out of such simple stuff. The book gives clear instructions and fun projects, but the most important thing is to be creative. I did that and the result was FABULOUS jewelry! So order this TERRIFIC book today and say hello to a new hobby!"
5,Good Things Come In Small Packages!,"I just finished ""Another Sad Love Song"", and it was a really good read.

4,Nice Read,I enjoyed this book very much. It is a nice romantic read and I found myself feeling as if I knew the individuals. Keep up the good work.
4,Thumps Up !!!,"I have a 2.5 yr old boy and he absolutley loves this car. He calls it the blue car. The car is very durable, and it even runs on carpeted floors. The only peeve I have is that, the music is a tad loud for my liking. Then again, I am not the one who is playing with it. I recently got him a Road Ripper Hummer made by the same company. He likes that too.Happy Parenting !!!!"
4,Overpriced,"How could you offer to sell this camera for $999.00 on December, 2008, when I bought this very same camera during the summer of 2005 for $299.00 from Beach Camera in New Jersey? I also bought the flash from Amazon for less than 60 dollars. Unless this camera has become a collector's item, I don't see any reason for its price to have tripled since 2005, given that there are newer models, and many Digital SLR's for lower prices."
3,Not what I thought,My mother bought this for my 3 year old and thought that it would stimulate his more creative side as well as teach him letters of the alphabet.This toy would be better for a child that is a little older. Pressing go to start games and color at the same time tends to be confusing and frustrating. Try and pay attention to someone talking while you are writing or doodling. Not easy!!
4,Great fun for your little one,"Let me start off by saying how much it annoys me when people complain that a toy hasn't lived up to its stated educational value because it hasn't taught their kid their ABC's and 123's. An educational toy is not meant to replace the parent as a teacher. My son rarely plays with his LeapPad, Imagination Desk or LeapFrog Reading Desk without me beside him. To me they are teaching tools that help me make learning fun for my son.With that being said, I think the Imagination Desk is a wonderful purchase. My son knows his alphabet, but this desk is improving his word recognition and teaching him to follow directions (press the green ""GO"" circle, color within the lines), something very difficult for a strong-willed 2 1/2 year old to do."
3,hasn't really lived up to it's durability ..,"My son(now 4)recieved this toy last year for Christmas. The plastic piece that clips on is not made for a younger child. He broke it off because he tried to take it off. Although, he has still tried to play with it regardless of it's missing piece; he lost interest because the books kept sliding off. If you made a plastic part that attached from the top and had a hinge on it that could just be lifted to put the books in, that might work better.For those little ones that love to color, it's a great toy, but as I said before, it needs to be made more durable.."
3,Opteka Slide Copier,"This unit arrived in record quick time, and with some practice does what it is intended for. My real complaint with it is the construction. It is just plain terrible, the slide mechanism is constantly jamming and gouging the slide carrier. Just very poor quality control. Also a stellar addition would be a negative holder, if they build it right. If you can put up with that I do recommend it."
1,"overstimulating, too much going on","Grandma bought this for our 6 month old daughter. I don't like that no matter which toy she plays with, the lights in the middle start blinking. I would prefer for each toy to just ""do its own thing."" For example, when she hits the bead rattle thing, she wants to look and listen to the beads, but gets distracted by all the blinking lights and music. Same is true for the banjo. I wish Grandma got the cheaper set of blocks, instead."
5,Great item for any baby.,"I bought this for my niece for Christmas when she was 5 months old. We sat on the floor playing with it for a couple of hours discovering all the different things it did. Her face would light up with every new discovery. A few months later I had the task of babysitting her and insisted that this toy be brought along. It kept her occcupied for a good chunk of the time her mom was away. Not one tear was shed since she was having fun. She also learned some words from it as she played with the different items, such as ""open"" when opening the one compartment on the side as well as the basic colours. The legs were also very sturdy was she was able to stand and lean on it for support. Highly recommend this item."
4,Love this toy!,My son got this table for his 1st birthday. He loves it. It tends to slide across our laminate floors so it doubles as a walker. :) It's very sturdy except for one little door that keeps coming off.
4,Be prepared for music,"My 7 month old daughter likes to play with the table increments of 5 minutes at a time. She beats on the piano keys; flips the book page back and forth -- warning -- we have had some finger squishing. She enjoys opening and closing the lid; spinning the rattle and pulling the banjo handle downward. It appears to amuse her and if she is happy then we are all happy.I recommend the table, but it's better if you place tape over the speaker to prevent it from being loud. Even at the lowest setting, its still can be pretty loud."
5,Loads of fun and grows with child,"This activity table is full of fun things to do from listening to music to playing with the instruments. It also works the motor skills (my daughter loves to open and close the pages to hear the alphabet and the little door to hear ""open and close""You can take the legs off when the child is younger, add 2 legs and slant it when they sit up and when the child starts to stand, add all 4 legs. My daughter always plays with it and learns the colors, shapes, and the words ""high"" and ""low"" and ""up and ""down"" etc. I highly recommend it."
5,Lousy Piece or Strong Child?,"We received this table for our daughter for Christmas 2003. Our daughter at the time was 8 months, the table was a wonderful learning tool for her, but she was able to pull off the purple door. I contacted the LeapFrog company and it took about a month to receive a new door, but the same thing keeps happening. Our daughter, now 11 months still pulls the door off, so we just leave it to the side. Overall I would give it 4 stars"
5,Watch out for electronic malfunctions,"We bought this toy for our one year old son. He loved the toy . . . the buttons are easy to push and respond very quickly. The songs and music are catchy too. We were really impressed with it in spite of the high price tag.However, after only two days of playing, the open/close compartment sensor wore out!We wanted to get him another one, but at such a high price tag it seemed risky in case another sensor went out! Instead, we bought an old fashioned xylaphone which he seems to love as well. And we save on batteries. As for teaching the alphabet and counting, well, I guess we need to be teaching parents instead of letting him learn everything on his own!"
5,Both my sons loved this toy!!,"My son received this as a Christmas gift when he was 8 months old. It did exactly what it said it would-my son would pull himself up to standing just to play with it. The music has character and he loved dancing to it. He learned the primary colors on it and loved switching from music to talking {by turing the page}. When my younger son got old enough {the boys are 14 months apart}, he too, enjoyed the music and went out of his way to play with it. The table is very durable-my guys are rough and tumble, so the table has been through alot, but still works perfectly. As most kids, they tire easily of toys, but the LeapFrog Learning table has stood the test of time. And, as ""Mommy"", the music doesn't drive me insane, as alot of toys do. :-)"
5,wonderful toy!,"my daughter plays w/ this table everyday- she loves the ""open/close""and the music.I've seen other activity tables-this is more user friendly and has much more to do. she is 11 mos and has been playing with it for 3 months. she never gets bored."
3,Does not good as I heard,"I bougth this table as the 1 year birthday gift for my son. To my suprised, my son does not like it at all, he even does not want to touch it. To be honest I do not like the table too, for I do not like the style of Jazz music, and it sounds noisy."
5,My two year old still loves it!,My son is almost two and he still walks up to this toy and plays with it. I think the alphabet and counting have helped him learn. It's a great gift idea.
5,Still using his Leap Frog Table at 2 years,My son got this table for his first birthday and this and his peeka a boo block train are the only toys hes still plays with. The batteries are still working the only problem we had is the purple door came off. Not a big deal it pops back in. This has been the best toy of all. It has taught him to hold him self up count and now were starting to learn our alphabet. He loves the music still but not as much as when he was little. All around one of the best toys.
3,Slide Bar Problems,"This toy is really neat overall, however, the slide bar that sings ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10!!"" has not worked properly for most of our ownership of this toy. It slides but doesn't play then out of the blue, starts to work again, then stops working again. I haven't tried to contact Leap Frog about it, but it is something to consider. It actually also starts playing music with no one touching it if it's left on (the off is way under it so usually it's left on the ON mode)...it's woken us up in the night a few times! I was upset that I paid $40 for something that doesn't function perfectly all the time!! Check to see if other reviewers had this same problem before buying this toy."
2,INCREDIBLY annoying!!!,"This is one of the most annoying toys that I have ever encountered. It is loud (even when set on the low setting) and has a very grating female voice in one of the two modes.When left in the ""on"" position, it also sometimes activates itself - gave me a huge scare in the middle of the night when I heard banging and went into my living room to find bright lights flashing around and banging noises!"
5,We love it,"I bought this for my son's 1st birthday a few months ago, and it was and still is a hit. I love Leap Frog products and this one is one of the best. It has 2 volume levels, cute music, removable sturdy legs, and bright colors. My son loves flipping the page and lifting the purple lid and playing the different types of music. It teaches abc's, numbers, colors, and shapes. It also teaches open/close, up/down. This has kept my son entertained for hours with the catchy music and blue lights. This table has been moved and tipped over numerous times and has never received a scratch on it...very durable.I have even had fun playing with it!!!!"
3,educational but not very durable,"My 17 month old likes this toy - it offers abc learning as well as 123 learning options - it plays cute music that he loves to listen to - he can also listen to different sounds of musical instruments - But - a few of the parts on the toy keep falling off- i have had this problem since day 1 - if he knocks the toy over the legs fall off and a door that teaches them the words ""open and close"" is always on the floor - i probably just bought a lemon of a toy - I would recommend the Intellitable by Fisher Price - we have this toy as well and it has more learning options on it and it is VERY durable."
4,Wonderful Toy!!!!,"My husband and I decided to purchase the LeapStart Table, when our son was 5 months, after noticing that his other toys were not holding his attention very long. We were amazed at how fast he caught on to the features; he is now 8-months and has truly mastered every aspect of the toy. He loves hitting the color keys, shapes and the roll pin, which resites the ABC's. He even knows how to flip the book page in the middle, that allows the table to switch from the learnining mode to the music mode; he lights up like a christmas tree and bounces when the music starts to play. Also, we love the fact that the table's legs are removable, to allow infants that are not quite ready to stand and play, to use the table as a lap toy. I would highly recommend this toy, it's absolutely great."
5,almost 2 and still loving it!!!,"This learning table is awesome. I bought this table for my daughter's first birthday and she is 23 months old and still playing with it and loving it. Their is a great variety of activities and different things to turn and spin and open. She is starting to get to the point where she now dances to the music and is saying some of the words. When she was younger it was great for her to pull herself up and stand and play and play. She loves it. I just bought 2 for baby gifts, they are a big hit. I have 3 friends that have one for there kids and they love them. well worth the money. Probably the best gift she got for her first birthday!!"
2,WOW!,This is totally not what I expected. If I were you I would think twice before I got this product. My son only played with it for about a day. After that first day he just got tired of it I guess. So like I said before think twice. I wish I would have.
4,Best investment out of all the toys I ever bought.,"I originally bought this toy when my oldest daughter was 9 months old. She learned how to stand with this toy and eventually learned to walk around the toy. Now that she is almost 4 years old, she still loves to play with this toy with her younger sister who is now 9 months old. They both absolutely love playing with this toy. And I have to say that out of all the toys I have ever bought, this one was the best investment out of all of them. We have definitely used this toy quite a bit. My only concern is that the bottom is not weighted. So, if your child leans on the toy you will need to stay nearby to make sure they don't fall and get hurt. When my oldest daughter was first learning how to stand, she hit her head when she fell forward."
5,One of my son's favorite toys,My son got this for Christmas (he was 5m old) and has loved it since day 1. In the beginning he played with it without the legs. Now that he is pulling himself up & standing well I have put the legs on & he LOVES to stand at the table & play.
3,Not My Son's Favorite Toy,"I purchased this toy for my son when he was about seven months old, and initially was very happy at how well it helped him to begin ""cruising"". He would use it to pull himself up and cruise all the way around the table, exploring the buttons. He does play with it every day, but not usually for more than three minutes at a time. I have two major problems with this toy. First, the little ""Open/Close"" flap comes off far too easily. Second, I find the woman's voice on the ""alphabet page"" to HIGHLY irritating."
4,Great toy!,"My mom got this for my baby on his first birthday. He loves it! If you flip the page in the book, it either does number and letter songs or musical pieces. It plays a lot of different songs and such, so you don't get tired of hearing it. My only complaint is that my son loves to flip through books and the book on this only has one page."
4,Very Educational:),"This is a great toy! It is very educational, and the music is not ""annoying"" as some of the musical toys are. This ones volume adjusts to high or low. And it has the music mode or alphabet mode. My son loves the music mode, he stands there and bobs back and forth everytime the toy is on. He loves it and I think it is definatly worth the money. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the fact that ""I"" don't think the legs are very sturdy. My son was almost 11 months when he started walking, and he had been standing for months. When he use to stand there it made me nervous because he would just about pull it over on himself! I think if your child is pulling himself or herself up on things, I would take two of the legs off so it is kinda on the floor!"
5,THE BEST TOY,"At first I was not sure if I wanted to spend this much money for a toy ( I mean how long do the toys last 3-4 month and then they grow out of them), but this is definately a GREAT INVESTMENT.We bought this toy when my baby was 6 month now she is 14 month and she still plays with it everyday for a few hours. Sometimes 30-35 min at the time!!!! Its trully a great toy and it grows with the baby.ITS GREAT!!!!!!!"
4,"Great Toy, But.....","Having just bought this toy recently, my experience is limited, however it is definitely educational, is easy on parents ears (the music is not the teeth-clenching, annoying kind some other toys have), and has activities aplenty to keep my almost 9 month old son occupied.I bought it to give him something to stand and play with (he also has a Classical Chorus Piano which he LOVES), and walk around, as he's on the verge of walking but not quite. Its very useful for that purpose, and sturdy enough to pull up on comfortably.The only thing that disappoints me about this toy is its size. I expected it to be larger at least in height, and would have appreciated adjustable legs for some added longjevity. My son is just about average height, and it is the perfect size for him right now (he even tries to get his leg up onto it which he doesnt bother doing with larger toys). It is not an inexpensive toy, so I had hoped to get a lot of play out of it...only time will tell."
4,Cute toy.,We bought this toy thinking that it was the bilingual version. It is not but still has plenty of activities for your child. My daughter loves dancing to the ABC's and numbers. The singer makes her laugh for some reason. She also loves the banjo frog. Overall this was a good buy even if I would have preferred the more complex version. She doesn't seem to care.
2,Items in mirror are SMALLER than they appear,"I ordered this tripod for a temporary mounting solution for my DirecTV dish at a condo. It looked like a sturdy mount and would suit me well sitting on the corner of the patio. I got it, and was puzzled at the small box. It's TINY. Super small. Reducto small. I have an oval 5lnb capable dish and it would have toppled over at the slightest breeze with this thing. I put it together and when I realized ""that's it???"" (did I say tiny? not to mention cheap thin tubing legs...) it quickly went back in the box and now I'll lose shipping $$$.This is absolutely NOT worth $50. For $17 at the local home improvement store I got a bucket, 80lbs of concrete and a fence pole that was tall enough and a sturdier mount.Incredibly disappointed."
1,Not stable in breezey conditions,"This tripod is not stable at all in any breeze or wind, regardless of how the center is anchored. Easy enough to set up, but fails in the stability department. Wound up selling at a flea market. Would not purchase again."
1,Beware,I wanted a simple MP3 player to take to school. I definitly got that. This player is a piece of junk. The memory erases when I plug in the usb cable. My computer also freezes when I try to use the manager. I've contacted Digitalway many times with no response. Thank goodness I only paid forty 2 dollars. I still feel I got ripped off. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!
1,Deceptive Published Specifications,"I just purchased a Canon 8400F scanner which is marketed as having a maximum optical resolution of 3200 dpi. Only after setting up the scanner, did I discover that its true maximum optical resolution is 1600 dpi for refelective (flatbed) scanning. The higher, 3200 dpi resolution is available only when scanning film. The published specifications do not make any distinction between reflective and film scanning with regard to the maximum optical resolution, which I find very misleading. I have owned or used scanners from other manufacturers and have not encountered this discrepancy between published specs and actual specs."
4,Great Machine,Love it! The only minor issue I have is that the color from negatives always ends up being a little on the green side but it's an easy fix in photoshop.
1,"Very Poor focus, scanned photos not sharp","This is the 4th Scanner I have owned. From a Acer to HP . Purchased this because it had a film and slide scan function that was advertised as producing clear and sharp copies. But this individual one was a factory slip up.Scans of flat photos are not as sharp as any of the previous scanners produced. Nor are the slide scans as sharp as those I got from a Genie scanner 7 years ago.Needs to have a focus test as part of the factory acceptance tests, AND a acceptable standard passed before shipment, with the result included with the unit.."
2,New Scanner - no better than my 7 yr old one,"I was very excited to purchase this scanner and anxiously awaited it's arrival. It looked cool upon opening it and the scanner itself seems wonderful. However, the PageManager Software that comes along with it is just cumbersome and quirky. I used to have an HP scanner and it's software/tools were way more fluid and intuitive.I have been a graphic artist for more than 5 yrs and this software is just not that good. The options for editing your scan need more in-betweens the default settings make pictures way too dark everytime. I get error messages that there is a corrupt file with the software. I am going to try to re-install. But it was installed on a new pc running Win XP and everything should have been simple... but the complexities have not ended yet."
5,CanoScan 8400f Works!,"I just received my CanoScan 8400f two days ago. After sending back my Konica/Minolta Dimage that was defective, I had to try something diferent. After reading all the reviews on this CanoScan 8400f I said maybe this will be the one!1. I had a little problem on installing, but that was takencare of by the great tech over at Canon USA. Excellent serviceI had, 20 mins total and I was Scanning Away........My 1st picture was a color 4X6 and was 'sharp as a tac'!Now I scanned about 20 Slides, they take a little over a minuteeach when using high resolution. But it's worth it! Very Clear and pretty good color! The only thing I noticed a couple lookeda little darker than the actual slide, but there are lots ofenhancement buttons in ArcSoft Photo Studio & Adobe photo to lighten/contrast & other fun neat stuff.I do like it a lot, that why I gave it 5 stars....."
3,Seems to be overrated by most,"I recently purchased a new 8400F believing that it would scan my negatives at similar quality as the basic picture cd that comes with prints, but was mistaken. The picture cd, while lower total resolution, was far sharper than anything the 8400F could produce at any size. The 6.99 picture cd is sadly superior. I was quite disappointed in the negative scanning ability both with B&W and color film. The comparisons pretty much say it all. Even with Vuescan, things weren't better and there's no Silverfast software support available."
4,CanoScan 8400F Flatbed Scanner,"Excellent scanner; easy to set up; has been fairly easy to use. Main complaint: No hard copy manual. The manual is available only as an electronic version on a CD and Canon cannot supply a hard copy. The manual can not be printed as a whole, only one page at a time. Canon tech help was useless in finding a way to print the manual; they supplied a reference to a program that would only work with a Canon printer. Brute fource and awkwardness prevailed; I printed a manual one page at a time."
1,Short life span,"My CanoScan 8400f failed about six weeks after the warranty expired.I contacted tech support and they were very polite and prompt, but we couldn't get it to work.I took it to an authorized repair facility, but Canon doesn't repair these low-end scanners. If it's under warranty, they replace it. If it's past warranty, you're stuck. They offered me a 10% discount on a new one, but that's more than the Amazon price with no discount.Thus, I am stuck with a big, shiny CanoScan doorstop. Bummer."
1,Don't buy a Canon Scanner,"I have had this scanner for 1.5 years (warranty is one year). I did not use it much at all, maybe a hundred scans, but likely less. It spent most of it's time in the off position, turning it on only when needed. Today it died on the first of 6 scans. This is my second Canon scanner that died not long after warranty expired. I will not allow a third opportunity. Maybe you can learn from my mistakes.I have an old Hewlett Packard 4C scanner that I paid $1000 for 13 years ago. It is built like a tank and it still works like a champ except that HP never provided Windows XP drivers for it. We live in such a disposable world now."
1,Failed in 10 months!,"Looked like a good product, but 10 months later it's junk. Has a lifetime warrantee, but Amazon doe not warrantee it, so I guess I have to try to get Dorman to make good on it."
4,Works great,"Great product.... installation was very easy. Only down side.... delivery was slow. It took longer to get than expected. When your window is not working, time is important."
1,Poor quality.,"This puzzle looked so cute with the rainbow so I have to have it for my girls. However, I was disappointed when I opened the box. For sixty pieces puzzle cost more than eighteen dollars and the material is really poor. Some even cracked with winkles. I called right away and got it returned."
4,Jr Globe Explorer,Great way to introduce the world to young kids. with sound affects and places to find makes it much more appealing to little ones.
3,Watch out!!,They are not manufacturing this toy anymore!!! The pen of ours is broken and Leapfrog just gave me a 15% on a new toy because they can't do anything about it. There are no replacement parts available for the toy!! So watch out if you are planning on buying it. It is a fun toy and my kids loved it.
2,Too Simplistic,I ended up returning this item after receiving it. I was disappointed in the amount of geographic detail this globe provided. It only identified continents and oceans without identifying countries or states. I felt too big an emphasis was placed on the animals. My children were not interested in it. They are 3 & 4. I ended up purchasing the traditional explorer globe for them as I felt they would get more out of it.
4,Highly Recommended Ancient Music,"What a treat! French the way it was, before the Renaissance, before the Enlightenment, before everyone spoke like Maurice Chevalier. Best's love for Provenal is evident, and he infuses reverence and irreverence alike into these selections. Fine examples for any would-be Troubador. Good historical info and English lyrics in the liner notes. Provenal lyrics are the only things lacking."
4,Excellent,"excellent product, this game if it is durable, but the trouble is that it only comes once products.My children of 8 and 4 have fun"
3,Not as educational as you would think,"This set is made of good quality plastic. The test tubes are sturdy and easy for a child to handle. The experiments are appropriate for very small children with bright color and easy steps. My disappointment is that they are essentially just magic tricks since there is absolutely NO EXPLANATION OF THE SCIENCE. For example one experiment is to use Easter egg dye and add absorbent polymers to make jello like ""crystals"". The color is pretty, but there is no mention of how our bodies use a similar polymer to make cartilage and other connective tissues shock absorbent, or how this principle is used in industry. Like I said, they are basically magic tricks since no science is explained. Good quality, but would be better with some education added."
3,Fast-paced fun,"My 4-year-old just received this track for Christmas, and he and his 6-year-old brother are having a ball with it. My only complaint is the cars have to be run at top speed to get through the flaming hoop, but the speed makes them fly off the track easily. At lower speeds, they fall off the end of the track instead of jumping the hoop. If the track pieces come apart (like when they trip on the track or step on it), an adult must put them back together since they snap together pretty hard. It is definitely better made than the Hot Wheels tracks we own."
4,Schmidt's Quartets Unfairly Neglected,"A contemporary of Mahler, Franz Schmidt is an unfairly neglected late-Romantic Viennese composer. His quartets are bright, soft, intelligent, and sumptuous, with a thickly complex sound typical of the music of Schmidt's age. While they might not be profound enough to deliver a religious experience or catharsis, they are strong pieces, and I recommend them for anyone who is a fan of Schmidt, late-Romantic music, or works for string quartets."
4,Good read for the DIY'er,"Good book, very informative. Covers a lot, has many tips and tricks. Make sure you get a licensed plumber to look at your work though because codes change all the time.Bob[...]."
3,needs updating plus,"I am planning to replumb my house, and I was leaning toward pex for my supply, and of course there is next to nothing in this book. Also, on pg 22, the author states; not a big deal, if you penetrate pvc vent pipe with a screw. The town plumbing inspector I am familar with, was not impressed, and either were the two plumbers I spoke to."
2,Very Disappointing Amazon Purchase.....Singers...Not just Music!,"I just received this cd today and played it, and literally 11 out of the 12 songs on this cd have either a man or a woman singing in French. When I ordered it, I thought the entire CD was an instrumental. As I said in the title, VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! 9/30/10"
5,Coltons Fan,"This is the first in The Colton Family series. I got ""hooked"" with the story of Sophie & River and the underlying story of Senator Joe Colton, Meredith & Patsy very quickly and couldn't wait to read the whole series. Each book stands alone with the story of it's main characters, but the reader is always left wanting more about the Joe & Meredith (as well as the other Coltons)So far I have read the first five books in the series. This book is still among my favorites."
3,Learning Hoop Basketball,"I was dissapointed with the Learning Hoop Basketball. The music is so boring that my 11-month old baby walked away after 3 minutes throwing the ball in the basket. He once in a while passed by the toy, throw the boy and walked away again as the same music came up after his throw. It would be more interested if music has changed after a throw.Besides, the CAT button doesn't do much good for the kid. Only 4 words are being spelled.I still want to give a good compliment in the physical quality of the toy. It looks good, sturdy with a cute frog and very strong. I am not worried about my baby will break it if he was a little rough to the toy.This toy could be better off with more variety of music instead of just one tone all the time. For a while, I feel like it is torturing me with that same music."
4,love it,my son loves throwing things into holes this was an excellent toy to teach letter and nurmbers while having fun
2,doen't get played with,my son got this for christmas at 7mo old he is now a year almost and he doesn't even play with it. he just chews on the basketballs. nothing has broke on it but he doesn't play with it either.
2,"Review on info, NOT product itself!","This review isn't on the video. I have seen this mini series and it is excellent. Richard Armitage makes the character of John Porter vulnerable and a hero at the same time. He is not unbelievable. It is well written, and the actors, especially Armitage did an exceptional job.My review is solely on the info given. I loved this series so much, I wanted to add it to my video collection. I am in the US and need to have it ""Region 1"" or ""Region Free."" This item states it as ""Region Free"" yet reviews say otherwise. I do not want to go to the trouble ordering something that I cannot play.I am a big customer of Amazon's. I use Amazon for much of my shopping, especially at Christmas. But this is one area I am disappointed. Please make research and make clear whether or not this item is viewable in the United States. If it is not, please do whatever is possible to make one available soon! I'm sure it would sell like hotcakes!Thank you!"
1,POSSIBLE SOLUTION,"Seems a potential solution to address this issue would be for some strong seller, e.g., AMAZON, to press for a Region 1 version that could be sold to everyone in the US. I know Amazon's return policy is great, but it's still a hassle to buy something on the chance it MIGHT work in your player. I'd rather not have to go thru the buy and return process. For what it's worth..."
1,Not Region 1,"Unfortunately, this DVD will not play on U.S. DVD players, and this is very disappointing.With Richard Armitage poised to become a major star in America with the release of The Hobbit, and Andrew Lincoln already well known for his work on The Walking Dead, this DVD would sell like hotcakes. Why isn't there a region 1 version? It makes no sense."
3,Not worth it,"Don't waste your time. The book gives a brief overview of African culture, but it is not something to just pick up and read."
1,Injustice!,If you like GNR then im thinking you should avoid this so called tribute. Folksy GNR is almost as bad as Sheryl Crow's cover of Sweet Child o mine. Why cant somebody get this tribute thing down? But on the other hand... if you like folksy music then this might just be your bag.
1,"Did not like it, boring, dialogue sucked, couldn't finish it","This movie sucked and did not appear, IMHO, to be professionally made. The special effects overlapped the actors arms & hands during multiple scenes. Really bad!!!!"
5,Cushy comfort,"Ordering my second pad, my outdoor semi ferals love these. Just follow the directions and let the air out and they will be so much softer than the hard plastic version.Fits perfect in the Kitty tube and keeps them warm and cozy, otherwise it would be a miserable harsh winter for them. Comes with a soft cover and is easy to clean. When you first plug it in it takes a few to start feeling the warmth but after you apply some gentile pressure you'll start to feel the soft heat. Kitties catch on real quick or a little cat nip will draw them right to it. Fast drlivery excellant product and it has the no chew cord.Best idea yet in pet heating pads. I love Amazon :)"
2,I ended up giving this away...,"It may be a good product but at least put the right size dog on the advertisement photo because the medium isnt that big at all and looking at the dog on the pic would be incorrect, on the medium only a full grown cat can fit on it. I bought this for my lab and he could only lay his head on it, I felt no warmth at all and I should have just bought him a heating blanket in his bed would have been cheaper and warmer. This may be a good product but I didnt see it perform. Easy instructions and seems duarable but the little cover slides right off when the pet moves around on it."
4,Pretty durable but could be more durable,"I've had one of these for months now for my German Shepherd. I liked it so much I bought another one, but I am concerned about the long-term durability. I found a tear in one of them already (not from chewing since my dog doesn't chew it). It seems tough, but dogs can be tougher... so I am subtracting one star. Also, the ""free"" cover it comes with can come off so I have tried using packing tape to secure it better. Overall I'd give it 4 stars. Great idea, good implementation but I wish it was even tougher so my dog wouldn't have put a tear in it already.Pros* Great for pets in cold weather* Thermostat controlled/power efficient (medium uses 40 watts when warming)* Could with a ""free"" soft cover but cover can come offCons* Could be more durable (my dog put a tear in it)"
5,Purrrfect for my older cat,"I purchased this item for my older cat to snuggle on. I ordered this in medium which is plenty big, even for a 15 pound cat. I do notice every once in a while it makes a funny sound, not sure what this is from, anyhow I would highly recommend this product for any animal that likes to keep toasty warm."
3,K&H 1080 Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed,"The product is ok, but it really doesn't seem to be that warm. I placed a book on pad after plugging it in to represent the weight of an animal as directions said. I have it placed in an Igloo Dog House for my outdoor cat and the cat is sleeping on it so maybe it's getting warmer than I think. So if the cats happy I am happy. I thought it was a little pricey."
4,Great product and my dog loves it!,This has been great! I wanted something for my dog so she wouldnt be freezing and i wouldnt feel bad for for leaving her out. She never gets off of it. Ive had it for over a month and it still works and has held up. Glad I ordered it! Will order another if i ever need it!
3,nicely built but not as hot as I had hoped,Bought this for my no hair cats. worked okay but it does not get as hot as some other cat warmers that I have.
5,My cats love it,"Before buying this I worried my cats wouldn't stay on it long enough to figure out it gets warm (since it needs weight to begin warming up), but they caught on quickly and use it a lot. Shipping was really fast, too."
1,Does not work at all.,"After reading the review, I was expecting a great product. However, after carefully unpacked the product and followed the instruction, the product does not work at all. The heat produced was so weak that I could not tell if it was from my hand or from the pad. Disappointed. Returned the product."
4,Outside heated pad,"My cat loves this heated pad, & it really warms up well. He is an outside cat on a covered deck."
3,Works,"It does the job, it does work, but does not seem all that comfortable and not enough power to put heat through a blanket that I tried to use to make it more comfy. I would probably get it again but if I was designing it, I would make some changes"
3,Heats well but frustrating cover,"This is the second of these we've bought. They do seem to heat well. However, the cover for the pad does not stay on. It comes off every night and has to be fixed every morning. I just wish the cover fit better and stayed in place."
5,My cat is now warm outside,I have a cat who won't come inside anymore. He has an gum disease and the other cats pick on him. This heating pad is just wonderful....only works when he goes into his house and lays on it. Without out...he'd be cold. Works great! Don't know what I would have done without it. Also easy to clean. Highly recommend!
3,Was not so amazed with the product,"I received it just the exact day I was suppose to, I need this for my outdoor dog. I live in Chicago so its freezing on the winter, but as far as the bed once I got it and tested it, came to find out that it was not even that warm as it was suppose to be on the first place so... I dont know...."
3,"A good idea, but with its draw-backs","On kayaking and rafting trips, I have been concerned to have my back-up memoriy cards and batteries safely stored, but easy to access when needed. This sounded like the answer to the problem. It is water-tight, which meets the first requirement, however, it fits so tightly that it is hard to open and close the box to get at and then put away the gear. Also, the product discription did not specify that this was designed specifically to hold Canon camera batteries. The battery for my Pentax compact camera bounces around inside the box and the battery for my Sony DSLR can't fit inside at all! If I had known that I couldn't very well use it to store my batteries, I would have ordered the model which holds more cards and no batteries.I was very disappointed that the discription was not more indicative of the product."
5,Jazzy Beat for Oldies,Years ago I had an album of Quartette Tres Bien which featured mostly oldies (big band type) that were given a jazzy treatment. Very mellow and enjoyable. Wish I could find more of their music. The Sergio Mendes music was a definite bonus.Gary Huhn
2,Mystery Classics 100,"The background noise in these movies was so loud, I could not understand the dialogue at all. I have purchased old movies in the past, and even if the sound track was not perfect, I could understand what was being said. Not so with these. The movies were great -- the sound was terrible!"
3,duplication and lip synchronization,"I love old movies and could not restrain my self so I bought the 50 pack and the 100 movie pack, thinking they would be 150 different movies; but the 100 movie pack contained all of the same movies on the 50 movie pack..so it was wasted money for the 50 pack of movies..some of the other movies packs also contained duplications as well. I know it is my fault for not reading the fine print..but I still like the movies and they have done a good job of copying the movies but the sound and lip synchronization is off on some of the movies which makes itMystery Classics 100 Movie Packhard to watch.."
3,"NOT BAD, BUT DEFINTELY NOT THEIR BEST.","ALTHOUGH THIS ALBUM HAS SOME GOOD SONGS, I WAS VERY SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF POWER IN THE SONGS. UNLIKE JUGULATOR WHICH CAUGHT ME COMPLETELY SURPISED WITH ITS COMBINATION OF DEATH METAL AND OLD STYLE PRIEST, THIS ALBUM HAS SOME MAJOR DEFECTS. SONGS SUCH AS CLOSE TO YOU, JEKYLL AND HYDE, AND ONE ON ONE ALMOST SOUND LIKE TECHNO POP, AND THE GUITAR SOLOS(OR LACK THEREOF)ARE TERRIBLE.ON THE OTHER HAND SONGS LIKE HELL IS HOME AND METAL MESSIAH ARE THE REASON I KEPT THE CD INSTEAD OF TOSSING IT. THE STUDIO ALBUM IS A LITTLE BETTER WITH TWO OUTSTANDING BONUS TRACKS RAPID FIRE AND A REMAKE OF THE GREEN MANILISHI WITH THE TWO PRONGED CROWN WHICH IN MY OPINION IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. IS IT WORTH BUYING? THAT DEPENDS ON THE BUYER, LIKE I SAID ITS OK, BUT NOT THEIR BEST."
1,Wonk Wonk Wonk,"Judas Priest without Rob Halford is as awful as Van Halen without David Lee Roth(though Dave did kind of lose it, didn't he?) and Metallica without Cliff Burton(R.I.P.'Bro), with the last example being totally unavoidable but a prime example of what happens when a, if not THE Cornerstone of a band departs, sadly and unexpectedly or otherwise. We all know why ""someone"" didn't want Rob in the band, and we all know that ""his"" version of Priest was as lame as his lyric writing. I wouldn't use this to pick my teeth. But who cares? Rob is BACK! LONG LIVE ""THE BEAST THAT IS THE PRIEST!!!"""
3,If it had less songs....,"The trouble with DEMOLITIOn is that Priest does not have the necessary consistency anymore to release THIRTEEN new songs !...So, if they focused a little bit more in the best part of the material and did not release a 70 minute long album, probabbly DEMOLITON would have been a total winner, much better than JUGULATOR.But, as it is, it has so much high and low moments that sometimes you're annoyed."
2,Rob Halford where art thou?,Halford is to Priest what Ozzy is to Sabbath. Minus the classic frontmen...all your left with is a band a few notches above Spinal Tap without the humor. Save your money and buy the remastered versions of the early Judas Priest albums.For hardcore fans only.
5,First Priest LP...and So Far It Kick @$$,I can't say much......all I can say is it's nice and heavy...what I except from a metal CD.GET IT NOW!
4,A good album get over it,It isn' the original Judas Priest but it's still a good album. The guitar riffs are descent and the overall organization of the music is well produced. If you want the original Judas Priest go buy the album and get over the fact Rob is no longer in the band. For everyone who thinks the bands writing is worst now that Rob left are idiots. Rob didn't write the guitar riffs from the earlier albums. Most of the people writing about this are those who can't even play a flute let alone write music.
3,Better than expected.,"This CD is by no means another ""Sad Wings of Destiny"" or ""Hell Bent For Leather"". In fact, this sounds more like Metallica than Priest! (The ballads more recall ""one"", ""welcome"" and ""fade to black"" than ""dreamer deceiver"", ""before the dawn"" and ""run of the mill"".) But Priest have managed to recapture some (just some) of their late 70s/early 80s glory. Gone is the death metal/grunge approach of the totally unlistenible ""Jugulator"". With a return to melody Priest have managed to show decent signs of maturity with ""hell is home"" and ""feed off me"". Not all of it works, however (and it DIDN'T need to be 71 minutes!). The songs are padded with pointless noises and a few tracks could have been left on the cutting room floor. But for hardcore Priest fans this will help remove the bad taste left from ""Jugulator""."
5,Better than Jugulator,"This album rocks it's diffrent from all the previous priest albums,Tim the ripper owens rules he is one of the best singers in the whole world."
3,PC,I was not pleased that I had to do $200 more in it to even get it up and running.Ad should have read Needs Work.
3,Books that I enjoyed,I started reading Bob Myer when I bought my Kindel. After this book and a few others I am sure there will be more read on my Kindel.
3,"Good, but standard","Excellent overall playing, decent sound. My usual complaint - too slow in the three adagio movements. Adagio does not mean slow, it means relaxed or easeful, and indicates mood not speed. Played at the typical speeds - someone like the conductor Bruno Weil is an exception, who usually paces better, i.e. faster - the adagios are sluggish, the phrasing occasionally awkward, certain notes unduly stretched and pauses overlong and lacking tension. Too slow speeds in adagios undermines their sprightliness, which is a feature of Haydn's writing almost invariably missed by the sleepy brigade."
1,Tastes terrible,"Bought this after seeing the health benefits on Dr. Oz, but it tastes so bad, I cannot force it down to get those benefits."
5,Great upgrade for the price!,This is a spectacular value as an upgrade to your stock or worn crankset. It is light weight and strong. I'm not sure as to the weight but it was noticeably lighter than the stock set on my bike. I do alot of steep mountain biking in Oregon and the 22 tooth short gear is a great way to get more torque on the inclines.
4,Great album but get the double-cd,"No doubt that this is a great album, and was undeservedly long out of print (due to problems securing musical permissions), but true fans should go for the recently digitally-remastered 2CD version of the Cosmos soundtrack which came out at the same time as the new DVD/VHS set of the series. That includes one previously unavailable Vangelis piece ""Comet 16"" amongst a total of 28 tracks."
1,The Tape Less Tolerated And Beyond...,"Much as I admire Peck's earlier books, I simply must warn others that this tape is a trip down a different road entirely. It is largely autobiographical, but not interesting. Frankly, I haven't been able to make myself listen to the second half of it. If this is the key to ""Spiritual Growth in an Age of Anxiety,"" then I think I'll just stick with listening to traffic reports during my commute."
2,Thinking and being spiritual,"Tedious. Dr. Peck spends a lot of time referring back to his many other books. Don't pick this up if you want to research anxiety. You won't find more than general answers. Dr. Peck does tell us his success is due to his prioritizing of his spirituality. And I respect that. He refers to God as ""she"", and tells us he spends three 45 minute sessions meditating/praying most days. This is how he has become so amazingly productive in his life. It does remind me of that old saint Martin Luther who supposedly said, ""I have so much to do today. I must spend more time in prayer."" Overly wordy."
3,Peck 2,"It takes a lot of reading to get the tidbits - BUT I did get good stuff about life being complex - not one thing happens to cause another thing - but rather 40-50 things from the past cause the one thing going on now in your life. So, to try to change one thing to get yourself to change is ridiculous!!"
3,"Mucks up easily, but an easy clean","I use the 1 Plus filter in a small tank with 3 small-to-medium turtles in it. While the filter is incredibly easy to clean, it requires cleaning about three times as often as the other filters I've used, making it about even with other filter options.As a replacement insert, it can't get much easier - pop out the old and put in the new. It is also a fairly easy sponge to clean, even when really mucky, but the sponge gets less effective dramatically quicker than other filter foam. With one critter or several clean ones, this won't be a big deal, but multiple critters will make this otherwise-great filter average."
5,A Real Page Turner,"I'm a commercial software developer, and found the author's history of the UNIX culture and the story of its evolution into what we now call Open Source to be fascinating. That alone made it a good read for me. Add in the thought provoking analysis of the ""whys"" (the real point of this book), and it's a killer combo.Warning: the book is *full* of sentences like ""Pluralism at many different levels is being enabled by communications technologies and by experimentation with property; together, these are reducing the marginal cost of adding voices toward an asymptote of zero."" Despite that, I've been able to read it at the pace of a thriller, not a textbook."
2,Please save your pennies,"I bought this book because I needed a read and was busted at the time. This book reminds me of my 10th grade reasearch paper. Short clips, pictures second hand. It contained very little actual information on the period,reasons or construction. I give it one point for effort and another because it has pictures. It might be good for an elementary school or junior high library to do a short paper with. Otherwise save your pennies."
1,so so bad a movie,"These people leaving good reviews are lying. This film was so bad that I rushed to go trade it in the next morning at best buy's dvd trade-in for select blu-ray's sale. I understand the meaning on the film and what happened, but there are still alotta holes. And what is up with the stupid snakes. This movie is so low budget too. I could go on and on....."
3,Interesting historical information with much digression.,"Biographical information on the band members (and just about everyone else connected with them) and a decent amount of pictures (childhood included) make this a good addition to a fan's collection. The author, however, goes off on tangents, discussing subjects barely peripheral to the band"
2,Not Impressed,"I am really not all that impressed with this, especially for the price. The spray is more of a stream than a true spray - a manual spray bottle does a much better job. The convenience of auto spray is nice - but it is fairly loud & annoying. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,wast of money,"this thing does not work, it does not mist it streams. the motor is not as strong as it should be. i set it to mist every hour for 60s and when i awoke the next day the humitiy was only at 40% but the bottom of tank was soaking wet"
2,Disappointing debut,"With a great title and subject, it's too bad Bajwa couldn't turn out a novel of greater interest and skill. Ramchand, the main character, is just not interesting enough to carry the weight of the story, and his central perspective limits the story's range. Her most believable characters were the middle-class ladies; they could have appeared more prominently. Her upper-class belles were soap-opera concoctions. A Fine Balance, The Namesake and Brick Lane all have far more merit."
2,rich and poor in India,"This novel gives a strong portrayal of the vast inequities between the entitled rich and the poor, working class in India, but beyond that the plot is very loose and unwieldy. It is really just an account of a few months in the life of a sari shop salesperson and the people he meets and the experiences that befall him. Some of the things that happen - like he winds up unknowingly being the model for a character in a book - make me wonder if they were ever intended to have more significance later on in the story - something to tie all the experiences together in the end. But this never happens, and the tale ends as randomly as it begins. I wasn't left wanting more, but it felt like something was missing."
1,Please Read Technical Criticism of Don Burleson Before Buying,"Don Burleson has his name on more Oracle books than (I believe) any other author. However, many other experts on the Oracle database spend a significant portion of their time debunking errors and misinformation that he disseminates in articles and books like these. [...] where a search for ""Burleson"" will turn up several articles which point out inaccuracies in his articles or statements."
1,ArgutMark is a RIPOFF!!!,ArgutMark is a RIPOFF. I ordered this item from ArgutMark and was charged $25. ArgutMark never shipped the product and never responded to my emails. I am currently trying to get my money back.
4,not as pictured,The strap is well made and exactly as described but the photo shows the ends folded over an sewn to make it easier to connect to tow hooks and d-rings. This is not the case the ends have a loop but it is just as wide as the strap which makes it more difficult to work with. I attached to d-rings to the ends which makes it easier to connect when recovering the vehicle.
3,Lightsabre,"Quite annoyed with this product, it was desrcibed along the lines ' first time a full size yoda lightsabre was available' As I was buying three lightsabres for three kids I wanted them all to be the same size and it was because of the description I purchased this one. It turns out to be actually smaller than the other light sabres so there was disagreement between the kids as to who gets which one. Other than the size product is good!"
4,Awesome Toys,The puppet I ordered was an awesome toy for children. Shipping was quick. It was what I expected it to be. If you want a great toy for your children buy this!
3,"Well-made, but didn't work at all for us","We've had bad luck with swaddling in general, but I tried this on the strong recommendation of friends and the reviews here. It didn't work at all, and in fact might have been even worse for our fussy, flailing baby. Oh well. It's also quite a bit trickier to actually get wrapped correctly than I thought it would be. The videos make it look like you can just flip a few flaps and have a nice swaddle, but if the baby is even a bit wriggly, it's hard to get right.As in everything baby: your milage may vary."
2,Did not Work for Us,We purchased this on the recommendation of others that it was the swaddle of all swaddles. We tried it for a couple of nights and our son was able to break out every night. We would come in only to find his hands escaped and pushing everything up towards his head. My sister in law swears by it but it just did not work for us. I much prefer those with velcro such as the summer brands since they keep him in nice and tight.
4,great idea,"i really like this miracle blanket i purchased. baby always fusses when i put him in it, but after awhile when he gets all snuggly and i breastfeed him or rock him in it, he will usually fall fast asleep. he is 5mo and scratches his head like crazy, so this blanket has helped so much from keeping him from rubbing his face raw all night. the only thing is he always kicks his legs out somehow and he'll wake up with cold legs! maybe for a smaller baby it would work best, but i still use it everynight."
1,PoE review,BB-HCM531 camera requires 48V and 130 mA poewr over Ethernet. It won't work with 5V-12V power inserter. Be aware using D-Link product.
1,Fail NOT 802.3af compliant CRAP aleart.,"I'm giving this one star because no where in the description of this item nor in the manual that came with the device does it indicate that this is not 802.3af compliant. I had to hook it up to my Panasonic WV-SW172 POE camera only to have it not power on and frustrate me to pieces. Oh come on DLink. I mean what are you? Third graders? Please, somewhere in your item description could you please say that your crap is not 802.3af compliant."
2,Does not work with Gigabit!,"I reviewed te tech specs on this item carefully before buying. The technical descriptions do not state any bandwidth limitations, only that CAT5 wiring is supported. Upon installation, and reviewing the fine print on the last page of the manual, it turns out that this device does in fact not support 1000Mbps connections.It will work fine for normal use around the house, but if you are looking specifically for high-speed networking devices, don't get this one. Calling D-Link customer service was a load full of wasted time. The representatives have no technical knowledge, don't the the device from another, and generally give incorrect information. Even speaking with a supervisor was highly disappointing. As a result, I will stay clear from D-Link going forward."
3,Pills - I Preach to Party,"I Preach to Party is an extremely enjoyable song, but I think this single was a bit overkill. If you listen to each track individually, you love it, listen to one right after another, and it will drive you crazy. Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy this release, it was just too much at once. And just as the last track ends and you think it's over, no, prepare yourself for another seven minutes of a'cappella. That was downright annoying. But overall the mixes are great, when taken in small doses."
1,Does not work,"This compass does not work. I was using a different compass and was accurate to 2 or 5 degrees. I bought this one from Winegard due to their reputation in the industry, hoping for greater accuracy. When I placed this compass on the dish, it would change by 45% with slight movement. It's junk. A free iphone app is more accurate."
4,Good information but not all that original,"The book boils down to a well written rehash of Princes' material from previous writings on marriage, siritual warfare, fasting, etc. Loads of scripture. Good selection for someone who hasn't read much Prince yet."
3,Just OK,"This monitor is just OK, but the speakers are not really worth it for any kind of heavy use and the volume control is awkward, and it only has VGA input. I just bought a similar monitor for about $100 from a local retailer, and it has DVI input and a shaper image."
5,ATOMIC1701,"WAS LOOKING FOR A FLAT SCREEN WITH ATTACHED SPEAKERS LIKE MY FIRST COMPUTER HAD AND THIS ONE DID IT, WAS EASY TO HOOK UP -- TURN ON -- ADJUSTED BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST AND WAS GOOD TO GO---LOVE IT......."
3,Cute but Small,"Description did not give measurements but I expected this to be a little bigger then it is. It is slightly larger then a Beanie Baby. Soft, cute and well made though."
1,Worst Protein Powder Ever,"I am a long time Amazon Prime user who has never reviewed a product, that is until now. I bought this product to try to break up the monotony of chocolate and vanilla so I was very excited to try it. My excitement was short lived however because from the moment this ""stuff"" touched my lips I wanted to vomit. It has the worst metallic and bitter flavor. Only on Fear Factor would this be considered refreshing. I finished the whole tub but it took me 3 months to do it and I pinched my nose the who way. RUN do not walk from this product, you'll thank me for it. I want to suggest other products to try but I dont want anyone thinking I had alterior motives for this review. PLEASE heed my warning and go elsewhere for protein."
3,"Okay, but not great.","The book itself was in good condition, but smelled like basement. A good read, though. Thanks!"
1,awful,"This book is absolutely awful. Character descriptions aren't much more than about how strong or muscular they are, and their motivations are totally simplistic. The villains are overwhelmingly evil (demons that just want to destroy everything..?), the heroes are overwhelmingly good..Well maybe this book is targetted more for children and I was just dumb for reading it :)"
3,I don't get it,"Ok, I have to admit it as much as I wanted to like this book considering the rave reviews I had heard and read hear on Amazon I did not like the story. I don't know if I just wasn't in the right mood or what. The quality of the writing is still there and that is usually enough for me but not this time. Can we break some new ground here or tell some new stories instead of telling an alternate version of a story that all diehard Warcraft people know? This probably has something to do with the fact that this book was written by the same guy who wrote Day of the Dragon a book I liked at first but didn't like quite so much on subsequent rereads.Overall-Read it if you are a dragon fan who wants to be confused about the overall war craft timeline. There was also a time when I would buy the rest of the trilogy and make an attempt to read the books out of loyalty to the franchise that is not going to happen with there books."
1,A Pile of Poo,"This book is terrible! If you are a Warcraft fan you really do need to demand that writers do a much better job of writing fiction for your world. I am amazed that any company would allow this author to write a second book. With a potential fan base of 5,000,000, the publishers should be able to afford a good writer for this series.This is one of those books that is so bad that a reader should have the right to take the book back for a refund. Shame on any Warcraft fan who is willing to accept this kind of writing."
3,How funny,"I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKbut...I read the excerpt from the first page, and the first thing I noticed was this sentence:""The tall, forbidding palace perched atop the very edge of the mountainous cliff, overlooking so precariously the vast, black body of water below that it appeared almost ready to plummet into the latter's dark depths""I immediately noticed the author's use of the work latter's and thought it a dismal end to already poor sentence. So when I read the review here which commented on the author's use of latter's throughout the book, I laughed out loud."
2,Pleasure and pain on the sea,"A very pleasant description of sexual life, fun and murder offshore which we may all identify with. Warmly recommended as easter cosy reading or a fairy tale for older kids. The agony of adolescence well catered for."
5,"A ripping good yarn, well told","As a fulltime writer, who was spent 3 decades writing about science, tech and medicine, I always enjoy books in which there is an excellent plot line, interesting characters, and the opportunity to learn about an interesting field of endeavor. Carved in Bone delivers all three. I devoured it in a day and wished there was more."
2,Not the best that's out there,There's so much detail that the story ends up a bit watered down. Loses any intensity it could have.
4,Even though I seldom read novels ...,"It takes something special to attract me to a novel, since I'm a diehard non-fiction devotee. I admit that being a Knoxvillian is what lured me in, but it was the fascinating read that rapidly pulled me through page after page of fact-based story-line.If you're from around this area, you know immediately which county is represented by the fictional ""Cooke"". It exists, and it's real!Kudos to two brilliant writers."
1,Awful,One of the worst books I've ever read. I have a policy that if I start a book I will finish it. I almost threw out that policy. A terrible bbok that I couldn't wait to finish.
2,Joseph Haydn: Violin Concertos; Sinfonia Concertante,The songs are beautiful but he did not play the music well. I would not recommend this player.
3,Point & Click Linux,The book is excellent for those of us not technically oriented. I give it three stars because the DVD that is constantly referred to was not included.
5,A true look at a little-recognized issue,"Robert Wolley does an excellent job at taking us through the process of how to initiate, continue, and even deal with losing, love in our old age. This book is invaluable to people involved in working with a geriatric population, as well as to seniors who are looking to make a new start in the world. Like all his other books, Mr. Wolley gives us the feeling of first-hand knowledge being contributed to this book, making it more real and more applicable to our lives."
1,Too Small - Slides Out,"The product is just a little too slender so it slides right out of the phone. I'm not sure if it was just the pack that I got, or all of them in general. It's definitely not my phone. My girlfriend has the same phone and it fell out of hers too. I put a piece of scotch tape around it and now it kind of works."
1,Beware - the item shipped may not match the photo!,"If you are looking for an EXACT replacement of your lost or broken MDA stylus, you may be disappointed in this item, as I most certainly was when I received it. The item shipped was not in the same style as the photo, but instead an oem replacement with a different shaped top.The original stylus that came with the T-Mobile MDA had a slanted top that matched the curve of the bottom of the MDA smart phone, as shown in the photo. The item that I received has a different shape top that does not slant to match the curve of the MDA. You can see a photo here:HTC Stylus Pen for T-Mobile MDA (3-Pack)Although the stylus ""fits"" my MDA phone, it does not fit as snug as the original stylus. I believe that posting a photo that does not match the product is false and misleading advertising."
4,"Product Fine, Design Faulty","Several people have written how these are no good because they fall out of the phone. Hello!! Why are you buying another one? Probably because yours fell out of the phone just like mine did. These fit exactly like my original stylus. Unfortunately, HTC (who I am a BIG fan of) has a poor design. Who puts a stylus in from the bottom with such a loose fit? The tip is the only part of the stylus that catches anywhere inside the phone. Just put about three wraps of Scotch tape around the barrel and you'll survive to tell your story another day."
2,T-Mobile MDA Stylus 3 Pack,"Some time stylus slip from the hand set. When insert stylus in hand set, make sure it fit frimly, prompt delivery."
5,Ridin High Album by the Impressions,CD was in excellent condition after being changed from vinyl. I had been looking over 5 years for this music by the Impressions. They have have been one of my favorite all time groups.
2,could be better,"I got this quilt and was happy it was so soft and beautiful. I opened it up and noticed that one of the stitches was not straight and there was a small hole there. Well, ok I thougth I'll fix it, I did, it looked ok. SO into the wash machine it went and into the dryer, on medium heat setting, and when I pulled it out I was so upset! The bottom of the quilt looked like it had melted or something. I tried to fix it but it was all messed up just like plastic would look if it was put into the dryer. Also there were little bumps all over the quilt, the stuffing was just balled up all over the place. I guess if you buy this quilt never put it into the dryer! This quilt lookes good, feels nice, and its pretty warm too but its not made too well."
2,"Great show, but far from the best episodes","Where is the episode in which Squishington loses his face? Bumpy tries to get the gum from his stomach? Bumpy falls in love with the china doll? the toilet runs dry? the turkey? Molly Coddle and the thing from the trash can? the silverfish? This show had some great moments (heck, that I can remember these episodes after more than 10 years speaks to this) and if one were to choose the best 88 minutes! from the series, only two of the short episodes might included on this DVD might make the cut. To compound matters, there is no sense of flow to the episodes or an introduction to the characters for the uninitiated -- it opens with the mediocre ""Bump and Roll"" from the second season and jumps around from there."
2,"Weird, just plain weird","While this is a great idea, it is just weird. We have a baby on the way, but can't imagine that they will sit and watch this video that feels more like trying to brainwash them than teach them things about a sports team. Buy at your own risk."
5,A beautifully written book of prayers and blessings,This is a beautifully written book. Many thanks to Sirona Knight for giving the world such a wonderful collection of devotional prayers and blessings. The affirmations are really powerful too! Goddess Bless! is truly divine. I'm sure everybody will enjoy this book and want a copy on hand. I recommend Goddess Bless! to everybody.
2,They need to make a rev b.,"This is a great gun in concept, and especially at the $100 price it was a steal. But once I got the gun, all of the little bugs came out.BugsThe site rail is useless because you cant use it with a mask on. You cant get your cheek close enough to the stock to see thru it.bipodadds extra weight, and is totally useless. It is only for show and not functional in a real game.PowertubeThe assembly in the gun that allows you to fire the paintballs is made from plastic and eventually breaks, so you have to request a new one from jt every three months or so.Powertube springThe spring is made from a cheap metal so it deforms easily. Which leads to your gun being unable to recock, irregardless of how well it is greased.Stay away, it is worth the extra money to go for a bt-4 or a tippman if you want a scenario gun."
3,Too short on explanation,"This text is intended for seniors or beginning grads. The first three of seven chapters form a very quick survey of naive set theory. Since it aims at a more advanced audience, it is not as explanatory as Enderton and the exercises assume more maturity. Chapters 4 - 7 survey some advanced topics that aren't part of the usual introductory set theory course. These chapters have no exercises.The development lacks a lot in clarity, exercises have only cursory introduction, and the author tends to get ahead of himself, assuming material before introducing it. The text by Roitman is much better and is targeted at the same audience."
2,I feel a strong weakness for the book,This book is extremly hard to decipher. I feel the book is patterned after Homer's THE ODYSSEY.
2,Two-fer not up to Williams' excellent standards,"This double CD-set is not up to the usual excellence of later Williams' recordings. For one his song selectioon on the first disk is less than stellar. Williams offers up what seems to be a forced vibrato in delivering ""Baby Doll."" Songs are served up with Ray Conniff like chorus and even clapping hands. His best outing comes in ""High Upon A Mountain."" Williams improves on the second set with a superb selection of Broadway classics, ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" ""I Have Dreamed,"" ""We Kiss in the Shadow,"" among others. But even with these excellent tunes, Williams' renditions are lackluster and the arrangements are uninspired. Total music time for the set is just over 65 minutes."
2,Dissapointing for a Nickel Creek fan,"I loved Chris Thile's voice and playing on both of Nickel Creek's cds so much that I was thrilled when I heard he was putting out a solo album, ""Not All Who Wander are Lost"". While I love Chris's music and thought the cd was awesome, I was also a little dissapointed that he didn't sing on it. Finally, came ""The Deceiver"". After listening to it for the first time, all I could think about was ""This isn't the Chris Thile I know!"" No. 5, Empire Falls, is pretty much pop/rock. There's little actually on this cd that keeps it under the bluegrass title. If you like Nickel Creek's sound, or ""Not all Who Wander are Lost"", you'll be dissapointed with this cd."
2,Quilt book,This was supposed to be a new book but was clearly used. It was a gift for my mother-in-law so I was very disappointed.
2,Not very much action.....,"It started off kind of slow. Then it picked up a little. It did not have any action at all. It was very boring. It just did not intrest me. I need a book with some action. It pretty much just put me to sleep. The characters seemed very dull, the setting was dull, pretty much everything about the book was dull and boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,We love Frances!!,"I loved this book has a child and am enjoying it all over again with my children. My husband had not read it before and loves reading it to our kids, too. Frances is such a wonderful character. All of the Frances books are clever and witty; not something traditionally found in children's books. ""A Birthday for Frances"" is just as wonderful, as is ""Bread and Jam for Frances."" These books are truly a delight."
5,Very good watch,"I bought this watch for my wife she wears daily since then. It is accurate, looks good and expensive."
4,"""brightest light and your darkest fears""","Silva Screen Records presents a motion picture score/soundtrack from Debbie Wiseman - ""Lighthouse"", which is described as the brightest light and your darkest fears. The sense of timing and theme matches the film perfectly. Music is needed to set the mood or not to set the mood, the composer knows her craft. This is an illuminating and creative piece of composition, leaves nothing to chance, but to set each scene with a perfect cue. If you liked the score from ""The terminator"", this is certainly one not to be missed. Thrilling , suspenseful, dramatic and mysterious all wrapped up into one nice bundle. Thank you Silva for giving us a film score for our cravings of something original to enjoy - ""Lighthouse""!Total Time: 42:32 on 15 Tracks/ Silva Screen Records - SSD 1109 (2000)"
5,it rocks,"dude this is a killer deal. it's better than an ipod. Ihad an ipod and it wasn't worth it I returned it and got this RCA, way better, and it is a better deal, price sound, quality, and plus i hate macs or anything that has to do with them."
1,Problems!,"disclaimer: I purchased a ""refurbished"" product from internet.I received on a Monday at 6:00 p.m. and by Tuesday at the same time (1 DAY) the hard drive had already crashed and broken... something about needing a new HD System and needing to format the HD... 1 day and already this! I have to go thru some warranty company which will take a long time I assume. RCA wants nothing to do with this. This sucks. I don't recommend this product to anybody. Pay the extra money for an ipod!!!!"
2,Customer Service Woes,"I bought this unit shortly before christmas, and it was working beautifully until this week. It had an error message that I needed to reset it, in which it wouldn't. I called customer service and they were unable to get it started. They stated that I needed to send 60 bucks to oklahoma, the unit to texas, in which they would replace it with a Refurbished model. This is only 4 months old and barely used. MY whole MP3 collection is gone, and I didn't get an apology from the cust service rep. My time that I spent loading my music into itis wasted, MY money is wasted. I should have bought an IPOD."
1,RCA normal junk,This rca was bought in late December and after charging the unit for 1 day and it never indicated that it was charged. The next week the case started to swell and would only operate for 2 to 3 hours between charges. At 60 days the hard drive started to fail and at 93 days it quit. RCA customer service does not have 800 number to use for service help. This item was returned to store we purchased it at and it is our last RCA we will purchase.
2,Only 2 stars....and I'll tell you why,"I am one of Cass Elliot's biggest fans, but this collection irks me a bit. First of all, ""Different"" and ""Young Girl's Lament"" ARE NOT on this CD even though Amazon says that they are. I am tired of Cass Elliot's material being released only piecemeal on various CD's. I am also getting tired of the same name ""Dream A Little Dream Of Me"" (or some variation of that title thereof) being the title of anything about her over and over again. Once and for all, just release ALL of this late great woman's spectacular works and think of a different title to use! Also, (as even a semi fan of Cass' knows) she LOATHED the moniker of ""Mama Cass."" That name is fine if she is with the other M & P's, but individually, as a tribute to her original solo work, just use the name Cass Elliot. I am sure people wouldn't mind. The three ""Hardees"" jingles at the end of the CD are a nice rarity."
2,Warning: Cut version! Only 91 minutes!,"I can live with the awful video and audio and 4:3 format, but the dealbreaker is that this is a cut version of 91 minutes only.The description (even on the dvd-box itself) says it's the uncut version of 114 minutes, but that is not correct"
5,Great idea for a book,"This is one of the best debates I ever came across. Toynbee and Ikeda are both great scholars, but they approach historical issues from different perspectives--Toynbee from the west, and Ikeda from the east, with a more Buddhist perspective. They both have the same concerns and the similarities and differences between their philosophies makes for fascinating reading. This was a very welcome book given my intersest in the great F.S.C. Northrup's ideas, who was concerned himself with interpreting the meeting between east and west in his writings. As a result of reading Northrup, I now know that the meaning of life is that it consists of the infinitely regressive consciousness of the undifferentiated aesthetic continuum! (Yes, it's as simple as that). This book also sheds a great deal of light on the philosophical meeting of east and west. Altogether a fine book by two great scholars."
4,Works for me,"the shipping time was better then I thought. The unit was packaged well and was compleat. Installation was easy and every bolt hole matched up just right. No fighting with the regulator at all. When I was done with the install, I hit the switch and my window was working again!!! Im happy with the product as of now. Only time will tell if I have any problems down the road. Price is right, quality seems very good and fit like a champ."
5,"Weird, Not Dated","This Chrysalis album is so weird that it doesn't sound dated today. In fact, I can think of several modern indie bands that sound alot like this recording from 1967. Great unexpected song structures with funky drumming. Sounds somewhat like The Mothers of Invention.[DW]"
1,PNF was a part of old Eastern European system.,"After much experimentation on thousands of world-class athletes, the Active Isolated Stretching methods that the Wharton's have popularized is more effective and less time confusing. In addition, it requires no one else. Someday, studies will show that static and passive stretching leave an active muscle group stale. Dynamic range of motion will be better understood.PNF will no longer be viable."
4,Sports Science,Another book that explains through words but illustrates very effectively throtu a DVD show. I can now understand better the terms and the movements mentioned.
5,A Must Have!,As a massage therapist I often work with muscle injuries. This book is a must have for both therapeutic technique and for client education. I highly reccommend it.
5,"mother, daughter and the past","I'd give this more stars if I could. Oh, how the occurences of the past can haunt a person, especially a mother. Great book and a story to make an American realize how lucky we are to be free and teated humanely. This mother needs to live with the choice she made and understand that she can be kind to her daughter, it's not her fault who her father is or for her mother's past.Grab this and read it, it's excellent."
2,"Easy to set up, but no support for WPA-PSK with AES","The device seems easy enough to set up, but I returned it within hours after discovering that it does not support AES as a cipher with WPA-PSK. Even though the D-Link website claims it does, after getting bounced around their tech support line for an hour a 2nd level person told me it does not actually support that recommended that I run the less secure TKIP cipher. nice. Guess I will give the Linksys a try."
2,Shoddy sewing,"This is a nice product but on mine, the seams came apart within a couple of months. Bad enough that the shield and gloves fall out. Perhaps a bad lot? Dunno."
5,Hydraulic Modeling & GIS must have...,"Haestad Methods Advanced Water Distribution System Modeling and Management does a great job at explaining hydraulic model theory, assembly, calibration, and operational uses as they pertain to pressurized water distribution system design, analysis, operation, security, and answering `what if...' questions. Starting with a great introduction, to model creation, to calibration, to SCADA integration, and the future of hydraulic modeling as it integrates with GIS, Haestad pulls together a wealth of theory, background information, history, and real world applications for the student or engineering professional. Working for a water distribution municipality, I find myself and my colleagues repeatedly referring to and referencing both this book, and its predecessor, Water Distribution Modeling, which also sees frequent use in the office."
5,AMAZING DETERGENT,"I had used Tide for my whites and didn't think I had any issues. I kept hearing how great Persil is and decided to try it. Well, I have found a whole new shade of white! I no longer pretreat anything or add and extras to my whites! The dose that works best in my HE FL is 2 tbsp which I marked on the measuring cap. At this amount the 18 load bottle is closer to 80! So, on a per load basis it works out to be less expensive than Tide and I don't have to run extra rinses to get it out. My towels are softer due to less buildup I think. After the 2nd bottle I also noticed that my husband's older t-shirts no longer have the weird off color they would get after a while. I'm very happy with this product! Don't let the price scare you!"
1,Do not buy,"I bought one for an original NDS and they sent me one for a ds lite. Don't buy, it isn't worth it."
1,Arrived broken,"This arrived in two pieces, with the bottom 2.5 inches broken off. It was shipped by itself, encased in bubblewrap, so I'm not sure how it happened ... but be warned. It's an attractive stirrer but I don't want tiny pieces of glass to end up in my drinks so I'll be purchasing another one from a local shop."
1,Wrong description. Product is NOT for PEG-NX70V/U,"Although the description of this item indicated that it is for the PEG-NX70V/U Sony Clié, it is NOT. I tried to install it and it just erased all the data in the PDA and was not at all a replacement for the original battery. The PDA would remain with a blinking screen all the time and nothing else. I'm sending it back for a refund. I gave it 1 star because this site does not allow you to give the item a lower rating."
1,Don't waste your money,"...Please note that speaker cables are bound together and that greatly limits the the ability to place the speakers for optimal sound. Once I did set up the speakers, I found the bass wasn't all that great. I also tried hooking up the speakers to my TV set and only two the speakers produced sound. So be forewarned!"
3,American-centric Pastors' Manual,"Interesting reference book. Typical of the US Pentecostal movement though, it comes from the perspective that the world begins and ends in America. Therefore, buy if American, look elsewhere if from elsewhere in the world."
1,BEWARE! This is a TV show rip-off of the classic name.,"This is NOT the Tex Avery of the classic MGM, Warner Brothers, & Walter Lantz Cartoon fame. This is a cheap TV show, released by DIC, ripping off the classic cartoon director's name and shamelessly using it for its main character & series name.You will NOT find the classic Droopy here!You will NOT find the classic Little Red here!You will NOT find the classic City Wolf here!You will NOT find the classic Screwy Squirrel here!You will NOT find the classic Lenny & George here!You will NOT find full classic animation here!You will find yourself using this DVD as a practice target.For the real TEX AVERY experience, get these DVDs!Tex Avery's Droopy - The Complete Theatrical CollectionLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume OneLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume TwoLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume ThreeThe Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection"
5,line breeding defined!,"I purchased this book several weeks ago and spent almost 3 days digging into the details on line breeding poultry for increased egg production. line breeding of poultry and live stock is well defined and illistrated in this 1920's publication. Personally, I think it is one of the best books on the subject, the practical use of line breeding, the facts about inbreeding and outcrosses and a host of other poultry keepers secrets! I'd rate this book a 9 out of 10 only because it has a lot of repeatative information from chapter to chapter and can get confusing trying to understand the charts the breeder and writer use to describe the breeding process to achieve their goals. The key to this book is it is not just about EGG production, anyone breeding exhibition fowl or other live stock can benefit by these techniques!"
2,Not 2000 Hours. More like 500 Hours.,Lasts 2000 hours?I have gone through 12 of these so far and they only last about 5-600 hours on average.You get what you pay for I guess.
2,Full of Ideas but Not Up-To-Date,DVD on Demand is a very hot topic these days for independent film makers for distribution and sales. This book gives you lot's of ideas but is too old and outdated (2005) to give you up to date information on this power and important topic. But for the price under 5.00 it's a place to start.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"If you are looking for a resource on premortal existence, and how the belief in such is found in virtually every culture in the world - then you have to read this book! At first the book is very overwhemling, but as you get into it you see how the Carmans didn't miss a thing. I'm not sure if I've ever seen anyone cover a subject quite as in depth. Every once in a while a book comes along that you know you will refer to for years and years to come, and this is one of those books! I am happy that I found it, and it will always hold a special place in my library. Again - WELL DONE!"
1,Eroticized crap.,"I put the book down after the description of the female circumcision.I've read real life accounts of this barbaric practice and the horrors it does to a woman. But to see it eroticized, really disgusted me.Why? Because I found myself getting aroused by her word choice. She didn't just describe it being done, she gave an account of the pain, then the pleasure of the healing salve.I will not be reading any others in the series."
3,Ami learns Kinderdeutsch,"Wanting to emerse myself in the German language while on a summer exchange between college semesters I picked up a cd at the local music store that was a fun and playful album and was easy to understand compared to many other faster German language artists. It has a decent (near)techno feel to it. It is definatley aimed at the younger crowd and I recommend it to those who are possibly trying to teach their kids German. All of the songs are upbeat and full of ""sprite"" for lack of a better word. The cd also includes two videos for the pc (and Mac) which are cool, once again, for the younger crowd. I still catch myself singing in my head the catchy tunes like Kleine Satelite which has two versions, one being a remix."
4,It's a little stinky but does a great job!,"Overall I am very happy with this hair oil. Other then the complaints about the way it smells (it's not THAT bad, but it doesn't smell like roses either) I am not a fan of the bottle. The opening is too wide and it need some sort of portion control (like some salad dressing tops). Here are some details on how I use it:I have long hair with a very slight wave. I comb this into my hair and then pull it up into a sock bun. I put a turbie towel on top of that and sleep in it overnight. In the morning I wash my hair twice with shampoo and condition. I try to do this once a week. I haven't noticed my hair getting any stronger or thicker, but it is smoother. it's only been a month so hopefully I'll start noticing thicker hair eventually."
5,Love it,This product is a miracle in a bottle anyone with badly damage hair and over process please by this product you will be amazed of how much it repairs your badly damaged hair.
4,"When you invite the stranger in, you may be inviting in wisdom","There is a need for more to be written on the gift of the stranger in organizational, family, and cultural life. The stranger is often feared for many reasons. We teach our children 'not to talk to strangers.' While the importance of safety cannot be minimized, we must ask what we lose in our organizational, personal, and cultural life if we are excluding of the stranger who comes to us. By welcoing the stranger, we may be opening to new ideas, new perspectives, and new relationships."
5,Solid from the ground up.,"I wish I'd had this book a long time ago. Granted, a lot of the knowledge and practice in here is stuff you will pick up on the job-site, but probably some time after you could've used it. After a brief introduction, the author follows the construction process from foundation to roof, providing a wealth of mistake saving and even mistake correcting information. Confidence is essential to planning, executing and efficiently completing any project and this book delivers just that. It should be considered absolutely essential for those seeking to become proficient builders, whether professional or not. If I believed in employees, I'd make sure they all had a copy and I'd pay them to read it. The basics of tool selection and use, practical accuracy, and formulas are included with a lot of tips, tricks and explanations. I intend to make this book mandatory reading for my sons, it will save me a lot of time teaching, and save them a few years of correcting blunders."
4,Good for first timers,"This is good for first timers but you'll want to move past it fast. My wife used this on me with a harness and the first time, I was riding this hard. Loved it. Now, I've moved on to bigger and better things. This is still good to get warmed up though."
2,"Been there, seen that",Do not waste your money on this unless you absolutley must own every release with the name Metallica on it. The DVD is extremely short. There is nothing new here except for an extremely boring interview with James that makes the old Headbanger's Ball look like high art. A very disappointing product.
5,For the hard-core crumbs fan.,"This CD is great if you have a great understanding of what the crumbs have done in the past. It combines there style of punk and pop-punk with a rock and roll tone and flaming solos. The album does not have much commercial appeal though, and you should start listening to the crumbs with their self-titled release or the ""I fell in love with and alien girl"" 7""."
2,B run TV movies,"This collection is fair in content, considering most of them are movies taken from TV, and weekly TV movie format. I was a little disappointed in quality, don't bother watching on blu-ray, any normal player is better for video playback.I also was thinking it would be more along the lines of Turner Classic movie collection, but I was wrong about that for sure.For the price, and for the content I gave 2 stars. While you get a lot of movies, most of them are forgettable. I say five of the collection are classic, no more. However, if you consider you pay at least [...] bucks for most movies these days, there is value in this collection.Overall...an average collection, but not for the classic movie buff."
2,hollywood classics,good movies but be careful about buying more than one set of this brand. they put some from one set in another set.
5,Terrifying....,"I loved this game! Granted it was a very, very difficult game to get through but still, it was extremely enjoyable! The atmosphere and the characters in this game are much creepier than in the Resident evil series (which I also loved). Some scenes really spooked me....The graphics were excellent even for an old console. If you are an action fan, pick this one up for sure."
3,Excellent in its own right!,"I love survival horror games. It's one of the only reasons I play video games at all on consoles. Alone in the Dark 4 is one of those games that grows on you and now I can't stop playing it. I'm hooked.I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil series and I think AitD4 separates itself from RE in such a way that it is close, but not too close, evoking its own sense of fear and even loathing at some of the creatures.If you are a fan of HP Lovecraft, you will appreciate the Alone in the Dark game even more. If you haven't read, HP Lovecraft, do yourself a favor and pick up one of his books. You will find laid out before you the type of gothic horror world envisioned by a person of Lovecraft's talents and neatly woven into a game like AitD4.For survival horror fans, you will not be disappointed with this game. I have always been a fan of Infogrames and I will be forevermore."
5,Fast and accurate order,I found that this merhcant is fast and accurate with their orders and shipment. I have no issue at all with my order and the goods received are in high quality and workmanship.
4,"crunchy, catchy, and clever","This album is a pure Fender assault, with catchy hooks and clever, slightly devious lyrics (""When I see your best friend, it feels like an eaarthquake"" for example).It's like plain old loud skatepunk music, only a click smarter and funnier. I've had this CD for many years and it still gives me a grin whenever I play it.The second ""Too Slow"" on the track list is really an uncredited cover of the Circle Jerks' ""Red Tape"". It's hard to imagine but Olivelawn's cover is actually a bit faster.If you like clever, loud, aggressive guitar rock, give this one a spin. If you like Olivelawn, you should check out Fluf. It's the phoenix that rose from the ashes of Olivelawn's demise, and they rock like hell, too."
1,One of the worst yet !!!,"I'll keep it short and simple: this is as poor a recording of this venerable work as I have ever heard! John Wallace might be an adequate trumpet player technically, but his musicianship suffers incredible lapses. His (own?) cadenzas are all ego and quite ugly, his intonation frequently slips, his articulation is sloppy, and the liberties he takes with the score are trite and quite unmusical. He's even worse in this regard than Rolf Smedvig! Skip this recording and get Hakan Hardenberger's beautifully played and artfully realized version instead."
3,HOOKED AND COLLAPSED!!!,"Well, I started this self-learning course in Rumanian and I am hooked form the begining, but trapped and cannot go through at the 5th lesson, when it comes to speak about the Rumanian conjugation in Present Simple. There is no proper method for memorizing this four kind of verbs according to their ending and as the dialogues and the book is going through the estimated learning of the present to present you the other tenses, I am trapped asnd cannot pass that chapter. What should I do? I have reviewerd other chapters forward and I have observed that there is a good way for explaining the other tenses, but not the main one, the Present!"
1,Picture misled information,"I need fuse has wires at both ends as shown in the picture. Fuses I got, both don't have wires at the ends. So, they are useless to me.Small amount, I don't want spend time dealing with hassle of returning the items."
4,poker case and chips,"el poker case pesa mucho es dificil cargarlo, y viene con 1000 chips pero el case es para mas chips...1200las chips no son de 14gr, aunque son de buena calidad."
4,matsunichi photoblitz 7-inch frame,"This product made a great gift for my dad, who is now a grandpa. If the gift was meant to be for someone who's got every digital gadget in the world, or maybe someone who is really big on photography, I would go for something more expensive and higher quality..."
2,not high quality,"this picture frame didn't have very high resolution, so all the pictures look soooo pixilated. Definitely not worth the price."
1,Didn't work,"I purchased one of these frames and my sister purchased another, mine never would work and so I had to return it, my sisters worked but was very picky about how you put the memory card in ended up buying a amartparts SP72 frame, not only did it work better it also had a large internal memory and was better looking."
2,Below Expectations,"I was disappointed in this picture frame for a couple of reasons. I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift and read all the great reviews on Amazon. When I uploaded pictures to the card and viewed them on the frame they turned out pixelated and small. The photos were screen resolution and not print resolution from a professional photographer and I expected them to be looking better in a digital frame. Also, most of our photos were vertical, but there is not a way to select a vertical format for display on this frame. As a result, the vertical photos display very small on the display. The horizontal photos also don't cover the whole display. I will call customer support and see if they have any suggestions, but if not I am returning this frame. I would not recommend it to a friend. The one thing I like about it is the look of the frame itself. It does not look cheap."
4,does the job,I gave it as a gift and the picture is good. It doesn't have all the extra features but most people don't use all those anyway! She loved it and that's all that matters.
5,Worth the money,"I bought this about a month ago as a gift and have loved it. You need your own card and it plugs into the wall. Upon puting my pictures in, i had to ""play"" around with it a little to get the desired result. There are buttons on the back which allow you to choose functions and select thumbnails. I had a little trouble selecting exactly what i wanted it to do, but 10 minutes later, i had a slideshow of about 500 pictures going.THe resolution is fine, but go with a high definition picture frame if you want the highest quality. They cost about 2X more."
4,Not bad,"This clay took off most of the grime. However, the real hard portions were left. I guess I needed a a stronger abrasive clay. This was a little too mild for my black suv."
5,handy item,Great item! Makes switching ez-pass from one car to another easy. I highly recommend it. Fits my Delaware ez-pass perfectly.
5,"Works well, as intended!","Does what it is supposed to do, and does it well! The ""marks"" it leaves, as mentioned by another reviewer, are easily removed with a window cleaner and paper towel! No complaints here!"
1,Tenured Bigots,"The authors would have us believe that homosexuality should be subject to ""legal censure."" What exactly would that entail?"
1,More Right-Wing nonsense,"The fact that Jew homophobe William Kristol wrote the introduction is a dead giveaway that this book is just another attempt to defame gay people.There's really nothing new here, just the same sanctimonious malarkey from people who just can't stand the idea that two men can have a long and loving relationship (my partner and I recently celebrated our 30th monogamous anniversary together).And we know gay couples that have been partners longer than that.Sadly, many people will read this tome and nod in agreement with the author's sentiments.Hypocrites!"
5,This Book Nails Down the TRUE Fundamentals of Golf,"After playing the game for over 30 years and having had instruction from 5 of Golf Magazine's top 100 teachers, I'm impressed with John Dunigan's grasp of the TRUE fundamentals of the game. He strips away the unnecessary and scientifically unsound (unproven) jargon of many other so-called ""name"" pros and focuses on the basics - proper posture, correct pivot, precise swing plane, proper release, stable body movements, and short game technique/strategy. Great job John!"
2,Mixed Signals,"I had been looking forward to reviewing this DVD in anticipation of better understanding one of my dogs. With the price of this DVD, you would expect a better quality of video. It looked like someone's home movie. It was only 45 minutes long and trust me, it seemed longer.The one good tidbit in the whole thing was to yawn to calm down a dog. Of course my husband and I both tried that suggestion to no avail. I would not recommend this movie for anyone unless you paid less than $5.00. Very irritating music."
5,""" Calming Signals: What Your Dog Tells You ""","I was neither familiar wirh the author or her several published books. So I purchased it on a whim. Sometimes you get lucky ! Have had Shar-Pei dogs since the 1980's. Our 4th generation male just passed ,in September last, at 12 years old. Having him and his sister ,together, showed us how they communicated with each other. Then several seasons of 'The Dog Whisperer' showed us further as to 'how', 'where' and 'when' of dogs communicating. Now this book answers many of our still unanswered questions. And took us even further. Your communication will develope in to more of a two way street. And what fun it is, to see your pet 'light up'.with the recognition that they are at last being understood and can have the last word. Highly Recommended. Lee."
4,amigo standard uke,The amigo standard uke is a descent uke. It sounds great when it is in good tune. Not a bad uke probably a good choice for beginners. This was my first uke purchsed.
3,An American Style Spaghetti Western !,"First, a word of warning: if you think Texas Adios is another of those ultra-violent, stylized spaghetti westerns, you may be disappointed. On the other hand, if you like your westerns on the melodramatic side, you'll enjoy this movie. In fact, this one has a more ""classic"" feel than say ""Django"", as Franco Nero himself pointed out in an interview included on the DVD. Away from the always dependable Nero, the movie lacks a good, charismatic villain a la Gian Maria Volonte and the acting level is undistinguished. I did enjoy watching Nero in the most stylish leather trench coat this side of the Rio Grande !"
4,Crazy about Dino Squad,My son is absolutely crazy about dinosaurs. He loves all the Dino Squad movies very much. I would recommend this video to children who are wild about dinosaurs.
1,Disappointed,The book was not what I thought it was. I needed writing prompts for high school daily warmups and thought this book would help. It doesn't.
4,who doesn't love certificates?,"If you need certificates for any type of occasion, these are great. They work well in the computer printer. I imagine you could do your hand calligraphy on them as well."
2,where oh where is the widescreen version? - FOUND ONE,"UPDATE ; check outPICNIC (1955) William Holden, Kim Novak (IMPORT FOR ALL REGIONS)on amazon: this has the original, undistorted cinemascope presentation.after reading in another review that the columbia classics 2-sided widescreen / fullscreen dvd was available from borders, i checked; yes, the site shows this dvd, but they actually ship the fullscreen only, and won't refund your money. same story with fye, but they did a refund.many sites show the cover with ""columbia classics"" at the top, described as having both ws/fs; the two versions apparently share the same UPC: 043396828797, but the fullscreen only (no ""columbia classics"" on top) seems to be the only one still in production. i suspect that the ""widescreen "" side was only letterboxed, not true widescreen as most of the ws/fs dvd's that i've seen so far seem to be."
3,Purchased to compare with a new book,"We prefer the new book, When the Cross Became a Sword, by Merrill Bolender. We believe it to be most clear and concise on the subject matter."
3,Playful Activities for Powerful Presentations,"I work for a large telecommunication company. We train both technical and soft skills. This book is very ""hands on"". In other words, the games are for people that have a close relationship. There are activites that ask groups to hold hands, and give each other hugs. I know for my environment, this would not go over very well. However, if you have a close team, and want to do some teambuilding, there are some interesting activities and the author gives you some additional reading for each activity."
1,RFP Nation - author is awful,"I just listened to a seminar by the author and he sounded like an idiot or at least hopped up on drugs. He never stayed on topic and offered no useful advise on how to write better proposals. The things he did say were ""no duh"" obvious. I wouldn't give this guy a dime. 1 star is at least 5 stars too many!"
3,"promising, but falls short","The plot and storyline of this book are pretty good and there were definately times when I could not put it down but there were a few annoying details. Not enough for me NOT to recommend it, but annoying nonetheless. There is the occassional mispelling which isn't much but it interrupts the whole flow when you are at a critical point. The main character's 6 year old is a bit too precocious for my taste with lines like ""I don't mind really. I mean, eveyone knows life's not fair"" and ""sometimes I don't mean to cry but sometimes the tears just run out on their own"". Very logical and understanding for a 6 year old. I also agree with a previous reviewer that states that the main character misses obvious clues. Overall, I enjoyed it enough to finish the book but I would have enjoyed it much more had these details been different. Details are little things I know, but as any good mystery enthusiast knows..the key is most always in the details :)"
3,Wow,"That Jess Franco sure was wacky. This ultra-sexy 70's vamp flick probably arouses me more than any modern softcore film, but it's still not as good as Vampire Femmes or Vampyres. The woman here isn't really a vampire in the monster sense of the word. She's more of an energy sucker, kills by sucking sexual energy from her victims. The bad acting will get on some's nerves, and the plot is ludicrous, but if you buy this film to begin with, you can't expect Citizen Kane. A good b-movie sexfest."
3,FEMALE VAMPIRE IS CUT!,Great flick but Image has done it again. Cut the film of ahardcore scene so the can sell more copies. The print itself is so full of flaws that it's like watching a video. Did Image ever hear of REMASTERING! Don't get this watered down piece of !
5,GREAT ROCK ALBUM!,"This is probably my favorite Bloodgood album. Features the great songs ""The Presence"", She's Gone"", ""The World(keeps movin' around)"", ""What have I done?"", and the classic ""Seven"". The sonics on this album are the only problem but are easily overlooked here as this album is full of inspiration for everyone. Wish this band was back together again but I am greatful for the songs they have given us. Thanks Mike,Les, and all the rest of the band!"
5,A Fascinating History,"Highly recommended. A thorough and detailed history of atmospheric diving suit technology. Harris covers the subject chronologically, from the earliest efforts to today's JIM and NEWT suits. This study provides a great deal of information not easily obtainable elsewhere. Drawings or photographs are provided for most of the suits discussed. There are few books available on the history of diving technology. Harris has written a fine addition to that short list. A must-have for divers, as well as for anyone interested in underwater technology."
1,zero customer service,"When you have a problem expect to get ignored by customer service. Ive had this for 10 years and I have to say as a engineer this is a terrable mechanical design. Eventualy it will leak and ruin your celing in your RV. Mechanical parts are plastic. Once a small O ring fails you get a celing leak. All they had to do is make a rubber boot around the roof unit to prevent water damage.A proper designed unit is the ""Jack"" made by King industries. Im tossing this and putting up a ""Jack"" ."
1,Waste of money,It worked for a couple of months. Then LED's starting going out and not is does not work at all. Water got into the light housing and the clear plastic over the LED's is yellowed. I bought this in February and it stopped working in May. It looked great-when it worked. What a joke.
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"Followed instructions to a ""T"". Plugged all units together and plugged complete unit into my trailer plug outlet. Checked all functions. Running lights, brake lights, turn signals. All was fine so I fabricated a custom mount for the back of my motorhome. I painted the black mount white so it would match my MH. After I spent a morning getting everything mounted and looking nice, I plugged it in and retested the unit. That's when my troubles started. Running lights were fine. Brake lights were fine. Left turn signal only flashed in the 10"" center section and nothing on the left section. Right turn signal flashed in the center section and the right section was extremely dim.I tried to save a couple bucks and bought this unit but am extremely sorry I did."
4,Pet Fountain Filter,"I cannot believe I'm writing a review of the filters for my Pet Fountain...but here goes. The Pet Fountain itself is fabulous...and these filters do work and catch all the guck in the air, hair, dust, etc. to keep it working well and the water clean. My cats (and dog) love the fresh, moving water. The filters themselves? We live in the country, so there are dirt paths to the house and a lot of dust comes in and our pets are indoor/outdoor animals. The filter needs changing every month, so for a year's worth you will need 6 packages of 2 filters, but they are not expensive and do keep the Fountain working optimally."
1,Weak and [weak],"I found this book a very simple read that didn't flow naturally. While the landscape and town descriptions were adequate, the character developement and dialog was lacking. The fact the the main male character was understanding and excepting of the female character's unusual accomplishments and profession is commendable and unusual for a romance, but his lack of visible protective feelings seemed very unnatural. The plot and everybody involved fell together much to easily to make it a compelling read."
4,Great Joe Meek Productions!,"This is a great compilation of Joe Meek productions. These appear to be some of Joe's lesser known productions since it does not contain ""Telstar"" or ""Have I The Right"". If you like Joe Meek, you'll want this disc."
5,The Real Thing,"Teresas book, So Many Tears, takes the reader into the real life rollercoaster ride of the criminal justice system. With racism, corruption, deceit, love, hate, and a whirlwind of emotions wrapped into a tragic story that could easily happen to anyone at the wrong place at the wrong time. How can a person be charged with drug charges or conspiracy with $50.00 and no drugs? It can happen, it did happen. I recommend this book as it will be an eye opening experience on the hidden side of a life behind prison walls and the ones who paid the price."
2,Not good for adult bikes,"The Amazon description says ""holds up to 4 bikes of any style"" - but it really isn't suitable for adult-sized bikes. I have 2 mountain bikes (with 26"" rims) and two road bikes (with 700C wheels), and they barely fit in this rack. On the plus side, this is a sturdy, well-made rack that is ready to use right out of the box."
5,Techniques and life teachings of wilderness survival,"Great book for children and adults that Love theirkids enough, to give them simple learning skills that could come in handy, when we least expect it.I know of kid's that have already truly been saved by the lessons taught in such a way that, children remember them forever. Everyone should have a copy of this fine work in their home, because we all like the outdoors, but we never know when we might need the guiding know-how in this handbook. As willy says, ""make it back safe."""
3,not as fancy as it looks,"it is ok for playing in the house with friends and making it dirty .Nothing like the Disney costumes.The torso part is nice and lower part of the dress is made of very ""cheep-o"" fabric that starts tearing after couple of weeks(depending on wear)I don't know why all the Halloween costumes look so nice on the web and when you get them they are just.....disappointing .but my daughter loves this costume because it is pink and sparkly, that is all I can say."
5,Great toy,"...but why is the very next step up in the ladder of anal progression the A-Bomb? That thing is massive! They need to have something a little more modest but still robust.Anyway, this item is great for all day play or a trip to the job-site!Enjoy!XOXO"
5,Works well for me!,I have been using this product in combination with Lipovarin and Thyrotril and I have had excellent results. In combination with Weight Watchers I have lost 25 pounds over the summer and have lost alot of the water weight gain that plagues me. With Weight Watchers alone I lost only 5 pounds in a month. I would highly recommend this trio for weight loss.
1,What a crock!,"I've tried this medication hoping to get some results, but I didn't see anything. It was like I was taking a medication for fun without the effects intended of the ingredients!Avoid that product at all cost!!!!"
2,You get what you paid for,"The price is right for this ""mahogany""-looking piece of furniture. Quality wooden stands cost more, of course. I've got what I paid for. I bought this music stand to fit into the interior. It is not mahogany of course, and it fell apart during the assembly (I had to send it back to the seller for repair. They glued it together). Now I am just using it to keep spare music sheets. It stays in the corner of the room, and I am afraid to move it because it will fall apart again."
2,When saving a dollar is loosing two!,"I thought for sure this would be great, because how could you beat the price?!? And it's not like I'm going to be carting it around or anything as it's only holding my dvd's under the tv. Nope. Not worth it! And I'm all good with generic and not the best - but this ripped just putting the dvd's in for the first time! When removing the plastic 'tabs' I'd say 80% ripped more or less than they were supposed to. No, I did not remove them with care, because after the first few ripped I was aggravated. Noting this, I tried to be careful and when I tried to carefully remove the tabs, the sheets themselves started to stretch and rip out of the binding. So the rest were hastily removed. I have to order another because this was not enough after all, but I'm happy to be replacing it."
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this for just a few DVD's that I have backed up so I wont be using it alot. The price lets you know exactly what your getting. Its VERY cheaply made. For my purposes it will get the job done but the sleeves you put the DVDs into feel like they are made of tissue paper. If your looking for something an adult will use occasionally, this is a good product for the price. Children would destroy this in minutes though."
2,Too Big,"This item was way too big and not as described, I needed something to keep in my inner console to hold all my cds and this cd holder was way too big to do that. I returned it and purchased another cd holder."
1,Don't buy,"The sleeves are almost impossible to open,they are very flimsy and difficult to handle. Would suggest one where you can add additional sleeves if/when needed."
1,Difficult to use,The sleeves on this product are sealed and the BARELY perforated part is difficult to see and remove. If I did not have an immediate need for these items I would return them. Don't order this unless you have a lot of time to waste in actually being able to use it.
1,Underwhelmed,"Well seems people either love this disk or hate it. If you are a classical guru and can dissect music like a Ginsu Chef, this disk is for you. If you just love cool sounding classical music on kickass stereo equipment and your taste in music is ecclectic, you may be bored of the repetative (almost monotone) nature of the synth musak. Personally, I hope I can just trade this disk in for 2 dollar credit at a cd recycling store."
4,Uncommon Bach - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality TM [HD DVD DTSHD Surround Music Disc],"This recording is kind of special, the Video consist of a photo of an exotic flower, shot at close range, which changes every 10 seconds to a new flower. The audio is the Uncommon Bach music but in this one (I have the DTS Music disc of Uncommon Bach and that is uniquely an organ piece) you have different kinds of musical instruments.The audio is in DTS-HD HR. My Toshiba HD DVD cannot decode HR (High Resolution) at this time but I hope an update will enable HR, one day. But the DTS surround is quite nice.This is a very relaxing recording. When the end is reached, it automatically loops from the beginning. Can be used as a good demo to receive friends for an HD event, such as a movie."
1,Not very durable,"I purchased a mug like this for my sister many years ago and it has held up exceptionally well. I'd always loved the idea of the disappearing cat so when I saw this I had to buy it. I have followed the instructions implicitly but the picture is a decal and has been disintegrating. I don't soak the mug but anywhere a droplet clings, the writing moves or falls off. I don't own a dishwasher so that has not been the issue. I am very disappointed in this mug. I would definitely NOT buy it as a gift- your friends will think you're cheap! I'd feel happier if I hadn't paid full price for it."
1,Recieved broken,"This is an awesome mug, but when it arrived to me, with three other items, there was one layer of bubble wrap on the outside of the box and the mug itself was shattered. Maybe if the mug itself had been wrapped, it wouldnt have broke. Pretty disappointing."
2,"Clever Idea, Bad Execution","This mug would have been great if it had actually worked as promised. The 'magic' ink used to create the cat actually started to come off before the mug was even used or washed. After a year of normal use, the Cheshire Cat has disappeared for good."
2,Picture and letter washes off,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. After handwashing it approximately four times the letters and pictures have begun to peel off. We washed and dried it carefully after reading previous reviews. Great mug if you just want to look at it and not actually use it.
2,Quality control not that great.,"On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago. First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam. Very irritating, especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand. Medium size was smaller than advertised, shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use! Harbinger customer service was very helpful, and sent me out a new, larger pair for free (had to return mine first). This pair shows up, and the gloves are two different colors! Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other. Strike two for quality control! Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger. Again, Harbinger customer service is excellent, but the quality control of these gloves is less than average."
5,Candymaking,"The recipes and pictures in this book are the best I have ever seen for professional candies. Follow directions to the letter for dipping chocolate - right down to the temperature of the room. I have tried several times and the best method is to melt chocolate at lowest oven temperature (their preference too) in stoneware (metal or glass get too hot!). Then remove stoneware bowl and place on heating pad to stay warm. Then place your dipping dish (a miniature fry pan just large enough for two eggs is perfect size, don't use the cool electric skillet they recommend) right in front of you and scoop 3 or 4 handfulls of chocolate from the stoneware to dip. For cherries, the ones with stems still on are easiest, just drag them through the dipping pan. Warning! don't let too much excess chocolate drain from the cherries before sitting down or you'll end up with a little hole in the bottom and the juice will drain out!"
4,Great opening,"I agree that it is a bit strange to own a book by Manley (C.'03), then scroll down on Amazon and have it claim to be by someone else. In any case, I started at 0 when I picked up this book at my local bookstore. I must say, the opening was great. But by page 29, there seemed to be a need for clarification on the definition of bidding 1NT requiring 15-17 HCP's and the example on page 30, which was shown having 13 HCP's and still a possible 1NT bid hand. No assurance is give to the reader that an explanation is forthcoming and I have read forward a bit to see. I will now have to flag this page and come back to it later if this situation is clarified. The problem is, that the information builds on itself and it is harder to grasp new information with questions about old. Would have been nice for the author (whoever he is) to say something about this discrepancy. Still, seems readable so far."
2,Not Clear Enough,I approach bridge as a total novice. I was looking for a book that could explain the game to me. This book does a very poor job of explaining the game to a novice. The writer continuously makes reference to material that is to come later in the book. But that material is used in the earlier instructions before it is even explained.I consider myself to be a good learner. Bridge is complicated but I'm sure once I learn it I can do a much better job of explaining it to others. If you know a little about bridge already then perhaps this book would be good for you but if you're completely new to the game look elsewhere for instructions.I will buy the books for Dummies and Idiots now and hope they do a better job.
3,Half complete guide,This is a good book to use in planning what type of roof or siding that wouldsuit your project. Then buy a book how to work that particular roof orsiding.
4,The right starter book for DIY roofers,"This is the right starter book for DIY roofing folks, or those who are trying to determine if they can/should roof their own home, or if they should hire contractor instead. I read one of the other roofing ""books"" available on the Kindle, and it was not useful at all, so I was pretty happy to find this book which. While not thorough to figure out roofing without prior knowledge, it is certainly the best roofing book currently available on the Kindle (as of April 2012). If a new version of the book comes out, I hope it includes more details on the installation options for metal roofs. The steps are very good for 3-tab shingle roofs, but lacking for metal shingles in particular. If you have a Kindle, I suggest buying this book and complementing it with another roofing book in a print version. Black & Decker books are normally pretty good, and this one follows right along with their other quality books."
4,First impression,"Works as advertised & quick shipping. Time will tell if it works 'till 10,000 hours, but so far so good."
5,It is a great DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The DVD is very nice. The music is great. I bought it as a gift and my friends loved it.
1,Don't waste your money...,"Terrible as a musical toy. My daughter liked the colors, but that was pretty much it. It is difficult to squeeze the feet too. Cute as a stuffed animal."
2,"Cute, but my 14 month won't touch it.",I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust. I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me. They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself. I only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so I can't complain. At least My 3 month old likes to look at it. I would not recommend buying this toy.
3,"So, so",Works good but not the best on tough jobs. I really expected more out of this product than it delivered.
1,Don't waste your money.,Buying aMcCulloch Handheld Steam Cleaner - MC1220was a mistake and a waste of money. It failed completely to meet any of my expectations and I was never able to find anything that it would do as promised. You'd be better off with a bucket of warm water and a cloth.
5,Excellent!,"This was the very first book [in English] that I read from cover to cover. The story, the characters and the writing style was so well done and powerful that I ended up asking for more. After reading this book I haven't stopped reading. The story is so convincing that the exitement, desperation, anger, happiness and heroism are not enough...It's just a great plot."
2,Coolidge the Bore,"On my journey to read at least one biography on each president, I was not impressed by this effort. It could be that the Coolidge wasn't that dynamic, but the writing style required more concentration that I've found with other presidential biographies. Was our country better off from having Coolidge in the White House? I don't think so because he was so averse to controversy that he was inaffective. Was my study of the presidents enhanced by reading this book? I guess so, but does it have to be so painful?"
2,Disappointing.,"The machine puts out entirely to much water along with the steam. It's very wet. Also, the steam does not get very hot. I LOVE the idea of a good steamer, but this just doesn't cut it. Returned."
5,McCulloch Steam Cleaner,"We had an upright floor steamer for some time and wanted to upgrade to something with more features. Since I have gotten it we have used it for everything. I had some old wall paper that I needed to get off and it worked very well on that. It did a wonderful job on the laundry tub, shower stall, kitchen sink, floors, refrigerator and stove and finger prints on the woodwork. I guess you can use it on anything you can think of. Just be careful since it does get very hot..It is steam."
5,Fantastic steamer,This product not only works great; but it is beautifully designed. Quality materials and design. Comes with all the attachments necessary to clean anything. I love it.
4,"Cleans better, but takes longer","I bought this for my mom as a gift. She loves it. I borrowed it from her to steam off wallpaper and it's working good. As for cleaning, the trick is to constantly steam and wipe without letting it cool too much. It took me about 30 minutes just to clean soap scum off my bathtub. It didn't do anything for the dots on the bottom from old sticky bathgrips. However, my mom said it cleaned the bottom of her shower great. The best thing is once you clean, things stay cleaner a lot longer because there is no soap reside. My bathtub stayed clean for 2 weeks. This unit is easy to fill and empty. We did break the steam nozzel tip, but the company sent us a new one in 3 days. It comes with lots of parts for different types of cleaning. My only complaint is the scrubbing parts seems to wear out pretty fast."
4,"Wow, easy way to steam the dirt away","I have enjoyed using this steamer. I have steamed everything in my house. We are smokers, therefore, I cannot believe what came off my doors,window frames, fireplaces, grout, etc."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this machine to do clean my tub. I read that it would be good for removing scum and hard water stains. Certainly not ""heavy duty"". This machine wouldn't even remove the morning toothpaste in the sink! It was helpful in melting the glue to remove wallpaper, but that is about it."
2,Not worth the money or trouble,"This was my first steam machine. I primarily purchased it to do my floor grout. To get my grout clean, I first used a small brush, and it melted within a 20min. Then I just tried the reg nozzle with no attachemnts and it took hours for a few small sections. Next I tried the wire brush that comes in the kit, and that worked pretty good for a 30mins but then the main attachment itself broke in half. Next I just tried scrubbing the floors with the big scrubber/mopper, but I kept running out of steam, literally.I spent 2+ hours, and I only finished 1/4 of the grout in my kitchen not to mention the rest of my house that I never got to. I've decided to return the whole unit. It was, in my opinion, defective. Rather than try another steamer for my floors, I'll just rent one when I need it."
4,GREAT little machine-but not a 'cleaning cure-all'!,"This machine works great, just as advertised and I love it! Used it on some pretty tough projects, such as a gross 'mold' build-up on the bottom rack of a broken freezer. It worked well & removed a lot of the build-up. Its good for getting into those 'hard to reach' areas and comes with a great assortment of attachments.However...If you're looking for something to be your one & only 'cleaning solution', then this is not the machine for you. I just don't think it has the power/temp to always replace a good-old fashioned cleaning with cleaning products. But, for less than $100, its a great help.I think if you want an all-purpose steamer for VERY difficult jobs (like in a shop or something) and rigorous sanitizing ability, probably need to get one of the units costing $1000 and up.Overall, it is a great steamer and great for using around the house. So, if this is what you intend to use it for...then I definately would recommend."
3,"It's ok, not fantastic","This is my first steam cleaner, and I had very high expection for this because I read all the good reviews. However, when I clean with this steam cleaner, the stains and milduews didn't just disapear, I had to scrub hard. The only reason that I'm keeping this is I feel good about that fact that I don't use chemical to clean."
4,McCulloch MC-1275,i found that this machine worked very well. it is a little on the loud side when your in a confined space such as a bathroom but works efficiently in other areas such as the kitchen and for the barbecue. you still need a little elbow grease with some stuff like the tub or the floors but otherwise it is great for disinfecting and deodorizing. i like that it comes with a few attachments but it does not have a compartment to store them in. it was not as big as i thought it would be but thats only if you have enough room to store it. overall it is a good buy and works in many areas.
2,Wish it did more,"The steamer comes with lots of attachments so you can apply the steam in the most suitable way. The main problem is that it does not extract what it loosens up . Also, I tried it on some embedded mildew and it wasn't effective. So even though the product does what it promises, it was a pretty big disappointment and I haven't used it much"
3,jt,Would have like a 3 or 4 inch microfibre pad and wand. Am disappointed in the water dripping on other wands when cleaning high places. Good on the floors and corner areas .
1,Marion W.,I am packing it up to return. It does not have enough pressure to steam my uphostery or the grout lines on my floors.
2,I don't get it,"PROConstruction quality very goodGood lookingGot it fast from AmazonCONtakes longer to heat up the water than to just grab a rag and clean the messso loud it literally left our ears ringing for hoursnot sure what function it servesBasically I had visions of it stripping away gunk from our oven, sanitizing our floors and bathrooms and doing it all without chemicals. Instead, it is just another overhyped cleaning product that can join the long list of solutions for hard work that have been peddled to us LAZY humans since the beginning of time.Even worse - trying to send it back is insane. The box opens like a Swiss watch. There is no way I'm going to get it all back in.I can't believe how many positive reviews there are. NOTHING against this particular product, but the whole idea of steam cleaning saving time is wrong."
1,Not what I expected.,"I was disappointed by this cleaner as it can only shoot water out, not suck it back up. It is only a power washer, not a steam cleaner. You can't steam carpets or upholstery as it is no different than throwing a pan of hot water on the carpet or furniture. It is very limited in what it can do. I can clean the grout of my tile but not much else. It didn't even do a good job of cleaning the showers. I will never buy a product like this again."
2,this sucks,"This thing sucks. Just clean with your own two hands. Not only does it do a marginal job of cleaning, its LOUD. I have had this for 1 year already, and besides the first time, I haven't used it since."
2,WEAK,Put your money towards something more powerfull and hotter! I can put my hand in front of this thing. It's crap!
2,Doesn't clean well.,"I tried cleaning my vinyl floor, it didn't get much cleaner than the swiffer wet ones.I attempted to clean windows with the squeege and I spent more time wiping the windows because of all the water the steam cleaner produced.I didn't have much luck cleaning around the kitchen sink either.I also had shipping issues with Top Innovations. The original machine I received wouldn't turn on at all. It was a month before I got the replacement machine."
5,i'm happy...,"I really like this thing, in the morning I fill it, while it's heating I knock off morning dishes, its ready when I'm done. I can then blast through the kitchen and bathroom in about 10 minutes, at first I was using lots of paper towels, but then I got some microfiber cloths (I feel like a tree hugger) I'm really happy with the way it was packed too. It seems solid and well made except the brushes (they melt) (I hope by writing all this good stuff I didn't jinx myself)"
5,great product,"I absolutely love this steam cleaner! Researched every steam cleaner I could and so glad I went with this one instead of the Shark, Bissel, etc. I actually borrowed the Shark from a friend to compare and this one runs circles around the Shark. It's a lot easier to clean the floors without much effort. The Shark was so tiring, having to constantly pump it for steam, and it felt cheap. Cleaning pad that came with this steamer was a little cheap so I actually bought the pad that you use with the Shark (the square one), slipped it over the floor attachment, and it works great. Bought this steamer primarily to clean my wood and tile floors and it's fabulous there, but have used it also around the base of the toilets (thanx to 3 boys), stains on my grout, etc. and it does take a little while, but it will clean it with some patience."
5,For normal use -- just buy it,Had some qualms based on some reviews. I have used this several times by now and it works surprisingly well. Extra accessories will cost you tho'.
2,ineffective,"The videos that you might watch are highly misleading. The build quality of the unit is NOT high. It takes over 20 minutes to get powered up and over an hour to cool down. The steam is NOT hot, at 2 inches from the nozzle I had it directly on my skin and it was just warm.I thought that the power of steam would blast away the grime, it doesn't. Sorry to say chemical cleaners did the job, much faster and easier."
2,It works.....,"Steam cleaner was sent to me directly from returns. I opened the re-taped packaging to find that I was missing 2 items that are imperative to using this steam cleaner: 1)water cup for filling the reservoir 2)the funnel that allows easy pouring of the water into the reservoir. Other than that, the steam cleaner works."
4,bedbugs,"My boyfriend was having sum sum problems in his apartment. Said he had bedbugs so I went on line and goy him this steamer maybe 2 mnths ago, he hasn't complained sence. It's also good for cleaning hardwood floors, glass windows tires and more. he really likes it."
4,Nice product,I have used steamers for a long time and I was pleasantly surprised to find this one. Its sturty and easy to carry around with the wheels that are attached to it. The steamer is very powerful and I love the fact that you can steam for a long time on just one fill up.
3,Okay steamer,I've used it once and it didn't as good a job as I hoped. I tried switching brushes to see if this might help clean my shower. I wore out two of the brushes during the first cleaning. I am going to try again but on the floor and see how well it does with the grout.
2,"Great Amazon service, poor product","The McCulloch MC-1275 Heavy-Duty Steam Cleaner I received worked fine. However, it did not do the job. I did an exhaustive search on the internet to find the best machine for routine, not heavy duty, cleaner. I used the steam cleaner as per instruction including tips from users who did reviews. Over 50 years of using and working on machines from computers to gas and electric machines, repairing, upgrading, and so on, I have concluded that either McCulloch pays it's employees to do reviews of their machine or the people that like the machine and it's wonders, are imagining things. The glowing reviews are absolutely unwarranted. Other reviewers have had the same opinion as I, but there are very few of them for some strange reason.In any case, Amazon return department was great! Smooth, competent, and friendly. Many thanks to Amazon, a great marketplace."
2,other reviews and youtube videos misleading,"This item did NOT clean as advertised. For example, it has little effect on dirty grout, or even on mildew. Disappointing."
4,Great Steamer,"The steamer works great. Comes with every thing you would need to steam everything. It's got good pressure, nice long hose to mocve around. My onlu complaint I have with the unit is there are no clips or anything to wrap the cord/Hose around you have to just wind it ip and stick it over handle. If it came with something would be 5Stars."
5,Steam machine,"Great steamer ! I was very surprised it cleaned the grout on my floors to look like it was just installed. Easy to use , great accessories. I recommend the product."
4,McCulloch MC-1275,"I found that the McCulloch steamer is somewhat difficult to roll around. You have to be careful not to run it into any walls. The floor cloth attachment is too thin. I used one from another product on it that was thicker and it cleaned my floors better. It does clean blinds, baseboards, vents, grout and hard to get too places very well."
4,"Good for most household work, brushes just okay","I bought this to clean my kitchen floor tile grout, showers, etc. The steam pressure gets the job done! My grout looks *almost* new after a 3-4 years of neglect. The brush attachments are not very durable so far. I ended up using a separate scrub brush on the grout as the brush attachment couldn't stand up to the job (deformed quickly). Steams builds up fast enough (~10 minutes) and stays consistent for a very long time. I spent 4 hours on my tile and never noticed a drop off in heat or pressure. I expect to use this often."
3,Brushes break,Well... the first time I used it I went thru 3 of the little brush attachments.One broke and they all got smashed to the point where you can not use them.
3,Ok overall,"Not great for steaming shirts because it will occasionally belch up a bunch of hot water, but steaming greasy car parts, sanitizing bathrooms/kitchens, or any other heavy duty cleaning it will do pretty well. The housing is cheap plastic but if you think you'd need something like this it's worth considering."
1,Garbage,"I do not review or return items often at all, but I feel it is completely necesary with this purchase. Maybe I received a defective unit but this ""heavy-duty"" steam cleaner did little more than shoot water, make a mess, and produce luke warm steam.There were mixed reviews with all the steamers but I saw this model had a lot of postive reviews.The negative reviews were spot on, avoid this item"
1,Mc Culloch MC - 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner,We purchased this steam cleaner to go over our tile grout. According to the information on one of the tile grout web sites this machine was reported to have done a great job. I am here to tell you not to waste your money on this unit! ! ! I would not give it one star but that is the lowest I can go. We used it on several areas of tile grout and it FAILED to clean any of the areas tested. I don't mean it cleaned a little. It failed completely to remove any of the dirt from the grout. We went over the grout by hand using tooth brush and bleach and the grout cleaned up great. The reason we purchased the Mc Culloch was for the grout only. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! ! ! We used it one time and we want to find out how to return it for a refund.
4,Nice Product,"Great product for cleaning household items, we bought it for minor clean up, works great! Very portable."
4,Great steam cleaner,"Good compact steam cleaner. Gets hard to reach places, in back of toilet, etc. Great on marble floors, tile, grout and more. We were hoping would clean sautillo tile, no luck, brings up effersence. Excluding that a very handy and efficient cleaner"
3,"good steam, but.","This gives out great steam, very hot, loved it, until, the hose split, got it in may 2010, hose split, ang. 21 2010."
2,Only good for specific groups,This book is really only good for the counseling groups that are listed in the table of contents. There is really no discussion of how to conduct a group or general group exercises. I was disappointed with it.
1,Software error,"The software errors each time I try to open it and then it closes up...I uninstalled and reinstalled, still won't open. So I am sending it back..."
1,pointless,"Why would anyone buy this when you could pick up an Apocalyptica album instead? Rather than this half-assed cash-in attempt with no imagination or passion behind it, check out Apocalyptica's ""Plays Metallica By Four Cellos"" or ""Inquisition Symphony"". They do much better string versions of Metallica songs."
1,"WASTE OF MONEY, DECEITFUL DESCRIPTION","There are five movies included in this set: Deep Red, The Cat O' Nine Tails, Craze, Murder Mansion, and Scream Bloody Murder. All five movies are presented in full-screen and have been edited for content (most of the gore and all the nudity and sex are gone). With the exception of Deep Red, the running times listed on the package are for the original, uncut versions, NOT the versions contained in this set.For instance, the run time listed for The Cat O' Nine Tails is 112 minutes. The actual run-time for the version on the disk is only 88 minutes. Even the exception to the rule (Deep Red is listed and runs at 96 minutes) is an edited version. The uncut version of this film runs 127 minutes. Yeah, that's over a half-hour of gore and sex and other ""objectionable"" content removed for our safety.Oh well, what do you expect for this kind of money."
3,Too much of a tourist guide,"The technical quality is just right for this type of ""video"". It is realistic. I learned a lot, that I really don't need to know.Where is the driving ? Where were the problems, and mad cows.I have no doubt that the trip was fantastic, but the film presents it as package tour with few flaws.I'm sure that many will drool over the route and the trip, I'm still looking for the ride.Informative, technically ok, worth the money. Keep expecting the Shell commercial to crop up. I felt no tingle, or otherwise tantalizing sensation. I'm a cultural slob who considers Grateful Dead an opera performance.. I love the ride, not the history.So, this could be just what the doctor ordered for someone else. It's probably a safe present for any biker.I'm still looking for the ultimate ride."
3,Lawyers not producers,"It was a book with that gave you a good background on how film production works from a legal perspective. So you should read it if that is your concern. The authors are lawyers, not producers."
3,good product,"I should read the fine print. Usually get these cartridges in packs of two, but this only delivered one. If the price sounds too good, it usually needs checking. My bad.."
2,There are several much better choices for gun values,"This book is of little value to the serious gun buyer/seller and gives only a rough approximation of a small number of guns in the world. I strongly suggest you instead choose the 25th edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values or the 2004 edition of the Standard Catalog of Firearms. Both have much more detailed information than Gun Trader's Guide in terms of number of guns, conditions, variants, prices, and other useful reference info. The Standard Catalog also has a lot of photos, while the Blue Book has almost none. The Standard Catalog and the Blue Book are what the dealers use in pricing used guns. Either is far better than Modern Gun Values, in my opinion, and I have been a gun hobbyuist for 40+ years."
5,Melchior,"Melchior at his best! I heard a documentary about Melchior on TV one day and heard this recording of him singing ""Otello"" and was very impressed and just had to have it. I'm very please with this recording. Five Stars for it!"
3,1968 TV movie featuring Pink Floyd & Arthur Brown,"This short, black & white TV movie from 1968 makes no sense but features incidental music by Pink Floyd (with David Gilmour no Syd Barrett) and Arthur Brown lip-syncing a performance of his song ""Nightmare"" (from 'The Crazy World of Arthur Brown' album).Unfortunately, the bonus CD does not have any music from film. It's a random collection of unrelated songs:01 Paul Jones - The Committee [re-recorded, 2003] [3:55]02 Claron McFadden & The Homemade Orchestra - Here Comes The Flood [Peter Gabriel cover, 2004] [5:19]03 Colin Reily & Tim Whitehead - Bird [jazz tune, 2003] [13:48][DW]"
5,I never knew...,"I'm new to this whole style of shaving. As most men from my generation I grew up using the Gilette cartridge products along with the standard aftershave products they offer. Recently (just turned 35) I decided to treat myself and try something new. In doing so I read many recommendations for this product as an aftershave...all I can say is that I wish I had done this sooner. You need VERY little of this stuff (less than a dime size) to cover your after shave needs and it smells and feel amazing. Clean, quickly absorbing, and highly moisturizing. I'm more than pleased with this product and plan to try others within this line. The other benefit is that this bottle will last quite a long time (I've been using it for well over a month now and have barely started to break into the bottle). I'm 100% satisfied with this product. I recommend it highly to anyone that has not tried it thus far."
3,Perfect guide for a B-rated action movie,"This is a good book if you want to write a Hollywood cliché. I was looking for more depth in this book. It's really straightforward and important to read so you know how the average person views a movie, but it's really hollow. It's basically new verbiage of common sense. I'm kind of disappointed I spent $20 on this."
1,Disappointing and Sad,"At first I was impressed by the goodness of the main character. I felt hopeful. She was good to her horses, and that is very important. But then, she started telling about her lifestyle, and she was obviously in a mess. She had lived as if she did not care anything about herself. But, she was surviving, and she was good to the horses. The worst thing was what happened to the horse. It was as if all hope was lost. I was so sad. I was glad it was just a book. I just don't want to read something that is so sad, like we don't have enough to be sad about in our everyday world today. I needed a good ending, and it wasn't good, I didn't think. I am sorry I bought the book. I would not recommend it."
3,Good book,"It is a good book. Not great by any means. I was not aware it had a sad ending, so it loses lots of points with me for that reason alone. I don't like to cry when I finish a book, thank you."
4,Loved the whole horse relationship,"Particularly for horse people, and perhaps for folks facing the issues she faced, it's a well written and moving story. I'm glad I had the chance to read it and a number of my friends have also."
2,A Christian family's review,"This is a very interesting story, but as my daughter read it she disagreed with some of the morals demonstrated in the book. There are several instances of bad language. The main character had a difficult life before and after divorce. She finds new love, but it is with a married man who is himself going through hard times. She buys lingerie with the intention of having a premarital affair. My daughter is almost 17 and loves horse books, but stopped reading at chapter 11.This book is definitely not written from a Christian perspective and not for young adults."
5,"a moving, splendid memoir","I'm not a horse person. The one time I went riding, the horse took off at a gallop for mountains unknown and I was sobbing and panicked. But I do admire their beauty and grace--but not half as much as I admire the beauty and grace of this book. About a woman whose life has been banged up but not broken, it's also a moving chronicle of coming back to life, discovering what's important, and appreciating the small moments of beauty available to us. Exquisitely written, spare, and flat out magnificent."
2,Not at all as expected,"I selected this book because of the overall high reviews and because I thought it would be a ""horse"" story. But instead it was about the author's own journey in getting over fear of death and broken relationships and saying goodbye. It is a very tangled story, supposedly about rescuing a standard bred horse thad had an inoperable eye tumor. Overall, the best thing I can say about it was that it was ""different"" but I'm sorry I wasted money on it."
5,"An emotional roller coaster book , read and cry","I love horses, so naturally this title drew me in and I was hooked immediately. What Susan Richards went through and experienced is amazingly and undeniably a blessing, to her and Lay Me Down. A love story in so many ways. I cried so much I couldn't read the words and had to stop many times to collect myself, but couldn't wait to read more. Knowing how this would end was almost an overwhelming warning to stop before the end. The relationship between Susan and her horses is so beautiful, true love and devotion expressed without words. I will read again, knowing I will cry again."
2,"I should've felt more, all things considered","I bought this book thinking I'd be deeply touched, maybe transformed, as I went through a similar experience. The author did accurately describe everything on a physical & emotional level... However, with random weird exceptions, she ""told"" us what went on most of the time rather than letting us experience it; she also kept repeating obvious self-analysis of how childhood events influenced her. It didn't help that the horse didn't heal her -- it was really about the loving support of her friends, as she made clear at the end.So while I'm usually strongly affected by pet-loss stories, I reached the end of this one without coming even close to tears. My only real reaction was to calmly think that I should get the book up on a favorite swap site since I'm unlikely to read it again."
2,Very Depressing even for a horse lover,"I kept hoping for a glimmer of happiness, but this fails on all levels. If you want to be totally and helpless in a sea of depression, this is the novel for you. I am a major horse lover and the book appealled for that reason."
5,Totally wonderful!,"When I started this book, I thought it was about a woman and her horse. Just a light read, I thought. It was that and so much more. As I read, being a horsewoman myself, I was a bit put out by the explanation of horse-related words. At the end, it became so apparent to me that any woman would enjoy the emotional connection. And even cry...I had to stop reading at times because I couldn't see the page and I needed to accept what I was reading in bits and pieces. I was so disappointed when the book ended. I wanted more. To my surprise there was another book to follow, Chosen Forever: a Memoir."
5,Ya Boyy Is Just That!,"Although he is an unknown, Ya Boyy is actually an exceptional rapper. He has a style that is all his own. He doesn't try to emulate other rappers like other rappers do. He insists on doin things his way. All the music on this CD is well produced and have great dept and absent from his lyrics are scenes of intense violence that other rappers feel is necessary to sell albums. His lyrics aren't entirely clean though. He does mention things such as ""hoes"" and ""weed"". Hopefully some major label discovers the talent that is Ya Boyy and take him higher. A rapper of his skill should not go unoticed by the public. I advise all rap fans to give Ya Boyy a chance. I assure you that you will not be dissapointed. This is a Must Have CD!"
2,Unfortunately this is one of Platt's best offerings,"I am sure buried somewhere within this massive text is something really useful about COM. But, I couldn't find it. Mostly its just a bunch of dated material rehashed and renamed. Inside COM and Essential COM show the obviously flaws in this book."
4,FInished already?,"I loved this series very much. The writing is one of the best because you feel as if you are really there on the island with the island kids. Each book got better and better. Although this book was very good, I was sad when it was finished becuase it seemed to be the last one. There were things that still needed to be fixed and more detail to be added. I just hope that Katherine Applegate surprises us with two more- to clear everything up, and let us know what will happen ""tomorrow""- If you liked the other books- you have to read this one. And if you are just starting them- read them in order- they are much better that way!"
5,"Great series, but 28 should not have been the last","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series, and how the characters developed. It made me remember when I was a teenager, with all the joys and sorrows that come with growing up. However, 28 should not have been the last book. KA could have went at least to 30.Actually, I can kind of see 28 being the end of the series in a way. Though there were many questions left unanswered, some questions were answered sublminally. Aisha figured out Felicias game. Nina, Lucas, and Zoey mended their relationship. And we discovered that Claire is not an ice princess. It had the traditional everybody lived happily ever after cliche.I look forward to reading some more of KA's work."
1,Zoey Comes Home,"I'm sorry, but this book was terrible. There was no conclusiveness to it at all. This has been the most thorough destruction of characters I have ever seen. I urge everyone to stop with 8 in the series. There, all of the characters are intact and they are true to themselves. This final book is the biggest cop-out of a finale to a series I've ever read. There are way too many loose strings and dangling storylines. There is no mention of Jake, who is one of the main characters. Was he not important to the advancement of the series? What started out as a very strong series (again, read 1-8 ONLY) turned into a stereotypical mush fest. Strong characters became caricatures. Anyone who knows Claire know she wouldn't have acted in that way. Same goes for Aisha. Horrible book. Horrible, horrible book. If I could give it zero stars I would."
3,"Good, but not Great!","I to purchased this book and it is very helpful, however there was a little to much pushing towards what to purchase or ""buy me"" ads is what my husband commonly refer to them as. I would have appreciated a little more scientific facts, (not that I didn't believe what was said there just wasn't enough information for me). There is so much that could have been written and said about the subject and the book is so super thin for the price that it was kinda a let down. In short it's a nice hardy pamphlet to have but I would either share it with a friend to justify the cost or desperately try and find it used."
5,Love having the complete set,Absolutely beautiful book. Using it for Religionteaching classes. Perfect in a set of 4 with the other 3 Art Revelation books.
5,"My wife loves these, that is enough for me!","My wife finally broke down and bought a pair of these, they are simular to mine and she finds them high quality, warm and very comfortable. They take a few days to break in and stretch out to fit, but now they are perfect according to her."
4,jazz orchestration,"all selections here were written by moncur. two of them appeared back in the sixties on albums by archie shepp. moncur appeared on Frankenstein on shepp's The Way Ahead. he was absent on Sonny's Back on shepp's Yasmina, featuring archie shepp and hank mobley. both pieces are rearranged for orchestra on Exploration with a shorter play time.it's a treat hearing these tunes in an orchestral format as a contrast to the smaller group settings on the shepp recordings.and always a pleasure hearing gary bartz, who appears on Exploration."
5,"Good product, baby liked it a lot","Quality product. I make a lot of my own baby food, but I don't think I could buy organic apples and blueberries for the same price as this baby food, which makes it a good value in my opinion."
1,Stay away,"Battery does not always take a charge when it does charge it only flys for a few mins, Not worth the money!!!!!"
3,"10 Years Of Sonic, But Getting Old","All right, Sonic Sega's little mascot. Sonic is a video game character from many Sega system's (Newest One's Have Been on Dreamcast!). Not many video game charcters, however become toys. For one, this toy is small. it's legs & arms are super tiny while his head is huge! The stand it comes with isn't helpful. this toy was something I thought would be cool, but alas, no. It lost my interest the day I bought it, sadly i can't believe i wasted my money. If your a really REALLY BIg Sonic fan buy it, but if your not let your friends buy it so you can play with there's."
4,Typewriter review,Brother is a reliable maker of typewriters. Amazon's service is outstanding. Getting a typewriter is sometimes difficult now that most offices use computers exclusively.
1,Buyer be WARE....,"I bought this typewrite for my 84 year old mother. She was delighted when it arrived only to find that ALL the directions were in SPANISH!. And when she plugged it in, it made a terrible screatching sound. I tried to contact the Seller,(UNIQUE FINDZ) but they didn not respond to my emails. I do have to say that we were very please with Amazon throughout the entire process. THey refunded the price othe the typewriter and the shipping and handling involved. But I cant help but be wary about online purchases.Brother GX-6750 Daisy Wheel Electronic Typewriter"
1,Brother GX-6750 Daisy Wheel Electronic Typewriter,"This machine is horrible. It was very frustrating to operate and it does not work properly. I'm not sure if it was damaged during shipping, because the seller said that it worked perfect before it was shipped. I could not get the ribbon in easily. When changing the letter wheel, the machine would make a loud grinding sound. I was able to reset it once, to make the grinding stop. I needed to adjust it again, and then it started the grinding sound and I couldn't get it to stop. I would definately not buy this product used!"
1,Its junk,"Wanted it for my gym .but its junk , and here is why :1. cant save channel in memory2. sound quality sucks3. no reception4. earphones are very bad quality5. its ugly6. it drain batteries"
1,Too cheap to work well,"The sound is a bit distoted, radio reception is OK. But the headphone cable is too short. The most anoying is that there is now way to keep the unit from changing stations at the slightest touch, CDs and iPods have a hold switch, this item keep going ot the next station with no way to lock it to a station. Also it does not store presets."
2,"Craftsman 16"" Dovetail Fixture","My family purchased this as a gift for me. Centering of the templates is critical. I used a vernier caliper, measuring from the 90 deg. form of the metal parts holding the template to the ends of the template. I centered each template to within .001"". Also, the depth of the pockets used to set the router bit are in-accurate. They are to deep & I added shims as necessary. My advice?....Don't buy. Much better fixtures are available. Spend the extra dollars and get a dovetail fixture of better quality."
5,A quality read for your kids,"The stories in here are not just bedtime tales. This is life-enriching literature with quirky characters and poignant emotion which you will treasure for years to come. I got as much out of reading these to our son as he did, and you will all enjoy the illustrations. As with real living, the death of a beloved pet is included in one of the tales, so if your children would be upset by this, you might discuss beforehand."
4,Pretty good stuff,"I had a bad experience with Fireline the first time i used it, losing a large fall chinook on 20lb original fireline. But it was my bad. 20 was too light , and i knew little about braid knots. I have been using Spiderwire stealth every since but last year i decided to use 10 lb fireline fused for my trout rod - and i love it ! It seems the fusing prevents the braid from puffing as quick as other braids after moderate use. And it retains its color longer. The only drawback is , the black color of the smoke line can be hard to see on foggy mornings especially if you are float fishing. But after a bit of use it does turn light gray. Or you can go with the brighter yellow line.I am going to try the 30lb for a ""one does all"" steelhead set up so i can float fish and drift fish and even do a little chinook fishing with the same rod and reel setup. Looking forward to the results...but so far, on the trout rod it is perfect !"
5,excelent collection,"the tracks are the best performances of Martinelli, they are cleaned by last thecnologies and their sour are good"
5,A story about cognitive skills,"As a teacher, I am impressed with this story. A young girl faces a problem and , through her use of problem-solving skills, she solves it. And by doing so, she saves the life of a whale."
5,Wonderful sharpener,I purchased two of these sharpening rods...one for at home and one for our cottage. The rods that come with knife sets in the block are a joke and never did work properly. The DMT DS2F sharpens our knives so well that we can enjoy even tougher cuts of meat (if we have to:)). I would recommend this product highly.
2,Not for a 2-year-old (would recommend for younger),"My 2-year-old liked Rody but it was much too small for her to ride. I’m shocked by all of the positive reviews for older kids. I’d recommend this for children around one year old as long as they are coordinated enough to use this type of toy. Also, the person who wrote about the terrible smell of this toy is correct. It absolutely stinks. I returned it."
3,Fun but made of uneven rubber,"Our 2-year-old loves this toy, and we love it because it burns up some energy. She genuinely has fun on it. The unfortunate problem is the evenness of the rubber; after a few months, our Rody developed a small boil on his right butt-cheek, which got bigger and bigger over time. Now it's enormous, making poor Rody all lop-sided and unstable when the kid is on it. The rubber was obviously thinner on the right butt and tail. What a shame. Funnily enough, an acquaintance has a fake, made-in-China Rody with thicker rubber that's more evenly spread; no boil has developed, and we're now in the strange position of looking for a Chinese fake for our daughter because she misses her Rody. It could have been just our toy with the defect, we don't know."
4,good for the energetic child,"I bought two of these for my 2 year old twins because they have a lot of energy. In the winter or on rainy days, it's hard to find a good outlet for that energy so fortunatley, a friend (who is an early childhood educator) recommended these and we have been happy with these horses so far. My kids like them, and they also help build their sense of balance and even helps build a little core strength. They can also be inflated even more as the child grows. My 6 year old nephew was bouncing on one the other day with no problems. I also like the fact that these are phthlate and latex free."
5,Loving the rody,"My 2 year old loves this. Excellent quality (my eight year old has bounced on it too--of course), would certainly recommend for 18 mos and up."
5,Kids love it!,Got this for our grandson who was two at the time. Fits him great and he absolutely loves it. I can't tell you how much fun it is to watch him bounce around the house on this thing. Well made and worth every penny.
2,Okay Toy,"This toy has so many positive reviews, but my son thinks it is okay. Rody is not very steady. Because of the ball feet, Rody falls over very easily. This makes it hard for my son to bounce on it. There are better toys out there for the money."
4,Great Movie,This is along the lines of South Park. It is a very over the top and offensive film that has an underlying message. I enjoyed it because of the message but it may turn some people off. The blood and gore were well done. I enjoy actual blood and gore over the new CG stuff that is used now days. The story was a bit of a drag for me because the writing itself was not very clever. If you like zombies you will probably like this.
3,Ok zombies!,"I love zombie movies even the really bad ones that seem to make up the majority of them. I have one thing to say the front touts ""It's the best of its type since Shaun of the Dead."" BC,[...]...Not even close. There were a couple of funny moments and some cool blood gags...IE the first time I have ever seen someone go after a zombie with a weed whacker which was cool but mostly bad effects not a great story but if ya like zombies its got them."
5,Halo praise,"This graphic is awesome! Halo Jones is a well thought out girl from the mind ofAlan Moore. I read it quickly and after I finished it, I wanted to keep on reading about Halo Jones' subsequent adventures. I hope Mr. Moore revisits the Halo Universe again one day, cuz I'll be waiting."
1,A complete and utter waste of time,"One word. Bad. Two words. Very bad. Three words. Simply very bad. Four words. Don't ever read this. Ever. If you have any trace of knowledge or intelligence in your brain you will come away from reading this book feeling that you have completely wasted your time. A car wreck leaves Mandy blind and motherless, so she goes to live with her great aunt and uncle. There, in their home, she sees visions of her grandmother, Gwen. I guess this is supposed to be ""irony"", but it ends up becoming meaningless dialogue that clutters up the book and has no revelance to the topic. Zero. The book has no memorable ending and when I think of it all I remember is that I could have been doing better things. ....!"
3,Not too bad,"I bought it as a funny gadget, but wanted it to be functional as well. And functional it is :) It does the job of keeping you cool. Unfortunately it's quite noisy. Not so much the rotating blades, but the motor produces an annoying high pitched whine, which gets tiring after a while.Second drawback is that it comes with an LED light postioned in the center of the fanblade, which can't be switched off. Whenever the fan is plugged in, whether you use it or not, the LED lights up, and it's quite bright. I imagine a light like that can be handy when you're working on your notebook in a dark space, but then you'd want to aim it at your keyboard, right? Since it's primarily a fan, you're going to aim it at your face. As a result, the LED shines directly in your eyes, all the time. Rather unnecessary and annoying. I went through the trouble of disassembling the fan and disabling the LED manually. It's fine now ;)"
1,HORRIBLE - has laurel sulfate,"I am so PO... I bought this product, huge mistake since the only ingredients listed on this page are the good ones (definitely meant to misguide). To name a few, this product has laurel sulfate which is a product that causes cancer according to the Environmental Safe website."
4,I second the opinion of the other readers,"Delightful ""magical realism"" novel. Hugely entertaining.And, yes, Castillo does an excellent job of bringing to life the images of the Southwest. I grew up in Texas, and have traveled extensively through the Southwest. Castillo's book and its vibrant characters feel like ""home"" to me (even though I'm not Hispanic).Definitely a ""must-read""!!"
3,A bit disapointing...,"I absolutely LOVE Lucio Fulci, so I had to get this book. I had also heard tons about Charles Balun but had never read any of his material up to the point where I bought this book. This book is a bit of a disapointment.It seems to have been written in a hurry and is not much more than a detailed Fucli filmography which is, for the most part, a regurgitance of all the old Fucli information.This book is a descent source of information, but how much information can a 30-minute book give you? Consider it, but don't get your hopes up."
1,whatever,for what it is worth i am a machinist with over 30 years of experience and these tool do not cut quickly and are not worth the money. would be far better off purchasing a stone worth $9 at the local hardware store
5,"Great camera, no problem mon!","I live in the Caribbean and I had many other cameras before and they were all riuned by constant sand getting into the edges and zoom lenses.It takes great picture underwater and can take a banging. I carried it on my European vacation and found the wide angle very very useful in taking pictures of large monuments at close distances, eg: The Vatican. My friends had to go way down the road to get the full picture, not to mention how great it handles the freak rains that come in those cities, its an all weather camera, definetly noooo regrets."
3,Looks good but not worth the money paid!,"The I-Station 8 was new to the store were I bought it. The employee stated he had heard good things. It is okay for low volumes and a quite environment.It is slow to warm up and remote is not operational except to turn on & off. If I had to buy it again, I would choose to put some more money into the BOSE speaker setup. It provides a very attractive setup but needs some tweaks to be up to par."
3,HUH?!?,"Although the storyline is great, I found the novel to be hard to follow as it jumped from here to there. I never did find out- Why did the President hate Abel Carvajal and General Canales so much?????"
5,Excellent Book!,"This is one of my favorite maths books. My interest in it is not so much for the discussion of chaotic systems, but more for that on stochastically perturbed systems. As far as this topic goes, this is the best book I've found in the field by far. The treatment is careful and self-contained, and the proofs are clear throughout. Lots of intuition is given with each result.As a caveat, note that the approach is based on analysis in general and functional analysis in particular. If you prefer probabilistic arguments look somewhere else."
4,Short stories about cold places,"This is a series of short stories. The first one is like a fairy tale. The next two are strange. The fourth is a ""stranded in the arctic"" tale. I really liked this one. The fifth one is a mountain climbing story. I like this one, also.Because of the foreign names and words, there are a number of ""?"" question marks taking the place of letters that should have an accent, a tilde, or oomlout. (<- I know what this is, I just can't spell it and it isn't in any of my dictionaries). I've gotten used to that in other books, so I just ignore it. This was supposed to be an illustrated book, but all you get are the captions."
5,gab angel,i love almost anything that is from nora roberts have read almost alland i also love the j d robb series hope to get the latest on soon
5,WHAT I ALWAYS LOVED IN A NORA ROBERTS NOVEL,"I ALWAYS ENJOY A GOOD NORA ROBERTS NOVEL ""GABRIEL'S ANGEL"" LIVED UP TOO MY EXPECTATIONS. THERE IS NO WRITER LIKE NORA ROBERTS"
3,Predictable,"I enjoyed some of the kindness shown in the book and the vision of the cabin in the snow - but other than that it was just another romance novel, which I'm not very fond of anyway. I'm more of a Christian fiction reader - and this title caught my interest, but it there really wasn't much about God in it."
4,Easy Read,Interesting with excellent characters. Would recommend this for an easy read. Great way to pass the winter nights. Will look for more of her books
3,An OK book to kill time with.,"This is one of Nora Roberts earlier books. If you have some time to kill and are a fan of Nora Roberts, this an OK book to read. The story line is good, but I felt that the characters were developed only half way. I also felt like this book was rushed and a little on the predictable side. I've read all of her more recent book and am a big fan, but with this book, Ms. Roberts didn't deliever some of that emotional attachment you feel for some of her characters and stories. Now a little clue on what this book is about: Laura Malone has been on the run for several months and is pregnant and alone. She ends up getting snow bound with Gabriel Bradley. Gabriel wants to be left alone so that he can get his life together and heal."
3,A good read if you have nothing else,"This was a good book, and I'm glad I read it, but it definetely wasn't the best thing I've ever picked. The story starts off great, then slows down, then slows way down, then ends in a boring way. The story behind this also isn't believable at all, but for the price, it's worth the read."
3,I liked it OK,These kinds of books I find very cookie cutter. The people are interesting enough but lack the intensity that I crave in books... the story line was pretty good... but again all very predictable. It was a light read and good for what it was.
5,Great book - easy read!,"Gabriel's Angel was an easy read, hard to put down type of book. What I enjoyed was not being able to ""predict"" the ending."
1,Did not finish book,Did not like charactures or plot. Trite.Did not finish book.Not as engaging as her usual plots. Usually like her writing. Maybe the Kindle edition was abbreviated.
3,romantic but pretty lame,"a feel good book but not one of Nora's better ones. As is often the case with these, an likely setting and unlikely male characters."
4,"Soft leather, not so easy to clean",The leather upper is soft but not so robust. Waterdrops absorb before wiping. Not recommended for snow/rainy days.
5,"A great TV movie, for Civil War buffs.","This is a hard to find TV movie, except at Amazon, about the first days leading up to the Civil War from both sides views. It can't be transfered to DVD so forget that but really a good story."
2,Not good!,"If you loved Mr. Spence on television, you'll hate this book. Why? Because his contrarian insight on television, becomes much too hypocritical in print. He rails against the media's coverage of the trial (of which he was a part), accuses Chris Darden and Marcia Clarke of being more interested in their illicit affair than the trial, and of course informs us how he would have won the case. Save the coin. I've read all OJ books and the three best are Jeffrey Toobin's, Lawrence Schiller's and for something different, Domminick Dunne's."
5,Can you dig it? I knew you could!,"The 70s was one of the most interesting eras for music. There was just so much happening at that time. Although short lived, Disco definitely had musical significance, Rock music was going through a stage of experimentation. Overall the whole music scene was mesmerizing! This CD is an excellent representation of the musical phenomena that was the 70s. The CD is an excellent mix of all the different genera that topped the charts (Rock, Funk, Pop and Disco). I love me some 70s and this CD makes me want to put on my boogie shoes!"
2,a firecraker that fizzles halfway.....,"most books that fail for me start slow and never get better. Under A Wild Sky is different as it started well but turned skanky halfway through. Unlike other reviewers, I had no issue with the graphic love scenes, what was disturbing to me was when the hero finally, secretly figured out that Kal is a woman, he leaves her to be punished repeatedly, still acting as if he thinks she's a boy. The crew abuse Kal to the scene where I quit in disgust, where the crew are viciously beating her with a cat of nine tails! That is not romance-I'll try another of this author's books but I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Out of date!,"This book is simply out of date now. Having got 100% on all the practise tests in this book, I only got 66.6% on the real test. There were questions on subjects not covered by the book. A surprise? most definately"
3,Not long handle,The description said these would be long handled floss. When i received them in the mail I was quite dissapointed as they are the regular size. They should change the description... Does GUM not make long handle anymore?
5,TOTAL STRESS RELIEF!!!!!! LOVED IT!!!!!!,You can just forget your everyday life and be swept up in this truly fun thriller. No cliches and you can't predict what will happen next. Just flat out entertainment. I was surprised that mixed in with the adventure was great drama and realistic believeable characters and sequence of events. Dabbed with some romance to go along. The story is crafted so that it slowly builds up to the tremendous ending. Really original plot. A rare find and a great read!!!!5 stars!!!!!
2,First book by author,"First the good points: The plot is quite good and the characters are interesting. The book is only a bit larger than a standard paperback, but costs upwards of $[...]. The dialog in the book is more like what I would expect in a children's book (Dick and Jane"". There are numerous editorial errors that can probably be attributed to the publisher. Overall not a great first try....and too costly for the product."
2,Just take the picture!,"I bought this camera several years ago and was extremely frustrated with it. The zoom part is great, and the pictures, when I could get them, looked fine. What I hated was that the camera wouldn't always take a picture when I wanted it to. Probably my pictures weren't perfectly focused, didn't have the best lighting, etc., but I was hoping for spontaneity and instead got a camera that argued with me. I like to snap pictures a bit before people are expecting it, so they don't get those frozen smiles. With this camera, I often had to push the button one, two, three, four, five, sometimes six or more times before it finally took the picture, guaranteeing that my subjects were as artificial and annoyed as possible. I tried every different setting but still had the same problem. Many cute pictures of my small children were lost forever because of this camera. I contacted Canon but they offered me no help whatsoever. I will never buy a Canon again!"
2,unexpected,"was looking for simplier way of using the database capability of Access into the charting strengths of Excel by integrating the two packages - all without VBA. Unfortunately, there was too much VBA for my taste."
1,A wordy collection of Excel code,"The title of this book is misleading. 70% of the book covers Excel and how to make Excel integrate into other platforms and applications. At 190 pages, that means the author spends about 60 pages covering Access (and that's only to cover intuitive tasks accomplished through the user interface). The examples are mostly Excel VBA code; none of which are particularly new or mind blowing.The strangest part of this book is the author inexplicably puts a half-hearted Excel object model in an Appendix. But no object model for Access? Can anyone say filler? Seems a shame to waste such an interesting topic on this extremely wordy collection of Excel code. The positive: this book is thin enough to fit perfectly under my wobbly desk."
2,Olympus Stylus 770SW - Silocone skin shedding,"I purchased this accessory package specifically for the extra battery and the blue silicone skin to protect the camera... I only needed the extra battery once, as athe battery life on this camera from the factory is excellent.. the blue silicone skin (Olympus barnded accessory) tore the first time I put it on..... bummer.... the tear was at the mold seam.... great protection for the camera, but be ever so careful when to put it on and take it off!"
4,"Great Book, a little outdated","This is a fantastic network programming book both as a learning tool and a reference tool. It's easy to follow and easy to read. The only problem that I have is that this is pre-ANSI C, meaning that functions will look weird to people who are more used to ANSI C."
3,"beautiful shoes, if uncomfortable","The shoes are very beautiful, especially if you're wearing a long, formal dress or dressy pants. The jeweled toes peek out perfectly and look great!However, the front of the shoe (the part you slip your toes into) is *very* narrow. I have narrow feet, but these pinched and partially cut off my circulation! They are also very, very slippery, so be sure to scuff the bottoms or buy stick-on traction pads. Wear these shoes in before taking them anywhere important.All in all, the shoes are very nice and look fantastic, but I would not buy them again at this price."
4,God's healing hand,"It is ironic how many people try to use science to disprove a healing God. Meanwhile, this book uses science quite eloquently and articulately to demonstrate the healing power of God. ""Faith Factor"" is a good longitudinal review of the literature linking faith and health. Although Mathews is a Christian, he tries desperately (and I believe successfully) to keep his own faith from biasing the book by examining how faith in any religion seems to improve health."
5,Love the Halston Z-14,This is my favorite cologne for my husband. I was glad when he actually asked for more. Got a good product and great price.
1,I'll never buy another Sony product,"I have a Sony digital camera that had a manufacturers defect. I called in when my camera quit working but they couldn't even tell me what it would cost to look at my camera. A year later I decided to do some research to see if there were any recalls. Sure enough there were. I sent my camera in to be repaired (free) and got it back still not working. When I called they wanted me to send it in again. I told them I am planning to buy a higher mp camera and really would rather pay for an upgrade or something. I don't want the same broken camera back. No dice. So at this point, even though I have invested in memory for Sony, I will buy a different brand. Sony doesn't have great service or integrity. Just be careful."
5,Very attractive ear cuff,"I love this little ear cuff. It is just the right size and shape. It fits great and looks delicate. I used to have piercings in my upper ears but they would always get infected, this is the perfect alternative. Next, I am going to get the spiral earrings this company sells--they are beautful. This arrived fast--in fact, I think it was the first thing to arrive out of an order of 30 products. I am very pleased."
5,DMT Crystal Saver,Very happy with the product. Careful filing repaired and smoothed sharp knicks on fine crystal.Use lots of water to build up a paste.
1,Have tried two of these and neither work at all,"My old battery wasn't holding a charge very long so I ordered one of these to replace it. The new battery wouldn't charge at all, even when left on the OEM charger overnight. The old battery did charge so I knew the charger was OK. I ordered a replacement via Amazon and the 2nd battery wouldn't charge either. My attempts to contact the manufacturer went unanswered."
5,Cadillac Compressor,"While not cheap, Thomas' oilless compressors are the gold standard. We have used several of them since 1997, and are on our second of this twin cylinder model. The twin cylinder model is quiet and powerful, and we have run them continuously with significant duty cycle for days at a time. They don't last forever, but Thomas' customer service is excellent and will help you keep it going if something fails and are capable of doing the repairs yourself (we haven't used service centers). If you are a heavy duty user, like us, I highly recommend it."
3,Not a bad buy,"Over all, this is not a bad buy. I was disappointed that it started to show scratch marks so quickly (within the first week). It will be replaced for a wedding ring but I'm still glad I bought it and will continue to wear it."
5,So far a good buy,"I was surprised with the shipping and how fast it arrived. Very nice ring. I haven't found any reason, so far, to not like it. It's lightweight and simple, a very good buy for the price."
3,Hubby's Band,"Cute ring I brought it for my husband. Darker than the photo shown ring actually looks Grey (tarnished). A little disappointed, but you get what you pay for."
4,Decent Collection of Southern Drums,"Pretty nice compilation of powwow music put out by the Gathering of Nations. This volume focuses in on southern style drums (which, if your unfamilar with powwow music sound quite different from the northern drums). This album features some of the greatest drums, like Sizzortail, Rose Hill, Young Bird, Cedar Tree, Zotigh, Southern Boys and the Cozad family. Overall its a pretty nice compilation. Not a great CD, which is hardly suprising, but still a pretty decent fix if you want some powwow music to listen to.If you want more authentic powwow music, your best bet is still to go to a powwow and look around for some tapes. The Hinckley tape is a good southern drum compilation, as are tapes from most of the artists on this CD. Still, its a definate jumping place, especially for those who have never been to a powwow before or who haven't heard southern drums."
5,Completely Daft,"The Cineverse cycle is an act of pure genius, it remains fast and fun whilst steering clear of any particular subject at all. If you found the Teletubbies/Tweenies funny yet scary this is the book for you. This book could easily be made in to a cartoon, as is brilliantly illustrated by Josh Kirby on the books front cover. I would say that this is a special book and is great reading material for a younger child entering the vast world of teenage and aldult literature."
2,I just can't see it,"I got this book in a boxed set of Roald Dahl's books. While I loved Matilda and *liked* The Witches, I found this book almost, well, comepletely stupid. Mr. Hoppy has loved his neigbor Ms. Silver for a very long time, but has never summond up the courage to tell her his feelings. One day while they were having a chat, Ms. Silver mentions that she worries about her much loved tortises size. So Mr.Silver comes up with a ridiculous plan to make it look the it had grown, then before you know it, they're married. I read this book in about twenty minutes, and i can never see how this can be depictied as a novel. The story was absolutely just plain stupid! This was written for younger audiences, I kept that in mind, but I dont think it's the kind of story children would like, there's no point to it! NOT reccomended."
2,Small in size and quality...,"We're in the process of returning our little elph friend. It was really cool at first and everyone loved the compact size. (We kind of showed it off a little at a couple of parties.) But after a recent trip to Disneyworld, we were comparing our photos to ones we took a couple of years ago with a 35mm camera and the quality of the elph is pretty bad. (I even met someone at Disneyworld who also had an elph. When I asked her how she liked it she said the quality isn't all that great but it's small.) I think if you're deciding between having nothing and a small APS, then at least you got the shot, otherwise, why sacrifice the quality of an important picture?"
1,Looks Cool But...,"I have had this camera for a year and I am going back to 35mm. Initially I thought this camera was so cool because it is really small and lightweight. I took it with me everywhere. As I started getting my film developed I was surprised that the picture quality wasn't that good but I figured it was just my amateur phography skills. However as time went on I realized it was the camers itself. Also some other problems I have had include the red-eye reduction - it doesn't work, every picture that comes back has red eye (and I do means EVERY picture) Also, all my pictures come out as wide angle even if I set it on 4 x 6 prints. I have contacted Canon and they want me to ship the camera to one of their service centers so they can check it out. I think I have to pay for the shipping so I might just cut my losses and chuck it in the trash. If you are looking for a great camera go elsewhere."
2,Not for beginners,"Despite all the 5 Star reviews, this DVD is not for beginners of QiGong, unless you want a lot of history. If you are looking for a DVD with QiGong excersizes for everyday, this is not it."
3,This is not a high quality recording,"The participants are truly great people; but, this is not an original, high quality recording and is irritating to listen to. In all fairness, the write up on this informs you that it is taken from the original and that should be a clue that its not top quality audio."
3,Okay but not great,"The stamps included with this set are of good quality and work pretty well. It's a fairly limited set, I think, in that the symbols included seem sort of randomly selected, and a few of them (a straight line, a circle, a square) are really only useful in conjunction with other stamps. The booklet included with the set is silly and seems to be aimed at teens (it goes on at length about ""white witchcraft"" and how to do things such as ""draw down the moon"" on paper with your stamps), and the ink pad was of poor quality and crumbled the first time I used it. I paid $5 for my set (from a discount bookstore in an outlet mall), and I think $5 was about the right price. I would have been sorely disappointed if I had paid $20 for this set."
5,Excellent item,This is a convenient little sharpener. Easy to keep in your pack or in a drawer. It does exactly what you would expect out of a coarse sharpener. Worth the price.
3,Interesting but not fantastic,"I bought this CD out of whim. There are some interesting takes on Beyonce's material like ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Baby Boy"". But nothing to shout about. 3-stars !"
1,Not a good value,"I don't know how anyone could think this is a good value. The processor is several years old and the speed is extremely slow. A 4.5 gb hard drive will hardly hold anything any more. I would estimate the value of this laptop at somewhere in the area fo $75 to $100, and I think I might be being a little generous."
4,good unsigned band,"The writing is very good, the musicianship is excellent and Palmer's vocal's have enough character to keep it all together. It's like John Hiatt or Steve Earle meets the old version of the Outlaws. The production is a bit primary, but I like that ""garage"" sound. Worth the ticket price."
3,Needs better suggestions,"She uses lots of bible verses to make her case that women aren't required to ""obey"" a spouse that is violent or cheating. She also states you need to confront your spouse about their behavior. For a spouse that's violent I can certainly understand not wanting to confront them! Personally, I think it would be best brought up in therapy and if a spouse is unwilling to go, I would try a letter they could read while you're out so they cannot immediately react (possibly) violently."
3,its okay,well the sharpener is a little chintzy. but it does sharpen so i guess you get what you pay for.
1,Don't Judge this Camera By Its Look or Its Name,"This is quite possibly the worst camera that I have purchased. I was expecting much more than what I received in the mail. The camera does have a 80mm zoom, however, you only get two choices 38mm or 80mm, nothing in between. Lacking on bells and whistles. This camera arrived in the mail today and it is going back in the return mail tomorrow. Cannon quality, I don't think so."
4,Good for teaching about the winter,"This book teaches a nice lesson about hibernating... animals like squirrels and bears come out one at a time until all the sleeping animals are awake to see the first signs of spring. It has great illustrations to help kindergarten-age children understand how the animals hide in different places from the snow. But it was nothing special, to be honest. No real story. Rent from the library and buy one of Ruth Krauss' other gems."
2,this book will NOT prevent you from getting busted,"this book tells you the law as it is written. but it's a drug war kiddies it's not fair it's not ment to be. i read it cover to cover this may be the law but it's not the way the police work. follow this book you'll get busted and you wont know how to get out of it.be wise and buy ""busted"" by chris fabricant.one thing that is a good example. this book makes it seem as if it's hard for police to get a serch warrant. for one a cop needs about 35 seconds to get one. and two thay usally do not need one. if a cop sees marijuana on your table threw your house window he needs a warrant to enter. light it up and it's destuction of evidence and he can break down your door no warrant needed.buy busted read it and stay safe till it's legal."
1,Pointless . . . Move On,"This books is too broad in scope. I love the ""Dummies"" books, however this one misses its many marks. Until you see ""Pot Limit Texas Hold'em for Dummies"" or ""9/6 Jacks or Better for Dummies"", I'd pass on this one and find any of the other well written books that pertain to the certain subject for which you are looking."
4,A German Legend,"This book contained some great things if you collect Walther firearms:vivid color photographs,biographical details about the Walther family and the history of their industrial dynasty, interesting insights into the development of each model, and prototypes of pistols that never made it to the production line.Even though the book comprised nearly 400 pages,I read it and then felt more could have been told--something was left out.Things I wish were there: an index, a table of serial numbers reflecting production dates,explainations of various markings on Walther guns.Belongs on the firearms enthusiast's bookshelf next to the Colt and Ruger books by R.L. Wilson.Better than the Walther handgun book by Gene Gangarosa."
3,Good but no subtitles,I am annoyed that after owning several BBC/BBCA dvds that this one does not include subtitles or closed captioning in any language.
5,Completely hillarious!,I saw The Taming of The Shrew when BBC America aired it and loved it. I am so glad that it's been put on DVD. What a great way to put a new twist on an old favorite.
5,Got it for my dad; he LOVES it!,"My dad told me he wanted THIS EXACT SHARPENER for Christmas; so of course I got it for him. He wanted ONE sharpener for ALL his kitchen knives, smooth edged and serrated, his Swiss Army pocket knife, and anything else he could find to sharpen... maybe his chainsaw and lawn mower too, I don't know. Now when I visit him, his knives are perfectly sharpened. He likes the fine grit as opposed to the very fine or medium, and he loves how it opens and closes, and how it handles when open and in use. I wouldn't be surprised if he sleeps with it. He actually let me use it once (oooooh!) to sharpen a big, fancy Spiderco knife I have, and it's just as perfect as he says it is. Maybe I'll make him buy me one for Christmas this year."
3,Does work but hard to use,"Although this item looks simple it is difficult to use. Without any sort of guide it is difficult to hold the knife or sharpener at the correct angle. I actually ended up ruining several knives. Would recommed it because of the price and to MAINTAIN an edge, not resharpe one."
4,I am very impressed with this camera,"We have had this camera lying around our office for over a year for taking jobsite photos. When our son was born, I asked my husband to bring it since it had a zoom feature. We took a roll of black and white, and every single shot is perfect. I used it again to take another roll of the baby and some shots of our vacation, and again, every shot is perfect. I am really pleased with this camera- at least with black and white film, it can help you get really good, art-quality photos. I use the zoom for almost every shot and compose my pictures carefully.We have had this camera out on construction jobsites, and it's been bouncing around in carry-on luggage and my diaper bag, and it still works perfectly.I think this is a great camera for the money- I had all but given up on taking photos- they always came out so badly- until I started taking black and white pictures with this camera."
1,Buy something else!,"Had my SureShot for a year, now I have an H on the screen. Does not work, once in a while I can get it off but the Zoom does not work. Garbage!"
4,Buz Thrills!,"I use this book to help teach Pre-K & Kindergarten students medicine safety. They are thrilled with the setting (inside a boy's mouth, eye and ear). They stare at the illustrations with wonderment and delight. Just a fun, fun book."
3,So-so,"I bought the model which also has date printing(but is about $10 more). This camera is pretty decent, but I think that it is a bit expensive considering there is no zoom, or date printing. I definitely recommend Sureshot Owl Date camera model. Keep in mind that this camera is for the most basic of camera users. The larger viewfinder is definitely a neat idea. See my review for the date camera."
3,Nice protection for your Sansa E250,"I like this small cage. It is Made of a soft material to avoid scratchs. 4 Stars because do not protect your Sansa E250 screen. Anyways, it is cheap and I recomend the gray because it fits with the rest of the device. If You use this cage you can not use the original soft little bag that comes with the mp3. Just so you know!"
3,good and bad,"The case fits like a charm but there is no screen protector and because its silicone, everything is sticking to it and is hard to remove those bits of stuff."
4,Good item,This works perfectly in protecting my sansa. It fits like a glove and has kept my sansa in great condition. The only thing I have a problem with is that it attracts dust and dirt. It's easy enough to wipe off so I'm ok with it. Recommended product.
2,Find a Better One,"I bought this to keep the Sansa from getting banged up. Since this is the reason I purchased the product, I'll give it 2 stars. That is about all it does. Other reviewers have covered the other shortfalls- static build up, covering controls, etc. I was lucky to get mine for a really low price, or I'd be more disappointed. Spend a couple bucks more and get a better case, I know I'm going to."
2,Its alright i guess,When i first got my sansa in july it was about the only thing around so i had to get it. Its an alright case but theres no screen protection or armband or belt clip atachment. i would say invest 5 more dollars into a better product.
5,Back on track,"After an overall decent but mildly disappointing ""Everything You Need"" in 2003, it's apparent that Slightly Stoopid have been keeping themselves busy since then, on tour almost non-stop, while still finding time to write and record their best album to date. While lacking in the familiar brand of Slightly Stoopid's punk rock, the album doesn't fall short on fusing reggae, hip hop, and other genres into a lush blend of musical viagra. Great musicianship, interesting stylistic themes, and a magnificent guest spot by Barrington Levy make this one of the most versatile reggae albums this side of the 21st century."
3,Good for begginners...,"All jokes aside, but I am waaay too and experienced for much of what is discussed in this set to matter or show me anything new or useful. It would be better for a young couple to view and learn from, however it is more than useful to just about anyoneif for nothing else than as a background arousal tool during sex. If you see porn like I do, as being too harsh and misogynistic, then this is porn's vanilla, softer, and female-friendly country cousin..."
4,Good info,"Very good info. Very well done. Great tips, advise, suggestions, positions. The actors are real couples so don't expect real beautiful people. Overall, I believe you will definitely learn something from this series."
5,perfect for small space,"I just recently bought this system for my DELL Notebook and took it back with me to my company in the Czech Republic. I was surprised at how well the speakers work for what I need it for. I have a very small office and the sound and bass is perfect for whatI need. The subwoofer is under my desk and works and sounds great, as well are the 2 smaller speakers that are above my head on each end of a bookcase. For a small office I this unit works great. If you are looking for something that is going to ""ROCK"" the floor, or ""Shake"" the walls, then this isn't something for you. But for my purposes, I am very satisfied with the output and the price I paid for it. I would have expected to pay more for such an item. Brad"
1,This Bud's Not for You,"Some of the criticisms aimed at this film are well deserved but not well delineated.This is a great deal like Dudley Moore's ""Arthur"", with Kevin Costner doing a Larry-the-Cable-Guy schtick for the entire film. What galled me most, of course, was the pathetic waste of talent. Kelsey Grammer and Nathan Lane in the same film as Dennis Hopper? And NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS FUNNY FOR EVEN A SECOND?I'd say skip this rancid snore and invest in ""Recount"" with Kevin Spacey."
2,Something to do while eating popcorn,"What has happened to Kevin Costner? Since Bull Durham and Dances With Wolves it's been a looooong slide downhill. There are a few good points in the flic: we all should vote, politicians mostly are unethical, kids taking care of parents is funny,sad or cute, but there's nothing else here."
2,Frustrating,"An idea that maintains the propensity to be great, spoils away with no resolve. The main characters are extreme, the story twists are unreasonable, and the ending is... well, there is no ending. I found myself laughing here and there, but clever dialogue didn't make up for the lack of closure. Overall, poorly written."
4,Great Movie,Gives you a situation into what politicians would do to win your vote. Great use as a instruction tool on how this could never happen in our country compared to the process that is in place.
5,Tent pole fixed,"Original shock cord just failed, too soon I'd say, so I replaced it with this. Works great!"
4,needs a longer chain :),"i got this for mothers day, it is very beautiful but for those people who don't like to be choked by their necklace i suggest you invest in a longer chain to go with it. Other than that i have no complaints. :)"
5,I believe you have my Stapler,I was told I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume between the hours of 9 and 11.
5,Perfect addition to the Office Space at work!,"To the uninitiated masses it's just another high quality stapler with a nice paint job, but to the truly enlightened, it's an icon!We have our own Milton Waddams, so this stapler was an Office Space ""must have""...(I'm not sure we even have any staples for it...eh)Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler..."
2,Enjoyed it while it lasted...,"Heavy stapler but with, I think, weak ""internals"".It failed on me after 3 months of usage at the office.Time to move on."
4,"Great stapler, but Swingline 444 is a better value.","I suppose many people would consider me a stapler geek. I use them extensively to organize at work. I even use the pin feature.I have Swingline 747 (older all metal USA version) and although it's a great stapler, I consider the Swingline 444 to be it's equal. The 444 is a heavier duty version and suprisingly, less expensive.My favorite staplers? Either my Bostich B12G Spartan or my Bates 56, both from the 60's...Both still see daily use...."
5,Excellent stapler!,"This stapler is well worth the price. It functions smoothly, much more so than another ergonomic stapler I have used for a long time. Its red color is eye-catching and will be a great college discussion piece this fall. It automatically brightens the desk at my summer job as well! The red is a little more orange-hued than I would have thought, but it is attractive nevertheless. The rubber bottom really DOES work as well. Great shipping time and the best price I could find on the web.Overall, a great buy!"
3,Not the stapler in the movie.....,"It's a solid stapler. But the color is more salmon than red. And, the Swingline logo is on top on a metal plate instead of stenciled in white paint on the side. This is not the stapler in the movie Office Space. Future buyers beware."
2,Made In ??,Everything was good till I saw Made in China under it. I think this limited edition should be produced in the USA
4,Great if you're a fan,"Action is smooth; works great. Looks awesome. A little heavy, but who gives a rip? ""Excuse me...I believe you have my stapler?"""
2,Buy it used,"I was entertained by the clever one-liners throughout. However, this book is not as described on the back cover. I feel very sorry for any bride-to-be, or woman-in-general for that matter, who can relate to the main character.Anyone who ever ponders the reason divorce rates are so high should read this book."
3,easy vacation read,"A nice read, humorous portrayl of the insecurites and doubts that go along with relationships. The book reads like a diary however, choppy with it's fragmented plot. Obviously meant to be humorous, not deep, but worth the read if you have a few hours to kill."
4,a laugh-out-loud narrative many women can relate to!,"Some readers may not like this book because it is so honest! ....Otherwise Engaged presents a witty summary of one woman's experience as she journeys toward the alter. Her story includes not only the sweet, romantic moments, but the more irritating, every day events that make one stop and wonder ""do I really want to marry HIM?"" This kind of questioning is the way Eve prepares herself for marriage. Eve comes to realize, along with her readers, that marriage requires the acceptance of both the cute AND annoying things one's fiance does! That's just a reality, and the author does a wonderful job of illustrating it. The question is...can you live with those idiosyncracies ""for the rest of your life?"""
4,Witty Wow,"I laughed out-loud reading this book. Finnamore's wit is wry, caustic, and, at times, dead on. Eve, our heroine, whines a bit much; even though her whining is part of the comedy of the book it does grate after a while. Other than that, a good read. Morbid and funny."
1,Sadly Over-rated,This book is certainly a silly and overbearing account of a woman's lonely view of a desperate world. There was no reason to spend any time with a character like this.
1,Not for me,"Aside from the fact that the writing of this book was bad, this story was not something a well-educated woman would appreciate. It's too geared toward the type of woman who feels she needs a man, any man, to survive. There were a few funny things here and there, but The desperation and tone of this book turned me off within the first couple of chapters."
5,Perfect book to make you laugh at yourself !,I really didn't watnt his book to end- the first time in a long time that I have laughed out loud at a book. It captures the silliness and honesty in us all.
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,"I can't understand why there are so many harsh reviews of this book. I may not agree with the main character's behavior or beliefs, but found this book so entertaining. The author has a biting wit and has a bunch of great one-liners. Some parts of the book dragged on, but was a great weekend read."
1,Superfluous & Vapid,I was utterly disappointed and occupied by constant urges to throw this trite work in the trash. I was captivated by the synopsis (bravo to the book jacket copywriters) but spiraled into deeper and deeper shock as I read page after page of stop and go paragraphs. Ms. Finnamore found it imperative that she pack a punch in the final sentence of EVERY SINGLE paragraph. This was distracting and made me intensely upset. I stopped reading the last sentence of each paragraph which lifted the dread a bit. 1/10 as witty as the TV Guide and only half as enlightening. Avoid at all costs. The only character that was real was Graham and the only moment that felt genuine was when they all discussed sleeping habits. Contrived and superficial. YUCK!
5,This book rocks!,"Suzanne Finnamore really gets to the heart of romance and relationships in this book. Her honest, devastatingly sharp-witted and very quotable novel is difficult to put down. Read it on the beach, read it on the subway, read it in a hot bubblebath, but definitely don't miss this one!"
3,Not what I expected,"I thought the book would be funnier than it was. I wished that I would have bought it used at Amazon rather than new in the bookstore.There are a few LOL moments, but you wonder why Eve is even going to marry Michael? Right up until the end as she is walking down the ailse, she is comparing her experience to what death must feel like.The funny parts include what we women think and experience before tying the knot: ""What if you get married and you hate it? What if you have an affair? Would he leave you, or would you stay together? What if he has an affair? What if he goes bald?""The story is a little jumpy and not focused at all."
3,Not all that after all.,"Aside from a handful of passages, I really didn't find all that much humor in this. Just a story about a woman getting married and her reflections on her life as it once was and projections on how it will be after marriage - if in fact she can ever get up the courage to go through with it. A quick read and sometimes funny but not hilarious and not terribly insightful either."
4,something different and refreshing,"""Otherwise Engaged"" was a smash hit! I loved Eve's take on the trials and tribulations of deciding whether to take the plunge or not....it's almost like a diary of sorts...she relives her whole engagement up until the day of the wedding."
4,Definitely worth the price.,"This book is written in a breezy style, yet contains enough varied information about the world of short films to make it well worth the price. I liked some of the ""top ten"" lists, such as great shorts to see, and tips for getting great performances from actors. This is not in-depth stuff, but the value of a book like this is that you can read it quickly and be reminded of a great number of essential things otherwise forgotten...or never learned."
2,"Chintzy, passable for a cheap band","I bought two of these to replace the bands on two of my wife's watches. The first thing I noticed is that they are adequately substantial, but the black surface is very thin. As I installed the bands, the exterior skin cracked with the bending required, showing the white material beneath. Also, the springs that hold the bands to the watch are not high quality. Of the four springs I used, one of them did not re-extend once it was compressed. I will post a pic if Amazon allows this. The non-expanding spring was basically useless, and I had to use the spring that had been on the previous band. For an everyday watch that you don't care too much about its appearance, it's a relatively good value. However, if I were doing this again I would pay a little more and get higher quality."
3,It serve's it's purpose,"This band is a little stiff and it runs a little small. I have small wrists and it barely fits. Otherwise, it fit the watch perfeclty and keeps it strapped to my wrist, so it works."
4,Charming 4 1/2 stars book,"I would have given this 5 stars except that the beginning was slow, and I almost put the book aside and stop reading it. But since I read Ms. Boyle's latest book and loved it, I figured I would try to read at least 100 pages before tossing it aside, and the next thing I knew I was so caught up in the story, I couldn't put it down! Give the book a chance, it is a charming read!"
4,Not a hard workout but it keeps you moving,This is a great video for working on your grace and working up some sweat with great movement. I didn't get bored at all :)
3,Too Much time and not enough sweat,"I found this very enjoyable. The video is almost an hour long and includes dynamic stretching, ""floor barre,"" low-impact cardio dance movements, and a cool down. This is definitely a workout for the masses, not just dancers or ballerinas or pilates gurus. If anything, this disc errs on the side of too much cardio and not enough dance. The core movements around which the routines are centered are very bouncy and not very balletic. Also, the hour-long run time hurt more than helped the workout, it could have easily been condensed."
4,everything you needed to know in 1972 ;),"I love this book. Picked it up at a used book store, dreaming of moving to New Mexico. It lists all the peaks by mountain range/area. Has the vital stats (elevation, camping, climbing permissions, dificulty.) and black/white maps that show the general location of each peak/mountain. Also a small sectino on ski resorts in the state. Again this was last published in 1972, so some of the information may be out of date. But I doubt the mountains grew or shrunk much in that time."
3,Not to bad,"While not the greatest little package, not bad for the price. None of the software comes with any manuals besides what is on the cd (not that they are very complicated programs)."
2,It all sounds the same,I have been a big fan of Chirino but this c.d. and his last one sounds just the same. Different lyrics same music. I think is time for Willy to change his style and try something new. This sound is getting old and bouring.
1,Down is up and up is down,Timothy Leary was on a spiritual quest sequestered in a mansion. The G Man is the devil interrupting a spiritual quest in an attempt to find God. The G Man was going to protect American values by breaking into homes illegally. The G Man was going to protect democracy by violating the election(and other) laws of the democracy. GIVE ME A F#$*#@)$G BREAK! And Jimmy Carter let him out of prison. THE WORLD IS INSANE!
3,"Beautiful designs, but only 1 size!","This is a lovely book to look at, the designs are wonderful and there are many interesting patterns - and I would have given this book 5 stars except that no pattern has multiple sizing! And given that the garments aren't just the standard boxy shapes, it wouldn't be all that easy to modify for someone that doesn't happen to fit the size the pattern is written for. I would not buy this book unless it was heavily discounted because of this."
3,Strangely intriguing!,"The String Quartet Tribute To Audioslave is a really different way to listen to some of the best songs from the Audioslave and Soundgarden catalogue. All the rock is gone and replaced by eerie classical sounding strings recreating the grooves and melodies fans have come to love over the years. Highlights include the beautiful melody of ""Like A Stone"", the intense feel of ""Rusty Cage"", the slinky sound of ""Black Hole Sun"", the odd timing groove of ""Spoonman"", and the great melancholy melody of ""I Am The Highway"". Despite the weirdness of the whole concept, The String Quartet Tribute To Audioslave is an interesting musical experience that I can definitely recommend to fans of Chris Cornell's amazing vocal melodies. I picked this up out of sheer curiosity and although it's very weird I also think it's strangely intriguing."
5,What?,WOW... great product and did it ever ship fast and almost all the way across the country. I would do it all over again!
5,"Long range, easy to install!","I've used this with two completely different generations of notebooks: a 7-year-old IBM ThinkPad X21 still running on a Pentium III processor (!!!) and a much more recent Lenovo ThinkPad X200 with a Core 2 Duo. No problem in either case.Driver installation is a breeze and it works like a charm under both XP and Vista (tried both x32 and x64, no problem). Haven't tried included software, but I never use third-party programs to connect to a network; Windows manages that sufficiently well for day-to-day use."
4,Little to add that hasn't already been said...,"I don't have much to add that hasn't been said by previous reviewers- I agree with everything they've written about the earphones pertaining to sound quality, noise cancellation, and durability.My only issue with the earphones (which is the reason I rated them at 4 stars rather than 5) is that they are very bulky and heavy. Yes, they are extremely durable like one reviewer suggested, but I found them to be not practical for jogging. The heft of the cord bounced as I ran and eventually pulled the earbud from my ear. I had to revert back to the original and more lite ipod earbuds. I've never had a problem with earphones falling out of my ear when I run so I am suprised and disappointed that the shure's did not work out. I suspect that some users may not have this issue as their ears are shaped differently."
4,Good Isolation Earphones,"I'm a professional musician(guitar). I bought these to use as a Personal Ear Monitor. I had used set of over-the-ear sound isolation headphones (Direct Sound Extreme Isolation Headphones) until they broke. I was looking for a less obtrusive alternative. I play right next to our drummer and these earphones shield my ears quite well.The SE210's sound good but are lacking in bass. I ended up just adjusting the EQ and so that they sound good. I am also using them for my music listening when I am in noisy places.I couldn't justify spending the money to buy the most expensive pair that Shure makes, and am very happy with what I received for my money."
5,Do you like great sound on the go?,"You're gonna want these headphones, then. Not only are they made to travel, but they got every kind of fitting, for every kind of earhole(but keep in mind you will be sticking these in your ears, so use the cleaning tool with the headphone set regularly). The sound is some of the best I've heard, and has convinced me to go for the higher end models, once the means becomes available. No, it's not cheap, but as a musical explorer, I'd say they're worth every bright green buck you'll drop on buying it. I know I have no regrets in all the things I went through, just to get it(but I suspect most people won't travel 20 miles, just for an awesome set of headphones anyhow)"
2,Good fit but poor sound.,"I purchased the SHURE headphones as replacements for the awful BOSE in-ear headphones I dislike so much. I own Shure microphones and figured that they know sound and believed that the earphones would have good sound quality. I was wrong. The sound quality is very poor. They sound tinny and thin with poor bass tones.I must say that the buds themselves fit in the ear well. They offer several sizes of squishy foam buds which conform to the ear very comfortably.For some strange reason though, they made the headset cord only eight inches long! This means you always have to use an extension cord (which they supply). Very odd design.This headset cost $150 at the local Apple store. A big disappointment for the price. So, the search goes on for a set of great headphones."
2,Fire Back,The product as shipped was fine. The problem is that the first fire I had in my fireplace after installation of the fire back produced a crack in it starting at the upper left hand corner and ending at the center. I am still using it hoping that the crack will not advance all the way to the bottom which will render the thing useless.
5,Protects damaged brick,"Good and heavy (50 lbs), wedged between an iron bar and the grate, covers damaged brick."
4,Not just a Lanza look-alike,"I first became acquainted with Ricardo Cassinelli in smaller supporting roles. I was pleasantly surprised to find this anthology in which he sings aria from some of the leading tenor roles and is by no means a ""tenorrino"". In some songs his voice production and timbre are very like that of the late Mario Lanza - which may, or may not, be a recommendation for you. The grace and beauty he brings to the Mozart and Tschaikowsy arias are outstanding; for these items alone it is worth acquiring this CD."
5,General Book Review,"I am using this book in a senior eletrical engineering course. This is an excellentally written text, though very mathematically. Even though it recommmends a calculus based course in Probability I would recommend a you also have a good grasp on working with modulus or mod (n). A course in number theory would help too. If you don't have hat then extra time should be dedicated to a course using this text."
2,Training for puppy,"I was disappointed with the content of this book. I expected a step by step how to book based on the title. I subsequently ordered a book by Cesar Milan - dog whisperer, but still no how to tips."
5,Fun Book for Me and My Dogs,"What a fun book! It is what it says ""the everything dog training and tricks book""--I wish they'd make a DVD showing how to do it also.Although, the way the tricks are broken down into steps make them very easy to do, so good book--doggies, it's play time!"
4,Standard body wash,"Nothing unique about it, decent masculine scent, lathers nicely, leaves no soapy residue. Gets the job done for a good price. Will likely purchase again."
4,HD MiniDV Digital Tape,"Came quickly, rattling around in outer box, but no damage. Seems to be price collusion in US on this product, however, as everyone has virtually the same price in the US, yet the very same thing is under 50% of the US cost in the UK!"
2,This is a rip off!!,"These tapes come out of a bulk package. The company resales them and makes a profit. They arrive through your mailbox so the company also makes out on postage as well. I will be buying my tapes at [...] for now on. Amazon has let me down make than once recently. I have boughten over three thousand in products for my film project, Fourever Young which is by Black Hart Films, but half of what I purchased was not what it said it was or lose like this."
1,"Promotes abusive ""therapy""","The author would have readers accept the unvalidated beliefs and practices of a fringe pseudo-psychotherapy called ""Attachment (Holding) Therapy.""

1,Alarm destroyed car's battery,"We purchased the Crimestopper alarm and had it professionally installed in our Toyota Landcruiser. After less than a month we first used the remote start feature and it drained and destroyed our car's 5-month-old battery. The same place that installed the alarm replaced the battery and once the new battery was in they saw the alarm was faulty. They disconnected the alarm to prevent further damage. We bought the alarm on a recommendation from a friend but will never purchase a Crimestopper alarm again. It cost us over $500 including the alarm, installation, towing the car and the new battery, not to mention the time and hassle."
5,Love this series,"I have all the Anaconda movies and would consider them a series so to speak. If you like the big snake terror or have seen any of the other anaconda movies, get it."
5,Seal Sniffer,"I bought my wife this baby harp seal and we both fell in love him. Unlike a lot of stuffed animals, he has an ambiguous expression on his face that lends itself to interpretation and animation. We even gave him his own myspace site (look up 'seal sniffer' on myspace). Our friends think we are a little insane - but that's okay."
1,Family Feud for Windows,"I ordered this game for my computer 2 times. After loading the game, it said it wa installed. However, when I went to play the game I got an error saying the game was not installed correctly?? I sent the error, but got no response.I thought the game was defective, so I sent it back and ordered another game. I had the same problem and sent the error, which again, I got no response from the manufacturer.I sent it back again and ordered the DVD version of the game. I have not received that yet, so hopefully will work for me.I do not know if my computer was not compatible for the game; however, I do not understand why the installation said complete & then I was unable to play the game because of an ""error""?"
1,Poor substitute for the web version,"This is a horrible game. It belongs in the dollar bin. The questions are terrible and the time is too limited. I wish I had never bought it. A complete waste of money. If you are thinking of buying this game, don't. Just stick with the free version."
2,DOESN'T WORK,"I HAVE XP WINDOWS AND HAVE HAVE USED OTHER AUTORUN COMPUTER GAMES. I WAS EAGER TO PLAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMESHOW GAMES. IT INSTALLS BUT KEEPS DEFAULTING. IT WILL SIT IN MY COMPUTER DESK DRAWER FOREVER, BECAUSE OF AMAZONS RETURN POLICY OF OPENED GAMES."
5,Family Feud,"I also have trouble with this game, the same as Wheel of fortune. I can play one round on this games and they chase my computer."
1,Family Feud,"It's horrible, it takes forever to load, the comments are the same, it can't distinguish 2 player or 1 player. When you try to turn it off you can't get it off your screen without sitting through 5 minutes of ""look at me"" about this horrible excuse for a pc game! A total waste of money, I bought one for myself and one for my mother-in-law. I have very happy I opened mine first, since she would never let me live down giving her that piece of junk!I wish I could get my money back!"
1,The most boring Exam readiness book ever.,"It would be nice if they covered the topics on the actual CCNA Exam. Adding stuff that is not tested on the exam like Apple Talk and the majority of frame relay stuff would be great for an informational book but not as an exam prep book. This book will put you to sleep after the 1st chapter. Buy the Sybex Exam Notes it's 10 times better, to the point. If you know absolutly nothing about Cisco Routers you may want to buy the regular Sybex book & a router."
2,Food processor,"It has nothing to do with Kitchen Aid, it is a good processor, but it lacks adequate cutting components so that everything comes out virtually chopped and ground. I mean there is no way to alter the coarseness or finesse of the cuts. Would not have gotten it, had I known it was like that, because I had an old Cuisinart and that was in comparison a work of art and great to use. Furthermore, the recipe book sent along by Kitchen Aid, was meager and a grim example of what I was trying to express all along."
1,Very short lifespan,"I bought the KitchenAid 9-cup food processor KFP740 in December of 2005. I have used it carefully, kept it clean, never dropped or damaged it, and not used it all that often actually. Fourteen months after I purchased it, the large plastic bowl began to deteriorate. Little pieces started breaking off it. I wrote the company, and they said they could do nothing except tell me where to take it for repairs. Now, 20 months after I bought the food processor, it has totally died. The handle came off in my hands, and as I examined it, it crumbled into dozens of plastic pieces. The machine is completely unusable now. It looked nice and ran well as long as its cheap casing lasted--but beware if you want this to survive beyond warranty."
2,"Would not consider this ""medium""","I received the bag very quickly, and it is a nice looking bag. However, my female cat is regular size if not on the petite side. She was smooshed in this bag and I felt so bad for her I had to return it. I ended up getting the ""medium"" sized regular Sherpa bag for a little less than this, and she has so much more room and is very happy.So I would consider this bag ""small"" not ""medium"".. and the same company that sells this bag sells the Medium sherpa bag for the same price and is much better in my opinion. I will sacrifice the convenience of the backpack for my cats comfort."
5,Great Amazon Service,"Very good price on this. I've paid locally for this and this is a MUCH better deal than I get at the Kroger's.Also, my order arrived with 3 of the 30 bottles broken. No problem Amazon refunded me $3 since I didn't want to mess with sending the rest back for an exchange. Very fair, right?!"
2,Weak,"I bought 2 boxes; they arrived in 2 days and all vials were intact.However, the liquid barely tastes like Ginseng; I suppose it's super-diluted, but I'd be happy to be convinced otherwise.Energy-wise, I haven't noticed any difference, even after taking 4 vials per day."
1,...forgettable - that's what u r!,"Sorry, but this album is just too weak. I mean, David's good looks have always been a part of his success, but that doesn't give him the right to deliver a meaningless pop/rock album full of numb tracks that noone remembers. The singles ""Leap Of Faith"" & ""Teach Me"" are OK, but the entire album relies on them, and the songs get worse as the CD runs. You don't realize when it has ended. If you can get over the Charvet-fascination, you'll see this is NOT A REALLY GOOD ALBUM."
3,A little behind in modern training techniques,"With years of experience in training working dogs, I have decided to try Agility for a break in the routine! I thought this book would be good, but, alas, it is way behind in training techniques. I was quite put off by the mis-information, and in some cases, harmful information given. Very dissapointing. The author probably does have great depth of knowledge on the subject, but needs to attend a few up to date classes in dog communication, Operant Conditioning, or training in drive (all quite simular in application) and then re-write the book."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this product as a cheap way to make a couple of bends. I was using 22 ga mild steel sheet metal and the bender bar bent on the very first bend. Not to mention, it didn't even bend the sheet metal cleanly - the bend radius was different in the center versus the ends. Total junk and I wasted $30. I would not recommend it since the bend I was trying to make was well within the documented limitations of the tool."
2,not to happy,bought this jewel to replace a messy grind and brew after the 3rd usage it stopped grinding
2,Less than complete...,"I found Lau's book to be less-than-complete in offering a comprehensive list of Chinese Associations. If you are looking for specific Light Industry and Consumer Product Associations in China, better keep looking as they are not referenced in this publication.Furthermore and most disappointing, after submitting the necessary paperwork to obtain access to the ""Online Database"" -which is advertised as being included with the purchase - I never received my username and password from the publisher...and my emails went unanswered."
1,not value for money,"The book promises a lot. It can easily be read in an evening. All it delivers is a lot of trite sayings that you could pick up in any essoteric book. It does not contribute 1 iota to the overall knowledge on Huna. The best thing in the book is the five pages of Bibliography at the end, because all she does is simply review others works. It is the standard of a research paper by a high school student which I would have difficulty in passing. Overall all I have purchased is an expensive bibliography which I did not need.Professor The Grand Duke of Avram, D.Litt.etc."
2,Plot the same as #1,The story of this book is almost indistinguishable from that of the first. Handful of people invade an evil fortress and can only succeed by allowing our protagonist to be captured. Yawn.
1,not recommended,"Ok, first off, I hate when the characters think to themselves, I can take it if it is only a very small amount, but the author really doses the reader with italics of the characters thinking to themselves this or that, almost like a movie. It's as if the author was just looking for a movie deal with this work. I read all three books, by far the best part is the beginning of the 2nd book telling some history of the world she has created. Much more time could have been spent in world building, and much much less in how the characters thought or acted. Also, if you are looking for epic battles etc... look elsewhere. The only thing epic about this series was the cliched interaction with the characters with each other or themselves. I read the whole series only because once I start a series, it is very very hard for me to abandon it...wish I had never started it."
5,the perfect blend of fantasy and the hint of horror,"the perfect matchup, when damien and the hunter meet sparks fly which make it even better and more suprising when you wonder what the outcome will be when they got to watch each others back. the question of friend or foe will definately arise. priest v.s. ruthless killer. but they have to team up what will happen when their quest is over???"
5,goo!,"It's just too cool, especially with Melissa Chan starring at UC Davis and at Piedmont Hills High School"
2,Holster damaged blackberry!!,"The cigarette and home chargers work fine but the holster damaged my blackberry. The design is just not right, everytime you try and release the device it will damage it (specifically the chromed section)."
3,Important book for learning the origins of Christian Science,"This book shows clearly how many of Mary Baker Eddy's ideas concerning Christian Science were actually taken from the work of Phineas Quimby. Quimby was not a very well educated man, but he was an empiricist who devoted decades to studying how healing works. He concluded that disease is essentially an error of mind, and that the two biggest perpetrators of this fraud were the medical profession and religious leaders. Eddy had been a patient of Quimby's, and only began to teach after his death, originally attributing much of her method to him, and then later referring to him only as a mesmerist, something he had abandoned years before.Apart from setting the record straight on sources, the work in interesting as an alternate viewpoint. Quimby is not as good a writer as Eddy, and is very repetitive in spots, but his slant is somewhat different, and interesting in his own right."
5,beautiful pen that writes well,"Elegant but simple, not fancy gold. Writes very nicely. I know that pen enthusiasts rate this model higher than many of the more expensive models."
4,My favorite singer,"This is a great CD. Despite the obvious technical limitations at the time of original recording, the sound quality on this CD is really good. I love Marian Anderson (as a contralto myself,I strive to be like her)and I think this CD does her justice. It's great to hear the range of her vocal talent. The combination of opera and spirituals is wonderful. The songs also vary in vocal range. I was happy to hear a collection of songs that showcased the strength of her voice at its lower and upper ends. Overall, I'd say this was an excellent CD."
4,Good read on ClubBells,"I purchased the book after picking up 2-15lb clubbells. I have a bad shoulder sometimes and wanted to work on my rotation strength. This book provides a good deal of exercises that engage the clubs, and I've found them to be engaging and depending on the amount of reps, very difficult. I'd initially dismissed ClubBells as another fad, but I've seen some nice gains in my strength in my bad shoulder, and have improved my rotation nicely.The book also includes several different types of sport specific workouts, helping one custom tailor their workouts."
1,Save your money!,"This can opener is the pits. It is so sorry I can't even rate it. One star is too good for it. On 99% of the cans I've tried to open with this piece of junk, the blade comes out after about 1/2 in. into cutting. You have to force the blade out to release the can and start over for another 1/2 in. This goes on until you get all the way around the can. I am right now looking for another can opener."
2,WHY Do I KEEP Buying This??! Please Suggest An Alternative!,"Hmmm, I just realized that this would have been the FOURTH time replacing this SAME can opener within the span of 5 year! I've read a few of the reviews and see now that the flaws in this particular opener are common!The only reason I keep replacing it with this same one is because it mounts under the cabinet, up and off the counter tops..I think that's it's only quality! It no longer comes with a built-in knife sharpener..guess B&D figured they could make even more money selling a knife sharpener alone as a small appliance! The piercer that opens the cans quickly became dull to the point it will no longer open a can without force. IF I am successful in piercing a can, I have to hold it so it won't fall and again I have to force ""walk"" the can around as it will not make the revolution on it's own.Can anyone suggest a GOOD under cabinet mount can opener please??"
3,It's ok,I must admit I was expecting something heavier and better quality. This is made out of plastic with rubber contacts to prevent it from slipping. I placed my duosharp stone on it and placed the whole thing on my tile counter tops. The rubber feet do slip after the countertops get wet (which they will since you need the water to lubricate). The little rubber mat that came with the duosharp stone I bought was better. I did like the fact that it raises the stone so it makes it easier to use.
1,"Useless, vague, outdated","The content is so non-specific and vague, the book is useless. Thats because the authors do not write anything that is not already common sense. If you have common sense, why waste your money on reading something that does not add any additional detail or specificity. There are other much better resources. As a fourth year med student, the great emptiness of this book is unavoidable."
1,Motorola SLVR Snap on Red Crystal case,This however is a Motorola SLVr l7 accessory but it does not fit METRO PCS motorola Slvr L7
5,"This is a great film! Payne, Oakie and Faye Shine!!!","Set in the heart of the song publishing business is TIN PAN ALLEY, Payne and Oakie are hard luck song publishers trying to get a foothold in the business. They get Faye and equally beautiful Betty Grable to sneak one of theirs into a vaudeville show and the romance and songs keep rolling along. Specialty acts Roberts Brothers and those ever-so-sweet Brain Sisters only add to this picture. Highlight songs include a tear-jerking presentation of America, I Love You and K-K-Katy. A delight throught it's end, great supporting cast make this a film you will rewind and watch again and again."
1,WARNING!!,"I'll preface this review by saying that my 8 year old daughter, an exceptional reader, loved this series of books . . . that's where the one star comes from.However, as a parent, I'm quite disturbed that this series of books is marketed to young children. From the artwork, the size of the text and the synopsis on the back cover nothing suggests that there are mature themes being dealt with.Specifically, the main character has a pregnancy charm and a prince who is basically telling her, -you know you want it- after she shoves him away when he starts undressing her.Maybe this book would be a good conversation starter for a preteen, but not an 8 year old."
5,The Best Books Ever,These books were the best sooks that I ever read. They are about a girl who tries to become a knight in a world dominated by men. Trying to become a knight is only the beggining of her adventures though. I hope you like this book as much as I did. It's a great book for girls.
5,Great,"Okay. First off, I would like to clear the air about a few things.There are no explicit sex scenes in this book. There aren't any humongo-take-up-half-the-book references in it. However, I would not recommend these to a nine year old. Alanna does sleep with Jon, George, and Liam, but Ms. Pierce included these relationships specifically so that Alanna seems more human.The story is great. I could not put them down until I had finished the series.And I personally thought Alanna was way better off with who she ends up with in the end.I didn't like Jon. At all.They were just long enough so that I didn't get bored while I was reading them.Alanna is awesome. She knows what she wants and she goes after it with a resourceful mind and a quick tounge.These books were a great read for me.5/5"
2,Good but dissapointing,"I really enjoyed this series and thought it was well written and enjoyable other than the fact that Alana sleeps with anyone that shows interest in her at the drop of a hat. What kind of role model for young girls sleeps around, she finishes with one man just to move on to the next, and it seems to be excuseable because she is a knight. I am dissapointed that such a charming heroine is such an easy trashy person. Basically what one of the princesses says at the end of the books is true, Alana is [promiscuous]."
4,autthors you can trust,Cassandra Clair recommends these books. My granddaughters are fans of hers and they are now ready the books for the second time within one week of receiving them and will I am sure read them as many times as the Harry Potter books and that's some record
5,Just What The Doctor Ordered!,"I needed a new tool case and this one fit the bill. The three trays work out great as tool storage and the top drawer, by using the dividers, allows you to set it up for a large number of screws, nuts, etc. The top area works out well for placing tools or, in my case, my cleaners and such. Overall a really handy tools storage case!"
4,Great for mountain hiking,"These are fabulous socks. I wear them with nylon sock liners, when hiking in the mountains of western Washington state. They keep my feet dry and comfortable, with just the right amount of cushioning."
1,Poor customer service,I would never use this company again. It was too difficult to return the product....and I still do not know if I have received the credit?When I received the order it was not what I expected. No stars.
4,Small but fun,This book was a little smaller than I expected but if you are a Wilde fan you will certainly enjoy it!Some of the controversial quotes are sure to get a response if you try them as Facebook status messages. :)
5,There was no one quite like Oscar...!,And this collection of his quips is a pure delight. Well thought out and deliciously compiled - a must for any Wildeophile...!
5,TURNED ON TURNED ME ON,"for the record TURNED ON is not the earliest recordings of the ROLLINS BAND. they released HOT ANIMAL MACHINE, HENRIETTA COLLINS..., LIFETIME, and HARD VOLUME prior to it. the band containing ex-GONE members, sim and andrew put out albums from LIFETIME on. the first two were done with chris haskett and some foreign diplomats of hard rock. the TURNED ON album, tears you up. the emotional outpouring from the band themselves through their instruments and the release of henrys life through his throat can bring a grown man to his knees. for all of those who dont know the album was recorded on one track to be listened to at one time in order for the listener to experience the ROLLINS BAND live without actually being there, well, thats what HENRY told me, anyway. if you are in search of genre defying, deaf defying, heart and soul and fingers and blood music, give this album a spin...its garaunteed to warp your axle."
1,So loud it upset the neighbors.,An amazing shreiking noise peirces my ears every time I use it. My friends can't line up the can.
1,Does Not Work,"This can opener is horrible. It just does not work for me. I can even open a can of dog food or a can of soup without it messing up.Instead of all the little extras, they should include a manual can opener so at least you can get your darn can open."
2,mah 2300 or 2500??,is it just me or can't anyone see that the picture in the bottom left side say these batteries are 2300mah while the description says 2500mah. Which is it??
1,"Good for a while, a very little while","I traditionally use rechargeable batteries, so I expect some loss in charge. However, these batteries are the worst I have seen. In one case the batteries were dead by the end of a vacation. In another case, they died after only a week or two of storage. There is something wrong with these batteries. I would avoid them."
1,Junk,"I have about 40 of these things. I thought I'd replace all the AA in the house and trusted the name. The 2500AH rating suggested they had the storage power to work in almost any application. I've used nothing but 2 Energizer's chargers purchased as part of a package with batteries. These things are junk! They exhaust very quickly in every application I've used them in. They also loose their ability to recharge in short order, I doubt it is 10% of the advertised endurance. I went back to alkaline for now until someone can produce a good rechargeable. Good idea, terrible quality!"
2,2-3 days worth of wireless keyboard/Mouse use from 1 charge,"I bought these batteries for one main reason, wireless keyboard/mouse. The batteries rarely last 3 days, usually under 3. I use the 8 hour charger for best charge also. It is frustrating when you have to wait 8 hours to use the keyboard. My batteries self deplete so fast I wonder if I have memory problems. I am not satisfied with these batteries at all. Am looking to other companies for better a better product."
2,The battery self discharge rate is horrible.,I have bought two sets of Energizer NIMH AA batteries and had them forabout 1 year. As others have reported they seem to work fine forabout 2 to 3 months and then they self discharge rate makes thebatteries almost unusable. After fully charging the batteriesand trying to use them one week later my digital camera willtell me to change the battery pack without even using them.
2,fast self-discharge,these batteries have a fast self-discharge. their not as bad as duracell 2650mah but their still pretty bad. stick with accuevolution or eneloop
1,a very shammy product,"I was very much disappointed to find out the ink cartridge I have purchased from HP, did not do exactly too well with my printer. Although I have a printer that is in a good condition, I do not like to waste my ""dinero"" on any of my office products to say the least; also Hewlett Packard needs to step up their game when in regards to its office products, money can be lost yet I hope not."
3,HP-22 Ink Jet Cartridge,The ink is great. The fact that it only has 5ml of ink is a ripoff. Most cartridges have at least 10ml of ink and most cartridges can hold up to 15 ml of ink. Yea 5ml holds the cost down but half the ink shouldn't cost only 25% less.
2,NOT ENOUGH COPIES COMPARED TO GOOD REMANUFACTURED ONES.,I have paid half as much & gotton double the copies with good quality. Why should I pay for their advertising.
5,great product,"I'm well satisfied with this product.It arrived on time and is working great, I will probably buy another when needed if the price is right. Thank You......."
2,A little disapointed,It fits a little tight and is really thin. Feels very cheap I love my Vibez MP3 player it is very well made but this just doesn't live up to what I expected.
5,Better than Stephen King's The Mist 3-D audiobook!,"This presentation really shows the potential of 3-D audio. It's all in the details. I was listening to this on headphones (the only way to get the full effect), and at one point a cuckoo clock goes off behind your right ear.I turned around to see where it was! And I was outside!It had nothing to do with the plot, it was just a little showing off on the part of the technicians, but that made it for me. As well, the scene at the end just envelopes you in the sounds of the hands.I highly recommend it."
2,"Uh, what can I say...","If your curious about radiohead...well you might learn something. And of course noone expects these things to be great literature. So you pretty much know what you're getting into here. This book was poorly written, sort of trite. Not much to say about it. Just don't expect much and you'll be fine."
2,Out of date,This book was required reading in my University of Washington Modern Japan class.But it was pointed out that a lot of it is out of date and we read specific things from it.
2,"not ""all natural""","while there are a lot of good things in this product, and i really wanted to try it, i can't bring myself to use it. i've been searching for all natural products, and making my own as well. the product description doesn't list the actual ingredients, and i think that should mandatory for all online marketplaces. the main ingredient is vegetable oil, number two is mineral oil, which i don't want on my body at all, then a few good things, then a few more bad things, and a few bad dyes and things. i can't speak to the efficacy of the product, because i didn't try it, but if you're looking for an all natural, plant-based product, this is not it"
1,I didn't realize it contained mineral oil,No problems with seller. But product contains. Mineral oil. Too Bad ! I'm glad it was cheap enough for me to be able to just throw out without shedding too many tears. Next time I'll pay more attention. Sorry but dissapointing.
3,Fine but not great,"This product works fine for your hair if they are dry, however it says to put it on and leave it on overnight...I couldn't do that! The smell is so strong that I couldn't sleep. I was consireding to turning it back because of the smell but first I decided to try to leave it on during the day when I am at home. This is way better! It nourrishes your hair and let them smooth and shiny. The shipping cost is very high, but the bottle lasts very long."
3,Fragrant Flowers,"This oil is very good for the scalp if you don't mind the distinct smell. It was not unpleasant, however, it lingered a bit. I use it for scalp massages."
5,Love,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It is very cute they are expecting their fourth baby in May.
5,The Silver Sea yields up its treasure,"My review for this album is the same as I made for her first CD: It is wonderful to listen to all of the songs, Meav has an extraordinarily beautiful voice and I highly recommend this as well as her debut album"
3,Goooodish,"I bought these bath toys for my daughter who is 6 months old and she just LOVES them! They are light and easy for her to handle and throw around when out of the tub and in the tub she enjoys watching me fill them up with water and squirt it out. The one thing I do not like about these is there is no real way to sanatize them before giving them to my child, I tried to boil them in water like I do with her other toys but it just melted away some of the coloring, I actually had to throw one of them away because I wasn't going to let her chew on something that had paint peeling... Other than that I think they are very good for a baby still learning how grasp toys."
5,So cute!,"My daughter loves them, okay? They look very atractive to any toddler that's for sure. Thank you. - Mrs. E. Cohn, Chicago, Illinois"
5,Kids Enjoyed.,We ordered these for the grandkids and they got a real kick out of it. They are a real big blast.
3,Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,Got this for my lil man....who loves bath time! The name caught my attention (one of his nicknames) It's so-so!
2,"Sturdy but poorly designed, difficult to clean","I've been using this food processor for a few months now and have noticed several things about it. First being that it's really sturdy, all the pieces and bowls seem like they'll last forever.However, all the blades and bowls are impossible to get clean. There are so many notches, rims, and little crevices that are impossible to get a sponge into. It's probably OK if you intend to put all the pieces into a dishwasher, but if that's not an option for you, then I'd recommend another food processor.The other thing that's annoying is the electrical cord is really short.All of these flaws are things that could have been avoided with a bit of foresight by the design team."
5,Excellent food processor,"I received this food processor a few weeks ago and am so pleased! The old one does not allow me to perform the whole recipe in one time. As this model has several bowls, you can use them without clean each time you process something for the recipe. The model is also more silence than the old one.I didn't like the citrus juicer, I could not use it very well."
5,Kitchen Aid KFPM 770 NKO Food Processor,"A good product at a good price. Like so many products, manufacturers loadthem up with safety switches that are made to keep people from injuring themsesves, that probably shouldn't be operating any kind of equipment, under any circumstances. Prevents lawsuits by these people, so I guess they serve their purpose.I thought I followed the directions for assembly to the letter, but I ended up having to call customer service, and found out one little thing I hadn't done right. I have to say, if all employees were like the one I talked to, it would sure make people's lives simpler. He even registered it for me."
5,Great when used with the DMT aligner,If you are getting the aligner and you plan on sharpening several knives just order this as well. It takes quite awhile to reprofile a knife with the blue stone but this one does it much quicker and will save you from buying a new blue stone after wearing the first one out.
2,Good thing to use...make sure your careful,"I had been looking into getting ben wa balls for some time and ventured on the ones you see here. When they arrived I noticed there were flakes of ""gold"" in the case...rule number one if you decide to use ben wa balls purchase the kind that are not plated. Usually if they say gold assume that it's not really or the price will tell you what u need to know...I didn't think it all the way through... I comment on this for reasons that should be obvious to most. You dont want to stick anything inside your body for any reason; even good ones, that is not hygienic. So whether your looking into ben wa balls because your having problems holding your urine, seeking an extra sexual thrill or want to give your p****! that extra ""pull"" go with something more natural...I'd say jade is the best bet. Easy to clean and even beautiful to look at..."
3,Title should be 'fundamentals' not 'guide',"I did like this book, in fact I learned a lot from it. However, after sitting the CCDA exam I can now say that this book should not be called an exam guide. It would be better titled 'exam fundamentals' -- it certainly gives you all the background info you should have for the CCDA, but it is seriously lacking in test specific questions, and does not focus on what will really be on the test. Read this book first to get up to speed, but then choose something else for the actual exam prep.Also the CD-Rom test engine was full of silly errors. but still useful to reinforce the knowledge (but the questions on the exam are far different)"
3,Poorly written and wordy,"This book is pretty poorly written. Its kind of hard to follow and way too wordy. Alot of extra dialouge is included that doesnt really explain anything. But there are good points, the case studies are very good prep, and the test questions are helpful as well."
2,Just go buy Designing Cisco Networks,"This is not a bad book. The only problem is that it is basically just a study guide to DCN. So, if you are just getting into Internetworking, this book is going to be a bit over your head. It assumes a level of knowledge that just doesn't make sense for a entry level certification guide."
4,"Good book, bad exam!","The book isn't the problem... the problem is decoding Cisco's cryptic questions on the exam! Be sure to go over the Case Study sections of this book a few times, you'll need to be familar with the style for this exam!"
4,Great results on this one.,Had tried other brands of this very same suplement and found this one best for me. The additional ingredient B6 works very well in aid at night time.
1,Gave it a try....,"I didnt have much hope that this will actualy do something, I just gave it a try because its not expensive.... and its money wasted. If you think like me ""Ahh.. lets give it a try...."" well try something else, maybe go for a bit more expensive stuff. But the main question here is... who the hell left this 5 star reviews...."
2,Cute but disappointing,"Unfortunately, this toy broke only 1 week after we got it. The wind up part wouldn't wind.And when it did the song was too short."
3,import,"I knew it was a good price.I knew it is a great brand.I was still surprised to see it was made in ""China""."
5,A concise guide to the failures of modernity,"Budziszewski has managed to effectively distill the confusion and dislocation of modernity into a convenient, readable, and short text that should grace the home of any thinking Catholic (or Christian in general). His understanding of the Natural Law and its implications for our lives is easily accessible and deeply persuasive. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking an introduction to the intellectual underpinnings of Christian morality."
1,My family is the family that was talked about in this book.,"If it wasn't for the fact it's been many years, I would sue this author for defamation of character. My family was totally played as the worst kind of trash, I was personally portrayed as some disheveled out of control child. It's pathetic that the author was able to misconstrue how things happened and get away with it. This should have totally been on the cover of The Enquirer rather then printed as serious journalism of what was truly a horrific find by my father."
3,"The headphones are good, the cords broke down","Within 9 months of using them in mixed weather, e.g. cycling and hiking in winter conditions the cords on these headphones started to crack ultimately ruining the headphones.The headphones themselves are good and I'm considering getting new ones, but the cords themselves can't be directly exposed to bad weather over a prolonged period or they'll crack and peel off."
1,Pointless,It is sad to think that this movie passes for entertainment. It really is not worth the time. I think that I was too tired to move to shut it off and so stupified at the emptiness. A young woman so wrapped up in herself and in her past that she never bothers to grow up. She relives highschool and plays out all the petty and selfish acts of a pampered girl. There were issues that the writers could have explored but chose not too. Dumb heroine and elementary story line. Don't waste the time.
2,Watch out for some topics discussed,"My 1st grader was assigned this book to read. She could read the book fine, but the contents is definitely for the older kids. The book talks about divorce, parents with boyfriends, masacre of Barbies, bras... definitely not appropriate for the younger crowd. The other problem of course is she can read it fine, but doesn't follow the story because the topics are for more mature kids. I'm sure there are other books at this same reading level with less mature topics."
3,"Okay, but not great","I found this book to be adequately written and produced, but just didn't like many of the recipes. I ended up copying half-a-dozen onto index cards and then giving the book to my public library ... I'm sure others will find more to enjoy than I did. I ordered ""The Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes"" by Better Homes and Gardens, at the same time, and much prefer it . . . marked lots of recipes to try. . . so you might want to look at that one too."
4,A great and easy way to start to learn C,I found the book to be written very clear and easy to understand and covering the basics of C. With many screenshots and code that had differt colorings made following the examples alot easier to follow. If your starting off in C programming and not looking for something intimidating then this is a good book to start with.
2,I wish I didn't waste $20.00,"Last year I had decided to begin learning C programming to prepare myself for a programming class I had signed up for the next year. Unfortunetly my book store didn't have much selection, so the series of 'in easy step' books was the only choice I had. I had paid $20.00 to buy this book.I began reading it and found that it a bit hard for a beginner like me to catch on. I mean, almost every subject book is give 2 pages or less. For the price you paid you could buy MUCH BETTER C books on Amazon. Buying a great 850 book (While this is 138 pages) only go for 3x cents on Amazon... so why even bother buying this thin book which briefly goes over every topic. At most I'd recommend this as a reference book. As a learning tool... Look around a bit more."
3,incremental improvements,"Essentially an incremental update of Office, with some mostly cosmetic improvements and a useful new floating palette function. It's good that Microsoft has stopped simply porting the Windows version of Office to the Mac; however, if you are happy with Mac Office 98, you should look at the ""new"" features carefully to ensure upgrading is worth the hassle and the cost. Beware of the included Value Pack as well, it will slap several hundred Mb of flashy clip art and bloated document templates on your hard drive if you aren't careful."
5,Great Wedding Band,"I got this ring for my husband because we're a young couple on a budget! This ring fits him perfectly, looks great on his hand and still has a nice shine to it. He loves it and never takes it off, and there are still no scratches or those disgusting green stains some rings leave behind. Good investment!"
5,Nice ring!,Very nice ring at a reasonable price. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife to wear as a thumb ring. She is delighted with it. Arrived promptly in a nice little round metal jewelry box complete with a bow and ready to put under the tree.
5,works like a charm!,"I previously tried everything short of a sledge hammer to remove a mouthpiece from an old cornet. This gizmo took about 2 seconds. So easy, almost unbelievable. Should be six stars!"
1,sneaky shipping charge @ Amazon.com,"As I read down the prices of a tv I wanted to buy, every one of the comparison companies listed their shipping charges in the tax and shipping fee column...Every one that is except Amazon.com which blatantly put ""free shipping."" Imagine my surprise when I filled out my purchase and there under shipping was approximately $ 80.00. Free!! my arm!"
1,Deceptive advertising for Shipping,"The same thing happened to me as the person who posted the January 27, 2006, I did a google search from my home page and typed in this specific TV and I got the following:Toshiba MW26G71 $55026"" Widescreen TV/DVD/VCR Free US Shipping Avail.www.amazon.comI clicked on the link and went to order this TV and the shipping charge was 79.99. When I called them about this, all she could tell me was why there was a shipping charge. I explained that this is deceptive advertising and I think this is illegal. I explained that she needs to forward this up for someone to take care of. I really want the TV, but now it is a matter of principle, so will go to Best buy, who is offering free shipping."
3,"Best Motocross Out There, But Still Disapointing","I've played several recent motocross type games for the PC and in my opinion this is the most intriguing; however, don't expect Tony Hawk's Pro Skater gone motocross. The physics are fun (because it's easy to get a lot of air), but the game play gets old. Combos are very hard to pull off, and it seems that you hit more trees than checkpoints in the racing modes. It may be worth renting, but I wouldn't want to add this to my collection. There is a reason this game is always on sale."
5,The Best!,"Motocross Madness 2 is simply the best driving game there is... It's not just a game, it's THE Game! Have Fun!!"
2,Recycled with lesser content.,"First they screwed the art, then they screwed the story, now they screwed the art further and the story is recycled. All the one-liners, angst, everything is redone all over again. The writer and artist are getting lazy."
1,Not usefull,"This book containes lots of pretty pictures but not a lot of helpful information on the ""how to"" details for someone new to the process."
3,Great for beginners ...,"Really only for beginners. Good for basics for simple home photoediting, but not if you want to go pro for stock/commercial work."
5,Good value,"Great price, 1/3 what it cost for another laptop battery.No issues with fit as read in other reviews.No issue with color difference, like it should really matter anyway.Averaging near 3 hours runtime using a custom build of Win7 Ultimate."
5,The ticket for a Macbook,"This is just what my son needed for his Macbook. He says it's worked perfectly, allowing him to view SD cards as removable drives."
4,Installation was very straightforward,I like this product. It was easy to install and works great. The only downside is it will automatically create 4 more hard drives on your system (even if you don't have a memory card installed in a slot).
5,Works,"I only have three different media cards at this time but they fit into this product well, not like the one built into my printer."
4,"Works OK, light, versatile. Beware error in description.","I have used SD and SmartMedia cards so far (at the same time), and the unit works flawlessly, no loose connections or problems reading the cards.However, please note that the ""microSD (SD adapter included)"" description is incorrect, it is NOT included (the package even reads ""MicroSD adapter required"")."
3,"Functional, but not pleasant.","It's small, it installs each card as a different drive, includes a utility that labels which drive letter takes which card, and lets you know when a card has been recognized. It has a activity light which isn't very informative, but at least lets you know when the card is being accessed. I especially liked that it doesn't load a bunch of digital media file management bloatware. However, it usually requires some removing and re-inserting and wiggling to get it to recognize SD and MMC cards. Also, as you might expect, it's plastic and feels light and cheap. I have no idea how long it will last.EDIT 3-2006: Had to uninstall the software that labeled the slots by the media type, because it was buggy and kept crashing explorer."
3,string lights,"While the product finally arrived, it was shipped one week later that stated. I paid to have it shipped express but needless to say it was late. No response from seller after writting 2 emails. Never again will I buy from this company."
3,Interesting!!!!,"it's a good book, it can show you the close ups of snogs that people do, and both genders doing it as well as the old peopl"
1,Awful Quality,"The book feel apart within 3 weeks. I didn't throw it off a building, my dog didn't eat it. Just...fell apart. Enough said."
5,Cult Classic Game...based on the Cult Classic Film.,"The Warriors is an action packed beat-em up video game,based on the 1979 Cult Hit of the same name.There is a story mode you play through,along with other things to do.Such as free roaming around Coney,doing little side missions,or just screwing around,by busting stuff up,robbing people,running from the cops and more.There are some really cool unlockables in this game as well.Like the ""Armies Of The Night"" arcade mini-game,where you go around busting up rival gangs,while playing as Swan.This mode is really fun with two players.There are other cool unlockables.Such as the brawl mode.Where you can pick a turf,pick a Warrior(or somebody else) and fight one on one with a character from the game,or with a gang member.Overall,this game is a blast,and I HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Gets the job done!,"Before getting started let me say that I'm a guy and really don't know my way around the kitchen!Pros:Cheap! At $20 this thing costs less than going out to dinner!Easy to use! I have yet to screw anything up that I've made using this thing and (see first line of review).Cons:Takes longer than a more expensive rice cooker.Timer is just a dial so you can't program it to start cooking at a later time.Verdict:If you eat a lot of rice look into a more expensive model with all the bells and whistles. However, if you only eat rice occasionally and are looking for a cheap and versatile appliance that can do rice and more then the Black&Decker; is well worth its price!"
5,Perfect for baby food,"This little steamer is awesome! I use it almost daily to cook up veggies for my kids, retaining all the nutrients veggies offer. I also use it for our dinner vegetables for the rest of the family. It's quick, you can steam almost everything in under 20 minutes, and you just put the stuff in and forget about it until the timer goes off. You can also put spices in to add subtle flavor, but if you really want to taste herbs or spices, you're better off putting them on afterwards. You can also poach fish and chicken, although I haven't tried that yet and it doesn't sound too flavorful. Anyways, it can hold a lot of stuff and .... you really can't go wrong."
2,No Plus Sizes Patterns,No plus sizes....wonderful patterns though - Melissa has to consider that many of us need larger sizes.....XL is just not big enough for me....
2,Luna Blanca again and again,"At first I would like to express that the sound settings are excellent, this in spite of the somewhat simple melodies. The fourth track's my absolute favorite. However, in general, this album shows too little variety in it's melody, chords keep on repeating and repeating. For example the second track, I'd suggest adding some instrument or a guitarist that is more virtuose!Summing it up...great sound settings...a little boring sound!"
2,Not So Good,"I was given this pepper mill as a gift. A++ for style, filling and ergonomics.. My only and fatal flaw was that it would not hold a grind setting. About every three or four uses I had to rescrew the grind setting pin back to my preferred setting. The pepper slowly ""devolved"" to a VERY coarse grind, which is fine (no pun intended) for some uses but I couldn't control the setting. I replaced it with another mill that doesn't look anywhere near as stylish. Very disappointed because it was really cool looking and my partner was so proud of having found the ""highest rated"" pepper mill for me. It was really hard to say ""but it doesn't work right..."""
1,bad product - don't buy,"This pepper mill's internal workings broke apart after a few months. I contacted the distributor in Massachusetts, both in writing and phone; they did not respond. I contacted Cook's Illustrated, who's review I had trusted; even they did not respond. Very disappointed."
4,"Almost perfect, but not quite...","Numerous authorities on cooking have rated this their favorite pepper mill, and while it may be the best mill out there, it is not flawless. It does, however, hold a huge quantity of pepper and grid it very quickly. Unfortunately, not only is it a bit ugly, but I find that I sometimes accidentally open the fill area while grinding, occasionally resulting in a peppercorn explosion when I invert the mill! Mostly just carelessness on my part, but I do wish it was a little *more* difficult to add more pepper!Pros:1) Big2) Fast3) InvincibleCons:1) Prone to accidental opening2) Not particularly attractive"
5,"Had this before, so I know!","I love doing crossword puzzles,however sometimes I need a little help with the answers, and I've tried other puzzle dictionaries but this one is by far the best when you need some help. Honest! Knowing also that it's websters dictionary helped me make up my mind as to which one to buy because there are others out there for sale but this is the best."
1,Useless Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"I purchased Merriam-Webster's Crossword Puzzle Dictionary and find it useless. In a one month period, doing crosswords daily, I have found 5 entries of any use. I also purchased a different crossword dictionary that seems to have most of the clues I have researched. Hmmmmmm..."
2,"A poor book, even for beginners in DM","The author is not able to clearly present/describe concepts without using many examples. For many subjects(even simple ones), the book is lacking in clarity and logic, so that it's hard to find out what the author is trying to say. Too many pages are wasted on irrelevant sentences. Don Box books contain difficult logic, but you feel his clarity and preciseness in his writing. George Shepherd books are also enjoyable to read even though the subjects covered are wide and not easy. This book is just the opposite: easy concepts presented with a messy, hard-to-follow style."
4,massage gloves,"These gloves last a long time, but need to be either hand-washed, or in the washer on the ""hand-wash"" cycle, if your washer has that setting. If you wash or wring them roughly, the wires can break, rendering one or more ""finger massagers"" useless (each finger has an individual massager).They don't fit small hands very well, but well enough to use. I like the gloves....very versatile. If you want to use massage oil, you have to cover them with a large-size latex glove (massage gloves must be on the hand in order for a latex glove to cover it with any possible ease...but it's still a challenge, albeit worthwhile).They sound like a swarm of bees next to your head. LOL! But they feel pretty good, and take 3 AAA batteries per glove."
5,Great juicer!,"We have a lemon tree, so use it so often to make lemonade. Would buy it again and highly recommend it, especially because of the ability to set the pulp indicator for the desired amount of pulp."
4,Works like a lion but feels like a lamb,"I was inspired to get a citrus juicer after I saw the Barefoot Contessa using one on the Food Network. That one was apparently heavy duty and this one is not, but it works quite well anyway. It's light and deceptively powerful -- you don't need to press very hard and -- before you know it-- every bit of juice is gone from the fruit you're holding. I would recommend this for someone who needs citrus juice on a regular basis."
4,Still going strong,"I bought this juicer in 2007, and although I don't use it every day, it's still going strong. It's easy to use and store. I recommend washing off the orange part soon after you use it, or else the dried pulp can be very difficult to remove. Overall, I like this product and it has worked well for me."
2,Reviews made this sound great,"The first week we had it, we loved this juicer and made several containers of OJ. Around week 3-4, the motor started clicking and slipping when we pushed down hard, so we stopped pushing hard. Keep in mind that when I say ""hard"" I mean about 10 lbs of force with one hand, less than you would use for a manual juicer.Long story short, after another week the clicking got worse, and we had to use progressively less and less force. Now it is so flimsy it doesn't work well at all, and to get it to work (I kid you not) I have to use earplugs because the clicking is so loud. The machine is light plastic and inexpensive, so I can't really say I'm surprised. I have to imagine that most of these other reviewers wrote their reviews in the first few weeks of use when it worked great.If you juice oranges a few times a month, then this juicer is for you. If you want regular juice, then I would recommend another brand/model."
2,Not very durable,"I juice pretty much every day, about 2 grapefruits a day. I have had this juicer for less than a year and a few months after buying it, I am ready to trash it. In the beginning it worked fine but now whenever I try to use it, the motor catches and pauses frequently and makes a weird grinding noise before it will start rotating and juicing again. So it takes a long time to juice anything, and the noise is very irritating. I guess to get a truly durable product that works seamlessly, I will need to spend a lot more. I guess this is good if you are not into frequent/heavy juicing."
4,not bad for the price,"It seems to be holding up, although the pulp control is not the best in the world. For the money it is a good product to buy."
5,Excellent Product!!!,This is the best juicer I've ever used. It has so many features at a very reasonable price. I strongly recommend it.
1,Not good for a Black and Decker Product,"After just 4 uses, the motor broke and it was useless. Somehow you really cannot press down on the juicer when doing oranges or grapefruits. The product needs redesigning to cater for a little more pressure. Some fruit requires a little more pressure to get the juice.Won't buy it again!"
4,good juicer,Has worked well the dozen or so times we have used it so far and is relatively easy to clean. Fresh squezzed juice is a real treat.
1,Spigot Leaks,While a great idea for sun-tea. The spigot leaked all over our fridge. Save your money.
1,BIG MISTAKE!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS ITEM. The valve leaked the first time I tried it and cannot be fixed. A combination of poor design and cheap workmanship. I regret the $14.00 plus I spent (shipping was half the cost). I have own several sun tea jars over the years and I can tell you this one is a genuine, 24 karate piece of S--T."
3,The problem of Entourage,"Microsoft once again has not solved the problem of moving from PC to MAC-- if you have your life stored in PC outlook, don't even think about buying this. Switching to MAC is great... porting over applications is not bad. Porting over email and contacts is a disaster. Microsoft support is not much better-- spent 2 hours on the telephone trying to find anyone who could even address the issue. Never did. Bottom line: for MAC users with Office 98, not much functionality is gained. For PC users moving back to MAC, plan on fat-fingering in all of you data."
5,Great Kitchen Helper,This is a great product. Very easy to use and easy to clean. I highly recommend it. So much better than my old Cuisinart.
2,Misleading Features,"I agree with the extensively written review ""An Expensive Disappointment."" You cannot put liquids in this unit, not even small amounts. One would assume liquids are OK since the device has a ""liquid fill line,"" but customer service confirms that the device is not designed for liquids. The lid fits over the outside of the bowl and leaks a huge amount once the blade throws the liquid up against the sides of the bowl. I originally liked the 3-bowl design, but the blades only fit the large and small bowls. The instructions tell you that the middle sized bowl is for slicing discs only. I tried making mayo and ended up with a puddle of oil in the center near the blade. The same problem happens with any food, ending up with chunks hiding near the blade in the center. Not very well designed device."
4,My wife says it is her best friend,"This is a very good appliance. The first time I have a KitchenAid and I like it, It works fine and is very quiet, compared to my little Magic bullet which sounds like a tornado and with a lot less power than the KitchenAid. In general I am please with the results except one time I wanted to make grated cheese with mozzarella, better dont try it. It doesn't work. Buy instead grated cheese in the Grocery store.I has a lot of accessories so if you don't like it. I saw a new Cuisinart food processor that simplify the accessories in fewer and simpler components. I am not sure about how good is this new Cuisinart food processor but I saw it had better features than the KitchenAid Food Proccesor.I like the small bowl for smaller jobs because you don't have to clean the whole unit. It works fine and do its job nevertheless you have to plan the use if you don't want to do a lot of dishes."
3,Only okay and died after 4.5 years,"For many of the same reasons that others didn't like this food processor, I never loved it. The bowl leaks a lot, especially if you put in too much liquid food. Food gets trapped in the handle and can't be cleaned out. It worked okay for 4 years and then began to have problems. Died while making pie crust on Thanksgiving. I won't buy another and am looking for other brands. I do love my Kitchenaid stand mixer; in fact I have two. If you can find an older one, though, they're much better than the new ones. My old mixer is at least 10 years old and still going strong."
2,Plastic Parts too Flimsy,"I bought this food processor from Amazon about 18 months ago. It looked great on paper, and most Amazon reviews were positive. Looking back on the purchase, it has been a disappointment.The device has lots of parts, which makes it complex to use and complex to clean. This extra work load can makes it more a labor generating, than a labor saving device.By contrast, we also have a mini-prep food processor manufactured by Cuisinart. It is quick and easy to use and clean, so it gets used several times a month.The big Kitchenaid hardly gets used, and yet the plastic handle on the lid / feeder mechanism has cracked, and the safety interlock won't engage. I just ordered an replacement, which cost almost as much as the complete Cuisinart Mini Prep food processor.For the money I recommend you keep looking for something that is simpler and better made."
4,Really like my KitchenAid 12 cup Food Processor,I really like everything about this food processor but the feeding tubes are a cleaning challenge.
5,Exceedingly well for making biscuits,Replaced an old processor that I burned up making biscuits after only about 10 batches. This one feels like the mack truck of processors.
3,A little Awkward,"I found the large mouth on top and plunger a little awkward to use. In the essence of safety the plunger has to be inserted precisly into the vertical shaft. When doing a large amount of slicing it presents a cumbersome achievement. I would like to have an 8MM slicing disk but Kitchen Aid, said they have no plans to bring one to market. I wish I had taken a closer look at the Cuisinarts espcially the ones with an 8MM slicing disk."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE,"I have had this machine since 2004. I hate it. The first year I had it, I accidently fused the stem to the machine twice. I am giving it two stars because customer service was so great about replacing it no questions asked the first year. You can't fill it too full or you will fuse the stem onto the body of the machine. It is real easy to do this since the contents never distribute themselves evenly. After the first year, you are on your own. I recently tried grating cheese and the darn thing wouldn't come on for 20 minutes. Unfortunately it did come on. Otherwise I would have an excuse to get a new Cuisinart. My parents have a Cuisinart, which I have used many times. It is much easier to use and doesn't have this design flaw that the KitchenAid has."
2,Built in obsolescense,"I bought the previous model KFP450WW about 5 years ago and the blade and stem finally came apart after trying to shred some potatoes. After contacting KitchenAid and spending about 1.5 hrs trying to track down a replacement part, I finally concluded no one makes parts for this one anymore.I would have expected the company should be excited to keep selling $35 blades for old models pretty much indefinately, especially if they want customers to view their products as a long term investment into a high quality product.Unfortunately, I guess they figured out they can make more money by having customers buy a new $200 machine every 5 years. Oh well, I guess my otherwise perfectly good KitchenAid food processor is landfill now."
1,Bug Ridden,"Wow, this is bad software. It is completely bug ridden. I get indecipherable error messages every time I run the software. Microsoft should have cut down on the feature list and worked on stability of the software. I did not care for Adobe PhotoDeluxe either. Can anyone produce a simple package for the basic functions - e.g., cropping and fixing redeye???"
1,[Junk]! Seven disks worth!,"This package is the worst bunch of [junk] I have ever purchased. The utilities are marginal and the 6 disks of artwork (and I use the term ""artwork"" lightly) looks like it was made by a 3 year old. Well, it's not really fair to the three year olds out there to say that. The 1 star rating is due to the fact that there are no negative ratings. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."
4,777 vs. Zero,"Ok, yeah it only comes with 7 planes but a few minutes on the net and a few hours downloading and you will have enough planes to last you forever. As a student pilot I fight my instructor (and send him down in flames more often then not) and work on flying routes and such, not great practice, but its fun, oh and if you own FS2002 or 2000 just bring the airplanes over, its fun trying to dogfight in a 777, really it is!!!All in all a good game, AI needs a little help, and if you want a wingman who can hit the broadside of the barn you need to donwload an add-on, but overall its pretty darn good."
2,CFS2,This game is good but could be better first of all there is no pearl harbor for either sides and you need a top of the line bought yesturday computer to run it! so unless you like flying a frame rate per minute and you dont have a 800mhz computer i suggest you forgo this game.
1,Will NOT run under Windows NT,"Warning: This product will NOT run under Windows NT 4.0 - in fact, it will not even install. The Amazon.com web pages list WinNT as an acceptable platform for this game, but Amazon is mistaken. I called Microsoft (Games Tech Support) and was told that it was NOT made to run under WinNT and will not even install (as I found out the hard way).Microsoft told me, however, that ""Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator"" (the original WW-II Europe version) DOES work on WinNT.So do NOT rely on what the Amazon web pages tell you regarding acceptable platforms. Instead, go to www.Microsoft.com/Games/ and look up the information yourself - at least Microsoft has the CORRECT information."
2,No TrackIR support. Decent game. Get IL2 instead.,"I got this game and played it for a while. Enjoyed it thoroughly.Then I got IL2: 1946, and this game seems like a total joke. I also got the head tracking kit: TrackIR, and this game will never support it.Get it if you are nostalgic, but if you want a fun realistic game, get IL2. You won't be disappointed."
2,Fun should not be this hard.,"Fun should not be so hard on your system. I liked the grahics to a point, but Microsoft needs to enlarge the print when listing the system requirements. Intially the action was pretty good, but the further I got into the game the harder it was on my hardware. The planes are too jerky when in combat. After a week, I went back to the GREAT...Fighter Squadron, the Screaming Demons Over Europe by Activision. Thanks."
2,Leakage problem in Kitchenaid food processor KFP740CR0,"I received this as a gift from my husband and was thrilled to see that it was a Kitchenaid, which has a `rep' for good products. However, they must have decided to offer low-end products to appeal to a larger demographic, because although I like this processor for a number of uses, the leakage problem at the base of the bowl is very disappointing and severely limits it usefulness. I understand from other posts I have read that it has to do with the center post being too short. Seems like such a small thing to change to make this a much better product. This is definitely a serious design flaw. If I had the money I would replace this product with something else."
4,Solid machine,"It was a choice between this and the Cuisinart Elite 12-cup machine. I decided to go with this one because it was a simpler design, without the gasket that many users were complaining was tough to clean. So far I've made pesto, slaw, sliced veggies and several sauces mixtures in this machine. It has all gone quite well and cleanup was very reasonable, not much different than my 3-cup mini-prep. The machine is fast, relatively quiet and rock-solid on the countertop.As long as the motor holds up long-term I think we have a winner."
2,"Powerful, but not much speed","This unit is sturdy and well made, but I've got a few strong likes and dislikes related to it.One of the things I like about it is the small insert bowl. It is really useful when you are dealing with small quantities and pretty much painless to clean. The base unit is also nicely sealed and easy to clean.Among the things I dislike somewhat are the poor liquid capacity of the main bowl. You can't have more than a couple of inches of liquid it because of the design of the collar. I've also found it useless for slicing.My biggest dislike though is the lack of speed (in RPM.) If you are trying to chop something that you really want cut up (barley groats for instance) this unit won't even damage them, much less chop them up. The blades revolve so slowly that small items are just moved out of the way, rather than being chopped."
5,Food Processor Review,"Received this lovely white food processor as a birthday gift. It's very heavy but manageable. Never had one before. I have been using it whenever I can, learning as I go. Love how it saves me a lot of time and effort chopping, slicing and shredding. If a soft cheese is not firm, it's a little messy to clean up. Tried the honey wheat bread included in the recipe book, but the bread did not rise. Think I know what happened and will try again. (Think I killed my yeast.) The processor did mix up the dough beautifully. It's best to at least rinse all the parts soon after use to ease washing later, especially if you don't have a dishwasher like me."
4,Great Machine,"I received it in 2 days which was a nice surprise when I was given a 5-7 day quote. It came well packaged so no damage was done. When people say it quiet they mean it. Our old processor could be herd 3 doors down. This one my wife can run it without disturbing the kids as they watch TV at low volume basically in the same room less than 10 feet away. It makes short work of anything she throws at it. The only problem she has so far with it is when she uses the smaller bowl, Some of the mix spills into the larger one which means she has to wash it as well. Not a big deal though considering she can dice/slice and shred all of our pizza toppings in under 5 minutes and wash both bowls where as doing it by hand took 45min to an hour.Love it recommend it to anyone, it's worth its wait in gold."
4,Nice product,"This is a nice food processor, and my first purchase of an expensive one. It works really well and comes with all the tools I need. The lid is a bit flimsy, and I feel I need to be careful handling it so it doesn't break. All the other parts seem very sturdy, so I don't know why the lid isn't as well. But it does the job very well and works great. Not too loud. Sometimes food does crawl up under the center of the S-blade which fits over the axis. It's a little hard to clean out, but all the other ones I've used had that same issue.Overall, this is a good product. I cook a lot, and it is definitely nice to upgrade to a unit that can handle the job. It's good."
2,quit working after 2 years,"I didn't use this food processor very often, but relied on it to make certain items. Now it has stopped working - I didn't ancipate having to replace it so soon. I received as a gift on my birthday. If it is such a quality machine, why doesn't it have more than a 1-year warranty?"
4,Good purchase,"I bought this mostly to grate carrots which it does great except for the last skinny little bits which end up between the blade and the cover. My dog gets those! I've used it once to knead dough which it did great, but may not knead a double batch very well. I look forward to trying other things with it."
3,Disappointed,"Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't all that impressed. Only 3 buttons, but maybe that's all that's really needed. The attachments are a bit weird to use and one of the main blades doesn't fit and I don't know why. I haven't been motivated enough to figure it out. Can't get them back into the holder as they are supposed to fit for storage either. I also really hate that all food processors leak if you have a liquid at speed or ""too full"". Why is it called a 12-cup if you can't put 12 cups in it without making a disaster of your kitchen?"
2,Slicing blade jams!,"Be careful! Using the slicing blade can cause the blade support to ""jam"" onto the driveshaft - making your processor a very heavy, unusable piece of junk! If you've had the product for more than a year - you're just out of luck. On calling them (their website asked that you call for this not uncommon problem), we were told it would be too expensive to fix and that we ""should just buy a new one""!We did.Of course, we bought a Cuisinart with a 3 year entire unit warranty."
5,Very pleased,"I was hesitant to purchase a food processor sight unseen however, I am extremely happy with this product and highly recomment the KitchenAid and a purchase through Amazon. Speedy delivery"
2,poor quality,"The switch on the bowl does not allow you to use the processor unless you wiggle it. Where do I get a new bowl? You pay this much for something it should work, I wasted $$$. Now I have to go through the BS and Cost to get a new bowl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't they test this stuff???"
3,Did what it advertised,"The book does cover differenty types of body language. I used it together with several other resources to put together a training program on customer service body language. If I could have used this book without referring to other resources, I would have rated 5 stars."
1,Doesn't put out the heat,"Our oven went out and since we will be remodeling the kitchen in the near future I didn't want to replace it for now. So I was looking for a counter top oven that could toast and bake. The smaller toaster ovens are not quite large enough to handle a decent pan size. This one had all the features I wanted and it looked good too. However I noticed that food was taking a very long time to cook and things like frozen fries or chicken tenders were not crisp like they were when our oven did work. I was following all the directions so I got an oven thermometor and realized that even on the very highest setting with the convection fan on Max, the inside temp. only reached a little over 300 degrees. Maybe I just got a lemon but I wasn't very happy with this so I brought it back."
1,A TOTAL waste of time!,"I've read more interesting novels written for 4th graders. It was trite, lacked any hint of historical facts, the dialogues were silly, the characters lacked substance, and so on.The author had me expecting that at some point Maria would say something like ""gee, golly.""I'd like a refund. Really."
4,Commanding,I just saw Mrs. Valentina Lisitsa in concert at the Amelia Island Chamber Music Festival and she was incredible. She stole the show! She did a duet with Lynn Harrell (grammy winner) and even he was awstruck. She is commanding and her husban is also quite talented. Together they are unbeatable duo. Highly recommended.
1,Pratically Pornographic,"I bought this book thinking, ""Oh, how cute two little pigs!"" Then I actually read the book, the girl pig, Rosalie, wants love and the boy pig, Truffle, wants to get lucky. The two pigs lay under the apple tree together. Rosalie's friends tell her it was bad to lay with the first pig that came along. Truffle's friends tell him he need to try more pigs to see which one he likes. The illustrations were beautifully drawn. This book should be recommended for ages 10-14."
3,"Good music, but NOT Sailormoon.","Let me tell you all that this is a GERMAN COMPILATION CD! This is not completely Sailormoon. The only Sailormoon tracks are 1-4, 18, and 19. The others are just German popular songs that they decided to tack on there in order to trick people into buying the CD because they *think* it's all Sailormoon songs.DON'T BE FOOLED!!! For example, if you saw a CD that said ""Avril Lavigne Best"", and had a picture of her on the cover, you would naturally assume the CD was full of Avril's songs, right? Well, that's what the German publishers are trying to get us to do. These are not, for the umpteenth time, all Sailormoon songs!!! If you really want to hear German Sailormoon music, look at the beginning and end of the CD. if you're interested in popular Eurodance music, check out the rest. It really isn't all that bad once you take the time to tell yourself that THIS IS NOT JAPANESE SAILORMOON MUSIC!"
5,Blows me away...,Yep.Better than Slint. Better than Shellac. Better than Tortoise. Etc.This is THE Indie album of the 90's.--Seth
5,AWEsome!!!,this is such a fun game. me and my brother play it on xbox live everyday. it is very addicting and i play it after school so it keeps me from doing homework early which is bad... the game is totally amazing although i have not yet trieed oout the essentials disk which is the bonus disk included
5,"Do NOT buy from: NorAm International Partners, Inc.","I purchased a ""like new"" copy of Halo 3 Limited Edition (in tin case with book and essentials dvd). The game had been shrink wrapped so it looked like new when I bought it but once I opened it I quickly realized it wasn't. The tabs that hold the dvd/game in place has at one time fallen off and someone had just stuck them in the top corner of the case (leaving the sticky residue exposed). Needless to say my Essentials dvd was COVERED in this sticky stuff. It still works with minor hiccups when played thanks to my 15 minutes of cleaning. The Game disc itself had a small dot of adhesive which came right off (lucky me). As far as I know the game disc works perfectly. Just beware when purchasing anything from: NorAm International Partners, Inc. (especially ""like new"" games)."
4,Xmas Game,"I read how the engineering for the package of this game is poor.The game was opened xmas day and the disk was indeed scratched. However the disk worked - so it was worth the $24.99 - I took the chance, all the stores had this game for $59.99."
2,PEGBOY IS NOT RAYGUN!,"Don't buy any pegboy cd's if you expect to hear Raygun II. Not even close. Not that Pegboy is a bad band, they are definitely worth a listen."
5,Seven Graduates!,"For those not old enough to remember Jane Roberts, she was a channel for an entity named Seth.Seth sent the info, Jane spoke it, her husband wrote it and eventually they, all three, put together a book called ""Seth Speaks"". It was very thick.Before Jane died, she took all that material and put it together in the three books comprising the story of Oversoul 7.What a delight!If you have any awareness at all, you can see so much of yourself in the story.The Oversoul 7 Triliogy is required reading by any who have an interest in the Metaphysical."
3,Jane Roberts Fans,"If you read Jane's Seth books - or Seth's Jane books - you will be at least a bit familiar with the concepts. Seven is in training as an oversoul and pops in and out of the earth lives of his charges. As always, the lesson is that you create your own reality."
5,Great Find,This book has many scenarios that I have applied in real life. Very easy to read and understand even for the newest SQL newcomer.
5,Great collectible,"I've been buying Josef birthday angels for my granddaughter since she was one year old. She can hardly wait to open this gift each year. She now has fourteen angels, and will be getting them for years to come. This is a wonderful collection to start for a child."
3,A dissappointing Six Sigma basic manual,"In purchasing this ""book"" (note that is a 3 1/2 by 5 1/2 inch, spiral bound), I was hoping to get a Six Sigma tool application guide for the office. What I got was a basic primer in Six Sigma (or quality programs) and its tools that quiet simply repeatedly points out that it can be used in the office setting. This approach may be fine for the office manager that has no knowlege of Six Sigma, but not so good for those people that already have knowledge of quality or Six Sigma. For example, one chapter is entitled ""What is Variation?"". In addition, there are beginner explanations of Fishbone Diagrams, Control Charts, DMAIC, Checksheet, Histograms, and Quality Teams to name a few. So I'd give a good recommendation for anyone that has very limited or no knowledge of Six Sigma. However, if you use quality tools or understand basic tenants of quality programs, this ""book"" will disappoint."
5,Stopped my snoring!,"This pillow stopped my snoring! I have a high end dual density foam temperpedic bed, which can make it difficult to align my neck. I tried half a dozen pillows until this one. Materials are good quality for the price. Be aware it will take a least a week for your neck and shoulders to get user to the pillow. This is becuase I was kinked up from the other pillows. Now I wont sleep without it! It allows me to sleep on both my side and my back, very comfortably and no more snoring. It does sleep a little warm as it is latex foam rubber."
3,pretty good but I stil have a backache,like it. Its okay still a bit wierd but i guess its good for my spine.
2,Too firm,"For someone who is about 5 feet tall, this pillow may still be too big. I have tried this and the child size. I think I prefer the child size. It seems to me that the foam used on the adult petite and the child size is different. The child size and the travel pillow seem to be made of softer foam.I use memory foam on my mattress, and after my shoulder sinks into the mattress pad, this pillow is too high for my head."
4,replacement,I have this pillow already from a chiropractor. I no longer go to that Dr and needed to replace my pillow because I was starting to get headaches again. I ordered a petite because the measurements fit that size. I was smaller then the pillow I had so I'm not sure if I should have gotten the bigger size or the Dr gave me the wrong one. It is firmer then my old one and I'm still glad I got it. Hopefully my headaches will go away! I'm a side sleeper mostly but had an injury that has my back a mess :)
3,My ears are too big I guess.,"I like the pillow it is comfortable and seems to help my neck. However, my ears must be either too big or stick out too far. The pillow cradles your head and pushed the ears back. After about 1 hour my ears HURT. I bought the large size but maybe I needed the extra large? If you have big ears make sure you go up a size or try another pillow."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"Advertised as reducing snoring and neck pain. Results were the exact opposite for me--more snoring, more pain. Used it for more than a week to give it a chance but it never got any better. Disappointed that product cannot be returned due to seller's policy."
5,At Last!,"I've been sleeping on cervical (neck roll) pillows for over 40 years. They all go flat. You have to move them when you turn over, put them on top of a thin regular pillow so that they're the right height. I've tried those rectangular pillows with the raised roll at the two ends. Uncomfortable. I got this pillow and slept 11 hours the first night--no trouble getting comfortable enough to go to sleep, no waking up around 2:00 feeling neck and shoulder pain, no soreness in the morning. This pillow is great. You can sleep on your side, roll to your back, and roll to the other side being fully supported at all times. I hope I live a while to enjoy it!!!!"
2,awkward,"This pillow is awful! Ive had for many years periodically using hoping that I would change my mind about. Its hard and awkward, Ive never been able to adjust to it..wouldn't recommend it at all."
3,Just OK,"Even after sleeping on the pillow for 3 weeks, it's still very uncomfortable. With a pillow like this that has different heights, if you roll around in your sleep, you'll be waking up every hour."
5,By far the best pegboy cd.,"I just absolutly love this band. the lead singers voice is wonderfully scratchy and rugged. A true pioneer of rock. Just kidding. Tis a pity, though that there are only ""fore"" songs....Just kidding once again. buy it or burn in the firey depths of hell!"
3,"Amusing, but no ""1066 and All That""","If you swallow the hype, and go in expecting this book to on a level with ""1066 and All That"" you will be disappointed. ""Chudo"" has failed to absorb the lesson that ""brevity is the soul of wit"", a philosophy that helps make ""1066 and All That"" the wonderful book it is. There are certainly humorous moments in this book, but there are also long stretches that try too hard without every really getting funny. The ""dictionary"" at the end has far more duds than truly funny entries. If you love Russian literature you should probably take a look at this book, but don't expect to fall out of your chair laughing very often."
2,"Can You Say ""Vanity Press""?","This book (whose actual author is the distinguished Slavist Gary Saul Morson) has a few very funny segments, but there's an awful lot of dross; the more I read, the less I liked it. It makes me sad to think that someone's real book was probably passed over in order to publish this hodgepodge of professorial doodlings."
5,"The wife liked it, a lot!","This ring was purchased as a gift for my ,soon to be, wife. She LOVES green so the ring was a hit with her. She is not a gemstone-type gal and I think it was her first diamond ring. She loves it and does not take it off very often."
5,Vocabulary Workbooks,"I am a reading tutor, working with children of all ages, to improve their reading and vocabulary skills. I enjoy working with the Scholastic 100 Words Workbooks at each grade level. After the vocabulary words are presented, they are used again and again in several different ways so that children can get accustomed to them. I am sorry this line of books is being discontinued."
2,Very poor documentation,"This product came bundled with my digital camera. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this product. There is very little documentation provided. The ""help"" function is not organized well and it is difficult to find answers to your questions. If you are new to digital photography, you will be frustrated with the program."
1,A rip off for cheap junkie Dresser,When I made my order I was hopping to recive a dresser with fullSize drawers not half. I am disgusted by the manufacture.
2,Something Corporate,SOMETHING CORPORATE IS THE BEST BAND EVER!!!! AND THIS CD IS NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN THE REST!!! BUT IT!!!
1,Fans are garbage!,"I purchased 2 of these through Amazon. Installed both in my computer. The fan in one failed within a day, the other failed the next day. The units themselves are solidly built of mostly aluminum with plastic at front and back, but the fans are garbage. The fans are necessary since the hard drive is a tight fit. However, since they will run 24/7, they need to be high quality, and they are just trash. Have to give kudos to Amazon - their return/refund process couldn't be simpler or easier and they are even paying return shipping. Thanks Amazon!"
2,"Great set, great price, lousy packaging","This box set is great except for one thing - the lousy packaging. The DVDs are stacked one on top of another. Granted there is a plastic divider separating the DVDs. There are three DVDs on the left side and two on the other.I am a serious DVD collector with nearly 2,000 in my collection and this kind of packaging is poor. I wished the company had packaged them better and charged a bit more them. That would have been fine. I take real good care of my DVDs."
5,Top knotch controler,"This Honeywell TH6220 Thermostat is the best I have ever owned. It is easy to program and adjust. Wiring this thermostat is easy unless you own a Lennox heat pump(which I do) The Lennox heat pump is a good machine but they don't use standard wiring schematics. A quick call to my Lennox dealer and resolved the problem. Even after all that, I've had this unit for a couple years with no problems. Great buy!"
5,"Whimsical artwork, entertaining story","This is a lovely tale of a geographically displaced maned wolf in search of a new identity and a human companion. A wonderfully absurd story follows, with a message of acceptance and friendship that does not pour on the usual smarmy platitudes. My almost-4-year-old son enjoyed the silliness of the dialog and the plentiful pictures; I appreciated the more-subtle-than-a-sledgehammer approach, which is a refreshing change from many popular children's books."
2,Better Options Available,"I had been using CoinManage for some time, it does have some nice features and is overall a decent piece of software. However, the lack of support gives you an indication of their ongoing interest in the software.I am now using Professional Coin Collecting Software (PCCS) and like it better and it is about half the price. Google it and you should be able to find the link."
3,Just another dictionary?,"While it's nice to have an ""official"" book around when playing, I've always found that any agreed-upon dictionary works just as well--if not better. Also it's a pain to carry a book around, so I'd rather just define the ""official"" dictionary with whatever dictionary is handy. And now with the internet, it's just as easy to check an online dictionary.Then again I play scrabble purely for amusement. Perhaps more hardcore players have valid reasons for needing an ""official"" Scrabble dictionary."
5,Scrabble Dictionary,My husband got me this for Christmas as I play Words With Friends and free Kindle games. I love the compact size so I can carry it in my purse and it has helped me locate words to solve my puzzles !! Completely satisfied.
3,okay,it was a little more used that i thought it would be. It was supposed to be gently used and it was older than i thought it would be.
1,Disappointed,"When I received the scrabble book, I looked it over and realized the dictionary was printed upside down and backwards, I'm sure others were printed the same!!! Disappointed with my purchase :("
2,"To many two-letter foriegn words, e.g. xi, xu, qi","I got this book because I was heading out on a month-long trip with some people I didn't know and they said they liked to play scrabble. I figured this would be the easy way to end all potential conflict between on this subject. It did that pretty well, but in part because we all did not like many of the words in this book.I was especially appalled with the words Xi, xu, qi and others like that that converted scrabble from a game of leveraging your vocabulary to one of remembering odd otherwise-useless trivia about strange words.The next time I play scrabble I am going to request that we either eliminate 2-letter words, or stick to ones that would have been in common english usage throughout the 20th century."
4,Excellent Source,"The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary is a perfect source for all those odd little words we don't encounter normally. Most importantly, it will help you win games."
4,Scrabble Game Much Easier and Faster,Great for all ages. Scrabble game is faster and the dictionary if easy for children to use. This dictionary promotes family scrabble games.
5,Big Print,Love my new Book!The print is big enough for old eyes to see!The new big print scrabble dictionary makes playing srabble fun again!
1,Silly book for silly people,"I grew up loving Scrabble. It was an excellent means of vocabulary development and learning, and an enjoyable one too. I credit the game with immersing me in the standard dictionaries of the day and preparing me for a career that involves extensive reading and rhetoric. No longer. As a result of this foolish dictionary that combs the world for obscure, foreign, and academically unrecognized two-letter words (qi and xu are not English words), foolish abbreviations and slang (enuf and za are not words at all) and silly onomatopoeia (mm and zzz are not words either), the game is no longer about vocabulary development, but about memorizing a list of non-standard letter combinations the meaning of which no one knows and about which no one cares.If you are a philologist, do not buy this book. It will stunt and warp your vocabulary development and strip a fine game of its original intent and value."
2,Not worth the wait!,I waited over 3 weeks for this book to be delivered when I could have gotten it for about the same price by going to a local book store to have it right away.
5,Wow! If you love Scrabble you will LOVE this Dictionary!,I love this new Scrabble Players Dictionary! The last few games I have played didn't have some of our played words in it and this one includes them. My old green paperback was so worn out and I am happy to replace it with this brand spankin' new one!Hambone's Wife
1,"I'm sorry, but Qwerty is NOT a word.","I'm sorry, but Qwerty is NOT a word. Neither is ""Herstory"" or a good number of other stoopid werds in this aggravating book that - unfortunately - somehow got isself endorsed by Scrabble officials. The definitions are slim and in many cases, nonexistent. I thought Scrabble was supposed to be played in English? well, there's lots of foreign words in here too. ""Barneys""?!?! That's a name. Furthermore, we've been playing Super Scrabble (twice the scores, twice the tiles, and twice the time - but BIG fun), and another aggravating ""feature"" is that this book does not contain any words longer than 8 characters - so you can fuggeddabout adding onto ""Further"" to make ""Furthermore"" - cause its not in here! This book gives me an Incredulity (11 letters - not in there!) socre of 75% and an Aggravation (also 11 letters - and not in there either!) score of 99%. Every time we play I want to do a Farenheit 451 on the damn thang!!!!"
5,An essential for every Scrabble player.,"If you are looking for two letter words or three letter words, or those words containing an ""X, J, Z"" or a ""Q"" without a ""U this is the place to find them. By far the MOST helpful Scrabble information yet!"
3,"Very, Very, Average","I was pumped when I first bought this book. I really thought it was going to help me focus my studies, but it didn't deliver. Although I passed the ACRC Exam this week, this book only helped to solidify my knowledge from the ACRC Book. I do not suggest you purchase it if you already have the ACRC Book (which is excellent, 5 stars)."
5,A very inspiring story,Alexandra is ranked #1 in the United States. She is the Kournikova of chess. I like this book very much.
4,A very interesting character,"Ms. Kosteniuk is a very interesting and complex person. When I read this book, I wasn't sure if she's promoting herself or chess. There're also misleading facts. She didn't become a GM at 14. She became a WGM at 14 which is a big difference. This is the sort of things that make people angry. Overall, it's an interesting book."
5,"Good stuff, USE AS DIRECTED","This product, when used correctly, is excellent. However you must read the instructions very carefully and DO NOT DEVIATE. If you are new to reef tanks do alot of research. This is not something you just throw in your tank and help the corals grow. This has a very specific use for certain types of corals, clams, and algae. I would also recommend the ""little dripper"" by zoo med. They are $10-15 depending on the size. the little dripper is a plastic bucket that has an ajustable drip valve. This is very important because the instructions say to add this to your tank at XX drops per min or sec. If you add it too fast you will have calcium clouds that can and will harm anything in your tank."
1,Worst Kitchen Garbage Can EVER,Save your money and get a different kitchen garbage can. My husband and I bought this about 5 months ago to replace a broken one in our kitchen. This thing has caused me so much stress. I absolutely hate it. It falls apart every day. It is so cheap and shouldn't even be on the market. I now have to buy another one to replace this one. This time I will read the reviews carefully to make sure we don't make the same mistake twice.
3,NOTHING NEW,"Why the author titled that book ""WICCA FOR MEN"" ist obvious: to get attention! There is not much new, that the experienced Wiccan/Pagan doesnt know. It introduces beginners to the craft, in an informative way,but its in some parts to preachy and its focus is to much on the practices of the ""Creations Covenant"". Beginners should gather more information from other authors like Grimassi and Cunningham to get a ""bigger picture""."
1,Hype to get men to buy a basic wicca book.,"I thought his book was about being a man in the Craft. I was wrong. It was about having opinions on the craft from a male point of view, and then plugging his tradition. I was expecting much more from it, like rituals based on the sacred connection that men can have, I wanted a book to help explain, from a male perspective, why men are involved in the Craft. I wanted a lot of things that were not delivered.If there were a quarter star, I would have rated it that. Save your $12.00 and go see a movie or two."
1,Just more rhetoric and misinformation,"I have been a student and practitioner of Wicca for over 10 years now. Recently, I had the misfortune to read ""Wicca For Men"" by AJ Drew.Not only is the book packed full of incorrect information he jumps to conclusions without any foundation for his assertions. It is obvious to me that Mr.Drew knows very little to nothing about Wicca, Magic or Metaphysics. What he did not guess at, it seems that he just re-worded the same old thing from other works. I am surprised that any publisher would print such dribble and I expect to see it on the shelves of the 1/2 price book shops soon. As to the ""tradition"" he mentions, it appears to be made up on the spot to promote his dubviuos motives. In other words, pass this one by for a book that you can learn something from."
4,China Through Western Eyes,"The Chan's Great Continent by Jonathan Spence is an entertaining book that looks at a culture (China) through the perspective of another culture (European and American) over many centuries. It begins with Marco Polo and ends in the twentienth century. It is fascinating to watch the image of China change over time, not to meet reality but to serve the ends of the viewer. This brief study is a wonderful way to see how image can be and is manipulated by the observer. This book draws on the accounts of literture, missionaries, historians, politicians, travelers, merchants and many others in its eclectic ride through the centuries. It is both knowledgable and entertaining and worth a read."
3,Dancing up a storm,"My daughter has had lots of fun with this... it can be pretty challenging for the 'rhythm impaired,' but with two dance pads its a good way to get you and your kid in motion. Be sure the attach the no-slip pads if you want the pads to stay put."
1,"This ain't Grand Magus this is Face To Face ""Shoot the Moon""","I just received this CD in the mail and guess what? This ain't Grand Magus! This is Face to Face ""Shoot the Moon: the defenitive collection""Big surprise!"
1,Do not buy this book: waste of money!,"Unless you need ideas for making flashcards for memorizing vocabulary and think this is a clever ""game"", do not buy this book. It is a waste of money. Fortunately I bought the Kindle edition and was able to return it. It is unfortunate, because the Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers usually turn out to be good value. This book just contains a lot of meaningless games that are found in the most basic of textbooks or websites (usually for free)."
4,Pretty Delightful,This is not like any other candy. It is soft and the flavor is more from the nuts than sugar. This Turkish Delight was pretty good but bulkier than other turkish delights. I wish it was in smaller pieces.
4,Saved my lungs,It works great but I feel I should have bought a larger bellow. I would not return this because it looks like it will hold up and I don't use it daily.
2,Star of David Necklace,"I agree that these Artazia pieces are unique and very ""girly."" However if you're looking for something that embodies a bit more of the spirituality of this ancient sacred symbol, you might want to look elsewhere. I hate to say it, but these Artazia pieces look a bit like the Star of David in a ""tarted up"" version.I prefer the elegant, gorgeous Star of David pendants by Israeli designer David Weitzman. (For more info check my profile.) These are modern reinterpretations of the powerful Star of David symbol, yet they still carry an amazing spirit of esoteric beauty and religious wonderment. Whatever your faith or ancestry, his pieces will inspire and uplift you."
3,won't last a year?,"I bought this back in April 2008 along with a Bosch 41924 wiper blade for my 2000 Sienna. I was happy until I took my ride in for emissions inspection and it failed because the rubber on the wiper blades was splitting - after eight months of use. Maybe the emissions station sliced it. Who knows, but now I have to fiddle with them again to pass emissions. Not likin' than."
4,nice red soft color,it was a little smaller than I expected but perfect for a gift. it gets pretty hot when you pour hot tea into little cups. otherwise looks great.
1,Not accurate,"So much of this book just wasn't accurate. The author it seems was in such a hurry to get this book out that it wasn't all correct. After studying this case for a college project, this book was a waste of money."
5,good stuff,"I've bought a few Prevention fitness DVDs and found them uninspiring, a bit too much of the same old same old. I got this one because it had Lara Hudson's name on it, and I like her - she uses innovative takes on classic pilates moves,. her cueing is excellent - she gives you time to set up and explains the moves without wasting precious time - and she's pleasant without being loud or overly perky... no whooping, ever - thank gods! (Yes, I am super fussy..... )This is yet another goody, and the only Prevention keeper. Afterwards, I felt muscles I hadn't felt in a while. There's a floor routine and a standing routine, both make use of the (included) band, but one modifier uses weights. Simpler AND more advanced moves are also demo'd. The whole routine comes to just under an hour. You can of course split it up. I enjoyed it, and it's going into my regular rotation.I hope to see more DVDs by Lara Hudson."
5,Surprised,"I have long been a fan of fantasy and science fiction but usually avoid those that I feel are ""young adult"". So, when my niece coerced me into reading this book, I was delighfully surprised by how good it actual was.The characters are well-developed and portray a morality that has been missing in the genre since the Wizard of Oz.The authors pull no punches to suit the politically correct. This is a tale of good versus evil, of tenderness and brutality, of loyalty and betrayal. But the scenes, while very well detailed, are not filled with the gore or the kitsch that is the trap of all new authors.This is a classic story in the classic sense.Buy it, read it, enjoy it. I did."
2,Extremely over-rated,"I usually don't find the energy to write a review, but after staring dumbfounded at the glowing reviews for this book I felt I had to, if only in order to spare another reader.This book is far, far from being great. In fact, it is incredibly bad. With its clumsy dialogue, barely serviceable plot, one-dimensional (ok, is there one exception?) characters and just plain bad writing, it is definitely not worth either the time or the money I spent on it.I make no claim that children will not like it. However I do take exception to the claim that discerning adults will enjoy it as well.If you enjoy fantasy written for children read The Phantom Tollbooth, the Oz books by L. Frank Baum, The Treasure Seekers, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, the Narnian chronicles, and a host of other marvelous tales that can truly be enjoyed by both the young and the young at heart.Skip King Fortis the Brave."
2,Valet chair,Was very disappointed in product. Was all in pieces and missing holes needed in construction.My husband used language not heard since he was in Navy {many colorful sailor terms}.He had to drill holes that were not there and use different bolts as some included wereso inferior. Made in China {what's new}.Only good thing was the wood was decent and looked in okay condition.I would not buy from this source again however.
4,A must read!!!,"This book helped me while dealing with memories of my own past hurts. I had no idea that I had so many blank spots (periods of time that I could not remember things.) This helped me fill in those blanks, face my hurts...and get on with my healing! An awesome book!!!"
5,Decorating for those with more creativity than money!,"This book is full of wonderful, artistic ideas; each page better than the last. I wistfully moved from an old, 1920's bungalow into a brand-spankin'new townhome and have referenced Found Style many times for ideas. This book isn't for the cookie cutter, Christopher Lowell set; it's for creative people who prefer to have homes that reflect who they are artistically. I don't want my home to look like a Pottery Barn showroom. I want to create a comfortable and cozy, yet clever environment that you just can't find at a home decor store. Just as the name implies, the book imparts creative ideas for found objects, salvage and thrift store finds. For those of us who love frequenting flea markets and thrift stores, Found Style is the perfect book for giving us ideas on how to use our finds in clever and unique ways. It has enabled me to turn my suburban, builder beige townhome into something distinctive with vintage character."
4,anarchy CHINA!!!,"Hilarious all-girl punk band from Beijing!this is a compilation of their first two albums in China.""Ass Hole, I'm Not Your Baby!"""
4,Common sense and easy to understand.,"I was very impressed with this book. It was easy to read and easy to understand, but the best part aboout it was how much sense it made. It all seemed so basic why didn't anybody think of it before? I highly recomend this book for anybody who does not have complete control of their eating."
1,not worth it,"Looks cheap and it feels cheap. Looks way better on the picture then it is.The leather is much too rough and the stitching on the corners feels uncomfortable. Unless you have a $10 watch or something, get a better band."
3,Its ok,This strap will do the job and is made of leather. It is a little stiff and takes some breaking in
1,Makes me sick,What the %#&k! That is all i can say. Too bad I can't give it zero stars. Horrible just horrible. Bitchin songs are ruined by this CD.
5,Mac case,This a great case. Roomy and the strap is stretchy and comfy and being a woman with a small shoulder it actually makes a HUGE difference.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my mother, who enjoys paint-by-number and pencil-by-number kits, but when it came I was so disappointed in it that I did not even give it to her. Although Thomas Kinkade's lovely painting is provided as an example, the actual colors in the kit do not in any way resemble them. This kit should have at least 20 different pencil colors in order to approximate the original in any way. Obviously, a pencil-by-number kit is not going to look just like an original Kinkade, but when you are trying to replicate a painting with hundreds of colors in it by using only 8 colors, what you end up with is something entirely different. You will not even recognize the Kinkade painting in this one when it is done. If you have your own set of pencils and want to improvise on the colors, you could do much better with the set, but be warned that the paper it comes on is not very sturdy either."
4,Must Have,It looks great and lets everybody know who we cheer for and expect to win the super bowl next year.
2,Product was cheaply made and not as described on website.,Product was poor quality and not as described on website. Not pleased at all and will not be giving this item as a gift.
4,A Terrific Little Movie,"In the wrong hands this could have been another cutesy look at life and love among the yuppies, instead Hope Davis and a stellar cast (with a virtual but hysterical cameo by Philip Seymour Hoffman)and a good script make this a thoroughly enjoyable watch. Recently dumped (again) by Hoffman's character, Davis is depressed & angry at the bottom feeders she is forced to endure on endless blind dates culled from the respondents to a personal ad placed by her witty, vivacious, successful mother, played to perfection by Taylor Holland. In this parallel story telling technique - On the other side of the bar is Alan Gelfant, who is just a guy trying to make a career leap from plumber to marine biologist. Alan has his own bag of troubles - loan sharks, dopey yuppy brother and a persistant suitor, who just doesn't give up. A really fun movie."
4,A Quiet Romantic Comedy,"I bought the soundtrack long before I saw the movie, and just about wore the CD out. It's a must-have for any fan of bossa nova. I bought the movie once I saw it, as well. It's a good pick for a rainy day under the blanket. Hope Davis is a pleasure to watch, and the plot is subtely funny. It's not a showy movie, but a little slice of life with a marvelous soundtrack."
3,"Cute , but not the best .","This is really a sticker , not a Gel type skin . It is hard to put on and the corners will pop up and peel if you are not careful to smooth them out really good . It looks very cute on the phone , does cover it well and gives some protection . I was disappointed in how thin it is . If you drop your phone , forget it . I rather have the Gel skin anyday to this .If you just want your phone to look cute and have a steady hand to apply this you will like it .. if you are looking for something a little more sturdy and easier to apply get a gel skin or a good case instead ."
3,It was good,It was just okey because we cancelled our order and it was a mistake in our part. They responded positively and it was good.
2,Low quality.,"Not a great product. About a month after I got it, the plastic started cracking and peeling so the wiring started showing through on the ends. The cord just plugs into my laptop which sits on my desk and doesn't move. The router is in another room so I needed a long run. Even if I were moving the laptop you would expect this cord to last longer. I still use the cord since I paid for it but the quality is very low."
2,Short changed.,I ordered 50 feet and unfortunately I was shortchanged about 4 feet. I had to resort to buying a connector and hook up a shorter piece of CAT5 cable to hook up my computer to the modem in a different room. The construction was good and at least it works so there is that as positive.
4,Great Value,"Works as advertised, no problems, can't beat this for the price! I used it to hook up my Xbox 360 up to my router because I didn't want to spend the $100 for the wireless adapter."
1,not what i expected,"Well, all i wanted was longer cable for my xbox360. The length was perfect, all white(matches my xbox), I was ready to jump on XBOX live. I turned it on and lo and behold- it does not support it. I'm not sure if it was the hotel connection or the cable, but i got a notice that the xbox could not use it. I hooked my laptop to it and it worked fine so who knows. Either way, if you want it for an xbox360, you might want to be aware of what happened to me and do your research."
5,Don't spend alot of money on other cables!,"I purchased this cable to run to my Blu-Ray player in order to access BD-Live content and update firmware. I had to run the cable almost 50 feet because my Blu-Ray player does not have built-in wireless. This cable was the most cost effective way of connecting the player to my router. The cost was just right and it was shipped pretty quickly. It does ship in a plastic bag in an envelope, but I had no problems with that. Don't spend more than you need to, BUY THIS CABLE!"
3,I Was Wrong -- This Is A 5 STAR GAME,"I had a knee jerk reaction to this game that was negative when I bought it because at first I thought that under the Skirmish - Annihilate mode it was too hard to beat even on the easy setting -- I was wrong -- after playing a bit more, trying new strategies, and using pause and the map at the lower left, I realize how great this game is. It's totally fun and challenging, and that's what RTS games are supposed to be all about. I love this game. My only small complaint is that I wish the guide was a bit more fleshed out. Great Game!!!"
5,Company of Heroes,"I never could get into WWII games, but company of heroes is awsome. I love the fact the AI allows your troops to seek cover under fire and troop movements are tactical."
1,Shameful Knockoff,Inferior animation to Lodoss War- characters totally out of sync with original series - dont even recognize each other! - What a shame - Why not follow the original series? Record of Lodoss War was a winner - this series is not! I highly suggest renting before buying....
3,Cargo Liner should not shift,"I purchased this so boxes would not slide around. It does a great job of that. The problem is, The whole liner shifts from front to back popping up over the lip of the trunk."
1,"Contains shellfish, NOT on label","Be aware if you are allergic to shellfish ...this contains shellfish and it is NOT on the label. Also the VegiCaps are actually animal derived so if you thought they might be vegetarian friendly, they are not. Deceptive labeling, and dangerous as well. This product should be pulled until they are properly labelled. Will never buy another Nature's Way product.Additionally, Spent some time in the local health food store checking out other brands of this product. Every other brand has warnings about shellfish. This is from the chondroitin ingredient. There are non-chondroitin pills you can buy. They also sold the Nature's Way and were unaware of the labeling problem. I pointed it out to them, and they removed it from the shelf."
4,Hydraplenish Hyaluronic,This product is helpful for joint pain. It still has not beenlong enough for me to do a thorough appraisal.
1,Not suitable for vegans and vegetarians,"I was so excited to get this product because I had heard a lot of good things about hyaluronic acid. This brand seems to be pretty cheap and also it specifies that it supports skin health. However, I realized after I purchased it that it is made from animal source(Hydrolyzed collagen).So if you are vegan or vegetarian this is unsuitable for you. Even though it has vegetable capsule, it is derived from animal source so beware...."
2,Okay...,"This book is not a good book. As I am the first person to review this, feel free to criticise my comments to death. Emily Rodda does not get you involved in the plot or the characters, and it is unnesiserily bloody. As for the plot, come on! Tamora Pierce's books are soooooooo much better in all aspects. I felt as if I was watching a really bad action movie with violence everywhere when I read this book.I would not reccomend this book at all if you like quality things. I was really sorry that I wasted my money on this."
5,This shampoo is the best,I've used this shampoo for years. Its the best for dry hair and takes care of all the itches and dry skin flakiness.
5,My favorite set!,"I received this set as a gift last Spring, and it has been in constant use ever since! It is by far the favorite set in my collection. The tea pot stays hot for quite a while on its own, however I also bought a tetsubin warmer (it can take me an hour or two to finish the pot at times). The tea cups are iron and get very hot I so highly recommend purchasing saucers, as well as a bamboo spoon/stirrer to protect the interior enamel. No rust problems when washed as instructed, and porcelain enamel has held up well. This is a GREAT value! I've seen sets like this price upwards of $150 in stores!"
1,poor product- do not suggest it for kids,"Item took a longer than usual time to arrive. The shipping/postage cost more than the item cost-very deceptive.Frankly, IF the postage was so much- it shold have been sent overnight-it took far too long. The product should have listed the items and number of items in the case-not a total number of 29 unknown contents..Really, not the best for little kids-more info should have been available and more items . The packet is NOT recommended for either little kids nor for adults to get little kids comfortable in immediate first aid or for camping or hiking needs. It is NOT recommended for school bag, bike bag, etc.-yes it is small-but poorly packed and should have an easier means to open the tough plastic box for little kids to access the items. All in all, I do not recommend."
4,Great For Decks,"This product is excellent for prolonging the life of wood deck framing and exterior stair stringers. Fasteners, especially nails, will split the framing top edge as they are driven in. Water gets into these splits (everywhere there is a fastener) and accelerate the rotting process. If the water freezes, the splits only become larger and eventually your fasteners will come loose. This product prevents that from happening. Install it on top of deck framing before nailing or screwing down the deck boards. Stair stringers have exposed end grain after they are cut for tread boards. Water damage occurs very quickly to end grain. If you cover the stringers with this flashing tape before installing treads, no water damage will occur at all. The sticky tar side goes against the wood, creating a permanent seal. The smooth side goes UP. Fasteners driven through it do not break the seal. It can be easily cut with a utility knife."
4,Audiovox Personal CD Player,"I received the Audiovox CD Player as a gift. I am completely thrilled with the design of the product, a cool blue hard-plastic see-through case (like the iMac!). But I am more impressed with the audio quality of the CD. The audio has depth and clarity, and offers a 40 second electronic skip protection that allows for smooth and continous play ..... even while I am working out on my stairmaster. I highly recommend this CD player for quality and neat design."
2,Not a good product,"Within the first 2 hours of use, the anti-skip broke. VERY frustrating. Would not buy again."
5,An excellent collection of some rarely heard selections,"While the Concerto in C and even the Triple concerto and Fantasia are sometimes heard in the concert hall, on eof Beethovens most beautifully experimental works is his choral fantasy. He originally conceived the piece as a trial to insure that the combination of a chorus and an orchestra in a non-liturgical context would ""work."" He included rather dramatic and extensive nearly candential solo piano portions to make the work a smorgasboard of timbre and performance oppertunity. It is thanks to the seamlessness of the fantasy that we have the great 9th Symphony to enjoy. A fantastic resource for any student of Musicology"
2,They were huge,My husband liked the quality but he wears a 9.5 shoe size and he could have fit two feet in one sock.
3,soft socks,"My husband has trouble bending over, so he appreciates that these go on easily. They are so soft, however, that he has trouble keeping them on.Still, he would buy them again because they are so comfortable"
5,wiper blades,These Bosch Wiper blades fit our car perfectly. they are a good deal to a great price. high quality item.
3,good fit and close to OEM,"Fit perfectly into the funky lever/joint on my Audi A4 (2004, 1.8 Quattro). Installation was fast, easy, and only slowed by me being careful to not snap the the plastic locking lever"
4,Excellent system for a great price,I would give this system a five star rating except that we really love the shuffle feature and this system does not have it. But other than that I highly recommend this! It has great sound and it holds 5 cds! The stereo system this new one is replacing in my house only holds 3 cds and it cost me almost the same price as this audiovox system! Enjoy beautiful sound and the chance to have 5 cds ready to play!
2,Worked at first but not long enough,"It was seemingly a great deal, an all-in-one color laser printer for less than $500. Wrong.After about a year and a half, it started to get flaky, jamming for no reason. Later, the black tones started streaking regardless of fresh toner, test sheets, etc. Every time the printer has an issue, it sits there and ""thinks"" for a LONG time before it even tries to feed again. So troubleshooting is interminable.At this point, it is useful only as a scanner (very modest quality). I do like the way it integrates into the network, otherwise it would be only one star.Yet again a disappointment from Samsung."
2,UNRELIABLE,I have had this machine for about three years. I purchased it for a home busineass. It took months to get it to work at all and has never been dependable. To say 45% would be generous. I am extremely annoyed that I spent $500 and had to do most of my printing on a smaller HP Photosmart because this one has constant paper jams even when there is no jam. The ultimate insult is they have my money and I am going to buy another machine to do the same thing I paid Samsung for. It will not be a Samsung of any sort.
3,Marginal,"The color rendition of photographs was never very good. The machine seemed to use a lot of ink in a short period of time. The print quality was ok. The instructions were poor and I found myself calling Customer Support a lot. Although they were responsive, they were not able to resolve my setup issue. I have a dial up connection, an answering machine and the fax machine on the same line. CS was unable to figure out how to make all three things work. If the machine was configured to a fax setting, the answering machine wouldn't pick up. If the machine was configured to an answering machine setting, the fax machine wouldn't work. After (2) days of trying, they said they couldn't resolve the problem and that the machine may be broken. I don't think the machine was broken, I do think that this condition was never considered in it's design."
1,Avoid This Printer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this printer more than a year ago, and am very disappointed.The print quality for photos is awful, it jams frequently, and the ink is so...expensive to replace. I am planning to just get rid of it. My inkjet does a superior job compared to this laser. I have had the inkjet 5 years, and it is amazing ! HP Desk Jet!"
2,A World of Butterflies,"Nice book, however the majority of photos are of specimens rather than living butterflies in a natural setting.Text is well thought out. Nice coffee table book."
3,Not bad for an inexpensive FRS,"Units have nice features, are easy to understand and use. Units were used on hunting trips. They offered good receptioon and transmission in wooded terrain. Units worked well with other name brand FRS units. My complaint was battery life, 3AAA's didn't last long with constant transmitting and cold weather, one hour to five hours was normal battery life. If a unit would'nt transmit it would still receive though. Battery level icon never changed."
1,Unreliable machine prone to early breakdowns,"As someone who burns DVDs fairly often, I learned years ago to avoid Memorex blank discs. The brand always seemed to include more than the usual number of bad discs (coasters) per package, so I refrained from buying any.Despite misgivings, I went ahead and purchased this DVD burner. For roughly three months, my fears were unfounded as it performed without a hitch. In the fourth month, problems started to creep in, with more and more discs being improperly burned. Then, at the end of the month, the machine just gave out entirely.My advice is not to waste time and money on this machine. If my experience is duplicated, and I see no reason why it wouldn't be, it is subject to a higher failure rate than similar burners from other makers.This DVD burner is not recommended."
1,Over heating and unable to recharge,"I bought vaio pcg-grv680 in nov 2003. Within few months, I noticed that cooling fan was always on, i contacted sony customer service they told me that i had a set up problem.Since last 6 months, laptop was getting overheated and crashed so many times. Lately, i cannot recharge battery, it seems to me that due to heating, connection melt down. I tried to contactSONY customer service, it is worst. I wasted $2000. I willnot recommand anyone to buy VAIO laptop."
5,Blind dove,"I have a blind dove and this cup is excellent for him, it's big enough for him to dip his beak into it and the cover keeps the seeds clean and prevents them from scattering all over the place. Sturdy construction too, fits easily on my cage which is usually difficult to attach things to. Great for larger birds and parrots and the company I bought it from (Global Pets) is excellent, super fast shipping and great packing."
2,It doesn't work like I thought it would,I bought this item in hopes that it would keep my cockatoo from making a big seed mess. It doesn't help at all...
5,Don't move those Boundaries!,"Boundaries in Dating is an excellent book for those who wish to enter the dating scene and form healthy relationships. It is for those who have never dated, and for those who are tired of failed relationships, and for those people who are happily dating, but want to continue towards excellence. When I began reading this book, I realized how many times I had compromised my personal boundaries, and how each time I did that I was plagued with guilt. It was a pattern that this book helped me to recognize. I have now taken ownership of my part in dating problems. I have also learned that the other person has problems that only he can fix. As a result of reading this book, prayer, and listening to the Holy Spirit, I am able to discern more quickly whether a particular person is whom I desire to spend time with. Christians will find this book especially helpful because of the spiritual approach, but I recommend it to others as well."
3,Good Info,Am planning to teach teenage girls about dating and keeping yourself pure for marriage and this book had a few good ideas and feel I can incorporate into my teaching.
5,nice lens,Nice 2.8 lens for the money. very sharp pictures. recommend it. Not too heavy and gives versatility.The price is right.
2,Get something better,The auto focus system is too noisy and very inaccurate. I guess the image quality is not bad but the auto focus is so bad its a deal breaker.
5,Great lens over 18-55 kit lens,"Just got my lens in the mail. My props to amazon for getting it to my house overnight, before 9am on saturday. Haven't been able to take a lot of pics yet, but my overall impression is this lens is much more sturdily built than the 18-55 kit lens I got with my T2i. I know people have complained about noisy and slow focusing. I haven't owned a USM lens yet, but compared to the kit lens, this lens focuses much faster, and honestly it doesn't seem any noisier than the kit lens. It's a tad quieter if anything. With the few pictures I've taken so far I'm very impressed."
5,"Far superior to the kit lens, great for the price","I bought this lens primarily as a replacent for the Rebel XTi's 18-55 mm kit lens. Since I received it I've used it to take about 300+ photos, and I am very impressed. The majority of those pictures have been long exposure/small aperture in very low light (night), and I can only say good things. I've experienced very little vignetting, distortion, or chromatic aberration, and would take this over a comparable Canon any day. Even with portraits that I've taken at f/2.8, I have seen little to no negative lens effects. As a student in Boston, price is always paramount, and this lens has not disappointed. I've definitely gotten my money's worth."
2,Average at best,"The autofocus noise is intolerable. I thought I wouldn't mind, but it was very annoying.The image quality was mixed. It was able to resolve quite a bit of detail, but I found the focal plane to be odd shaped and the focus accuracy with my DR was much lower than any of my other lenses. Often the images it produced had far different quality from side to side. I couldn't figure out whether this was due to focus issues or a lens abnormality.People who like this lens either are very forgiving or got a much better copy. I don't have time to sift through multiple copies to find one that is acceptable."
4,Tamron 17-50mm,"This is an all around great lens. And for the money, it can't be beat. I'm using it on a 7D and I shoot mostly video. Manual focusing is a little tough to work when I'm capturing live footage but I get that it's a still camera and made primarily for people that enjoy using the auto focus. Other than that it's a nice lens. Nothing about it feels cheap. I hope it'll last me a very long time."
4,Excellent Product,"The LaCie external mobile hard drive worked as advertised. Plug it in one of your USB ports and it is ready to download your files for protection against hard-drive failure. I had a mirrored backup (Intel) drive fail on my Dell PC and spent three frustrating weeks on the phone and e-mails with Dell trying to repair it. Gave up and order the LaCie. My work was backed up in less than ten minutes. One especially large video file produced a ""can't handle"" message, but I solved that with one call to Product Support."
2,POORLY WRITTEN AND POORLY RESEARCHED,"I gave this one two stars simply for the vague effort put into it. Overall the books is rather poorly written, source documentaiton is almost nonexsistent and to be quite frank, the writing style is beyond boring. Having lived here in the Ozarks for all of my life (well over 60 years) and having accomlished some modest research in this area myself, I was very, very disappointed in this work. Actually, I am not at all sure if this author ever lived here, or even visited. If you are interested in this area of study, I suggest ""Ozark Magic and Folklore"" by Vance Randolph. This is a older book, but well worth the search to find it. I Do not recommend this work."
4,This is a book I give as a gift.,If you want to be encouraged ....read this book!!!I have given this to several friends. We all needencouraging and this book does it well.
4,Very good but not the best,"In my humble opinion, the best Tibetan Bells or bowls cd I have heard is Benjamin Iobst's ""7 Metals"". It is easier to listen to.Although I like Becher's offering - don't get me wrong, I do own it and play it - I just think that Iobst's is more listenable and has a better meditative quality. Sometimes Becher's sound patterns seem redundant and almost annoying.I also highly recommend the crystal bowl offerings of the ""Crystal Voices"". These have an even higher vibration, that is a more spiritual/mental effect on me, but they too can be annoying if you are not in the mood for them.For Tibetan Bowls, I have heard about 8 different cd's and I consider Iobst's the best. But Becher's isn't bad."
2,Decent Player,"This CD player is nothing great. It eats up batteries like a madman, it skips routinely with the anti shock on. The plus is that it comes with a complete car kit. Again, only buy this if you are looking for a cheap player. Go with the more dependable sony."
4,"Murder by Sound, Again","The book was a fun read, and I guessed the means long before it was revealed, because it was in fact the ""means"" used in the Dorothy Sayers classic, The Nine Tailors. In the Sayers novel, the ""murder by sound"" was unintentional, but appears to have caused the same cadavaric spasms. I kept waiting for Poppy to bring up Sayers' use of that method."
3,"Overpriced Lifesaver, once it's been formatted","This device is certainly a life saver when it comes to storing large files on a flash-based drive. It can be almost critical to some to have one of these devices, yet drawbacks remain: The software is terrible, and the drive is better completely wiped clean. The price miffed me, but 2 gigs is an irreplacible amount of storage to have lying around. If you are not a serious worktype, I would suggest a larger capacity mp3 player, such as an iPod. This device is certainly much easier to use than an iPod for storing data, and more convenient as well. If Iomega shaved $50 off the price, it may be worth it.Grab one of those new sexy black nanos. At least then you can listen to the music you store on your removable drive."
5,the best autobiography i ever read!,"man this book is great, dmx is one of my fav. rappers, before i bought this book i just didn't know most of the things he was talking about, but after reading this you just get everything he says. this book has eveything his been through in his life, from when he was a kid, coming up doing crime, how he got into rap, and how he struggled to get a record deal.anyway even if you don't like X that much i'd still suggest you to buy this book.PeaceOUTLAW"
4,Wonderful Fifties Imagery!!!,"Really nice hard cover book with images that truly transport you to a more romantic time when Hawaii was ""the"" place to travel! I haven't figured out yet though why the Outrigger and Duke's Canoe Club are not featured. Duke's may be a tourist trap now, but to me, the ambience is perfectly tropical. Overall this book a really nice trip back to (from what I hear) better days!"
4,Is a great story.,I really very much doubt that his aim was to demean the gun. It was a great story and that's all it was probably meant to be. Contrary to clearly popular belief- the only agenda that most writers have is to write a good story. I like guns a lot and I also like this book a lot because I am not narrow minded. You other commentators should think about your own obvious bias before you start accusing someone else of bias.
1,Tripe,This book is a piece of anti-gun propaganda. The story is simplistic. The only point of which is to show that guns are evil. If your a member of Handgun Control Inc. you might like it otherwise move along. Nothing worth reading here.
1,a different book,"This book was terrible. There was no point to it. Its just about a gun that has been owned by many people. Gary Paulsen is one of my favorite authors, but I dont know how he could have written such a bad book. Overall I hate this book and I dont recomend anybody reading it."
1,Not worth the time it took to read it.,"I did like the description of the making of the gun, I thought my son might like this book because of that. Then the propaganda starts.The people who like the gun or any guns are portrayed as stupid, callous individuals , (obviously never to have checked the gun to see if it held a ball was not to bright.)Fear mongering (your neighbor could have a gun on his wall that will kill you), This book is aimed at preteens and teens.I will not be buying it ,(read a library copy), or recommending it to my son or anyone else.I didn't realize Gary Paulson was into propaganda.The cryptic ending where the gun is almost human waiting to inflict more harm was pretty annoying."
2,It was pretty good!,"As a 13 year old, I thought The Rifle was a good book. It was difficult for me to read and understand because it had too many details. It was difficult for me to follow along because there was too many things happening at one time. The book taught me not to leave a gun loaded because accidents can happen. It also taught me all the different parts of the rifle. At the end of the book I was really shocked because I didn't expect it to end that way"
5,As powerful as a shot to the heart!,"Before I started working as a bookseller, I never bothered with young adult literature, after all, what did that have to do with me - an adult? But then I discovered writers like Gary Paulsen. This is among his most incredible works. The reader follows the 'life' of a lovingly crafted weapon, from before the days of the American Revolution when a rifle is 'born', to the present. The intersection of this rifle and one young boy is as real as the stories one reads in the paper everyday, and the description of what could have been completely takes the reader's breath away. If you haven't read any of Gary Paulsen's books, you have missed some absolutely incredible literature - try The Rifle, Nightjohn, A Soldier's Heart, Hatchet, or his wonderfully funny and poignant My Life In Dog Years. I have my fingers crossed that Mr. Paulsen will continue to provide readers with the gift of his stories for many years to come."
4,A hard to follow but good book!,"A sweet rifle thats loaded and goes through tons of generations? Thats exactly right, and that reminds me a book where a little horse went through a ton of generations. I loved this book from begining to end!"
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!!!,"I had this Mr. Coffee model for about a year before it stopped working. So - silly me - I went and bought a similar one to replace it. It stopped working after 2 months. It STARTS to brew, then prematurely stops. I think it has something to do with crappy electronics in the faceplate. Mr. Coffee coffeemakers are not what they used to be. And this model is a piece of junk, in my humble opinion. BEWARE!"
4,I'm glad I FOUND this,"I'm nosy - not in a malicious way, but others' yearnings, secrets, and day-to-day lives fascinate me. The items documented in ""Found"" range from hilarious to heartbreaking, and it is a fascinating glimpse into human nature. It's a great bathroom read. It's also reassuring to know other people like reading crumpled notes they found on the library floor or gazing at pictures pressed between the pages of an old book."
3,Not in color,"The book is, of course, funny and interesting, but I was disappointed when I opened it and found that there was no color inside."
5,A note from the author,"I am of course biased: I wrote this textbook exactly as I needed it for my courses. But why write a new textbook on signals and systems? There are at least 20 out there covering more or less the same material... In a nutshell: Value to the student and engineer. I had two objectives in preparing this book: (1) clarity to enhance learning (by presenting one concept at a time, providing detailed solutions, using lots of figures and learnware applets, etc.) and (2) low cost to the student. I think (2) has been achieved, and I'll let the readers judge (1)!"
2,Recapture the Wonder,"Being an avid reader of this type of book, I didn't find anything new in this one. Most of the concepts were things I was aware of."
3,good protection not great function,Its a solid case and protects everything but the buttons the USB jack and the headphones Jack. But it tends to crowd the buttons so if you have large fingers you may have a problem using it. The screen cover is my biggest problem. It scratches to easily and had one on it after just putting it in my bag. The screen also has a lot of glare. It's impossible to use in the sun. But the belt clip for it is ok. It's removable and and swings freely. But it does feel a little flimsy. It has a little kick stand for watching videos if you want to prop it up. Works ok but again a little flimsy.
3,Not bad,"The kickstand was a little flimsy, but works OK. I would have given it a higher review, but on the front of the case had what looked like a fingerprint over where the Zune's screen is. I thought I just got my fingerprint on it when I was putting it together, but it would not wipe off. It's almost like someone touched the plastic when it was still warm during manufacturing."
3,You get what you pay for,"It is 25ft, white, and has two connectors at each end of CAT5e cable, so i got what I ordered. Like others have said though, the white housing that bundles all the internal wires is thinnnn. If you just have a desktop and arent moving it around much, thats fine, but for a lap top, be prepared for the housing to separate from the male connector in a couple days... still works, but its only a matter of time before one of the internal wires break too..."
5,"Ethernet Cable, CAT5e - 25 ft White",The cable is a bit longer than I need it but works wonderful. I use it to connect my PS3 to my modem/router. It has improve my connection online vs. my wireless especially when the Internet is being heavily used.
3,Not So Sunny Patch,A good story but not for very young children. It is quite dark at times as a character named Spiderus makes it clear that he would eat the bug children or their parents if given the chance! It is based on the tv series but has different voices for the lead characters of Miss Spider and Holley.
3,Disturbing film,"The movie opens with a melancholy, off-beat, off-key melody while we are twisting and winding through a forest, which made me feel disoriented and nauseous. The bad guy, ""Spideris"" is a pale white spider with distorted features, a character Tim Burton (""Corpse bride"") would love.This character frightened my two-year so much that he grabbed my finger and used it to turn off the TV.I feel like a terrible father that I allowed him to watch this movie."
1,Good Price - Very Limited Use by Date,"Got 36 bags at a very good price. Only problem is the ""Best Used By Date"" is less than 6 weeks away. I love popcorn but not enough to have it every day to use it up. I will be giving most of it away. Hopefully not all these great food bargains are just clearing out of ""old"" stock!-Reea"
4,It was alright,"I got this for my friend and he really enjoys it. He replaced it with a keyboard that was much older. The only pain was the software because I had a hard time finding where I should download it. After I found that out, he downloaded it plus used/using it and had/have no problems."
1,Disappointment,"I thought this book would contain some interesting short stories in Hillerman's vein. Hillerman, yes, I guess, but boring. I just threw this book away. Don't waste your money"
5,Like the greatest hits,I owned the greatest hits and then got this. I get confused as to which is the greatest hits and this album. I can listen to it nonstop without getting tired. In my ears he is better than Garth in many respects. Go Kenny....
4,great for anyone,"im 19 and typically don't listen to country music...mostly punk and hard rock, some hip-hop, u kno...typical teenage music. But I got this CD for my mom for Christmas and we listened to it in the car on the way to visit my grandparents. I think it is a perfect CD to sit back and relax to. My favorite song is ""Never Gonna Feel Like that Again"" because I can totally relate to it as I leave high school and move on to college. What makes it so great is that Kenny seems so genuine, and all the songs seem to have a deep meaning behind them. So I would highly reccomend this CD to anyone, no matter what kind of music you like because I can guarantee that anyone culd find at least 4 songs that tehy can totally relate to"
5,A Great Album from Kenny,"This album by Kenny Chesney is one of the best country albums released during 2002. The first single off of the CD, ""Young"", was a big hit on country radio, and a great, fun song about growing up that most people can relate to. Also included on this CD is ""The Good Stuff"", a song about what is important in life.""A Lot of Things Different"" is about what someone may have done differently, if they had the chance to change things. ""Dreams"" is about someone looking for that special someone to spend their life with, to grow old with.The title track of the album, ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"" is another fun, relaxing song. On the bonus track, ""I Can't Go There"", Kenny sings about a past love and how everything he does and everywhere he goes, he is reminded of the past love. Tim McGraw provides background vocals on the song.There is a great collection of songs on this album; from the more serious, to the upbeat, fun songs."
2,Growing Pains,"Only about half of seeds sprouted. The ones that sprouted only grew about an inch, then fell over. I followed instructions. Maybe I should have put all 400 seeds in one 4-inch pot for better results."
3,The funniest worst written book ever written!,"This book is great to read aloud to a friend. It is so poorly written and side splittingly funny, that it is hard to read for long spells. It is necessary to stop and breathe for a while. The imagery is hysterical."
1,Something is wrong with this edition. DIFFERENT ARTISTS !!!,"I am seeing different artists for some of the songs. Ruthless People, the title track is by Mick Jagger.The following is a listing of the original versions of these songs AS PERFORMED by the original artists and featured in the movie.1- Ruthless People - Mick Jagger(produced by David A. Stewart)2- Give Me The Reason - Luther Vandross(produced by Luther Vandross)3- Modern Woman - Billy Joel(produced by Phil Ramone)4- Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home) - Paul Young(produced by Laurie Latham)5- No Say In It - Machinations(produced by Julian Mendelsohn)6- Waiting To See You - Dan Hartman(produced by Dan Hartman)7- Dance Champion - Kool & The Gang(produced by Ronald Bell and I.B.M.C.)8- Neighborhood Watch - Michael Colombier(produced by Michael Colombier )9- Stand On It - Bruce Springsteen(produced by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Landau and Chuck Plotkkn)10- Don't You Want My Love - Nicole(produced by Lou Pace)"
4,Excellent overview of dental hygiene studies,"This is an excellent overview of all the studies necessary to qualify for national board exams. In outline form, it is designed to review each section of the national exam."
2,Not worth the price,Pros: very easy to set up. That's it!Cons: Interference every time someone walks in front/they turn off for no reason/not nearly loud enough.
3,How dues this speaker compare to the Brookstone Speaker?,"I am in the market for a wireless speaker to play music that I have stored in a CD jukebox in my basement and from my I-Pod. Brookstone has a wireless speaker that they are selling for $150, however I wanted to get some user reviews before shelling out that much for 1 speaker. It sounded good in the store, however I would like to get some feedback from someone who has used the speakers. The Acoustic model here has gotten so-so reviews and I would not mind paying more for the Brookstone model if it plays qualilty sound. Any feedback would be most appreciated!"
2,mediocre,"Transmitting from inside the house to the backyard, for a distance of about 35 feet did not work well. The audio was noisy and intermittent.Even with a good connection the sound quality is not very good. There are other solutions for wireless audio that I have tried and they work much better."
3,Not bad,"I was a little skeptical when I first made this purchase. Seems to work pretty good for the most part. Every once in a while I get some static, but changing channels seem to address the problem."
2,Just OK,"The speakers look nice, but don't act that way. They seem to work better near the source (transmitter)however, when I moved one of the speakers 35 feet away (through two walls) it didn't receive the signal very well. Even after I played with the controls on the speakers and the transmitter the reception was below average at best or I would randomly loose the signal and only the speaker near the souce would work. I used to have a different brand which had a seperate reception knob and made it easy to tune in the source. Those speakers came in loud and clear. I would not recommend the Acoustic Research AW-811. The speaker control knobs are just plain frustrating."
1,Speaker does not work - 2 separate times,The original and replacement speaker did not work. Waiting to see if the third time is the charm. Had to cover the first return postage ($14) out of my own pocket.
1,Finally Failed - 11/2006,"I ordered the AR wireless speaker and headphone combination. They were shipped separately. The headphones arrived first and work as desired. Today the speaker came. I set it up according to the directions and by chance selected the same channel the headphones were on. The XMradio, which the headphone transmitter was attached to, immediately came through the wireless speaker. I am debating whether or not to order another speaker to get stereo. The quality is as expected from a plastic bucket, as another reviewer called it. To be used as a weather-proof outdoor speaker it will perform as expected. I am completely satisfied, but can only give a 4 as I'm not over-whelmed with having to use 8 size C batteries with it.Edit - the speaker went south. It no longer works and is thrown away. I would not buy another. I now would give it less than a one star if I could change it."
1,The concept is great........,"Bought the unit and it worked great for the price. Love the handle feature! Tried various areas with good reception. After ten or so tries the on switch fried. Exchanged,same problem.I think research should be more than just a title. Although I wish I had one that worked."
4,What happened to Ozzy?,".... though I have heard two tracks from it--the one with Jimmy Buffett and the famous duet with Miss Piggy and Ozzy Osbourne. And friends, that duet is the very reason I'm writing this review. If you're a fan of ""The Osbournes"" reality show, .... you need to hear this track.Here's why: During the intro and outro of the song, Ozzy has a substantial speaking part, and... YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK HE'S SAYING! CLEARLY!This CD was recorded in 1995. ...."
1,Pass on this tool.,"This is not a 15 amp router. It is a 10 Amp router. I purchased this tool to do raised panel. The tool was delivered with two broken plastic parts. I immediatly called Yukon tools and spoke to Gary for replacement parts. As I am looking at the tool to describe the parts I noticed that it is only 10 Amps, and asked if this is a mistake. Yukon tools told me that it is listed incorrectly, that it is only 10 Amps, and they will correct the problem. I was convinced by Yukon Tools to try out the router. I did, and found it to be underpowered. My advise is to PASS on this router."
3,Good for your collection only,"This album is from the '81 tour supporting Tatoo You. It was the first tour of the Stones that I had the opportunity to see. As an album it is pretty thin, but looking back at it now more than twnety-five years there are a couple of tracks that make having this for your Stones collection worthwhile. The opener Under My Thumb, as well as Shattered, brought back good memories and the takes are quite fresh, and then to a lesser extent the takes of Imagination and Time Is On My Side are also good to have. The thing that is haunting about this album - an obvious toss off by the Stones - is what would the rest of the show have sounded like if they had bothered to give us a second disk from these shows with great tracks that were being played live for the first or second times such as When The Whip Comes Down, Waiting On A Friend, Black Limousine, Beast Of Burden - all of which were part of the set list for that tour. Nearly thirty years ago."
2,Nice ornament for a coffee table but fails as a travel guide,"This beautifully published glossy guidebook contains an abundance of visually striking, highly professional photography. A few oblique angle illustrations of some temple sites would be a welcome addition to any guide. However, as a source of useful information, it is a disappointment. It is short on hard facts and will undoubtedly be left at home when the trip begins. For an easy-to-use format with more meat I preferred Fodors. At the other extreme, with everything you could possible want to know, is Footprint. The latter, however, is not so user friendly."
4,DC's Greatest Heroes now here to collect,"Okay so you get a blind box and aren't sure what you will find. The figures go together easily and the extra pieces make up the Batmobile. This is one of those things you get if you like the comics and are a collector. Not one for everyone, especially because you can't pick which character you are going to get."
5,Just what I needed,"As someone who has always used word or hand-coded HTML, this book was exactly what I needed to become proficient with Dreamweaver and really exploit its power.After a few hours with the book, I feel like I've increased my effectiveness tremendously."
4,Dreamweaver tutorial - Good Reference Material,"I found this book to be fine; well-organized and straight-forward, a good reference book. Not at all technical and maybe a little over-simplified for professional developers. For example, there is a section on how to add a form to a webpage. Good information, but directed to people newer to the world of web dev."
3,dreamweaver for dummies,"The book was okay, but the CD that came with it was broken and couldn't be used."
4,Smart Read,"This book deals with those of us who are gay and are trying to find that perfect partner. I guess it spoke strongly to me because while I am in my early 30s, I was dating someone in his early 20s. While a difference in 10 years may not be much, in this age bracket it does prove to be. The longing to be with someone, falling for the wrong person, and missing the better choice out of blind passion. Wonderful story!"
5,Authors Comments,"A scandalous tale that the Mormons believed was long dead and burried finds new life when new evidence surfaces. This story revolves around the attempt to stop this material from being published. When the novel unfolds the reader is treated to a story with romance, murder, kidnapping and intrigue that will capture the reader's attention.Roy and Julie must flee for their lives having to escape the country to keep their pursuers from catching them. The chase is intense with motivated fanatics trying everything in their power to locate them. An adventure that is international in scope. You have a chance to learn something of the beginnings of Mormonism as the story unfolds.This novel was started about six years after I became aware of this early Mormom historical tale which comprises the basic plot. It begged to be written and I kept coming back to the conclusion that this would make a wonderful story."
5,A remarkable little book . . .,"Few people treat the concepts of *fast* and *slow* time in a cultural sense, (not a clock sense), quite so well. In this context Kubler also provides a clear working definition of an artist's entrance into an era, and what comprises real artistic invention as opposed to the replication of stereotypes. Still fresh decades after Kubler wrote this core text; Kubler defines the dynamics of artistic innovation with the same clarity that Thomas Kuhn did for the sciences in that other core text: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions."
2,"Try again, Scott Heim","Personally, I couldn't finish it. The prose had moments of beauty, but was mostly florid and overbaked. I don't mind unpleasantness in fiction, but how much is too much? I thought ""Mysterious Skin"" was intermittently great and full of potential -- let's hope this was a sophomore slump. I love to see a young gay writer putting out novels, especially ones set outside the NY-LA-SF triangle. I'm already looking forward to Scott Heim's next novel, and here's hoping it's a little more . . . down to earth."
1,Scott Heim's swan song?,"Personally I hope so. This is the most florid, overwrought piece of trailer trash fiction I've read in years. Lurid and ultimately silly. Heim seems to have lost touch with reality, replaced that with going for the artsy gold. Well, he missed by a mile. Ugh. Sad decline of a promising once young talent."
3,Extremely over-priced Novice level tourist guide,"What the reader expects is an atlas of these crater structures, but what you get is little more than the content provided by any other run-of-the-mill tourist type book. This could have been a great work had there been some real meat and history added. Above all else, however is the insult of a [high]price tag ... outragious."
4,"It was a good page-turner, but I didn't like the ending.","I recently read this book, and, although it was a good page-turner, the ending didn't seem right. From the Woodhaven escape plot until the end, the story became far-fetched. I also feel that the detailed events surrounding the mother's death should have been revealed by the person responsible. (We're given the assumption that it was definitely Brian, although, for all we know, Kevin could have just been denying the murder. After all, the narrator didn't witness the events)."
4,Good cook-book for raw-fooders,"Its a great book but very short. It starts with a brief introduction to raw foods, why its a healthy diet to live on and so on. Very good for a beginner. But I recommend ""Living Cuisine"" by Renee Loux Underkoffler if you really want a thick, comprehensive good reference book that you can keep in your kitchen and use everyday. Not to discredit this book at all, its very nicely written and has some delicous recipes."
3,Simple Career Guide for Newsroom Editors,"Do you dream of being a newsroom editor? Then check out this book. It provides some history along with a basic career guide including tips on how to become a newsroom editor, management and decision making advice."
2,Dull,"Dull, hero-worshipping, and written in the style of an old-fashioned encyclopedia. (And I admire Washington!) Still on the look-out for a book that would hold an upper-elementary school student's interest."
2,Not nearly as good as the first season,"The show got stuck in a rut throughout most of the second season. Most of the episodes seemed pretty contrived, and the storylines start to get predictable. The bright spots of course are anything involving Richard Belzer and Ice T - perhaps the biggest problem with this set is their lack of screen time."
1,BUMMER!!!!!!,Not able to get it to function completely in Vist Home Premium.Service from mfg. was a waste of time.
4,everything now review,"This record has an interesting mix of pure joy, anxiety, and anger. There is a definite 60s psychedelic influence with everything now's sound. Its also apparent that bands like modest mouse and neutral milk hotel had an impact on the group as well. The vocalist at times sings as though he is being chased by someone down the street who is determined to do him harm which gives the album a paranoid vibe to it. ""Rocketship, IN"" to me describes the loneliness and isolation of being in an indie rock band in a state that (with the expection of bloomington) lacks a viable scene for groups like EN! to thrive in. ""Fishbowl prank"" sends the album out on a high note with a large gathering of backup singers chanting everyone will sing together! This ep will keep listeners on their toes because no one song sounds alike. Highly recommended."
2,narrow-focused,"If you are the mother of an incarcerated son or daughter, I would not recommend this book; it is focused primarily on the incarceration of a husband. There were some helpful tips; however, there was a lot of ""filler"" that most people could just use common sense and wouldn't need to consult a help book about."
3,Should this tide us over until Halo3 on Xbox2,Yes yes and yes we know this game suffered mostly by way of hype-bomb syndrome. Essentially the creative marrow of Bungie's Mac basejumped ship halfway through this project and the Microsoft bigwigsstepped in and said that this is going to be the game that will serve asthe ramp to get consumer kids onto Xbox Live. Because of that chaptersof the game that would have made the game more substantial andmeaningful in a Star Wars operatic way were lobotomized. The mostdisappointing thing of all is that this is going to be the last Halo releaseon Xbox 1 and yes you will need to buy xbox2 to see how the trilogyends in Halo3.
4,Bittersweet,"Amazing. Beautiful. Phenomenal. Great. Wow...words cannot explain my feelings towards this game. It would be an injustice to not explain how great of a game this is. Areas are enormous. Graphics are exquisite. Story had me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end, but the ending pissed off the living s!#! out of me. F#@!ed up! A recommend buy and a keeper."
2,"There is no true ending, just a cliffhanger. Boring.","Halo is still the flagship game for Xbox. Halo 2 is truly a let down. There is no true ending to the game, just a cliffhanger to get you to buy Halo 3. I bought Halo 2 on opening day played through all the difficultly levels (all but legendary, which is way harded than Halo) and have not played is sense. As for the flood boring boring boring. The playability of Halo 2 doesn't even compare to the playability of Halo. And yes the graphics in Halo2 are great, but the game turned boring real fast. Plus you can finish the game a lot fast than Halo. Last words: Rent the game first."
4,Halo 2,"Halo 2 is an overall great game. Though, there are some things that are problems. The graphics in the game, and mostly in the cut scenes are pretty ugly. Also, as in the first Halo, the level designs are very very repetitive. Just like in Halo CE, you will find yourself confused as to where your gong and that Have I already been here? feeling. The other problem is that while the gameplay is truley fantastic, the single player campaign is very short. Expect to beat the game in 10 hours or less.The multiplayer portion of the game is quite good. Many diferent types of gameplay and a variety of a few good maps makes this one FPS multiplayer game to get.Aside from the graphics, level design, and longetivity of the campaign, Halo 2 is just as great in terms of gameplay and intersting storyline as the first. Making this a mandatory purchase for XBOX owners."
3,I beat this one in 2 days,"Okay, after you get past all the hype, this just a mediocre game. Don't get me wrong, I love ""Halo"", but when you finish ""Halo 2"" after just a few hours of play, it seems hardly worth the money spent.""Halo 2"" is extremely fun to play. It wonderful driving/piloting all of the vehicles and firing the new weapons, even though I did miss not having my trusty assault rifle. Visually it is very stimulating, and the story line(continuation of the first game)is much easier to follow and understand for some of the youger gamers.There is even maybe some time to be spent in the multiplayer modes, but unless you have X-Box Live this will get boring very quickly. The multiplayer levels are not as large or exciting as ""Halo"", and it just makes multiplayer levels kinda boring.All in all ""Halo 2"" is fun to play but the fun dosen't last long at all. I would suggest that you wait a couple of months and buy this one used."
1,Where is my game?,"I cannot rate ""how much fun the game is"" or ""how I would rate the game overall"" as I still haven't recieved my pre-ordered copy. I pre-ordered HALO 2 from Amazon 9.10.2004 and today 11.9.2004, the day I was supposed to have it, I still don't see it set to Ship fro Amazon/Targe t or whoevers supposed to be handling my order. I tried to upgrade my shipping, yes I was willing to pay more, but I was not able to get the change made. My order at present reads ""shipping soon"", ok, that tells me alot. Not happy with how the order was handled. I was working on the understanding that if I pre-ordered HALO 2, my copy would ship on either the 8th or 9th of November, not be held up. Bad marketing Amazon, bad handling of my order, may you get a lump of coal in your stocking for Christmas."
3,Halo 2 Limited Edition,"The purchase was not complete due to misunderstanding of what was listed in the listing. Although the tin case is great, which is why I rated the product 3 stars."
1,Left me high and dry,"The stapler worked OK for about a day, then started shooting twisted staples. It turned out to have a defective nose. I called the company and they offered to send a replacement part. They also wanted me to send them the old part (they would arrange and pay for the shipping). It took some doing getting the old part off, since the threads were glued on really tight. But when the new part arrived, they sent the wrong part. They really should have replaced the whole unit, rather than expecting me to do the repair myself. Very dissatisfied with the product and the company's service."
1,Poor quality control,"I purchased this tool based on reviews....should have bought the Senco.I had to repair the nailer before I could even use it...the magazine spring was defective. I had to file the interchangeable head in order to install it. I was able to staple about 600 sq. ft. of flooring before the magazine spring failed again.Porta Nails is sending me a new spring, (they have no service in the Sacramento area)which I can install. Would prefer a new tool.The stapler works well when it works. But based on this experience, I will go with local vendors and brands known for reliability in the future.I cannot recommend this tool."
2,"Cute, but fake.. :(","Nice looking watch. The buttons on the side, however, are not functional. They can't be pushed, pulled or turned. I would have given it 1 star, if I did not buy it so deeply discounted..."
1,Too bad there isn't a 0 star option,I purchased a Sony phone similar to this one.....just minus the answering machine. I thought since it was Sony it would be a great phone. Boy was I wrong. As another reviewer stated the channel surfing is the worst. I can be sitting right next to the base and the phone cuts off and surfs for another channel. Forget about moving your head once you find a channel. That will cause the phone to surf as well. Cordless is useless with Sony. Another thing that bothers me is there is no volume button for the ringing. I am about to have a baby and didn't need this until now. The phone rings terribly loud and since the baby will be in my room at the beginning it will definitely cause a problem. I love Sony but will never purchase a phone from them again. My cousin had a Sony phone which ended up in the garbage and I think mine is about to join hers.
1,multiple showers,"Thought this was a good idea to purchase until installation time. As had been stated on other reviews, this shower head leaks at the junction of the connector between the wall connection and the shower head connection. I sent the first one back thinking it was just a defective unit, but when I received the second one it did the EXACT same thing. Needless to say, I returned this one too! I don't know how quality control operates at this company, but they should look into this problem. This is a poorly designed unit."
3,Good performance for the $$,This is a great improvement over what we had. The stream of water is good and generous. The deposits are easily wiped off as promised. A person can really get wet with all the water this faucet puts out. A good deal for the money.
4,"Works great, be careful on install!","The product works great, and my wife loves the ability to use the shower head AND the hose at the same time. Speaking of the hose, the quality of the connectors for the hose ends are pretty bad. I broke one of the hose ends while tightening it to the unit. They're the only part of this shower head that you're not supposed to use tools on, the cheap plastic connector doesn't have any extra strength when tightening it. I'll try contacting Peerless (Delta) to get a replacement hose for the broken connectors.So be careful with the hose, and enjoy an amazing showerhead at a great price!"
5,wet and nice,"shower system works fine although it really needs to have the water flow dampener taken out, or drilled out, to get a stronger water flow on your body. would tell others to buy this;"
5,Incredibly Great Value!,"Read quite a few of the reviews on this, and I must say I was a bit antsy about ordering. However thanks to Amazon's amazing return policy, I decided to give it a shot, and oh am I so glad I did. A lot of the reviews talk about slight leakage around the fittings, a problem which I did initially have. However I applied 1-2 layers of teflon tape (a 15 second job total and only about $1 to buy at a hardware store) and now it works amazing. Great pressure, lots of different options as far as the secondary head is concerned, and it is also VERY easy to take the handle out and then snap it right back into place. Would definitely recommend, we actually plan on ordering a 2nd one for our guest bathroom."
1,Massage...no!!,My old shower massage started to leak after about 6 years so started looking for a new one. Well the reviews seemed pretty good on this one so I bought it. Mistake...this is simply a fancy two headed shower head...but no massage. Had plenty of pressure on the old one and may yet put it back on. If you want a shower head with massage capabilities look further for one that the pressure is adjustable.
5,"Peerless 76950 2-in-1 Shower System, Chrome","AMAZING!!! Last night was my first SHOWER after hip replacement using my Peerless. My husband had already put together my bath bench (am not allowed to stand up in the shower yet), and my ceiling to floor grab bar (both of these were also purchased here on Amazon). I hadn't seen the entire set up yet and this was my first trip up this flight of stairs to get to the main bathroom. I used every piece I'd purchased and this shower was an absolute delight and heaven! I still feel scrubbed. I can't bend past 90 degrees BUT the hand-held unit let me get to lower legs and feet, front and back and everywhere! Oh, since I also had FuzzyButt's perch (my African Gray) is just above the bench, he also got a shower and loved the entire show!)My husband used teflon tape in ALL the fittings NO LEAKS!!!Heavenly!"
5,The best showerhead for your money,"This is by far the best showerhead I have ever used. I am a big guy (6 foot 6) and when I went to college i tried three different showerheads in my dormroom before I got this one. That was over three years ago. It has gone through over three years of use including being in 4 different bathrooms during that time( I moved to a different room during school, got married and this was the one in our apartment, moved and used it at my wifes parents house for a week, and then finally here now in Illinois!) This is by far the best I have ever used, great water pressure, and zero problems. There is no reason to get any other showerhead, i got this at wal mart for i think just under 25 dollars and they stopped selling it there and so I am glad to see that they are still available!! I want an extra just to take with me when we stay in hotels!!"
3,No shut-off setting; switch is hard to turn,"I used the dual-head setting for showers, and the handheld only option for washing my hair. Both had excellent spray pattern and water flow. The problems for me were:1. moving the darn valve ""switch"" back and forth every day is annoying because the switch is so stiff. If you have grip/finger pain you won't like this.2. When washing my hair with the handheld part, I want to shut off the water while I squish the shampoo through my hair. No way to turn this off, or even to a small trickle. I got it down to a large trickle, but it wastes way too much water.So, I'm still looking for the ""right"" shower head."
3,Not what I expected,"Pro: Easy to install. Shower is nice size when using.Cons:It feels like it will not last. I hate the plastic feel of the handle. Also the hose is short compared to the one I replaced with this one. Also when switching the settings for the pressure when using the handlheld, I can say that is worthless.I gave three stars because it looks impressive and does do its job. I just wish it was a better quality product."
1,Poor build,"Shower head kept leaking and wouldn't secure tight enough. When I tried to secure it even more with tools, it broke. Will not buy from Peerless again."
3,"Decent, but not great","I bought this shower head and the 76410 double-head at the same time for both bathrooms. The other is the preferred. This one has a limited range of spray direction due to the design of the joint where the unit attaches. This one also has the more serious failing that the wand sprayer does not stay securely fastened to the fixed portion. It is designed to sort of pop into place and there is not a real positive mechanism for holding it. The result is that the wand pops off occasionally when one bumps the hose or handle while showering with the wand in its fixed position. I recommend getting the other shower head. Regardless, one must remember that these are inexpensive plastic shower heads and both are perfectly useful for their intended purpose."
4,Great shower from a good showerhead.,"I like almost everything about this shower head.I don't find it fragile. I like the pressure and I like the different spray patterns from the hand unit.I like being able to use the hand unit while still being showered from above.As for the person that thinks this thing is not a water saver, this shower and all other showers legal for sale in the United States are 'low flow' devices. If it drains water faster than the 'low flow' standard, it is not a legal product.My problem with this head is personal--I've got one of those ""automatic shower cleaner"" thingies hanging below my shower. This shower head makes it impossible to keep that item in the shower.Since I'm more attached to a clean shower than I am to this shower head, I returned it for a hand shower of more compatible design. The showering experience is still nice, though not as good as with the Peerless 2-in-1."
4,Great showerhead!!!,"This unit replaces a ""Home Depot"" store brand piece of junk that caused my pipes to leak!!! Anyway with half way decent water pressure (think crummy NYC apartment) this unit provides a decent stream. Also the hand shower is a nice size not to large like some other units. Only caveat is the hand shower has 3 settings which are pretty unremarkable. But overall for the price a nice shower unit."
4,Needed an upgrade.,Works great. Pressure is spot on. Only complaint... the cord is a little small. Easy fix- my husband used the old cord. We can now reach both our dogs for bath time.
3,Made of plastic and feels like it,"I was disappointed to receive this shower head and discover that the ""chrome"" is all plastic, including the primary coupling joint. I realize that you get what you pay for, and this shower head is significantly cheaper than units comparable in shape, but I didn't think it was naive to expect actual metal components - not the whole shower head, mind you, but at least part of it.Actually, the problem that really bothers me is that the switch that changes the spray from one head to both heads is very hard to turn. I have to use a washcloth to grip it while I'm showering if I want to change it - again, it's plastic, and there is only a small tab on the rotating part to help with grip. Taking the center sprayer out also moves the entire shower head, which isn't a terribly big deal, but still not ideal."
2,Crap,"I bought this after reading reviews on Amazon... I was looking to convert my regular shower into a handheld so I could give my toddler a bath... but the cord is too short and the pressure is not sufficient... Overall, its clumsy."
3,Would have been great but...,"When I received the shower head, I was really happy because it looked like it was made well. However, after removing the shower head from the package and installing, I turned the adjustment setting to the left and the plastic piece for the settings popped off! Luckily, the piece popped right back on. The downside is I cannot turn the adjustment settings to the left. Otherwise, the plastic piece come off. I am not thrilled with the quality of this..."
2,Just Okay,"The handle is not metal but rather made of some inexpensive plastic like material which can't take a scrubbing. Easy to install, works as stated, but configuration confusing for house guests to learn without a visual tutorial from the home owner. Not a bad product, but I would not recommend it. To me, it's trying to kill too many birds with one stone."
2,Buyers Remorse,"I bought this shower head based on all the great reviews on Amazon. I feel cheated. I replaced an old Waterpik handheld shower and thought this would be a nice upgrade. The design looks great but loses on functionality. The water pressure is too weak to be effective. I even pulled the two green flow regulators without any luck. I had VERY GOOD water pressure with my old shower head. There are too many holes to maintain the water flow. The outer ring is a light stream over a wide area, while the inner ring (handheld) goes to a small stream. Switching to the outer ring only doesn't add any pressure, while switching to the handheld only does. The handheld only stream funnels to a tight stream, so you have to move around or move the shower head around. I wonder why so many reviewers on Amazon gave this 5 stars....I regret buying this item and will now spend another $25 to get a standard Waterpik."
2,Not great,"This shower head disappoints in two ways: first, it has two connections that are hard to tighten -- so it's almost impossible not to have leaking or looseness. Secondly, the spray from the inner part (hand-held) is too sharp to be comfortable. But when you open it for the inner and outer ring to flow, you don't have enough pressure to work. It also has a very wide spray so that it is difficult to get a good rinse. Disappointing."
2,Leaking Everywhere,"I am impressed with the water pressure coming out of this head, but the product leaks in places that are unfix-able. Sadly, sending this back for a refund."
2,Leaks,"This was supposed to be an upgrade from our old shower head that leaked, this one leaks too. having to pull the detachable shower head out from the stand makes the pipe turn (which can't be tightened more) then the pipe leaks all over the wall."
2,Returned it.,Constructed in a way that caused it to leak every time I tried to move it to use the hand held part. Leaked even when it wasn't touched.
