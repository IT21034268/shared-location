5,"The heart thumping, ear popping, body shaking experience!",*NSYNC is the best most talented band to ever walk the face of this earth but to see them in concert makes you feel 100 times more excited. The PopOdyssey tour was one of their best tours ever and I don't think that any other band can top their phenominal dancing and singing because it makes you feel so awesome just to see them smiling (at you) from stage!! Not to mention Justin's irresistable bod!!!!!!!! You have to buy this video because if you haven't seen them in person it is the next best thing!!! Trust me!! ~Justin's ultimate number 1 fan of all time!!!!
5,YOU MUST TRY THESE AT LEAST 1 TIME!!!!,"I lived in San Diego for a few years while going to college, SDSU!!! I happened to buy these randomly at a local CVS, after that day, no other drier sheet would do. Something about this smell just relaxes me, i have to wash my sheets, blankets, pillow cases and towels using these sheets.I will put 3+ dryer sheets in at times when washing my bedding, not that it needs it, but just to have the smell sink heavily into the fabric. i will also do an extra 20-30 minutes after they are dryer for my smell power.i moved back up north and could not get these anymore, they left my mind for a while...then one day they popped back in my mind, i spent hours searching for the brand/scent, i couldn't remember who made them. found them on amazon and ordered a case. now my life is better, i sleep better, i dry out of the shower better, everything is better!"
1,Warped and Crappy,"This pan doesn't sit evenly on my grill and doesn't heat evenly, I wouldn't recommend it. This is too basic of a product to settle for low-quality when you can easily get something much better for the same price."
3,Ummm... These Aren't Flashcards,"Although the electronic flashcard software is versatile, there are no physical flashcards in this package. There is a paperback book with several questions per page, but the pages are cheap paper and aren't even perforated. This is flashcard software and a quizbook. If you want physical flashcards look elsewhere."
4,Pretty good study tool for the new CCNA Exams,"If you haven't heard, Cisco has released new exams for the CCNA certification and it is only natural that Cisco Press has released a self-study flash card book that can be used for the exam study.Completely update from the last book, which I worked on, this book now has over 1100 flash cards covering all 3 exams.I found the questions to cover the objectives and judging from the content of the flash cards; they seem to right in line with the exams.About the only thing the cards could use is some of them could have more detailed explanations and possible web links.There is also a cd included, which has over 500 practice questions and another 500 flash cards. Overall a very good tool coupled with the Cisco Press CCNA Intro and ICND books."
3,Disappointed with CD content,"I purchased this pack primarily so that I could load the flash cards onto my PocketPC (Dell Axim) and study ""on the run"". Despite the claim that it would work with ""Most Pocket PC handheld devices"", it really doesn't. This claim may have been true in late 2002 when the content was developed but it certainly does not work right with the 2003 PocketPC OS. It requires the eMbedded Visual Basic Runtime which isn't supported on the latest revision of the OS. My personal experience was that once I loaded it up I had to hard-reset my Axim to get anything to work right.Be advised."
4,nice product but not cheap or worth the price unless ur a huge fan,i love this i wish it would had a smaller head on it i have to wear hats or helmets for it to fit which sucks and also if u plan on wearing it to a bar or adult party thats another problem as the mouth is closed so ull have to cute it open if u wanna eat or drink also on top the eye holes are lil small i cut them bigger to see better also the fur put on there is a little wierd but its okay it works just not as high class as it should be for how much ur paying even if the price is half off of regular price but over all after some things fixed to it works great..
4,"Christmas Unwrapped, History of Christmas","I applaud the History Channel for providing the true history behind this pagan holiday. The origins predate the birth of Christ, and the traditions of sun worship, festivals, and wild parties are revealed within the program. Unfortunately, the masses are unaware the true about the day that has been passed off as the birth of Christ. Christmas is anything but Godly, and it's all about Capitalism....."
5,Judith's Review,What a wonderful production! There is a history and story to Christmas that you never knew! This makes a wonderful gift for any age.
1,not too good,"I bought this camera, it worked once and became very very HOT, it would not tuurn on again, I only got to take 4 pictures before the darn cheap think stopped working. It was so hot I could not hold the camera. I removed the battery, the next day all it would do was flash a red light then turn off"
4,3000 years of Hallowe'en history crammed into 50 minutes...,"If you are looking for a succinct, ""Cliffs Notes"" style presentation on the history of Halloween, this DVD is the perfect choice. 'The Haunted History of Halloween' traces the early Celtic and Roman roots of the holiday, its subsequent amalgamation with Christian practices, the nascence of Halloween in America, and the various American permutations of the holiday up to the present day celebrations. For being only 50 minutes long, the documentary truly does a decent job of outlining the overarching structure of the Halloween phenomenon. At the very least, after watching this presentation you'll be able to provide all kinds of tidbit information at your next Halloween soir√©e."
4,the haunted history of halloween,"this video is very imformative, Me and my neice learned alot. We both love all the videos from the history channel."
2,Not THAT great,"After reading all of the RAVE reviews regarding this video I was expecting something really spectacular, but was disappointed. The video is not that great or that informative and it seems like it was made a LONG time ago. It's worth watching once, but I'll probably never watch it again and overall I wish I had not bought it. It just wasn't that good."
5,Great Halloween Documemtary for history buffs,"If the older kids are too old for Halloween ""kid stuff"" but still want to get into the Halloween Spirit, I would recommend this documentary if your older kids like history. It starts in the BC time period, explains how the church tried to incorperate paganism with christianity,how it was brought to America, up til the modern period. It does bring up the Salem witch trials and people being burned at the stake, and also how in the later 20th century there were razor blades found in apples. As an adult I found this interesting and entertaining."
3,Favorite for the holiday,whish they would update it for the holiday now since it looks to be about 20 years old. but then i guess they would have even more crazy people on it
4,Hawkwind - 'BBC Radio One Live In Concert' (BBC Windsong),"Quite similar to their hard-to-find import 'Space Rock In London' CD. In fact, I believe both discs are from the same exact September 1972 gig at the BBC studio. Just a bit differently edited. Great, crisp and produced sound on all six tracks, ""Born To Go"" (12:l6), ""Seven By Seven"" (9:36), ""Brainstorm"" (10:39), ""Master Of The Universe"" (9:53), ""Paranoia"" (9:24) and their smash hit earlier that summer ""Silver Machine"" (7:28). Keep in mind that this show took place just prior to their timeless unforgettable 'Space Ritual' tour. A must-have for all Hawkfans."
2,un gasto inecesario,"pense que me ayudaria con mis videos, pero la verdad es que el programa ya contaba con un codificador y realmente no era necesario.mi compra fue por falta de experiencia."
4,Ellis uber alles,A medium book from a great author. Many congratulations to him for his job but I waited something more from the first maxillofacial traumatologist of the world
1,Pincushioned images,"Here's what Nikon won't tell you (unless you push the customer service agents): This lens distorts the imagery at every focal length--not just the extreme telephoto range. Take a photo of something squarely framed, or, say, the siding on a house, and you will see that the image is pulled towards the center; the top, bottom, and sides bow inwards. This is true for the lens I bought and for ALL others opened in the store. Nikon says that Photoshop can fix these errors, but who wants to ""fix"" every portrait? For a lens that costs several hundred dollars--and one that's most frequently packaged with the D80--this is astonishing and, at best, disappointing."
3,"Decent contrast, excellent color, very poor pincushion.","The title of my review basically says it all. I sold this lens soon after getting it as part of a D80 kit. While the contrast and colors are better than expected from a kit lens, the pincushion is just terrible. In any of the pictures I took that featured vertical lines (posts, poles, building edges, etc) the pincushion was so bad that it is uncorrectable even with Photoshop CS2. This was noticeable at any focal length. In the pictures that featured no vertical lines of any type, however, I did not notice any pincushion effect. The ones that did, however, were bad enough (for me) to decide to sell the lens. While I would not recommend this lens to anyone, I don't think it is a horrible lens by any means. Just not quite up to my standards. My review is 2.5 stars but they don't let you do that so I picked 3 stars."
4,A GOOD LENS FOR AVERAGE USEAGE,I DONT UNDERSTAND ALL THE SOUR GRAPES ABOUT THIS LENS FROM OTHER REVIEWERS. THEY MUST USE THIS LENS FOR HAND BALL PRACTICE......OR JUST THROW IT AROUND........I USE THIS LENS ON MY NIKON D80 AND WITH THE NIKON SOFTWARE HAVE GOTTEN SOME VERY NICE RESULTS........GRANTED THIS IS NOT ANIKKOR 2.8 SUPER SHARP LENS...HOWEVER...IT REALLY DOES A NICE JOB ......I USED IT AT A AIR SHOW LAST WEEK AND TOGETHER WITH MY EPSON PRINTER GOT BEAUTIFUL RESULTS.........I REALLY DONT THINK THAT NIKON MAKES A BAD LENS.....THEIR GLASS IS MADE IN HOUSE .AS ALL THE OTHER CAMERA COMPANIES TRY TO COMPARE THEMSELVES TO THEM.SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A FINE EVERY DAY LENS WITH A NICE ZOOM THIS IS YOU BABY.........
4,Nice lens for the money,"I have had this lens for about a year and use it as my walk around lens. It is a very sharp lens. Haven't noticed a lot of CA but it does have some distortion. It focuses pretty close.The lens could use VR but then it would probably be as expensive as the 18-200mm VR.It is obviously a kit quality lens and not a pro lens but, all in all, I think it is a good, versatile focal length lens for the money."
3,Blah,I purchased this product thinking it might do something special for my hair. It left a lot to be desired. I didn't do anything for my daughters hair either. Left it dry and unmanageable. It offered little to no slip which is a no go for naturally curly hair. I will not be repurchasing. However I loved the price.
4,Fantastic fills,Festive funk fusion equipped with the proper chops and informed transitioning can only mean it was written by someone outside the contained genre.
1,Disappointing,"Knitting MachineI bought this machine for my daughter who is 8 years old, and at first it seemed Ok, but we quickly noticed that there was a big hole in her first attempt at a tube scarf. I assumed she was working too fast, so we started over and the same thing happened. I tried 2 different kinds of yarn and had the same results myself. The hooks consistently drop or completely miss grabbing the yarn. Very cute idea, too bad it just doesn't work. This will be going back."
1,Damaged CD,"The CD was damaged and didn't play properly. The songs that played properly were absolutely beautiful. But sadly,there were several songs with glitches and skips."
3,"informative, a little too repetitive","my son was not very interested in this book, but as I read it, it helped give me more of an idea about how to breakdown the potty training into very simplistic points for him to understand."
4,Great camera for the price,"Given the price, my expectations were not very high but this camera has really surprised me. Form factor is good - about the size of a 'real' camera. Construction is plastic but fairly well put together. The picture quality is decent. Configuration was relatively simple. It took very little time getting it onto the wireless network and configuring it to upload pictures periodically to an ftp server (sorry, no SFTP or SCP). Documentation is the biggest weak spot. The camera has definitely worked well for my needs."
4,Easy to setup and MAC friendly,"I love how easy the TRENDnet Wireless Internet Camera Server ( TV-IP100W Version C1) was to setup! I had it up and running in minutes. I mounted it on the front of my house in a Security Labs SLH-320 Weatherproof Camera Housing and monitor it using SecuritySpy Software (http://www.securityspy.com/) from my Macintosh. It even allows me to view it remotely from any browser, even from my iPhone! I even hooked it up using EvoCam (http://www.evological.com) with no problems."
3,So so camera server for $100+,Required some network technical expertise to get the camera to work. Quality is Ok for $100+ toy.
2,shouldn't have to hold the button down,You shouldn't have to hold the botton down the whole time you want it to sound. Could be a little louder.
1,Comic Disappointment,Many pages were blank in this book due to Disney's censoring of the artists' work. If you don't mind the few missing pages the artwork is well worth the money.
3,"Mediocre tactics, excellent point shooting","The book is written in a clear, easy-to-read style with many drawings and photographs to add to the clarity. Reading this book is a pleasure, so it is disappointing that the contents are not up to par.The book contains a variery of topics, some of which you can hardly call ""advanced patrol tactics"", like the chapter on contact & cover (which, in my opinion, is a very basic tactic). On the other hand, Rayburn seems a bit too enthusiastic about such topics as shooting through the windshield glass, which is a bit marginal in my opinion. Additionally, Rayburn uses about 1/3 of the book on point shooting. That's fine by me, and the section is excellent. Rayburn gives very good justification about using point shooting, and gives detailed information on how to practice it. The problem is, this book should be about tactics, not shooting..."
4,Advanced Patrol Tactics,It's a great experience that I cannot find anywhere on the open market. The author is definitely a great law enforcement trainer. The only concern that I have is the security for my other brothers and sisters which chosen the warrior path.
4,I get it but not until the final scene,"I watched this episode and slowly became aware of the hidden message. It became aware to me at the final scene, something that I had ancitipated was going on but I finally got confirmation. Something that I had been doing for awhile now.. I appreciate the sun glowing through the windows or the cool breeze blowing as I step outside. You know phrase ""Stop and smell the roses""? Well i started doing that recently because wheather it be mental or physical, how long will I be here?I know this may sound a little corny, but I think that I should have started appreciating the ""finer things of life"" a long time ago. So, aside from all of the above mentioned comments, i like this show."
2,"Stop putting your political agenda in ""entertainment""","I was enjoying the first episode of ""perception"" until they made one fatal mistake. There is a scene where a mentally ill man laughs when someone is lying. To prove this the main character plays an old clip of President Bush, and said mental patient is laughing. Wouldn't a clip of President Obama been more timely? Or is this a jab of some sort that President Bush is a liar and President Obama is not. It would be nice if hollywood could learn how to entertain without inserting their political views. Even if I agreed with it, it is very inappropriate."
3,"Vacuum GOOD, Cup Filter BAD!!!","I bought this vacuum after my unmentionable OTHER vacuum went to the dump. I like the cleaning power of the whirlwind litespeed, and it is light, but I HATE HATE HATE that little cup filter inside. It is hard to cleanout, it is very expensive to replace, and it wears out quickly if you vacuum more than once a week.I will NEVER buy another vacuum that has one of these little ""cupfilters"" in it. I would not recommend this product, unless you like paying $16.00 everytime you need to change this filter. Oh and the Hepa Filter is $20.00 to replace that, not sure how much the belt is because the vacuum came with a spare, that I have already had to replace by the way."
4,A MUST for any dog owner!,"My old vacuum finally bit the dust, so after reading all the rave reviews, I picked up this little devil. I have an Alaskan Husky, so there is ALWAYS dog hair & dander all over the house, and this is the first vacuum I've used that actually picks all of it up! The only problem with this vacuum is that the hose is NOT standard sized, so any attachments you may have from other vacuums don't fit this one. Not a big issue considering the price of this thing, I just bought a smaller vac to handle other stuff and use this one on the carpets and floors."
4,It works like a charm,"I was amazed by the sheer power of this vacuum cleaner. After I had used my old vacuum cleaner (incidently from Eureka too), the carpet looked clean. And then when I used this one right after the old one, this machine sucked up so much dust and fiber from the carpet. It was simply unbelievable to see how much dirt it was able to suck.It is very easy to clean. Even my 2 year old daughter can clean it. Cleaning the filter, though, is a little messy.I would recommend this to everyone."
3,"After 6 months, not so impressed.","When we first purchased this vacuum, we were very impressed. It was quiet and thorough, and easy to use. After 3 months, our first Whirlwind broke down because a part came off. We were still within warranty, so we returned it for another. We noticed how much quieter and better the new one worked than the first. After another 6 months, the second vacuum has become quite loud and the filter needs to be replaced. Filters are difficult to find and must be ordered over the internet. Even the Eureka site doesn't carry them. Additionally, if anything is caught in the brush or you just want to check the belt, you have to completely disassemble the base."
5,amazing results,"It is amazing how much dirt, dust, and hair this vacuum picks up. I live in an apartment with a not so efficient air conditioner and a shedding dog. You will be amazed and probably grossed out by how much this vacuum picks up. Easy to change the cup. Big chunks of cardboard but also gets up the finest dust. Also it has 3 filters on it."
2,Great for 1 1/2 years.....,"So, I've just figured out that really, when I'm looking at online reviews, I ought to look for people who have owned the item for a while! I bought this vacuum cleaner in October 2003. I loved it for a while. It picked up wonderfully. I loved seeing how much dirt got sucked into the clear canister!However. Two months ago the ball bearings froze up and melted the beater bar. We bought a used Eureka cleaner as a temporary vacuum while we waited for the parts to come in. The same thing happened with that Eureka! My husband fixed the old one with the parts that came in, and then it happened again. I think this must be a defect with Eureka vacuum cleaners.The best part about coming back and writing this online review for me is seeing that I didn't pay very much for the vacuum cleaner. :-)"
1,Really Disappointing,"This vacuum worked great maybe the first five times I used it, then it kept plugging up. Once I finally cleared all hoses of blockage the roller brush stopped working.I initally liked the vacuum because of it's light weight and being bagless, but now I am considering going back to the old stand-by."
4,IMPOSSIBLE!,"Having just purchsed this affordable upright, I was excited yet skeptical about the glowing remarks I read in the reviews for this product. And all I can say is WOW! My carpets have never looked better. It was so exciting to see all the dirt and pet hair get sucked up that I vacuumed the entire house instead of the 1 room I had planned to clean. It is light-weight yet powerful. And the dirt cup is a snap to dump. THANK YOU Eureka! Good things really can be affordable."
3,Vacume only lasted a year,"This was a great Vacume....for about a year. I live on a dirt road so there is alot of dust in the house. The cup filter had to be cleaned weekly or I would lose suction. And after about 3 months I never did have the suction it first had. The side Hepa filter is hard to find, I never did find a replacement for it, I just blew it out with the air compressor. It's been about a year and the motor just siezed on me. I am guessing it is because the side hepa filter got clogged. The side filter always looks clean, but blow it out and you will be amazed at how much fine dust is stuck in it. I am in search of a new vacume, and I don't think I will get another one of these."
3,Alcatraz Shmalcatraz,"We are spoiled when we see real life detective stories such as, ""The First 48."" Then when we see detective stories such as, ""Alcatraz,"" where detectives are handling evidence without gloves, rifling through boxes of 50 year-old evidence, and chasing criminals who have time-traveled from the closing months of the Kennedy administration, to present day San Francisco, leaves a lot to be desired. I thought the story had a lot of promise, at first. However when things evolve past the pilot, the story runs predictable.Would you like to see an excellent detective story? Watch the BBC's, ""Shirlock,"" (2010).Sherlock: Season One"
4,Return of the First Guard,"Of the 302 men who disappeared from Alcatraz when it closed, the pilot stated that something on the order of 42 were guards. Guy Hastings is the first guard to return. Given that, this episode is a lot less violent than some of the other episodes, as he's not a criminal continuing a crime spree. It provides some interesting information relating to Rebecca Madsen's back story. If you missed this episode, or are watching the series through, this is a necessary episode to purchase."
5,Alcatraz,This is a very interesting and entertaining show. I hated to see it ended after one season. Maybe one day another network will pick it back up and continue the series.
4,Great Show,Enjoyed the show... I never saw this at the time it came out and someone told me about it. Enjoy
5,This book will allow you to avoid gall bladder surgery... no kidding!,"My wife used the VERY simple directions in this book to pass her gall stones. In one evening, her gallstones came out... a handful! It's not painful, it's not difficult, nobody makes money on this cure except the guy who's trying to get $85 for this very slim volume. He must be joking!Visit this website where you can read a very good description of the method, and buy the book for less than $13.00:http://www.relfe.com/gall_stone_cleanse.htmlI don't have any dire symptoms, but will follow the book myself as soon as I get the chance... my wife was glowing after the stones were out, and said she felt GREAT."
3,Lid was broken,"Delivery was quick. However, when it arrived the lid was completely broken even though it looked securely wrapped in bubble wrap. Very disappointed that the product was damaged."
5,LOVE THESE!,"These baskets are awesome! We have a really strange shower without much space around the tub for bottles etc. Just a towel rack inside the shower, which is the perfect place to hang these. I bought two- one for the rack and one for the curtain rod- I was initially worried that the baskets would swing too much on the rod but they definitely stay put. There are drain holes at the bottom of each basket so they don't fill up with water and soap goo, and they're deep so that bigger or heavy bottles don't tip the basket and fall out. There are suction cops on the back of each basket, and the top hooks are rubberized so they don't slip- which is a plus. I love them so much I bought a few more for friends and family."
4,HerbGirl,"Our large shower is enclosed with glass. Part of it is stationary, the other part is a swinging door. This organizer hangs well over the non-door part of the glass, and there are suction cups to help steady it. I wouldn't put it on the door part, though. I have one and have ordered two more to make room for everything. When not in use, I keep it all hidden behind a shower curtain; otherwise, it would take on more of a cluttered look. All in all, I like this product, but agree it doesn't seem like it would hang well over a shower head."
1,Cheap product,"I bought this and put it up in my shower. the chain snapped the next day.It looks nice online and in person, but the material is just not sturdy enough to hold even a generous amount of products."
5,Looks Retro in my pink bathroom,This item consists of three plastic baskets with holes in the bottoms connected by two chains up each side. At the top of each chain is a hook that connects to the shower head and the lowest basket has a suction cup to keep the whole thing steady. It holds enough stuff to start a Walgreens. I like mine pretty well.
4,So far so Good,"Love the shower caddy so far. I was looking for something to hang over the side panel of the shower, (nothing I've hung over the shower head has ever stayed or been staple). This looks nice and holds a lot of things. For our purpose it's been great so far. I would have given 5 stars, but I haven't had this long enough to judge it's ability to last and stay mold free..."
3,Not the most up-to-date,The mantles were not the most up-to-date which are more easy to put on the lalantern.
1,This author is crazy!,"Sarah Schulam relax, Rent is an amazing show and wasn't copyed from you. It was based on the opera la boheme and Jonathons larsons life. I can't belive how she could say such mean things about Jonathon Larson and Rent. To me Rent is one of teh most touching musiclas on Broadway. I'm only fifeteen and when i saw it i cried. I eman theater is my passion but when i saw Rent i thoughtr it was the most amazing thing ever put on earth lol jk. The way this book decribes rent made me want to puke. It was almost as if she hated the gay commuinty. I know she is entiltled to her opion but to say that Jonathon Larson plagorized off her was very dumb thing to say as i metointed be for it was based off the opera La boheme and off of Larson's real life. From what i know he had freinds with AIDS and freinds with drug adtictions. Sarah should have doen her ressearch before writting this."
1,"A Sad, Attention Craving Woman","I read ""Stagestruck"" due to the fact that I am a RENT fan and all the hype about her book and the similarities that it has to the story of RENT. Basically this woman hungers for attention and how dare she ""bash"" a man who isn't here to defend himself! RENT was and is an amazing show that not only won the hearts of millions but was an inspiration to many, including myself. Like her book is the only work of art out there that has a story about people living in NYC and having the same hardships as the RENT characters! Wake up people! I think she gives herself and her book way too much credit. Until Jonathan Larson can say that he ""stole"" the plot from Ms. Schulman, I don't believe a word of it."
1,BBC1 Radio Broadcast,"This is a live BBC 1 radio broadcast from 1973. It has 10 songs and is about 55 minutes. Most of the songs are around 4 to 5 minutes, except the first and last track that are 9 minutes each. The sound quality is OK but not great. It has that head banger live quaility to it. There is only a little audience clapping at the beginning and end of each track.Nazareth is a heavy metal band from Scotland. They had a couple of hit songs when heavy metal was big in the seventies, but they never really made it big. They always did a very nice version of Morning Dew.This album doesn't really contain any hits. I found the playing to be mediocre. There are a couple of ballads that are nice (every heavy album has to have one or two ballads). But the only track I really liked was Morning Dew.To calibrate, I am not a huge heavy metal fan. The hardest I get is Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin. So, someone with a better appreciation for the heavy metal art form may like this better than I do."
5,The best tea anywhere!,"I purchased Ahmad tea for the first time on a recent trip to England, and our whole family enjoys it immensely. Ahmad is about the best tea we've ever tasted. This green tea is excellent and turned some family members from ""no thanks"" to ""where's my tea?"" every night! Even the boxes are a work of art.If you like tea, don't be put off by the seemingly ""large"" size of the package. We're already halfway through our second case and showing no signs of slowing down.An excellent tea at a great price."
5,nifty wok,"This is a small wok but it heats evenly and the nonstick surface seems quite sturdy; it cleans up easily. I like to have it on hand to use in tandem with my big iron wok but it's also great for whipping up small portions with less cleanup. Consider getting a nylon wok spoon with it, you won't want to use a metal spatula."
4,Better than Walmart!!,"Great pan,I bought one at Walmart,after a week it started to peel,I have had this for a month and use it 4 times a week and no signs of any problems!"
4,Eh...could have been better.,"I loved all the previous books in the Emily series! I like this book too; however, it was a little slow and didn't have much of a plot. The cover and the title didn't have anything to do with the book. Still an alright read for die hard Emily fans!"
2,A little disapointing.,"Long on the history, and available models.Short on the part that is important to me: Tips, Tricks, Jigs, and Fixtures to get the most out of my Biscuit Joiner.I'll keep it around, because it does give sources for some neat hinges, and knock down joints. But, it will never be in my top twenty woodworking books list."
2,I don't recommend this product.,"Product: I didn't care for it as the pad is hard plastic and you can't place anything on the pad, like a soft blanket. There are other heating pads that are made to go under blankets or pillows. I returned this and got the other style.Seller: Arrived quickly, in good condition, return was hassle free."
1,Cats avoid it,"It does get warm - but the cats just don't want to go near it. Tried Feliway spray, changing locations...they don't like it at all. They'll walk round the edge rather than even step on it."
3,Extreme Weather Kity Pad working fine!!,"I only got this pad a little over a month ago. It was exactly as advertised. I have it out on the porch for the cat when it is cold, and so far it seems to be working fine."
2,Not impressive,"I was expecting a bit more warmth and comfort from this product. The plastic is very hard and if you put a cover / towel, etc over the plastic, there is very little heat that can be detected when the cat is off the bedding. It seems to be very little benefit when most of the heat is generated from the body heat of the cat, not the pad. The electric cord was very sturdy for a cat, but the prduct is really not useful. I did return it to Amazon without a problem after about a week of trying with and without the towel over the hard plastic. My cat did sleep on it, with the cover over it, but seemed to defeat the purpose of a cozy, heated pad - which this is definitely not."
5,My cats love them,We live in the country and have a few rescued cats that couldn't be housebroken. In order to keep them warm in the winter we use large clear Rubbermaid storage boxes and place these heaters inside. We keep them up on our porch out of the weather. The cats can see outside of their little homes and stay nice and warm. I would definitely buy these again.
4,Great but two small flaws,"I hate to break this product's string of five star reviews but mine has two very small problems. It's stiff plastic but it's not flat so it rocks when placed on a flat surface. Cats hate unstable surfaces so I had to pad the bottom with a towel.The other problem is that the bottom is slippery so if you put it on something like a coffee table, it will slide when the cat jumps off. Again, setting it on a towel more or less solves this problem. It seems like this product could solve both problems with soft rubber feet.Once these problems were solved, my cat was like a moth to flame to this. Five minutes on this thing and he's out like a light. He was sad when his previous heated bed, my old VGA monitor, was replaced forcing him to sleep at room temperature. This probably doesn't crank out as much heat but he likes more than laying on my bed. The heat is very even across the entire pad and you can even hear the pressure switch turn it on to high when you press down on it."
4,heated cat mat,"I bought this item to put in a cat house for kitty to have some place warm to go. It seems to work well as long as the outside temp remains moderate and does not get near freezing. The heating unit seemed to stop working when the temperature dipped around the middle 30's. The cat though does enjoy it it seems, she doesn't leaver her house unless its time to eat or there is warm sun light to lay in. Would recommend this product."
4,Clear and concise tutorial for the 24-form.,"This light-weight handbook is a clearly illustrated and concisely written guide to the 24-movement Tai Chi Short Form. Recommended as an easy-to-understand workbook for those learning, or wishing to learn, this popular form of taijiquan."
4,Interesting read for super beginners,This is really good read if you have never been exposed to Tai Chi. It does not explain though what type of style the forms come from but I believe they are the ones that were released by the Chinese government. Good to start practicing Tai Chi with as a ultimate beginner or an enthusiast.
3,24 forms--not my learning style,"This is a very detailed book on 24 forms tai chi., but it is still a book and therefore two dimensional. I found that I cannot wrap my mind around the pictures and need a three dimensional learning tool. For those who can learn from diagrams, this should be a very useful and inexpensive tool."
3,....,who ever find it helpful and easy im glad for u because I dont they need to do away with the whole clock thing as well it's confusing and a pain in the back side!
3,So-so,"Gayle Callen and Julia Quinn released books on the same day. I picked up both of them, and it's clear that this one is better than Quinn's. Unfortunately, it's just an average romance. The theme of one man replacing another's position in the aristocracy and fearing discovery by the heroine is a well-worn plotline. The hero and heroine are likeable and well-drawn, and Callen is a competent writer. However, she can't put a fresh spin on this tired premise. I'm willing to buy her next book, but here's hoping she finds a new direction."
2,TrippLite Touch Master Plus,The unit functions fine but is not the quality I would expect from TrippLite. The case and switches are cheaply made. The outlets are too close together to plug in anything other than a standard cord. (Transformers from various computer devices either have to be plugged into extention cords or block more than one outlet. Since many computer peripherals use transformers this seems like an obvious improvement that could be made to the unit.)
1,List of songs required,"Unless we see the list of songs, how do you expect us to buy a DVD ? I have rated it low because I do not know the contents"
1,Dont waste your money. Innacurate,"The most important thing about a thermometer is its accuracy. I checked my baby's temperature and it said 98 degrees. So I was not so worry. Thank god, my mother was with me and she touched the child and said he had fever. So, I tried my $7.00 thermomether and sure thing, he had 102 degrees. I paid over $35.00 for this thing that its worthless and DANGEROUS to your child. Too bad I cannot return it, but at least I'm taking the time to write this and save you from a possible bad experience."
1,Scarey Device,"This thermometer has NEVER gotten the temperature correct. It always guages up to 10 degrees too low. That is scarey to me. I never use this device. Last time I did. It said I was 96 degrees. But I was 103, and soooo cold. It does the same thing to the baby. So I don't trust it. I usually am very fair in my reviews, but this is really the only bad bad bad baby item I have. Go with a better brand."
5,Disagree-Awesome Themometer,This thing is AWESOME. As a first time mom I want everything best for my baby. This themometer is very accroate. I dont know what the other reveiwers are thinking.
4,Satisfied,"WinTV works fine with my computer. I have an XP Media Center edition. Honestly, their software is iffy. I couldn't get it to work properly. In fact, installing their software screwed up my system... as it replaced a necessary file preinstalled on my desktop. The WinTV customer service guy explained that it was a ""Dell"" thing, and instructed me to uninstall their software. Apparently, all I was to install was the hardware Driver. With just the driver installed, I can watch TV through Media Center. Their software is unusable/unstable on my computer. But, all in all, the product works well through Media Center. I'm happy with the product.But, for all you Dell computer people out there... here is a warning... this model of WinTV will probably require some customer service support. While, I've heard that others have had problems with customer support, my encounter was succinct, professional, and did fix my problem."
4,win tv usb,installed and ran great at first. After a few days did not respond at all.I tried installing newer drivers but it kept hesitating so i tried to install all over again.I had problems trying to install it again but after quite a few times it did finally install with original drivers again and has been running very well again.I would recommend this product but it could have a few bugs but is worth the effort.
1,I'm Not Impressed,"I have installed the Wintv-pvr-usb 2.0 twice now using the supplied CD and downloading the latest software from the Hauppauge web site.I have yet to get it to recognize any TV channels, it simply can't find any. The FM Radio portion works OK, but no TV.Support from Hauppauge is non-existent, they will not answer any e-mails to the support address.I am just about ready to box it up and send it back.UPDATE 1-5-2006After a week and a half support finally gave me a set of instructions with a specific order for loading the drivers and the thing now works. I haven't done much yet but watch a few TV programs and record a couple of shows and a TV movie, but it seems to be working now."
1,Mine failed,"This is a neat little product with promise, and for a while it worked fine. The software and remote are passably user-friendly, and hey, it's TV on your computer. But about three weeks in, my lower channels (the ones that matter) inexplicably started showing static so severe that TV became unwatchable, and things have remained that way ever since. Worse, Hauppauge takes no responsibility for their defective product, claiming that since I bought mine on Ebay (even though I bought it new), their whimsical warranty didn't apply to me. That's $150 I'll never see again."
2,Disappoint product for the hype,"Was hoping that this would be a great product from a very well know company in the industry of tv tuners as well as for the mpeg 2 compression in the box but was extremely disapointed in the results. The audio video sync was off as well as the video was glitchy. I dont recomend this for the laptop user nor the desktop seeing as it wouldnt even work on it, in fact it wouldnt boot with it attached."
2,Title misleading,"For me, this book was neither wild nor wicked, but insipid with the main character hard to relate to. Usually I read the reviews before purchasing, but found that the rating did not reflect my own opinions."
4,Lessons in Raja Yoga,"This was a great find. Besides the fact that it's free, this work is written with one thing in mind, the attainment of the reader. Not many philosophical or religions literary contributions focus so much on exhibiting love and understanding. At about half-way through, I really felt that I was absorbing knowledge and was beginning to really understand the precepts of raja yoga and tantra. If you're interested in the tantric way of being, need a little beginner's guidance and have a kindle (phone, tablet, computer, fire) this book is for you.I give it 4 stars only for the lack of illustration, which I believe may assist in visualizing some of the concepts.All in all a wonderful addition to the library!<Jonathan>"
4,Intriguing / Insightful novel about Vatican Politics,"I have always enjoyed Morris Wests novels. His grasp and understanding come from an insiders view of how the church operates and its relationships with people and governments. He is wonderful at developing great characters so this book will not disappoint you. He makes two significant assumptions in trying to make this a "" real "" (in his eyes) portrayal of the church, namely that the present pontif regrets his stronghanded conservative stance on the church and that a church, riddled with conservatives will entertain the choice of a moderate for the next pope. These are big jumps that I am not sure everyone is willing to make and thus the ending is somewhat unreal. Most readers are probably not this critical nor are they knowledgeable of the running of the church as West is and therefore might make the jump easier. Neverthrless, it is a good read and will certainly keep your attention to the last page."
5,a surprising find,"I really enjoyed this book. I was disappointed at first because I thought it was an anthology of ""Hollywood"" stories. But it is a series of essays regarding different aspects of Hollywood and its influence on American culture. There are short passages from books and magazines and an excellent bibliography if you're interested in pursuing the subject.I found the book very well written and very interesting. I plan to keep it as a reference and to enjoy every once in a while, the writing style is so good that I know I'll enjoy reading the book again in the future."
2,Pin 9 is missing. Is older technology,This cable is an older cable. Note pin 9 is missing. This cable doesn't conform to VESA DDC2. For some plug and play it may not work. Also Display power management may not work. It was overpriced for old technology.
1,Not a good reference for Active Server Pages,This is a very frustrating book. Many of the examples in the book are incorrect and can lead to some long development cycles if it is used as a reference for working with Active Server Pages.Que should pull the book from distribution until the authors can correct the information.
1,SLOW START,"This book provides a very slow start. If you want to learn ASP in a flash and are familiar with Visual Basic, this book is NOT for you"
3,Italian Opera CD,"This was advertised as a salute to Robert Merrill. It is not, it a collection of Opera stars and more arias are sung by Victoria de Los Angeles than anyone else which is okay because the recordings are superb. I would be a bit more specific in the future."
2,Not a good choice.,"To the contrary of one of the other ratings, I think if you are new to opera, this is NOT the CD I would recommend as an introduction. While it DOES have many of the very well known, it is, in my opinion, very poor quality, done by people with hardly any feeling for the music. They are good singers, but that's all they are doing. Hearing someone sing words is much different than hearing someone accomplished sing the soul of the story. All in all, a very boring, poorly done CD. I guess you get what you pay for though. I just recived mine yesterday, and will probably return it. If you are new to opera, I would suggest Pavarotti. The 2 star rating is because the orchistra was good."
4,Great first set of clubs,"Great first set of golf clubs for the new golfer. These clubs gave me the versatility to try out woods, irons, and the hybrid, while still giving me the basic clubs for a round of golf. Can't go wrong with the price. Plus they're cute!"
2,Big disappointment,"I looked forward to reading this book but found little of interest. For each of 31 serials, none of them ""hard sf"" despite the subtitle, Kinnard lists credits and cast, story, and comments. Often the story (a nearly unreadable plot summary) exceeds 42 column inches (as for MANHUNT OF MYSTERY ISLAND)--- for no known reasons--- while other serials get less than 6 column inches, with no rationale. I suspect the insanely expanded plot summaries were added to bulk out a very slender book-- less than 200 pages of text. Comments on the serials are repetitive and tend to lack insight or specifics. For instance, the gross overuse of rear projection in FIGHTING DEVIL DOGS is not mentioned. Misprints are few but often hilarous, as ""Mephisto lashes Brand with a ship and stalks out of the room,"" on p. 111. There are odd errors, particularly phonetic spelling of character names!"
2,Not as advertised.,My grinder arrived with a plastic blade instead of the metal one advertised. I called Right Start and was told I would have to pay the shipping fees in order to exchange it so I gave it away and left feedback on Amazon. Someone at Right Start read my feedback and issued me a full refund for the product which I thought was pretty nice of them since I can't return it.
1,Crushing with your bare hands is easier,"Please do not pay money for this device. I have nearly popped a blood vessel trying to grind food. It becomes at times a two person job, it does such a poor job with anything firmer than a very ripe peach. The rubber gasket is hard to remove and thus food particles will cake into the crevasses in a very disturbing and unhygienic way. There is no metal blade as the pictures suggest. It is a piece of grey plastic."
4,Picky baby food eater,"While my son is still picky about the consistency of baby food, he does eat it. Which is great. In addition I will also say this is a very easy to clean, use and store baby food grinder."
1,1/2 the price 1/100th as good,"Flimsy! We had one handed down to us from another family. I retired it after the 2nd time spilling food all over due to its poor design. First spill -- top plate pops off -- apparently the installation of the top plate is very particular. 2nd spill -- the bottom plunger action is sticky and doesn't have a 'stop' before coming all the way out the bottom.Doing a quick search on ""food mill"" I see that regular kitchen food mills start at round $20, going up to $70. I can't imagine a real food mill being of this shoddy."
1,Terrible product,"This so called grinder was a big disappointment. The blades are dull, the part withthe handle falls out often, if you put the rubber washer in as instructed it's too hard to push down. I waited three weeks to get it and spent alot on shipping as I live out of the country. From the picture it looked like a food grinder I used with my daughter in the late 70s, and I wanted to get one for my grandson. It may look like the grinder I used way back then, but when it came it was a very inferior imitation. If anyone can recommend another baby food grinder that actually works, please let me know. I've never written a review before because everything I've bought on amazon til now was great. There's a first time for everything I suppose. :-("
3,"Good Maurice Andre, bad others","Maurice Andre's playing is great, however he only plays on the last two pieces. The other players are not as good as Maurice, but their interpretations are still intertesting."
2,Hirokin,HirokinThe film could have been a lot better if story was clear. The characters did not come across well at all.
2,"A ""B"" movie at best",I rate this film low (2) because it was disconnected at times and the quality was below the standard of action films that I enjoy. There was a good story line but lost in translation to me through the film. But more sadly was its predicability. I would not recommend this film to a action film enthusiast.
5,Profoundly Enlightening,"Not the fast-paced quick-cut type of documentary that is common nowadays, but if you are looking for an understanding of the profound implications mythology has in your everyday life, this series is for you. Bill Moyers leads Joseph Campbell through six hours of discussions that will surely change your life. Awesome!"
3,Beware if you use a heart rate monitor...,"Overall, it works good. The cadence, speed and distance all seemed accurate and are generally reliable. But it does have several big limitations:1) Doesn't work with a heart rate monitor: The signal from a heart rate monitor interferes with the computer's wireless reception. So if you are using a heart rate monitor, the computer doesn't work. Since there's a good chance you use a heart rate monitor if you are willing to spend this type of money on a bike computer, I consider this a serious limitation.2) The menu system is definitely not the most user friendly. In terms of when you're on the bike, most of the info is easily accessible. But you definitely need to break out the manual when you want to adjust any settings."
3,Inventive Stories,"This book is filled with wonderfully inventive stories. It was especially very interesting to read the original versions of ""Minority Report"" and ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale."" However, I felt the story telling itself was rather low quality. It may just be the times - story telling style changes over time, and these stories are told in a manner similar to other popular science fiction writers of the fifties and sixties. I found the stories to be internally repetitive, and the comma usage made the story flows awkward."
4,very good movie,"I only order movies I like, and these are all excelent movies that help me kill time in the winter."
4,great,"if you have never had a bike computer, you'll get hooked on this thing! cant ride without it. would give it 5 stars but it froze on me once,found that by rubing sensor with magnet it came back to life."
3,Speed Cable Ripped on Installation,"Computer looks nice and sets up fairly easily. However, my speed sensor wire ripped on installation. Now, I have a $35 cadence sensor. If you have the money, get wireless. That's what I'm going to do once I have the cash."
2,Button Confusion,"I had a Cateye computer for one of my road bikes years aago and needed a new one so I just thought this would do the trick. Had the bike shop set it up on my new ride and proceded to dicern the button/ menu sequence scheme. In short, I never ""got it"". My ride was always one of wondering which button do I access to go to ""clear"" time or access odo or clear odo.I eventually returned the computer because when I'd ride at night I put myself in danger off crashing several times as the screen light just wasn't enough to do the job. Finally, decided to try the Sigma brand and it has done everything perfectly..it has an intuitive interface,great light and button sequence. And I no longer feel like an idiot!"
1,Great idea -- unrealistic tolerances,Excited to get my new Cateye Cycle Computer with the cadence feature. Be forwarned that to have it work the magnets that attach to your frame and spokes need to pass within 3mm of each other or you will not get any reading on the unit. For the life of me I could not find any way to rig them on my bike to get anywhere near that distance. In calling their tech support they agreed this probably will not work on anything other than the narrowest of racing bikes. It would have been great to see that fact illustrated in the product description on Amazon or from Cateye.Back it went to my disappointment.
3,Could have used more postage!,This movie was as expected being rated 3 stars. I wanted to see some well known actors of today in their earlier roles when they were not so well known. It was interesting.
4,Home Decor,Neede to redo closets and this book was the best. My friends were amazed at my closet and could not believe i did it myself. Instructions were easy to follow.
4,A Wealth Of Information,"I like the Physician's Desk Reference because it contains a wealth of information. It's perfect for looking up drug interactions, uses, dosing and adverse effects among other things. This is a great reference tool."
2,Look good until you try to put them on,"I was looking forward to some great sound with these headphones but there are several problems:1) these are around the neck headphones - not over the head and they are not adjustable so they stick out the back. They dont sit comfortably and those comfort rings dont seem to help2) if they manage to fit your head, once you put them on they sound crap. they are fine in the middle frequenceis but upper frequencies are not impressive and they are missing alot of sound in the lower freqsThe only thing these headphones have going for them is that they look like they are made sturdy and look cool. But since they dont fit me nor sound good they are going back."
1,Unreliable,I have had this computer for about 6 weeks. I use it on my mountain bike. I find it to be unreliable. After one ride it said that my maximum speed was 96mph. A few weeks later it reported a maximum speed of 74mph. I have never gone faster than 30mph! Another time it completely reset itself to the factory default - all data gone. This happened overnight while the bike was sitting in its storage closet. A friend bought the same computer a week after me. She has had similar problems. I'm returning the unit. So is my friend.
4,Just what I wanted,"I got this to replace an old Cateye Mity 8 wireless that I've used for about 10 years. The Micro appears to be the updated model of my old favorite with a few new features thrown in. It works just as I expect. Now, I hope it lasts like I expect.The only reason it didn't get all five stars is because of the price. The old version was pretty inexpensive for many years, and this new model pushes that price point a little. If it lasts, it's worth it, though."
4,"Once it's on, it's great","Clear display, easy to use. Installing the transmitter was too tricky for something so simple. Instruction sheet was not helpful. Good value for $30."
4,This is a fine product,"This product is pretty good for the price. I use it as a secondary unit to track the time and miles I put on my trainer. It has worked fine so far. You need to keep in mind that the rage of the unit is limited. you cannot mount the device on the handle bars and the sensor to the back wheel. That distance is too large for it to sense. I placed the unit between the handle bars and the seat. It works fine there. I usually take it off when I go out to ride. It has a lot of functions too, which I ofcourse do not use."
4,Device great Instructions Looser,"I have the Strada and now this device, both great devices.The instructions; really are the only reason why I write this.My gosh! they need to be re-written. The diagrams don't even match what is on the monitor's display. 90 minutes from start to finish installing and setting up. I too do IT support and run and enter energy management programs for a hotel..."
4,Solid performer,"This is an excellent product. Feels solid. Once you figured out how to useit this is easy to use. BUT, as remarked form others the manual is mostly useless."
5,SIDRAN IS AWESOME,"One of Ben's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
1,Horrible,"These made my face break out after two weeks. Not a good product, for me. Everyone is different. Maybe you will have a different experience."
5,Outstanding video for a variety of ages!,"This video captivated a group of seven 5-7 year olds with it's non stop action and positive, wholesome presentation. It was a video we could enjoy, as parents, right along with our children."
2,Average Printer,"I've had this printer for 10 years and it had served me well until i upgraded to Vista, after which I started getting 'printer off-line' messages often. If you have XP or an older type of Windows system, then you should be fine. I'm also puzzled as to the price Amazon is charging for this printer, since it is in the same class as HP1000!"
3,It's different...that's for sure,"OK, these guys sound pretty cool...but they will only appeal to certain people. I'd have to say they are like a harder The Network maybe, with a little bit of Swing. They have the same synthesizer stuff going on as Horse the Band or An Albatross..the singing is good but you can't understand it due to the voice changer the singer uses. Overall, a pretty good cd..Also have a slight bit of Jet in them which is kinda cool..pick this up if you are pretty open-minded and like The Network."
2,Different versions of a same song,"Les 5 premiers titres sont des versions diff√©rentes d'une mme chanson, plus une 6√®me chanson en suppl√©ment. Si vous souhaitez d√©couvrir Zero 7, vous devriez plutt acheter ""When it falls"" ou ""Simple Things""."
3,Needs a good proofreader,"This book is full of useful information couched in terms that even less technicalpeople could understand. However, it suffers from a barrage of typos. For example,on pages 91 and 92, the authors can't decide whether they're talking about the '/'(solidus, slash) or '\' (reverse solidus, backslash) character. Another persistentirritation is the fact that the authors labour under the misapprehension that URLstands for Universal Reource Locator, and not Uniform Resource Locator. Thiserror crops up in the text and the index. It really should have been picked up bythe editor or proofreader. It really is a pity that these problems made it all theway through to publication, as the book has some useful insights, some of whichare obscured by these errors."
4,Good sound for a good price,I really like the subwoofers. They are a good quality and I got them for a good price. My friends enjoying hearing them also.
1,I'm very Disappointed,I doesn't fit to my 2009 acura tsx.My original blad size is way bigger than this item.I'm returning this item today.
4,Life saver!,"When you are knee deep in slides and your eyes are too tired to look through your microscope, Wheater's Atlas will be your lifeboat. Use it and learn all you need to know. I can't say enough good things about this book. Viva Wheater!"
4,Very Good For a Newbie,"Hagstrom's The Essential Buffett is key to understanding successful investing strategies. However this very helpful book is not just about why Buffett makes his choices, but, how Buffett's thought process in deciding to pick a stock has come to be. Besides the genius of Buffett, the reader learns about stock market guru's Ben Graham, Philip Fisher and Berkshire Hathaway's vice-Chairman Charlie Munger. Hagstrom's examples of the companies Buffett has been with like: Net Jet, See's, Coca-Cola, Citigroup... teaches young investors Buffett's investment ideaology. Because Hagstrom uses assumptions and multiple mathematical examples to prove HIS own application of Buffett's investing style to tech stocks, The Essential Buffett is not a five star book."
4,My son loves it!,"Before I made this purchase, I read the review of a lady having both the Fisher Price table and the Leap Frog table. I agree with her that the FP table is more appealing to babies. (We were at the doctor's office and they had a LF table in the waiting room). The tunes with the LF table is more geared to the adults and it does not have the silly sounds that the FP has. My son loves to turn the bowl on the FP table. And there seems to be less items on the LF table to play with. I'm glad I chose the FP table (not to mention the FP table is $10 cheaper than LF)."
3,Not Impressed!!,"I bought this toy for my 7 mo. daughter because she really likes noises and lights. She likes to play with it, but it isn't very sturdy with the legs on. It kept knocking over when she tried to pull her self up!@ We just let her play with it without the legs!! It's an okay toy, but needs improvement!!"
3,twin tested and found some things that need improvment,"over all my 11 month old twins love the table and even more so now htat it's on legs but brings me to the first issue is that isslides on tile floors and it tips over. since they are always pulling and pushing it form one side or another i've had to place it on carpet and keep a close eye ont ehm so that they don't fall.second thing is the apple keeps saying ""blue apple"" instead of red. Which is not a Big deal but it does get annoying after a while."
4,Great Vacuum,"I've been through 9 vacuum cleaners in 14 years! I've always had dogs, gerbils, fish, etc. My husband and I own a Nursery and we're always tracking mud home. We bought our current home 3 years ago and it's covered with off-white carpet! My job is very demanding, and I don't have much time or energy to vacuum. I needed something really special, but I can't spend $300+ on a vacuum cleaner! It took me a week to decide on this one. I found it at Best Buy for $118 and liked everything about it. I just used it for the first time and am VERY pleased. Of course, time will tell, but compared to all the other vacuums I've had, it's definitely a winner. For the price, you can't go wrong. It really sucks up the dirt too--wow!!! It's very easy to clean and maintain too. I don't forsee any problems in the future."
5,Great and powerful vacuum,"Great product. Vacuum is very powerful. The first time I used it, I couldn't believe the amount of dirt and dust that was picked up. The turbo brush attachment is very nice for cleaning the chairs, currents and sofas. Nice long cord to get the house cleaned quickly. One draw back is emptying the canister, can get a little messy."
2,Dust Bunny Issue,"DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM UNLESS YOU WANT DIRTY FLOORS! Essentially, this vacuum is first of all, bagless, probably the worst idea for vacuum cleaners in history. Second of all, I was shocked to find out that the vacuum would suck up the dirt and then spit it back out onto the floor. How useless is that? Again, IF YOU WANT CLEAN FLOORS DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!"
5,Great for small apartment,"I bought this vacuum a few months ago to use in my small carpeted apartment. It works great and I am surprised by how much dust and hair it picks up every time I use it. It is very easy to empty and keep clean. Though like any bagless vacuum, I've found that I do need to be gentle when removing the cup to avoid a dusty mess. I bought it while I was visiting my parents and tested it out on the wall to wall carpets in their house. They were so shocked at how much dust their old canister vacuum had left behind that they went out and bought the same model. They've been happy with theirs as well. I definitely recommend it, especially if you are looking for a light-weight cleaner for a relatively small space."
5,Excellent Value,I love this vacuum! I only have carpet in the bedrooms so I couldn't justify spending very much but I have a dog so I needed something powerful. This was the perfect choice. I am still amazed at how much dog hair it picks up. With my old vacuum I did not have to replace the bag once in the 8 months I have had the dog. With this vacuum I empty the container after every room. Obviously my old vacuum had no suction. I've already recommended it to several of my friends and even let them borrow it to see for themselves how great it is.The only negative thing I have to say is that it does tip over easy. I've been bonked in the head several times when using the hose.
4,Great suction!,"Great vacuum, we have had an hold bagged vacuum for a while now, and I didn't realize how much dirty it was not picking up, WOW! We had to vacuum the house at least 3 times in total to make sure we got all the dirt. You can tell the difference in the air as well. Only thing that this has a lil bit of an issue is dust is leaking, from where I don't know, the canister seems like it is in tight, might be from the extension hose that you have to use for the attachments. Weird design, but it is powerful.All-in all it's great, just gotta know how to use it."
3,It Could Be Better,Ever since I bought the Bissell Momentum it has been falling down. There's something wrong with the part that keeps the vacuum upright. The other features of the vacuum work fine.
3,Great for carpet but not for bare floors.,"Love this vacuum for carpet only. Do not like it for bare floors. When sweeping our kitchen/dining area which is ceramic tile, I can feel the dirt being thrown back at my legs. I can also see the dog hair blowing out the back of the vacuum base. I have the vacuum set on the ""bare floor, low cleaning"" position, all filters are clean, the dirt cup is empty and there are no clogs. I think the problem is that the rotating brush does not stop rotating. On my old vacuum, the rotating brush did not spin on the bare floor setting. I've gone back to the old fashion corn broom and dust pan for my kitchen."
5,What a great Vacuum,"I absolutely love this vacuum cleaner. I had no idea my rugs were that dirty, especially since I had just steam cleaned them. The amount of hair and dirt in the canister was amazing. Vacuuming has become an obsession since I purchased the Bissel Momentum 3910. My home smells cleaner and dusting has been cut to a minimum. The best purchase I have made in a very long time. Move over Dyson... this one only costs $100 bucksThanks Bissel !!!!"
5,Love this Bissell Vacuum,"I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering a new vaccum. I have tried higher priced & highly named vacuums but they didn't pick up nearly as much stuff as this one did. My rugs look so clean and feel clean...amazingly they look almost new.The dirt container is easy to clean and is washable which is nice. Another nice feature is it has a very long cord and moves around nicely. Anyone looking around, defintely consider this product..I have the Bissell Rug Cleaner which works wonders so I trust Bissell products."
4,"Good product, but bad handling during shipment.","The vacuum is every bit as good as other reviews state. The order took a bit longer than expected to arrive and when I opened the box the vacuum had a cracked handle. This was aggravating because I did not want to send it back and wait another two to three weeks for another one. It would have been better to buy the vacuum in a local store for an easier and faster return. This kind of stuff happens, so I just accept it as part of life. I tapped the handle up and went to work with it. Performance is not affected, so all is good."
5,An Incredible Acheivement!,"The definitive book for information on Greek films. This lavish book lists info on two thousand three hundred and two films! Each entry features the year of release, if it's in black and white or color, the time length, the director and stars of the movie, and a brief plot synopsis. Throughout there are black and white still photographs from various films. The appendixes list the ""Thessaloniki Film Festival Awards"" from 1960-1996, and the ""National Film Awards"" from 1984-1997. There is also elaborate indexes of names in English and Greek. If you have any interest in Greek films and culture, this book will immerse you in a cinematic journey of history that will not disappoint."
1,Conflicting Description,"Look at ""Product Features"" then ""Product Description"". In two places it says: 66"" for the pool diameter but the ""Manufacturers Description"" says 44"". Maybe that's why a couple of reviews said that the picture was misleading and the pool was smaller than shown.I rated it one star for the confusing data. I didn't buy the pool because I couldn't tell how large it was."
4,good pool,"good inflatable pool. nice size, adults can sit in there as well. it's not the toughest constructed in the world, but it's an inflatable pool-- just don't be too rough with it. perfect for use by myself and my toddler. you can fill it to a decent depth for adults, too (your legs and stomach wil be covered)."
1,Buy this if you want the WRONG size!,"So the tag on this specific item CLEARLY states 45"", and as per the previous reviews I received the WRONG size! They still haven't gotten this right. I bought this to be a ball pit for my LO as one of his xmas gifts, complete FAIL. I requested a refund and Amazon told me I can receive the refund and just keep it because I've been a good customer. Haven't even opened the darn box to see if this thing inflates. Whatev...."
3,Good until the valves leaked,"It was perfect for what we needed at first--tall sides and decently sized, however it didn't last long. About 3 weeks into using it, the valve for the middle ring developed a leak and would not stay inflated. Then about a week later the valve for the top ring also started leaking. Now it's mostly unusable, and not patchable."
5,Forbidden,Ilost my copy of this book in a move. I have read and re-read this book many times. I was so happy to see it available! I received it in just a few days. Thanks!
1,Huge Disappointment,"I own all three books in Lowell's Medieval trilogy and have enjoyed reading them a great deal. I purchased this audioversion to listen to, as it was my favorite of the three. I am completely dissappointed, The verbal affect appeared flat, not much, if any, intonnation to differentiate male and female characters. I couldn't get a good feel for the characters or their personalities, not to mention the fact the narrator sounds to young to be reading the book at her home alone, let alone for the public! When purchasing an audiobook that involves Saxons and Scotts, Northern England and Scotland, one would assume they will not hear a contemporary American voice. I couldn't even finish listening. It sounded too absurd. While I know the narrator did her absolute best, unfortunately the person who convinced Lowell to go with a young American voice to represent the voice of the Scots Hammer should have to face him on the battlefield! Someone really wasn't thinking."
3,Sh-Wipe Terry Cloths,These do not appear to be as thick as the original Sh-Wipe terry cloths and don't last as long but do the job.
4,Nice additon to a polar express train set.,The train car is exactly what you expect. It is just like the other polar exprees cars with different window shadows. That makes it unique and is a nice addition to the train set. It is also remider of the movie.
4,Good,The depiction of the waiters serving chocolate is well done via the silhouettes in the windows. It is a nice addition to the train.
2,Gross Disappointment,"Loved the first book - it's on my keeper shelf. This was a gross disappointment. I really was annoyed from the second chapter and intensly angered by the last chapter. Next time, I'll borrow a book written by this lady."
2,never take recommendations from internet groupies,this book was suggested to me by a person who raved about it. it was barely entertaining and poorly written. interesting main characters but even they need work.
4,A bit Confusing,"Not to give anything away but this book was a bit confusing. How a person can split and have two separate bodies in two separate planes is a bit much to believe. Other than that I loved this book and the introduction to new characters like Cyanna, Sam, and Gan; I hope they will be in future books as well. Cullen offering to have sex with Lily was hilarious!! Can't wait to read the next book."
1,1 step and it broke.,It was easy to buy.The vendor communicated very well.It shipped fast.It looked just like the picture.It was put together fast and easy.<<<< AND THEN IN BROKE AFTER A SINGLE STEP >>>>
1,Don't Pay Any More Than the Lowest Price You Can Get for This...,"I bought this despite the poor reviews warning me of the quality, as well as the implicit warnings of the low, low prices for used copies, because video of Yes in the 1970s is so hard to find, and I was hoping there would be at least one part to appreciate. Unfortunately the criticisms on the video and sound quality are, to be very generous, completely justified. If you're as much of a fan of Yes as I am, I'm sure that one more voice of warning here won't deter you from getting a copy anyway and seeing how disappointing it is for yourself any more than the voices before mine deterred me. To those I'm speaking of, I recommend doing what I did, and not pay any more than the lowest price you can get for the product and shipping. You'll be glad you did."
2,Terrific performance but poor DVD presentation,"This is a very tough one to review. I cannot argue with the blurb on the box about this being Yes at their peak and with their greatest line-up of all time, but the sound and picture quality of this DVD are extremely disappointing. It really does look like a cheap bootleg done on cine film and with a mono cassette recorder. This is a great shame, as the group are clearly giving their all to delight the ecstatic crowd.The highlights for me were the spirited rendition of Roundabout and the marvellous duel between Rick and Steve in the extended outro of Starship Trooper, which just about make this DVD worthwhile. The brutal truncation of The Ancient was very disappointing though. The commentary option is uninspired and will never get a second airing.Get it, if you're a die-hard Yes fan, but get it on sale!"
1,"Awful sound, really awful","There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the music. There aren't words to describe how bad it sounds."
2,"Great show, too short, bad quality audio and poor video","Are only 48 minutes of show, probably it was 2 hours long, the sound is too bad, the video is too poor, but it is a good show of Yes.Buy the DVD if you want to see Yes in the 70s.I never have seen them, and the video was better that never.Unfortunately they did not know that the video will has many buyers 20 years latter, other wise, they could have made it better.House of Blues has perfect sound and video, of course it has only a couple of years old, and Yes members are over 50 years old at this time.They (only 3 Yes fourmer) still play good music.Luis, CA"
1,Yes it was not a good DVD,When I started this DVD up I thought I was going to be in for a real treat. What I got was a trick. The DVD is in mono and the lighting is awful. The good news is that The Ladder tour is going to be released on DVD in April and it was recorded in high definition. This should definitely be a good one.
5,tormato,"I saw the dvd at a friends house, i thought it was fantastic....I miss that ""Yes"".. I saw that concert twice in 1979. There were sounds on the dvd that I never heard on the albums or at the concerts."
3,Great vintage concert unforunatley video/audio quality poor,"Having been an avid YES fan for years - I was looking forward to having this DVD for my collection. To my dismay, the filming was second rate and the sound mix was off. It was exciting to see the band in their '79 In The Round Tour - and to see the classic YES line up. The DVD release of YESSONGS is a better bet for picture and sound, or even ABWH's Evening of Yes Music Plus. YES-Live in Philadelphia is a must for die hard YES fans - for others, keep your fingers crossed for a release of their UNION tour on DVD."
2,Beginners Start Here,"The Mad Catz dance mat is intended to be used with Dance Dance Revolution, a popular video game that ""combines quick reflexes and timing with dance music"".That being said, it is difficult for serious DDR players to make use of this dance mat. The pad tends to slip during play, so you'll probably have to tape it to the floor. The sensors can't really take much abuse, so the arrows will probably stop responding to steps within a few weeks of heavy play.Note that the above only applies to experienced and skilled DDR players. This dance mat is fine for beginning players who want to test the game without making a huge investment for a better pad. You get what you pay for, after all."
1,This thing just stinks.,"This mat is really terrible. It just stinks, go for a red octane pad because this thing isn't worth 5 bucks!"
2,Hrm . . .,"Well, this certainly isn't the best purchase you could make. Soft mats generally tend to bunch up if you're really dancing hard on them, and this one is no exception. It doesn't pick up all of the steps you make, so you end up with a mediocre score. Of course, it can be modded to work better: just attach it to a large piece of plywood and it should work okay, but this mat is just not for those of us who intend to be *really* good at DDR. Good for beginners and occasional players, not for people who play in the arcades."
5,"OH, WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK!",I'M AMAZED AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TOUCHED BY THIS BOOK AS A CHILD. IT IS THE ONLY ONE I REALLY REMEMBER HAVING & LOVING WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS WONDERFUL BOOK &I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING TO GET A COPY OF IT!
2,REALLY BARRONS??,"I am in the process of reviewing and prepping for the Aviation Selection Test Battery for Navy and have been using this book extensively. While I would say 95% of it is correct, THERE ARE BLATANTLY INCORRECT SECTIONS AS WELL.One area that I noticed to be completely wrong is determining the mechanical advantage of pulley systems. Not only is his review incorrect, but also the answers the to pulley questions in the book. I recommend reviewing this section with physics websites online that will go over this specific material much more thoroughly as well as be correct."
2,Get an editor,"This book seems like it was cranked out in about 1/2 an hour. There are typos throughout, especially in the math section. The review sections are incredibly brief, especially the aviation section. The book goes into some detail about the subject, but the practice problems cannot be answered with the info in the book, making the studying worthless. Not recommended."
1,Mistake to get this book,I bought this book and found atleast 12 problems wrong in the simple math problem... these were simple problems that if the editor would have looked through would have found. Some of the problems didn't even have the correct answer for a choice!!! Do not get this book!!!!
1,Proof reader needed...Please contact Barron's ASAP!,"First of all, Amazon, you should have an option for ZERO stars...I bought this book along with the Arco and Cliffs Notes study guides, and I would have to say that it is unique. I have never seen an ""educational"" book with so many errors. If I would have purchased any other book with so many errors, I could have easily returned it. Barron's has not returned any of my many e-mails explaining the numerous errors that are not ven listed on the ""Book Corrections"" section of their web site.Please do not buy this book. You will save yourself a lot of time by purchasing a good, reliable study guide. Don't pay this much for kindling..."
3,Adequate,"This book is good to use in conjunction with other books to prepare for the AFOQT test. HOWEVER, there are quite a few wrong answers in the Mathematics practice and testing portions. Plan on correcting their work.For me, the point was to refresh my memory with the various subject matter. Spotting the errors became obvious after double checking my work."
4,peaceful music,"These women are incredible. They have pretty voices and wonderful, biblical lyrics. If you feel like you could use some more peace right now, get a copy of this cd. I like to play it at night while I fall asleep. It reminds me that God is always with me."
5,This is their best album ever!,"Their music is so inspiring. I love the song ""That's When I Find You"". It is so awesome."
3,M.C. is right....,"This is not a 'Complete' video collection. She had videos for 'Out for Blood' and 'Gotta Let Go'. Out for Blood was the sexiest Lita ever looked. She was jammin on her Warlock in tight black leather, fishnet stockings, and high heels. That was a video that kicked a$$.The footage of Lita is great. If you have been following Lita's career and buying her home videos, you have most of this stuff already.Highlight of this DVD is by far Hungry for your Sex. Lita in the water is as hot as it gets, but she gets your blood pumping in the junkyard with 'Larger than Life.""Lita rocks"
5,Best growing book for beginners I've read yet!,This is a totally killer book that helps beginners find a start place. A must have!!!
2,Not for educational purposes,"I was very excited to find a video about the life of Ernest Hemingway. What a great introduction for my eighth grade class before we began reading Old Man and the Sea...so I thought. I was very disturbed with the profanity in the video. After the first few ""cuss"" words, I was just looking for a section I could show, perhaps 15-20 minutes that were profanity-free, alas, it was not to be. Although Hemingway's work is peppered with profanity, I found it unnecessary for the video about his life to be littered with it. What a huge disappointment."
4,Silent vs. dubbed,"You don't need my review to know this is a great movie. I just wish we consumers were given the chance to purchase a version with just the music sound track without the additional dialogue. Perhaps it is just nostalgia on my part for the film I saw as a child but I find the voice in this version, which is that of Chaplin himself, at times superfluous and at its worse moments irritating."
5,another Pinkwater classic,"Author and illustrator Daniel Pinkwater dedicates this book to *good* librarians everywhere, and creates an unforgettable character in Lulu, librarian to some rather boring miners in Alaska until she grows tired of the grind and moves to New Jersey with her sled dogs Melvin, Louise, Phoebe, Willie, Norman, Hortense, Bruce, Susie, Charles, Teddie, Neddie, Eddie, Freddie and Sweetie-pie. But what to do about transportation? Aunt Lulu has an intriguing solution.Don't forget, Daniel Pinkwater writes affectionate, hilarious books for adults too!"
2,Too Heavy for a 2 Story House,"My daughter and I both bought the Bissell Healthy Home 5770 over 2 years ago. Hers has clogged, brush stopped working and now it smells like something is burning - yet she really likes it when it works. Mine didn't get as much use because I live in a 2 story house and after schlepping that monster up and down the stairs a 1/2 dozen times, I ended up using a portable vacuum upstairs and the Bissell downstairs. But even without having to carry it, it's bulk makes it difficult to maneuver. Emptying it was not easy and it is difficult to get all of the fuzz, etc. out of the tank. I ended up recently purchasing the basic model of the Hoover WindTunnel and it is so much easier to use, carry and store. It was also about 1/3 of the cost of the Bissell. I am sorry I bought the Bissell, but my daughter wants mine, and I will be glad to get rid of it."
1,Blahh! Terrible vacuum,"This is just an awful vacuum. I have had mine for 3 years. If you read all of the one star reviews you will see the same things mentioned over and over...so here it goes. This thing is HEAVY. I mean HEAVY!! I don't even live in a two story house, but I still hate pushing this boulder around on one level. My roller brush only works intermittently, as well, so that makes it even harder to push. I can't imagine having to lug this thing up a flight of stairs all the time. Also, like the other reviewers said, it is a dirty mess to empty the canister. If you empty it over a trash can in your house (which you shouldn't do) dust billows everywhere, which is ironic. The other reviewers are correct in that you also have to take a stick or your hand and dig out what is stuck at the top of the canister. A truly awful product. The suction is just okay and I do like the length of the cord, but that is it."
2,Not good for pet hair.,"I just purchased this vacuum to replace our old vacuum that gave out. I have a Bull Mastiff and a Boxer, and even though we only have two area rugs, they are covered in pet hair all the time. I didn't want to spend the $$ on a Dyson, so seeing the pretty good reviews for this one, I decided to give it a try. Plus I had one of those 20% off coupons from Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I just put it together and used it - there is still white hair (from my Mastiff) ALL over my darker carpet. There was some hair and dirt in the canister, so I know it picked up some stuff. But our old crappy and cheap vacuum picked up all the hair on both carpets when we used it, and this one didn't even get half of it on the first use. I hope I can return it."
3,No Suction with the Tools,"Once my Hoover Windtunnel, after 12 years, became too loud for even me to stand, I decided to try the Bissell 5770. I'm sorry I wasted my money. Suction works great when using the floor vac in the upright position. However, the tools have no suction and I use them quite frequently as I have dogs. I have taken this one to my office to use, and have gone out and purchased another Hoover Windtunnel product. I am so glad that I did, what a difference."
1,Not worth the $$ you pay for it. Need an acct with parts dept.,We've owned this worthless vacuum about 3 years now. Unless you like replacing parts on your vacuum constantly I don't recommend this vacuum to anyone. The switch that turns the beater brush on has broke twice now. You have to buy a new handle to the tune of $40+ to fix it each time. For the amount of use it's gotten in the time we've owned it I find this totally unacceptable and will not be buying another Bissell product again.According to the parts dept. this is a common problem with these vacuum cleaners. Along with that it's top heavy and about took me down our stairs with it when I was vacuuming the staircase.I will be looking for a new one and I guarantee the next one won't be made by Bissell.
2,Poor Quality Canister,"I have owned 2 of these now, and managed to break the canister on both of them in less than 1 year. Bissell will not sell you a new canister, and these are too expensive to buy one as a parts vac. At least wally has a good exchange policy, because you will need it.On the bright side, it does clean well, and the hose is a handy feature. But the quality of the canister makes this product a $200 paper weight in the end because once your can breaks. Your done."
1,Becareful,"Took it out of the box, looked nice and easy to put together. Used once and the wheel fell off, it was on the system to begin with so no I wasn't the one that put the wheels on. It went back to Amazon. By the way, worked great on hardwood floors but little costly for hardwood. Hard to push on carpet."
1,BAD BAD BAD!,"For me and my family $279.99 is a lot to pay for a vacuum, but the reviews were good so I bought it... Big mistake. I have owned it for a year. In this time I have learned that there is a faulty wire in the handle that the people at Bissell have you fix yourself with there ""help"" over the phone. This vacuum is suppose to be for those people with allergies, but emptying the canister is a messy, dusty, disgusting project. It is heavy, and really picks up no more dirt than my old $69.99 Dirt Devil. If I could rate it no stars, I would...."
5,Great Vacuum!!,"After researching online for an affordable-great working vacuum, I came acrossed the Healthy Home Vacuum and after reading so many great reviews i decided to purchase it. After using this vacuum once, I was so glad i did decide to buy it! This is the best vacuum, I've ever owned! Great suction, Love the long power cord & it's Easy-empty bottom-release dirt container. It is heavier than my other vacuum, but it's not unmanageable! I'm more of a clean fanatic now, than ever! You can not go wrong with this vacuum."
2,Very HEAVY and LOUD,"I bought this vacuum from a home store, not this website because I had a coupon which made it cheaper to purchase. At the store it seemed kinda heavy, but I didn't think much about it and bought it anyway. However when I got it home and tried to use it it was SO heavy I could hardly push it. And all the weight is in the upper portion of the vacuum which you use to hold, not the bottom which goes on the floor. It was so heavy I could not see myself trying to vacuum my whole house with this vacuum. I was very disappointed with the weight and the fact that is was so hard to push/pull. It did seem to have good suction, but I didn't want to wear myself out everytime I vacuum, so I returned it. I do not recommend this vacuum, especially if you have back problems or are a small person. Also, this vacuum is very loud, not something I was expecting either."
1,Biggest Mistake We Made in 2007!,"Hate, hate, hate this vacuum!Too heavy, too tempermental, too much trouble for a vacuum!The power button for the beater brush is inconveniently placed whereyou accidentaly hit it when you don't want to.The brush only works intermittently for us at the present time.The power switch to the vacuum itself is also hit and miss!Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Who has time to play with a vacuum for five minutes before using it?The turbo brush falls off the ""storage area"", and needs to be opened and cleaned out way too often for my wants.Yes, it does pick up pet hair, but so does a cheaper one.Don't know if we somehow got a lemon, or if they all act like this, bottom line is:Biggest household mistake we made in 2007 was purchasing this vacuum!"
1,Trash,"This was a horrible, horrible album and I eventually microwaved the disc to prevent it from hurting anyone else. The electronic music was cheezy, too fast, tinny, whiny, and full of headache-inducing vocals. Don't waste your time."
1,Yawn!,"This is no less a waste of resources than is the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Insipid lyrics, constant whining and no capacity to ignite any sense of awe or passion in the listener. Katie's a standout track, though much as oil is to water when compared to the others offered.Compare this guy to David Gray? I don't think so."
4,Fire,"Set in Korea, some time in the nineteenth century, a young boy discovers the great responsibility of lighting the bonfires. When Sang Hee and his mother see that his father has not yet lit the bonfire, and see that there is no enemy coming from the sea, the boy takes up a responsibility that has been in the family for generations. He follows the path up the mountain to find his father injured and unable to climb the mountain. His internal conflict is against the temptation of satisfying his curiosity of soldiers versus responsibility. Good judgment outweighs his selfishness and the bonfire is lit. The systematic communication sends the message to the palace that the kingdom is peaceful. Park is an accomplished writer. The narrative is moving and interesting. The radiant colors of Julie Downing are well crafted."
3,All City's Metropolis IS truly Gold...,"All City comes hard with hypnotic hip-hop rythms, intertwined with various other genres of music. Jazz, light Reggae, and straight funk make their presence felt as the All City gang lace the tracks with in depth explanations of their money acquisition schemes. If there are any weak points, it's the albums focus on money. But who's perfect? Definitely a must by for any hip-hop enthusiast."
4,Very Nice,Computer is great. Nice functions and readable. Not happy with the zip tie installation. Would like to see something more adjustable. Overall very happy.
5,Good Stuff,"I bought this model so long ago that I'm not even sure when I bought it anymore. I bought this in 2005; still works. It has been through mud, rain, hail, extreme lows/highs, and it still works fine. Easy to program, easy to use. If I ever decide to buy another one it will be a Cateye. I don't have anything on my bike that has lasted as long as this, not even my bike as it's been through two bikes. If I remember correctly the mounting for the sensors came with tiny rubber bands, rubber bands don't stand up to the outdoors but I had no problem using zip ties instead."
5,oh show me the way to the next whisky bar.....,"Perhaps the myths of glamour and never ending hapiness in the music industry will soon be dispelled by reading Sugermans tale. Although we envy the glamorous life style, the theme so often touched on in this book, we realize the downfall and the end results when diregarding the future. Danny's story should be required reading for young people experementing with drugs. It also happens to be one of the most well written pieces I have read in a long while."
5,Haunting,"I picked this book up at a used book store. Afer reading it, I found my self thinking about it exessivley. It's so well-written and very descriptive. I could picture every scene from the book in my head. A very curious novel, as I had to keep reminding myself that this is someones life! I really enjoyed it and would definatley reccomend it."
5,extremly satisfing,This is a book you can't put down. It is very interesting & extremly well written. I give the book a big 10!!! I have read it several times and am ready to read it again.
2,We have to re-thingking the concept of the religion,"The Religion as the social concept and Transendental one, is probably discussed in the future. The Discussion is prefer use many disciplines and methodes, becaouse by this one, the re-thingking of the religion, especially Islam in this case, is merely quite right. Arkoun, although He was not the first man who preparing this concept of re-discus of religion, but He Was Gave the New paradigm of methodology."
4,a fun watch,Interesting movie from which to develop a series. It provided a number of story lines that could have been used in the TV series.
1,An Audio/Video Disappointment,"Meeting the Hamner family, learning some of its history, and seeing views of their hometown, on which stories of Walton's Mountain were based, were interesting. They are people, I'm sure, I'd like to know. However, the last third of this video is terrible: The audio and video break up, conversations are impossible to follow, and the quality is a great disappointment for the viewer.I would like to replace (if possible) or return (if necessary) this video. Thank you."
3,Great to see more on the Walton's!,"The Walton's Legacy is informative and entertaining. I only wish it had been longer. I still watch for anything else on the Walton's. I'd love to see a reunion again, although I know it would not even be close to the original."
3,OK,"Well I got the knife today and I'm pretty happy with itPROS:Sharptight fitCONS:plastic holderpain in the ass assemblymade in china (LOL)I'm VERY happy how soon it got here, great shipping speed!!:)"
3,not as big as you think,Got my knife today and was slightly disappointed. The knife is kid-sized. Finger hole grip was too small for adult fingers. Sheath was not the quality I expected.
5,pretty good,"My boyfriend bought this for a costume and it looks perfect for the costume. It seems like a pretty sharp knife and the sheath is rubber so I am assuming it would be very good for diving, which is what it was intended for lol. got here extremely faster than expected so overall good product and seller:)"
1,Cheap and Fake,"I have owned this Fury knife before, and liked its heft and balance. I expected the same when I ordered this. First of all, what I received was not a Fury knife at all. The country of manufacture was different than what was stated in the product description. The rubber on the sheath stunk to high heaven and had to be discarded. The clips holding the rubber straps were not belt like as pictured, but cheap plastic clips. Please sellers, stop representing your fake chinese copies as the real branded items, it is insulting to us and is a waste of time and energy."
1,no,when igot it boath the clips were broken i contacted the company and thea did nouthing bla bla bla bla
5,Alison Clarke for President!,"Everything you wanted to know about Tupperware but were afraid to ask. Entertaining, culturally illuminating and chock full of amazing photos, check it out...Tupperware ROCKS!"
1,Who are they kidding?,"This item is no good. I can only assume that the previous reviewer has never made tomato paste by hand before, because this device certainly does NOT perform well. It separates seeds, skin AND flesh; basically all one has left is 'soup'."
1,It does not work,"I bought the Screen Guard to protect my Palm TX.I tried to install the product following the instructions provided. It was supposed to come with an installation card used to press the screen to the PDA and to get air bubbles out. The Installation card was missing, luckily a had a card I could use from another PDA screen protector.After applying the Screen Guard, the left and right bottom edges did not stick to the screen even though I pressed them several times with the installation card.I tried to realign the Screen Guard. It was very difficult and complicated to lift the Screen Guard and reapply.During the process the card collected some dust on the sticky side and it was impossible to get rid of it.Finally I got fed and threw the Screen Guard to the waste basket."
3,"SHOES GREAT, SERVICE NOT!!!","I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THESE SHOES TO GO ON SALE, FINALLY THEY DO AND I ORDER MY SIZE BUT WHEN I GET MY SHOES THEY WERE THE WRONG SIZE, THE ORDER FORM AND THE BOX THE SHOES WERE IN HAD THE CORRECT SIZE BUT THE SHOES THEMSELVES WERE A HALF SIZE SMALLER.......SO WHERE IS MY SHOE!!! THE SIZE I NEED WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ONCE I ORDERED THEM...SO WHERE ARE THEY!!! I CALLED C.S. AND ADVISED OF THE ERROR AND WAS TOLD MY SIZE MAY/MAY NOT BECOME AVAIL LATE OCTOBER!! WHAT SERVICE, HAD SOMEONE QUALITY CHECKED MY ORDER I WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM."
4,Great for teachers,"There is no movie version of Frederick Douglass's Narrative in the Life of a Slave, but this worked wonderfully with teaching the book to my juniors. I recommend it highly."
1,Don't buy this product,"I bought 4 units of this product as Christmas gifts for myself, my wife and teenage kids. Three of them died within the first two months of very light use. I was successful in returning two of the units for a full refund, however, I'm stuck with one dead unit, and waiting for the fourth to die any day now. I got replacement iPod shuffles for the kids. The iPods have performed flawlessly for a number of months."
3,Good Side Dish,"Everybody liked these, even the fussy 2 year old. One package in the box was opened so we only got 11 packages for the price. I received a good value only because I bought using a gift coupon. Otherwise, I know they can be found much cheaper at the grocery store on sale."
4,quite good!,"howdy y'all,this is a rather fine, quick meal. i prefer it with sliced, grilled sausage and chuncked chicken breast added, but it is enjoyable on its own. quick to cook, easy to cook ... and it tastes good! [*grin*]rated a FOUR since it does all that i expected _plus_ it tastes better than expected.take care,lee"
4,Its getting better...,In this disk we find that Kira didnt die(go figure LOL) and that the earth alliance is getting ready to take on Zaft. Athrun is furious over Shinns actions and shows it in hitting him when Shinn comes bragging about his victory over the Freedom. Athrun and Shinn are offered new mobile suits and of course Shinn is excited over this. Athrun though is very troubled with the Chairman over his decision with destroying the Archangel. I wont say anymore...you will have to see it for yourself. It gets very good. This series is good so far but I don't think it beats the original Gundam SEED. 4 stars for this disk. Check it out!
1,"Locks up computer, cumbersome software","Installing the software for this USB adapter causes Windows XP home to lock-up continuously (to the point where you have to use the power button to shut the computer down). Multiple attempts to uninstall and reinstall yielded the same resutls. Also, the included software (which you must utilize), is slow and cumbersome. The US Robotics MaxG router is great, but buy a Netgear or Linksys USB adapter instead of this one and save yourself a lot of frustraton."
4,Another isbn-number with the same book,"This book is already reviewed at another place, but different publishers get different isbn-numbers, so my Jane's copy is reviewed here, and the Crown version is reviewed at another place (there are even more publishers who got their hands on this series). What can I add? This book offers you in large format some exellent artwork by spraygun virtuoso Rikyu Watanabe, who covers every bit of the plane in great detail, while Alex Vanags-Baginskis tells us a clear story of the plane's history.A must for modellers, and a basic reference together with ""Ju 87 Stuka, Classic Aircraft No.5, Their History and how to model them (PSL, 1977)"" and the legendarious ""Aircam No.46, Junkers Ju 87 Stuka (Osprey, ?)"""
1,Watch this so you have something to compare other bad movies to.,"I think the most interesting thing about this film, is that someone actually enjoyed it. Okay, it's not as bad as Smokey and the Bandit III, but it's in that same $1 bin at Wal-Mart. Seriously, there are better movies out there. I made it through about 30 minutes of this one. Don't let my sacrifice go for naught! Avoid this film!!!!"
4,Ya gotta love rrotoscoping to love this flick...,"An early example of Ralph Bakshi's rotoscoping technique. A cult classic, but not necessairily up to taday's standards in animation. This si the story of a time long after mankind destries himself with nukes. Prophetically, the film states thet it started when five terrorists detonate the first nuke. Hmmm... not bad for 1977. Anyway, the faries and other magical beings wake from a long sleep. Two wizards are born: one good, one evil. Long story short, they have a duel when their mother dies, and they are separated - the evil one into the bad, radioactive areas and the good one stays in the good areas he cleansed. Finally, after thousands of years apart, they come back together for a final, climatic battle. The Wizard duel at the end is worth the admission price and not what most would expect. ;) A cult classic and it's fun, but perhaps not for everyone."
4,WIZARDS,"This is an unique and entertaining animated story that any videophile/collector should own. A very early combo of a live footage/animation fantasy film. I'm not sure if many remember it but it can still be found so if you like unusual, good versus evil fantasies, it's hard to beat.I 'scored' a copy and watched it,,,,after years after it came out, and can't think of a better one done with (new then) effects. A mind-bender that all (I think) would enjoy."
2,not the one,"i read alot good review. and i bought it .... after i see it . i don't like it. it's very bored, and urgly ... if you like fantasy movie i hight recomment ""Ice and fire, sleeping beauty"" . it is fantastic beautiful draw for the movie. i keep watch it all the time not only the movie. because, it 's realy beutiful arts"
4,A Cool Sci-fi/fantasy Vision!,"I must have been 8 years old when I first saw this movie (strangley enough, the same age as at least two other reviewers.) I was stunned. It was the first violent, crude, and ""badass"" cartoon I had seen. I must have watched it at least 3 or 4 times again. I admire this movie mostly for its edge, panache, artisrty, and setting. There isn't anything quite like it. It has an enjoyable fantasy setting (Technology vs. Magic) and fairly eerie tone throughout, considering it roughly falls into the ""post-apocolypse"" genre. The only down side to Wizards? The sound track. C'mon, why do we have to listen to 70's disco music during battle scenes? Oh well, this movie is pop corn to me. I wonder where I can find it . . ."
2,Ugh,"Got this movie for Christmas...can't say enough bad things about it.The animation is often about as good as in the Smurfs (I.e., not that good), and it usually does not mix well with the retroscoping at all.The story's message is muddled at best. There is a strong peace and no technology message to it, until the end when the ""hero"" uses violence and technology to win.The ""hero"" of this story was supposed to be funny, but I found him incredibly unlikable. I liked the villain far more and was hoping that evil won at the end of this movie. Sadly, it didn't.For some reason you can see the heroine's nipples through her shirt. Then they put her in bandage where she struggles and heaves her bosums. It seems like the animators were horny. It didn't fit with the other elements of the movie at all.In all, I can't imagine watching this movie ever again. In fact, I'm angry that I bought it!"
4,Magnificent on DVD,"I have had and treasured a VHS tape of Bakshi's Wizards for many years, and transferred it to DVD when I was moving away from VHS. The improvement in clarity and color separation in this DVD make it worth every penny - and then some. I had really forgotten how good it is.Wizards"
5,Great Movie,"I saw this movie when I was like 6. I owned the movie and loved it. I still do now. I recently rented the movie and though there is Mild Violence, some Explicit Language, and Partial Animated Nudity it still is pretty good."
3,Great to have this film available . Not a great film though .,"I agree with the capsule review in Leonard Maltin's 2011 Movie Guide , ""**1/2 (out of ****) , Brando highlights great cast in study of anti-Nazi German who helps British capture cargo ship"" . ""Cast and Conrad Hall's photography are only assets"" . ""Script degenerates"" . Agreed . There's just too many fortuitous and implausible goings on to be a very good film , let alone great . I wanted to like the film a LOT more than i ultimately did . About mid way in , the film should make you groan HARD . it gets worse henceforth unfortunately ."
1,Lugubrious.... But In a Bad Way...,"It must be nice to have friends that will say anything, loquacious or not, to make a sonic school-project sound more important than it is... Actually, why am I even wasting my time with th......"
2,why is this book still in print?,"There might be some need for a book that covers intesively py 1.5.2, which I think was released in 1997 or so, but aside from that, you will read about code and libraries that are no longer maintained, or even available."
2,"Didn't work for me, but maybe for someone else.","I bought 10 of these. I'll have to exchange them, they won't fit my windows. I seem to have the hardest time finding anything to keep my vinyl new windows locked, it's like all things are made for old windows or something. Anyway, the pointed end of the screw can damage your window/paint as well."
1,Little Breviary,"I have a 1956 copy of this gem printed by J.H. Gottmer in Belgium and distributed in the U.S. by the Newman Press. I was looking for an identical copy to give to a friend when I was connected to this site. While I do not like Msgr. Knox's scripture translations, which my breviary contains, I still prefer it to the edition you're selling here and will continue searching for it because I want nothing to do with liturgical books up-dated by Vativan II ""scholars."""
1,took it back,"I bought one of these for my son and was very disappointed and returned it. I was looking for something low power, but enough so he could shoot targets in the back yard. This gun is made very cheaply, the mechanism is prone to jam and the bb's easily find their way out of the loading mechanism and into the body of the gun. When it did fire, the bb's would go only about 20' before curving off and I could probably throw them more accurately. Now looking for something else."
5,candy bars were in great shape and yummy!,"candy bars were in great shape when arrived, none broken, and tasted fresh and yummy! an old favorite."
5,A Readable Reference Book,"As most software developers know books like these are seldom an end-to-end read. They are usually kept on a shelf and pulled out when the need arises. That's why I was surprised to find myself continuing to turn page after page of Jeff's book. As usual, his writing style is concise, but has just the right amount of humor injected to keep it readable. What's more, his books tend to remain relevant long after they have gone out of print. I still pull out Advanced Windows NT Programming on a regular basis to reference. CLR via C# is chock full of the juiciests bits of .NET & C# 2.0. You'll learn tons, and be able to impress your programming buddies over lunch with your in depth knowledge of nullable types, generics and thread locking mechanisms."
4,Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash - All The Flash You Need!,"Unless you know you will be shooting flash shots from more than 40 feet away, this flash will do everything you need. I've added a plastic diffuser to mine which makes it perfect for walk around event photography. It's bright. It's fast. I love it."
2,Not intended for professionals,"We originally purchased this flash for my wife who didn't want a huge flash making her camera heavy while shooting 6 hours worth of a wedding/reception with me. However, if you plan on using this flash for anything other than horrible family shots, be prepared to purchase some sort of modifier (attachable softbox, bounce card, etc.). On its own, it's not worth much. We're actually about to send this back in exchange for another 580EX (that I currently shoot with). Spend a bit more and get a much better flash."
2,Slow recycle time,"Not only does this flash have a slow recycle time but you can't use the Canon CPE3 Compact Battery Pack with this flash. I really don't understand why. So if you're doing lots of event shooting, it's best to go for the 530EX and get the battery pack. This flash is best used as a slave to the 530EX."
4,bought 2 of themi,i bought it to add it to my ( studio )i needed small flashes in case of travelling
3,Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash,"I purchased the Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash as an accessory to my Canon 5D digital SLR. It is designed to couple with several Canon Digital SLR and does that extremely well. It even detects the focal length of my lens. I like the features and the way it couples to my camera, but I don't always get consistent results. It support sync speeds from 1/60 - 1/200 sec. I find that it works better with the camera in manual mode."
2,HARD TO WORK WITH,"I had this product for a couple of months before I actually used it. It was impossible to mix as directed. I had to knead it by hand. It is also nearly impossible to sand by hand. It's not only hard, but slightly gummy. You need an electric sander. Regular wood filler might not be as durable, but it's much easier to use."
1,Extremely unhappy with the service and product.,"1. Wrong model shipped without authorization.2. Ordered refurbished item, however item sent was well used and and in poor apearance. Luckily it was substituted item and returned.3. When I returned the wrong item I was still charged shipping and I had to proof that the item was returned and they received it. Luckily I saved the USPS bar code. Called on January 5th. and I was told that had not been received and yet the USPS confirmed that the item was received on December 29, 2006. Without that proof I would have you know what. I was not going to argue about the shipping cost for something that I did not order because I have better things to do.ONLY SOLUTION WILL NEVER BE ORDERING FROM AMAZON AGAIN. THANKS FOR FOR THE POOR SERVICE.Kenneth S. Singleton, DDS"
4,"When I Was 14, This Was Awesome","I remember this being pretty cool. I'm sure it sounds hokey now, but when you're 14 and just kinda getting into music, this was fun. Really paved the way regarding my musical taste. I soon went on to Mxpx, Five Iron, Supertones, etc. Obviously my taste has significantly evolved. But I'll always have a special place for Reality Check. If I recall, they were a hell of a lot of fun in concert. Used to have a kick ass poster of them as well. Good times."
4,Lots of potential!!,I bought this cd because I thought the samples were cool. But anyway. They have alot of potential. They have a sound of their own for sure. I wonder how they will improve on their next album. If there working on one. But anyway I guess it was a neat cd.
2,"As a parent, I don't appreciate Bulma calling Goku names.","The only reason I'm even considering buying this is that we've rented it several times and it would be cheaper to own it. Still, I'm not sure I want my kids to be able to watch this whenever they want. Several of the characters' attitudes are so condescending toward each other in a way that really reaches the kids."
5,Inspirational Conversions,As a 'born' Catholic it is a real inspiration to seethe difficulties that many non-Catholics have to overcome to enter the True Chruch. Their stories are wonderful.
2,I did not find this book helpful,"I was very unimpressed with this book. It seemed more an advertisement for other books than the instructional I was looking for. In all fairness, the instructions on how to make very simple beads were fine, but there were no illustrations and no directions on how to proceed after the simple beads were made."
4,Advice that needs to be aware of so we can seek the solution,"Kohn offers support of why rewards work and don't work. His book mainly points to the fact that they don't work in the long run as well as no reward. Many studies showed that when attempting something the success rate was higher 100% of the time for the ones offered no reward compared to the ones offered a reward. A highschool student ask him in a speech that he was giving on graduation day (paraphased) You want us not to live for rewards in todays society? What else is there? The Kohn admits he didn't have an answer for the gentleman and that he was depressed by this. I believe I have the simple answer to this. Live for basic needs, relationships, learning and self appreciation. I'm surprised he couldn't come up with that."
3,Tough Read,"Interesting perspective and insight. A really tedious read with lots of research, data, etc. Really wanted it to be clear and to the point with examples and ""how to"" ideas."
2,"Generic, Mediocre Pop Music From Great Actress","""What If"" is an extremely generic pop ballad that was obviously penned specifically as mood music from a film. Winslet carries the song well enough, but the truth is her singing voice is ultimately extremely generic. She is neither a particularly skilled singer nor does her voice has a quality that would make it unique from countless tens of thousands of other female singers. The difference is, she is a stunningly talented actress who is afforded the opportunity to try the avenue of music. The song will no doubt appeal to fans of bland, harmless pop, and Winslet's voice is pretty if nothing else. However, some of those higher notes escape her and lyrically, it's about as exciting and original as a piece of toast."
4,Easy on the Ears,"This is one of the better gospel albums I've heard in a long time. New Identity displays absolutely tremendous vocal talent, at lead, and in their harmonies. This album has 5 slow, and inspirational songs, and 5 upbeat grooves. Overall, it's just a must buy if you're an R&B or Gospel fan. New Identity is at a higher level than almost any gospel group has ever been on their debut album."
2,for the gourmet cook,"A nice-looking book and I'm sure the recipes are very good but they are just not conducive to everyday cooking. I was looking for recipies to bring more fiber and nutrition into my family's lives. Though the beans will surely do that..the recipes often have many unusual or expensive ingredients that I don't even know where to find (e.g., whole black mustard seeds, nasturtium flowers, nigella seeds, Madeira, 'confit of duck legs-?? etc). Other recipes require things like toasted coriander seeds, toasted allspice, etc. that take a lot of time to prepare. It's clearly written by a chef for other chefs or people who can afford the expensive ingredients, have access to gourmet food stores or to spend all day in the kitchen...not for the everyday cook. I gave it 2* - not because it's a bad cookbook...it's just not very usable to me...and unfortunately, will probably sit on my shelf unopened most of the time. =("
1,Did not work for large plantar wart.,"I purchased the box. Placed one on at night. Replaced it as soon as it fell off and did this for months and months and months. Now, this was a very large, very old (8 years) plantar wart. It had been surgically removed, or so we thought. It had been frozen (Ouch, Ouch, Ouch) several times. It had been duct taped for years. Apple cider vinegar morphed it into a huge 3.5cm x 4cm monster. It was happily spreading to other parts of my foot. Nothing really phased this wart. Right up until my doctor gave up and ordered Imiquimod 5% cream. (Outrageously expensive!) Two months later, I am wart free."
2,Not exactly well designed...,"A lidded metal mixing bowl is a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, after one trip through the dishwasher, the plastic lid no longer snapped on. There are similar bowls available from Williams Sonoma (more expensive, of course) that have recessed lids... making stacking and storage within the frige a much easier chore. These will do in a pinch, but simply are too low quality for a permanent home in my kitchen."
1,Ripoff 101,The above review mentions that the text jumps for no reason to a web design section and then goes back to Vita Merlini. The reason is these print on demand reprints that are trashing the book trade are printed on automatic pilot.I am sure they have no clue they accidently switched programs in the middle of printing.This publisher has the damn nerve to copyright a book he stole and does not give even credit or even mention the author John Parry!These people should stick to selling gold on television and stay the hell out of the noble book trade. Do you agree?
3,A Peculiar Extra,"This edition, at least my copy of it, stops abruptly on around p. 45, and inserts a booklet of some 100 pages on how to design webpages. After which, we return to p. 46 of the Vita Merlini. One might see this as a bonus, I suppose; but I have to say I didn't."
5,"""Camden, London, England gives birth to Ska - Madness""","In the late '70s and early '80s - Ska-revival was in the group from Camden - ""Madness"" - humorous, rollicking, fun, quirky, whimsical and good-natured. This British phenomenon, influenced future bands and was fast becoming the countries most beloved groups.Hip-O records, Pat Lawrence (producer), Dana Smart (compilation producer), Jim Phillips (mastering) and Ilene Weingard (art direction) have given the music enthusiast the ride of their life...entire album is awesome, outstanding and complete. Each selection of this 19-track compilation stands on its own infectious merit!Total Time: 71:33 on 19 Tracks...Hip-O Records 699...(2000)"
5,Always the best,I listened to this CD at least six time and will listen several more...He is one of wisest men I know on the subject of you.....Outstanding...A must buy for those searching for meaning of self.
2,Power of Intention vs Secrets of the Power of Intention,"I listened first to the Power of Intention, which was the reason I purchased the Secrets of the Power of Intention. I found the Secrets of the Power of Intention to be a long version of the Power of Intention, by far the Power of Intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more. The Secrets of the Power of Intention is BORING and makes you upset that you even purchased the set, it bring little to lite over the first disc. I would love to return the disc's, not worth the money."
2,Poor logic and writing,"Hoping to ignite good mealtime conversation and teach my children some reasoning skills, I began reading this book to my family at the dinner table. Once I reached chapter two, our conversation turned to how the authors used so many fallacies themselves. In the first two paragraphs of chapter two, where the lessons begin, they used three fallacies, one in the first sentence.The writing is also lacking. For example, these homeschooled authors improperly used ""which"" multiple times. As a homeschooling dad, I found it troubling that they displayed such a lack of basic skills.I gave the book two stars instead of one, because their ideas are solid. Their presentation, however, is sorely lacking."
4,missing a few sizes,check which size/sizes you need before purchasing. it's missing a few sizes & the case is alright(reason for 4 stars). quality is good for the price. i work on a lot of german cars & this set has fulfilled my needs so far
5,Stanley 97-126 11 piece 1/2 Drive Socket Set,I own an auto repair shop. I've used these everyday with my air gun with no problems over the last few months. I can't ask for more in a tool.
3,Back and forth,"Though this book has a lot of information, it is a tough book to actual use. The intros to each section have all of Trimbel's info. Then there are long lists of questions. The answers are a few pages later and you have to go back and forth to get the information. I found this book a difficult book to actually use, even to sit down and read. Back and forth. Back and forth. Good info. Hard to use. Thus, not enjoyable."
2,"Good acting, interesting plots, but poor dialog; infested w/ politics","The other reviewers who complained that the interjected political views nearly ruin the series are correct. It is just too heavy-handed to ignore. Of course, if you believe in the fairy tale that science is the be-all and end-all of what is real and what is not, then perhaps this is right up your alley. For the rest of us, we are left with interesting stories and good acting poisoned by the spiritless faith of science uber alles."
4,A Bulgarian appetizer,"This is the kind of music you want to play yourself as a pianist with a friend. Where is the sheet music? It's really appetizing. You want to hear more of this composer, modern with a sniff of Bulgarian folk music."
5,Can't Go Wrong,If you are a mystery buff like myself you can't go wrong with Midsomer Murders - I can never guess who the killer is no matter how many of these movies I watch. Great viewing!
3,Midsomer Murders Set 7 3.5 out of 5,The cast relationships were less developed and sometimes didn't work at all except for the Green Man episode which was the farewell for the Gavin character. The new set 8 is better as there is a DC who works well with Barneby and they are back on track. The plots were good as usual.
5,Really nice read.,I'm sometimes unsure when I get a free book or a book from an author I don't see on the regular book shelves. This book was very well written and pulled me into the story. I teach 4th grade and I used a watered down version of the story to explain how readers get hooked into good stories and how how a reader who is really hooked into a book doesn't need to look back at the book because they are so into a book they are aware of what is going on. Many of my 4th graders can't wait until they get older to read this book (or what they think it is about after I gave them the kid friendly version!).
5,Really Good Read!,You won't regret the time you spend immersed in this book. The characters were enjoyable and the town came to life in the pages. I found it on the free list but gladly would have paid for it. Read it~ you wont be sorry!
1,Last Bride of Ballymuir,"Ok, but can definitely put it down and forget that I was reading it. Was not a page turner. Fell asleep everytime I started reading it."
3,Good read!,This book was a joy to read. i am a romantic by heart and it made me cry in the end.I give this book a 4 star.
4,Last Bride in Ballymuir,Great tale set in Ireland. This tells the story of a man falsely accused and spent 14 years in prison and him rebuilding his life with a teacher used to being a floor mat to make up for her fathers mistakes. Captivating tale.
3,Good,I read this book and enjoyed the irish connection. my only fault was that there wasn't much about the final stage. Don't want to say what because will ruin end for readers. Worth reading.
3,Book T he last bride in B allymuir,This book is starting out ok..I have just started to read this book..I am pleased this book is on Kindle for free
2,Vibration worse the the old mount.,I installed this in a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruser. The rubber is too hard and feel vibration. I had to install OEM mounts.
1,Dead turtles are TURNOFFS. Terrible. Unreadable.,"I don't know how Kat Martin gets published. I start skimming through this book to find a scene. Kat Martin, let me inform you what any honest reader would have told you if you'd had them read this book:Having a guy kill a turtle is not sexy. I like turtles. Most of your readership probably would also wonder why someone would kill turtles. DEAD TURTLES are TURN-OFFS. Having said guy strip the girl of her ""windbreaker"" and see her ""orange tank top"" is not sexy. Said clothing combination is not hot. Not to anyone. I realize modern setting make bodice-ripping out of place but really?Even if you're paid by the word, and that in the world of romance novels, there's not always a high bar, there's no excuse for this."
2,Yawn...,"This book was so drowsy, I had to stop reading it half way through; it was a cliche romance novel with absolutely no suspense. (Well, it may have had a bit, but I couldn't stay awake to experience it.) All in all...this book should be rated ""Z"" for zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
4,Exciting,This book kept you turning the pages to find out what happens next. I read this book in 1 day.
3,Not really for mulchers.,"This blade seems to work OK and fit fine on my mower, replacing a 10 year old blade. However it was missing some of the twists and turns that the original blade had, and doesn't seem to mulch very well, so if your mower is a mulching mower you may want to consider a different blade. If you bag the grass or just use the side discharge, this blade works fine."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,"The sequel to Little Black Girl lost did not live up to the first. This story was about Napoleon going all out to get Johnnie Wise away from her boyfried Lucas. I felt sorry for Lucas and Johnnie. They were to kids left alone in a dangerous world of deceit. It was unbelievable to me that any women or should I say girl; would be worth all the time and effort that Napolean put in. The story was too long and dragged thoughout. If there was not a follow up novel, I would have stopped reading it halfway through. I have read Sugar and Spice, Pretenses and Little Black Girl Lost, there were excellent. This one was not up to the same high standards that you get from his work. Keith Lee Johnson has become one of my favorite authors. Even though this one was a disappointment I will continue to read each and every novel. On another not, if you are new to his novels, read Pretenses before Sugar and Spice, it will cut down on a lot of confusion."
4,I'm a Good Girl,"In the second story of Johnnie Wise, I wasn't as pleased as I was with the first. This one seemed to be a bit too repititive and didn't have much of a story line as the first. It was too long and not enough in between, however it wrapped up well and made for a decent read. If you want to find out what happens to Johnnie,Lucas,Napolean and Marla, you may want to pick this up."
2,A Bit on the Boring Side,"I'm an avid reader, so I know from the first few pages a person can tell if a book is good or not. I couldn't finish Black Girl Lost 2. The author's style of writing was very juvenile, and non descriptive. I felt like this book was for teenagers, there was a new chapter every other page (are you kidding me!).This book went from fast to slow and there was no real plot. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Some questions are answered,Keith Lee does it again! Johnnie has a way of pulling you in and wanting you to know more about her. I read this book in 1 day. It was a great and easy read. When I finished the book I had questions about the future of Johnnie and some other characters. I have heard that most questions will be answered in the 3rd and final installment. I can't wait to read it. Keith has a way of capturing your attention and holding it to the last page. He can write from a womens or mans perspective in a way that everyone understands and can relate to.
3,A C tt of course I am grading on a scale,"Little Black Girl Lost2 was much better than LBG lost. It wasn't very exciting but I was riding on a train for three days and it was something to do... I don't think I would recommend this book to my good friends..Maybe to associates or people I don't really like...Hey, I know what I could do with it, if I pick someone name out of the Christmas hat and don't really like the person, I'll just give them this book...TT4N"
1,Lost Time Reading This One....,I read LBGL and it left me wanting more. I got this one and read it. It read like a black and white tv western with one action scene. I'm going to stop this madness right here...when the next one comes out I won't be in that line to get it....
4,Good lid but I don't like the sticky bottom,The bowl is as described and is reasonably well made. The lid fits nicely and this is the only SS bowl that I have been able to find with a real lid. I wanted it for a salad bowl and it would be excellent for that purpose except that the sticky bottom makes it adhere to the table top. This isn't a criticism of the product in its recommended application.
4,"Great price, performs as it should",What can I say? This is a straight-forward product. It works as it should with my Vista Ultimate-powered laptop. Wish you the best of luck!
2,Doesn't cooperate fully w/Vista,"Despite the ""Windows Vista"" compatibility logos on the Startech website & other reviews here, this card would not install properly on my Fujitsu laptop running Vista Business.Oddly, I could still plug in and read/write to my external HDD, but other functionality was busted & it kept trying to find the card drivers. There are none available from the Startech website. Their tech support was quick to respond, but unable to solve the problem. Apparently the drivers should be included in Windows XP and Vista, but weren't on my system.There are cheaper alternatives w/both 1394a (Firewire 400) and the newer 1394b (Firewire 800) that hopefully will work out better. Returning this for another option."
2,Not LOA,"I got this on a search for the law of attraction. While it is an ok guided meditation of the eastern variety, it really has nothing to do with manifesting in relation to LOA. This guy is into chakras and tao te ching. I can only assume he was riding ""The Secret""s tailwind when this was produced."
1,Not worth the money,"I could not even start to meditate to this CD. A cd of ""Ah"" and ""OM"" is not helpful. This was not even re-recorded for the CD, it keep on referring to the ""tape""I have a ""scarecrow"" where I hang my old cd's to scare birds away from my garden. I think playing this cd will work better!"
3,Good Content - Needs Updating,Dr. Wayne Dyers content is helpful and inspiring. This audio needs balancing. The CD was obviously copied from an older cassette tape. The meditation techniques have worked well for me. Be prepared to adjust the volume during the meditation portions.
5,Aaaaah meditations-aaaaah!,I love this and use this daily and have had some remarkable coincidences occur while doing so. Great things are afoot in your life if you do this one!!!
2,Manifesting my twelve dollars back.,"I ordered this audiobook in hopes of getting practical information on how manifesting works and how it can work for me. Instead, I received a tape of a man making long winded noise. This was a huge disappointment for me as I bought this tape specifically because Wayne Dyer usally writes a decent book. Not this time."
3,Not the best mediation CD I've ever heard...,I guess it just wasn't what I expected. I didn't find it as soothing as I thought... Maybe I'm just not used to his style.
1,Don't waste your money,I am a newby to meditation. What I got from this CD could've been said in 1 sentence - chant 'AHhhhhhhhhhhhh' in the morning and 'Ohmmmmmmmm' at night. This is a huge waste of money. This is not a guided meditation. The author chants 'Ah' and 'Ohm' throughout. The voice is too loud and distracting.
4,"Works, was a gift","I got this item for my friend whose onboard network interface quit working. The item works fine, and he hasn't complained about it once."
2,Hoping I just got a bad one,"I have several SK tools. Their sockets are great. This thing is garbage, right out of the box. A very poor design requires tension to be set with a hex screw. Too tight and it won't move at all. Too loose and it reverses itself under load. I thought I had it but it didn't hold. I requested a repair kit from SK. If they deliver, and the kit fixes the problem, I'll delete or edit this review. Until then, avoid at all cost. Very bad design."
5,Ray Bradbury made me fall in love with Science Fiction,"I have searched and searched for this book for years and everywhere I looked people told me it was out of print. REJOICE, REJOICE!! I've finally found it!! A collection of stories that will take you on a magical journey through time, space, and all levels of psychological euphoria. Ray Bradbury is THE most brilliant science fiction writer of our time and this book reflects his ability to convey the very deepest emotion through what may seem at first glance like meerly words on a page. The best story in this book is ""The Man""."
4,Terrific but Not Timely Anymore,"This is a great collection of the early stories of Ray Bradbury. I say early because this collection was published in 1980 and Mr. Bradbury has thankfully been very productive in the last twenty-odd years.Still, as a compendium of his short work before 1980, you could do no better. Also included is an inspiring essay on the art of writing, ""Drunk and In Charge of a Bicycle."""
3,"Works, but loud ticking","This thing seems to work fine, but the ticking is loud. Used it for the heater in the heater/fan combo I installed. Now I am looking for something silent.Some notes:You must turn it to at least 3 minutes for it to work.It has white and almond dials and plates, you pick what color. The number plates go over a standard switch plate. This actually works well.The screws to attach it to the wall box are too cheap to even use. They seem like that are made of lead, strip out easily. Had to buy screws."
4,"Not every cut a winner, but enough winners to sell the CD","This is a real ""best of"" CD, which presents the most memorable cuts from Santana's earliest CD's. His brilliance shines now as ever...and long may it wave. The earlier cuts are more convincing than the later ones, and the lack of remastering is annoying, as surely work of this caliber deserves the better presentation. Die hard fans, or those wanting to explore Santana, will do well to give this CD a hard look (listen.)"
1,Useless,"A waste of money, don't work on most surfaces and are prone to come crashing down at the most inconvenient times."
1,"""boo"" a big thumbs way down","Mine broke after the fourth time i used it! The sound was too quiet also! When i tried to play with my buddies in my basement their sound blew mine away they told me to start playing and i was playing! They told me to get a new one or i was out of the group! And they ""were"" my best friends! I spent all the money i had on it! Please don't don't give these filth mongers the pleasure of getting your money and use it to buy a new toilet the money is better spent down the toilet than on that keyboard!"
3,It was cheaper two years ago...,"(...)I'm not sure if I was buying a new video card now that I would buy this one. It's fairly weak and wouldn't be very useful for anyone planning on doing any serious amount of gaming, however if you just need something to output a picture, this will sure do it. It is Windows XP compatible, so that's a plus."
2,Look elsewhere.,"I bought this book in the hopes of an analysis of form similar to Scott McCloud's works. This book was very dissappointing in that it offers some extremely basic information on lettering, was a very short book for its price and also it is SO busy trying to ""wow"" you with comic art, screentone, etc. that it often overpowers you. Other books, by comparison, are done in a comic format but manage to be far better designed than this one.I respect the lettering talents and the work of Comicraft, but the delivery kills the message!"
5,Best Wall Hanger for Guitar...Great Price,I have 5 of these that each hold a guitar and have had no problems with them marking the neck or failing on me.
4,"Drywall mounts are useless, hanger itself is GREAT","Just to confirm several other reviews - these hangers are really nice. They add a nice look to your room and they perform a much-needed function very well. As other have said, though, the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and I DON'T recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywall!Even my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall, so there's no way I'd trust any of my ""proper"" guitars to these things! I bought some heavy-duty anchors from the local DIY store (you can get them from Amazon tooTOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA Toggle Bolt with Bolts, USA Made, For 3/16""-24 Fastener Size (Pack of 10)) and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw. Much better! I have a few of these, holding up a Les Paul type, a Strat, a Godin and a G&L; tele and they've been holding up (pun intended!) fine for a few weeks now."
3,Overall good game. Has flaws. Be ready for blood.,"SoF is a bloody gory and occasionally disturbing FPS to even people who like movies such as fist of the north star. SoF is realistic which means its hard. Everyone i know is using the cheat codes. Slow systems havent a prayer on running this game. I would reccomend aiming higher than the system requirements. The game is overall fun but gets repetitive. No real puzzles except for turning on generators or shooting crates to reveal passageways. Arsenal is well chosen. Pretty fun but don't expect anything too challenging aside from people shooting at you. This game is for fans of testosterony action movies. One chief indicator is that at the end of EACH level, the main characters always seem to end up blowing something up in a huge explosion that they ""dramatically"" run away from."
2,Buggiest game I've ever played,"I have never had this bad an experience with any game. The thing crashes ALL the time and get this, you have to install it in a priviledged account, but have to play it in a non-priviledged account. Ouch! I also somehow got locked into parental discretion mode. Since I did not switch it to that I obviously did not have the password to change it back. When it works, it is fun. What isn't so fun is to spend 45 minutes getting through the game, and have it quit without warning.The one thing I suppose that does not help is that I am running it under Windows 2000, which in effect is NT5."
5,Get it.,"Love this lens. You can't go wrong with it. Quality is top notch, performance and focus is superb and fast. I use it with a D60."
4,Solid Performer,"I agree with the other reviews here. This is a great lens, especially for the money. While focus hunts a bit in low light, the lens otherwise performs very well. The VR, in particular is amazing. I have a lens with the previous iteration of VR and the new VR is much better in actual use. I regularly use it hand held at the 200-300 range and have been very pleased with the results. Can't go wrong with this lens."
4,In good light this lens shines.,This is a great lens and worth the dollars if you are going to be using it in good light. In low light its hard to get a good shot without using the flash. I'm still a beginner but have gotten some excellent shots with it. It isn't the fastest lens around but if you know what you are doing you can achieve some really nice snaps.Many people love this lens and I can see why.
3,Excellent quality but heavy and not easy to use,"Excellent for hobby if you really need that extra range. But eventually, may not get out of the box too often.I found it useful for children portrait with excellent results (with a Nikon D90), even at 300mm.It complements a 18-105mm, and if I'd have to choose again, i'll probably replace the 2 by a 18-200.The rate is more about the usage, quality is excellent"
2,lens miscarriage a week of use,"lens miscarriage a week of use, broke inside parts of the focus ring, and I had to repair mandarlorlos in my country Uruguay to the Uruguay nikkon technical service, which charged me $ 340 to fix it, since no I have international warranty from the lens, I got a faulty lens and as you know I'm not a U.S. resident Diero this lens I messed up, because they know that it is very expensive to send me back to the U.S. for me change, so the complaint is granted, I hope it does not happen to another foreign buyer, is the only time I have a complaint on amazon, because I always buy all my stuff and I've never had any problems in my other items purchased, take note"
5,Awesome Lens for the price! Get one...,"This lens is excellent. I purchased mine here on Amazon to shoot a GrandAm Daytona Prototype race where I was granted media access to all sections of the track and pits. WOW. This lens is FAST focusing and SHARP. The only drawback is that I was not used to the length and I kept smacking the lens hood into the Armco barrier.I shoot with both a D700, and a D300. Since the D300 has the 1.5x crop factor, making this lens a 105-450mm I used it, handheld to shoot 5,011 images in three days. I also used the D700 with a 28-200 mostly on the wide end for pit action such as tire changes, etc.All I can say I can't be happier with my purchase!"
4,Outstanding value,"I've found the optical performance of this VR lens to be flawless. It is easy to manipulate, especially with the focus ring being close to the camera body (instead of the other end of the lens). My only suggested improvement would be to have a tripod mount on the lens itself. The package becomes rather unbalanced when your only choice is to use the camera's tripod mount."
4,Nikon lense.,Good product. A little too much money. Hope to get much use out of it. Just in time close up pictures of animals in the area.
4,Works great!,Nature and landscape photos are greatly enhanced and easier to capture with this lens. Only wish is that it had a little more magnification.
3,Cheap but you know.,You get what you pay for. The flag looks good but not recommended for pole hanging out side. It looks weak in color one side. Cool for wall mural.
3,Not the best quality but...,"what more could I expect for the price I paid?!?! For less than $5 total ($4.48 + free shipping), I got what I paid for. Don't get me wrong, I am not dissatisfied with the flag, it's just cheap - like the price. So if you're looking for a quality-made, durable flag to fly outside in the elements, you should keep looking. But if you are like us and just want a standard sized, Texas flag to respresent our Country's GREATEST state in your man-cave or garage bar, look no futher and save your money for beer!"
5,Just like at the concert,This double album set was amazing. The sound quality was great but it still felt as if you were rockin along right with them live at the concert! Awesome music at real good price.
4,customer service,"i bought my creative zen in april and in august it stopped working. as i live in brasil the process of returning it for the warranty was somewhat risky via postal service and too expensive via Fed Ex or UPS.i did in fact send it via regualar mail service and it arrived safely. the customer service folks were very good and sent me a new machine. however due to a communication glitch, it was sent via regular mail to brasil and brasilian customs asked a US$120 to release it to me.custom service assumed responsibility and shipped me another machine to a US address. so i want to acknowledge that they gave their word and kept it. job well done and greatly appreciated. these are trustworthy folks!"
4,Creative ZEN W,I found the player to have excellent picture quality. It is easy to navigate around and my only regret was not getting 60GB version. Being able to plug in the TV is a bonus. I would definately recommend this to my family and friends.
1,A disappointment at Best,"This adventure seems hastily written and hastily put together. It lacks a real adventure hook and is basically a collection of encounters. And it's boring. I would have given it two stars for the interesting race of bat creatures within, but one of their special attacks lacks a DC, so even that isn't done correctly. Another annoying thing about the module is that it contains magical solutions for current technology, such as SCUBA gear. Super lame. This is a lackluster effort and a real disappointment from Skip Williams."
5,"I really love this product, although....","They're great, and actually a lot larger then I thought they would be. Good quality, sturdy, but unfortunately I think I gain more happiness out of them then my guinea pigs do. I've caught one of them in it probably three times in the past four months but otherwise it's not been used, so I took them out (I bought two). 5 stars because they came quickly, they're sturdy, and HUGE for Guinea Pigs.. Which is nice. :}"
2,not that great,the hammock was thin and not as cozy as other hammocks that i have purchased for my chinchillas. also the clips were plastic and not metal which makes it easier for my pets to chew.
3,A handy pocket-book for SHO's/junior residents starting out.,"This is a welcome addition to the Oxford Handbook series, which is so popular with medical students and trainee doctors throughout the English speaking world. As an overview or introduction to Accident & Emergency Medicine it is comprehensive in the topic areas it covers. It does not dwell on theoretical detail, but acts as a practical guide for students and junior doctors unsure of the initial assessment and management of common emergency problems. A criticism I would offer is that this book is lacking somewhat in detail in terms of the management of many conditions, offering the advice ""refer to specialist"" all to frequently. In a climate where emergency physicians are expanding their role, this may limit the use of this book in the near future. Overall, for the medical student or first time doctor in A&E, this is a very useful resource to have readily available."
3,"helpful, but...",This item is helpful but it's a little stiff when trying to fit around you for bf. Baby likes to be propped on it though.
5,A Must Have!!!,"This pillow is definitely a must have for any new baby. I have used it for my 2 month old almost daily. It's great for nursing, tummy play and propping her up so she can see the world. It's the perfect thing for her to sit by me while I fold clothes on the bed. I have also used it for my 7 month old niece to sit-up in before she could sit unassisted. She loved it too. I have washed the cover several times without problem. We also use it as a ""chair"" under her play gyms."
2,Not the best for breastfeeding!,I recieved this as a shower gift and I wish I would have took it back. I hated it for nursing and ended up buying the My Brest Friend pillow which gives much more support. It may come in handy later when my baby is older when she is on her tummy or sitting up.
4,Wheels are not smooth.,Product is good except for the fact that the wheels do not roll smoothly. We have a home that is completely tiled with no carpet and yet my husband finds it a little difficult to wheel around the house. I should have paid attention to the previous reviews but I was very hopeful. Overall it is a great product for the price.
3,extrem heavy,"not for a disabled person, not for a disabled person, not for a disabled personnot for a disabled person,not for a disabled person"
4,Dissappointing - well maybe not,"This lighter worked great for a while then began losing its spark. It is pretty easy to blow out (no wind resistance at all - which I expected) but then having it be difficult to relight is a pain. Seems like there is no more spark.After writing this original review, I took the lighter out and tinkered with it a bit. It seems that the small igniter (the wire that shots the spark onto the burner) got pushed down into the lighter somehow [not sure how, I pretty much always leave the little cap on] - anyway that was the cause of the misfires. After nudging it back up above the burner, I get a light almost every time. Leaving the setting a 4 though - cause I cannot figure out how this may have happened to cause the misfires in the first place."
1,Don't buy this lighter,"this lighter is impossible to fill, the piece at the bottom is very hard to turn and finding the right tool to turn it is very hard. I can't believe i wasted 30something dollars on a piece of crap. Do not buy this lighter!!!"
5,The best cigar lighter I've ever used,"I've had a lot of cigar lighters over the years, but the only one I've had last is my blazer pocket torch. I finally had to replace it when I lost my last one after 10 years. It's not as attractive as the fancier brands, but it works more consistently and reliably."
4,Warning--not submersible!,"Not that you'd expect it to be. Just to let you know. Mine died after a brief immersion -- the piezoelectric sparker wouldn't function. Until then, it worked fine, though it was getting harder and harder to get it to light. Sometimes 8-10 clicks would be required. Never did figure out why. Oh, well -- time to get another. The clear one's cheaper."
1,PB207 Blazer Lighter,"Like so many others who have left reviews for this lighter I ordered multiple PB207 lighters and instead got the model PB207-CR which is the child resistant (CR). At 60 years old, the dexterity of my fingers have trouble with the CR ""locks"" so I did not want this model. I called to make the order to avoid this and specifically asked Amazon to NOT send the Child Resistant (CR)lighters and they assured me they would not. They did anyway. Evidently even when you speak to an Amazon representative at the time of order they don't care enough to make sure you are getting what you ask for."
4,My favorite lighter,"I owned the non-childproof Blazer before this model and it was a workhorse for over 5 years. I used it for everything from cigar night to lighting birthday candles at lightening speed. Unfortunately it died when I put some old (bad) butane in and could never get it to stay lit again. The new lighter is working as well as the old one, great to have it back. The only con I would give is I wish they would put out a non-childproof model again. It's slightly annoying and my kids are grown. If there is one available I couldn't find it. It's been a great product for me."
5,BOBBY DIGI IS THE BIZZOMB.BEST WU ALBUM SINCE CUBAN LINX,"I just picked up the album, and from the first track to the last I was definetely impressed. RZA truly shows off his musical and lyrical talents. IF YOU'RE A WU-FAN---YOU GOT TO CHECK THIS ONE OUT."
2,"you may buy it,","But it doesn't keep up with the other wu releases, i mean it's RZA come on, Why he did this shiat, please, have some respect for the wu family and soldiers, i would say that this s shaiter tha supreme clientele"
2,Just for money?,Rza been coming tight with the beats so I expected every cut to be on hit. It seems this project was for a few dollas cause I know he can come tighter then that. There was a few tight licks like holocaust and unspoken word but what the hell is B.O.B.B.Y. about that was buty.
3,Not a favorite,"I have listened to this cd over 100 times, and this album just did not meet my expectations. RZA is an incredible emcee, but to me in my opinion, this cd does not rank up with the other Wu artists.A few of the tracks were however pretty tight, but for the most part the cd was just wack to me."
1,RZA should stick to producing,RZA is not a rapper and unfortunately he reminds us about that throughout this album...
2,RZA is not Kool Keith,"This is the WORST of the Wu.RZA here is trying to play Kool Keith (i.e. the a.k.a., the mask, the cape). Him ripping off Kool Keith (even if it is better priduced) is no where near as fun as listening to Sex Style for the first time oneself, and doesn't even come close to touching Dooom or Octagon.So what is redeeming in this album? Hmm. Some of the lyrics are clever. 'Girl you look as pretty as a brand new glock/or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox' is about the best line that I have ever heard. There are a couple tracks that expand upon the Wu-formula to great success. BUT, please, if you want an underground album where they are going to play aliases, etc. buy Kool Keith, and if you want a well produced album, buy Peanut Butter Wolf or something.I'm going to get ripped for writing a bad review of this album. Sorry."
1,What a load of tat,"Sorry RZA, I have a lot of respect for you and what you've done, but I've never heard such a confused artificial sounding mess of an album. The rapping is non-existent meaningless and the production is rushed. If you are thinking of buying this album then don't you are wasting your money. In fact if you want it I'll give it to you. Bobby you should take some advise from ghostface, stay true, stay true."
3,"aight for a first cd solo, but definately a different rza",a few tight tracks but some of the lyrics and beats are kinda wack. uses the theme bobby digital too much.
2,Just for money?,"Rza been coming tight with the beats so I expected every cut to be on hit. It seems this project was for a few dollas cause I know he can come tighter then that. There was a few tight licks like holocaust,Kiss of ablack widow,and unspoken word but what the hell is B.O.B.B.Y. about that was buty."
3,cute but not as expected,"These bowls are cute but that is it. The spices or what ever non-liquid you put in them clings (static)to bowl,so you don't get accurate measurements.These bowls are also easy to knock over. They work ok for use as dipping mini bowls."
5,I use these all the time,They are handy when cooking multiple items at once. You can prep your spices without taking up too much counter space.
4,Very Handy,These little bowls are very handy and easy to clean. I've had my set for well over a year and have washed them over and over in the dishwasher. Haven't noticed any discoloration nor loss of flexibility after repeated use.
5,Fun for all kinds of uses!,"I use these little pinch bowls for all kinds of things, great for dipping sauces or having spices right at hand while doing lots of cooking. I even use one to mix my primer and my Bare Escentuals foundation for flawless application, or to custom mix just the right shade. Great inexpensive purchase!"
1,The worst game I have ever played...,"My family and I always play games at the Holidays and, this year, this was my contribution. What a mistake. This game is terrible. The sounds are so exaggerated they sound completely unreal, e.g. ""buttering bread"" - sounded more like someone applying sandpaper to a car. If I buttered my bread the way they made it sound, I'd be left with a big gaping hole in my slice of bread!"
3,"Not sturdy, wobbly, temporary solution","I ordered this in a small, and then medium sizes. The quality is less than desirable because the item does not sit flat and wobbles too much when the pet moves around. I guess the only way to avoid this is to stake it to the ground. I bought it because it looked like a little cozy home vs the typically crate or cage. May work well for a small animal but I cannot see it working well for a larger dog. Hard to roll-up door and windows. The pad is thin and hard - you probably need to add another pad if you want to provide more cushion or warmth in the winter. Not sturdy enough to transport or pick up a pet."
2,Much smaller than it appears to be,"This was dissapointing. The carrier is Much Much smaller than it appears to be in the ad. I was unhappy with this aspect of the purchase. Aside from that, the carrier is high quality."
4,OK first ADO 2.0 book,Worked fine for me provided a lot of useful information about ADO.NET 2.0. I had no problems installing the database files.
3,Good soundtrack,"When you listen this soundtrack it makes you relax and feel confortable. You enjoy it for a while but then, it becomes bore.In the end, is worth it."
2,great idea,The cap is a great idea but it does not seal so it does not keep the fuzz over time. Too bad.
4,What great ideas for how not to ruin your kid!,The book was well written with great ideas and examples of how to deal with money and kids/young adults at any age. The concept of having the child manage their own trust well in advance of them receiving it was fabulous. It also helped explain why kids of affluent parents often meander unhappily through life and how to make sure that doesn't happen to your kids.
2,Not the same scent.,"Save your money, this is not the original scent. Just got it, smelled it and for a second I detected traces of the orginal then it drifted away to something else. Not unpleasant, just was not what I wanted. Well you,win some and you lose some. At least the delivery was on time."
1,"Great songs, but just more repackaging","These are great songs known and loved by all longtime Chris LeDoux fans (and I've been a fan for about 25 years), but surely Capitol could have come up with a better tribute than yet another repackaging of old Chris songs (true, there's one new song). After all the years Chris recorded, surely there are at least 10 unreleased songs somewhere. Capitol could have used the new song on this CD and the two previously unreleased songs on the first box set and then found seven more. Maybe Capitol could even have persuaded Garth Brooks to include his tribute song to Chris.Since 1994, Capitol has released NINE compilations of Chris' previously released material (two box sets, live, best of, greatest hits, re-recordings, and two other collections). How many different ways can Capitol re-release Chris songs and rip off his fans?""Anthology"" is a poor tribute to my favorite singer of all time."
2,"Inaccurate ""Look Inside"" info","The book I got is very nice, and fits the title description of the item. (Big Book of Christmas Songs Violin). HOWEVER, the ""Look Inside"" image shows music for piano, guitar and violin, whereas the book I have just contains the violin part. Even worse, the one song that is shown with the piano part included shows a different key signature than the same song in the book I recieved, so I can't simply purchase the other edition and use the books in tandem. I purchased the book so that I could play piano/violin duets with my daughter, what I ended up with was a book she can only use solo. If I had known, I would have purchased a different book, or a different edition. Not impressed that Amazon sells what is essentially two different books as one item in two editions."
4,Still the king,"Even without hitting the high notes,Elton proves he can deliver his old hits with sheer passion and style.This Cd captures a 1999 show that features Kiki Dee and Bryan Adams among others.Classics such as DON""T GO BREAKIN' MY HEART and SAD SONGS sound reenergized and anew.The duet with Mary J.Blige gives a new soulful flavor to I GUESS THAT's WHY THEY CALL IT THE BLUES."
4,"Good, but Elton John ""Solo"" was Incredible","Last month I was lucky enough to see Elton John live at the Residenz in Wuerzburg, Germany on the ""Solo"" tour. I was skeptic at first when I walked in and just saw the piano, but I soon learned that is Elton at his best. Elton John can still tear a piano up, and sing everything except for the high notes from some of his earlier albums. Which brings me to this album...The songs that Elton sang himself were incredible, however, the duets are painful to listen to. Bryan Adams sounds tone-deaf, and Mary J. Blige absolutely ruins ""I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues."" While Elton's voice has matured over the years, Kiki Dee's hasn't. I skip every duet song on the album. What I'm trying to say is, I hope that Elton records an album from the ""Solo"" tour. The concert was 2 1/2 hours of great music!!!"
2,Should have waited for a studio,"To establish my sentiments, I like Elton John's music and like him as a person. He is one of the few truly gifted and enduring talents.This CD: Basically it would appear to me that Elton needed to fullfill his record contract and/or generate some income; he should slow down his spending and skip efforts like this CD. There are better albums that cover these songs and the live venue for this recording does not show-case his voice. Bryan Adams and Ronan Keating (duets with Elton) sound as if they need a rest or were just not warmed-up.Skip this CD and wait for his studio album he has being working on with Bernie."
4,review,"The book takes place in Ancient Greece where Nic is fleeing from the plague in Athens and encounters danger. The pankration is an olympic event where people fight without weapons. This is one great book, but it was missing a little information about the charecters and about what happened after the pankration."
4,Wish it was cut into 4 tracks istead of 3.,"The rockabilly re-dos are stellar. I vastly prefer this version of ""Sing Your Life"" to the album track. Just wish they had put an additional track split after it and before the fawning fan tributes so I could load it onto my iPod."
2,Too dry and hard to use,"This was the first hamburger bun we found after our celiac diagnosis. Comes unsliced, was very hard to cut through. They were very dry and too bready. To be able to eat them at all, we had to wrap them in wet towels and heat/microwave...and eat FAST as they harden up quickly. No way you can toast them or grill them and have them not come out hard as a rock! Not much flavor either. The size is better than the tastier Schar brand we've found since though, actually is the right size for a regular burger patty."
5,Thank You Ener-G Foods!,"We love these buns. They should be toasted for the best taste but they are by far the BEST G/F, C/F, Soy Free, Egg Free bun we have tried (and we have tried alot!)I purchase them by the case thru Amazon. Free shipping and because of the way they are vaccuum packed, they have in incredibly long shelf life (6 months to a year!!! SERIOUSLY !!!)It is wonderful to be able to enjoy bread again!!!"
1,Melted in microwave,I sent this back. It melted in the microwave I left it in there cuz in order to get kids to use something it must either be attached to them or in the place it is to be used. Well it was in the microwave and we placed something atop of it and it melted
1,NOT APPROPRIATE for MICROWAVE USE!,Bought this Norpro set of Micro-Covers with high hopes based on the description and reviews. Followed the directions carefully to avoid problems. First use was in heating microwavable oatmeal. What a disaster! The Micro-Cover was way too light and exploded off the amply sized microwave dish. There was oatmeal splattered all over the inside of the microwave.Second use was on heating some water in a cup using the small Micro-Cover just like it is pictured on the package. No good! The Micro-Cover curled up from the heat and was therefore useless.I certainly would not recommend this product. The Micro-Covers are way too light for their purpose and explode off or curl up from the microwave heat. I gave it one star cause that's the minimum allowed.
4,A great writer,"Lee May is an excellent southern author. This is the story of reuniting with his estranged father and their mutual interest in gardening, but also is an account of the social changes during one man's life."
5,Disney's The Emperor's New Groove,This is a great soundtrck it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,LOVED this song!,"""Chorus"" is one of my very favorite erasure tracks to date. The album itself was a corucopia of bleeps, blips and fabuluos melodies that emalgomated into one unforgettable CD. In this album, Vince went back to his roots with the Moogs, ARPs and other synths to craft one of the best, if not THE best, Erasure album in history. Now as for this single.......well, Youth could have done a better job with the remixes...the ""Agressive Trance Mix"" was pretty nice...and outdid the other 2. The B-side ""Over the Rainbow"" is a boppy little ditty and always makes you feel you good...check out the ABBA reference in the track. not many people know that. Want a fantastic ""Chorus"" remix? Look for the ""Single Low End Mix"", with a fabulous new bass line....check it out...or email me, i can send it to you! :) CIAO BELLA!"
5,A must have for fans!,"I got into Belle and Sebastain about six or seven years ago, and this is great. Better than a DVD! As I was reading each story, the songs would play in my head, I was smiling the whole time.If you love Belle don't let this pass you by."
3,Beatles CD Sets Vol 1 & Vol 2,After spending over $100.00 on CDs I would expect the CDs would have the properlabels on them. The labels and the CDs are mixed up.
3,Box set flawed by the awful stereo mixes of Rubber Soul,"Although the overall sound quality upgrade is excellent, the horrible split stereo where the vocals are in the right channel & the instruments are in the left remain on most of Rubber Soul, except for tracks 1, 4 & 7, which are good. If Help & Beatles VI have proper stereo imaging, why doesn't Rubber Soul which is a later recording. The only place right now with balanced imaging is on the vinyl British Parlophone Rubber Soul. Too bad these weren't incorporated to any of the Rubber Soul cds."
5,Maybe wait a little longer...,"My May 8 2006 order from Amazon still contained the incorrect mixes. So if you're waiting to order this so you don't have to bother with calling the (800) to exchange them, you might want to wait a little longer."
1,Capitol can't do anything right!,"My copy has ""production errors,"" the original mono mixes were not used for Beatles VI and Rubber Soul. I've read that my chances were 50/50 if I would get a ""corrected"" version. Well, I got myself a flawed one.Perhaps, I'll try again through Amazon, but, only if they can guarantee me, they sell ""corrected"" copies only.PS: Hopefully Volume 3 (Yesterday & Today, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper & Magical Mystery Tour) won't be screwed up too."
1,When the **** is this going to be released in a version without errors?,"I am certainly NOT going to spend for a BOX-SET, only to send in TWO or THREE CDs to AGAIN wait for the ""correct"" ones; by now, I am not even certain that those ones will really be the ones the packaging promises."
3,ticket to spend,ticket to ride sounds terrible on this error set ...hope it sounds better on the corrected one
2,Boring,"I have read every one of Christine Feehans books and by far this was the most boring. It took me days to read, its one I could put down and take my time getting back to the story. By far not her best book. I found Destiny to be monotonus, and Nicolae a weak carpathian."
3,Dark but falling flat,"As more time goes on, I find it harder and harder to get into this series of her books.Feehan is forgetting about what makes her books great, and that is both the internal and external struggles each couple must fight in order to become the lifemates they need to be. This book totally focused on the internal problems of the heroine, while it could have been great, it really wasn't. It was long and drawn out and the plot took a backburner to the relationship which too could have been great, but fell short.The basis for this story line was such an intense emotional connection between a small child and an ancient carpathian, which did make for a strong bond, however, it wasn't explored to the fullest extent. The characters never really became real for me, they stayed in 1 dimension instead of becoming 3D.The plot was exaggerated and boring. I need less conversation and more action.I hope Feehan realizes this soon, otherwise her Dark series will stay in the dark for me."
1,Just like the others . . .,"and that's the problem. I've probably read all of the Carpathian books, but I'm now finished with the series. So many of the characters are the same, especially the men. For the women, different things may happen to them, but I feel like I'm reading about the same people over and over. I was really looking forward to this book recapturing what I liked about the first few in the series, but it didn't. If you haven't read any of Feehan's other novels then you'll probably enjoy this one, but otherwise just avoid it."
4,Another good read...,"Some reviewers complain that ""its the same old thing"" but Feehan imparts enough info on Carpathians so that each book can be read alone or as part of a series.I enjoyed reading this book, as I have all of her others. I give few books 5 stars but this one definitely ranks a 4 or above. I eagerly await each Feehan novel - she didn't let me down with this one."
2,"A good read, but not a good romance","This is the second of the ""Dark"" series of novels that I've read. I found it to be terribly... well... dark, and couldn't imagine Destiny ever having a normal relationship after what she experienced in childhood. Not without years and years of therapy anyway.That clouded the whole experience of reading the novel for me. I did think it was well written and some of the secondary characters were fun and had nice storylines. I just couldn't believe the romance aspect of it. It would have been better if I was expected a paranormal mystery novel rather than a romance one."
4,Another Dark Story,"It is a good book. It follows the series well, the plot stays with the ones that come before it.The sex scenes are too drawn out, the story line is good though. I have become accustom to skipping the 3-4 page long sex and then starting to read again.I'll continure to buy the dark series, just because I like the stories."
2,"self-flagellating, preachy trash","Ok so maybe starting the series on book 11 is not a good idea, BUT this trash was so not worth the time to read. The main female character goes on and on and on and on and you just wish she would shut up. The main male character ends up coming off the patron saint of patience, soooo not based in reality. Then of course throughout the book we have the homilies of the holier than thou population. There is a kernel of an interesting plot within and I had hopes for the book for the first 150 or so pages, BUT of course it did not live up to it and by page 300 I couldn't care less if the main characters lived. However, I will not get a book and NOT read it (was bought in a collection of supernatural romance lot). The book should have been 100 pages shorter. The only way I finished it was to put it in the bathroom where I was forced to finish it."
3,Repetitions abound,"I would recommend this book to Feehan fans, and the story line was interesting enough, and yet I found the book to be overly filled with repeated passages. The same thoughts and fears were retold over and over, every few pages, as though either the author might have been shooting for a certain word count, or she thought her readers might suffer from temporary amnesia after reading a few pages at a time.Annoyed by this, I ended up skipping over quite a few passages, and concentrated instead on enjoying the dark atmosphere Feehan is obviously so good at giving us. After all, Feehan is a master of ""atmosphere."""
3,A confused reader,"I've had the chance to read the majority of books in the ""Dark"" series. Unfortunately, as the series continues, it feels as if Feehan has run out of new ways to retell what is essentially the same story.I was hoping as I picked up ""Dark Destiny"", that perhaps the author had found a way: female Carpathian who survived abuse to become a female hunter. Hmmm the premise sounded intriguing, the execution of the storyline was not so good. It seems that the storyline is building up to something bigger (ie: Gregori taking slide samples to see if they could conquer vampirism etc) but at this point I'm ready to throw in the towel. Sure there are many steamy scenes that this series is known for, but throwing out a new name to an ancient isn't the way to attract or retain readers. Throw in a new twist, convert a vampire something anything, just don't leave us hanging."
1,Does not look at all like what is advertised.,"Bought these solely based on what the picture looked like and once I received them I noticed that they look nothing like what is advertised on amazon or on the front of the packaging for that matter. They look extremely cheap and there isn't a silver buckle on them at all, it's just printed on the front. They tips of them do not curl up like in the photo. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING BETTER. You WILL be disappointed."
1,NOT GOOD!,PRODUCT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT DID ON LINE. TOES DO NOT CURL UP AND THERE IS NO STRAP GOING THROUGH BUCKLE. WE RECEIVED JUST A PIECE OF BLACK VINYL WITH A PICTURE OF A BUCKLE ON IT!
2,Ramones DVD,"While I was satisfied with my overall experience of ordering online, I received a DVD that I cannot watch in the U.S. The viewing country/region code was not explained or addressed in my ordering. Since I have not ordered any DVD's before, I did not know that this was even an option. So, while I received a perfectly good copy of a DVD that can be viewed by SOMEONE SOMEWHERE, I cannot view it. Not happy about that, but I guess I just learned a lesson."
5,The Greatest Live Album EVER!,"Crowd noise.Loud rush of feedback.Dee Dee just can't wait, stays something like ""Einz!"".Joey tries to be a nice boy and introduces the crowd with a good ol' ""Hey! We're the Ramones and this one's called Rockaway Beach.""Dee Dee yells out ""OneTwoThreeFour"" and they're off! This is it, you know. The ULTIMATE live album. The one album more than anyone else that makes you wish you were there. The songs are just so FAST and FUN. ""Gabba Gabba Hey! We accept you!"". The Ramones sound like they're having the times of their lives. They're SO EXCITED! Just check out the photos on the inner sleeve! The instant a song's over Dee Dee just screams out another ""ONETWOTHREEFOUR!"" and they do another one just as fast and funny as the last one! Amazing. Doesn't punk rock? Tee hee. My Ya-Yas are gonna stay RIGHT where they are thank you very much. Those Ramones though, they kicked so much heineeken man. This albums rocks! Buy it today!"
2,R.I.P. Ramones,"I bought this out of curiosity how they sounded on live dvd but man skip button is very useful on this one.The sound quality is poor, just stick to the cd box sets and forget about their dvd releases for now."
3,Season 4 was not good!!,"There were a few things in Season 4 that just made no sense at all. How did Cordy just up and become evil one day? The transition from good Cordy to bad Cordy was poorly done. In addition, the fact that she and Connor slept together was just plain WRONG!! To be perfectly honest I really did not like this season at all. The season had its moments, but I just think the writers could have done a better job. However, the transition of Wesley from nerd to hunk was done nicely."
4,"Great, wel written stories","I have purchased several of the Katie books for my 4-year old granddaughter and she loves them, asking me to read them to her over and over again. They are charming stories with delightful illustrations as well as some interesting background information on various elements in the stories.VP, Brussels"
4,JUST BUY IT,"Smooth funky mello soul... Sounds like D'Angelo with the vocal overdubs and the beats, tho he comes across as a bit more accesible, a bit more vulnerable. If D'Angelo is the thug, Musiq is the sensitive homeboy from around the way. Theres influences of Stevie... Good stuff...His vocals are so melancholy at times... Theres a tender aching there that makes you wanna cry for him. The voice conveys a love so deep, almost childlike...If you liked his hit single Just Friends, you shouldnt be disappointed, just buy the damn CD."
4,just lovin'musiq,Aijuswanaseing is an old school flavor for the new school generation. Musiq represents Philly at it's best..
5,THE MAN!,"Right now this is my favorite and most played cd. When I first heard it at a friends house I freaked out because every song was tight. It's not often you hear a cd and like every song the first time you hear it. My favorite track is ""You and Me"". I like that the most because I can vibe the lyrics, harmony, beat, and definitely the creativity of the song. I hope Musiq Soulchild goes far in his career. I also wish that people woulnd't compare him to other artists because everyone who does anything in this world has to learn, or get ideas from somewhere to enhace their own creativity. Keep doing your thing dawg!"
4,Inexpensive book...so worth it...,"It's an old book...keeping that in mind, there's not a whole lot of pinochle strategy, and the rule descriptions are very old and outdated. But it's still worth it for a short enjoyable read, I think. Most of the strategy was regarding two-handed pinochle, and mostly about how to build hand for the end game. I don't think you'll learn much, but it was still a fun read for me."
3,Sleeping at the Barn,"Doesn't quite live up to it's name. Three good songs, but the rest are too mellow,and everyone knows if they don't rock then you wear out your ship button."
3,A bit dull,"I really enjoy creative jazz piano work but this album disappointed me. Perhaps the heavily discounted price should have tipped me off. The Michael Franks vocal on ""Christmas Time is Here"" was a nice surprise though. Otherwise, it's mostly a reprise of the ""Peanuts"" stuff."
3,Nice Barn,Cute barn and the animals are nice quality but the barn doesn't have a latch or anything to keep it closed which can be annoying and it needs something else like hay or something but its cute.
4,Great Barn- Not so Great Animals!,We love love love this barn! My two daughters play with it every day and it has held up great. The wood is smooth and well painted and we have had no problems with wear and tear issues. That said... the animals are cheap and not so friendly looking! They remind me of the cheapo plastic animals you buy from the dollar store! Not the high quality we are used to from Melissa and Doug products. So.. buy the barn and toss the silly animals! We replaced ours with nicer rubber animals.
4,Dries you in 30 seconds,"I love it, because i'm always on the run, and this thing dries you super fast!It also dries quickly in itself, and is good for small bathrooms with no windows."
5,Excellent Towels!,I purchased these for my mother who has Parkinson's Disease. She finds it a real struggle to dry off after taking a shower. She absolutely loves these towels!! She says she just puts them on her skin and they dry her off very quickly. There is no need for a back and forth drying off motion. I highly recommend them!!
2,"Bought based on reviews, DISSAPOINTED","The reviews are great, so my wonderful fiance bought me (us) this towel. I suppose it is absorbent and a good size, but it STICKS to our skin. It makes it very difficult to dry off. I don't use it anymore - she occasionally uses it for her hair. Not recommended for a comfortable bath towel."
4,Extremely absorbent; gets you dry -- BUT,"I like this towel because it dries me off quickly and more completely than any towel that I have ever used. It absorbs up moisture from my skin much like a chamois does when used after washing a car. HOWEVER, if you are looking for that thick & soft plushy feel of a luxury resort cotton towel don't buy this one. The microfibers are so effective that the towel clings to my body and requires some effort to move without bunching up. I also like how fast this towel dries after use, as well as after machine washing, and does not become smelly after two or three showers. Overall this is a good towel but not a very good value; probably more expensive than most people are willing to pay."
5,Good single,I like this single. Especially the remixes on it and La La La is beautiful with lots of mistique. It's too bad you don't hear more music like it played on the radio.
3,A little disappointed,"My (...) daughter received this kitchen for Christmas. It was really easy to put together, however the refrigerator door won't stay closed and the dishwasher, oven and microwave are hard for an adult to open and almost impossible for a toddler(...). The quality of Little Tikes isn't what it used to be."
5,In stores??,Does anyone know if i can buy this in stores or is it only available on-line? At Target and Walmart you can only buy it on-line but it doesn't say about Toys r us. I want to get it as a x-mas gift but id rather buy in a store in case it is missing any peices. Please someone let me know soon!
4,Great First Kitchen,"We bought this kitchen for my 15 month old daughter. She loves washing the dishes (although for some reason, once we turn the water on, it stays on until you hit another knob for a different sound). It's very durable. The only other downfall is that you have to keep track of the food because they are the only ones that the kitchen can recognize. Overall, a great buy. [...]"
4,Don't kiss it goodbye,"I have to say I think it's the best since the second book, A Caress of Twilight. While I always enjoy Hamilton's walks on the wild side, this book had more plot than the last two novels in this series. Mistral's Kiss started off being quite similar to the last two but about two-thirds of the way through I realized this book was going somewhere other than the nonstop sex. It's about time Merry realizes who she loves - geez! I also liked having Sholto reintroduced. I'm not too wild about Mistral though - I'm just not into *that* much pain. As a journalist I spotted several typos and hope they were caught before the book was released. Is it just me, or are her books getting shorter? Micah (Anita Blake) was, of course, a novella, but this struck me as shorter too. I read my advance reader's copy of Mistral's Kiss in one night."
1,Bleh,"A scandalous waste of money. One-dimensional characters with about as much depth as a half-dried mud-puddle. No discernible plot. I'd rather I'd saved my money toward the cost of my own cremation when I die, lo these many years hence."
3,Too Short,"This book is about 200 pages shorter than I expected. However, the price was pretty much the same. Starting to feel a little short changed. Perhaps Ms. Hamilton's creative juices are starting to run a little dry...or maybe she is just getting lazy. I don't like being disappointed by one of my favorite authors. By the way, the binding on my copy of this book was terrible."
5,Loved it!,"I agree that this book was shorter than her last books but it was not short on plot or character development and it didn't feel short. Don't judge this book on the number of pages. If you do you will miss out on a great read! Oh and for those of you who hate this writers style or use of erotica, stop buying her books. Wouldn't your money be better spent on a book you'll actually enjoy?"
2,First time for any of her books,"I checked this(audio book) out of the library (thank goodness) instead of purchasing it. This is the first time that I've read/listened to any of her books. It took me a while to get into it everytime I started to listen, I'd pop the cd out and choose a different audio book. I like to listen to books as I work. I did this until I only had Mistral's Kiss left before I had to go back to the library for fresh material. The story is thinnnnnnnnn! And it's very annoying that the reader couldn't pronounce Mistral correctly! Other than that which is very annoying by the way..Mister al is how she pronunces it, the book has made me want to check others that she's written, perhaps they will be better. I always love to find an author with a large vein of material to mine."
1,What happened to LKH?,"I am/was a huge Laurel K. Hamilton fan, but for the past few Anita books, and this book for the Merry Gentry series I have to ask what has Mrs. Hamilton been writing? Nothing but sex and fluff. Her books used to be more than just this. She used to write strong 3 dimensional characters, but sadly are now reduced to sex puppets. The sex in her stories alone used to be intriguing and flowed with the plot...now they are the plot. Her books have been falling short these past few times I am sad to say. If I wanted to read sex stories I'd head to the erotica section, but I am looking for a story. Besides this book is way to short to even be called a novel and to even demand the price on the dust jacket is absurd."
1,MISTRAL'S KISS,"This book is so boring I nearly didn't finish it. Like the vampire hunter series which I dropped after about 5 books because there was no plot just sex (the sex doesn't bother me, but really wheres the story) I would be ashamed to call any of this series detective novels, the only thing being discovered is how raunchy the sex can get and with how many. I was inspired to purchase this installment after a passable predecessor. Originally the lack of plot in the third installment had convienced me I was done with this, But my daughter bought me the 4th book and I thought maybe the bad reviews had taken there tole and maybe LKH had decided to actually write a book. WRONG....."
2,The author gone crazy?,"I have no idea what has happened to Laurell K. Hamilton. The first two books in the series were good, then she ran out of plot. It is the only way to explain it. The following books do no make any sense and Mistral's Kiss in no exeption. The sex is interesting, to say the least but you need, at least, the reseamblance of a plot to make a book interesting and worth reading. It is so bad I cannot even grade it. I am sorely dissapointed."
3,Talk about a roller coaster,"I've been a loyal LKH fan for years and I have all of the books in the Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry series and several of them in hardback because I'm just too impatient to wait for paperback and get them the day they come out...however, with this one I started reading it, had to put it down and actually forgot about it. I have NEVER done that with one of her books before. But lately it seems to be happening a good deal. They're losing their spark that we all love and becoming more like erotica. I mean I understand Merry needs to get pregnant but she just needs to get on with the plot some more instead of sex scene after sex scene, fight, sex, fight some more... It was a decent book but the plot needs to continue and it could have been so much better."
2,Disappointed by LKH again,"I found this a short story not a full novel and am very disappointed in the new direction LKH is taking with her writing style, not only with this story line but with her other one as well where I feel that the main character is stopping the plot every few pages for a therapy session, i.e. how do you feel about that? Her earlier books are on my bookshelf, but her newer stuff is going to the used book store for resale."
3,I was a little disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy LKH's work, but this book, like another reviewer has stated, should have been added to Stroke of Midnight.It picks up right after that book.Merry does realize some things in this book. However for those who have not bought this book yet, unless you like books in hardcover, wait. Buy it in Paperback. Read it at the library to see if it would be worth you money to buy, buy it at a discounted price somewhere if it is. I don't really think it was worth the 23.95 price tag on the cover, maybe $15 would have been better.I was looking for some more development on the plot for Merry there wasn't much in this book."
3,Read this in the store,"This novel was OK. The sex wasn't hot to me (too much rough stuff and voyeurism), the length was short, and no one character progressed remarkably in their emotional development in terms of the group dynamic created by LKH. Powers and myths were awakened, but for being in the horrifying and wonderful setting of sidhe, I wasn't horrified or moved. I did feel disgust at well-drawn details, which is more than most novels provoke.Sticking this at the end of the last novel would have been great, since I'd feel cheated if I'd bought this book. Instead I read in the bookstore during a ninety minute deadtime while holiday shopping.On the plus side, setting, plotting, and characterization did occur. That is such a step up from LKH's Anita series, that it gets three stars."
2,Lost her place?,"In the last two books of this series the author seems to have lost the thread of her overall plot. Yes, there's lots of sex of the uninhibited kind, but having said that, nothing much seems to be happening with the basic underlying story line. I've encountered this before (see the Wheel of Time books)or, for another sexual-themed series, the Gor novels. it's too bad, the first couple of books had some real plot. The last two apparently occurred all in one night - and the night isn't over yet."
1,A magical nightmare,"Many reviewers have written about the (endless) sex in LKH's books. In reading Mistral's Kiss, it seems to me that besides sex, Miss Hamilton is trying to imagine a world that is driven by magic. One where visions come true. While this is a great idea in principle, the lack of plot and disjointed writing makes it feel more like a 1960's acid trip of a book than something written today. Think Magical Mystery Tour (the movie) without a great soundtrack. Sadly good or bad acid trips are really not my thing.I would have written a review about the actual story, but there really isn't one."
1,4 Thumb down,I would not recommend this book to anyone; it does not worth the money and the time. I can find the same unreliable facts anywhere.
2,Beats me!,"Beats me how the majority of the reviews gushed over how soft & silky these sheets were. I apparently got a set of the sheets some of the others reviewed. They are still stiff after 4 washings, & even when washed in cold water & removed from the dryer immediately they are wrinkly. I kept thinking they would get nice & soft with use & washing, but no luck. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Generous and Sleek at Moderate Price ~~!!,"Wonderfully smooth and sleek, without piling or the annoying shine of satin sheets; colourfast and quite smooth, also, after laundering.Great value for the cost!More generous than usual top sheet, and the fitted bottom sheetamply accommodates pillow top mattresses nicely, also.These sheets are genuine value! A+++++"
3,"Average book on Delphi, but lacks depth in Delphi 3","Using Delphi 3, Special Edition is a decent book on Delphi, but doesn't cover most of the new features or benifits of Delplhi 3. Virtually nothing was said on the new component packages technology, most of the new components & tools, and virtually nothing on the new features of the code editor and enviornment.That said this is an average book on Delphi programming, and has a few good examples and sample programs. A lot of the information can be gotten from the Delphi manuals and on-line help, and most of the topics are not very advanced.This book doesn't stand out as ""got to have"" or reference text and is very misleading claiming to be a book on Delphi 3. Although one of the first to the market for Delphi 3, I'd recommend skipping this one and waiting."
3,"Big Mamma, some issues","Knife had burrs on the handle that required filing. Pins were not flush with handle, needed filing to smooth out grip. Blade does not hold an edge. Sheath reversed and non-functional as intended by the designer. Sheath must have been made by someone wanting to start their weekend early. Nice price, some things fixable if you have the time and patience to correct them. Good for throwing at target"
2,Daring the Highlander,Not a very convincing tale. The auther obviously does not know Scotland or Scotish history very well. Rather a waste of time.
4,Romance in Scotland,"Scottish highlands, swords, independent women, virile men -- what's not to like? It will keep you reading for the adventure."
2,Needs more tension...,The two characters fall in love because they are the same person. No tension between the the two. The plot otherwise is pretty good. But it's super important to two separate and interesting main characters. If you're looking for sexual tension...keep looking.
4,Interesting story,I enjoyed this book. It had some interesting twists in it. I like reading about the old days in the Highlands and this was about a very poor clan as opposed to books where the clans are reasonably wealthy for that time frame. If you like reading about the Scottish clans you should enjoy this book.
4,Great,"Daring the highlander was a really good book, and a really interesting read. It kept you interested and wanting to carry on reading from the first page to the last. It gave you a really good idea of life in Scotland during that era."
2,deceptive title,"This was listed as a LifePac Accounting set, but was actually only a teacher's book.Was expecting the set and only received the teacher's book. Very disapointed."
3,Poor case for original sin,"I read this book in school years ago. Although it's an okay read, I think the author's message is off-base. I was taught that the boys' nature represents original sin.I write this criticism based solely on the author's intention. Whether I believe in original sin or not- Golding's metaphor falls short when tring to connect the boys' nature to original sin (which suggests that man is born sinful).In LOTF, the boys are obviously not born on the island and did not just show up as clean slates. We know almost nothing about how they'd been raised- just that up until the island, they HAD been raised elsewhere; therefore, the case for original sin is difficult to swallow. Are we to believe that the boys' ruthless behavior on the island is independent from their upbringings?Or maybe this just becomes a good excuse.. if we're damned anyway?I can think of a dozen better books for required reading!"
3,good for bookreports for school,As a dutch-speaking person it is difficult to read this book. Sometimes there are too many pages for a small action. Positive: you can dream that you're on the island yourself (paradise).... . But I wouldn't read it if it wasn't obliged by school.
1,Truth,"This book does not hold the views of the true church of Christ. This book said that people must be entertained to get them to come to worship. We do not go to worship services to be entertained, we go to worship God. We must follow the Bible if we are to go to Heaven, not what men say we must do."
3,Useful,"I found this to be a clear and well presented book overall, enough so I found I didn't want to start this technique until I did some major re-arrangement of my studio space. Given that I haven't tried working through the tutorials, so really can't comment about them.Some seem annoyed at the art and artists presented - get over it. Art is about process, not product, learn about and experience what others have done then do your own thing. If you live somewhere with good art museums then seek out work by others that is in the genre that suits your tastes.I'll keep this book as reference when I do start my experiments with wax - so far it's the best I've seen in print."
5,Covers many topics well.,"Considered by many to be the best book on encaustic painting to date, Joann Mattera covers a wide variety of subjects in this engaging, well-photographed book. In addition to a wealth of bright, gorgeous photos of contemporary and traditional encaustic work, the author provides practical instructions and recipes for the aspiring encaustic artist. If you are an artist -- or an art lover -- this is one book that should be part of your collection!"
1,Think about it,"It's kind of funny. All these books that prove that Jesus did ""not exist."" I wonder if the authors considered the fact that hundreds of secular sources away from the Bible talked about Jesus. Not necessarily about the fact about who he claimed to be, but the fact that he was a real person, with a pretty powerful following. I am not a historian, but there is proof that Christ exists other than the Bible. If you are considering reading a book like this, first do some research and read some non-Christian historical sources that talk about the existence of Christ. Not for the fact that he is the savoir. That is for you to decide."
4,Nice.,"As with most collections/compilations there's always some songs where you wonder why they are even included on there, but for the most part this captures Roy's essence and includes a lot of his best ; which, for Everybody Loves The Sunshine, Running Away, & a couple others this CD is well worth having Plus I got it @ an awesome reduced holiday price."
5,Gorgeous doll,"This is a beautiful platinum blonde TNT repro from 1968 with an outfit that really resonates with the late 60s mod craze. The colors are incredibly bright,crisp,cheerful and with lots of good vibe going on."
4,Sparrow Boy to the Rescue,"This is a very inspirational book for young children. It also has wonderful illustrations, a great visual aid for the reader.The story is written in a comic book fashion which can really appeal to a certain audience. This book can teach a child that even if you're only a paper boy/girl that you can still do big things with it and no matter who you are you can always make a difference, it all depends on how far you are willing to take your imagination."
3,a scattershot collection 1965-1979,this is an interesting collection in that it takes songs from the years 1965-1979 & shows Cher in many different lights-also with Sonny as well-i would've liked to have seen even more variety in the styles of the selections-but all in all it does collect some from 1971-1974 that have about half of the albums of that period on it- & has a few not well known Sonny Bono compositions in there
4,Focused,"This book was far more focused than the last in this series, the previous one (All I Want is Everything) being the worst in the series. I would have to say this is so far the best and just miiight top the first one, which I enjoyed so much. This is definetly Blair's book and some things we learn about her are interesting...but there is not so much of Serena. Mostly Blair, Dan & Vanessa, Jenny, and Nate. It showed the characters in reasonable situations, unlike some previous laugable ones. In addition, the author seems to have proofread this one a little more carefully than those in the past. Although this series isn't wildly intellingent (or close), it is highly entertaining and addictive...just like gossip. The characters now have a little more depth and are far more respectable, even when they are at their worst. It's worth the read."
4,Awesome!,"This is an awesome book. It's a lot juicier than the third one and I think I like it as much as the first two! The new characters actually are interesting-- a lot more than Flo was, in ""All I Want is Everything"". It's February in New York and there's a whole lot of fashion shows going on and of course Serena is in them. I can't wait for the fifth one in the series! They're addicting."
1,THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER TRIED TO READ,"I'm shocked. It really worries me that so many girls my age read these books. I don't like to sound like a parent, but these books set a really bad example. The characters are so spoiled, it's disgusting. And they're mean, not to mention slutty. How can this book be a bestseller? It's trash. Don't people get bored with girls acting trashy and sleeping around? Look, read what you want, but parents should be warned about this book. Gossip Girl is NOT WORTH IT!"
1,filth,"this book is filth. i saw the endless same stories as the first ones. it was a drastic move, but they made it, and got my worst review of the year. i hate to stamp on the legacy, but teen books are going down in flames. you see, angus, thongs, and ffs was the best and none can comepare. dont walte your breath, and dont write a review"
3,Guilty pleasure,"So, I think to myself, 'finally! Some consequences!' but it seems that rehab is just another excuse to party. Oh, well. It's still so much fun to read this crap."
4,Because it's worth it,"I gave this book four stars, because that's what it deserved. It kind of annoyed me, the way everyone became every MORE hoity-toity and snobbish, but it's addictive and one of those books you have to keep reading. I did like it, but it kind of felt like something was missing. Hopefully, the emptiness will be filled with the next book."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I own all 4 of the GG books. I don't know why I just admitted that, because they're all incredibly shallow and stupid. It's my guilty pleasure; I only read it because I'm feeling ditzy or want to have some more of the brand-name dropping. Honestly, I read it for the type of scene they live in. No more, no less. It's because the author is REALLY BAD at writing. Anybody can churn out junk like this; all they need to do is drop the Louis Vuitton Alma purse and Juicy Couture Velour Sweatsuit in every other chapter and you've got GG. It's bad writing, bad humor, underdeveloped characters, etc. I could go on & on. For all you kids who think this is the best book you've ever read, please get out of your uneducated self and READ some REAL literature. I recommend a Confederacy of Dunces, or the Awakening."
2,MCK-142Pro Keyboard Key Cap Lettering Wears Off,"I've really enjoyed using the Adesso MCK-142Pro Keyboard. The only issue I've encountered is that the lettering on the top of the most used key caps wears off after a few weeks. The manufacturer sent me a full set of replacement key caps as part of the warranty and advised that the only solution to the problem is to apply finger nail polish to each replacement key cap to slow down the wear. I'm disappointed that such an expensive keyboard won't hold up to normal use, and that there is not a better remedy."
5,Trunk Lift Support,These trunk lift's were hard to find. They fit great and work properly. Received on time and the price was the cheapest.
5,Great for Exercise & Compact,This is great way to exercise in your home. It is very easy to assemble and store. Great exercise for the knees and waist line. Highly recommend you to purchase this item.
5,"Same book, different title","This is a renamed edition of Engel's fine 2002 book, ""A Dab of Dickens & A Touch of Twain: Literary Lives from Shakespeare's Old England to Frost's New England."" I purchased this thinking Engel had written a sequel, but sadly, it is not the case."
3,Not they are fundamental,Buy these bags for my portable bathroom but my conclusion is that they are not indispensable. They are easily replaceable for a bag of garbage or a normal bag of supermarket.
5,"Excellent, impressive and useful",I bought for my daughter and is working excellent for her. She is been taking that everywhere and excited to find quick information for which she had to go to internet lot of times. Pretty useful and handy!!!
3,Sharp PW-E250 Electronic Dictionary,This is a good electronic dictionary. I only wish it had derivations. I like the back light feature.
5,"25 years later, still doesn't feel dated","The events in this book will reach their 25th anniversary a few months from my writing this review, and the only things that feel stale are the salary figures. The book has a deceptively simple concept: nine chapters, one for each inning, but with descriptions of the game events and extended reflections on why they happened, mostly from the perspective of his hosts, the Milwaukee Brewers. For example, when Milwaukee's Ted Simmons comes to bat, Orkent discusses the machinations behind the trade that brought Simmons to the Brewers in the first place. Orkent, one of the godfathers of fantasy baseball, and now the Public Editor of the New York Times, is a truly gifted writer. This is fine baseball writing, suitable even for fans who have yet to celebrate their 25th anniversaries on Earth. It's so good that if I pulled it out in another 25 years, it would still be relevant and beautiful."
3,Great idea but author did not follow through,"A couple of things I was not thrilled about: 1. He mainly talked about the Milwaukee Brewers significantly more than the Baltimore Orioles. 2. He talked way too much about the management issue of the Brewers (how they were relocated, payroll). Other than that it's a fun book to read but there needed to be more baseball discussion rather than discussion of topics that isn't really baseball at the core."
3,An interesting but mostly one sided look at a baseball game.,"As an Orioles fan, I was disappointed. Okrent discusses in great depth the Brewers players, media, and management, but only briefly touches on the Orioles counterparts. The concept of the book was to cover one game inning by inning, but a game is played by two teams, not one. I also noticed two errors, one a date and one a misattributed quote."
5,The Fox Still Has It!,"Whether 8 (when I first warched) or 59 (enjoying watching again) years old, these episodes still draw me in. From the ""Out of the night when the full moon is bright comes a horseman known as Zorro"" start of theme song, to the happy ending, these episodes do not disappoint. They brought back many happy memories of sitting in front of the small screen watching every week with my family and friends. My first crush, Guy Williams, remains one of the best looking men to ever grace the tv screen. Others have played the part, but in my opinion, he is the ultimate Zorro. I'll be getting the second season soon. Thanks, Disney, for getting this treasure out there for us young at heart folks to enjoy. I can highly recommend this DVD set. You'll love it!"
4,The Informants POV,"Quite good acting and cinematography. Script and directing were well done but not on a par with the acting and filming. Some of the editing made following the storyline a bit more confusing than it needed to be and to that add a storyline that's a little too shallow at times particularly the different character subplots.Informants and their interaction with police is the primary storyline whereas that story is customarily a secondary thought in crime genre movies. Heavily tragedy oriented, so be prepared."
2,Awful.,"I bought this book because I was looking for some hairstyles beyond those found in basic books on braids and updos.There are some styles in this book in addition to the standard ropes, twists and French braids. They involve twisting your hair into zig-zags, looping, weaving a ribbon into your hair, or tying your hair into a big bow on the back of your head. These styles are ugly! Just plain atrocious-looking! Trashy and/or bizarre. Salon Ovations should be able to do better than that.If you don't already own a copy, there is no more helpful or beautifully illustrated book for updos and braids than ""Hair: A Book of Braiding and Styles"""" by Anne Akers Johnson. There are far more styles represented than in the Salon Ovations book, and they are better illustrated...for half the price. If you are looking for some good styles in addition to those in ""Hair"", you won't find them in this book."
1,poor customer service,"Amazon says my order has shipped, however the company emailed me that this would arrive well after Christmas. When asked if they could get it here by an early date in January there was no response."
5,Large and sturdy,This has exceeded our expectations as it is quite large and sturdy with moving parts that keep my 3YO's interest. My only complaint is trying to match animals sizes to the size of this stable. It would have been nice to have had some tips or a product recommendation on what size horses to purchase as the Schleich ones are really too small.
4,great gift,This was a great purchase for any horse lover! My daughter is 7. She has a variety of horse sizes. She has been putting other farm animals along with the horses. She had the fisher price farm set when she was little this was great for now and for the future. It folds up great! Great gift for boys or girls
1,Not worth the money!!,"I purchased one less than a year ago and the plastic by the hinge cracked within a year! Since you can't fix plasic, the trash can is now trash!!"
1,Not as good as it seems. Don't waste your money.,I bought this in hopes to have an XM radio/mp3 player to listen to while running. Here are the things I dislike about this unit:#1: Live XM only works while the unit is plugged into the base with the antenna attached.#2: You can only use 50% (500 megs) of the 1 gigabyte total storage for mp3's.#3: The user interface is terrible and unintuitive.
5,Great XM Radio,"This XM radio is terrific - small & compact, but with lots of memory for recording my favorite music - and all at a great price. Outstanding value!"
5,One Of Comics Greatest Geniuses,"From the beginning to the end, I could not stop laughing. Scott Adams knows how to spin humour into the horrible world of businesses and life in general. In a way it's like The Simpsons, only a bit more serious and deep. The characters still keep their roles pretty well, not changing much. Dilbert stays ""normal"", Dogbert stays machiavellian and so on. Once in a while a character changes, but this is intended. This is easily one of the best books I've read. The script never dies out, the pace never slackens and once you've put it down, you have a serious impulse to pick it up again and laugh yourself silly."
3,Ok I guess,"The product was shipped quickly and packed well, but I thought it would be heavier and have more detail. It reminds me more of the stuff you see at the corner quickstop gas/food type retailers, you know - like at a Circle K, 7-11 type store, sitting on the counter at the check out for $5.00. I'll wear it though occasionally. I do like garnets and snakes."
1,Didnt work,"When I turned the scale it didnt work. I tried batteries and adapter. Just blue light turns on, but then nothing happens. Very disappointing."
5,great scale!,"I'm a packaging engineer who often has to weigh products and packaging materials.All units of measure are covered: decimal pounds, pounds and ounces, ounces, grams, and kilograms.The scale is very sensitive at low weights, but still goes up to 75lb capacity.The detachable (on a cable tether) control panel/display allows you to put very large items on the scale, and still be able to read the display.It's small and lightweight.All in all, exactly what I was looking for!"
2,Just boring.,"I didn't make it to the end of this slow-paced, excruciatingly detailed novel. The characters, Jew and Arab alike, were more stereotypes than real human beings. The scenes written from the killer's point of view were embarrassingly overwritten; I don't like this technique as a rule, but these were among the worst I've seen. I'm a fan of richly detailed settings and slow-moving plots when a book is written well enough and has characters whose side stories are interesting enough, but this one didn't make the grade.On a side note to those who have criticized this book's racist portrayal of overtones: I felt that the tone of the book was meant to reflect the prejudices of the main character. Maybe I'm attributing too much subtlety to Kellerman in assuming this was all intentional, but it would have been pointlessly naive for him to put pro-Arab sentiments in the mind of a conservative Israeli Jew."
3,"Okay, but hardly a new subject","With the emphasis today on women's rights and privileges, I sometimes worry that the reverse is true: that men are the ones being cheated. Why doesn't someone write about them?"
2,Enough with the hawk.,"First of all I love animals, and we have rescued a hawk with a broken wing. We took him to a rescue center for treatment. Plus I have animals, alot of them. When your love ones are in danger you don't worry more about a wild animal than people you love. The book was too much work to read, I did not enjoy it. I kept reading it thinking it had to get better, it didn't. I will probably never read her books again."
3,"Ok, not the best quality.","Bought this as a replacement for our above ground pool. The old parts were worn out, discolored and broken from ice after winter. But the quality of this is definitely even lower than that. When installing it I could tell the parts were a little bit cheaper and don't have as much of a perfect snug fit.Considering the price however, I would recommend it for replacement, if you must save money. The pool is holding up fine and no signs of leaks or anything. The price was good as the local pool place charges much more.Still, I'll have to see how long this product stays in condition. So bottom line, consider getting a better quality replacement, but if you really want to save money, this will do."
5,This album is off da hook!,"I can't believe how good this cd is, previously i had never heard of Mr.Jones and no i'm not a comercial rap buyer. I am an avid hip hop fan and love any new talent that presents itself to me. However, i do luv all the old playas like Nas, Snoop & Pun. ALL DA TRACKS ON DIS CD ARE DA BOMB (excluding all skits). Go out and buy this album....furthermore copy it off your mate for a listening experience like no other. ONE."
3,Dog show shoes,Shoes are exactly as I expected. Laces are bit long and need to be tied twice so as not to step on them while in the show ring.
1,Too many illegible headwords!,The print of too many headwords is just illegible! I hope that the publisher will re-make the printing plates.
5,john moore,"bought this, and it is great. looks good, works good, easy to clean. i will only buy calphalon cook ware from now on. have bought several pieces of this brand, and love using it. i don't think that you can get any better than this brand of cook ware."
1,Don't Buy It,"I have the RevoStyler which I love but the brushes are wearing down so I ordered this one. It is completely worthless. It pulls your hair and does not style at all. The brush rotation is so fast and violent that the minute you get it close to your hair, it yanks it up to the scalp. Don't waste your time or money"
1,Get their first album instead,I own this cd. Not a single cut worth a listen. You can get both of their hits (Rock It and Shake It) on their first album (Day in the Life) or on numerous bass compilations.
5,Wet Land Voices,Captivating. In reviewing this book I felt like I was transported to the scene being depicted and reveled in the splendor and majesty of mother nature.
4,Informative analysis of today's American religious scene,"This book, written in 1998, takes an objective look at the varieties of religious expression in America at the end of the 20th century and projects the observed trends into the new millennium. This is good information for anyone to have, whether one is a ""seeker"", a casual observer, or a devoted follower of a particular religion. It covers the ""mix-and-match"" religious experiences that are popular in some areas as well as the tradional religions who are embracing new methodology to impact today's society. The influence of religion in the social and political arenas is also addressed quite extensively. One subject the authors glossed over a little too quickly is the impact of televangelism and the effect it has on religious beliefs and practices. For good or for ill, televangelism has a much greater impact, at least in America's heartland, than the authors indicate. Otherwise, this book is very comprehensive and never ceases to be interesting."
4,A Good Biography,"This is a good video biography. Contained very little I did not already know about Amelia Earhart, but was forthright , no ""hype"" or glamourizing of Amelia. The photo & film strip quality is very good considering the age of the material."
2,Useful for rounding out Rogues; nothing outstanding,"I'd buy this book again because you can never have too many feats or prestige classes, especially for the always hard to play rogue. But in a word, this supplement is uninspired. Just a collection of mostly mediocre stuff of no great pizzaz. A few of the prestige classes are interesting (although the bard is severely shorted here). A few of the feats and spells are of interest. Most of the rest of it is of limited interest unless you like elaborate traps in which case it might be a tad more interesting for you.Of the 4 class supplements I have (Tome & Blood, Sword & Fist, Defenders of the Faith), this one is the worst. Hopefully it was a passing moment of insipidness. Otherwise, the rest of class guidebooks do not look promising."
4,Am I a better rogue and petty knave for owning this book?,"Granted, I am one of WOTC's consumer drones: put a new source book for D&D on the market and I will buy it for my gaming group's library. The section on traps is definitely worth the cost of buying this book especially if your DM will permit your rogue to earn XP for defeating a nasty trap. Otherwise, the prestige classes offered simply give people options for player development. Myself, I favor a cleric/rogue multiclassed character. The saving throws tend to be well-rounded and no one minds that you have a tendency to shun melee combat. Well, except for that lunatic half-orc paladin in the front row....."
4,Pretty Good,"This book is pretty good, I'd say. The prestige classes are pretty good, particularly the Outlaw of the Crimson Road, in my opinion. The feats are nice, too, and the primers on poison and traps are a godsend. Also, the Thieves' Guilds and Bardic Colleges are good, and Nuth's Laws help me immensely. It just seems as though it could have been better. Some of the prestige classes were lacking, to say the least, and some of the feats were less than useful.The artwork was good, especially the sketch of a rogue using many of the ""surgical strike"" feats in the books. Some of the advancement tips were also quite useful. It was a pretty good book, and helped me out, but it definitely could have been better."
5,csi ny,after reviewing prices this was one of the better prices for the few cents difference I believe this was a great price and very fast shipping
4,Fascinating,This sure was a seat grabber for both myself and my wife..but we are sure glad he is back.We are looking forward for more of the show..
3,Great Season But Image Quality is lacking,"Season 8 has it's flaws creatively, but it is definitely one of the better seasons for sure.However, the one thing that bothered me about this DVD set was the image quality. Compared to past seasons of CSI:NY and even this year's releases of CSI and CSI:MIAMI, season eight of CSI:NY has a noticeable dip in quality, possibly due to excessive image compression. Some images are blocky (artifacting) and some jagged images (aliasing) appears in some of the action/tracking shots. I know that this problem isn't because of my equipment, as I own (and tested) the other CSI shows and seasons on the same gear with no other problems.A curious problem to an otherwise great DVD set.If this sort of thing doesn't bother you (and admittedly, after two episodes or more, your eye adjusts) by all means get the this set; CSI:NY is a wonderful show. However, its image quality does hurt the overall presentation."
5,An Amazing Journey Through American Popular Music,"The harmonica has long been the instrument that we associate with America of old. Be it the pioneers crossing the plains, the lonesome cowboy playing to soothe his herd, the hobo playing to fill his hours, the harmonica is the instrument of choice. Affordable and portable, it is the instrument that plays America's soundtrack.Jon Gindick, one of our country's top harmonica instructors, has compiled an extensive collection of American standards for the harmonica and with this double-CD set he shows you how to play these great songs.The instruction is basic and will give any harmonica player a solid foundation in the basics of the instrument. it is a great collection to have for both the beginner and more experienced player. I strongly recommend this collection."
2,just Ok,"I bought these to simply help carve a pumpkin for Halloween. It seemed like a nice set in a decent case but they could hardly go through a pumpkin and got really hot extremely fast. I did not use very much pressure, but after 2 small pin holes the first tip broke then the next lasted a 1inch groove. I'm not sure what you could use these for... I can't imagine something that snaps on a pumpkin being of any use."
3,Nothing Special,"I was really surprised to find myself considerably bored for a large portion of this book. Usually I love books like these: light, funny, and heartfelt. But, unfortunately, this book was none of those. I gave it 3 stars because it had its moments, but it was predictable and monotonous. I actually found the main character unlikable and quite mean at times. I never truly understood why she treated her mother like she did, and it was never portrayed clearly. I would recommend reading it from the library to see if it is your cup of tea before you buy it. I'm very glad I actually won this book in a contest rather than have spent $11 of my own money on it. Pick up ""Born Confused"" or something instead."
1,turns off on its own as if it is its job,the first few months i had this computer it was amazing. then like everyone else it started turning itself off.not worth the money. i can't run anything more then internet explorer without the laptop overheating and turning off. it freaks out when i even try to open itunes.only buy this if you enjoy your computer turning off every 20 mins or you only want a computer that works correctly for a few months.
1,A must to avoid,"We are sending this back for the 4th time in the span of a year for the same problem. They refuse to consider replacing the unit although it has clearly not worked throughout its working life. Customer service inflexible. It has shut down without consent of user for no reason whatsoever, repeatedly. When it works, it's okay."
4,Excellent product...,"I got my pedals few weeks ago and have been using them almost on a dayly basis. The design is sturdy and although I have not ""forced the issue"", I feel confident that the pedals would hadle any kind of abuse. Installation was easy and a perfect fit with the rest of my CH flight controls.The only problem that I have with the design is that the pedals are too close together. Sure they are perfect for a GA cockpit simulation, but when I tried to build my own cockpit with the joystick between my legs it was a problem.Regardless, I am happy I got them and now I cannot 'fly' without them... :)"
3,its ok,the pedals have a hard ime staying in place durring normal game play and are almost impossible to use durring spirited play. If you figure out a way to get them to stay put they aren't a bad choice
4,Nice pedals,"These work good--take's allot to get used to. The detent though (to center them), built in-- I wish they didn't have it."
5,As real as it gets,"I'm using these rudder pedals under Vista with no problems at all. Good rudder pedals make flight sims much, much better. If you don't have pedals already and like to fly you won't go wrong with these.IL2, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 and FSX"
4,good value,Works well and is sturdy for the money. Toe break is over responsive and do not need the rim at back of heel but cannot justify the $600 for the next level of rudder control.
1,Overhyped,"I do not understand how this product contiues to get such great reviews. I fly small general aviation aircraft and these rudder pedals do not even come close to the real thing. The pedals have no feel to them and they do not have any method of adjusting the resistance. I had to adjust them so that their response was not linear just so they would operate in a reasonable fashion. I do not know if its the pedals or the flight model for the Cessna 172 in both Fs9 and Fs 10, but I am unable to perform a adequate forward or side slip. I've tried adjusting them, and that does seem to help some, but my biggest complaint is that they have not resistance to them."
5,Best of the Booth Brothers!,Excellent! These guys don't know how to do a poor program. They seem so convinced of their message and the harmony and vocals are out of this world. They seem so solid in their personal as well as in their professional lives. I'm sure God smiles on them every time they perform.
1,a gift to those standing in line.,"Most of the reviews of this album talk about the title track and Flexible, but i think that the mix of Something To Do is very important as well, and it's the reason i bought the cd. WAY LONG TIME AGO when Violator came out there was a signing party in LA, and it got busted up by the cops. All the people that stood in line but did not get in were given a copy of the metal mix of Something To Do. As someone with many singles and several bootlegs of DM material, i think this is positively one of the best mixes of all time, like the death mix of Fly on the Windscreen. The heavy emphasis on the tremble electronic sounds, so typical of 80's electro-pop, is energizing rather than cheesy. And although i like the spareness of some of DM's music, i fill like this mix is fuller, and more resolved. it makes me want to dance, and cry...what more is there to say?"
5,ULTIMATE EDDY ARNOLD,The CD contains many of Eddy's hits. It is by Eddy Arnold what more could you ask for
3,Family night game,"A great toy for Family night. Quite a lot of fun. Fast paced action. NO batteries required! Although, should you have a little one who is strong, a lane on the track will break quickly. Over all a nice toy."
2,great concept but...,"I love the idea of this low-tech old-fashioned toy. The players repeatedly shoot a marble into a hole as fast as they can, which moves the horse forward. The problem is that two out of four of the horses were broken when we opened the toy: The blue horse didn't move forward, and the yellow pull-back lever to shoot the marble for the yellow horse was broken. It's a pretty big game (almost 3 feet long) and now I just want the game out of my house but I don't know how to dispose of it. But it's very inexpensive, and pretty fun, so you might want to take a chance on it..."
4,Everything you didn't know you needed to know about Minsk (and elsewhere),"I was surprised to see this only got six reviews - though to judge from the price (!) it must have sold OK. AA is quite highly regarded on this side of the pond, and she certainly put in the legwork here. (Though I suspect whoever arranged the itinerary is the unsung hero.) Maybe it was the non-attention-grabbing title that put folks off; if so, good for her - many's the time I've been snared by a meretricious title like any callow youth lured by a saucy cover. This is a lovely mix of interviews with background history, an easy read from which you'll learn much. More on amazon.co.uk"
2,Go with the original!!!,"I love the original Butt Paste. So, I figured the ""all natural"" kind had to be just as good or better, right? WRONG! Usually, the original only takes a day or two at the most to completely clear up a diaper rash. I've used this natural kind on my daughter at every diaper change for the last three days, and her rash looks almost exactly the way it did to begin with. Now I have to go out and purchase some of the original kind to actually get rid of the rash. If you use diaper rash daily to prevent a rash, then this will likely be fine. But, if you need to use it to actually get rid of a diaper rash, get the original in the yellow packaging!!"
1,the biggest peice of crap EVER!,"I bought the COBY MP-CD455 from a store (not amazon) as I needed a portable CD player/Radio for my desk at work. The radio works fine but the CD player is crap. There is ZERO anti-shock and even brand new CD's skip, even without any vibrations. It completely refuses to play my Tom Waits ""Foreign Affairs"" album as it spins the CD and recognizes how many tracks there are, but then theres just no sound. Finally, I cannot skip through the tracks on most of my CDs as doing so causes the unit to reset. I have to listen to the entire CD to get to the track I want. Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging and receipt before testing the CD player so now Im stuck with this $40 peice of garbage. I sent COBY a pretty nasty E-mail, which not surprisingly they havent responded to. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, OR ANY OTHER, PRODUCT BEARING THE NAME COBY. I AM VERY UNHAPPY AND AM PERSONALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SMASHING THIS THING INTO A HUNDRED PEICES!"
3,"Okay, not great","I bought it primarily to play mp3s. It seems to work on the two discs I have tried so far. The electrical cable doesn't fit right, and I have to constantly keep reattaching it."
3,Too big for rim,"This was probably a fluke but this 700C tire was too big for my 700C rim i.e. it wouldn't stay on. So was the replacement. The process for getting and returning both the original tire and the replacement couldn't have been easier, though."
3,"cute, but...","I was excited to find a pull toy w/ music for my daughters crib. Its a good size works well but has button eyes, not safe for babies. So I hang it on the outside of the crib. Once she's able to grab at it I'll have to remove it altogether. All infant dolls, toys should just not have button eyes. duh."
4,"Great poster, albeit a couple months late","I love the poster, but I ordered it sometime in April and received it sometime in July. Definitely a quality product, but lacking in quality service. Not recommended for impatient customers!"
4,I'm so proud of you!,this cd really deserves 5 stars as far as i'm concerned but i'm stoked to give their next release 5 stars cause their new stuff is totally rad. this cd is stuck in my car cd player (heh it really is- i have a crappy cd player) but if i could choose any cd to be stuck in there this would be the one. if you haven't seen aoag live yet add it to your list of things to do before you die. seriously after seeing them live whenever i listen to the cd i just see dewey the machine rockin out and jon bustin his sassy studmuffin moves. yea for ak boys!
3,Michael Jackson - The Awards Collection,"The DVD is grainy in areas and slowly moving to watch. However, it does have some interesting footage of the King of Pop and at those moments I was glad I purchased it."
1,Terrible Quality,"Amazon should not be selling this video. The quality is terrible. It appears to be home recordings of events that were recorded, primarily, from Japanese TV.It does not include spme of teh really great awards and presentations, like the 25th year of MTV, 25th year of Motown, etc. It is a waste of money and makes me feel totally different about Amazon."
2,Video Game or Drawing Board?,"this game is a hair better than budokai one.the graphics are bad and you can see the outlines.worst of all the story mode,unlike the first is like a board game.Each player must take turns moving.It takes so long to finish this game Im positive you could watch the Masters Tournament with delays and play 2 complete games of chess before its done. And the final faulty,s.s.3 goku does not have any more power than normal form. A WASTE!!!!!!!!"
2,Good and bad,"For someone who has a very poor exercise regime record, this was a great way to get myself back into some sort of routine! But - if you're planning on doing it every day or two, it gets very repetitive and boring. I'm not sure if it was Denise or my pregnancy hormones, but I really started hating her, the unmoving hair, the permanent grin and the little pep talk... So - a great introduction to fitness when pregnant, but be prepared to move on pretty quickly. If only there was something to move onto..."
4,Good Mix,"I work out a lot and demand a good workout. This is a little easy for me but I like it because I am obviously supposed to take it easier working out for two! (If it got me pooped then I'd give it a 5!) The moves are very simple yet are some good exercises (like side abs, for example). She also makes sure you're doing things correctly, explaining certain positions, etc. I like the touch of having a physician Q&A, too. This is an old video for her, but I really like it. I finish up my workout with the last few minutes of the Buns of Steel-8 video (which I wasn't as impressed with). I recommend this to anyone of any fitness level."
1,Don't waste your money and your time,"If you have already read a lot about Ireland and/or you have been there, do not waste your money on this book. It is poorly written and full of inaccuracies. I was entranced by the title and I guess purchased it because of the title but now I am sorry that I did. It is simply not a good read. There are so many very beautiful books available written about journeys in Ireland. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Uninspiring - I couldn't get rid of them fast enough,"They had a weird energy to me, and very dark. I don't know if I got a bad batch, but my readings weren't accurate and these pictures were dull and the background was black. Something was off - can't pinpoint it."
1,No One is Naughty,"This dvd is just a bunch of porn stars & nude models getting interviewed at an Adult Con. Everyone stays clothed. Interviews are all under a couple of minutes each. Some hold up their 2007 projects, others prance about in their benefactor's clothing like Hustler. Do NOT buy this unless you want to watch these women talk for a minute about meeting fans & the like. I would give it 0 stars, but I cant."
4,Deceptively simple,"This is a wonderful soundtrack! Full, rich and complex upon several listens. The opening theme makes my blood race! (I probably shouldn't listen to this while reading the news of the presidential primaries...too much rushing blood in your body is not a good thing!)Anyway, a REALLY good soundtrack."
2,for simpletons,"I read the entire set in an afternoon and it did not capture my attention as I'd hoped. Obviousley written written to an elementary school level (well it seemed that way to me, but I'm a genius). I definately recommend it for a decent short read as it only has a little over 6000 pages it shouldn't take anyone longer than a couple of hours. luckily the material and scientific content are so easy to understand."
4,Fine update on themes introduced in Polyarchy,"This is a highly readable summary of Dahl's earlier work. Non-academics will find his use of dialogue easily accessible. Perhaps it's greatest success is the way that it thoughtfully approaches the basic premises of democracy, foundational principles all too-often glossed over in democratic literature."
1,Cheaply made,"These fog lights are not worth the money! Put them on my 4runner in California and drove to Colorado and when I got there the yellow coating was gone and I had white fog lights again. When I finally got home, one of the bulbs blew out. What are the chances? Cheaply made."
5,The Other Side......ROCKS!!!,"""The Other Side""...ROCKS!! I LOVE ""Amazing Grace""!! ""I Love You This Much"" brought tears to my eyes... This whole album is very uplifting and inspiring! I LOVE all the songs on this album!! WAY TO GO BILLY RAY!!#1 Billy Ray Cyrus & DOC Fan!"
5,Best effort,I truly believe this is Billy Ray's finest effort to date.The songs are beautiful and really showcase his great voice.
4,Real Estate Principles,"The book has a lot of stuff to learn in just a chapter. It does teach you a lot but it would be better if they spread it out a little. Other than that, I give it 4 stars."
3,Where are the chords?,"The musical arrangements are OK, however this is a JAZZ guitar book. A CHORD-melody book. Jazz is based on very complex chords, and the left hand is used to form these chords on the fretboard while the right hand plucks or strums away. Chords are usually notated above the music staff, either in name and/or diagram form, to guide the player where to put the hands while playing. This book lacks that notation, thus literally doubling the work for the player. Would you enjoy figuring out that your hand should be in the 2nd string F#m7-5 position, or the 2nd string Eb13-9 position? Some chord notations please, Howard!"
4,I would recommend this book.,Very similar to other near death experiences I have read. I liked the book and would recommend it to others. It gives a great insight to what could happen before Christ can come and how to be prepared. More important to me how we should act toward one another when it does occur. Thanks for sharing you experience with us.
2,Only OK.,I do not believe she actually experienced this as I was lead to believe. There are too many other stories that make more sense. It was OK reading. If I had known the contents I would not have purchased the book.
2,Disassociated and meandering,"Though I have a fairly open thought processing capability, I had a hard time following her story line and making it make sense. Sorta like looking through a gauze curtain at a fuzzy panorama. Not well written. I didn't catch any excitement nor revelation."
5,Through the Windows of Life,"I wanted to read this book because from a series of books I just read about the last days the author recommended that I read this book. I read the whole thing in a few hours, and felt lifted and strengthened by all that was said. I could never give this book away because I want to review it and remember the things that were said that gave me strength. I appreciate the author for sharing her experiences with me and many others who have read it."
4,Winsome Wood Swivel Seat Stool,"They almost matched my existing stools, which I was very pleased with and they were easy to assemble. I do not know how they will last, because I have not had them that long."
4,Windsome stool,"Stool was what we were looking for, though the back was a little shorter than anticipated. We were trying to replace a similar kitchen stool and this one fits the bill completely."
2,Winsome Wood Stool.,"This is a beautiful stool..however it was not for me. If you have a ""large back porch"", you will always feel like you are slipping forward! I am 73 and can't afford to slip forward as I am also disabled and use a stool to sit and cook, wash dishes, etc. If you have a ""normal sized backside"", it will be fine...I gave mine to my daughter..and that made her happy..so ""it's all good!' This was the Winsome Wood 24 inch swivel Seat Bar Stool from Amazon."
4,Good product,Easy assembly made for a good start. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable. Ordered two to see how they were but will probably get two more.
3,Arrived Broken and mounting bolts not threaded,"Ordered one stool. Middle slat was broken. The rest were ok. Mounting bolts were not threaded and looked like the bottom of the barrel bolts (the last ones in the lot) and I had to use my 3 of own nuts and bolts to mount. Other than that, everything is just fine."
2,Winsome wood 24 inch stool,"The chair was well constructed, but once you sit in it you will find that the back is too straight and will cause back pain, very disappointed returned all chairs"
1,"Michael Jackson, The Interview Collection","Honestly, Michael's one year anniversary of his passing is only a couple of weeks away and people are once again trying to cash in on his grieving fans!! Seriously, most fans have interviews of Michael on tape from years ago and we can relive them without making some one who is not contrbuting anything to Michael's children from the profits they would make from this DVD. Also, with no information about what it contains I will wait for it to be in Public Library where all these DVD's end up and see it for free!!"
5,good and bad,"This is a great season of a great show, many funny episodes.ProsSome of the best eps evergood qualityconsno extrasa little more costly than season 1One oddity I noticed, the last ep on disc 2(Cold Feet), starts with the normal theme song, and all that, the WTC is edited out of the opening as it is in all the episodes, but after the opening the actual episode begins. There's a night time skyline shot and the WTC is there. not a big deal, just something I saw."
5,Thanks,I have always enjoyed this show and I am more than happy to add it to my collection of videos.
1,"Love the show, hate the discs","I have tried two times now, and the second season just will not work on my DVD player. I can only play the first half of each disc. I can see shows 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the first disc, but I can't get to 5, 6, 7, and 8. And the same on the second and third discs. I am very disappointed, since my favorite episode, the one where Jamie registers to go to college, is on the inaccessible second half of the third disc."
5,Timeless Family Entertainment,"""Mad About You"" dvd's will brighten anyone's day. It was a wonderful series with many memorable characters and one very dumb, but loveable, dog. The dvd quality is excellent. Watch an entire season without commericals or interruption."
5,Excellent little book every parent should have!,"This book clearly explains why teaching 'real world' math first, before beginning the laborious process of writing abstract concepts, helps children to excel and creates a love of math. I wish I had this book years ago!"
3,well...,"ive been a fan of 40BS since 2000 and they ultimately impressed me with their heavy guitar sound led by max illidges incredible roars.when ""invitation to the dance"" came out, i loved the intensity, but on ""the mourning after"", once you get through with ""f.e. and ""taxi cab confessions"", the album slips into a mellowdrone state, trying too much to sound like something that would fit on the radio rather than being themselves.i think if they cans tay with their original heavy and driving sound, they would turn out to be much much better.i do like this labum, but it is disappointing to see them drown this album in melancholy tones.if you liked ""invitation to the dance"", you should enjoy this somewhat-for fans of lo pro, memento, and nonpoint."
5,"Great live show, great music, get this disc!","I saw these guys over the summer opening for Ill Nino and was totally unprepared for how amazing they were. They had the whole crowd singing along to every song, like Rope and others. I immediately got their first album and found out what I was missing. Then this album comes out and it's just as strong, even better in some ways than the first one. I can't wait to go see them again, but next time i'm sure they'll be the headliners. This band is about to blow up huge."
4,Pretty Good.,"The heroine, Kat Colorado, is interesting, brave, ethical, and has funny friends. If I want to lay low for an afternoon (or weekend) I love reading mysteries...and the Kijewski series is one of my five favorites. Copy Kat was good -- even with a bonus of a few lines of profundity."
3,Its smaller than it looks,"This is a nice looking waste basket sized ""trash can"". Seems to be well made and functional, but I didn't have a grasp of what size meant by gallons. If you're looking for a kitchen garbage pail you need something a lot larger."
4,Fantastic little thing,"I love this can! ( I have the white one)Pro:Arrived in perfect conditionSturdy buildlooks cute as garbage can possibly lookpedal is responsive, not flimsy or bendyCon:Slides around on the kitchen floor, needs rubberized bottom or something!"
5,Essential to RW fan,This is my favorite out of The Real World series of books. For starters I love the cover all the faces of each castmember through out the years in a collage. It goes into detailed info on Boston season which is my favorite cast. But the whole book goes further into detail on how the experience was for each castmember from NY to Boston. Tells how each one is dealing with life after their seasons long over with. Funny sections of little captioned squares asking them name 6 other people they would love to live with in The Real World. Also includes a funny little section on each castmembers take on certain words & if they consider Real World a soap opera or documentary. Vibrant colored pictures of the casts. Essential book to have for a RW fan.
1,Cheap = poor quality,"Save your money and buy a quality product!We thought we would try this rechargeable flashlight based on the positive review of others, we ordered 2, both were defective. On the first light, we used 1 minute of cranking that provided less than 15 seconds of lite, not 30 minutes. The LEDs are bright but look quick before they fade !!On the second, no amount of cranking would provide light. Guess we learned, buy cheap, get a cheap product.Save your money and buy a quality product!"
5,"Excellent Book, Very, Very Sad Ending","I can't express how upset I am at the ending of this. I knew it would come, but not so soon. A definate twist that I did not like. This particular book is heartwarming throughout (except the end) and has an excellent plot with a few new twists and a new character. I definately liked it, but as I mentioned, the ending was terrible. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. Althogh I am depressed about it's ending, the book was still fabulous!"
5,One of my favorites,Everyone says I'm a book worm and teases me because I read too much. I read the Choice in about one day. All the books are good in the series but this one is one of my three favorites of the series. The ending was sad and happy. I wish I could write about it because I liked it about the best but then I'd be giving the story away and everyone would know the ending. I like all the different things that happen in #9. I like Jimene and all the things she does to get to the end.
5,The Choice: What a Choice it was!,It was an amazing story with an amazing ending. I can't believe....well I don't want to ruin it but now I understand that there are really only supposed to be 4 daughters and not Five! I still can't believe who betrayed them all...I really can't!Anyway Read it and you'll see what i mean.-Zach
5,IT WAS WICKED AWESOME!!!!,"Jimena was great in this book how she stood up for her self, and faced her worse fears. She came across alot of obsticles she had to over come. She was haunted by old mistakes, and had a love to deal with. It was really cool how she protected her friends, and old enemies. I learned a lot from her. I loved this book, but when I got to the ending I was a little upset, and I recommend it to any Daughters of the Moon fan because in my opinoin it was the best of the series so far..."
3,The Choice,"Honestly, the book could of been better. I won't deny it, it was pretty good, but it could of had more details.(ie. finds the traitor, battles, then goes to something completely differently. totally bogus!) and some of it was interesting, but went to something different then it should be. (but i cant wait until September when ""The Talisman"" comes out to see what's up with Maggie and Penelope)"
5,WOW WOW WOW....,I LOVED THIS BOOK SOO MUCH!!!Jemena is my favorte Daughter of the Moon. the way she could go from Gang life to a Goddess wow. but this my be well for me it is the ending that i hate because she is no longer a Daughter of the Moon but in 10th book you undersand that she is going away just like that! but now i have said to much.So read this book because you will LOVE IT!!
1,Product never arrived,"I ordered this headcover from Golfbargins via amazon on March 16, 2004 and am still waiting to receive it over a month later. The service is absolutely terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,No source for information,"I bought this book for about $20, hoping to obtain useful information about ""Westsylvania"". What I got was moreso a history of the authors' ancestors. The original ""Memorial"" of the inhabitants requesting the formation of a new state is transcribed, but the source of that document is not stated anywhere in the volume. The fact of the matter is that the Memorial existed only in the papers of Judge Jasper Yeates, who, in 1776, was sent to Fort Pitt by the Continental Congress as the Commissioner on Indian Affairs. The authors include a list of all the inhabitants of the region of western Pennsylvania in 1776 under the assumption that they were all signers of the Memorial. A good portion of the book documents the authors' ancestors from this region during the Civil War - as if that has anything at all to do with the idea of ""Westsylvania"". The book is essentially a glorfication of the authors' ancestry with a little bit of 'history' added."
3,Good But Not Great,This is a good album and Interpol are a fantastic band. They have excelent melodies and I love the singers voice. I realy enjoy their lyrics. I bought this album because I loved the two singles off it slow hands and evil. Evil is a song kicked of buy a realy cool bass riff and then followed buy a fantastic melody. Slow Hands is good because of its fantastic lyrics and cool guitar parts. This album takes a bit of listening to before you start to like it. However the album has to many songs that need to be skipped also I find the songs all sound the same. The Album is certainly good and worth a listen but it isnt exactly fantastic.
1,Plastic Fantastic,"As far as albums for 2004 go, this is excellent,However by TOBL standards, it is less than appealing.The songs on antics are solid and well written, but lack the shear brilliance of TOBL, and this is not helped by the terrible mix, there's just no atmosphere in this album, the songs are good, infact as good as TOBL in places, but the mix is awfull. It sounds like it's been mixed by N'Sync, there's no instrument seperation, the drums are over polished and fake sounding while the guitars sound processed and stripped of any sonic character.If they had recorded Antics the same way they did TOBL, and dropped some of the cheesy 80's throw-back stylings, I might have really liked this album.How does a band go from TOBL to Antics? Sort it out lads. :("
1,like grodie to the max,"""Antics"" is grodie to the max. Like gag me with a spoon. This 80's stuff is about as cool as Max Headroom. Yep. Not very cool at all, huh? Well, in a few more months, people will see what a lame, trendy band Interpol is..."
1,"""Antics"" is slick","""Antics"" is a slick work of art. Unlike some, who reprimand Interpol for a lack of artistic merit, I feel they go too far. This is obviously the case of a bunch of pretentious artists, trying to pass off some slick minimalist jive. I can tell they're artists because they wear expensive designer suits and are always caught on camera in artistic poses.The songs all employ a similar 8th note riff on the guitars and monotonous drum patterns without fills or articulations. It's as if this is the statement of where music should be heading? This sort of uniform minimalism is indicative of the slick artist. It's almost like the slick composer who spends 2 hours tuning, and that was the performance!I would agree with the timeless remark, but as the band's own lyrics go ""I'm as timeless as a broken watch"". Indeed! Antics is as timeless as a broken Casio calculator watch that's stuck in 1982.I agree with ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". This is a slick work of art!"
1,Not timeless,"I recently bought ""Antics"" I found this album to be part of this new ""80's revival"" thing. The songs have the rigid poppy simplicity of 80's music. This means that when this whole fad is over, ""Antics"" isn't very valid anymore. I guess for some people, this may be OK, but when I pay money for a CD, I'd like to be able to listen to it for years to come. ""Antics"" unfortunately, was a poor choice. I would recommend the new Sleepytime Gorrilla Museum album, ""...Of Natural History"" if you're into timeless and artistic alternative music.I have no problem if Interpol were labelled a ""rock"" band. But they consistently get the ""alternative"" label, which is why I bought ""Antics"". Alternative means a different choice, but this is a rehash of 80's music here. There's nothing different here."
2,Slow Hand is quite similar!,"Yes... I bought this album, and when I read some of these posts, I went to the record store and bought the Joy Division ""Substance"" compilation. The song ""Slow Hand"" is very much like ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". The way they edit the sample on Amazon, you won't notice it, because its the 3 seconds of the song that is original.Lots of bands are not originiasl, but Interpop make me feel good. Who cane debut that?"
2,NEXT EXIT,"its a shame.'turn on the bright lights' was a really exciting, vigorous, and intense listen.sure it relied heavily on its influences (which im sure we are all aware of), but it was a debut, and a fantastic one at that, so we forgave them.unfortunately 'antics' is a real letdown.the songwriting is lazy and amateurish, the whole thing lacks the intensity and energy of the first album, the riffs are stale and all too familiar, and the lyrics are absolutely atrocious.a few examples maybe?'This could be destinyOh sweetheartI've had no sense of timeSince we started'or what about:'He speaks about travelYeah, we think about the landWe smile like all peopleFeeling real tan'and my favourite:'If time is a vessel, then learning to loveMight be my way back to sea'yep. its bad.Admittedly, it is interpol so its not AWFUL music.its just much less than they are capable of. it just doesnt grab you like 'TOTBL'.it really is incredibly dull."
1,too guitar-y,"This album is way too brainy and sophisticated or wahtever. The singer-guy thinks hes smart because he can sing and the guitars are too loud. I dont understand how people can like this album. Its too rock-y. If you want REAL music, go buy eiffel 65's ""europop""-its REALLY GOOD! Or go buy the new disturbed or uncle kracker- theyre my FAVES! I'm outie!"
1,"man, what a bummer",it's too bad interpol has moved away from their joy division influence..because i was really hoping they would hang themselves....
3,Decent album,"'Antics' is a good album, but it doesn't quite have the same emotional intensity as 'Turn on the Bright Lights', in my opinion. Part of this may be the music itself, but personally I feel that some of Paul Banks lyrics are less than thought-provoking on this album in several places as well, particularly on 'Next Exit' and 'Slow Hands'. With that said, there's still some very good tracks: 'Evil', 'Narc', and 'Not Even Jail' come to mind. But even those don't quite match up to the the dark and profound emotional intensity of 'Untitled', 'NYC', or 'PDA', again, in my opinion."
5,Interpol... So simple and soooo good.,"Well I love their retro style... Strange Lyrics, and all songs are great. Best songs: Length of Love, Evil, Slow Hands, Not Even Jail, Next Exit and C'mere"
4,"Agood listen that reminds one of ""Kitchens""","I am writing to tell you what a joy this album is. My brother got this for me along w/ Killers, Franz, Modest Mouse and other stuff. Heard a lot of the others before, but not this. It reminded me of a band I listened to back in 1990 called Kitchens of Distinction, specificlly ""Drive that Fast"" and ""Within the Daze of Passion.""That being said, this group is still a refreshing part of a wave of better music ranging from Badly Drawn Boy to Modest Mouse. It is just fun to perk up to good tunes whether they be poppish or introspective. Remember Talk Talk, Joy Division, Gene Loves Jezebel, Dead can Dance and Bel Canto... they are all gone! I miss those bands dearly. This new wave of tunes reminds me of those and other bands of years gone by, really good, fun bands."
3,Their act is growing tired.,"I gave TOTBL 4 stars, because I honestly thought it was a good album. The ambient sounds, the mood, atmosphere, tunes. It was all solid. Not brilliant, but solid. This album is just ok. They've removed a lot of the atmosphere and gone for a more poppy sound, which works on some songs, but leaves one with an entire album of choppy guitar chords and iffy lyrics when you come down to it. I'm not saying these guys should start shredding or anything, but it's time to start showing some growth on your instruments guys. That Television counter chop riff got really tired halfway through TOTBL, and is REALLY tired now. Learn something new. I let the monotonous instrumentation go a bit on the first album becuase there were other things to catch your attention...but not on this album. Time for some new ideas Interpol."
4,Fantastic,"I am an Interpol fan, and I like their sound. I love the style of their music, guitar driven and rythmic melodies. The vocals blend well with the style of music. Interpol is just a great band, and definitely worth checking out.I hate when they get compared to Joy Division. I find each band unique. Interpol's lyrics are eccentric, but really good. I really like both of their albums. I have enjoyed listening to Antics over and over. It does not, in the least, get tiresome. The whole album needs to be experienced as one. I find listening to one or two songs deviates from the perfection that encompasses Antics.I really think that if you like Interpol, even a little bit, this album is worth owning. It is a really excellent album. It is catchy, fun, and never tedious. I give it four stars. It is not a genius album, but wonderful anyway."
2,premature review,"i was hard on this release upon first listen, but, it does sound better after a few spins, i really do like ''narc'', ''c'mere'' and ''slow hands''"
1,pieced together in ProTools,"I bought ""Antics"" a few days ago, and after 2 listens, I decided to sell it used. This is not a very good album at all. Interpol do sound like Joy Division.In addition to being derivative, this band has no talent. I read a recent interview in a recording magazine, and they pieced all of this music together in ProTools, giving this work the illusion of talent. The music is pretty simple to play. I don't get why these guys can't just record an album properly. The ProTools recording sounds very sterile. Maybe instead of spending so much time on their appearance, this band should practice and write better music.I'd honestly rather listen to Supertramp than this crud!"
4,Perspective...,"The great Britt Daniel paid homage in some small way to Interpol by remixing ""Slow Hands"" for the single's release. His opinion is more relevant to me than that of any amateur critic who feigns importance by espousing rudimentary knowledge of guitar-playing (see a number of previous reviews).I love this album (as much as TOTBL). But give it a spin and be your own judge."
2,Don't buy it,"I really love Turn On The Bright Lights, and I still listen to it on a regular basis, but this album is pretty awful. I've only listened to it once all the way through, and I have no desire to hear it again. There just aren't any memorable or noteworthy songs on this. It almost sounds like they're trying too hard to shake the Joy Division comparisons, and in the meantime it sounds like they're just going through the motions. Save your money. Maybe they'll put out a better one next time..."
3,Pleasing but not great,"Having been blown away by the masterful ""Slow Hands"" which I heard on radio, I went out and bought the CD. If you accept that ""Slow Hands"" is the best song on the album, then the other songs can be heard as being pieces of that song. It's almost as if the band took the best ideas of the other songs on the album and put them together to ferment the ""slow hands"" masterpiece.Nevertheless, there are a few beautiful moments in the rest of the album that are worth a listen. Give it a try."
2,Vastly inferior to TOTBL,"Whilst TOTBL was definitely one of the best albums in recent times, i am astounded to read that interpol fans think Antics is anywhere near as good. Whilst Totbl has a wondeful variety of beautiful slow songs mixed with brilliant rock songs, Antics is a one dimensional album with the vast majority of songs so similar they blend into each other. The only exceptions to this are Evil, Slow hands and to a lesser extent, Not even jail. The beautiful chiming and the aching sorrow of TOTBL have been lost, only to be replaced by tuneless rubbish. Very dissapointing."
3,"Great watch, but I wish it had lasted longer","I got my first Vibralite 8 in May 2009, and I'll be ordering a new one today, since I depend on it so much in my job and my life in general. The vibrating alarms are indispensible, and I use the stopwatch and countdown timer frequently in my job. The problem for me is changing batteries. The first time, I wasn't able to use the top right button, the one that changes the time or starts the stopwatch after I reassembled the watch. It took a great deal of disassembling, playing around with the components, and reassembling before it would work again. Another year or so gone by, and the battery died again on Friday. I put in a new battery today, and, again, the top right button won't work. I messed with it and messed with it, and it still doesn't work.I'd give this watch five stars if I could manage not to break it every time I need to change the battery."
5,One of the best MCs Male or Female.,"I'm basing my review on the regular 6 tracks. Jean's production is tight as hell her rhymes are just as good. Don't be sexest and write her off because she is a women because she breaks through that steriotype. Im sure any MC would be more that proud to work with her. Track 5 is just about one of the illest songs I ever heard, and track 6 is dope too. She has a new CD out I wonder if its any good."
5,jean grae goddamn,the realest of the realest are not as real.... this is what hip hop is poetry this woman is amazing her rhymes are from the heart the production is amazing... wow
5,Jeanius strikes again,"As almost always, Jean delivers something flawless. I luv #6 in it's entirety, but wish the songs were seperated, I gotta scan through when I want to find a certain one. But all in all, I absolutely luv it."
4,Complete Digital Photography Book,"This is an excellent beginning and intermediate offering that uses actual photographs to demonstrate the effects of choosing various settings with digital photography. I would give it five stars if it included some additional charts or text information for exposure times and special photography conditions; weather effects night-time astro-photographic applications. It really is an excellent book though and I liked his comment, ""the idea is not to get the camera to take a picture but to make the camera take the picture you want."" Very good."
3,Decent mp3 player for cheap,"I got this at KMart on sale for roughly the same price as here. It's a 1Gb MP3 player for less than $20! What do you expect?The build quality is poor, the screen is tiny & not very bright, the ear buds are uncomfortable and sound awful.I have an old 256Mb player that was very nice once, but has become my player for the Gym, etc. Now for less than $20 I have a 1Gb player to fit the same role. I threw out the crappy ear buds and use my old ones that sound much better.You get what you pay for, and I didn't pay much for this."
4,Bounty by layer!,"This is one of the best compilation Cds in the ""Strictly the Best"" series. This Cd runs the gamut from Dancehall to traditional riddems'. ""Dude"" by Beenie Man with the sexy, sultry voice of Ms. Thing starts off this cd at a fast riddem' man. Next in line is the very popular ""All Out"" by Elephant Man. Get up and dance all out. Stand up and shout.Are you into remixes? Then the ""Get Busy Remix"" by Sean Paul ignites your inner self. This cut alone is worth having in your collection. Sizzla, Bounty Killer and the tra dich ""Smile"" by Junior Kelly will put on smile on any face.I've noticed stateside dancehall is marketed in compilations first. Then artist must gain the popular vote and get a solo album. Money and riches will follow. Do you sellout to gain popularity? Some say so, some same no. But who am I to talk?Get this Cd for your collection. Then indulge yourself with the artists themselves. Happy "" Hot in the club"" dancing."
2,I don't even have to listen to this CD...,"to know it's BS. There are more CD's released after Tupac's death than before his death, which I find somewhat pathetic. Just stick to listening to his older tracks and avoid remix crap like this. I also heard Suge (who authorized this crap to make money) was also involved in the murder of Notorious B.I.G (one of my favorite rappers), which I find disgraceful and horrendous."
2,Such a DAMN shame,As the others have stated and commented on this album. This album consists of classic Tupac songs with different beats and some different lyrics. Nothing to get all excited about! I purchased it simply because it is a Tupac album. I like to own original Tupac albums.R.I.P. Tupac
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!,"2 Pac is one of my favorite rap artists, but this wack @$$ CD... isn't even worth the time to go buy it or download it. I thought it would be just remixes, but the whole damn beat is something different, and they suck! It's a waste of money, and time. Keep the ""Klazzics"" how they are and don't f#?k with them!"
1,This a disgrace.,"Usually remix CDs feed of the momentum of 1 or 2 remixes that are better than the originals. This CD does not do that at all. I would rather buy another copy of the 7 day theory CD, and listen to CD with all good cuts. If you really like 2pac it might entertain you a bit, but all the songs are worse than the originals. I think the hit em up is decent because Pac actually throws some love to a few east coast guys. Other than that I don't recommend it."
1,WARNING: NU-MIXX not as good as ORIGINALS,"Sadly enough I agree with most of the people here. The NU-MIXX KLAZZICS are horrible. The only one worth playing out loud in your home stereo or car stereo is AMIBITIONZ AZ A RIDAH. The rest are so horrible, I can't even listen to them in their entireties. I recommend to everyone is, please download these songs and listen to them before you even think about buying the CD. Better yet just burn the MP3 versions off the Internet, but listen to them. Because most of these songs aren't even worth the computer space. Sad to say, I made the mistake of buying this first without prior knowledge thinking it would actually be good."
1,Dont Get It! (0 Stars!),"This is disrespectful to Tupac! Its a F****** Joke! Whoever gives this anything above 2 stars isnt a real Pac fan! They jus like Suge or Death Row! Suge was jus tryin to make money off Pac. But forget Suge, Suge is the reason why Pac is dead! If you dont believe me go watch the Move Biggie & Tupac! It tells it all. But the beats on this album dont go with Pacs rhymes and on top of that the beats is garbage! ITS A JOKE! Show Pac respect by not buyin it! They replaced snoop with Crooked I on ""2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" What kind of shhh is that???Any real Pac fan wont like this!"
5,Buy It ! You wont regret it,"Although at first this album sounds below par to the usual Tupac albums, after you listen to it for a while and starts to grow on you it sounds right up there with the great songs Pac made. All these people that say this is the worst 2Pac album and that its not worth buying, obviously havent given it a good listen. It takes a while to get used to listening to these new beats specially if your so used to the old original beats. If your a big Pac fan then you'll probably wont like it at firts, just because your used to listening to the originals. If your not that big of a fan then youll definately like this album instantly. Take my advice buy this cd, listen to it once or twice even if it sounds weird, and i guarantee you'll love it. Its well worth the money and a great addition to your collection. Best songs: Americaz Most Wanted, Toss it up, Never had a Friend Like Me and Ambitionz as a Ridah"
2,Worst Tupac Album,I own every tupac cd and this has to be by far the worst album out. This is just a way for death row to make a quick buck to pay off thier law suits. It is sad how much they have fallen from their past. The thing that makes this album so bad is the production on it. Death Row used to have the top producers in the game but now they are resorting to no names who are using beats from a video game. Plus they only put 10 tracks on there. All in all this is a bad mixtape and a disgrace to tupac. I would say only buy this album if you are a die hard tupac fan.
1,Wrong Item received.,I ordered this item for my daughter and I received something different. The cup I received leaks. I wanted this product for my daughter so she can start to use a big girl cup. I was disappointed.
3,Detective Dino,This book is just okay. One story is cute. The rest are not great. I wouldn't buy this book again.
2,gods? what gods?,"please note, this book is a thesis or something. It is not a book on lithuanian mythology. I thought this book would be equivalent to Mythologies but it only contained one full mythological story. the preface was good. but this book lacked all the essentials i thought were basic to the book. it was a study on the mythological parts of certain stories and how it fit the genre. it you are looking for a book on lithuanian mythology search again. if you are looking for a thesis paper on lithuania mythology, this is the item you NEED!"
3,They work,"They work but I wish I didn't need them. The distiller unit should come with a refillable metal filter piece that I can re-pack with either charcoal inserts, or pack with my own charcoal. Recurring revenue items like this always bugged me, just another little way to keep squeezing money of out people."
3,Works well,The Waterwise replacement fillers do the trick to keep my distiller producing clean water. I have an older distriller and had to take apart the replacement fillers and dump the charcoal into my old filter. It's messy and inconvenient but this replacement cup is way too large. I also think it's way too expensive for what you get. It's the closest I could come to getting a size that would fit though. The company that makes my filter went out of business and I can't seem to find a small enough filter.
1,Card doesn't work,"Just got this card for Christmas and my camera won't read it, even though it says it should work for my camera model. Cheap media, a complete waste of money. Can't send it back for refund because Dane-Elec considers this to be a ""consumable"" item and won't refund it unless the package is unopened. This card and company are a serious ripoff."
4,i have eaten this soup for years.,i have eaten this soup for years. it is convenient and has high fiber and high protein. my only complaint would be that i wish the sodium was a bit lower.
3,Shopper,"The product was listed as like new, it should have been rated good or fair. The door to insert the SD card was very loose. It didn't print anything at all on the first try. I had had one of these before so I knew how to do maintenance on it and I did get it working, but I had to use about half an ink cartridge to get it working. It is a good product, it just was not in like new condition."
5,Wonderful output directly from flash memory,"This is the way I want a photo printer to work.Works as advertised. It delivers beautiful output directly from camera flash memory cards, plus it prints nicely from a computer via USB. The color accuracy is the best I've ever achieved from any photo printer, especially when printing directly from flash memory. The inkjet cartridge lasts longer than the paper that comes with it, so having some extra Epson glossy photo paper will get you some extra prints.It doesn't read RAW files, I'd like to see that added in the next version.The color LCD display is fine, however I wouldn't mind closer zoom steps for cropping, sometimes the zoom in steps jump a little too much, so you end up compromising between too close or too far, same thing with the position of the crop frame, these are minor issues and wouldn't stop me from highly recommending this unit to anyone.Well done Epson!"
4,Convenient but expensive,"The quality of the prints are excellent when everything is working correctly, but I've never gotten anywhere near 100 prints out of a cartridge. There are many wasted pictures, because of cartridge clogging which causes lines in the print. Performing the print head cleaning will correct this, but it uses too much ink. I would estimate that the utility cleaning costs the equivalent of 10 pictures. I've had to perform this 2 to 3 times per cartridge during the course of a year of printing pictures. I can't determine whether more frequent use would lessen the clogging problem. I usually use a cartrige pack a year."
5,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!,"This product is incredible. I know photography, and I'm fussy about quality- these pictures honestly look like they were professionally developed. Plus, with the new color screen on the delux model, it is SO easy to look through your pictures and decide which to print. It's also incredibly easy to zoom in and crop the pictures before you print them! If you have a digital camera, you NEED this printer so that your pictures dont just sit in a folder on your computer, yet you dont have to go out to print them. A must buy!"
2,"A big fan, disappointed in this one","I'm a huge REK fan but this CD is the only one that has left me cold. I probably have overly high expectations based on how much I loved his previous CDs, but this one just didn't come close for me."
3,Quality does not match the name - TOMMY BAHAMA,"PRO: It's TOMMY BAHAMA,leather upper, leather lining, fashionable, $25 is good value.CON: Leather quality and craftsmanship may dissatisfy you. So, product quality is not guaranteed. I placed two orders and returned two items that are defective and not acceptable."
4,Excellent,excellent s-video cable for any price. Kinda doubted the quality because the cable is sorta thin but still works great!
5,Exactly what it should be.,"I bought this S-video cable for $0.01 + shipping. I was skeptical about the price but it arrived on time, was properly packed, and still works perfectly. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of an S-video cable."
2,Disappointed...,"They do not look like the picture....they are not cut out good and are not black..they come in a small box and are flattened out.We will have to spray paint them black to look correct (they are way to gray looking) and will have to try to figure out how to get them halfway blown up to look correct... Very disappointed in this product..I have only had a few issues with products I have bought on Amazon, but this one is bad..."
3,Not bad,"The level of technology has gone up a notch from the original TV series. For example : Warp 11 and Kirk's brain implant. Seems to me that you would test the monitors before hooking them up to the Enterprise where they can take over. Spock asked if the Monitors could be taken off line and the specialist did not know. Spock and Jim seem off a bit.Save for those few elements mentioned above, I rather enjoyed reading the book."
4,Nothing I regret,"Regret is about growing up and doing less drugs, neither of which helped New Order produce some of the best indie-pop-dance-rock tracks of the 80s and 90s. After all, the outstanding guitar work on Brotherhood isn't physically possible without speed.Nevertheless, Regret is classic New Order. A skillful blend of rock and dance, thoughtful lyrics and Hookie's outstanding bass work. Singer Bernard Sumner sounds, well, _relaxed_ and almost grateful for the chance to 'fess up.It's not up there with the classics, which is why I only give it four stars, but if you've never heard New Order before, this would be an excellent place to start."
3,Good Only If You Entertain Sentimental Memories....,"....I like a good tune as well as anyone. And like many folks I was so glad to see MJ perform as a kid, I wanted to be like him. Hell, a lot of us wanted to be HIM. I, for one, had grown out of that, long, long ago....I've become fixated on my own wife and kids. I can be sentimental about them.But, the issue at hand is what I feel about this MJ CD.Michael's Motown cuts here are just ""alright"". Nothing good, nothing bad. ""Got to Be There"" and ""Ben"" in particular are good tunes. But until someone makes an all encompassing anthology which includes MJ's solo Motown and Epic years, this will probably only whet your MJ jones. It ain't--noways, nohows--the best thing smokin' though. Unless you take the view that when certain artists sneeze, it should be considered a masterpiece. I say, ""Let the buyer beware"" on this one..."
2,They don't stick!,"These are very nice looking and are very comfortable, but they don't stay on long. So I give it two stars because what good is it if it's going to fall off?"
1,Horrible,Absolutely ruined the day after Christmas because: a. It took that long to figure how to program the game and 2. Half or more of the buttons didn't work.Definitely not worth a tenth of the price.
5,BUY IT!,"Beres Hammond, Beres Hammond, Beres Hammond. He is the greatest smoothest romantic voice I have heard in a while. For sure their ""ain't nothing like good all dance hall vibes"" his music is definetly as sweet as wine. It's weird that i had no idea who had sang some of my favorite reggae love songs because most were in compilation CD's that friends had given me. When I actually did a little research to find out who actually sang the songs, I found out that most of them were by Mr.Beres. For that reason, I went out and bought ""can't stop a man, the best of"" I absolutely loved the CD. It makes you want to cry and smile and if you are in love, it makes you fall even furthur. EVEN BETTER it sometimes can do all the talking for you. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS BUY IT!"
1,Save your money,This is a piece of junk. Blade lights up when you flick the switch but the sound effects come on immediately after you place the batteries in and won't go off until you take them out! The saber sound fx are also very light and not satisfactory. I'm sending this back as soon as possible.
5,Collectable of the Collectables,"I have a few lightsaber replicas and I enjoy putting them on display but never really could do much with them. I ordered this lightsaber and I must say that this is the best replica I have seen so far. It is an interactive replica that lets you do something with and makes you feel like a Jedi. From the polished metal hilt to the EL blade to the sound effects. Everything is great about it. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will love this. I liked it so much, I decided to order another one, yes that is true, it came yesterday. If you are tired of playing with those toy lightsabers for kids that have the flashing lightbulbs and the sound effects that don't sound like a lightsaber, order this one. You'll love it, I promise!"
2,Yawn.,"Maybe this is a better book for those who have read the others. But let's look at the problems I had with it:- I was able to figure out the identity of the shooter and the Ferryman very early on.- Having lived in Toronto for 10+ years, I wasn't that impressed by the specifics. OK but nothing special.- By the end I grew tired of Matt West as the author's ""ah, but what I haven't told you is .."" device.- The ending seemed a bit facile, especially in tying off a few loose ends - but explaining would be spoilering so I won't.- The paperback edition I read had more tha a few errors (""softwear"" for example)."
5,Love It!!!,Great collection of Eagles songs. Great buy! I have been wanting this for a long time now and I'm glad to finally have it as part of my collection. I highly recommend it!
5,This is the Best Best of I've Ever Heard,The Eagles who are an incredible band as it is have done it again by releasing this album. The first Cd which contains their best known classics does not let you down at any point wotht the songsflowing into one another. The second CD is almost as good but contains their more experimental stuff and therefore less appealing to this reviewer. I highly recommend buying it with the bonus DVD as it is a nice extra feature.
4,Good combination of the hits,Awesome album for Eagles fans. This 2 disc set has all of their greatest hits.
1,An Attempt at a Guiness Book of World Records ??,"I used to consider myself an Eagles fan. How many greatest hits albums can a group in good conscience do? What is the point of this? They surely don't need the money? Here's another best of ""...and my Lord & Saviour, people bought 'em"" (with apologies to ""The Last Resort"")"
1,save a few rock songs this band sucks,"Eagles suck in the rock world, they have a couple of rock songs but they are rock band......listen to hole in the world and you will agree. They sould like nsync...."
1,at the most 1 star ugh??,This intrepid cd is made out of lazy crowdrock of former glory.Can 'Hew' be serious???0000 stars eggdually.T-spoon Crockett
3,Incomplete,"Some reviewers have said that this is the only Eagles album you will ever need. That's just wrong. Where is TRYIN' or TRAIN LEAVES HERE THIS MORNIN' or OUTLAW MAN or TAKE THE DEVIL or TWENTY-ONE or....well, you get the idea. What is included are the dregs like HOLE IN THE WORLD and IN THE CITY and I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY. And where on earth is TRY AND LOVE AGAIN, for pete's sake?? Good heavens, this is wrong. I'll bet Henley and Frey would've excluded anything by Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner if they could get away with it. Jeez, the pettiness of these guys."
5,Cool gift,"My seven-year-old received this for a birthday gift. The only negative comment I have is that the motion alarm is annoying, but my son loves it!"
4,kool toy,This toy is cool i just but and its alot of fun the scope really does zoom and the flash light is really bright some of you might wonder what the bendy green hook like things is well it plugs into the flashight so you can write in the dark. The sensor is really sensitive but its cool. The only reason i gave it a 4 stars is because writing with the pen is hard because its heavy other than that buy it you won't be dissaponted.
4,Horrifying Tale!!,"Stephen King can put one over the edge but Dan Skelton takes you there and lets you fall! Dan brings one face-to-face with evil and you pray for the grace to overcome it! After finishing the novel and setting it down, I was able to finally breathe again! BOOJUM is reminiscent of THE EXORCIST, evil slowly creeping up and overtaking your whole being. The saving grace - a little child!"
4,Great for its price,"The headphones sound great and the microphone works pretty well. The headphone adjust mechanism will sometimes catch onto hair and the volume control is nonintuitive(turn wheel down to increase volume), but these are minor issues. Another temporary problem is the slightly nauseating plastic smell that comes with the new product. I expect that it will fade over time. Overall, very pleased."
4,Good Book for the color challenged.,"This book is simple and easy to understand. The authors wrote it in such a way that even the most color challenged quilter can figure out how to use a color wheel in determining what colors work well together. Lots of photo combinations of quilt patterns using different color harmonies so you have something to compare to. By explaining the color combinations as harmonies they take confusion out of all the art of color technical talk, even though they do use that to as a limited explination.If you're like me and find it difficult to understand how to pick out colors that look good together this is a tool for learning the concept without being in over your head."
5,Finally some of the great original Alvin on DVD,"I grew up with the original Alvin and the Chipmunks. I have been looking and waiting for years for these to finally come out on DVD. I truly hope that all of the original shows are released on DVD. If you ever liked the original Chipminks, you will NOT be disappointed with thi DVD."
2,Why just one?,"I love The Alvin Show! I want this DVD very much, but I will wait until a box set of ALL 26 shows are available. Yes, I would spend almost any amount to get it.( A box set). I can't justify $14.99 for this disc! I do not think it is fair, in my opinion, to put one classic cartoon on the disc and then fill it up with other animation from the 70's, 80's or 90's. We are the baby boomer who really like this show from the 60's. Please give us what we want at a fair price without the Chippetts, Achy Breaky Heart (or whatever). The (ORIGIONAL)Alvin Show featuring 2 shorts, Clyde Crashcup and a sing-a-long would be just fine. I don't want to sound like a snob, but please just give us the good stuff, the stuff that we over 40 years old would like."
4,Very Simple Great for first-time info,"This book is great for first time information on hypoglycemia. I wanted more information on what to eat and not to eat, BUT it did give me alot of information on some other things i did not know. Recommended if you don't know anything about it."
3,A book for the novice rider,"I have read quite a bit of Ms. Hill's books and have found them very helpful. However, I was a little disappointed in this book. It is geared for a beginner and isn't very useful for the more experienced rider who needs improvement. She had a few useful points here and there but I felt like I was reading a motivational and/or human anatomy book. I would recommend Swift's Centered Riding as a wonderful source instead."
3,Convenient but not accurate,"Bleed and short hose are convenient but gauge was off by >5 PSI. After disassembling and adjusting needle now reads correct but disappointing to have to repair. And yea, the rubber smells bad - removing rubber case and washing in soapy water minimized smell."
2,after the 3rd use it will not hold the pressure reading,the problem is... after the 3rd use it will not hold the pressure reading... thats sucks! still can use it but not very well.
1,Stopped holding pressure reading before long,"Felt solidly built enough when it first arrived. Unfortunately, it started failing after only a dozen or so uses. Loses pressure as soon as it's taken off the tire, which is unhelpful."
2,bad day,"Stoller, one of the great architectural photographers of all time, is shown here in what must arguably be his weakest offering. And Cartier Bresson, the hero of The Decisive Moment, contributed the most embarrassing production of his career. Too bad, because those old Galveston properties are really quite remarkable and unique."
2,Galveston that was,I expected to see pictures of Galveston as it was . This is a bunch of pictures of Galveston decayed.
5,THE book on rhe Mi-24 Hind,"As a former U.S. tanker, we feared these Soviet helicopters. So did the Afganhi's during the 1980's. Yefim Gordon shows why tracing the history & development of the Mi-24 Attack Helicopter from 1966-2001.This book has it all - excellent narrative, photographs in B&W; and in color, line drawings, interior photos, data you name it, you can find it here. It's also a hardback, unlike Gordon's Aerofax works. Every model is covered, as well as every nation that has used the Hind.The author is honest, telling the good and the bad of the Hind (or ""Crocodile"" as it was called by the Mujahideen). The Soviets studied American helicopter use in Vietnam and decided an assualt helicopter was a good idea, but unlike any other nation, they built in troop carry capabilities. Anyone interested in aviation,especially helicopters, will enjoy this book. It's a bit pricey for a modeler, but worth every penny. Highly recommended."
1,HOOOOOOOOOORIBLE,"First off, i hate the fact that stupid idiot fans of bands, come on here and give every cd of their fav. bands a 5 star rating. Which is idotic. 5 star rating..means classic, well to me it does. Ok? so please stop giving them out like their normal. Anyways to this crappy cd. My little cousin, bought this cd and i heard it while i was at his house. Their 2 previous cd were just as horrible. They're lyrics are plain stupid and their image is childish. People who like this cd, obviously dont care for good lyrics and good musicianship. Skip on this cd if you have any sense."
5,Rocks the Planet!,"I love every song on this CD. In fact, I like each song so much, I want to play it over again, but then the next song starts and I like THAT one so well, I have to let it go on. Evolved some from the earlier CD's with a wider variety of music -- some is super heavy and some is not, but shows the greater range of the artist. Fell in love with Dope after this CD -- telling everyone I know about them. BUY THIS"
3,Don't expect a Happy ending.,As a loyal life-long cubs fan who loves reading about his favorite team I have to say I was mildly disappointed in this book. The author did a good job in recreating the games but I felt that he lacked real access to the team. The quotes used in the book were all out of the newspaper or the internet. I wanted more substance. More behind the scenes stuff. There was plenty of drama off the field last year and it just seemed like the author glossed over it all. There were a few well written profiles included in the book. My favorite was about an elderly female fan who really loved the cubbies and went to as many games as she could despite her various maladies. I think Mr. Wagner made a bold choice in writing the book as the season unfolded as opposed to writing the book when the season was over. I just wish there had a been a happier ending.
5,"Oldish, but still good value for money","I bought this book knowing that it is an old edition, because I have an old PC (1998) and don't think that the second edition's CD-ROM would work on my ancient machine. For my purposes it is an excellent book. It teaches you the basics of game making, focusing on 2D game creation, mainly via the wonderful The Games Factory software which is really value for money. If you want to get to know The Games Factory well, this is the book for you. The explanations are clear and well written. I can heartily recommend this book and CD-ROM if you want to play around, learning and making your first games. But it is probably not suitable for the serious games maker."
1,less than 1 month and broke!,I got this toy for my niece who is one. It was great at first but in less than one month it broke. She also bought her 4 other v-tech toys for Christmas 50 dollars each they also have broke. BS.
1,Vtech toys contain BPA and PVC,"I am posting this around other Vtech toys because there are so many!!!: I just received a response from the company that to me is subpar given that these toys are in the mouths and hands of babies and children and contain BPA and PVC. I've read the research on both materials and conclude that I don't want my child to be exposed to either, especially on a daily basis. As these items are made in China and not rigorously tested, I am afraid to know what goes under the radar. I also feel this glut of cheap, plastic material is not good for the earth."
5,Made it through two kids and still looks new,"They both played with this toy daily! I love that you can take the main part off so that little ones can Play with it for tummy time. Provides hours of entrainment. Only downside is when the batteries start getting low, pushing the cows makes a weird repetitive noise! Great item otherwise!"
3,Nice.. while it lasts!,"I bought this toy in Sept 2012 for my twins 1st birthday. My kids (my son in particular) absolutely LOVED it. They love pushing the buttons and zooming up and down the hallway with it.. Unfortunately, here we are in Nov 2012 and it's already malfunctioning. The sounds come out sounding like static and the rooster sound plays constantly no matter what other button my kids press. This would be a great toy, if I hadn't spent $35 for a mere 2-3 months of use."
5,Great buy!,"My daughter loves this thing! She didn't really use it when she was learning to walk, but now that she is up walking & running around she loves to push & pull it all over the place."
3,TOO LOUD,"This toy does it's job - it walks well on our hardwood floors, but my daughter has to really push it if we are outside in the yard on short grass. The ONLY issue I have with this toy is that there are two settings for volume, low and high, and the low is way too loud. I tried to put tape over it, but of course that's just another thing for my daughter to try to play with since the speaker is on the front panel. If anyone who has this toy has figured out a way to lower the volume, please let me know!"
4,fun but loud,"Fun little toy my daughter has had it for 1-1/2 years and still play's with it.the phone will most likely get lost many times as it is not attached, and it is way to loud.Very durable both me and my wife have tripped over it and it still looks like new.One word of warning keep fresh battery's on hand if they get low it will start making noise for no reason, even if no one has been touching it for hours.As for education it is up to the parents to play with the children to help them learn the toy is not going to do it for you."
5,One of the best toys we own!,"Our 10 month old was pulling up on everything and loved to walk while holding our hands. We bought this toy to give him some independence with walking. He used it right out of the box - no need for him to get used to it - he got behind it and walked. He laughed and giggled and stared at his moving feet! The toy arrived on September 1st. On September 11th he took his first steps! This toy definitely sped up his confidence and balance when walking. As far as being a toy, he loves the peek-a-boo barn door, he LOVES the telephone, although it comes off the toy and is misplaced often during the day. He spins the bottom, he spins the cogs. The maker of this toy knows what kids like to do! He is very entertained by all aspects of this toy, and as parents we are so excited it accelerated his confidence in walking alone. Amazing!"
1,We got a bad one!,"I'm sure this didn't happen in every situation but the walker that we got was defective. It was turned on when we received it on the doorstep. I don't know if that was where things went wrong or not. It would work for a few seconds and then the rooster would go off over and over. We could never get it to work so we had to return it. When I tried to exchange it, there weren't anymore left. :("
2,Toys DO not Work!,"I purchased this walker for my son and it never worked right from the beginning. The sound on it was really muffled and he couldn't hear it. Within 2 weeks the toys on it quit working altogether. My sister-in-law also bought this walker and she did not have the same sound problem with hers, so I thought maybe I just got a bad one. However after a month or so all of her toys also quit playing sound! New batteries did not help. My son did have a lot of fun pushing it around, but I could have bought a cheaper one if that was all that it was going to be good for."
1,Item should be RECALLED!,"We bought this for our son about 2 months ago and I am very disappointed with he product, the removable toy comes off to easily badly engineered, when the toy comes off then the product is to light and often flips over often, my son was just using in now in front of me and again that stupid toy came off on the front lodged itself under the front and the toy flipped over and my son just did a face plant on to the floor. I'm ditching the toy and throwing it into the closet, the educational part that always comes off he can keep but i'm going to write a formal letter to the company asking that they recall this product until further safety issue are resolved. It needs to be designed better that it doesn't just fall off all the time. AVOID!"
4,S. Toy,My daughter loves it and is starting to take steps and hold on to it. it keeps her busy because she is super active.
5,What a perfect walker!,I have 11 mo old triplets who are trying to walk & this toy was PERFECT. I bought it b/c it was one of the highest rated on Amazon (this and the Fisher Price grocery cart - I bought both) and I really wanted to help the kids get around the playroom. They love playing with the buttons & items on the front and the boys LOVE running around the room pushing it. I have foam floor tiles down in our play room & it doesn't go to fast & it's only come over once & that's when it was intentionally pulled. Highly recommend for learning walkers.
4,Didn't last more than a year,"We purchased this toy at Target a year ago for our then 1 year old twins. It was a big hit with the girls and the triplets that I babysit. Unfortunately, the sounds/music quit working not even 6 months later. The lights still flashed but that kinda stunk considering how much we invested in it. I could have tried to return it, but didn't want to hassle with it. It got sold for a couple bucks at our yard sale. Very disappointing. :("
3,I didn't realize I would have to put it together.,having to put it together is a little lame but I understand why they do that. i didn't count the pieces but it seems to be 6 or 7.
5,Awesome to the MAX!,"A little bit of too much going on, but my 9 months old daughter enjoys for a long time and so did children from our church group from 8 months to 4 years old. Very popular!!! One of the best toys that I got for my daughter."
4,Highly Recommended,"Our son really loves this toy and has used it repeatedly since he was 7mo and he is almost 1yr now. He loves the ""peek-a-boo"" door and the phone and enjoys pulling the shapes out at the top (and I love that they are attached by small cords, so no missing pieces to worry about). My only complaint is that there is no mechanism for temporarily locking the wheels. So when my son is sitting down to play with the panel, we have to make sure that the walker rests up against a wall or couch, otherwise as he plays with it, the entire unit keeps pushing further away from him. You do have the option of removing the panel and placing it on the ground, but it is easier for him to reach all of the gadgets when it is upright. The sounds are quite busy and can sometimes be annoying, but I think that can be said for just about any baby toy with sound effects."
4,V-tec,"My baby likes it but not her favorite toy. I tend to play with her. She tries to put the square, triangle and circle pieces in her mouth but the strings aren't long enought and she get frustrated. My baby is 7 and 1/2 months."
3,decent,"I bought this toy in hopes that it'll help my daughter learn how to walk and play with the different stuff on the toy. Well this toy sorta does its job. However the panel on the toy is very weak and it falls off easily. Besides the weakness and the sturdiness of the panel, my daughter does use it and walk with it. So as a walker it does it's job but as a toy it's weak."
2,Not very baby friendly,"I bought this for my 1 yr old for Christmas to help her learn how to walk. All of the noises and lights and sounds intrigued her. She's never gentle with any of her toys, but what baby is? After only 2 months of use, the activity party of the walker no longer functions. This is very disappointing as she loved this walker. It is definitely not worth the money (as I am now learning)."
3,"Good toy, no walker helper","I bought this for my 10 months baby. He likes the music, lights and sounds, but this toy does not give the support for a pre-walker. Other minus is that to hear the animals sounds you have to press many times the key. For a little boy it would be more atractive to press the key and hear the animal immediatly"
3,Grandmother,"I bought this for my 1 year old grandmother and her 3 year old brother plays with it more than she does. I thought you could lock it in place so the child could play with it while it was in one place. But alas, I haven't gotten it to lock."
5,*thumbs up*,"loved it, more than i bargained for. such a great gift for any baby, my daughter's in love with it"
4,He's Back,"Man, it has been a while since Najee did anything and I am glad he is back. No he is not John Coltrane but he is not Kenny G either. With that being said, Embrace is just like I thought it would be: some bouncy funky tunes like Mali's Bounce, Sunshine Sometimes Rain and Vibin' with Ayers, some smooth jams like Eye 2 Eye and La Smooth (a tribute to the late great Grover Washington Jr.), and a lil Latin flavor - Movimientos with Sheila E's dad, Pete Escovedo, which also demonstrates his versatility playing the flute. I give it four stars for he still shows that he has it and when you think about it, the other smooth jazz stars such as Boney James, Jimmy Sommers, and Dave Koz owe Najee a great deal of honor and respect for it was Naj who first started using R&B singers to sing on smooth jazz records (showing my age) when it was still being called fusion back in the 80's. Right on Najee, you still sound good."
4,Brazilian Gods !!!!!!,i dont know about boring dude. Maybe cuz the guitars arent as lame as ur 2 cent bands..anyways...this album was a killer one..i just got it and it was everything i thought it was. Just Incredible.I Just wished it was a bit longer but its all good. This band blows Sepultura and Soulfy out of the water..KRISIUN !!!!!!!!
1,flimsy controls diminish an otherwise competent radio,The volume and tuning knobs felt flimsy to me and sure enough the tuning knob has failed after 2 years of light use. I certainly can't recommend this radio.
2,Save Your Money,"I purchased this radio based on this site's user reviews. Not so much for its sound - although ""OK"", I found it significantly bass heavy and the lack of a tone control frustrated any remedial attempt - but for the ""raves"" about its ability to pull in weak stations. I live in a fringe area. Until now I tolerated the marginal reception of my cheap Panasonic clock radio. I was looking forward to significant improvement with the B.A. No such luck! The FM reception is just as bad! In fact, the AM reception is worse! I received one AM LOCAL station, and that one was ""fuzzy"". If I didn't get that station, I would have thought the radio was defective! I think all those ""raves"" are from B.A. employees. The joke's on me. Take my word for it,save your money, buy a cheap Panasonic!"
3,its allright,"has about 3 good songs, the rest are not my style but o.k. 2 1/2 stars or mic's. that it"
5,The best mixtape of the year,"Dead Prez keeps the gems coming on this second mixtape Get Free Or Die Trying. While these other guys' mixtapes are all about guns, drugs and whose breath smells like badunkadunk, Dead Prez continues to give you socially and politically conscious rhymes. Standout Tracks: F*** THE LAW, COMING OF AGE, TALLAHASSEE DAYS, SCARED TO DIE(free Askari X), BABYFACE(dude killed it!), WHEN MAMMA CRIES, WINDOW TO MY SOUL(Stic dedicates this one to his dope fiend brother), LAST DAYS RELOADED(killer collabo with Onyx), REAL BLACK GIRL(the beat is hypnotizing)and O.G.(Original Garvey). Filler: Out in the world(sounds like circus music)and Paper Paper(too short to be enjoyed). Bottom Line: Get Free Or Die Trying is a great follow up to Turn Off The Radio. Unlike the first one they dont borrow anybody's beat they use their own beats plus the production is tight. I strongly recommend this mixtape for anybody who wants a break from the norm."
1,50 cent rip off,"dis is such a 50 cent rip off. and u want proof of it right? jus look at tha title. 50 centz cd is called get rich or dye tryin but this is get free or diee tryin. LOL. this cd is dum too. no good songs like if i cant, high all the time, wanksta, in da club which is da best song ever, and the new g unit song rox too its called stunt 101. so get da real stuff that is 50 cent! and get g unit 2! stunt 101 rox!"
3,"Not a classic, but good Dead Prez.","I loved ""Coming of Age"" off of this album. This was a very much over looked track. Also, ""Last Days"" was a very strong piece. Otherwise, this was not their best work. I am a true DP fan, and I'm looking forward to ""Rbg"". lfp."
2,"Bargain priced, but no text. Very basic.","First of all: this book is a bargain. At under ten bucks, you can get maps of world history to refer to. However, there are a few problems: (1) The book offers no text to explain history. So you really need to know the history yourself or have companion books to help; (2) the book emphasizes European state history, and shortchanges other nations, cultural changes, religious movements, migrations, slavery, technologies, etc. This is mostly a book of maps showing the changing territories of nations. //// I was hoping to assign this book to my college Geography students, but will not, nor do I have much use for it myself. I much prefer the other Hammond world historical atlas, even at the higher cost. Most of the new, larger world historical atlasses are superior, becuase they show that history is so much more than states. In sum, this book is a disappointment, useful to a very limited audience."
4,Decent world atlas of history,This book would make an ideal reference book if you want to look at a particular historical period at a glance and need a better idea of the national and imperial borders. This book however does not contain any historical analysis and assumes the user will do their own research or know the history that corresponds to the maps. I have seen better atlases of this kind but it is sufficient for reference. A good book to buy is The Times History of Europe Atlas if you are interested in Europe specifically. The ISBN for that book is 0-00-713161-5.
2,it won't stick,"I bought the gummi rail cover because my daughter was chewing on her crib. It would have worked if the product would stick to the crib. I don't know if it wouldn't stick because it had already been chewed on but the side that I really needed it to stick on (the inside)the whole thing peeled up. I kept heating it up with a hair dryer like the instructions said to get it to restick, but it wouldn't work. You are probably better off with something that clips on."
2,OK ONLY FOR CHEAP CRIBS,"I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH A 3-1 CRIB. FIRST AS SOME REVIEWS STATE BABIES CAN UNADHERE THE PRODUCT. WELL FOR SOMEONE WHO BOUGHT A CRIB TO LAST THEIR CHILD FOR MANY MANY YEARS, SUPER GLUING THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AN OPTION. SECONDILY IF YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT CHEWS ON MORE THEN JUST THE FRONT RAIL, THEN CUTTING THIS PRODUCT TO FIT THE SIDES LEAVES YOU WITH 1 PIECE TOO SHORT. IT CERTAINLY IS A GREAT IDEA BUT NOT PRACTICAL FOR MORE THEN CHEAP CRIBS."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I bought this at Babies R Us and it was a WASTE of money! I will never buy this product again, or recommend it to a friend."
3,Not the greatest,"I bought this because I thought it was a good idea and had some pretty good reviews. But after a few days my son was able to lift it. He only has bottom teeth and when he chews the bottom teeth lift the railing. I am going to try the crazy glue like one person suggested and see how that goes. If not, I have to find something else."
1,Might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail,"You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice."
2,Not impressed,"I followed the instructions for putting this on the crib. My son had it pulled off in one day. I have tried numerous times to get it to stick back on, with no success. It's very frustrating and was a waste of money at this point."
2,Doesn't stay on the crib rail,"In theory this product would have been great,but it doesn't stay on the crib rail. I followed the directions to a ""t"" and it was on the floor by the time my son woke from his nap. I also want to add that I tried to contact Kidkusion's customer service on two different occasions in order to try to get a replacement, or more information about how to make it stick, and did not hear back from them either time."
1,Removes crib finish,This is a horrible product. It will remove the finish off the crib. Now my dark cherry crib is missing the finish on three sides. I'M NOT HAPPY!!!
1,You might as well throw your money away,"Bought several of these, I followed the instructions but they wouldn't stay in place for more than 12 hours. Terrible product, DO NOT BUY."
1,HORRIBLE CONDITION,"I bought this brand new and when I received it, it looked like it had been used!! It wouldn't stick to my sons crib at all! It seriously looked like somebody else used it before I received it.It would have worked if it wasn't in such bad shape and if the sticky part on the back was properly covered. very disappointed and a waste of money!!! On top of I called the seller and left several messages and have yet to receive a phone call... This item is trash as far as I'm concerned... Atleast from this seller"
1,terrible,this gummi crib rail ruins the crib. i bought a very expensive crib and upon placing this rubber on the crib rail the adhesive pulled off paint. do not try this unless you have a plastic crib.
1,Doesn't stay stuck!,We bought this since our son has ruined his rail with teeth marks. It stayed stuck until I pulled the crib mattress out to change the sheets. Now it won't stick back down even with heat. What a waste!
2,Blue Moon,"Being a dedicated LuAnne Rice reader, this was by far my least favorite of her work. (I own all but her 2 earliest books and have enjoyed each of them.) Blue Moon appears to me to be her attempt to attract a broader range of readers, including those who are looking for more sexual content in their books. Having nothing against sexuality in literature, I just wish Luanne would stick with what she does best and leave the erotica to those authors who are known for that type of work. The sexual scenes involving the 2 teenage girls as well as some of the language used to describe a few of the intimate moments between Cass and Billy were disappointing. I was not only disappointed with the borderline vulgarity, but also felt it distracted from what could have been one of her better stories. In her efforts to include the sexual content, a few of the characters who had so much potential with LuAnne's talent, were just left to die on the vine. I hope this is not an example of LuAnne's ""New Look""."
1,I was very disappointed in this book.,I loved Luanne Rice's book Home Fires. This was nothing like it. I felt the writing was very disjointed and not believeable. I did finish it and felt some emotions for the characters but would not recommend it.
1,Why would they mess up a Christmas movie with swearing?,We are pretty conservative in what we watch and I thought a Christmas movie would be safe - especially with a G rating. But there was at least one curse word in this movie - so we didn't get to watch the rest. Our rule is - if there is swearing - off it goes. Just wanted to warn any others if you are cautious of what you watch. How sad that what could have been a good family video had to be messed up with foul language.
3,Comments on this gable vent.,"I ordered two of these 18 inch diameter gable vents. I was surprised they were tan in color as the picture showed white and I was not given a choice of color. The description should tell the color. I will paint it white but that is extra effort.The cover just presses on to the rectangular frame. I hope this is secure as I live in hurricane country in Baton Rouge, LA. The frame does have a screen to keep out insects.I was pleased with shipment as I ordered on Thursday and received the following Tuesday, with Monday being a Holiday.Charlie"
5,Cheaper than local options,Just what was needed most stores in town were either to high or just did not have the length we needed
4,Happy so far...,This is exactly what I needed to watch TV from my PC. But now I need cables for sound at this length.
3,"Ok, but I like Mach 3 Better","The Sensor 3 feels too stiff when you're shaving and doesn't seem to get very close. It's ok, better than several other brands, but I still like Mach 3 the best."
1,Junk,"I bought four of these pieces of crap 6"" pheumatic casters in January for a small service cart. Within six months the tires had split around the circunferance and fallen off the wheel. I don't know if it's worth replacing the tires."
5,long shadow,"This is a must for anyone. i would say something to Strummer fans, but those who are would already have this. for those who are not, this album is a reflection of the sounds strummer was a fan of - jamaican roots, rockabilly, brit punk, etc. get it, just get it, if you don't don't like it, listen to it a few more times. joe, johnny wasn't the only one who cast a long shadow."
2,Fine For Light Use,"The Holloway cordless sweeper is fine for light jobs (on a floor to pick up hair or dust). The handle is flimsy, bends when using, not sturdy or tall enough. For the cost, the quality is ok. To work properly near edges, the handle needs to be straight up. If purchasing again, I would buy a little more expensive product and better quality. I like the Holloway products very much, they missed the mark on the sweeper. Thank you."
2,"The brushes spin outward and blow dust, etc away from the deviice.","Why would they (the manufacture) not have the brushes rotate inward instead of outward they way the do and actually pick up the stuff of the laminate / and other floors? Having the brushes roll outward blows dust bunnies, etc away from the sweeper! I will NOT recommend this to others! It may be inexpensive, but it it definitely NOT worth it!! If I could get my money back I would and buy a (much) more expensive SHARK sweeper or the like!Holloway House 1275-00001A Quick Shine Cordless Glide Sweeper"
2,Not Good on Hard Surfaces,"This item does not work well on tile or laminate floors. It leaves a lot of dirt on the floor, especially pet hair. It also redeposit's hair back on the floor even when I have emptied the tray. A broom or dry dust cloth sweeper work much better. I have had some success with carpeted surfaces."
2,jackson stranded,"I borrowed this cd from a friend and listened to it in my car over a few weeks.I have my troubles spotting a good song on this album.Jackson undoubtful made a few pretty good albums in the late 70's beginning 80's, but I'm afraid that's about it....So long JoeyWe had a nice conversation in Landgraaf (Holland) in 1994 when you performed at Pinkpopfestival."
4,Doesn't dissapoint,"This is probably Joe's best since ""Blaze of Glory"". Picks up right where the JJ Band left off twenty years ago - ESSENTIAL for the JJ fan! Can't wait to see the show."
5,A must read for magicians.,This is a must read for cardicians.(people that do card tricks or works with cards). This is the bible for card workers. This book comes complete with the mystery of who even wrote it. This is not for the novice or self working card magician. The sleights will require practice to use and understand the principles.
4,Well written survey,"This book is required reading for a class I am taking on Appreciation of Architecture. It is a great intro for those of us who want to learn more about the subject and it isn't overly scholastic or too dense. It is enough to give you a thirst for more knowledge, which is what a good overview book should."
4,Good book and easy to follow.,The book is a must have for an architecture history class. Lots of stuff covered in an easy to understand text.
5,A cool collection,"Some cool stuff of Jason in the studio, it showcases his talent very well. If you enjoy this album I suggest you buy Perpetual Burn. If you want to hear music that will blow your mind away buy his Perspective album. For those who claim he is not a great composer of music like Motzart and others, then you obviously haven't heard his Perspective album. This album just contains jam sessions, you can not consider this a fair assesment of his songwriting capability. Anyway The Blackberry Jams is a cool collection of stuff and it is worth the buy, but I suggest Jason's studio efforts over this, they showcase his talent much better."
5,"It's like floating on a cloud, a happy & sad one","This is probably one of most impressive debuts of 2005; yes, their sound is similar to those of Coldplay or Keane, but who cares? from the first few tracks, what stood out besides the voice was the sound of guitars; kind of makes you hypnotised...highly recomended if you are a fan of the British Indie/Alternative genre....Notable Tracks:- Into the Fire- Thru the Glass- Gone- Do No Wrong- Saving- Last Foreveri've listed almost the whole album; it's that good; and for those who have the album and constantly listen to the first or second track and then rewind to the start, don't worry, i had that problem too; it's called listening to good music..."
3,Does it sound like Keane or DCFC? Yes. Do I care? Not really.,"Yes, these guys sound like Keane or Death Cab for Cutie. In fact, I was just listening to Party Shuffle on my iTunes and one of their songs came on and I thought, hey, what's this DCFC song? Ooops. But they're still nice to listen to, very lush.I particularly like the first two tracks, Into the Fire and Thru the Glass. I get really hooked on the lyric in Thru the Glass, ""You got us into this, so get us out of this"". It's not Shakespeare but somehow it works and just sticks in your head. I find myself humming it for hours (not in a bad Macarena way, either).And PS. I guess they have Coldplay influences but I can't stand those guys so apparently you (or at least I) can get past that."
4,Surprised me,I love the old shows and I had watched enough Make Room for Daddy shows to know that Danny was a widower with 2 kids married to a widow with one child...what I didn't know was that the early shows were of Danny and his first wife. I don't have it in front of me or I would put down the actresses names. The box was rather disappointing. It gave no information about what I would see on the tape. It turned out to be 2 episodes shown with the first wife. Which were good - still I think they should've put something on the box to indicate the content.
2,this was not what i was looking for,i pretty much waisted my time with this.it had a few episodes on there but they wernt in any particular order.i didnt get the one i wanted though so it was kind of a waist. i need the whole season i gs
5,Fantastic book,I was suprised but the book is really good for both beginers as well as experts. I learned a lot from this book even thought I have been working with sql server for a long time.Would definitely recomend to any level.
1,Page.....What pages???,"This book might be useful, but the build quality is so low it is not worth the effort to find out. After two attempts and 2+ weeks of wasted time I have yet to receive a copy that is not missing from 1423-1470. Do yourself a favor and stick with O'Reilly (at least the book will not be missing parts). If you think you are going to use the index to find something, don't waste your time A-D is missing. Lets say you want to look into auto increment.....alter table....hmm hard to guess how many topics are between A and D."
3,Not enough colors,"I purchased 2 of these garden bulbs to give as gifts. I already have one that I bought at Target. Mine has seven different colors the new ones have only three. Red, blue and green. Still very nice but not anywhere as interesting as the one I got at Target.I tried without success to get more from Target, thus my purchase of this garden bulb. Had I not already experienced the seven color bulb, this would have been very cool!"
1,Didnt work for me,"I hate descriptions because some of them do not go into detail on how it works. I figured all i had to do was connect and go, my mistake for thinking life was easy. I connected one end to my laptop and the other to an adapter I have for my TV...nothing happened. It's sad when I waste money on products and can't even return them."
2,Not gold plated!,BEWARE--I ordered this cable with the understanding it was gold plated (per the description). It arrived in a bag saying it was gold plated but the cable connectors were not.
4,S-video cable review,It's okay i guess i couldn't really tell the difference between composite cable (yellow cable) on it but some of my games do look more sharper and the lighting and darken areas look a little bit better but over all you cant really see a dramatic change it's verry affordable i use it for my sega genesis you cant go wrong buying it.
1,Doesn't work for me,"I bought this to connect my other (GVA to female S-vedio) cable to my Mitsubishi, in order to connect my computer to the TV. It just doesn't work. At best, it shows 3 fuzzy duplicated images on the TV, instead of 1 clear image. I am very annoyed..This isn't the problem with my TV, because the TV works great when I link my Ipad to the TV using a different cable."
2,Too Bad,"It was a great price, almost too good to be true and it was because within three weeks one of the prongs broke, therefore we have to buy another one."
3,cheap cheap,"Cheap cable, but what do you expect for the price, i've bought 3 cheap hdmi cables, and all of those were much nicer in quality. I would probably buy a different one next time."
5,Good distance,Now I can record my walkthroughs without having to have my computer right on top of the TV so no more echo effect in my videos.
2,Nice but dusty,"This is a really nice blanket but after just about 2 weeks, it had given off alot of dust. The way the sun comes through my bedroom window after I come home from work, I noticed that there was dust on the hardwood furniture, so I did a real quick dust down and saw that the dust cloth had a burgundy tint to it. I got the dirt devil upright out and vacuumed down the whole room (not something I wanted to do after just getting home from work) and lo and behold, there was burgundy fibers all in the collection chamber. It's one of those see thru, bagless kind. It was a layer of burgundy on top of the grayish white dust from my vacuuming a week ago. I like the blanket a lot better than the comforters my wife likes, but I don't like the dust."
1,Abandon all hope ye who rent this movie,"I did not trust the naysayers who warned how bad this movie really is. Instead, I trusted in the glowing reviews that this was in fact a science-fiction movie worth seeing. I will be happy if I have not suffered a deep psychological trauma from viewing a small portion of this cinematic abortion. The acting is terrible and without emotion. The visual quality reminds of the camcorders that you could buy for a pre-schooler that recorded on a standard cassette tape. Awful does not even begin to describe this atrocity."
5,Good For the Money.,"Other more expensive products may work better and are more sturdy and will have more protection for the floor but this one should do the job without any problems. If you need more cushions, put some felts on the legs and you are good to go. The best for the money"
3,Quilt book,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. After the first 20 pages the quilts just merged into one another - the same kinds of colours (rather boring) and fabrics and most of them are stars or use other triangle pieces. Nothing that really 'grabbed' me and said 'Wow, this is a great looking quilt'! The instructions can be helpful for other projects, so it was not a total waste. I like my quilts colourful and to make a statement, not mousy and drab. Sorry, hope it doesn't put someone off buying it, but that is how I feel."
2,Nothing that hasn't been done before and better,"Paul Gordon's music, like the show as a whole, is a lackluster amalgamation of The Secret Garden, Les Mis, and Beauty and the Beast. The tunes are pleasant enough, but nothing that stands out. The lyrics, however, are cringeworthy. They fail to capture the intricacies of the plot and characters, and they sound ridiculous. I applaud the effort, but you're better off spending money on The Secret Garden, which is similar in style but beautifully written. Jane Eyre is mediocre at best."
2,This Jane Eyre--- errs.,"This is a fabulously lush orchestrated and sung piece of bubblegum. I think Charlotte Bronte, the cast, and the audience deserve a much more lyrical piece. This hodge-podge of contemporary styles has been packaged well--- however it is not cohesive, and therefore it is a HUGE disappointment. Great voices, great orchestrations, great musical direction--- really poor score. I can understand WHY it's having trouble--- and after years of finetuning, it is still fatally flawed and unlike Rochester, this musical can not be redeemed even by such a fabulous Jane Eyre. This Jane Eyre--- errs, and I am left with why?"
4,"Beautiful, But It Really Does Sound Like Les Miserables","The recording is beautiful, poignant and passionate. However,it really does sound a great deal like Les Miserables. That is not a bad thing, because Les Miz is wonderful, but it is a bit disappointing.I am glad I purchased it and look forward to seeing the play this week."
2,not so hot,"One might expect from such an epic story a beautiful and imagionative score... I know I did. But I feel that the show was a quick shot at a hit (a shot that failed). I do make it a point that when ever I purchase a new cast recording to sit and listen to the entire album, reading along with the libretto, as to better understand the plot. And though I tried to ""get into it,"" I find the score to be simplistic and repetative, though there are a few songs that are catching. The lyrics are not at all comparitive in quality or sophistocation to the classic novel, as one could only hope for in the musical adaptation. In fact, the lyrics are quite childish-I've heard better music in badly-scripted children's theatre plays. I would not discourage you from buying the recording; I am still glad that I have added it to my collection, it's just not my favorite. Not at all."
4,"No, no, no, not like Les Miz at all","I don't see how anyone can say this cd reminds them of Les Miz. It is nowhere near as deep, emotional, or magnificent. That's not to say that it's not good. It is exceptional, just not the same style as Les Miz. The voices of Ms. Schaffel and Mr. Barbour are simply wonderful. There are songs that take your breath away and bring tears to your eyes. I bought it after seeing the show on Broadway and have listened to nothing else since. Don't see this show expecting to see Les Miz. It is simpler, less lush and sweeping. It's not a big show. It has its own charm. It reminded me, too, of The Secret Garden, in looks, in tone, and in sound."
5,Superb!,"I love the music! My friend loaned me her copy and I fell in love with it so much I had to buy a copy for myself. The music is enchanting, relaxing and yet powerful, and the melodies are gorgeous! I love how the musical follows the book very closely (some of the words are taken directly from the book), so I can follow the storyline while listening. I'm so glad we bought it!"
3,very decent,is this murphy lee or a nelly jam this is a pretty decent cut but nelly needs to let murphy shine some more and did they really need to bring jermaine dupri in this?
1,How did he get it published?,"The author has obviously researched the art of tracking. The details are facinating and informative. It appears however, that he did not research anything else, except perhaps to watch the worst Hollywood trash in search of cliche characters to go with his wildly improbable plot and laughably inaccurate scenes. Altogether this is the most completely contrived piece of.... I have run across in years."
1,As bad as they get ...,The most inane mass of macho mayhem ever written. This book is a definite waste of paper.
2,Disappointing - more of a catalog to promote Wilton products than an instructional guide,"I am planning to make a wedding cake for a friend and I bought this book and Dede Wilson's The Wedding Cake book. This seemed more like an idea book for a prospective bride to get ideas to bring to her wedding planner. I have used Wilton products before and from the description I thought it would include recipes and specific instructions about how to use various piping tips, etc. There is a short section about assembling, icing and cutting cakes but no recipes for basics like butter cream frosting, and standard flavors of cake - white, yellow, chocolate, lemon, etc. It seems more like a catalog of Wilton cake decorating accessories - plates, pillars, dowels and bride/groom ornaments. Not what I was looking for at all. I'm glad I bought the Dede Wilson book. It is much more practical as well as having beautiful photographs and many recipes."
5,Great Sounding Harmonica,"The Big River has great sound. A few days ago I was bending blues loudly, while walking on an Oregon beach. The sound really carries. I've been playing Hohner blues harps for quite awhile and finally worked around to my first big river and I'm sold! Truly I cannot say if new benders would have a problem with them because I've been bending for years and so can't tell. My impression is that big river is a very durable harmonica and fantastic for the price. So I plan to buy more."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I had always heard about Objective Burma, but had never been able to find it. It was finally aired on TV and I got to see it. The film features Errol Flynn, in one of his most impressive acting turns, stars as Captain Nelson, a paratrooper commander who leads his men into a mission that was supposed to last under a day. Instead, they are cut off and are forced to wait it out behind enemy lines, experiencing absolute hell.The movie was a pleasant surprise, as I didn't know how Flynn would play out in a WWII film. But Flynn was excellent as is the movie itself."
5,horse the band. bitch. BEST BAND EVER!!!!,horse is the most innovative and original band out there!!! go buy R. Borlax NOW!! if you are not amazed and think that they are just a bunch of art school dorks who got picked on in high school..then you are seriously need to rethink your life...they are awesome live..and are really cool guys. cant wait to see em again. Go buy the album ASAP!
1,like beating a dead horse,"this is one of the worst albums iv ever heard.im ashamed of owning it. i didnt even buy it, i burned it.im ashamed of writing over cd-r with ""horse the band""im ashamed of having a friend that said ""nintendoXcore"" (yes, with the X)now just because theres no other better way to say ""not quite bad enough to be called hxc and not quite good enough to be called synthpop""their synth player looks like napolean dynamite.and at that these guys cant even rip off having a jerk attitude live, they just suck. and they suck at having long hair.i rather have jamie jasta giving me a backrub by a fireside to six feet under, while reading printoffs of pitchforks favorite albums of 2000-presentfolks, the synth build up is greater when i get ready to tinkle at 2 in the morning.don't waste your time."
5,A Good Introduction,I am appreciative of Mr. Poole courage in writing a relatively true history of the moors. This book is written in narrative form. It's more like a story. I believe if you read this books with Ivan Van Sertima's The Golden Age of the Moor you will have a good knowledge of the Moors and the role in civilizing Spain. Mr. Van Sertima's book is stricktly academic.
2,This book is a reprint,"Readers should be aware that this is a merely reprint of a book published in the last century. The date on the book is the date of the reprinting. It hardly represents the latest scholarship! If you really want to learn something about the moors, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,Heavy on conservation.,"I was disappointed--this DVD is rather heavy on conservation. But the scenery is beautiful, the places shown are interesting. Still, less emphasis on conservation and more beautiful scenery/story would help. I appreciate that people are working to preserve the environment, but don't like it to be the total focus of the story.We see a confined location in the Egyption desert, a South African game preserve, Another desert area in Morocco, and tourism building in Sechelles--all in about 30 minutes each.I give the dvd 3 stars for the photography. I purchased this dvd and Green Paridise's Pacific Islands. I doubt that I'll buy another."
3,"Love the film, not such a great soundtrack!","The film has got to be one of the funniest ever, i laugh harder each time i see it! it is just hilarious despite its cheesiness-that just makes it better! its a shame the soundtrack doesnt do it the justice it deserves, kirsten dunst's song makes me cringe a little when listened to while not watching the film. But 'Love Will Keep Us together' I still play in the car and sing at the top my lungs with it-its the best. I'll never fall in love again is another great song as well as Another Perfect Day and Allison but the rest are a bit boring. And not putting Sisqo's September on the soundtrack is purely Criminal-what were they thinking?? still, an ok soundtrack, but nothing compared to the film which is a sure 5 star rating!Bex x"
5,"It's a bit raw, but great","After reading the other reviews on this album I had to chime in. Being an original line-up Sabbath fan(sorry guys, Dio sucks end of story) I think this album is great. While the quality and performances aren't perfect, no live album should be. This album gives you the feel of what it was like in the mid-seventies going to a Sabbath concert, and few live albums have that ability. The live jam of Wicked World is an amazing show of the jam skills of this band live. Iommi goes everywhere and Ozzy follows right along. Comments about Ward's out of time solo are bogus in my opinion, if it's out of step, then it's a mistake that works. This album reminds you that these four Brummies weren't necessarily gunning to be best on the block, but they certainly deserved to be. If you're a Sabbath fan, this album is a must. If you think Dio is anything at all, then pass, you're not really a Black Sabbath fan anyhow."
3,Squeeeeeek,"Black Sabbath had more than 10 years of touring and recording under their belts when this album was released in 1980, so the title was appropriate - it was about time for something live. Unfortunately, this is a bootleg quality recording, complete with wailing feedback at the start of each song and an overall messy sound. On the other hand, one could argue that it reveals the band as they really sounded live in the '70s. No studio overdubs that would rob the recording of it's authenticity. I tend to believe that there is a realness to the album, one of the highpoints being the extended jam on Wicked World. I like it, but I would have to caution that you will probably have to be a great lover of Black Sabbath to really get into this album. Also, I'm not sure what the advantage is of buying a specially high priced import. I guess it carries some weight if you are a collector, otherwise stick with the non-import and pay half the price."
4,CRUUUUU!!!!,"Great playlist. Songs are organized in an excellent order. Pretty good for an awesome band. I was new to Motley Crue, now I am big fan."
1,Re-Mastered in 1998 or 2003? Audio quality is garbage,"I bought this from an Amazon dealer as used. I chose the 2003 release, but the seller ""good_clean"" sent me a 1998 release. I see two release dates for this cd. So, which is correct and how did this get two different release dates??? The 1998 release I received was in excellent condition and arrived as described (punch hole in the bar code back cover art). The audio quality for this RE-MASTER is horrific!!! It's close to sub par analog quality. I paid almost $20.00 for a USED cd, because these cd's are out of print. Yes, the songs are awesome but the quality of sound for a Re-Master is non-existent. I assume this is why it was forced to shut down at the manufacturing plant. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
1,People who buys this album probally should get permanent brain damage......,"I could honestly say, that the time this band was concieved, I did not like them at all, that was grade school people. But dumbfounded me decided back in I think it was 87 or 88, whatever it was bought Girls, Girls, Girls, boy what a let down that was I must say. I had a friend that idoled them, and I could not handle it, I had to put him out of his misery, just kidding, but I sure let him have it many times over. I just can't get into Vince Neil, nor the walking disease Tommy Lee, they both nausaete me too death with their perversions. And as far as the music goes, just pure garbage, fresh from the pile of leftovers from the cruddy hair band 80's. I would have to say, I would have a better time smacking myself with a hammer several times and get permanent brain damage than to happen to listen to these songs all over again."
3,Not so preachy like the rest of his books.,"Being a World Harvest Bible College Student, I had to read this book. To me, all his books are the same. Alot of us students think that if you read ""Repairers of the Breach"" or any other book of his, you read them all. This one was a little different and not so preachy which I enjoyed. Though I personally do not care for the way he writes, I still greatly repsect the man. Being at the church and college and working with people who knew him personally, I know he is an awesome man of God, though the comments above do not agree. Parsley does have a very high standard of morality and so much faith which I admire. All in all, this is one of his less preachy books and actually has new stuff in it (No offense to him). Out of all of his books, this may be the best."
1,Not very sturdy,"For a product that is supposed to be used to hit ice, the circular tapper portion is not securely attached to the metal bar. After only a couple of uses the 2 parts came apart and now the tapper is useless."
4,A solid 12 song comp of Patti's work on Mercury with caveats,"Although this sports new remastering, unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume ""Patti Page Collection"" series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order. Fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at Amazon."
5,Remembering Patti Page,"This CD contains the most popular Patti Page hits from the 1950s era, including the original version of the Tennessee Waltz, and a true collector's item."
2,"Patti 5 Stars, 20th Century Masters 2","Unfortunately there is no way to leave a review just for the production of the CD. Without need to review Patti Page, the sound quality on this series is sorely lacking. The highs are unbearably harsh, and yes, I have a very good sound system.I'm afraid that this may be indicative of the 20th Century Masters series. I guess they may be cheap for a reason."
4,Arkansaw Traveller by Earlene Fowler,Most enjoyable with interesting insights into the race realtions of the South. The development of the characters and imsights are always more interesting than the plot.
3,Shibori: The Art of Fabric Tying Folding Pleating and Dyeing,"A very nice, well illustrated book, though not specifically what I was looking for. I wanted a book that addressed supplemental weft (weaving) and subsequent dyeing to produce Shibori.This books strictly addresses the different techniques(folding, twisting, dyeing) used to achieve a certain look. More advanced than tie-dye, but similar in approach. Would be a good reference for someone getting involved in Surface Design and Fabric manipulation. Worth the price."
2,"Yes,I Agree,Dissappointing","I recieved this book for Christmas, and was truly sorry I had placed it on my wish list....I found this book very simplistic,poorly researched and most of all it presented terrible examples of finished projects. A real ""Faux pas"" No mention ot the long Japanese history for this technique, or examples of the many exquisite traditional pieces.........This is not even good enough for the library.......They should have saved the trees@"
4,Good pictures; more color needed,"This book collects dozens of drawings (and *one* photo) of the Great War. Most are in black and white (though I assume they mostly were done in color), and there are just a few color pages thrown in.About every aspect of the war is covered, as you can see from the list of chapters: trenches, dugouts, ""no man's land"", artillery, raids and patrols, weapons, tanks, stretcher bearers, gas attacks, mining, signaller, runners, grenades, and more.From a modeler's point of view, it's quite useful both for detailing and for dioramas ideas: recommended!"
3,Jen,"When I received the book it looked as though the box had come open and the binding was ruined a bit, pages intact though. It was a used book so I am not sure if it was from the shipping or what. It is for a pathophysiology class so it wasn't critical to have a pristine new book. It's useable and thats all that matters."
5,MERK MANUALS,"The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 18th EditionOne needs to read this and Merk Physicians' Desk Reference with thoughtfulness, an open mind for learning, and a cautionary attitude knowing that not all information on any topic is entirely relavant to your concern. The PDR,to me,is least useful as other drug descriptions are avaiable if one is concerned with relative few medications. The MMD&T; has been a reliable source in my family from before the 4th Edition in 1950. My father was a physician and more than likely started with the 1st Edition years earlier. You should also have access to a medical dictionary as many words/names are relatively unknown to the lay reader. Knowing one word sometimes is the key to understanding the whole presentation in it's proper light. Pray for leading and patience to understand and this technical reference will be of great beneifit. My dad lived to be over 99 and I'm on my way to 82."
5,Best Medical Reference for Layman!,Have owned both the 15th and 16th editions and find the information concise and useful. I am not a medical professional but using this reference I can find information on various conditions and then speak with some inteligence to my physician concerning my own situation. Look forward to owning the 17th edition soon. Best medical reference I've found.
5,It's a Classic!,"I saw this video as a child. It was one of my favorites! Jim Henson does an ingenious job (as usual) combining a classic fairytale with slap-stick comedy. I would recommend this as one of THE best family movies to watch with the kids. I only wish it were still in print so my children could see it. A wonderful film for all ages. Timeless, really. If you like muppets you'd love this! If I ever see it in print again I'm buying it without another thought."
4,Jim Henson's First TV Special is a Classic!,"My mom saw this as a TV special in 1971 and liked it so much she named me Melora, after the princess who kisses the frog! According to her it was the 1st Jim Henson/Muppet TV special, though I'm not positive she's right... Either way, it's a family classic, and one of the better in the Muppet ouevre. They need to bring it out on DVD pronto!"
3,Must have in DVD,"I just wanted to agree with another review already written. This is a great movie and I have been looking to purchase it however, I no longer own VHS tapes nor do I own a tape player. I would purchase in a heartbeat if it were on DVD."
5,A film that deserves to be on DVD.,"This is a lovely movie which I remember fondly from childhood. Once you've seen a story told by the muppets (Frog Prince, Christmas Carol etc) you are ruined for all other versions. I can only hope the powers that be see fit to release this gem on DVD so that old fans can re-live their childhoods and new fans can become enchanted."
3,Ok.,They were larger than needed and too moist. They got te job done and were reasonably priced. I would buy again but maybe smaller version.
4,Allison Weir and War of the Roses,"I love Allison Weir's books. Each one stands alone, but are linked to her others. This book fills in a void about who has power and when and why."
4,"She made a difficult and complex time, a little less difficult and complex","Very well written. I guess the cliche' fits in that she made a history book read like a novel. However through no fault of Weir's, it is just an incredibly difficult subject matter, therefore, it was still confusing at times.The only thing I would fault the book (whether it is Weir's fault or the publisher's, I don't know) is the family trees at the back of the book. They were hand written and in such small font, that I had a hard time deciphering them.Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this subject matter."
2,The Official History,"Weir's book is pretty much the the conventional accepted history. The kind of thing you would have learned in the UK 30 yrs ago for ""O"" and ""A"" Levels in School. The characters are conventional sterotypes, there is little reference to recent more interesting scholarship, and a lack of undertsnding of just how different pre-modern dynastic families saw the world. It does do a good job on sorting out the event but there is so much more that could have been said that could really have brought this to life. To get a feel for the period try the (admittedly partisan) ""Bosworth: The Psychology of a Battle"" by Micheal Jones."
4,Very entertaining!,I was tied to it. Read it very quick and will read it a second time. Good writing.
1,Poor History,"Alison Weir continues to spout the Tudor propaganda, even in the face of evidence that it was the Tudors who kept this war going, and that it was the Tudors that killed the Princes (even after evidence that their mother wrote to her cousin telling her of a visit to see the boys AFTER Richard III was dead). Some people believe what they want, but Historians should seek out the answers, not simply regurgitate what others have writen before them. She constantly ignores evidence that shows the good side of the Yorkists, and the rather brutish side of the Tudors.Not recomended to anyone wishing to learn the truth. Two thumbs way down. Heck, read Daughter of Time for a less fictional tale."
1,Not what I thought.....,"Now dont get me wrong, I love Bone Thugs n Harmony but this album is not what I thought it would be. It,s good for poeple who like those different types of beats. But for hardcore BONE fans (like me) this CD will let you down. The Bizzy Bone CD is better than this. It also has a better rating. I know L-Burna ( aka. Layzie Bone) can do better than this. I've seen him do better. L-Burna, no hard feelings, but TRY AGAIN."
5,Awesome Debut,Man this cd is off tha chain every sond is good and the production is great. Layzie is a awesome rapper and speaks from experience and the truth he aint no poser and i never see any bone thug material on t.v. which a good and bad thing cause they wont go pop but they dont get any air play and nobody knows about them which is sad cause they r missing out on some great stuff. Buy all the bone thug material that u can find cause they r all awesome and worth the purchase. Dont sleep on this album its good and will be one of my favorites for a long time to come. Buy this cd
3,L-Burna,"I am a big Bone Thugs n Harmony fan but I think this album could be a little better. It doesnt have the hard bass that the other Bone songs I've listen to have. I think Layzie is tight but his cd didnt feel like a Bone cd. I think if he added more of the hard bass and have the style of East 99, the cd would of been off the hook. However it was pretty good, but I dont think I would bump it in my car on my way to work."
3,If Only A Bone Fan,"If you a fan of bone then you know u have to get their album. This album is not that good. Layzie should bring more songs like the last song called ""as the rain"" which Bone to me makes the best r.i.p songs then after that is Master P & No Limit. I give it 3 stars for couple good songs and a star cause its a Bone member. Bizzy Bone and Layzie Bone shouldn't release their album in the same day."
4,Big & Roomy! Rugged!,"This is a large, rugged, well-built equipment case. A person can adapt this case to carry a wide variety of electronic & photographic equipment. Using the Kata yelloop dividers, I can easily pack my Hasselblads & P67 gear in a variety of configurations and with the optional trolley, I am good-to-go. An earlier reviewer complained about the exterior design of the case, and I would agree that it is not easily jammed into tight aircraft spaces on all airlines. It is by definition ""a multi-case"" and holds a lot of heavy gear in a weather resistant shell. Likewise, loading it and putting it on my shoulder would be folley; hence the trolley option.If you are looking for a flexible carry solution for a lot of bulky camera equipment, this is an option. I have other Kata bags and find them very rugged, easy to reconfigure when needed and a good value over the longer term."
4,Night Cry-Rin Tin Tin,"This is one of the remaining Rin Tin Tin movies. It features early special effects. I enjoyed the movie very much. Rinty is a big ham in this movie greatly surpassing the acting ability of the rest of the cast. It follows the successful formula of Rin Tin Tin movies. The story line and actors are dated but there is nothing dated about his performance. The special effects add excitement although cheesy, I think that Rin Tin Tin loved making this film and for that reason I recommend it whole-hardheartedly."
5,Another Rinty Classic!,"Rin-tin-tin's acting is even better than Where The North Begins! I can see why he became practically an American icon in the 20's. The human actors are pretty good, too, especially the woman who plays the wife. But the ""mover and shaker"" is Rinty."
4,Not bad for the price,"Well made, and mostly metal. Only had for about a month,but so far, it does the job. The safety latch/ lock is not a good design. They should've spent just a little more time and design a better latch that provides more leverage. The small plastic lever can be difficult to lock the blades shut, and I can tell it will break within a year. Otherwise, a pretty decent pair of shears for the money."
5,Book for Geologically Literate,"This book is not a travelogue for the scientifically uninitiated. If you have studied geology and enjoy the interplay with Roman history, it is terrific. Well done for a work that marries social studies with science. For example, you gain a different view of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva when you take the Tiber floods into account as explained in this book. This is not a beach read with flowing prose, it is a compelling piece for those who treasure deeper knowledge. The romance of this book is not found in grandiloquent vocabulary, but in the profundity of understanding."
4,Bruce,Works great.recommended by person who refinished our floors. Looks like new every time we clean. Sometimes it's a bit slippery
1,"Toxic, better to make your own!","I looked up the ingredients in this after using it and feeling weird and light-headed afterward. The MSDS warned against breathing the vapors and recommended wearing ""Suitable protective equipment"". It contains 2-butoxyethanol which is a carcinogena and damages the adrenals.For MUCH LESS money you can make your own floor cleaner using equal parts of rubbing alcohol, vinegar, and water. It works JUST AS WELL. Add some essential oil if you want it scented."
2,rip off,LOVE the product. HATE that it's double the price than would you could get at Home Depot or Lowes. Total rip off.
4,Cam can do better,"I bought this CD after i purchased cam's mad blunted jazz. needless to say i am very dissappointed. Cam doesn't show his full potential in this album, and it is a very lack luster cd compared to his others. cam's a genious and all, but this album doesn't show it."
3,Don't trust the measurements,"This case looks pretty good but the measurements Gator has posted on their website are WAY off. To demonstrate what their dimensions represent, Gator shows a picture of a guitar showing the actual guitar body dimensions. This is not so. This case was way too small for my guitar and found the 10"" upper bout dimension listed was actually between the plywood walls and NOT the cushion. What use is that? Before I bought it I knew there was some risk because I read people discuss this case. On one thread one guy said his GW-LPS was too big and his guitar bounced around. Another had my complaint and another said his fit just right. If you're going to buy one be sure to buy it at Amazon so you can send it back like I did"
3,Not mint!,"When something is described as like new or mint, I take it to mean that it is indistinguishable from a new copy and I could give it as a gift without embarrassment. The slip case clearly indicated this was a used item. It it had been described as very good or maybe even excellent, I would have no gripe but it was described as ""mint""."
1,what a downer!!,"Although well written, this book is a totally depressing read. I slogged my way through to the end and then wondered why I did it. If you like extreme tragedy, grief, betrayal and sloooww movement, then this is the book for you. I kept hoping for some redeeming moment to arrive. It didn't."
2,Was disappointed after a few months...,"I tried this razor after the orginal Venus and originally loved it. But, I've gone through 2 of these razors in the past several months. I love the blades and the closeness of the shave. But, I have discovered that it has a serious design flaw that the orginal didn't have. Both of my razors broke in the middle of the handle. The orginal Venus had hard plastic that went from top to bottom. The Divine has hard plastic that goes a couple inches down from the top and then it stops and has a rubber piece that comes up from the bottom. Then has a few more inches of the hard plastic. Both of the razors that I had broke right in the middle where the hard plastic was missing. It is very disappointing, but I will not be buying this razor again."
4,Gillette Venus,"This is a very good product, has a good performance, nice size and very easy to install on the wall."
4,Excellent Razor,This is an excellent razor. I would look in your weekly coupons for a coupon and buy it from Wal Mart and you may come out a bit cheaper. I bought it through Amazon since saving 50 cents at Walmart was not that big of a deal. The blades don't leave any nicks or cuts. I'm getting about one month of use out ot the cartridges.
2,Though it was a good idea...,"I thought it would be great to have an extra rod to hang towels on when we have company. However, the quality is so poor it only lasted 10 months. One of the rods over-extended itself while being installed the first time and we had to force it into place. We recently remodelled and can't re-use the rod because we were unable to remove it without breaking it. Also, the finish is not metal at all but painted plastic. This should have been half the cost for the poor quality. I would not recommend this product."
2,It rusts,"It rusts. ""Stainless steel"" is the color not the material. Misleading labeling.It matches our bathroom walls which are ""lemon"", but they are yellow and not made of lemons."
1,Challenge with the rod,"I brought this rod based on all the nice reviews I read here and the double rod seems to be a good solution for the tower. However,I'm facing a challenge right now. Does anyone know how and if the rod can be shortened, as I pull the rod out too much and it's longer than the space between the walls of the bath tub. It seems like I couldn't get it back short anymore...Any advise?"
2,Poor quality materials!,This rod rusts within a year of installation. It is not stainless steel as advertised. It is also hard to put up and nearly impossible to remove.
3,Worked -- but,"Got the double rods because I have no towel racks in the bath. Worked wonderfully -- when we finally wrestled it in place. Took two people. BUT last week in came crashing down. Why?? Don't know. Was a beast to get up and seemed to be permanently in place. AND on top of it all it took off the finish of my Re-Bath tile where it pressed into it. I'm going to have to buy another rod (I know, I threw away the mounting package on the first one) and drill it into the wall. Maybe I should just get two rods and make it easy on myself."
5,Great book!,A great book with very clear instructions and diagrams. Good reference book for making a variety of different large or small scale quilts.
5,Nancy W. (ladyd340),"Great to deal with and will again. Book was used, but it look as if it was new. Book was delivered real fast."
5,Great Conductor Representation,This product was much better quality than was anticipated....the entertainment value they were used for was reached and the packaging and shipping of the product was wonderful!!
1,poor customer service,"This item says ""colors may vary"", since I wanted 10 clear-colored cases, I called and spoke to a customer service representative. She repeatedly assured me that the cases were indeed ""clear"", ""uncolored"", ""untinted"" and ""see-through"". After rephrasing my question about the color about 5 times and listening to her reassurances, I placed the order. Yet when the order arrived, 3 were clear and 7 were red, orange or blue. Clearly, customer service was wrong and they need additional training."
3,Is this a book or an infomertial for RPI and the magazine?,"Having read several books by the author, I was somewhat disappointed on several planes: his use of old material from his magazine and lack of expanded coverage from his many contributors. Case studies need room to breathe, brevity is not necessarily helpful in this case. The authors could also go beyond their stable of previous writers and RPI alumni for assistance.Is this a discussion about solving environmental problems or is this book an infomertial for Corporate Environmental Strategy and RPI?"
5,A must have book for Environmental Leaders of the Future,"Piasecki's book on Environmental Mgmt and Business Strategy fills an important gap that other environmental books don't address..LEADERSHIP. His book draws upon the experiences and struggles of those who have gone before us in moving their company beyond compliance. The book is filled with relevant case histories, executive spotlights, questions for further thought, and suggestions for further reading. This book is a must have for those looking to develop the business model that includes EH&S."
3,Okay reference book,"This text was used in a class where I was the teaching assistant. There were numerous complaints from students about how the text was difficult to follow, and in some cases the examples were even incomplete. This was a class for junior engineering students as a first thorough course in fluids, the text was not helpful. As a graduate student I found it to be a good reference of basic concepts (although, it was hard for me to follow some of the examples). It even goes in depth with many concepts. All in all it is a good basic reference, but totally inadequate for beginning instruction.As a note to instructors, the solution manual is loaded with errors."
2,"Poor examples,","The book is easy to read however, it is very hard to solve the problems. The author does not do a very good job showing which equation's are used. In the example problems the author bring's in values which are constant's but does not indicate what the values are and the units. It is a very hard text book to follow. However the derivation of the formulas are done very well."
3,Great When It's Finally Done,I do like my sewing table now that it's put together. The process of getting it done was challenging for myself. The directions were a bit confusing and not detailed enough for anyone. All of the parts were there and I stuck to it. I did not have the strength to tighten the cams fully and most of the table fell apart as I moved it down the hall. Help! A friend helped me re-build it and he had the tools and muscle to complete it well. Please make sure to have two people put it together since it is not the easiest project to build.
1,Sauder sewing table,"[Garbage.Particle board. Poor directions. Doors don't fit, cams strip easily. Run from this one, it's a right piece of junk.[ASIN:B000F9WESW American Cherry Craft and Sewing Cart American Cherry]]"
2,"Missing Critical Part, Poorly Made as Well","Typical Sauder ""quality"" (mostly sawdust and plastic). In addition mine was missing the back which apparently stabilizes the entire structure (according to this line from the instructions): ""CAUTION Do not stand the unit upright without the BACK fastened. The unit may collapse.""It will be 7-9 business days before a replacement part arrives so this has to lie flat somewhere until then or it might fall apart. I would expect a rush shipment for a missing part along with an apology too but it doesn't look like I'm getting either one.Missing parts or not, I recommend looking elsewhere before settling on this one.**2013-01-22 Update**I've added an additional star because, while I stand by my original assessment of the poor quality of the materials and construction of this item, it does provide a unique capability and design that I have not seen in other utility carts."
4,Two classic (yet different) west coast jazz LPs in one!,"This is one of those ""two-fers"" put out by the Collectables label which features two vintage LPs on one disc. While the two Lps couldn't be more different, it's worth the price to get either depending upon your preference. The first is a session called ""West Coast Wailers"" by the Conte Candoli Quintet which includes Candoli on trumpet and Bill Holman on tenor. It's essentially the same group and format as Candoli's Bethlehem release ""Powerhouse Trumpet"" but in my opinion, not quite as good. It features 8 west coast bop charts mostly arranged by Holman. Great classic stuff. The second is an LP featuring singer Chris Conner backed by a big studio orchestra and strings. Not my favorite format but Conner's voice and phrasing makes it very digestable. How can you go wrong?"
2,Not so great for me,"I bought this product after using Noxema's triple clean antibacterial face wash, which I really enjoyed. I was hoping that this product would take my level of satisfaction beyond that a step, and help eliminate the blackheads I continuously get on my nose and forehead. Unfortunately, the product didn't eliminate this issue and felt as though it left a layer of ointment on my face. I won't be using it again. I've since stocked up on Noxema's triple clean antibacterial face wash."
5,Magnificent pleasure,The purity of her sound and genuine interpretation draws us into her world from the first phrase. She is truly one of the most magnificent artists of our times. I highly recommend this disc to all classic music lovers.
2,"Monstrosity, The Atomic Bore","This early 1960s black and white ""horror"" film is a prime example of the misunderstood evil genius-reanimated zombie genre typical of the era. The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!"
5,Decent helmet - nice adjustments,"I am new to welding and have only tried on other helmets at friends houses. I knew I wanted one that had a large window and was comfortable. After reading some reviews here about this helmet I thought I would go for it.Pros:+ Very comfortable and adjustable+ Large glass means you can keep your head in just the right position and not kink your neck.+ Holds well in the up position and with a nod can closeCons:- Sometimes even outside it is very dark, I would consider getting an auto darkening one, but at this price-point this is a fine helmet.Overall a nice helmet at a very good price.Thanks for reading my review."
3,Another great snack read,"These books are like the potato chips mentioned by another reviewer here on Amazon: start snacking on them and it's hard to stop.This is fun escape fiction: romance, suspense, mystery, and everybody living in terrific Manhattan homes which they own free and clear. Oh, and they are all thin and gorgeous and doing interesting things. Which in Morgan Tyler's case includes television writing, daytime drama production, amateur sleuthing, and occasional attempts on her life by ruthless murderers. All carried off with panache, of course.The real puzzler for me was why the cat on the cover? Hint: you find out at the very end.Toss the Morgan Tyler mystery books into your tote when heading to the airport or the beach. They are great escapes."
4,"Men Without Shame - Phantom, Rocker and Slick","The title song on this album is easily the best of the lot. Yes, the album version of the song is only available on vinyl. (WE'RE MORE THAN READY FOR THE CD, PLEASE!!!!). An abreviated (3 minutes and 47 seconds) version of the song was available on a compilation CD released in the 90's called ""Guitar Gods."" Not a great CD (nor was it very well produced) but definitely worth listening to if you've never heard Men Without Shame. Unfortunately, the best part of the song, the lead guitar intro, was cut on this version. Again, we're REALLY ready for the CD version fo the original album, Men Without Shame."
4,this music stands essentially alone-not for everyone,"I first heard some of this music in David Byrne's ""True Stories"", although at the time I didn't know it. What I do know is that Philip Glass's work: ""Solo Piano"" is fantastic-5 star in my book. So moving forward I picked up ""Glassworks"" for more of the same Glass-greatness.Well, this is an ensemble, not a solo piano. So the repetitious - driving - undulating thrust of the notes are voiced by instruments other than (and including) the piano. It can be repetitious and difficult, even as background music.I give it 4 stars because it is so unique, bold, original and challenging. And I am glad to have this work in my collection."
1,The Force is weak in this one...,"When I bought the Star Wars RPG from Wizards of the Coast all I could think was WOW this is Great!!!When I purchased this book all I could think was WOW what a waste of money!!!This book contains little to nothing that is needed to run a good Star Wars RPG and it almost seems as if WotC just put it out there to see who would buy it. This book contains no generic starships, no better space combat system (than the original RPG) and no new or interesting character building materials.Just a waste..."
3,Threshold the Blue Angles Experience DVD,"Just received this DVD from ThresholdBlu.....com, is there no menu on this DVD?I put it in player and it just started playing. I understand it is from an older VHS version. Picture quality is only average but the narration is great."
4,black,"This doc...is awesome.....bleaker than most...but a differing topic in realtion to the Holocaust. For those of us Jewish...or those enticed w/ the topic...a must, I leave out one star...as I think the flick culd have gotten a little deeper into detail about the why..."
4,Getting back to form,"being a Hip fan from near the beginning, and living in musically monotonous Atlanta, I look forward to every release. The bands skills continued to increase, album to album, until they reached a crest with Day for Night. Since then, every album has had its quality moments, but has not held itself together like their earlier work --- until now. In Violet is a strong, classic Hip album, not to be missed by any Hip fan, casual on up. I won't tire you with opinions/rants of individual songs, there are enough other reviews to do that. Safe to say, if you enjoyed Day for Night, Fully Completely, Road Apples, even Up to Here or Phantom Power, you will enjoy In Violet Light. Exclusive fans of Music @ Work and Trouble at Henhouse, need not apply. Ok, go ahead, you'll like it anyway."
4,"Not my favorite Hip album, but probably the best!","So I am one of the biggest Hip fans, I grew up on Up To Here and Road Apples. Road Apples will always be my personal favorite because the songs bring back memories. I own all the Hip albums, and I have to say that ""In Violet Light"" really blew me away. It shows how far the band has come as musicians. This album is by far the best produced Hip album, and I can easily see why it won over the music critics. The music is deep and different on this album. The Hip are a band that constantly evolves, every album's sound changing from the last, and I think this album is the best they've ever sounded, ""In Violet Light"" is an elegant masterpiece for The Hip."
2,So-so by Hip standards,"The Hip have a certain percentage of uncritical fans who go ga-ga over whatever they do; and some folks just do dig this CD. But the fact is, In Violet Light combines with their previous effort, Music@Work, to mark the low ebb in the career of this remarkable band. Yes, it improves on M@W in that it actually features coherently-written songs with actual, discernable melodies and hooks (including the devastating rumination on Canada's role in an age of teror, 'The Dark Canuck'). But Gordon Downie's lyrics---which are spectacularly revitalized on the subsequest disc, 'In Between Evolution'---remain too scholarly and abstract here, the vocals lack conviction, and the production values sap the band of all the energy and menace that define it. An album to buy if you are already a convinced fan. Otherwise, skip this, and go directly to 'In Between Evolution,' which shows the band snapping back into form and kicking ass on all levels."
3,"Too little Jekyll, too much social work","I had high expectations of this book, as I've read a lot of Robert Bloch's work and enjoyed it. The book is very well-written, but a bit slow. Jekyll's niece, Hester, doesn't recieve her inheritance until after more than half of the book has passed. It is interesting to see what happens to the original book's surviving characters, such as Poole and Utterson. But simply too much time is taken up by Hester getting upset over slum conditions and (after getting rich) buying herself new dresses. And the ending was a big disappointment, too simple and totally unbelievable."
4,XP PRO Must Haves,"If you belive XP PRO is still the only system to have, then you need all the info you can get. This resource kit is a very good addition to your info library. It's not to techical, yet it explains the ""how to's"" very clearly."
1,I wouldn't trust it.,"This book may be good entertainment but I wouldn't trust it as a source of reliable facts.One of the lists I looked at,WWI Fighter Aces,had at least half a dozen errors in it.I also agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the authors' political bias,we don't need to read that."
2,"Might Wanna Double Check Some Of These ""Facts""","This updating of an apparent 1970's mega-hit is at its best when it compiles opinion style lists from various people (such-an-such's favorite novels, movies, etc.) and begs the question, ""Are they sure of what they're saying here?"" when it comes to the lists about things that were not personal opinion but rather supposedly rooted in fact.Just my humble sugestion but I wouldn't bet the farm on everything you see claimed as concrete fact in this book."
1,cuckold,there was no sex in this movie. i like to see interracial sex but this movie did not meet my expectation.
3,Maybe I'm not using enough?,I have researched and reviewed loads of great stuff regarding this product. I have seen somewhat diminishing of the cellulite on my backside however but that was only when I was dieting and exercising consistently. Does anyone know if It will work on it's own?
3,seems to be working,I have started using this cream back in January. I also started a diet around the same time I've tried diet and exercise alone before and didn't exactly lose inches on my hips and thighs. Genetically I have the tendancy for heavy thighs and hips.I can honestly say that I see an improvement on my troubled areas.
4,I actually see results,The product goes on easily and smells really good. I've been applying it according to the instructions and I feel that the area appears to be more toned.I would have given this a higher rating but the bottle came damaged. The top doesn't allow you to press down on it to dispense the cream.
4,Celluthin works great,I have had a heck of a time toning up for summer this year. I went as far as using a personal trainer. Fully clothed I felt pretty confident with my body image however put me in a swimsuit and I would have just about died. Celluthin has definately helped with the dimply stuff on my derrier.I highly recommend it to others with my issue.
3,good performance (of the concerto); disappointing sound,"I agree with the 2-star reviewer about the sound on this very interesting disc. What's particularly disappointing is that Abbado seems really involved -- he's a superb Brahms conductor and he gives his all here -- and Yo-Yo Ma's playing is beautiful, but the balance seems out of whack and the climaxes congested. This is a 1986 digital recording -- comparing it to Haitink's 1970 recording with Starker and Szerying is revealing: the older Philips sound and engineering is superior, and Haitink brings plenty of energy to the table. I also prefer Szerying's playing to Stern's, but that may be a matter of engineering. The chamber music that fills the disc is attractive, but there are many other fine performances of the Piano Quartets out there."
1,Set Up a Major Pain -- Make sure you have the right port,"The product description glosses over the problems you may encounter trying to connect this thing to your PC. It only supports a male 9-pin serial port. If you do not have one, you need to buy an adapter. Even then, you may be unpleasantly surprised. I bought a 9- to 25-pin serial adapter at Radio Shack only to burn an hour trying to set it up, and finally found, deep on the company web site, an explanation that it would only support a male 25- adapter. Now I have ordered a $20 +$5 shipping USB adapter off the Wizcom website. (Don't be fooled by the ""optional USB"" nonsense in the product description. It is optional in the sense that you can buy the $20 adapter later, after wasting half a day wading through the poorly documented material.) I feel that this company has been deliberately vague about the issues a customer is likely to encounter in setting this thing up. Oh, and I forgot to mention the UI's on both the pen and the desktop are wack."
3,Fun and Messy,"This is Paul at his loosest. Having fun with blues based rock. Not the best album he can do, but a good album to throw on while drinking at night. Enjoyable, but my hair doesn't stand on end like it can when Westerberg is at his peak. For an example of that, go listen to ""Come Feel Me Tremble"", released at the same time as this (or ""Stereo/Mono"" which is even better)."
2,"An ""ok"" Camera if you get it cheap!","I bought one at Target for $88. Not bad for a 3.3 mp camera. But it is a cheapie ... cheap optics, cheap construction. If you get a good price and go in knowing the limitations, probably an ok deal. Close-ups suck, must be apx 24"" away or image is blurry. The flash takes forever to recharge & washes out images when used. If you want to take your SD memory card out to transfer images, you have to open your battery door & reset date/time each time. If you're taking a pic in a even pretty good lighting setting you need to hold the camera perfectly still for quite a while or image will be blurry. Don't try to review images on the nominally backlit display unless you are in a closet. It's a battery hog, buy recharge-ables .. flash charges a bit faster with rechargables too.. Minimal onboard memory, you'll want to upgrade memory right away. All in all it's ok for the price & pics are really good if taken outdoors during the day."
1,Worst By Far...,"This is the worst camera I've ever owned. Picture quality is average, however I have to replace the batteries everytime I use the camera. I purchased the recommended batteries which gave even worse results than standard AA's. After taking a few pictures the camera will ""hang"" on a pic. and destroy the image.Customer service offered no help unless I wanted to pay them to inspect the camera for problems."
2,No customer service,"I found that it was fairly simple to set up and take the pictures. There is a delay in focusing and it goes through batteries quickly. I had difficulty with the USB driver, however. When I called the only number I could locate in the owners manual, I got the corporate office. There were options to connect with customer service or tech support, but you have to leave a message on a machine for them to call you back. More than a day later, I get the phone call (while I'm driving down the road) and when the Vivitar employee couldn't answer my questions, he offered to transfer me to tech support. Another answering machine!! If you don't encounter any problems with this camera, count your blessings. If problems do arise.. good luck! I certainly won't be purchasing any more Vivitar products."
2,FAIR-Not for quality purposes,"This camera is basically good for mid quality family pictures and similar shots, you can't expect much from a non-optical zoom/ 3.3 mp camera, PLEASE!!! Anybody who tells you how great the camera is, never had anything better on their hands,LETS BE HONEST it is not a bad camera but not a smart choice if you are looking for quality. It's actualy a pretty handy and easy to use camera, not too many features and cheap, so there you go...if you need something not too fancy, cheap and you are not expecting some awarded National geographic pictures from it, this is your camera."
3,Nice book,"It's a nice book.This was a great buy from a garage sale. it only cost me about $2, but I am not so sure if I would pay $10 for it, maybe if it came with a nicer cover, a hard cover or something with a better design.The way it's printed and presented, does not make this book worth paying $10 or more, I've seen better copies on the web for about the same price with nicer pictures and more variety. I would give it more stars if it was cheaperPros: it only has his drawings, no writings, nothing but his drawingsCons: it only includes some of his drawings, is not a complete collection of all his drawings, but I am very pleased with the ones it contains. I love Dega's works but this edition is not worth $10 bucks."
2,"Rock-like Beans, Dull Flavor",I bought the Black Beans & Minestrone Soup cups for the auto-repair shop I work at. There's 22 guys & the ones who tried the two flavors I bought - didn't get it again. I'm a huge Black Beans & Rice fan but this brand was a bust. I found the beans stayed hard and the flavor was dull. Huge disappointment & tough to get rid of the last few cups (except to the unsuspecting).
5,Best money ever spent,"This DVD player is INCREDIBLE. Very versatile. Have used it on many, many road trips, and had peace (practically) the whole way. Only problem is finding extra screens for it. Other than that, A++++++!!!"
1,Outdated,This is an old book with outdated advice and obsolete information. Buy a more current book.
3,Black Pudding Review,"Received the black pudding yesterday. The dry ice had long ago evaporated and the pudding was only slightly cool to the touch.Tried it this morning. Similar to Irish version but a bit more bland. Also, it contains substantially less grain filler . Closer to Canadian blood sausage than to Irish Black Pudding. It will do when you can't get the real thing."
5,"Gorgeous, all color photo large-format review","This book is 5+ years old now, but it doesn't show it, besides possibly missing some of the most recent developments in the field - the book starts with a brief introduction to modernism, and moves quickly to the iconic photo of the felling of the Pruit Housing project in St. Louis- symbolizing the end of modernism. Post-modern examples quickly give way to the best of contemporary architecture around the world. As other reviewers have mentioned, gorgeous, ALL COLOR photographs in large format dominate this book, as any book about the visual and contextual aspects of architecture should. As another reviewer also points out, the writing is more critical art-historical than typical coffee-table book banter, and makes for a coherent review of architecture, who's size and strenth make it a piece of architecture itself. 5 stars - surprised I'm only the 10th reviewer."
2,Attention to detail,"The knife set is ok and will hopefully get the job done. For the price, however, they are really not very well made. The metal is barely finished, the wood is nothing special and the pins aren't even close to being flush with the handle. In short, they look like they were made in a hurry by someone on a friday afternoon, about 20 minutes from quitting time. If the knives were stamped with 'made in Pakistan' somewhere on them, I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Honestly, the price of these knives is not justified."
5,Enjoyable read,"This is a very enjoyable read. Sources are mentioned and research has clearly been done by the author to give as precise a historical account as possible, as much as can be known about an event that took place about 2400 years ago! But don't be dissuaded as this book is as precise as it's engrossing to the reader.The Salamis battle and all the background information leading up to it are very well explained. It is definitely worth reading."
1,A proof reader's train wreck!,"Mr. Fleming, did you not proof read this book prior to sending it to the publisher? It's truly a mess. There are so many, many typos, incomplete sentences and fragmented thoughts that it pains me to keep reading this book! You totally have so many blatant typographical mistakes that it's hard to believe that anything in the context could be truthful. How the heck did this get past the publisher? Names are spelled wrong from one sentence to the next sentence. People's occupations are in correct (Tony Martin is a singer, not a dancer) time frames are wrong (Ed Sullivan's TV show was in the 1950s, not the 1930s), some people are not explained at all (who is Cummings? First name? Occupation?). I just want to pull out a yellow highlighter, note all the mistakes and send this back to you! I'm so glad that I bought this book used because, had I spent $35.00, you can be sure that I really would send it back to you personally and ask for my money back."
5,Soft all over,I love these razor cartridges. I hate body hair and I use these to shave pretty much everywhere. These have been the best blades I've found for my sensitive skin. I shave often and these blades last longer than I expect blades to usually last and I rarely get nicks/cuts.
5,Great!,"I got these on amazon, simply because I was tired of waiting over 20 minutes in the store for someone to show up with the key to get them out of the case! However, They are a great product and last a LONG time! Love them!"
4,Does the job,"good price, considering what i'd pay for them in a pharmacy. they match any Venus razor handle, too. will buy again."
5,Gotta Love Those Veggies!,"My 3 year old is a big veggietale fan, but this was the first music that we purchased for her. She loves it. I specifically chose this one because it had music from her favorite video's, but I know there are other musical cd and cassette choices to pick from. We play them in the car and at home. Great songs and fun entertainment."
5,AAA+++,"Exactly a described. Excellent service, would definately buy from this seller again if needed. highly recommended. Please consider this seller. thanks for a great product. did scare me at first that there was not any dice in it, but upon closer inspection, found the dice. ha ha funny football dice. My grandson has to come to my house to play it the first time, and the game goes home with the winner. then the other will have to win it back."
3,"Great compilation,bad presentation.","I would be very interested to know if anyone out there who haspurchased this item feels as ripped off as I do.It's a great compilation BUT my copy is a cd-r!!!!I was gobsmacked after shelling out my hard earned dollars on what I thought would be a nice journey down memory lane only to be sent a cd-r and an inner sleeve that looks like a scanned photo copy.If you're just after the music,you can't go wrong,it's a great collection.Unfortunately the shoddy presentation lets it down.I'm that scared that the lacquer on the disc will scratch or the fine layer of foil the music is burnt on to(it's almost completely see through) will peel away that I will be making a backup copy to play.It's such a shame as Hot Records include a catalogue inside the cover however you would be wise to be warned.They sell cd-r's!"
3,Recycled Stories,"Byatt fans should note that four of these five fairy stories are taken directly from Possession (this book has been available in Europe for at least a year and a half). If you've read Possession, only the title story is new, which makes it hard to justify the $19 price. For hard-core Byatt fans, this may worthwhile, since the story is about half the length of the volume and is good stuff. If you haven't read Possession, I recommend that you read it instead of (or at least before) this collection. The stories are wonderful, and stand well on their own, but they are even better when read in the context of the novel"
3,wow!!,I really enjoyed this uplifting praise album. wow has come out with its series of albums....I enjoyed the blue one(the original one that started it all. I would recommend this as a keeper for the wow collection. I can't wait until the next album as well as the regualr album. It has a good mixture of classical as well as contemporary praise songs and it has serious as well as fast ones also.
5,Can't help loving any production of South Pacific,"Saw Mary Martin on Broadway, Mitzi Gaynor in the '58 movie, and this just makes my year. While purists may quibble, I'm just so happy that the wonderful music and themes of Rodgers and Hammerstein and that James Michener's ""Tales of the South Pacific"" are alive and appreciated by a new audience.Bought it and love it!"
4,The legendary power metallers' debut,"It's Accept's first album! While not as consistent as most of their other albums, this one still has plenty of great power metal riffs from Wolf & J√∂rg. Singer Udo Dirkschneider doesn't sing quite as good as he does on later albums, but even on this album he's one of the best rock singers ever. There are also a few songs where bassist Peter Baltes sings. There are some slower & more melodic songs here, but by the standards of slow songs, they're good. This album is essential for all Accept fans.""The Motor-saw was kindly given to us by Fichtel & Sachs"" - liner notes"
1,Get the DVD instead,"THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE AND POINTLESS CD.This is an expensive single disc CD. One side is music and the other side is enhanced so you can play the video on your computer. It is only 52 minutes long.This CD consists of the short songs from the complete concert that is featured on the DVD of the same name. This CD contains the lesser work from the concert. The only thing of interest on most of the songs, is that there is Randall Bramlett on saxophone.This show came just after guitartist Mike Howser died. George McConnell has just joined the band, but is so new, he is listed as a guest musician. He sounds out of place on most of the songs on this CD. He fits much better on the songs that were not included on the CD.Get the DVD instead. It has many great moments. The only real good song included on the CD is Rock."
4,Idael Health Care vs. Universal Health Care,"I learn that Ideal Health Care might be more effective than Univerisal Health Care. In addition, Manage Care & Single Payer Care have too many pit falls."
4,Good product,"Good product, nothing special. I recommend them if you need pants like this for working out, yoga, etc."
4,Elementary Edition Webster's New World Dictionary,"For an elementary dictionary, the Webster's New World Dictionary is quite comprehensive. Definitions are easier for a child to comprehend than typical dictionary definitions are."
1,whatever,"While I have not purchased this cd, I wonder why this soundtrack didn't include the following classic beef cuts:How you like me now - moe deeJack the ripper - LLThe bridge - shanThe bridge is ova - KrsI see the B**** in you - commom; directed at ice cubeHit um up - 2pacThe nas and jay-z beef cutsthat tim-dawg cut dissin comptonDre day - DreThere are others, but those stick out in my mind the most"
1,"Soap Opera, not Mystery","This is my first and last Earlene Fowler mystery. It read like a soap opera. Halfway through the book and still nothing but the mention of an old trunk and a 50 year old murder. I'm not going to bother finishing it. If I want a drama I'll choose one, but when I want a mystery I want clues, bodies, detecting, not a story about the main character dealing with her husband's affair!"
4,One of the Best Children's CD's Available. Quality Music,"This is one of the best children's music CD's you can buy. We have owned this CD for almost three months, and our children love a handful of the songs. You would have a hard time finding these songs anywhere else.About half of the songs are very good. One outstanding song is ""Baby Beluga"" by Raffi. ""Puff"" and ""Garden Song"" are instant classics, too. And a handful of the songs are not so good. It's a matter of taste.In that respect, this CD is similar to ""A Child's Celebration of the World,"" which has a handful of outstanding songs and a few clunkers. But both CD's are much better than the commercial music on the market. Your children will like these CD's.I also STRONGLY recommend anything by Raffi, such as ""Singable Songs for the Very Young"" or ""In Concert With the Rise and Shine Band."" Raffi's music is the best children's music of all time and highly recommended by educators."
4,"Good, not perfect","This is definitely a cut above most music for kids, and we often listen to it over dinner. The first half is EXCELLENT, with the original Puff the Magic Dragon, Danny Kay's Ugly Duckling, and an amazing, irresistable, Skip To My Lou. The garden song is lovely. The second half however, can be a bit lame. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is boooring, and Wynken Blynken and Nod is sung in a falsetto I actually find annoying. Jelly Man Jelly and Baby Beluga are OK, nothing special. So, yes I would buy it again. But be prepared to skip the lame bits and wonder why they couldn't have chosen better for these."
2,Guts in my opinion,I thought Guts was okay but there were some slow and boring parts of the book most of the time. I liked it when the moose attack happened and when he attracted almost all of the mosquitos in the country.
3,Guts,"in the beging gary tells alittle about him self. then goes on to say how his real life experiances affecet his writteing's towards the middel he tells about how he survives moose atackes and a plane crash after the piolet has a heart attack. towards the endhe tells how he attemps to eat guts and eyeballs just to se if it its humanly possible.""the situation is only as bad as you let it get""this story is set in minasota, and canada.the genre is auto biogaraphy.the problem is that gary paulsen tries to base all his writings on things that he has done and ibn doenig so he has gotten in to a lot of trouble.I would recomend this book to any one who likes gary paulsen books.I think that gary paulsen has a great writeng style."
5,A must read,This is a must read for any Paulsen fan. Boys will probably find it more interesting. Paulsen tells the true stories that inspired the actions in the Brian books--from crazy moose to monstrous mosquitoes. This was fascinating reading because it was TRUE!
1,Disney has changed the songs invarious ways,"I bought both lion king and the Princess CDGs and the songs that are on these are not the right words nor are they a likable sorce of instrumentals for any vocalist to sing. These are not the memory of the children's cartoon versions that the children see .I thought if i bought them in the disney version they would be the proper versions, I was looking for the hits not changed versions."
1,disney karaoke,"Like others from Disney, I seldom hear my granddaughters playing this. They expected a version ""straight from the movie."" It isn't."
5,Comfort,"For anyone with hammer toes, I highly recommend this product. The only way I can wear closed shoes is to cut these bandages to size for my toes. Really takes the pain and rubbing away."
2,A bit disappointing,"I purchased this activity book as a supplement for my 7th grade Language Arts class. It is somewhat disappointing. It was published in 1990, but looks like it was published much earlier, as the type font and layout look like 1970's or 1980's typed manuscript, and the illustrations are also old-fashioned. It is full of jokes, riddles, and games, but little academic review and practice. There are a few ""nuggets"" I can use, such as ""Interesting Etymologies,"" and ""Common Roots & Affixes."" However, you have to wade through a lot of less useful material to find something truly useful. In my opinion, not worth purchasing."
4,Great for the LA teacher,"If you're new to teaching Language Arts, need a fresh approach, or just needing to concentrate more on it this is a good book to have in your arsenal.I used this to be a guide in writing a more cross curriculum specific plan."
4,Queensryche...matured and older,I got this disc because of the 'Mindcrime Suite'. I was curious to see how they would perform. I personally would have wanted the entire Mindcrime lp to be performed but a medley will do. Has anyone noticed that track 17 'My empty room' is not credited on the disc or the package? I enjoyed what I heard but I do think that the 'Live Mindcrime' is the better performance. Sound quality is very good but the loss of the original guitarist shows.
3,Not Impressed,"I was hoping for more in this book. I think it is an OK resource, but there are better ones out there."
1,Not much for real content,You really wont learn much about leadership from this expensive tome. Its just a compilation of short sketches about people who are known for leadership. Nothing in depth at all. I regret having spent the money on this book. I should have looked it over more closely before buying it.
5,VIVA DEBORAH!,"It's been a long time since Debbie Gibson appeared in the music scena. Now, not a teenager anymore, she keeps on writing and performing better than ever, in a more adult way. This album is totally awesome (as her previous, ""Deborah"" was too). I love all the songs, especially ""Jaded"", which I play all the time, as well as ""MYOB"", ""What You Want"" ""Your Secret"" and ""He likes me in Blue"". I only wish we didn't have to wait so long from one album to another, but being this the result, it's been worth the wait."
1,Not an original AA lotion,The lotion does not have any fragrance compared to the original AA lotion I used to purchased at Amazon. I hope the seller will stop this kind of activity. I will contact the AA company and probably will send a bottle of what purchased
2,Should've Been A CD Single,"Two great dance songs (""Get Off"" and ""Hot Number"") surrounded by tepid disco slush do not make a Greatest Hits album. What's sad is that Foxy didn't take the formula they created with ""Get Off"" and run with it on later albums. It would've been far more interesting."
2,Rev SUCKS,That conis whack.Just Moving around the controller will affect the games movements. I aint playing Socom just moving the controller and pressing to shoot. what happens when you turn around?Huh? did nintendo think of that? Im still buying 360 and PS3. Oh by the way did you see MGS4? Its cool.
5,pretty good,"ok alot of ""dumb"" kids are posting here and whining that the DS sucks because they couldn't buy one. Anyways the only complaint i have about this system is picochat is useless since you have to be within 100 feet but i use it during high school (not to cheat) but to chat when im bored and teacher wont let us talk. overall i think the graphics and sound are greatits a little hard to hold stylus and DS at same time but thats what the thumb stylus is for.I live in a small rural town and the local target here still has 3 from its initial shipment (i called today) so it was no problem getting one.Beware:buy a game with this one. the metroid demo gets old in 1-2 weeksgood games:feel the magic xx/xymadden nfl 2005"
1,Tommy,"The Nintendo DS came to me very soon but it does not look ""good"" as it should be. The screen and the body of the Nintendo were very worn out, scratched and I already returned it to the Seller..."
1,yup...mmm hmm,"psp conquers this thing.psp has sold over a million units in japan and they sold 700000 or 800000 units on the day it was relesed there. ds will obviously beat the ps2 right now cuz every1 either has a ps2 or an xbox...no gamecubes...nintendo screwed up with that. wut im saying is anyone who buys a ds is getting ripped off. psp has an amazing screen..web browser..mp3..mp4/movies and full games not some crap flash game that only takes 2 secs to load becuase the game isnt that big and there is only like 2 levels. plus play yan is junk i mean ds already has bad pixel resolution, play yan will just get the mp3s and mp4s to work on it, doesnt mean its gonna be good. and i HIGHLY doubt that theres an emulator for graphics."
2,SD card is nothing but garbage.,What makes you think Ds can compete with PSP with that trash. Nintendo Has a long and long way to go with PSP and by that time comes Microsoft will have a hand held better than Nintendo of course.
5,The coolest handheld in the history of the world!,"I got one for Christmas and it is the absolute coolest handheld ever! There are 13 buttons, 1 switch(volume),and last but absolutely not least, a Touch Screen! I would rate it higher than 5, but I can't. To summarize that, IT ROCKS!!!!"
5,original D S,"I chose this rating because my 12 year old grandson loves this system.The PROS:you can play gameboy games as well as D S games it's also wifi enabled and there are a WHOLE LOT of games for this.CONS: about the only accessories you can find for this are the chargers, stylus, and I think thats about it.. I have asked at game stores and walmart and best buy about cases and nerf cases and they all told me you can't find things like that for the D S anymore.$50.00 is a bit much for an item you can't find protective cases or any cases for that matter. D S lite cases are a tad small the D S barely fits and there is no place for the cord but it serves it's purpose."
1,not so good,"I own a DS and a PSP. The DS is a bit more affordable but the PSP is just amazing, there is no comparison the DS is big, it's dual screen is confusing, while the PSP has a huge screen... it's just the perfect machine mp3, videos (even though the DS says it has these capabilities they are really bad and the speakers suck!So if you were thinking about buying a DS don't waste money buy a PSP instead"
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"The Nintendo DS is one of the most rushed and terrible products on the market now. The two screens are a gimmic and most of the games fail to use the lower screen in any breakthrough ways. The graphics can be compared with PS1 games circa 1996-1997. When I first saw the DS i knew it wasnt going to be very good. Now I know that. All the games have been rushed and lack polish. Nintendo has not announced a must-buy game for the DS yet. If you are considering purchasing a portable console and you are over the age of 10 buy the PSP. This console has near PS2 quality graphics, anybody who says the DS has better graphics is just plain retarded. DS catridges hold 1/14 the storage of UMDs which the PSP uses, and the processor is no where near the quality of the PSPs. I have used the DS and it is awful. If you happen to recieve one of these consoles return it and wait for the PSP. The two screens are a gimmick and in fact the console is one of the worst inventions in the 21st century."
1,WHY!!!???,"ok, I recently tried nintendo DS. the touch thing is cool and all but the games suck! unlike other nintendo systems, the games don't have any plot what so ever! their boring pointless mini games! nuff said! this system stinks! why nintendo!?"
2,"look, I bought one, so I know what it is like","I am not saying that the DS is bad. Its very good, and the touch screen is great, but Super Mario was the only good game they had. Most of the games don't even use the touch screen. It is a good system, but not close to as good as the PSP. The PSP has a UMD software, so you can put movies on it, its screen is huge, and the games have better graphics, and better game play. I bought a DS, and sold it in 3 months. I bought it in Japan, and it was a dissapointment, so I sold it to get a PSP. I have seen them before, and played them, so if you would rather have better, and less childish games, buy the PSP. Most of the people who are writing good reviews probably bought the DS, and can't afford the PSP, so they are denying that the PSP is better. Take my advice, don't buy a DS"
1,horendous,"MY REVIEWGames~ 3/10 DS has really bad games our right now, the only good ones are the poker ones, we all like a freindly game of cards dont we??Game quality~ 4/10 Games can be beaten in about twenty minutes, and who says they cant fit more game data on a UMD than a cartridge, you no you are wrong so just admit it.Geek features~ 4/10 WiFi and pictochat, thats it. Pictochat is pretty cool but the WiFi stinks ive seen samples of it and since the DS doesnt even have a main menu you it will be pretty awkward.Hmmmmm........4+4+3=11 11/3=about 3.6 so 3.6= 1.8 stars. Ill still give it a oneBy the way im not sony fanboy I just want people to get it straight."
1,I was expecting more,"I don't think this is a very good system as everyone says it is, I mean I think the SP is better since the cuality is better and is twice cheaper than th DS. I mean i was waiting for nintendo's new release but when I saw it for the first time it was very dissapoinment (or however you spell it), the systeme looks pretty amazing but its shape and size isn't that cool, SP is way smaller than the DS. The graphics and the picto-chat are one of the things that saved this system. Another bad thing is the realesed games, there's like only 6. Come on nintendo, I hope you do better in your next system."
5,I love this thing,"Best handheld on the market right now. Definitely recommended to all gamers who don't care whether or not they can play movies and mp3s on their system. This is about GAMING, isn't it? It should be."
3,People get a grip,"Okay this isnt a review it is a statement to all Nintendo fans, now don't get me wrong Nintendo is a great company wich makes great games, and systems, I even own a GBA, and also a PS2, but all this ""we need to ban together to stop the PSP"" is Bologna,I think the DS is a good system, though I don't own it, but the PSP will most likely beat Nintendo, because of all the awesome extras you get with the PSP, and the superior graphics, though the DS's graphics are very good especially because it comes on a very small cartridge, but the PSP's graphics are similar to first generation PS2 Graphics.I dont want to make enemies, but I believe, and this is just my opinion that the PSP is better, and will beat Nintendo.If someone offered me one of these systems for free I would Probebly choose the PSP. Sorry"
4,"Better than the PSP, But not perfect.","First off, I'd like to say what is good and what is not so good.Good-*Very well balanced system*Very, VEry, VERy, VERY fun games*Easy interface*Backward compatibility*Wireless featuresNOT so good-*Long setup process*In PictoChat, touch screen is not always accurate*Sheer bulkBy the way, I am only thirteen years of age, But I outspell and outgrammar my dad.In other words, for a good gaming experience, look no further than the NDS. The system also good if size doesn't matter."
3,PSP DS WAR,"I have looked at the PSP and the DS reviews. They both target one another when the truth is you cant compare the 2. Yes the DS is cheeper and you can talk to people with the sweet tough sreen but for $100 more you can get the internet,a MP3 player,a movie player and a gameing sytem. your pick depends on your wallet and your computer, if you have a bad computer then dont get it."
1,"Nintendo, what gives?","Bought this, had it for about two months. Mario was ok. Asphalt rocked. and Ridge Racers sucks. The reason I sold it is the gimmick wore off as soon as the psp was released. Rather than get get to work promoting a new handheld. Nintendo decides to release a gameboy micro?? I'd rather have my sp thinks. That's 3 different gba's if you don't count the fact that the two new systems have backlit screens. Oh and most gba games look washed out on the screen. Not my cup of tea."
5,Wiked Sweet,I love this toy. it's way better than the PSP. the PSP stinks.It's the worst toy ever. I read a rieview it's crap. I swear the DS is the best toy ever. theres 2 screens 1.regular 2.touch screen. remember this the PSP sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
1,Woa.,"DS's power is nowhere near The GCN. Not even near PSP and PS2, what is this kid saying? DS uses cartridges and GCN uses miniCD's, what are you talking about?The graphics arent even near that. PSP is the revolution and DS is Not.THE Revolution is just a DErevolution and 360 is the REvolution. Ignore Nintendo and look at Microsoft."
1,Tsk...Tsk....Tsk....,"PSP is a MUCH better deal than DS. I would go into detail but I am too busy playing my PSP. Bare with the PSP's price and in the long run, it IS better.P.S.I am writing this review from my PSP's web browser"
5,DS colors exclusive on japan... only 2,"That's right. Like happened with nintendogs, on november 28, nintendo is going to relase a nds bundle that includes a red nds (hot rod red), the first Nintendo game to take advantage of Nintendo free Wi-Fi Connection, mario kart ds, a checkered-flag wrist strap and a series of racing-inspired decals to let owners customize their rides with sporty numbers or red-hot flames. for more information, go to this website:(...)"
5,I love how the games are all reasonably priced,"$25-30 for most games... not bad. Unlike the PSP which can be nearly double that. The DS has great graphics, don't be misled by anyone. Check out meteos if you think the DS graphics suck. Plus, the games are what makes hte system, and Nintendo has always had a very high standard for their games. Trust in a company that's been around in the gaming world for over 20 years! Nintendo rules!"
5,Great System!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great game system. It is so fun and makes your eyes glued to the screens. The touch screen is nice and I have had no problems with it. And the graphics are stunning. It is much better than the PSP since it doesn't brake as easy. I have dropped my DS on concrete many times and it doesn't bake. If you have already bought the game and are wondering what game you should get I would recommend Mario Kart or Super Mario 64 DS! This system is much better than a Game Boy Advance because of the graphics, touch screen, games, WIFI, pictochat, and the multiplayer system. I totally recommend this for everyone."
1,Hah... what a bad system,"Wow... this thing is so bad. I borrowed my friend's to give it a try and I felt like a girl fiddling with her palm pilot. Not only are the ds' graphics horrible, it is annoying using the micro-sized stylus (which I might add is smaller than a pencil in diameter). Honestly, I was cracking up at how bad it was - with the kiddie games and all - ***IF YOU ARE A DS FAN THAT WON'T READ THE REST OF WHAT I'M SAYING, JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE NOW*** How does metroid compete with games like Metal Gear or how does rogue agent event come near the soon coming GTA game? And tell me... how many rated M games are there for the ds? And just for the record... why do you need the ds to chat to someone?? can't you just take some steps forward? I mean you cant get fat playing that pile of garbage all day let alone 2 seconds... Overall the DS is no more than a portable SNES + a built in paperclip feature"
3,"This stinks on ice!, a bit","I have a DS. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it 5. It needs more games and features. It needs wireless for GBA games, and more games. If you have a DS, sell it and use that money to buy a GBA SP. Or keep it."
5,Outstanding handheld by the leader in handheld gaming.,"Sure the PSP is all shiny and new, with great graphics, but it is yet unproven in my mind. Given time though it could become a real power house... but on to the DS.The DS shines in its backwards compatability which adds hundreds of outstanding GBA games. Fire Emblem, four Zelda games, three Metroid games, and Final Fantasy I and II to just name a few. Being able to play classic NES games on a portable is beyond a price.The DS games are not as plentiful as GBA games as of this time but give it some time and the quality games will be growing on trees.Games such as Castlevania DS, Metroid Prime DS, Final Fantasy III (which has never been released in the US0, Secret of Mana, Fire Emblem, Zelda DS, and a host of others will make the DS the handheld of the next few years."
3,From a left-handed gamer,"The Nintendo DS is a great handheld system in most aspects including gameplay, games, compatibility, multiplayer, and innovation but lacks in one area. That is the user compatibility for left-handed gamers. How the controls and stylus are set up i found it hard to play with the stylus, and felt myself going back to the gameboys with nothing new to do with my hands. How the DS is set up, the directional buttons are on the left side, and the stylus is to be used in the right hand to shoot, write, etc, and that is very difficult for me. The DS was made considering that the majority of the population is right-handed, and can be difficult for others. I like the DS, with all its features, and have to get used to the right-handed stylus, but I am sure that I will be able to use it better in the future."
5,The best ever,"hi i am 13 teen but am useing kids reveiw, I just got the ds on1/27/06, and have not seast from playing it is so cool, get this you can play multi player with just one game, the host has the game, then presses multi player game, the other player have a mode on menu screen ds multi player game, they click it and it searches for people whaiting for malti player game, the ds is cool get this, you can even send messeges to each other,with the ds chatroom internet free only nintendo ds users talk in the chat room within 50-70 feet away. this is cool i love it and you will to please bye ow ya one more thing if you read my review and buy the ds, leave a reveiw thats says thanx-and whare you live. ps i might live neare you to play with you"
4,DS vs. PSP,"Alright, I'm sure anyone reading this has already read the other reviews that compare the DS and the PSP, so I'm just going to give the basic line. If you can afford the PSP, get it because it has better games, features, and graphics. However, if you're not willing to spend the $250 on the Playstation Portable, the DS will fill your handheld needs just fine. It will be even a better substitute if some good games start coming out for it."
4,reply,"Even if you can play ds games on the psp, with no touch screen it wouldn't be very fun for many games (Examples: Meteos, Kirby Canvas Curse). If you had bothered to read all of that person's review, you would notice that it says many games cannot or should not be played without a touch screen.And a comment how much do the memory sticks for the PSP cost? A flashcard for the DS holds about 256-512 MB. It costs more than the ds game to buy (and keep) the game on psp memory sticks."
2,GET THE DS LITE,There is a differance between DS and DS Lite. Except that the DS Lite screen is brighter and has 4 settings of brightness. The original has one setting of brightness and not as bright as the Lites. Not even the lowest setting of the brightness in the DS Lite is brighter than the original DS.The DS lite is much more smaller and much more comfortable to hold than the original. The original has a pretty bad desighn. The lites has and awsome desighn.
4,You all need to grow up...,"I mean seriosly, arguing over two systems on a page meant for REVIEWS only is about as pathetic as it gets. Looks at yourselves, you all screaming at each other and telling the other virtulally the same thing they are saying to you.I'm actually considering getting some popcorn, kicking back in my chair, and watching you all go at it. No, seriously, Grow up and start making authentic reviews, or take it elsewhere.Now then, now for my review, The DS is an awesome system. While it may not measure up to the PSP in terms of graphics or media features, its still a cool system. The 2nd/touch screen make playing games a much more interesting experience.And the upcoming Wi-Fi service will take multiplayer gaming to a whole new level. If you like the GBA or any past hand held, get this system!"
4,Nintendo at its best,"I have had a PSP since its launch, and I just bought a Nintendo DS this weekend. So far, I am very satisfied with it. Graphics wise, it is impressive but the PSP fares better. However, it is the games that separate the PSP and DS. The DS, quite simply, has better games at the moment than the PSP, especially with Advance Wars DS coming out in a few days. If you have played the other Advance Wars, I am sure you would agree that they were extremely fun, and I will bet money that the DS version will at least be as good, if not better, than the originals.I still have faith in Sony and the PSP, but as of now, the DS seems like the better choice, especially after the difference of the DS being $150 and the PSP at a alarming $250."
5,one awesome system!!!!,"i have nothing against sony, and I own a ps2, but the ds is gonna be way better than the psp! the first wireless game system that uses touch screen abilities to play the game. nintendo really outdid themselves this time! so what if you can play movies on the psp,i'd reccomend this to any experienced gamer.(no offence to sony)"
1,This thing [...]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,First off nintendo ds is a horrible system. You people who like ninteno ds must hate good grahics. I played this at my friends house and i was bord of it 10 seconds later. Psp is a wonderful system. Best graphics ever!!!!! You couldn't ask for a better system. I don't have either system's but i have played them. I'm getting a psp this christmas. I have to admit at first i couldn't get a psp and was going to get a ds. But i deffinatley changed my mine when i could get one. If you ask me get a psp.p.s.Nintendo ds screen gets scrated because you use the stylus.
3,Nintendo DS (Does Suck),"I am a DS and a PSP owner,but i hate to break this to me, all the Nintendo fans and DS owners, PSP is way much better than DS. PSP has much more features than DS, like psp can play movie, music and display photo(but more expensive).The only feature I like on Ds is Pictochat and longer battery, but i can't bring it with me to China cause this stupid thing won't charge unless i can change the output to 120v.So Nintendo fans, try PSP for a change if u have more than$250, and if not try other systems like Xbox360 or PS3(not nintendo rev.)."
5,do not think the psp fanboy is good i do not like sony so nintendo get your pitch forcks,SONY STINKS THERE TRYING TO MAKE nintendo LOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Dude... the DS rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No, I'm only kidding. The DS is so dumb. I have all the DS games and they are all stupid. I think the GBA games are way better. Oh yeah and you know the touch screen, they give you a tiny pen for it and it's so small compared to it on T.V. so they are totally ripping you off. All they added was the touch screen but other than that, it's pretty much the same thing as the SP. And plus, it only comes in one color. Ugly silver. The price just went over the line. At least for me. Trust me, don't buy it ever in your life."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this mini refrigerator to keep our office medications in and the handle broke the second time we opened it. It is cute but a very poor design. Don't waste your money.
1,Spend your money on a tarp,"I bought this because I thought it would be good match to my new tent. It was in size but in durability your better off buying a roll of trash bags and laying them out on the ground. That is what this amounts to. The material might be 4mil plastic at best. Do yourself a favor and buy a good old blue tarp that fits your size tent and fold over the edges if necessary. This thing does nothing but keep the dirt off the bottom of the tent, punched holes through it immediately after placing it on the ground and kneeling on it to speread out the tent. Mine is now going to be used as a drop cloth for painting."
2,Ancient and not extremely useful,"This book was written over 60 years ago, and its contents really show it. The condition of the book itself is terrible, and the pages smell like something out of my grandmother's attic. As far as the content itself, the pronunciation key is somewhat inaccurate and the writing system is not taught at all. The grammatical explanations are difficult to understand. I'd recommend you definitely skip this one and try ""Teach Yourself Nepali"" instead. You'll be glad you did."
1,a bit too much anger,"Ok - I can understand being upset about a girlfriend cheating. You can be mad and curse all you want, but when others have to hear that anger and cursing, then it sounds like a problem. Gee... why is it that that kids nowadays are disrepectful, vulgar, and lack morals? It's because of this mainstream garbage that they are practically forced to listen to.Venting anger through songwriting is fine... but leave the potty mouth language inside a personal diary."
2,Way too much cussing,"The beginning of the song is so good, but then every other word out of his mouth is a swear word. The song would have been so much better if he would just stop swearing. There are other ways to articulate your feelings. Plus he has the worst voice!!"
1,If only I could give it less than 1 star ...,"I have noticed that the folks who rate this song highly seem to think that those of of who hate it are hung up on the profanity. NOT SO!! Here is why I think this is the worse piece of crap to hit the airwaves in a very long time.1)The lyrics - All it took to write this song was a rhyming dictionary and five minutes of free time. Lyrically this is the most banal, vapid tune I have ever heard.2) The music - An overproduced, pedestrian, meandering mess.3) The Singer - One of the thinnest voice on the planet (Sounds like Keith Sweat with a massive headcold).I could care less about the profanity, Rock and Rollers and Rappers have been mining that field for quite some time, and to some degree the profanity used actually make the song. Profanity or not, THIS is just one big ass train wreck of a song"
5,Great Song,"After being in a relationship that sounds a lot like the one in this song, I think the words to it are great. Yes they are extreme, but he says what you really feel. When you just got screwed over by some girl you want to call them names and curse. You can feel this guy's pain. So well written."
2,Horrible song.,"What the hell is this crap? This song is terrible! This guys voice is terrible, it makes me cringe. And its not the cursing makes me mad, its just a crappy song, with terrible vocals.Don't buy the single...the song is horrible."
1,1 star is too much,His voice is so annoying. He sounds like a mouse trying to sing like justin timberlake. The song is even more annoying then his voice. I don't know how this boy got a record deal cause he can't sing.
2,Difficult to understand,"This book is a requirment for the nursing program I am in and I find it hard to understand for a nursing student who is just starting out. You dont get the answers in the back of the book, no rationales. I am currently looking for a med-surg book that is easier to read in order to really understand the content. This book isnt it."
4,Perfect gift for 40th wedding anniversary,"We purchased this ""ruby slipper"" for my in-law's 40th wedding anniversary. My mother in-law loved it!"
2,have not tried....safety concerns...,"I try to research cat products before committing to them. I found the following statement on this site: [...]-'The NRDC's report lists flea- and tick-control products marketed under the following major brand names that have been found to contain OPs: Alco, Americare, Beaphar, Double Duty, Ford's Freedom Five, Happy Jack, Hartz, Hopkins, Kill-Ko, Protection, Rabon, Riverdale, Sergeant's, Unicorn, Vet-Kem, Victory, and Zema. To protect their pets and children, consumers should consult with a veterinarian before purchasing any over-the-counter (OTC) products.'-As such, I'm not going for the vet kem flea collar at this point. Hopefully, I willl come across documentation that indicates that it is safe. If so, I will update my comment here accordingly."
5,Good value and fast shipping,Used on our 12 cats. Just wish it had a area for fasting a tag instead of looping around the collar. Protection seems to work well with no fleas or ticks on the pets. Third year ordering. Always use a break away type collar for your cat's life. Lost one for not having it.
5,works well,I have seven cats who go outside in a rather woodsy area and they stay flea and tick free with this product.
5,Understanding EKGs: A Practical Approoach (2nd Edition),Excellent Product--Very well written with ample practice and questioning techniques. Highly Recommended for gaining a strong basis in this field.
3,Good but very basic,"I enjoyed this book, but it is VERY basic. Good explanations but won't take you very far. I'll keep the book for a basic review or illustration to show others.If you are looking for a similarly basic book, you may also try Gail Walraven'sBasic Arrhythmias (6th Edition)in addition to this book. Walraven's book gives many more sample ECG strips for practice. And, it is similarly priced.After reading these books, you could try Huzar'sBasic Dysrhythmias: Interpretation and Management - Text and Pocket Reference Package (Revised Reprint)which is more advanced and takes you into much more detail."
5,Understandable,Easy explination of the heart's processes and how they relate to what is on paper. Comprehensable approach to translation of rhythms.
5,Christian music: Sara Groves,"Sara Groves is incredibly insightful for such a young person! Her songs in ""Conversations"" are sweet, deep & soulful. In this particular CD she sings my heart. For the past year it has been by far my favorite CD."
2,Tight Fit but Weak Clip,"I bought this item for my 2nd gen. black Nano. The casing is well made, clear, and fits very well. It is a comfortable tight fit that holds the Nano securely. However, the belt clip component itself is poorly designed and lacks enough force to hold on to a belt or pants. The clip also lacks internal teeth needed for a tighter grip.Consider buying this item if you want the clear casing to protect your Nano from scratches. Otherwise, if you use the clip, the whole thing is going to fall out and possibly damage both the casing and your Nano."
4,iPod clear acrylic case,"Overall, I am pleased with this product. It does a good job of protecting the iPod nano and easily clips onto anything (clothing, purse, etc.). The touch wheel is easy to access while it's in the case, and the headphone jack is also easily accessible. I take my iPod in and out of the case almost daily (to use in a speaker system) and the case has held up fine. A few scratches have appeared due to use, but considering the price I am very pleased!"
1,Not worth the money,This book was designed to go with a training seminar. It has very limited usefulness on its own. Key pieces of information are left blank to be filled in during a class/seminar. Would not recommend.
2,Taj has done much better - CD is not a very good value,"I have been a Taj Mahal fan for many years. I love just about everything he has put out and when we had a kid I rushed out to buy this album. I found it disappointing !First of all, with only ten songs, none of which are very long, the playtime is rather short. There is still good material on the album much of it re-runs of his standards - like fishing blues with a little bit of added narrative which is not all that meaningful.Some of the songs sound like he used a drum machine.I really think your money is better spent on an album like ""Giant Step"" the kids won't care that it wasn't made specifically for children."
1,This Cd Sucks.,"I have never been a huge Taj Mahal fan, and this Cd is what completely turned me off him. Plus kids don't want to hear all the lectures and sanitized music, they want to hear the real thing. When I was a kid I grew up listening to Chris Smither and he never did any childrens stuff. So just get your kid the real thing"
1,wonder why others gave it 5 stars...,Brave Irene is a story about a little girl who risks her life to deliver a fancy dress to a royal in a snowstorm. Irene suffers terribly to do so. I do not think this is a good thing! I have a little girl and I would never allow her to put herself in danger for a stupid dress. I bought this book because of the other reviews...and because I also own Pete's a Pizza... a much better book by William Steig.
5,"Soft soup, not chunky and satisfying","Not as spicy as some of the other flavors. Creamy. Not chunky = less filling. Great with a slice of bread. Since this flavor tasted less spicy, I'm more likely to eat it if I'm feeling sick."
2,Too sweet for my tastes,"I had this book recommended to me, and although it's well written, it's too sweet and saccharine for my tastes. I prefer my heroines feistier, my plots more adventurous and my heroes with more edge.But if you like books abut heroines who manage to coax little girls to speak, doing more for them in a few minutes than anyone else has been able to do in years, then you'll probably like this book."
5,WOW!!! What CAN'T I Say?,"This entire CD is absolutely WONDERFUL! I've purchased three myself, two of which are autographed by this talented singer/songwriter. (I gave two away but I did my part to help!)If you're looking for a good time, pick up this CD and crank it up! There are almost an equal number of slow and up-tempo songs, all of which are sure to be number one hits!Even if you're new to country music, you'll enjoy his current hit, ""Walk a Little Straighter"" which really speaks to so many people as well as ""Where The Girls Are"" which is just a great, fun-loving song! ""Growing Up Down There"" is really going to make you wish you grew up ""down there""! I could keep going but they only allow 1000 words so I must stop myself now!!!Pick up your copy today and find out for yourself!!!Hey, if you still need some time to decide to actually purchase this wonderful CD, visit Billy's website (www.billycurrington.com) and take a listen for yourself!"
1,Very Disappointed,"When I attached the first pot knob, it broke right away. The second pot knob is wobbly. I am very disappointed with this product."
4,Perfect,I bought the rotating sprinkler but needed extra hose so I could place the sprinkler further away to get the yard watered completly.
4,prosa-forte,"Jean Harris's territory is the psychology of the couple--its gaps and attractions,its pains and revelations. Intelligently hermetic, she negotiates souls. Diffidenceis a m√©lange of air and stone, strength and vulnerability. Powerful and sensitiveat the same time, the novel squeezes destinies in one cup of prosa-forte that youwant to swallow sip by sip thinking of lost love and conquered vanities."
2,Sump Pump,The float sticks most of the time....can't stand it...will replace it shortly....waste of money. Would not recommend this product.Thank you.
5,Wife loves them!,Bought these for my wife as she was complaining all her old socks had holes in them. She loves em' and seem to be made pretty good.
2,"OK for small stuff, in a pitch dark room","This projector will work for you if you are only projecting small images in a totally dark room. At larger magnification distances, the image becomes very blurry, unsaturated, and distorted, not to mention that it has to be pitch black to actually see the image, which you will be squinting to make out. The 6"" max paper size also too small for anything complex, and the sides fall off significantly in brightness and focus.My recommendation to anyone who will be using this to blow up images (I used it for paintings), is to get an overhead projector instead. I can't believe I struggled with this thing for two years, when an overhead will give you an incredibly straighter, brighter, and sharper image. If you are worried that making transparencies is going to be a pain, almost all inkjet printers will make a beautiful transparency if you get decent quality film (the Inkpress transparency film works really well on my Epson)."
5,"Fantastic. A ""must read"" for any aspiring mathematician.","This book examines the lives of women mathematicians from antiquity to the present. Osen describes the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of some of history's most fascinating people with a perspective no male could bring to the subject. I'd love to discuss the matter with the author."
5,Marvelous Words For Lee Lessack,"Lee Lessack has a beautiful voice. He has shown us that on his previous recordings. Can he also be funny? Absolutely. Is he smart? You better believe it! This live CD is a must for all cabaret lovers and music lovers in general. It is the perfect combination of song, singer and delightful details about the composer, Johnny Mercer, possibly the greatest songwriter in the Great American Songbook. Do yourself a favor...If you're a fan like I am, buy it. This one's a keeper!"
5,For the mystery lovers in us all...,"Before ""Destination Truth"", ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Finding Bigfoot"", Leonard Nimoy took us (well, those of us who were alive in the 70s) on a weekly 30-minute journey through the paranormal and mysterious. I wasn't sure how well this would hold up 30 years later, but it's still one of the best series of its kind out there. While I love all these new shows, being a long time lover of things strange and beyond belief, I tend to get as caught up in the personalities as much as the investigation itself. Mr. Nimoy adds a great sense of class and unbiased presentation which draws you in to each episode. I rarely drop more than $100 on any DVD package, but this was well worth it!"
1,In Search of Science,"""The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies, and in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer...is no."" - Leonard Nimoy [The Simpsons, Springfield Files]Perhaps if the show aired with the above disclaimer it would be clear that the show is anti-reason, anti-science, and anti-skeptisism . . . still . . . you gotta laugh."
5,works for me,"exactly what i had been looking for. funny how it shouldny have worked on my computer according to one review:""You need to have your computer installed with the following: Operating System: Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, Software: Active Server Pages 2.0 or higher (included with IIS), Apple QuickTime Player (included with IIS), Microsoft CDONTS (included with the Option Pack), Microsoft Data Access Components 2.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 or higher, Microsoft XML Parser 3.0 or higher (included with the Data Access Components), MySQL 3.23 or higher (included on this CD-ROM), Real Networks Real Video Player.So, if you do not have NT4 or Windows 2000 on your computer, are you ready to make the change?? Think before you buy this book.""worked just fine on my iMac. Running 9.2 inside OS-X. just though that some people might appreciate having this pointted out."
5,Still a Favorite 6 Years after first purchase!,"I first purchased this cassette as a Young Teacher working in Early Childhood Education. The Music for Little People's Series has never failed me, and I love reggae. Many years later, this is still a favorite of mine, and now my daughter's (almost 2)and of My Center's ( 111 children at a NAEYC accreditated facility!) I have tested it on Hundreds of children ages 6 weeks through 6 Years and always seen swaying happy children enjoying the music. You can't go wrong with this one!"
3,Good CD.. not great,I may be just a tad biased when it comes to reviewing this CD considering I was in the play earlier this year.. The vocals these kids have are okay at best.. Some just are plain out annoying.. However.. The CD is good if your a fan of the movie.. Or if you were in the play and need some kind of momento to remember it by.. If you havent really associated with either the play of the Movie i cant really recomend you buy it..
5,Best chocolate-peanut combination EVER!,"Finding Brach's Peanut Clusters has been a nightmare! After driving to many different stores in different locations without success, I decided to try the internet to see if the product was available or if it had been discontinued. To my GREAT SURPRISE, I was able to order several packages from Amazon.com.YOU MADE MY DAY and the candy is more delicious than I remember!"
2,torn paper,I ordered this as a present and when I got it the packaging was already opened and the paper was all over the box. Most of the paper was crinkled and torn. The paper is good and that's why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.
4,good paper -nice price,"Very good price on a large quantity of paper that's the same color on both sides - not super quality(kind of thick, but very foldable and square). Gorgeous colors!"
2,cheap and disappointing,"Be aware this is not shiny origami paper with 2 sides. It may be good for practice, but is pulpy and tears easily."
2,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Silver Screen Showcase, NOT","Bahhumbug why bother...even at the bargin price I sometimes wish I hadn't took a purchase plunger with this one. Looking at a slim silver lining, I can see my chest fill slightly...~~~Merrily Mix 1#, 3#, 4#, 6$, 8#, and 9#1\2 ~~~ Post Script:Collector Clutter...YULEridGEMality Factor = 2"
5,Before Its Time,This movie has all the hard-hitting schemes of executives now - but it was made long ago. I would liken it to Wall Street.
2,Not a whole lot here to get excited about,"I was not familiar with D.C. Larue before purchasing this CD. I had heard only his awesome song entitled, ""Overture"" - truly a disco great - but there's nothing on this that comes close to it's excitement and fun (the closest second is ""So much for L.A."" The rest of the songs seems to be tediously similar to each other.Disappointing."
3,Argent - 'Encore: Live In Concert' (Collectables),"Originally released in 1974, 'Encore: Live In Concert' has never been considered to be all that great of a live album. In fact, it's pure mediocre. However, it does have a few highlights throughout it's 78 minute duration. Whew! That's a long disc there. The few cuts that I thought more or less made the disc worth hanging onto (at least to me) were ""Music From The Spheres"", the eleven minute refreshing ""Hold Your Head Up"" and their rendition of The Zombie's ""Time Of The Season"". Fairly recent, I ran into keyboardist / songwriter Rod Argent while he was on tour with former Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone and he was telling me that to this day, Argent reforms now and again with all five original members to usually play benefit concerts. I firmly believe that Argent could most likely sound better than 'Encore' at a present day live gig."
4,good product.,"A good product, but has a slight noisy hum. I can't say much more to accurratly describe the product it does it's job."
2,Too hot to use,I was excited to use this device but cannot use it because it's too hot for my skin. I tested it out first on my arm and it was burning hot! My mother tested it out on her arm but felt fine. Luckily it came with a 30 day money back guaranteed. If your skin is sensitive to heat don't have high hopes for Zeno.
1,junk,I'm in my mid twenties and this product did nothing to treat new pimples....its also way over priced. I returned it after a week.
3,Not made for cystic acne...,"Apparently it works for some people, but for me it did not. I have monthly breakouts of the painful "" under the skin"" blemishes...this products not made to treat this type of acne I'm not mistaken, it might even state that. It's a cool concept and love the design and portability so I gave it 3 stars. I just should have read about it more carefully."
1,Awful customer service from Zeno,"I purchased a Zeno for my daughter a year ago and it worked as advertised. This year I purchased another Zeno for my other daughter. The unit I received was defective - the adapter did not fit the unit, therefor the Zeno would not charge. Without a charged battery, it doesn't work at all. I called Zeno 4 times. All 4 times, my call went directly to voice mail with a promise to call me back. I never got one call back. I sent 3 emails. One email got a response - the response was ""we'll respond to you shortly."" I never did get a response. All of this occurred over a period of about 3 weeks. Finally, I contacted Amazon. Even though I was now a few days beyond Amazon's 30 day return period, they did the right thing and sent me a new Zeno. Thank you Amazon! If you buy this product, find it at a local store so you can return it if necessary. I have a hard time recommending any product sold by a sleazy company."
3,For Hunter Fans Only,"If you're expecting the blazing intensity of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" it is definitely not here. Perry is not Thompson. His writing is just barely adequate. I would recommend this book only to those who, like myself, are fascinated by Hunter S. Thompson and want to know more about the man. This book is overly long and drags at points. Some of the funniest and most exciting stories are marred by a writing style that borders on the drab. But we do get insights into the real Hunter S. Thompson, even if these insights do mar the illusion of perfect madness that is presented in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."""
2,Wrinkle-free vs Movement Dystonia-free,"How empowering !A full length feature on Botox and it's use to 'reverse wrinkles'.Anyone interested in knowing that Botox has been used to successfully treat debilitating neurologic movement disorders such as DYSTONIA, spasticity etc. ?Are we such a vain society that we are willing to acknowledge a wrinkle-free society yet remain unaware of the benefits this toxin has in allowing others to regain voluntary muscle control and movement ?Temporarily fixed...with Botox..enough to write without abnormal movements..but not wrinkle-free..."
2,Plain Looking,Average at best. Teapot lid arrived broken. I contacted Klinq and they were not able to send me a replacement for over 2 months. I am returning it.
3,what happened here,let me tell u that no limit lost a good rapper but to mr serve u messed up leaving since u left and u made that cd it is not all that bouncy like new orleans rap should be. what are u trying to do be hard core cause u not hard core u r a bouncy type of rapper mr. ex no limit. try again oh and next time use more known rappers that are good and can help u out
4,This doll was ok a little less expensive,Alex injoyed this Luigi Plush doll too however it was a little different contruction than all his others. This one was a little more felty
3,Luigi Mid-size plush doll,"Cute doll, but still not the correct size needed. My son liked it, but I wasn't all that impressed with the quality, the eyes are iron-on, as well as the ""L"" on the hat and the yellow buttons, which will all eventually rub off if handled too much."
1,A complete rip off!!,As others have mentioned this flimsy piece of plastic only makes the clog worse. I had a slow drain but after using this I now have a clogged drain.
5,"Hard to find, but worth keeping on hand.","I have used this product several times over the last few years. It is difficult to find, thus the reason I am searching on line. I suggest you wear gloves because hair balls, soap and body debris create a slimy mess. So, I grab the rubber gloves and a small bag. I take the hair that I get out of my drain and throw it a small bag and then run the Zip It down the drain a few more times looking for additional clumps. It works like a dream. No chemicals and it takes just a few minute. The worse part is looking at the clumps. : )"
2,Did nothing.,"Got it, tried it, didn't work. At all! I was hopeful, since i dont wanna damage the pipes, but there was a little inclination in the back of my mind that this is too simple, and it was. I dont think I have the common drain system where the wire would go straight down, mine takes a sharp angle turn to the right, so when I stuck it in and pulled it back slowly, nothing followed. Might work for your drain, but did nothing for mine so i give it 2 stars."
3,Cleaned drain alright,"I placed it down the drain several times and some gunk came up. Unfortunately, it was a black sludge not the hair I'd hoped. It cleaned the drain for now but it looks like we might have a bigger problem.I'd recommend this product, just hope it's only hair."
1,Useless,"Absolutely useless.The drain in my bathtub is clogged and remains so after using this product. I did nothing for me.It is too short, does not reach the clog down the tube.$5 + delivery fee (almost $20) down the drain."
3,Couldn't get it far down my pipes,"This is a nifty little device. Unfortunately, it wouldn't go more than 4-6 inches into my tub or bathroom sink drains before being blocked by something solid. Not sure if it's a sharp turn in the pipe or something else. So it didn't turn out to be very useful to me."
4,I recommend it,"be cautious and use it carefully because I twisted it several times after extending it into the drain and then pulled very hard...I broke off a nylon attachment to the small round drain stopper. I like this gadget, though, because family members leave a lot of long hair in drains."
5,Inexpensive and highly effective,"I've had one of these around for some time and never opened it. Yesterday I finally decided to do something about a very slow bathroom drain. I was going to use a plunger (again) but remembered the ZipIt.It worked fantastically!! Be warned: you pull up some pretty gross stuff. Soap slimy hair, mostly. I did it three times, Ran the water and it was like the drain was sucking it down, compared to how it had been (not) working.I guess other reviews said it doesn't work on every situation. Well, maybe not; but then, what does?I just recommended this to my far-away son, and I do so to you also."
1,don't bother,this product doesn't work. and i was foolish enough to order 4 of these. money down the drain...but not the drain this item was supposed to clean out. I think I'll just save my money and call a Plumber.
1,Bad for newer faucets,"I'd give this a 0 if I could. It might have worked in my old sink but it is not designed for a new one. I followed directions to insert this tool into my bathroom sink. Once in, the only way to get it out was to remove the stopper with the zip-it still in it. Given how the pop up stopper is designed, the zip-it is going to remain attached to it. I'm going to have to replace the stopper. Total waste of money. The turbo snake type of drain cleaner does work in newer sinks and I'm going to buy one of those when my sink gets reassembled"
