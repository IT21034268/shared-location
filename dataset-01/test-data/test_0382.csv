2,Don't take the hassle,"I bought this because I need a cheap inexpensive video card for my workgroup computers on my LAN that can play a few games. When I got it, I put it in a computer and it didn't work. I had to get drivers for it and it finally did, but the monitor was really bad in flickering. I thought it was just liek that so I played a few games. It was decent, 50fps on counter-strike. But then when I installed the monitor driver, it totally messed up. I'm running WIndows XP and it totally screwd the computer. I had to restor ethe darn thing. Then I tried on other comps and it does the same darn thing. Bad flickering and it crashes every 3-4 boots."
2,Below Average,Webbie is a below average rapper and his debut is not very good but had one hit which was a song about sex of course. Not too many songs got my attention but if you are a fan of him then buy but if you are not then download the one hit. I am probably going get a lot of hate by giving this 2 stars but this album is not worth you money.
1,Disappointed,"When I saw this wheelchair on-line I was really excited. I have a developmentally delayed 6 yr. old granddaughter who has many friends in wheelchairs and she wanted one for her baby dolls. When I ordered it, I was thinking it would be like a doll stroller that she could push her dolls in. When I received it, I realized it could only sit on a table, it was way to small to walk and push. It was built well, but did not look like a real wheelchair. I was so disappointed that I returned it for a refund."
1,No sync,This watch worked fine for awhile but then I was using some of the features and got it out of synch with the appropriate date and couldn't get it back in sync. I guess I should have been patient and waited for a few days to see if it would work again but I got exasperated and threw it in the trash. I didn't really like the watch anyway as I thought it was unattractive.
2,BOOOOORING!!,"I have read almost every book written by Lori Wick and I think her latest ones are just not that great. This book leads you to believe it is a romance set in the South Pacific and will take place during the war. The plot actually had tremendous potential. Well, the bulk of the book is set in California with one of the ""lead"" characters (the Navy man) absent from every chapter for about half the story. I could care less about girls shopping and altering clothing or the arrival of a pet kitten. There are three main things wrong with this book: 1. Boring. 2. Boring. 3. Boring. I realize all three points are the same but it is such an important one I feel I must repeat it. I look for books that I can't put down. I had a very difficult time even wanting to pick this one up. I think Ms. Wick should take a break from writing until she can weave a yarn as great as her earlier works. You'd be better off reading some of those."
3,Well.....,"You know mu cousin recomended this book to me and i like it but i felt like the climax was at the beginning of the book when she got rescued by Riggs and his crew and it was kind of weird how they had to toss in the whole "" i havent had my period in 6 weeks but im gonna have it right here on the ship"" i found that unnessesary but thats just my opinion. Also the whole book was bunched together like she had an idea but just lost it because everything happened way to fast. I personally would have REALLY liked the book had it had more to the text."
1,READER BEWARE!!!,"This was honestly the worst Lori Wick book I've ever read! It was terribly boring. The synopsis is rather deceiving, you get the impression that it would talk more of her experience on the island, but that only takes a few pages and the rest of it is set in the States. It is very slow and the romance is rushed at the end.The ONLY reason I finished it was because I kept on thinking it would get better...not. I usually like her books. If you feel like you need to read this, borrow it and save your hard earned money. I would suggest her Kensington Chronicles instead, MUCH better!"
5,Excellent Experience,The people at Pacificmacs did an excellent job of resolving an issue with the computer after I received it. They stand behind what they sell.I recommend them without reservations.
4,Pretty good series,"There is just something great about all these black and white television shows! Color just takes something away from it...Though I'll admit the theme song is quite uh...stifeling...it's one of those that sticks in your head. I catch myself singing it and my son looks at me like I just lost my mind. The episodes keep you interested and the quality of the videos are okay. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, but it's good considering the time and budget back then. I wish there were more than 20 episodes available though..."
4,A case against religiousity,This book is not about moderate theists it is about people who are very much into their religion be it secular or theistic and what it does to the thinking of a person who is very rigid in their beliefs.
4,Good value,"Good drive for the price.Hardware installed on the first try. Software was a problem.The supplied Nero CD wouldn't install on my Compaq Presario. A couple of e-mails later, CenDyne mailed me an NTI CD Maker 2000 CD. That installed OK, but the version supplied didn't support the 00091.A couple of more e-mails and another CD was mailed to me. Installed it and it works great. No problems doing audio or data CDs.Most customer service e-mails were answered in 48 hours. Certainly had worse service!"
2,"Derivitive, Preposterous, Made For The Movies","Compliments to this male author for attempting to portray the woman's point of view--until it dawns on you that this is a clumsy and cynical device to sell the book to Hollywood. There is nothing authentic or believable about the protagonist. She is a writer--wow! Where did Abrahams get the idea for THAT? The main male character is literally someone the author dreamed up. He has the insubstantiality and mutability of someone out of a dream. People know something about prisons and might want to know a lot more but this book will not educate them. The one thing the author does know something about is bars. Had he spent less time drinking and hanging out, and done more living, this would have been a better book. The plot is implausible, to put it gently, with an ending you can see coming a mile off."
1,Ridiculous,"I did not believe one word of this story. The main character, a woman, is completely unbelievable. I felt no suspense at any point. Near the end, when she keeps asking ""Where is [a major unseen character]?"" and [the person she's asking] does nothing but change the subject, she has no clue whereas the reader feels hit over the head with the obvious. If you want real suspense, read Thomas Perry."
2,not convincing as it proceeds,"This novel starts out okay, with a likable, pretty heroin in an unusual situation, and good writing too--but the second half of the book is a far reach, way beyond what can be convincing. The key bit that has her haul around a long, heavy extension ladder and then climb it to the third-story window of a hospital with a two-foot bolt cutter tucked in her belt would be a feat worthy of Wonder Woman. Then to expect the bad guy to come to a desolate meeting point alone and unarmed is the height of naivety. And those are just examples of why I became so disappointed in what promised to be a good read."
5,Live at the Paradiso Amsterdam DVD,"If you are a Live fan, this DVD definitely will bring you back to seeing them play ""live!"" It is truly as close as it gets to re-living the experience that only a true Live fan can grasp. No one can deny they put on an excellent show and give their all every night! ""We all wanna dance with you!"""
1,Lousy,"These blocks just don't stay together. My son was aggravated making it. I had to hot glue some pieces together, they just would not snap together."
3,Yoga of Herbs,"I found this book far more useful in the initial stages of my interest in Ayurveda, but since that time find much of the material in the book questionable and unsubstantiated. How for example, do the authors obtain the energetics for western herbs? The reader should be reminded that the designation of energetic possibilities of medicinal plants on the subcontinent occured over hundreds, if not thousands of years. Thus, much of the energetic designations in this book seem to be based on no more than the inclinations of the authors. My experience is that while the energetics seem well rationalized, they don't always pan out. Thus, a good introductory book, but take it with a grain of 'saindhava'..."
5,Bible health & herbs,For someone who want take own health in own hands.My health is my passion. I recommend this very professional book.
3,not like Reaves' earlier works,"Sounds suspiciously like Tangerine Dream of the 80's/90's. I like Reaves' earlier stuff much better...smoother, calmer. Yes, everyone breaks out eventually and that's OK. I'm just saying that if you expect this to be like Wunjo, it isn't."
1,Unsuccessful Install,"I have an AMD K6-2 CPU and an Amptron PM9600 motherboard with TXTwo chipset (no onboard video). According to all advertised material, my system met all requirements. Unfortunately, installation proved impossible. I could only get 16 colors at 640x480 resolution. I downloaded new NVIDEO drivers, downloaded new drivers from PNY, downloaded new chipset and motherboard drivers, tried multiple BIOS settings, contacted PNY tech support (impossible by phone, but fast email response), searched the GeForce FAQ website (search for geforcefaq) for solutions, all to no avail. After many hours and multiple reboots and tweeking and experimenting, my old video board is back in and the GeForce2 board is out. The moral: if you have a vanilla Intel chipset, board, and CPU, this will probably work just fine. If you don't, save yourself the trouble and look for a less demanding video board."
2,Beware,I have a very odd computer it has onboard graphics that will not auto disable or turned off i can install the card but cannot use it there is no tech support so check and double check that you can use it it is a great bargin for a pci card
5,Refreshing new viewpoint,I really like this book because it is much less regimented than most other dog books. The author takes a very common sense approach to training dogs.
2,good for a first time trainer,This book does not contain anything different than you would find in any good dog training book. The emphasis is on establishing a good basic training foundation and to be sure your pup knows the basic commands well. A good book for the first time trainer.
2,Not very accurate,"I have used this for years, and it is not as accurate as I would want a thermometer to be; it's sometimes off by a degree or more. When it said ""Lo"" I changed the battery, and still have same error message- I will switch brands now that I need a new thermometer."
5,Using for a TV stand,"I purchased this to use in my old entertainment center to lift up a 26"" flat panel TV because I was unable to rearrange the center's one shelf to raise the TV set. I chose this stand because it said it would accommodate a wide monitor, the specifications said it would accommodate the weight of the TV, and the legs came in sections so that I could adjust the height. I also have some space under the stand where I can store the remotes and some DVD's. This worked well for me."
4,Works great,"This is perfect for setting my laptop up off the desktop surface. I destroyed one laptop by having my cat bump my coffee cup and dumping it in the center of the laptop. Now I have my new computer up on this stand and there is no chance the coffee could be spilt on it again. I like its simplicity, it is solid and it raises my laptop screen so that it is level with the other monitor I use with it. I suppose if you put something in the center of it that weighed 50 lbs or more it may sag a little, but I find it to be quite sturdy. I bought 3 more for my husband and for our home in mexico. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the legs should be black also."
3,For the office,This is near perfect for the space i was trying to make comfy for the office. The price is ideal.
3,No pockets?,"I would not have bought these had I remembered to check to see if they had pockets. No pockets. Every piece of athletic wear should have at least one pocket. Otherwise, the pants are OK."
3,very thin material,"I should have read the reviews more carefully about the weight of these pants. These are a very lightweight material, meant to be worn indoors, whether at the gym or at home. I was looking for sweatpants to wear outdoors when it gets cold, but looks like I'll be using these for pajama pants."
1,Great for Hot Air Ballooning,"These were huge!!!!!!!!!!! I got my wife a medium (should have gotten small, all women are small). It should have fit according to the size chart. But no! These fit me perfect!! I am 6'2"" 200 lbs witha 33 inch waist. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them or wear them myself."
3,I Goldwyn Follies,"I only ordered this to hear Kenny Baker sing ""loved walked in"" , The film itself is very dated. There are 3 comedians that keep appearing in the film which are really very unfunny and very corny.The film is very out dated and should have gone to the cutting room floor. Kenny Baker singing is the only bits worth watching. Over all, a very corny out dated film. The rest of the cast are unknown and also very hamy"
4,The Gershwins Last Musical,"This is a classic 1930's montage musical with the same basic plot inherent in all that decade's films but with the tremendous advantage that it marked the last contribution of George and Ira Gershwin's to America's musical history,as George died during the making of the movie.With ""Our Love is Here to Stay' and ""Love Walked In"",pundits have been able to say ""What a way to go!"" as the leading heartthrob tenor of the day,Kenny Baker,did a beautiful job on beautiful songs.The movie includes the variety revue of acts deemed necessary for a sucessful musical of the decade--grand opera,ballet(with the gorgeous Zorina),silly antics of the talented but hammy Ritz Brothers,and terrible comedy of Edgar Bergen and his wooden sidekick,Charlie McCarthy,with a throw-away performance by then popular comedian,Phil Baker.It's truly a trip down memory lane with the added bonus of two of the most wonderful songs ever written!"
1,if you have a large screen tv or projection system...,"If you have a large screen tv or projection system, the video is sadly lacking in clarity."
4,Great toaster for the price u pay,Even if it lacks the control/release button for your toasting purpose it works great. You got to be careful when using burrito type of breads though because the heat causes the bread to swell and bubbles form in it which may stick to the top element and causes fire. Other than this minor problem overall it is a very good toaster and I am happy with it.
1,Sad Toaster Oven,"I recently replaced an older B&D toaster oven, which I loved, with this newer model. The best feature is the removable crumb tray, which makes cleaning a pleasure. Otherwise, this appliance burns foods at the recommended time and temperatures, and cooks unevenly. It is a BIG disappointment!"
3,Good examples with complicated programs,"Hi friends,I have just read some of its sample pages. Programs are really good with easy to understand approach. However, i think this is for beginners."
5,Love it!,"This pot rack is both beautiful and well made. For those with limited space, it doesn't take up much room but holds alot. One of the few remaining American built, quality products."
4,Fogcutter tea,My Doctor actually had me try some of this tea to help relieve some of the side effects caused by some of my current medications. I had my doubts but the tea worked and it even tastes good. I'm more awake and alert during the day and even sleep better at night because I'm more active during the day. There may also be another benefit as it seems I have even lost a few pounds as well.
2,It could be better,"I was expecting more form this item. The case works in protecting your cell phone from scratches, but it's not very practical the belt clip, specially if you're not slim. The display of the phone can not be seen very clearly because the case has a platic that covers the screen and it gets dirty very easily, very difficult to clean it. Not to say it with sweat in some summer days... The inner of the case is texturized like velvet, but in a few month it worns out and your phone gets dirty... Save a headache, try some other case. (I just bought the scuba version from Body Glove, try that one instead)"
1,"If you got many devices, skip this product","If you read the manual, it will tell you that the main product limitation comes from having to share one USB 1.1 port with many different devices-- your mouse and keyboard interactions will be guaranteed to hiccup every 3 seconds. I thought it was a great idea until I tried it out myself."
1,Don't buy it,If I could go lower than one star I would. This thing keeps locking up the computer. The audio keeps shutting down. The USB ports keep going down. It has been nothing but a headache. Better off getting a good USB hub.
5,Fascinating,"I picked up this book used in an antique store for $5.00. From the first chapter, my husband had to give me a blow-by-blow ""WOW--get THIS!"" every night while reading it.Apparently filled with unbelievable military chance errors and sheer coincidences that turned the tide of major battles, this book would be a facscinating read for anyone interestedin Civil War trivia, or just curious to see how many times the United States came within a hair's breadth of being permanently divided. Great read--I'm waiting my turn!"
4,33 spanish 80's hits!,This is a pack of 3 Cds with 11 songs each. So you get 33 songs for a really low price. I was really happy until I opened it and realized they are not the original singers. They sound similar but they are all covers. It still is a good collection of songs.
1,Corrupt card; lost all photos,Bought for Florida vacation; lost about 200 pictures. I did not buy it from Amazon though.
3,Swanson Expired Products,I ordered mine off amazon / Swanson Health Products - and it was very old and expired I've used this product before its incredible but just don't order it from Swanson - they didn't offer to give me newer product.
5,Better than She's Come Undone,"If you liked ""She's Come Undone"" you will love this book. I listened to this book on tape and would love to find it in print so I can share it with my book club. The story is gripping, the characters full, and the writing is masterful. The story involves/revolves around the game of chess. I cannot think of a more boring thing to read about. Instead of being bored, you are riveted as this tale of overcoming the odds, the system and most of all self defeating behavior is uplifting as well as insightful. A tale well worth reading."
4,In your face,"Not much can be expected of Soviet sound from the sixties, but the performance is fairly aggressive for those who like their Beethoven so. Yudina certainly doesn't dwell on the humor in the work, but her outsized personality is apparent at all times."
5,A Great Guide for the Mushroom Lover,"I have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing, but I would have to say this is one of the best. This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because it makes the book much more manageable.The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener."
5,"A great book, that makes you think about life!!",This book was great. I kept wanting to read more. It made me want to do better and better each day. It was definatley thought provoking. I can't wait until the next book is published.
5,Great book for cue collectors,Great reference material for anyone interested in collecting cues. Just wish the book was hardback.
1,my cat hates it!,"i guess this is a personal preference but my cat abhors this paste. she can smell it on my finger or on the toothbrush and she gives me this 'wild' look. :(it is hard enough to brush a cat's teeth but this makes it even harder. From the cat owners reviews for the seafood product, it seems that most cats dont care for this too much while one owner's cat enjoyed it. oh well. will try another paste flavor or brand once this seafood flavor (which dont even smell like seafood) is no more. i cannot say how well this works b/c havent been religiously brushing my little cat's teeth."
4,Hooded,"This 1991 soundtrack release contains 14 tracks with that hood appeal. Taken from funk, 70's tunes ""How To Survive In South Central"", is an instruction tale by Ice Cube on how you should conduct yourself in the City Of Angels. The Yo-Yo track, ""Mama Don't Take No Mess"" has personalized lyrics that we could relate to while personally growing up. ""Growin' Up In The Hood"" is an offbeat, gangster groove by Compton's Most Wanted. The only East Coast group to represent on this soundtrack is Main Source, with thier police tale of ""Just A Friendly Game Of Basebaseball (Remix)"". Watts' own Kam has a tale of streetlife on ""Every Single Weekend"", but Too Short tells us ""It's Your Life"". You can't have a soundtrack without a slow jam. The group Tony! Toni! Tone! drops the smooth ""Me And You"". Keep in mind this soundtrack meshed with the actual movie and it does have some hidden gems on here. Thanks for John Singleton for giving us Boyz N The Hood."
4,What's the name of that song?,Does anybody know the name of the very first song that plays at the end of the movie?
3,Least favorite of the series,"It was as if Cabot was on a deadline and was unsure of where to take Mia next.Overall, I liked the book. I just adore Mia and all of her irrationalities, but in this book I found her a bit too much.It is a must-read for those who love the series, but I wouldn't recommend the book on any other basis."
2,Not holding up well,"Purchased this as a toddler bed set in Nov 2011 for my son. After the 2nd wash, I noticed a 3 inch tear where the trim attaches to the body of the comforter. I should have exchanged it then because it was only about 2 months later but it was low on the priority list so it never got returned for an exchange. Since then it has been washed an average of 1 to 2 times a month and the colors are fading. I have blankets and comforters much older than this one that look like we just bought them yesterday! My son loves his 'truck blanket' though so I guess we'll have it until it falls apart, no matter how shabby it gets."
4,Takes hip-hop to a whole 'nother level,"Dr. Octagon has a style all his own, pushing the limits of the rhythm while still always maintaining a tight flow. With all the lackluster MC's out there, rapping over mediocre beats & samples, this album gives hope for the future of hip-hop. Everything, from the heavy and innovative beats from the Automator, to the phat scratches that you'd expect from Q Bert, is so on point it's scary. The only complaint I have it Octagon's insistence on putting a lame and repetitive hook into every song; if he just stuck on flowing instead of trying to make the songs commercial, the album would be perfect. Other than that, this album is the new benchmark in pushing the limits of hip-hop, and has yet to be surpassed since its release."
4,Go out and get it today!,"This is a cool movie for kids, families, and people who acknowledge the little child inside. The story is intriguing although the acting leaves a bit to be desired. I rented this movie and I was so enraptured by it that I didn't even want to pause the movie to use the restroom. The action, humor, and emotional quality of this movie makes it worth the price to totally rent and even own. overall, this is a sweet movie that tells an lovely albeit hard to believe story."
5,Loved it,"The Last Mimzy is about a little girl and her older brother who find some toys on the beach while on Easter vacation and find out their things from the future. Emma Wilder finds a stuffed rabbit named Mimzy who talks to her and tells her things. They also find spinners which can see the future. Their parents wonder what's really going on with their kids. Emma quickly wants to get Mimzy back to the future or she'll die. It's Emma's tears that save the future and the future scientests and kids find humanity which saves their world. I love this movie, it's not that scary and it's cool and interesting. The two actors who play the Emma and Noah are amazing and I loved the little girl who played Emma. She's adorable. This is a good family film and I liked the ending, too."
2,does not make much sense,"When a movie blows its own trumpet on its cover by saying ""best movie since ET"" etc etc, it usually means trouble. This is definately nowhere near as good as ET, infact no comparison to that landmark film. The movie does not make much sense, even for an adult. How did the future people send the packages back through time ? What was the purpose of the twinkling twirling stones and other gismos, other than to look good on the screen ? Very amateur stuff. Wouldn't mind so much if the producers didn't always try to up the ratings by jumping on another movie's bandwagon by comparing it to the classic."
4,Good movie,"Talented child actors. Great clean movie for all ages. A bit on the sci fi side, still loved it. Recommended."
2,I wish it had stayed truer to the short story.,"This movie is loosely based on the Science Fiction Hall of Fame short story ""Mimzy were the Borogroves"" in which the ""scientist"" in the future is really a bumbling fool who sets the story in motion by mistake and had nothing to do with an intentional attempt to recruit kids from the past (today) to save the future from humanity ruining the planet. However, the movie does capture the learning from futuristic toys stuff pretty well. Anyway, I recommend you read the story."
5,This is a must see film for all ages,"I would have given this film 10 stars if they would have let me. This is one of those films that somehow got overlooked in the theaters. It was a beleivable sci-fi story, and the acting was very well done. This will be a classic film for the ages."
1,not very interesting,"i had this book to read for a class at james madison university and if your living and breathing...don't read this book. it was dry and didn't grab my attention at all.if you want facts, then this is the book for you.if you want good reading,pick another book."
3,For the Depeche Mode Diehard Fan ONLY!,"I purchased this book/cd because it had the name DEPECHE MODE on it. Honestly, I really didn't know what I was buying. The print in the book is fairly small, because it is in English and Italian. (It's like reading cliff notes. English is on one side of the page, Italian is on the other.) The material, however, is an enjoyable read. For the diehard collector (like myself), it is a unique item that I would recommend purchasing. Do not buy it just to hear the remixes of the song, because they are repetitive, as most remixes tend to be. I am happy with the purchase, as will you be, but only if you are a DM fanatic!"
3,Same Here,"Same as the previous reviewer...the concept is terrific but the installation is a nightmare! To add insult to injury, the installation instructions are clearly written in english by a native speaker, but are more of a hindrance than help! Some of the stuff they tell you to do to install this thing is just plain wrong. After much swearing and frustration, the rod is up and seems a little unstable...hopefully it will hold together."
5,A great book for ATL,"If you are a COM C++ developer, this book is great and it answer a lot of your questions. However, it is not for COM beginners. If you are a beginner, definitly buy Essential COM (by Don Box).After reading Essential COM, you should own this book. It is excellent to learn ATL and as a reference too."
1,good book if you know ATL,"If you know COM, DCOM, and ATL, this is a great book. If you don't, then get Active Template Library from Tom Armstrong, and after you've read it then come back and read this book"
1,dish mop,flimsy short mop and does not show that it is divided into two sections on the mop. Would not buy again.
3,Great Circuit A; Circuit B Only So-so,"Circuit A is excellent. Great workout to grow into if you're a beginner, but will still challenge the more fit. Someone is doing the low-impact version the whole time, or you can follow the instructor for maximum impact. Circuit B was kind of annoying to me; the instructor is goofing off and keeps losing count of the reps."
4,Useful training DVD,Jeanette Jenkins: Hollywood Trainer 21 Day Total Body Circuit was recommended by Fitness Magazine. I was pleased with the price. I found the DVD to be a very useful addition to my library of tapes. It could be part of a daily regimen which would include either the A or the B workout after a half hour of some cardio work (I have a Nordic Track cross country ski machine)
2,the price was fair,"A interesting purchase for the sake of old time comedy television and some star power , but not nearly as much Johnny Carson as the cover would imply. This is very early Carson, in black and white."
2,Not as expected,"The DVD arrived on time and in good shape However let the buyer beware. Seeing this as it was shown I believed it was All Johnny Carson. I expected 35 episodes of Carson including the Tonight Show. The DVD has Some of the first shows done by Johnny Carson, none of the Tonight Show the rest of the 35 episodes were of other old stars. Maybe my fault for not reading the entire description. Very Disappointing."
1,Disappointing,I found this to be a bit dull and boring. The write up of the book made it sound a lot better than it truly is.
1,Doesn't measure up to the other Chris Moore's novels,"""Lust Lizard"" lacks the elements that made Moore's other four novels so good: complex characters (human AND non-human), interesting story with lots of twists, unpredictable ending, great humor, soft-cover price.I am extremely disappointed, but still look forward Moore's next one. If we're lucky it will be up there with Blood-Sucking Fiends or Coyote Blue."
5,I love zees mon!,"He makes me laugh. Every book from this man is a gem. In fact, just start with his first novel, Practical Demonkeeping, and read/laugh your way through his creations. :)"
4,Puff whatever Chris is smoking,"My only regret is that I've reached seventy without getting a puff of whatever Christopher Moore is smoking. Get the book, sit back, and light up. There's a dragon who will keep your fire going. ...and passages you can only marvel at. After this fifth book, Moore is on his way to God knows where, but I'll gladly go along."
2,Cindy,This item is a cheap cassette player. I will be buying a better one in time. Bulky.. but it does play ok. The headsets are also on the cheap side... I got what I paid for.
1,broken,item arrived in a timely fashion but was broken. It was sent back per Amazon instructions. It was part of a multiorder shippment. The other electronic was also broke. Amazon has reimbursed for one of the items but not this one. They have not responded to my request about reimbursing me for this one. I will not buy electronics from Amazon again.
4,Good Value for the Price,Good value for the price. I know it won't last forever but it's perfectly adequate for right now.
1,junk!!!!!!,"JWIN JX-B32A AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player with Bass Boost (JWIN JXB32A)I bought this for my husband who is a truck driver so he could listen to Audio Book cassettes. He put the batteries in, turned it on and it popped and smoke came out. Needless to say, it doesnt work!! I cant return it cuz he is already on the road so unless your kind enuff to refund me, I guess I threw away that money!!!!"
2,amazon purchase,Not as good as my colby cassette player that I bought in the past The sound is weak and I have to play it on the loudest button
2,"Somewhat Useful, But also Out-dated and Junk Science","The author lists many useful (but obvious) items in protecting Earth (insularting your home, recycling, etc). Starts off talking about how Earth is in ""peril"" and might not be around in 10 years. Well, its been over 10 years and the doomsday scenarios haven't happened. That's what happens when you rely on emotional crusaders instead of reason and science. And we have also found that humans have little - if anything - to to with ozone depletion (don't hear much about anymore) or global warming. Since this book was written we pretty much banned CFC use and evil corporate giant McDonalds doesn't make the anti-Earth packaging this book talks about. So read with caution, read with a critical mind."
3,Not a flying toy!,"Pro:Looks great out of the box.Cons:The kite is inherently unstable with its axially attached strings.That could be fixable with additional strings if not for its quality problems.After the first flight the stitching is coming apart and the rods are protruding through holes in stitches and fabrics.Basically it's ""for display only"".Nevertheless my 3-year-old twin boys enjoy this kite for what it is: a big blue jet plane and they do not care about its inabilities.That's why three stars instead of one and why I am keeping this kite instead of returning it back for a refund."
5,Eating Well cookbook,The receipes are scrumptious. This is a long time favorite of mine and I love to buy it for others.
3,Someone stole my original one,"Delighted to have a replacement for my original copy of this book, although I miss all of my handwritten notes. Eating Well does a great job of writing recipes for real food, not diet misery. Their newer publications may be better choices in the 2012 market, but this classic still deserves a place in my library."
2,Ok - not that accurate not that durable,Title says it all - you can do better. Not very accurate and eventually broke
1,Doesn't work after a couple of weeks,"At first it worked, then it worked intermittently (not a good thing!), and now it just doesn't work at all. No matter where I turn the dial (always past 30 minutes or it won't work), it doesn't budge. Look elsewhere."
1,not very durable,I bought this to replace a similar one I lost during a move. But this one is VERY lightweight and not very durable. I dropped it once and it never worked again.
3,I didn't remember many songs,"I listened to a lot of rap back in the time when this was out, but I don't remember many songs off of it."
5,Fun family film,My daughter taped this off nick last year and she watches it over and over--and it's very funny. My son also loves the nanny in it.
3,"My Brother The Douche...My Brother The Pig...My Brother. Wait, Something's Missing Here.","Note: I saw this movie on TV.I was intrigued by the premise of this movie and Ms. Johannsson. Ultimately, the film is a minor disappointment. SPOILER ALERT!!! I wished that Kathy was more loving to her brother at the end, though he was an anoying jerk throughout the film. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! (I wish the camera had shown Eva Mendes naked). Those are my only quibbles with the film. Rent it."
2,flimsy shoe rack,"This product looked like an exsisting shoe rack that I had in my closet. However, on delivery it is much flimsier with poorer quality wood. I actually broke one of the slats off the rack while trying to assemble and I wasn't using much force.I would recommend something sturdier."
2,so-so recorder,it records but not by voice activation and there are no instructions for trouble shooting. Okay if all you want is a small recorder.
4,"Surprisingly good, with well-portrayed undead.","I am not much of a DragonLance fan. I tend toward mainstream fantasy, such as Donaldson and Brooks, and a little bit of Salvatore. Still, I picked it up because of the cover and was happy that I did. I don't know much of the history of DragonLance, but I enjoyed reading about Schallsea Island, and I particularly liked the characters of the gnoll and the elf, Gair. It was a moody book, with a good dash of combat thrown in. I recommend this one!"
1,A disgrace to the Dragonlance Series,"This is the only Dragonlance novel I've read so far(I've read 73) that I haven't liked. This book had a terrible plot and the characters were weak. Gair's change to the darkside was unrealisticly fast and did not show his struggle with it very well at all. I won't even go into all the mistakes Jean Rabe made about Dragonlance history. This book made Goldmoon, a character brilliantly protrayed by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, look bad. It's a shame that this book was allowed to be published and I hope that the 5th age books aren't as bad."
2,good idea blown away,"This was a clever idea for a movie: the trail of lives touched by a wedding dress. Unfortunately, in the screenwriter's apparent desire to put as many unexpected, even quirky, turns in the story as possible, he forgot that a story is supposed to be appealing. A few moments were. Most were either routine daytime soap-opera material or just boring.Also, the casting was incredible. It's as though someone tried to win the prize for who could cast the largest number of unappealing actors and actresses in a single movie. There were one or two exceptions, like Margaret Colin, but the other eight or ten--or however many there were--ranged from off-putting to repulsive.Apparently, a number of people liked this movie, so maybe you will too. I don't really understand why. I like a good human-interest story. Unfortunately, this was not one."
1,Why would they mess up a potentially family movie with swearing?,"I'm a romantic and looked forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately, we had to stop it about a quarter of the way through because there was swearing in it. Our rule is - if there is cursing - off it goes. It's sad because it sounded like it had an interested plot. Too bad we had to throw it away."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with book and I would love to tell the Author why. I am having problems with my mother-in-law but it is different then what is in the book. What about the mother-in-law that won't give up her oldest son. My mother-in-law doesn't respect me as his wife or the mother of her grandchildren. I have always gone out of my way to do nice things for her because I think that family is so important and she raised my wonderful husband. I want my children to know their grandmother but I won't let her run over me. If I tell her that I don't want something done regarding my kids she will do whatever she wants. She will come in my house and move things around and correct me in front of my kids. Not all daughter-in-laws are bad, it can be the mother-in-law having problems excepting that their is a new women in her sons life. I wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."
2,content vs. sound quality,"the recording has a representative collection of Heifitz's concert standards, as well as some more obscure works. even after digital remastering, the poor sound quality detracts from the enjoyment of the pieces. apparently the original performances were for broadcast in the 1940's and early 50's. it sounds like someone had a recorder in front of the radio.should be of interest to collectors and music students, not audiophiles. the more popular pieces are available on other recordings; the others seem pretty rare."
4,Works Very Well,Bought this for my fiance's Fusion and it fit perfectly and has held up for years. Definitely worth the money and my girl was thrilled with it.
2,It's a TV Pilot - what do you expect?,"I agree with the reviewer who said ""We've found something special!"" But we haven't. Very early on you can tell that it's made for TV and not only that but ripe for a series. Sure the good guy's HQ gets destroyed but as they said earlier, they operate in cells so no one knows. Tim Matheson is not known to have died. The death of Sabbath's boy is left open.The writing is only TV grade as is the acting. But if you look at this like it's a TV pilot then you won't be disappointed. BUT don't spend big money on it. I bought mine in the delete bin at a video store for $1.99 - that's about all it is worth.Wait for it to be on TV as I'm sure it will be shown frequently."
2,Remarkably Bad - Yet Mildly Entertaining,"Hell Swarm is one of those films you pick up thinking you may have stumbled onto a little sleeper of a film that no one but you knows about. After watching it you'll want to keep that secret to yourself - for all the wrong reasons.In truth there are elements of Hell Swarm that, in the right hands - and with a bit more of a budget - could be developed into a decent, gripping little thriller. Unfortunately those hands unfortunately are not Tim Matheson's, who directs (and acts in) the film.Boyd Kestner is appealing as the ""hero"" if a bit bumbling but the rest of the cast seem to have spilled over from WB shows that never aired.Even though there is some swearing, ""decent"" violence and sensuality, the entire affair feels like it was made for, well the WB Network or USA Up All Night."
3,A Questionable Product,"There is some black stuff at the top of every bottle. Assuming it is just concentrated mesquite product, I store the bottles upside down in the box it arrived in. The cook has to remember to pour this seasoning on the bottom of the pan; not on top of the meat. The mesquite flavor only seems to come out when the seasoning is on the side of the meat closest to to heat source of the oven. In other words, if the cook bakes the meat and puts this seasoning on top of the meat, there will be very little mesquite flavor in the meat. I learned this by trial and error."
5,Worth pickin up,"even if you have the original first pressing of the album from Oct. 99, this one is still worth pickin up, espcially if your a plauge member. its on an actual silver cd instead of cdr, has better sound quality, and has some extras that got cut from the original... ... ."
4,Horror or Psychotic Thriller,"I must say that I have viewed many thriller horror, not gore horror and I say this because Rosewood Lane was really different, I understood the plot after looking at ittwice. I like that I didn't know where it was going right off, it wasn't too bad, it was just that you didn't no why the teenager had it in for the young Doctor, of coursemaybe we will find that out if there is an sequel. I enjoyed the movie overall and gave it four stars!"
1,Very superficial treatment,"This was a weak book. I did not enjoy it at all. Actually couldn't bring myself to finish it. Did not give any interesting details of life on a cruise ship for such a long period of time or much substance about the ports of call. Written in a very ""cutsy"" style that I found annoying."
5,Excellent Camera,I have had this camera for over 2 weeks now and am very impressed with the photo quality and the wide range of shooting options available. The camera has a solid feel to it and the sliding lens cover not only protects the lens but doubles as an on/off switch. The feature rich menu and settings are candy to anyone who is interested in exploring the creative elements of digital photography. The automatic setting turns the camera into a no-brainer point and shoot for the neophyte. My wife took the camera to a childrens choir performance with about 30 seconds of instruction and came home with some GREAT pictures. The ability to pop out the CF card and put it in my notebook computer's Type II slot helps save the camera battery when I want to download photos. The sound recording feature and video are handy when you want to capture an action event. Overall I'm very impressed with this camera. Kudos to Canon.
2,"Bummer highlight DVD. But, YES the gay man won!","Bummer! This is only a 2-hour-15 minutes DVD of highlights from the first Survivor. The nudity is nothing really. A rear-end shot of one survivor and Richard sitting down ""tucked under"" and walking naked. But no private parts seen here. Having not seen all of the episodes of Survivor. I was hoping for a complete, unedited, uncensored version, with all episodes Collector's DVD set. I guess it is not possible. One special feature is the ""Survivor: Inside the Phenomenon"", a 20-minute documentary, which I found to be quite interesting, especially how fair the game is, the exhausting hard work Producer, Mark Burnett and the Art Department can do, and how they managed to surprise the Challenge Survivor Winner, Sean, with a surprise visit from his father on the yacht at such short notice. How they got his father there at such short notice is remarkable."
4,Not Bad!,"I'm a huge Survivor fan, and I really enjoyed this DVD. It takes you through all the players and some of the things that they had to do, in the order that they were voted off. It's a highlights disk instead of a replay of the shows. My sister missed the first and second seasons, so this was a great for her to catch up. The best thing about watching Survivor, is that you get to see people stabbing each other in the back to win some silly money. You see, that happens everyday at work, it's just hidden. You don't even know when your being stabbed in the back. The show helps me look for it at work. Thanks Survivor."
1,Boring,"I'm sorry but I did not like this book one bit. Although I loved Mr. Commitment, also written by Mike Gayle, this book was nothing like Mr. Commitment. The book is a very slow read."
2,Gripper review,After trying to use this gripper... I put it in the drawer and went back to computer to look for another brand.... I was so dissappointed in this gripper.... It is very clumsy to use. Its not very well made and with no silicone covering the tong end it slips off the pan.. The handle are bent in a way that makes it difficult to use... I do not recommend this product...I have since found another product similar with silicone covered handles and rubber ends on the tongs that grip the pan to be lifted.... It was much better... Save your money....
3,"Can't handle the 14"" deep dish","I got this to use with the 14"" chicago style deep dish pizza pan, and it couldn't handle picking up that pan when full of pizza. I think it will do okay when we make ten inch pizzas, but I'm a little disappointed."
1,Extremely Religious and if when not - very negative,"Most of the songs on these CDs are very religious, so if you don't want your child to be exposed to that I would recommend looking for a different CD. On top of that when there are songs that are not religious they are just absolutely horrible. As an example of some of the lyrics:1) ""I am squishing up the baby bumblebee (...) I am wiping off the baby bubmlebee (...) ouch it stung me (first of all bumblebees are the most adorable and they don't sting and what are the lyrics????)2) ""you should have seen the monkhe sat on the elephant trunkthe elephant sneezed and fell on his kneesand that was the end of the monk""Seriously for little kids such lyrics? What do you expect your kids to grow up if that's what they listen to?"
5,Love it!!,Awesome CD for kids!! Works like a charm to get kids to sleep!! Great quality and we love it so much!!
3,Eh...,"Im not too crazy about this CD. It was actually my fault for purchasing this because the song track was listed, but there are 100 songs and I really don't know many of them. A lot of the songs are religious in meaning and I don't care for that. My son likes a few songs, that's it."
5,Wonderful for toddlers and preschoolers!,"I love this collection of old-time nursery rhymes and songs put to music by this group of children. This makes a wonderful addition to those who have small children or would even be great for fun time at a preschool.Warning! These songs are catchy and you will remember when you were young and sang some of them, so you may start humming them in the back of your mind. :)A great buy."
4,Had hoped they were the DVDs,"I bought these assuming they were DVDs, I have the DVDs for these same songs with me, but they were failing, I wanted to replace them since they were so good. Putting these songs on is the only way I can keep my kids quiet in the car. However when it got shipped I realized that they were Audio CDs and not DVDs, totally my mistake, but still the Songs are really great for kids and adults to enjoy..."
4,Great deal!,"The quality is good. It has all the songs that every toddler needs to know. There are more religious songs that I would like. But, getting three CDs for the price is hard to beat. I keep one at home, another in my car, and the last one in my spouse's car."
3,Cheap for a cheap price,"Table hold downs tore out on first use - clamped work piece to table to cut square mortise holes; upward force of mortise chisel after cutting hole tore out table hold downs from bottom of table. My solution, drilled holes all the way through table and counter sunk two carriage bolts to replace torn-out hold downs. Not pretty, but works well now. Track in fence is simply routed - no t-track. Will install an aluminum t-track.Bottom line, for the price I can't complain. The table hold downs are worthless. Be prepared to replace these guys with your own design. Worth the money if you're prepared to make a few modifications."
3,OK for the Price,I anxiously awaited this item. After using it I was unimpressed. The clamps do not hold it tightly to the table and the star knobs that hold the fence on stick out past the face of the fence making it imposible to place anything flat against the fence. I solved the problem by building my own fence from a 2x4. Also the T tracks are just routered into the wood.
3,a minor work with nice pictures,"This is a padded-out excuse to present a few anecdotes about Gurdjieff, plus some old photos and such and make a few bucks off the Gurdjieff cultists who must have every book pertaining to him, but so what. It does give another perspective, however insignificant, to the events of three-quarters of a century ago, something that is sorely needed in the environment of true believers of various stripes with the entrenched positions about the man they worship as a living god or dismiss as a charlatan. The truth is somewhere in between, and this work is one of the few that seems to reflect that. And it is quite well presented."
5,Drawing Birds,I got this book for my eight year old grand daughter and she loved it. Even took it to school.
2,Flaky Memory Card,I bought this memory card to use with my MP3 player and have found it to be very unreliable. It has lost tracks that I have put on it and acted in other flaky ways like unexpectedly skipping over tracks. I'm looking into getting a replacement - Verbatim offers a lifetime warranty...
5,As good as it gets,"This is worth the money , i had other options to pick from , but with all the additional HDMI ports , this was the choice i made . you get up to 1080i in regular HD and 1080p using your HDMI cable. Takes a while to get the perfect picture setting you want , but the defaults are great , Toshiba put a lot of thought into this , analog channels don't look that bad either as long as you are sitting 6 feet or more from the TV"
5,Toshiba 32hl67 HDTV,This was the best price and the best for the money. The set was Delivered and set up and checked to see that it worked could not ask for much more. It Has a fantastic picture. was very easy to set up and run.
4,Regza 32,"Great value, paid 719.00, much better than phillips for which I paid 999.00. Easy setup, Amazon delivery sevice great."
3,"Lovely, but finish fading fast","Love everything about this bracelet, but after a few short weeks of occasional wear, I'm already noticing that it is looking less yellow gold and more white gold. Still lovely, and good quality, just not the finish I wanted."
3,overrated,"Before I bought this camera from Amazon, I made sure that I read all the raves, pros and cons and trusted the name canon for a great camera. This camera comes with many features that I probably may not ever need, but its just great having it anyway. For the price, you'd think they will throw in a carrying case or a 64mb compact flash memory card. This camera does not take good pictures at night, it over compensates images thus its blur or becomes too 'fake' or 'dark'. its only great for indoors (the red eye does not work either) and outdoors (during daytime). its a good camera to have if you are into digital photography, but if its quality pix you are looking for, canon rebel is still the best buy out there."
4,Not for those who travel abroad,"I bought this camera because of all the wonderful consumer and critic reviews. However, if you are someone that travels frequently or is out of the country and want to email pics back to family and friends of places you are visiting, then I suggest looking into an Olympus instead. In order to view your pics or email them or just upload them onto a computer, you need to first install the canon software. This is not practical if you are in a random internet cafe in Europe.The Olympus allows you to upload pics using only the USB cable without having to install software. There is a catch on the Olympus too. You can only upload your pictures without having to upload software if you are using Microsoft XP/ME editions. Really do your research before buying."
4,"Great camera, it costs more at half com than anywhere else??",I got mine at gateway for $ 419 dollars with free shipping. (coupon) Places like half com and ebay are selling used ones for over $ 500 dollars. Do some research before buying and save a bit of money.
1,Poor Choice,I have had this camera from about 18 months. It has a horrible redeye problem even with the redeye flash turned on. Now it has stopped working altogether. It has developed the dreaded E18 error which means the lens will not come out when you open the camera. This has happened to a huge amount of these cameras; just search the web for the S30 and E18 code and you will see. Buy a different camera.
1,Review of Canon PowerShot s30,"The Canon S30 is overrated. I find that the shutter speed is really inadequate and I have missed some terrific moments because the performance isn't up to snuff. In general, I find the whole lens operation slow.I find that the slider button--for zoom/slideshow operation is actually quite difficult to use. And I have small fingers, to boot. I bought the camera in 2002 and the LCD is pretty scratched up, even though I keep it in a cushioned bag all the time. I have never dropped it or anything like that. Really not good for wear and tear.I am very disappointed with this camera, having heard such great things about it before I bought."
1,Just to weird to be true,"I eagerly purchased this book looking forward to another page turner from Mr. Harris, what I got instead was a book full of people who need psychiatric help. Camryn's obsession with her son's celibacy, to the point where she was lying to herself was just sick and weird also her son's need to pretend that he was perfect was also weird. WAAAYYY to wrapped up in each other's lives to be healthy. Mothers like that raise sons who are incapable of having relationships with anyone else without having Mommy call the shots. Ugh, I can't even finish it, I just put it down. I'll try the next one, but I'm done with this one."
3,Will always read E. Lynn's books,I love E. Lynn Harris but this book left me lost. There was not a clear ending to certain creators. What happen to his best friend and his mother? Is that a sequel? They just vanished in the end and I thought that was a great storyline. What about the baby and Naomi? I thought that was a great storyline--vanished. Even if I could get a blog at the end telling me to stay tune I would have been happy and this would be a hit. Now I am mad.
3,Not all that good to be true,I will start off by saying I am an avid fan and reader of E. Lynn Harris but this book was just not on point. I did read it in a day but not because it was a page turner. It was slightly suspenseful but nothing like a typical E. Lynn book. An old character does pop up here and there but nothing that true fans would appreciate. I'd say borrow this book from a quick and easy rainy day read.
4,Yet another good Bishop story,Kay Hooper continues the intrigue and suspense in her newest set of Bishop books.
3,Not Topnotch Sensation Fiction,"A contemporary of Wood's, a woman who was her fan, found her prosaic in her conversation and ideas, and that carries over in this novel which is too long and too slack. The story takes too long to catch fire and the characters simply don't have enough depth, though there are many touching and amusing moments. Wood is not a very good writer, not remotely in the league of Wilkie Collins of Elizabeth Braddon. When you read them, you want to read more of their oeuvre, having read one Wood novel, I'm done. I kept reading out of curiosity for she can come up with some entertaining plot twists, but there was less here than meets the eye. The introduction is thorough and fascinating, and objective; the notes are good (though sometimes too basic)."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I was unable to find this bulb in any of the local stores. Went on Amazon and found several distributors for this bulb for my desk lamp after the original had burnt out. This distributor had a fair shipping fee and the cost was near the lowest of the group, it arrived in less than a week in excellent condition."
4,Just okay,"It's a good quality decal, but the contrast between the silver and black shows better in the photo than in person."
1,"Back to the Mission, please.","Waiting for another album where Don can shine, and that's with Innocence Mission."
3,fun stacking blocks for toddler,"not the greatest sound, rather soft, but provide great entertainment for my toddler who thinks they are fancy building blocks!"
4,One of the best,"I have several Pilates videos and this is one of my favorites. I have had private lessons, and this DVD is the closest thing to my lessons. It seems that the other Pilates videos are made by instructors who do not focus on Pilates primarily but are just making a video to sell. As a result, the correct form is not maintained. Sometimes, it is not Pilates at all."
2,AMERICAN ADOBO IS TASTELESS,"bad acting, especially Dinaplain dialoguesi won't say don't waste your money on this. try it for yourself, and tell me what you think. :-)"
3,"Good, but not great.","One of the things that many of the reviewers here tend to forget is that while this movie was intended to be for a wider audience, only Filipinos would be able to understand the film the way it should be. American Adobo is a film that stands on its own by being the only Filipino film to undertake two cultures and try to blend it as one.The actors weren't horrible. The story was just like a lot of films today are - predictable. As for over acting, I can name several actors that are not Filipino that overact and yet are praised for it. Jim Carrey anyone? Mike Myers? Just to name a few.This movie is worth a purchase, but if you were expecting an Americanized film, you will sorely be disappointed. I'm 21 and while my friends who did watch this film disliked it, many others thought it was well worth the watch. Just have an open mind. I did."
3,Freeplay solar crank radio,Not a bad radio....does what it says...works on solar but needs cranked when sun goes behind a cloud. The only problem I have with it is when used in a moving vehicle turning corners the reception goes in and out. Would be great for the beach.
1,can't agree more with other reviewer...,"the reason so many hermit crabs suffer and die is because of pet stores selling completely unsuitable hermit habitats to novice owners. This set is totally unsuitable for more than a weekend trip-and NEVER use gravel with your hermies-they need clean ""play"" sand or better the calci sand sold here.Moisture is VITAL to a hermie-this is how they breathe! The mesh top is wrong and hazardous.If this is the only habitat you have currently, at least keep a moistened (in spring water) towel over the lid to keep the moisture inside.Save your money-get a 5 or 10 gallon aquarium with a glass lid and light, sand and something for them to climb on and hide in."
1,"Love Relacore, but not the seller DAB/Potential Dynamix","I've used Relacore before and love it. Ordered this time from Amazon, thru their listed distributor DAB Nutrition. But it says it's fulfilled by Amazon, so I ordered. It arrived quick, but the bottle and label appear discolored and old. I looked at the expiration date and it's more than a year expired! These pills are usually good for a couple years, so I'm quite disappointed. I will return the bottle and buy it elsewhere, but just be aware that (either by mistake or not) DAB Nutrition/Potential Dynamix has some old stock and poor quality control."
1,Hair Loss,"Yeah, for all of you people - keep taking the product you may experience the same results as I am now. After taking Relacore fore few weeks my hair started to fall out. It happened like over night the first day I lost two hand fulls of hair. I used to have long, thick hair. Now my hair is thin and you can see my scalp. Not only that it keeps falling out more. So, I am 30 years old and I am going bald. Read the label. It says hair loss. Be careful and stop talking it before its too late. I called customer service, they telling me to send back the pills and they will give me my money back. I don't care about that. I wanted to contact someone who knows if my hair will ever grow back. I was told that the hair loss side effect is written there just in case. That people never that these side effects. I went online, read customer reviews and I am not the only one who is losing hair. Some other side effects: fatigue, stomach cramps, drowsiness, not able to concentrate, acme, dry scalp."
5,great granola,"This is one of my favorite granolas, though it's a bit expensive. Like most granola, it's high in calories, but I sprinkle a little on either Cheerios or Kashi."
1,Hard Trip,Lousy Just a bunch opinions items of interest are almost completly lost about what the adult entertainment industry is like. The known facts are so muddy that this lacks clarity. I bought this DVD for part entertainment and education on the subject it fails on both accounts miserly.
5,Wood Frame Folding Hamper,"This is baby hamper is a good size and it has a removable nylon mesh bag, for you to take dirty laundry to the washing machine. An additional feature that would be useful, is to provide a product # so that it is possible to buy an additional nylon mesh bag, to replace the bag, while the dirty one is in the washer."
5,Other Bands Take Note,"What a fantastic album. I was a little young to really catch the glory days of what's tagged ""thrash metal"", and after hearing this I'm bummed that I did. At the same time, I'm more than excited that bands like Exodus are back tearing it up. I'll keep this simple. The vocals: they are just raw and vicious. All you death metal growlers sound so weak and contrived compared to the vocals on this album. You can just feel the power and anger. The guitar work...flat out fantastic. Catchy riffs, speed, heaviness, tempo changes, and solo after solo. It's everything you can't find in most of what's out there today. There is a similar feel to most songs but enough diversity in the music that you aren't bored. Drums and bass just pound you. I really think the production brings this out...needless to say it is produced by Andy Sneap. Like the man says in ""Tempo of the Damned""...""Give in to the Ministry of Sin"" Welcome back Exodus..."
4,"First Kreator, then Exodus...who'll be next?",Exodus has followed Kreator in regaining their rightful place at the golden thrash table. This album is a powerhouse with brutal riffs and beats abound and is definitely in line with their classic albums.
1,HOW ABOUT ... NO!,"Think tight leather pants ... too much makeup ... and a lead singer that sounds like a weezing asthmatic. In Flames, Hypocrisy, or Gardenian are all wise choices. If you are into darkness ... Dimmu Borgir is your speed. No offense to Exodus fans, but they are so 80's."
4,"Great guitar riffs, but are you serious with this vocalist?","Not really a review, just a quick observation. I love the song-writing and the musicianship on this album. However, this lead singer should never be allowed to approach a microphone ever again. This singer makes it impossible for me to listen to this album repeatedly.I just can't believe this guy was their best option. What a damn shame!"
5,WOW.........they're back and better than ever!!,"i bought this album the first day it came out and i was VERY excited cause exodus is back and i love a lot of thier music.when i finished listening to the album everything blew my head off.the guitars were buzzsawing 1000 miles per hour and the sound is like somethin you've always dreamed of,the vocals....ARE THE BEST!!!they are way better than steves ols vocals in the 80s they are raw and powerful and in the song impaler he spits and screams and makes the band very powerful with his new vocal sound(but i wonder what it would sound like live?)the druming and bass lines are just PERFECT with it combined it makes the ultimate sound.this is probably exoduses best,best since the bonded by blood album(yes,bonded by blood is still my fav).so you should get this if your starting to become and exodus fan or get this if your a long die hard fan of em."
3,A Real Turkey,"This book has good intentions, but it just wasn't thought out well enough. Vocabulary to the dialogues is not introduced where it should be; grammar is thrown in here and there without an explanation, which is highly confusing to any serious language learner. As a result of these shortcomings, the student finds himself turning pages and looking for vocabulary (which usually is not even in the glossary!) and looking for grammar explanations. It gives the learner the impression that the book was just slapped together with very little thought about sequential learning. I would encourage the authors to make vital changes in the next printing. Don't dumb it down, smarten it up! Just add more explanations and vocabulary in the right places. I have always enjoyed the Teach Yourself series for languages, but I have been disappointed by the books in recent years. Langenscheidt from Germany or Routledge grammars will probably serve you better, but they are a bit pricier."
2,very cheepy edition,"It seems that they tried to make a course book spending as little money as possible. It is full of typos, sometimes they just forget the translation of the introduced vocabularly (e.g. chapter 3 dialogue 2) and you have to look about it at the dictionary. In every chapter, they introduce new vocabulary in exercises as isolated words (e.g. even root verbs!!) instead doing so inside the main text and then they expect that you remember it. The terminology they use when they explaining grammar is a jargon that makes anybody that has finished Middle school very annoyed. Not being unfair, I am at chapter 4 and I've enjoyed it till now, but I will continue with another course book."
3,Republished with the same errors!,"A great product to start with, don't get me wrong ... but the publishers really lose all credibility when the same typos appear in the new edition, even though it's been thoroughly rebranded and redesigned."
5,Brought me back to my youth,Great quality for a VHS tape. A perfect replacement for the one that got ruined in a wet basement!
4,"For One Brief, Shining Moment...","... the world enjoyed the genius of Goober and the Peas. The studio recordings never matched the energy of their live performances, which for my money, still rank among the best shows I've ever seen. I saw them quite by accident at the Khyber Pass, in Philadelphia, on a night when the Rev. Horton Heat failed to show up due to car trouble. Goober and the boys were hanging out following a gig at another club, and when they learned that the Rev. was a no-show, Goober bribed the club honchos to let them play. Out of nowhere, this band of urban cowpokes took the stage, and with a burst of electric guitar and fistfuls of hay, these blokes blew the room away with their signature tune, ""Funky Funky Cowboy!"" What a night. Buy the CD and pray for the reunion tour."
4,Enjoyable Follow-Up,"I enjoyed this film, but don't think it was as good as the first one. It's a little slow on getting to the action, and doesn't give Micky Rourke enough screen time. All in all it was an enjoyable follow-up to the first movie, just not filled with many surprises."
2,Iron Man 2,"I LOVED the first one. This one had its moments but it was TOO BORING! Too much Tony Stark and not enough Iron Man if you know what I mean. I loved the last 30 minutes. The fight scene was great, but the overall movie IMO was a bust!"
2,Iron Man Combo Pack rules!,My son could not decide between the Iron Man 2 Movie on Blue Ray or DVD. I came across the combo pack at Amazon and was so excited. It also comes with a Digital copy. All this for only 24.99 It is a great deal! Good movie and now he has three forms of it. We are very pleased with this purchase.
3,It's not the WORST Marvel movie...,"I'm not crazy about it, but I felt the need to be up to date on the better superhero movie franchises, and Iron Man is definitely one of the better ones. At least it's not Daredevil (or Elektra, or Fantastic 4, or Spiderman 3, or The Hulk, or The Green Lantern...I could go on, but I think you get my point)."
2,Lacks newness of the original,"Robert Downey Jr. returns as the superhero with a new foe, the son of his Father's former partner. This leads to the usual exciting finale of the battle between the hero and the villain. The film lacks the sense of discovery that the first Iron Man had, with Tony Stark's Iron Man now a well-known public figure. The introduction of Scarlett Johansson as a karate expert is a welcome addition to the franchise, as her character kicks some serious booty. Overall, disappointing. The first was much better. Seeing Iron Man put the suit together and emerge as a superhero was what made the original exciting. This one is just a below average action film."
4,Great Blockbuster Movie,Those who liked the first movie will love this one.The only thing I took a star away for was the digital copy required internet connection for authorisation and after an annoying length of time due to multiple popups I found the file was .wmv. The very poor compression rate this format provides means awful picture and sound quality when played on a big screen hd tv through a hardware media player. I deleted the file.
1,"First not bad, second a waste of good resources","Had a good cast and so much potential. Story very poor and direction, none. Get someone like JJ Abrams to direct and it will surely be better. New writers urgently required for the next version. RD jr, was great in Sherlock, but nothing worked in this film, timing was way out. The Stark Expo was absolutely silly. One for young children, nothing for anyone over 12."
1,Another Bad Sequel,The original was a good movie. Version 2 didn't engage my attention for more than three seconds.
1,Sequels rarely turn out well,"I think actors get too excited/confident if the original movie does well and decide they want to put on a really good show the next time. Or maybe it's the director because everything in this movie fails; the acting and special effects, were well over done. So disappointing: Downey, Rourke and Cheadle are three of my favorite actors. Hopefully this isn't the end."
5,Great,Great response time. Ordered it monday and received it on saturday. Shipped with receipt and thank you letter. Thanks for the magnet and pencil. Your welcome for the business.
3,"Iron Man Fan boy, but Its only OK...","I'll start off by saying I love comics. I own them, I watch every cartoon and movie about them (within reason), even down to Voltron. Yes Voltron.The loved the first Iron Man. It was a good and fun movie that launched this franchise. This one however, I'm not a big fan of. Lots of action and humor, but it was just good. Not great, not bad either.Should you spend a couple of hours watching it? If you have Netflix or Instant Video, sure go for it. Its free. I wouldn't suggest you invest in buying it however.I can go into a lot of details about Plot, and stupid things in there, but take it from an Iron Man fan that its just Meh and not worth more than few bucks."
5,What Happens Next...,"This film is a great sequel to the original. The story is good. Placing Don Cheedle (sp?) was a great choice. This is so much more than a pop corn film. You want the hero to win. The bad guys to die. Everybody can enjoy this film. BTW, a good surround system is great with this Blu-Ray..."
2,Big letdown.,I can't add anything that hasn't been already stated. The scene where the Ironman suit gets stolen by somebody who has never stepped inside of one before made me cringe.The scenario is so typical now...sequels to blockbuster's are just half-assed thrown together because they know theye are gonna make money regardless. At least it was only wasted NF rental for me.
2,Overhyped + Brief fighting scenes + More about Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman,"This movie spent more time depicting Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman's achievements. That made it more like a drama. Yet, it's a half-baked drama because it's not given enough time to move me. Just when the drama was building up, it moved to the action scenes. However, these were too brief to provide excitement. For example, the fighting at the race track looked good but it ended too quickly. The last action scenes with hundreds of Ironman clones looked like cartoon.There were less funny dialogues than the first film.Overall, this picture is over-hyped."
4,Iron Man 2 rocks,"Amazing film, where Robert Downey once again proves himself as the real Tony Stark. Mandatory item in any collection."
5,Iron Man 2,Iron Man 2 was very entertaining and kept you interested. It was action packed with good acting on all parts. I enjoyed it it as much as my grand kids did.
3,Nothing like the first one.,"It seemed like there was too much going on. I had to rewind a couple of times to figure out how the characters tie into each other. I have always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr, but never too pleased knowing about his substance abuse which seems to play into this movie. Overall, the movie was not done very well."
3,Really a cash making dud,"When this movie came out, I was anticipating so much more. Instead, I got a movie that was dull witted, obvious, and at times just plain stupid. I mean, Iron Man ends with Iron Man fighting with another Iron Man. This movie brings us... Iron Man fighting 100 other Iron Men."
5,super buena!!,"esta pelicula esta mucho mejor que la primera,en efectos y la calidad del sonido ademas con calidad de full HD se las recomiendo para disfrutarla en familia!!... :)"
3,Same story just different special effects,"I suspect that there will be an Iron Man 3, I just hope the story line is different next time. Once again, it's Iron Man vs. other iron man type villians. If it wasn't for the fact that this is about a classic comic book hero, I don't think this would have done so well."
2,A Tin Sequel,"More is less in a disappointing follow-up to the 2008 Marvel Comics blockbuster. ""Iron Man 2"" lacks the qualities that made the original so engaging. The inimitable Robert Downey Jr. and a stalwart cast are wasted in this overlong, badly paced superhero saga. Jon Favreau's once-sharp direction goes on autopilot - weighed down by Justin Theroux's needlessly cluttered, drawn-out script. Plenty of CGI overkill, yet precious little excitement. The already-planned ""Iron Man 3"" has nowhere to go but up."
4,Better than first Iron Man,"Liked original Iron Man, not great movie but told a good story detailing how Ironman came to be. I've usually found follow-up movies to be disappointing...too much added in and working too hard to make the hero(ine) seem less heroic and make up really dumb plots to do this. Iron Man 2 had some of this but I liked the way they did the story plot and it was a good fight at the end that was more plausible than most earlier super hero ones.Mickey Rourke made a good, believable (comic book) villain and Downey was truly great being the arrogant, pleasure seeking playboy that just wanted to have fun while tweaking the noses of his main competitor and the governmentSee it, you'll like it."
5,Purchased for my son as a christmas gift,"my 11 year old loves all the super hero movies and likes to watch them over and over again, so this made for a great gift"
4,Great movie!,We really enjoy watching The Iron Man series. It's a good movie for kids and adults. We ordered it for Christmas and it arrived in a timely manner.
4,good buy,"the movie is fun, scarlette is hot gwyneth is hot, the seller got it to me very quick and very cheap overall great purchase would do it all again in future thanks!!"
1,Narcissism personified,"Though the original Iron Man was worth watching, this movie was truly terrible; anyone frustrated by the arrogance of others in real life will loathe this film. As soon as I watched it, I gave it away to the kids of a colleague who like comic books."
5,Great Stuff - the starter kit to venture capital,"super to get started with the whole ""financing methodology"" - absolutely worthwhile reading. A must for everyone getting started in that area"
1,Pamphlet,Pamphlet size. Not a book. Not worth $3. Looks like something that came out of a cereal box for free that you would dispose of after one reading.
2,Shortest 18inch Chain Ever,"I am pretty sure I asked for an 18 inch chain and I received what might be a 14inch chain. All that aside, it is a lovely chain, nice quality for the price, fairly sturdy, good clasp. Be careful in requesting your size."
2,Good book but difficult.,"I will agree with the reviewer that said ""stick to the originals"" This book touched on the ideas found in the later books and was a hodge podge of other matierial and became hard to get through the book. Otherwords, it became somewhat of a chore to get the book read. The other books are much better, although this book is not terrible."
1,left me behind,"I've never read Don Miguel Ruiz, but this book is no enticement. When someone with a poor grasp of basic science starts to use (or abuse)scientific terms (e.g. ""condensed light""), I find it hard to stay with them, even if I try to read it as allegory rather than scientific fact. So much pseudo-science here, I just lost all trust."
4,go to the source!,"Go and get a book called ""tales from the time loop"" by David Icke! It covers all this and much more! One of the best books to come around in decades..."
1,Oh lordy..... No No No,"I truly don't understand these positive reviews!!You could certainly call me a Miguel Ruiz follower, considering I've devoured each of his books, leaving the margins covered with notes and bracketed passages. The underlying message of perfection, along with the analysis of domestication has truly opened my mind to living life ""BEYOND FEAR"". But oh my God, what the hell is this book?I was expecting a continued dialogue of his eye-opening philosophies, but instead I was bombarded with whack-job theories about civilizations far preceding ours with nuclear power? WHAT???I'm sorry, It's like any religion.. Drop the Dogma, get down to the heart of what needs to be said....This book was a complete dissapointment (spoken from a guy who will be re-reading Don Miguels books for ages)"
1,Was this book even authorized by don Miguel Ruiz?,This book was horrible!!! If I was don Miguel Ruiz I would sue her. I have read his books and always felt enlightened by his teachings. Reading this 1)I could not get into it and 2)I felt betrayed because don Miguel Ruiz really rocks & she is psycho. Do not buy this book.
1,I think this is the new Adam Sandler CD,"This was the worst thing that I have ever heard. No I didn't buy the record, Thank God. Seriously though if you want a good laugh listen to the samples they offer, especially the second song. I actually had to bring my girlfriend in the room so she could listen to it. She then responded ""What the hell is that? God , turn it off.""I'm going to disagree with the reviewer who said to buy this only if you're a die hard fan. If you do buy this well then you will be dying hard."
3,"Red, Hot and Eclectic","This CD can be enjoyed by those wanting to hear good music played by interesting bands. If you are wanting to compare it to The Smiths, don't bother this isn't a wedding band cover album. However, if you'd like to hear well written songs performed by modern bands then try it out it's a collection that indie fans will appreciate."
3,An OK timer,"It works ok, BUT, it is very hard to hear over the sound of the kitchen exhaust fan. We also bought a Presto Timer, which is much louder, and better for kitchen uses. The Taylor timer is fine if you carry it with you."
3,Taylor Digital Minute/Second Timer,"Small and inexpensive, it does what it needs to do, but is neither sturdy nor loud. Since it has a clip, best to clip it to your sleeve so you will hear it when it rings! However, should you drop it, be prepared to have it fall apart, and be prepared to put the battery back and re-start..."
3,Died after two years,I did not use this timer much but it recently died. I thought the battery was dead but when I replaced it the display would not work correctly. I would not recommend if your looking for something to use for a long time.I did like that it had a quieter alarm than some other timers. I had it close by and did not need to hear it over a distance.
2,0.7-Inch LCD,"Pros:The 0.7-Inch LCD display is 0.7 inches high, and 1.3 inches measured diagonally. Readable from 9-10 feet away.Cons:It is very cheaply made and doesn't last long if you use it much. The magnet broke, the spring hook is barely strong enough to hang on. It lasted five months for me.Cheap Chinese junk. I took it apart after it quit working, and it was never reliable after putting it back together.Fragile Chinese junk. Flexing the case resets the clock. And it is hard not to flex the case, it is so thin.The alarm can barely be heard in the same room, and cannot be heard in the next room."
3,okay for the price,"how to power it off? I keep taking the battery out, had it for 2 weeks now, like it. beep is just loud enough, doesn't give a panic attack like lots of other timers do. display is a nice size."
1,Bad Quality,"The bottom half of the display stopped working after a couple weeks of light usage. Before that though, it worked fine as a kitchen timer. If you don't want to buy a new one every month, you should spend your money on something higher quality."
1,"Junk, lasted two cycles before LCD row burned out","I thought it was just the battery, but the entire 2nd horizontal row burned out, making it unreadable within MINUTES of using! Literally 5 minutes use and its junk. Needs a reset button (To reset time, need to pause, then hit M and S together. Rather flimsy device. If I didnt throw away the packaging, I would have returned it to the store - although driving it back would cost as much in gas & burn up an hour of my day. MADE IN CHINA. I should have learned by NOW!"
2,"Barely audible tone, small LCD","This timer was a disappointment. The alarm tone is very difficult to hear from another room, to some extent defeating the purpose for which I bought it. LCD can only be read from up close and at limited angles. Upside is conveninece of magnet and adjustable stand, giving options for placement. Still, cannot recommend."
1,short lived,"The alarm is too low. The upper half of the display dissapeared after two weeks, and a new battery did not fix. It is going in the trash. Hope your luck is better."
3,Cheap,"This is exactly what it is...a cheap timer. The alarm wasn't loud enough for me, so I gave it to a friend. It does the job, easy to use, decent size display, but the sound need to be improved.Keep that in mind, but if you want a quiet simple timer, it's a good bet."
1,"Not a fan, spills everywhere when pouring.","We have had this coffee pot for only a month. It was a gift, though I wish we could return it. I have had no problems with the clock and setting the brew time works fine. When you lift the top up to take out the filter, the water vapor leaks all down the back of the machine. Our biggest complaint would be that each time we pour the coffee it spills and gets coffee all of the counter. I have tried a variety of ways of pouring it.. nothing changes the spilling and it's extremely frustrating!"
2,carafe doesn't stay in plcae causing spills,"This coffe maker makes decent enough coffee but has a glaring flaw. The cutoff for the basket has a spring on it that will actually move the carafe so that flow is stopped, causing coffee and grounds to spill over, making a big mess. Not a good design."
3,Reliable little camera,"Bought this camera years and years ago and it's still working. Takes nice point and shoot pictures, but does eat up batteries and storage space when taking movies. Decent resolution on images, audio not so great for the movies. One of the reasons I bought a second camera as this one only has a 3x Optical zoom. So its good for relatively close pictures (say across the street), but not so good for distance shots (like a bird flying overhead.) I do take this camera with me to parties and such as it's a lot easier to carry than the bigger ones with the higher optical zooms. This would make a good beginner camera for someone."
4,Good so far...,"For the price, this pan has so far served me very well. I've only had it for a month or so, so I suppose it may wear out, but at the moment it's an excellent pan. And at this price, it doesn't exactly have to last a lifetime, either."
2,Not Worth Ordering,Very light weight and the non-stick surface does not work well. Spend more and go for a better skillet.
5,Farberware Skillet,I am totally happy with the service and the skillet. I purchased it because I like making 1 pan meals and this fry pan is perfect.
3,Well Written: Unethical Anthropologist,"This book draws you in, but not for the reasons it should. Good is by far the best anthropologist writer I have yet to encounter. However if you are looking for meaty anthropological theory about the Yanomamo go elsewhere except for the few mentions of Marvin Harris and Napoleon Chagnon. If you are looking for a well written account of a confused anthropologist who should NOT have accepted a young indian girl as a wife while he was supposed to be doing social science, here you have it. It is a big disappointment to anthropology as a profession and social science that Mr. Good did take a young lady as a wife and his behavior is an example in what anthropologists should NOT do. So the book is in a sense good fodder for debate on anthropological ethics."
2,Not Good,"No problem setting up. Turn it on brews then turns off. The bad, The carafe pours very slowly and drips. I have not managed to brew a decent tasting cup of coffee yet. At least not as good as the $15.00 pot it replaced. I got it on sale at Macys for $28.00 and still don't feel it was worth it. I am going to buy something else and toss this one."
5,Good Omens,A great ride threw Doomsday. Its a cross between The Hitcher's Guide to the Galaxy and the Omen. One of the best books put out by Terry Pratchett.
5,Absolutely!,"Absolutely! more than met my expectations. Arrived promptly, great condition and I thoroughly enjoyed the book-what a twist!Interesting that each of these book is ""registered"" with a number to track where they go (World Book Night Edition)"
4,Laughing at the end of the world,"The end of the world is at hand, and the forces of Heaven and Hell are preparing for the final battle of Good vs. Evil. Unfortunately, the representatives of both Heaven and Hell have grown rather fond of Earth in general, and humans in particular, and decide that they would prefer not to have it all end. Unfortunately, the Antichrist was misplaced at birth, causing confusion among the gathering forces. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ride forth on their motorcycles and the end of creation seems at hand.Written with an ineffable sense of humor, this book manages to make the end of the world fun, a farce that will leave the reader giggling, if not laughing out loud. Very entertaining."
4,Hilarious!,"What do you get when you combine an award-winning humor author with an award-winning fantasy author? An award-winning humorous fantasy book that plays off the strengths of both contributors. This is an amazing collaboration that lives up to everything it should be. It's got an interesting plot, great characters, hip spirituality, and the entire story is laced with jokes that had me laughing out loud.The only downside is the length of the book. Some parts dragged too much for my taste - I would have preferred a shorter, more intense and punchier story. (I do appreciate that it didn't become a series, though, as I prefer my novels standalone) As it is I still recommend it to many as a shining example of today's best British sci-fi/fantasy humor, right alongside Douglas Adams' fantastic ""Hitch-hiker's Guide"" series."
5,YES! YES! YES!ABSOLUTELY THE MOST HILARIOUS BOOK ON EARTH.,"I've always been a fan of unusual books, and this one is, Hands Down, THE weirdest book I've read to date! I just wish they would make a movie out of it. The two protagonists(Crowly&Aziraphale;Crowly is the former serpent from the garden of Eden, Aziraphale is the guardian of the gate) make an extremely hilarious pair, even though the whole basis of the book is Apocalyptic. You know those rare books that come along, the ones that you just can't get the scenes out of your head and you HAVE to go and read certain parts OVER & OVER, This is one of those books.The humor is scattered throughout the book, and occasionally it's hard to get if you don't go back and re-read parts. My mom just read the first chapter and liked it. I just hope that those few people who think a sequel is possible are right...Yet Again, KarliBear & Baby Godzilla"
4,Terry Pratchett fans will like it! Best Neil Gaiman book I've ever read!,"Hilarious, witty, constant laughs and very smartly written.Unfortunately it confirmed a fear of mine. I have tried, but I just don't like Neil Gaiman's writing. This is by far the best of the books with his name on it I read, but the parts I liked had Terry Pratchett's signature all over them...had it not been for Terry I don't think I'd like it at all.Moral of the story - if you like Terry Pratchett, you'll probably like this book. If you like Neil, you might anyway."
1,"Run don't walk, away from this book.","If you have read all of the other reveiws of this book you can now disregard them. The reveiwers must be serious binge drinkers. If your expecting Douglas Adams type humor in this book you'd be better of finding it in an L. Ron Hubbard book. I am a fan of Neil Gaiman's and thoughly enjoyed Neverwhere and his Sandman graphic novels, but this book was not in his style, and not up to par with his other works. This book was very predictable to say the least. The humor was stale, and the characters were lame. Save your money. This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on."
5,This mix of Pratchett's comedy and Gaiman's lore is amazing!,"A very funny book with a beautifully irreverent view of religion that at the same time mocks and carefully twists elements therein. A masterpiece of various styles of comedy, from the classic British deadpan throwaway asides to the more obvious repeated jokes. The twisted characters range from the sarcastic, to the deadpan, the innocent fool, to the totally obvious caricatures that all serve to add to a very easy to follow, yet non-obvious travelling plot.Well, that all aside, I made a total fool of myself in the middle of a crowded study hall reading this book back in college, and I still have to carefully think of where I am when I read this book, because I can't recall a book that has made me laugh more, even when I know that I shouldn't be laughing...The product of Pratchett's comedic style mixed with Gaiman's incredible grasp of mythology and religion is a masterpiece work."
3,Totally overrated,"It's Holy Grail meets The Omen. Very clever conceit/premise with a few funny scenes scattered throughout. In general, however, I found the writing to be subpar and the characters were only vaguely fleshed out (except for Crowley and Az). Most of the time I could actually hear the authors patting themselves on the back for being so clever. Ugh. Not sure why everyone raves about this book. I haven't read the other Neil Gaiman books so not sure if this is a typical effort or if I have Terry Pratchett to blame."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"One of the funniest starts to book, ever. That is a good enough reason to read it. As far as I am concerned, this is Gaiman's best prose work, I suppose that fact that he had such talented help on the comedy front might discount that somewhat, if you do not know who actually did what. Anyway, this is often hilarious."
3,Almost Douglas Adams-quality,"Finally a Gaiman/Prachett book I could read to the end. Discworld puts me to sleep; this novel kept my interest & amusement enough for me to finish. Anyone reading it should find it funny enough, but not as good as Douglas Adams... The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse are the best touch."
3,Not my style.,I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.He and I obviously have vastly different tastes. I gave it 3 starsbecause we are friends. I am now wondering why.
4,Awesome,"Been a fan of Pratchett for years, just started reading Gaiman at the behest of my girlfriend, and I must say, I'll probably be reading more by him in the future. Good Omens is definitely worth the read."
5,"Oh god, this book again","I honestly refuse to live in a house without this book in it as well, and since I lost my last copy, I suppose it's a good thing that it was so cheap here. I've been rereading this book for going on ten years now and I haven't gotten around to getting tired of it, or even to not laughing too much while reading it. I'll just leave you with what I tell everyone about Good Omens- just shut up and go read it, you ninny. You'll enjoy the hell out of it. And if you don‘t? Well. Nerts to you, then."
4,"Great book, just wish Amazon's Kindle Store Hadn't Messed up...","Yet another book that was initially offered with a Kindle edition but whose Kindle edition has since gone poof! and disappeared.... I should have bought it in Barnes and Noble when I saw it, but had decided to wait until I got home to buy it on my Kindle2. This is more a review of Amazon. As for the book, it has fantastic, glowing reviews all over the place, and the sample I had downloaded sucked me right in..."
2,Potential unrevealed.,"The book had great potential with respect to plot and characters. It DID have some very funny dashes of wit - presumably c/o Pratchett's input no doubt. However, I found the story rather monotone, predictable, and uneventful throughout.How could two such talented writters come up with this stroke of syrup? Honestly, I couldn't believe how terribley disappointed I was when I had finished it.I obviously don't recommend it, because it was terribly BORING."
2,Well...,"Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, but these two guys were trying way too hard to be Douglas Adams, and it shows. For starters, they fail miserably. Imitation is the best form of flattery but outright plaigarism is illegal. A handful of funny bits but essentially nonsensical. Decent, brain-dead fare for a long train trip, but you'll be throwing it right in the bin once you arrive at your destination. You'd be much better of with a 'Hitchhiker' book."
3,mediocre,"I read this book with an open and hopeful mind, but was happy to be finished with it so I could move on to something else. It certainly did not live up to the hype. Did the book have some humorous moments? Absolutely. But they were diluted in the midst of heaping piles of overly 'witty' and not actually funny text. This is a case of authors that tried too hard to be oh so clever and funny, and shot themselves in the foot."
5,early disney,My granddaughter will like it. I seen it when I was a kid and thought I would get it for her to watch.
4,Sound advice for Ordinary Folk,"Though not as funny as 'The Henry Root Letters' and 'The further letters of Henry Root', this book will have you giggling quietly to yourself for hours.Root applies his British sense of humour and subtle sarcasm to the political and social issues of his day, and gives us invaluable guidance on the matters on which mankind has pondered, if not since the dawn of time, then at least since the invention of post-prandial coffee and agreeable company.Emerging breathless from that previous sentence, I would like to recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed the 'Letters' and I lament the fact that there isn't an online version. Now there's a thought..."
2,Not crazy for this timer,"I do not like this timer. I thought the keyboard would be nice so that I wouldn't have to keep pushing the button to insert the time, but after it goes off it resets to zero so that you have to re-enter the time each time. Also, the alarm is unpleasant and does not ever turn off after a preset time."
1,Vista upgrade will cost you a ton of money. need to wait.,"I bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer. I tried to install and half way through the set up, after it had uninstalled my old programs, I got a message to abort. The abort left me with a damaged media program, and thus far I have spent over $400 trying to re-connect damaged files and programs. My best advice is to wait until Microsoft gets the ""kinks"" out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade."
2,Wait if you can,The Vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades.
1,Don't Get Suckered By Microsoft,"Another horrible product by MicroSatan. XP is much better, and much faster. If you love to waste your time and money, buy this junk. I'm sure that little freak (bill gates) would love to take your money, and, as usual, provide horrible customer service. If you have XP, keep it. Or save your money and buy a Mac."
5,Strong plate that will hold a lot of weight and eco-friendly too,These plates are generously sized with a good lip around the edges so you can put any food on without risk of it sagging or the food rolling off as soon as it tips a little.
3,"well, Speedo doesn't make one...","I searched for a long time to find a ""racing"" style suit for swimming laps while pregnant. This one was the best I found. I ended up wearing it with a bikini top underneath as the top was extra big. It is totally unflattering, but as I said I bought it to swim laps. Functional, reasonably well made, and decent price. I hope it lasts for the next pregnancy!"
3,Baggy Maternity Suit,"Pros: Probably the most comfortable piece of maternity apparel that I own.Cons: Has absolutely no shape to it (picture a box with 5 holes cut out). Also, while I swim I can feel the drag that comes from pulling a parachute full of water behind me....but I guess I'm getting an extra workout from it!"
4,Works as it should,Smooth changing gears. Works as promised. I bought it to replace Shimano HG50-8. I did not like Shimano HG50-8 since it has 11t 13t and does not have 12t. Really I am not very happy with SRAM PG830 because it does not have 13t. I need 13t too. However absence of 13t is less irritating than missing 12t.
4,Great Price. More Than Decent Product.,"I installed this 8 or 9 months ago and haven't had any problems thus far. I only give 5 star reviews to things that surprise me or go beyond my expectations. So, you know: it's SRAM, it's decent quality, it will get your commuter bike and forth without disappointment."
5,Great Product!,Great product. My doctor recommended sublingual B-Complex for beri beri (lack of thiamin resulting in tingling sensation in fingers and hands). Worked very well for me.
2,Total disappointment,"Wow, I really hate Vista. Slow as can be. I just bought a brand new Gateway PC with the most powerful dual core processor available. I have huge amounts of memory and an excellent graphics card. My computer is so slow, even though I closed Aero and all the other fancy stuff that makes it look cool. It seems like the computer is trying to run 100 programs at once, even though only 2 or 3 are open. Programs keep crashing. And what in the world is the Windows Desktop Manager? It keeps messing up and closing my programs while I'm working. My husband and I really want to downgrade to XP, which ran our programs much more smoothly, but we are reluctant to pay the money to buy the full version after spending so much on a computer with Vista. If you have XP, don't waste your money upgrading until you've done some research and are sure you want to take the chance."
1,SLOW!!,"Buyers Beware!! This OS came with my new Dell Laptop, and it is so slow. Boot time is about 2-3 minutes. Opening a folder sometimes takes up to 10 seconds. Installing software and updating via broadband takes an eternity. I couldn't stand it anymore after about a week of use and had to go back to XP which I thankfully have a copy of because no more of my money is going to microsoft after this vista garbage of an os."
1,Embarrassing POC,If they hand out laptops in hell I'm sure they have Windows Vista installed on them. Keep in mind the 5 or 10 people who actually produced this load are allowed to write reviews on here as well.
1,Terrible,"My experience with Vista has been terrible. It was the only option when I bought my laptop so I had no choice. It seems very unstable and crashes all the time. It freezes on me on average about once a day, causing me to boot down my computer by holding the power button down, which isn't good for the laptop. The Aero interface looks nice, but it's totally unnecessary and takes up too much ram. I am probably going to ""upgrade"" to XP. It's familiar and stable. Linux is also an option, but I only have basic experience with it and don't want to dual boot quite yet. So anyway, if you are on the fence about Vista, don't do it. Wait awhile until it's more stable."
4,"Good, Not great","Upgraded from XP to Vista. Seems to be a smoother operating system. Fewer steps for setups and to keep the computer system working. Nicer screen displays. Watch out for Windows security that can be intrusive into other software like setting up your wireless router and adapter. Turned it off to use my own antivirus and firewall software. Currently Vista does not support wireless hubs for USB printers while XP does, I am told. Go figure. New format in drop down screens looking at directories and files takes some getting used to but then so did the dos prompt. Have Vista on two computers and like the operating system in general."
1,Why didn't I buy a Mac?,Just got my new laptop with Vindows Vista. First impression - even the simplest tasks take hours to figure out! BUGS BUGS BUGS everywhere. Slow and unresponsive on a dual-core with 3G of ram! Thinking of returning the laptop and getting a Mac.
1,lacking features I've enjoyed for a decade = a downgrade,"I'm a gamer. I enjoy games like Thief, which make use of 3D sound. With Vista, they removed the DirectSound EAX functionality. This means that even if your hardware supports EAX (like the integrated RealTek stuff does), you'll get lousy stereo sound in these games. This is pathetic.If you want to go buy one of the shiny new Creative sound cards, you can use their proprietary application to restore EAX functionality. RealTek has a program called 3DSoundBack which is supposed to re-enable EAX on RealTek chips, but this program is at version 0.1 Beta and did absolutely nothing when I tried it."
1,Get Windows 7,"My computer developed problems. Instead of moving up to Windows 7, I decided to re-install Vista Home Premium. Bad choice. It is not the same as the orginal factory installed Vista Home Premium. A lot of things that were orginally included are missing on this 'Full' version. So, if you're looking restore your computer to just like it was when you bought it...forget it."
1,"Whatever you do, don't ""upgrade"" to this pile of &%#@!!!","Pathetic performance, near-universal incompatibility with external applications and hardware, and nonexistent technical support; what more could anyone ask?If you've got Windows XP on your computer already, KEEP IT THERE. If you're getting a new computer, you need to consider buying a Mac (like I eventually did). No amount of tinkering by Microsoft is going to make Windows Vista worth the effort of learning.This is, without doubt, the techno-turkey of the decade."
1,Compatible or not Compatible that is the question?,"Microsoft released Windows Vista without consideration of its compatibility with existing software and there is a enormous number of programs that have problems running on Windows Vista including some programs Microsoft specifically designed to run on Vista.I've had Windows Vista for about 6 months and wish I did'nt. My scanners were not compatible and my Sony memory stick was not compatible. I sent Microsoft a note asking what I needed to do to download pictures from my memory stick onto the computer running Vista. Microsoft said ""Have Sony fix it.""So far I'm finding more software that is not compatible then is compatible.My advise is do not buy Vista for about 3 years. Give microsoft time to get the bugs out or at least give software companys time to write programs that are Compatible."
1,Bloody awful !,"Have worked with Windows since Win95 and I have to say this is the WORST operating system I've ever seen. This OS has become an administrator's nightmare. Locations of commonly-used functions have been strewn all over the place, impossible to find and every admin-related task requires secondary confirmations before execution. My first two hours trying to just get the OS to cooperate revealed several internal software bugs, even for the easiest and most common of user tasks. This is truly the bloatware of all bloatwares and the most OBNOXIOUS - if you are new to computers, get a Macintosh or go with Linux. If you're using an earlier version of Windows, avoid upgrading to this OS if at all possible. XP is the LAST Windows I'll ever use... as a veteran programmer and general computer n-e-r-d, Linux is gonna be the way to go in the future. Take notes Microsoft... you're screwing up big time!!"
1,Vista will not network with XP,"I just bought a new Sony notebook for my son who is going to college in September. Vista Home Premium was pre installed on the Sony. Plugged it into my home network, whidh has 3 XP machines on it. The XP machines network fine. The Vista machine does not see the XP machine and the XP machines do not see the vista.After an hour and 45 minutes on the phone with Sony they announced that they do not deal with network issues.45 minutes on the pnone with Linksys and they told me the issue was not related to network equipment.Microsoft charged me $79 for support. I was on the phone with them for over 3 hours. I went through 3 levels of support the first two from India. The third level was from the US, but seemed genuinely puzzled.My advice is do not buy Vista if you have any plan of networking your visat machine with an xp machine."
2,"XPish,.. now twice as annoying","I realy wanted to like this OS. I just find it typical MS annoying though. I had to turn off the UAC and now am constantly annoyed by having done so. Its now a mindless button to click to other users. I could suggest much much better ways to handle this but would rather give advice and support to Linux as it is appreciated.I predicted by 2015 Open office and Linux will be on a equal technical footing with MS type products and only major stagnant corporations will continue to renew with Microsoft. YES Vista is just that lack luster.I find this OS just impedes programs, where it is not customizable to reduce annoyances. As I right this I am told the UAC is turned off again. OS X can now be hacked to run on PC's and I'm not looking back...."
2,One of the most experimental albums I've heard,"This Free Jazz session features Cecil McBee on bass, Norman Connors on drums and Sam Rivers on piano, Sax, flute and screams. The Screaming solos remind me of Hermeto Pascoal. The flute solos remind me of Ornette Coleman and Hermeto. And the piano part reminds me of Cecil Taylor. One of the most tense and abstract jams i've heard. But I still prefer his ""Contours"" album, featuring Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Ron Carter and Joe Chambers."
4,Courtesy of Kids @ Teens Read Too,"In this short board book by award winning actor, author, and comedian Billy Crystal, a grandfather eagerly awaits the arrival of his granddaughter. Told in simple rhyme, we read along as grandpa anticipates meeting this new daughter of his daughter's.From the joy of that first moment of seeing a new grandbaby, to the excitement of teaching her to fish, fly a kite, tie her shoes, and taking her to see her first movie, the anticipation and love shine through bright and clear.This would be the perfect gift for any soon-to-be grandfather, or a book simply to be enjoyed by young children.Reviewed by: Jennifer Wardrip, aka ""The Genius"""
2,Stuck on the Music challenge,"My five year old son and I played this together (he has to have my help because there is a lot of reading). We had a good time progressing through the challenges until we got to the musical bone guy. I spent three hours trying to get past him with no luck (my son fell asleep he was so bored). We can't progress any further. The tips online all say to practice, but I don't want to waste anymore of my time. This game is essentially worthless to us now, and we've only had about two hours of game time out of it."
3,shiver me timbers matey,"This game is about a boy pirate seeking the riches on treasure island. It is meant for youngsters and is most appropriate for those in upper grade school to middle school. The levels are somewhat of a puzzle to solve in that you need to figure out what steps to take to complete each level. The levels are short and generally pretty easy once you figure out what has to be done. It does become a little more difficult once you reach treasure island.The gist of the game is to find the treasure chests on each of the first 16 levels and retrieve the item inside. Once these are all gathered your enemy boss is produced. He protects treasure island and attempts to defeat you. You move around or obtain items by pointing and clicking on the wand or by shaking it. You use the items to help you obtain other items, to reach other areas and to complete the actions required to solve the level."
3,Zack & Wiki Quest for Barbaros' Treasure,I got this game as a present.. Well let me say... I guess it got good reviews but I feel like I lose brain cells every time I play it.. There is a plot... But the goo and gaa makes me nuts... Besides the main characters annoying habit of eating chocolate every ten seconds... If you have brain cells and want to keep them I would say not the game for you...
5,THE PRINCIPLES OF VIRTUE VS POWER,"A Teacher tries to help all of his students learn how to be good citizens and serve their country. One student is rebellious, but shows great promise, and the innovative teacher, Kevin Kline, takes unusual steps to inspire this student to achievement. Does he succeed? This film is an absorbing, suspenseful, foray into the formation of character, and the principles of virtue vs power. There are moments of humor, but the film is true to life, and the way things really work in the real world."
1,Elitist Nonsense!,This movie to put it mildly is what is commonly referred to in the film industry as dodo. Seriously I found this film had no applications to these hectic postmodern times other than show how rich folks have their children educated to grow up and become a part of the blue blooded cast! I walked out on the part when the Caesar contest was held when they were all adults. I just couldn't take it anymore!
2,Very weak!!!,"If your expecting something with any depth, forget it! If you have a DM with an IQ higher than a carrot, you've already encountered every character type in this book."
3,This is a good book for the Races,This is a good book for people who like to play a Thief or a warrior. It also has a lot of intesting classes. The book could of gave more info about the races.
5,Nice thread,Huge spool of thread perfect for my couch slip cover project. I won't run out. It is hard to pick a color online luckily this neutral tone coordinates well with my fabric choice.
1,Not great but acceptable for the price to be fair,I didn't like it but to be fair it's accepted for $10. My problems with it are:1. It's bulky and heavy. (80s style)2. Projection only seen in dark and the focus function isn't quite enough to get it clear on mycieling3. If you like bright light in your room while sleeping then the standard digital clock is for you (I can't sleep like this)4. Controls are flimsy and so very old style5. You can't unset the alarm. You have to kill power to do that6. Works only on electricity (120 V) and the battery (not supplied) is to keep the clock from resetting when there is a black out.7. Even though the projector clock (the faint one) always resets to 1:00 when you unplug the power.If you need more quality look somewhere else for some extra money.
3,Disappointing-this book is only OK,"I really looked forward to getting this book but when I finally settled down with it I was disappointed. It lacks real depth and it DEFINITELY lacks breadth. This book should be titled ""Random Facts and Vague Histories of Some Molosser Breeds"". The book has left out WAY too many breeds to deserve its title. Many of the sections were lacking substance, especially the Fila Brasileiro, Tibetan and Spanish Mastiff sections. The author did do a good job covering the Mastiff and Bullmastiff, but there is a ton of literature out there already on those breeds. More focus on the rarities please!"
2,Publishing year was not made known!!,"I was very excited to get my book, as it is my first trip to Europe. I was very disappointed to get a book that is three years old (it is a travel manual) and an old Library book to boot! It was shipped fast though. My mistake I suppose, but it would have been nice if the info was EASILY found on the site where I was deciding to buy."
1,"Beware! Exact same text as ""But is it art?""","This is indeed a useful short introduction to art theory but do not buy it if you have read Freeland's ""But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory"". It is the very same book. As far as I've been able to check, the table of contents and the introduction are the same. Nowhere, however, does it indicate that it is a new edition of a previously published and still currently available book. Even the quote by Arthu C. Danto used in the editorial reviews here appears, incredibly, on the COVER of the other book!"
2,Not much info,I expected something interactive that would give a user something like a real exterience. The owner's manual is rather daunting and I wanted something simple that would get me familiar with the functions before I used the device on the water. Running the GPSMAP in simulation mode is better and is free with the product.
5,Two Bad Ants,"I read Two Bad Ants by Chris Van Allsburg. I liked and would recommend this book because I liked this book and it is hysterical and it has animals in it , also it is interesting. In the book I read many funny parts . For example ""Suddenly the disk they were standing on rocketed upward and the hot ants went flying through the air. This helped convince me that it was a good book."
2,A book for beginners and non-artists,"If you are looking for a book with lots of ideas and inspiration for working in polymer clay, this is not the one to buy. The first half of the book is devoted to techniques and would be helpful for the first time clay user, though there are very few photos to guide you.The projects in the second half are of the craft variety, a picture frame, jewelry box, etc. They would be great for beginners, but not very challenging or interesting for experienced artists.I returned this book within a half hour of receiving it."
2,"Messy, Gooey & Not Working","After reading the reviews I ordered this product hoping it would finally do the trick. It was a tiny little tub, like the size of a lip balm... not exactly ideal for treating a whole dog, unless it's only a very small patch of mange. The goop didn't really have an odor, but I found that once applied to the dog he got extremely dirty and smelly by that night. (???) Needless to say, the ointment is gone, the mange isn't. I would NOT recommend this product unless your dog only has a very small patch missing."
5,Have System = Must Buy This,If you have a system in your car and like the kind of Bass that makes your ears pop you gotta buy this CD. My car slams with all of the tracks especially the 65 Hrz. If you're a BassHead and like eye-bulging Bass this is calling your name.
4,Not a miracle - but it does help,"My cat suffers from severe allergies, often sneezing 10 times in a row. This product has helped calm down his sneezing quite a bit. He still sneezes, but not as often nor as many times in a row. I'll certainly continue to use it. The more I can control his allergies, the less trips we have to make to the vet. This remedy appears to have no side effects. I've been using it for 4 months."
4,Works for mild sinus condition,"I used the full contents of the container over the course of ~ a month. I gave 5 drops in canned food 3 times per day. My cat is healthier and happier without the sniffles and sneezing. Effective product as it is intended. By way of packaging, my box is not the box as pictured. It has pictures of a dog and cat with dark green and khaki colors. The product name ""HomeoPet"" is the same. The lid on product is poorly engineered."
4,Homeopathic Meds for Pets that catch a cold,"I had 2 younger cats in the house that caught a feline ""cold"" with sneezing and runny eyes. It worked very well for these 2 cats, but my senior cat who is about 17 years old caught this ""cold"" and this medicine did not work for him. I had to take him to the vet twice to get treated before he started recovering and getting better. He had it so bad that he did not eat for almost a week."
5,There is a God!!!!,"I've been a big fan of THE BOYS for a long time and have been waiting for their sound features and shorts to be available in DVD and now,they're here!!Or at least some of them.Let's just hope(and pray)that this won't be the last and they'll put every one out soon!! What would be even better(hope you guys are reading this)is if they added the foreign shorts/features,too along with the American versions...But,for now,this box set is perfect and hopefully there'll be more to come!! Thanks alot guys!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
1,NOT REMASTERED,"Hallmark owns the rights to the Laurel and Hardy sound films. They do not care about using the best available prints. The kirch Group in England only used the best available 35mm originals for their Laurel and Hardy dvds. We in America get a Dvd with added ""modern sounding"" music and a TV print, not the original masters. Hallmark does not care and will not respond to emails. I will not buy ANYTHING by Hallmark or Artisan until they get it right.Hallmark will not sell the rights to people who really would do something for the preservation and restoration of these films. These films have never been ""remastered"" in America. A very angry fan."
2,Again a misleading L&H DVD. This is Laurel OR Hardy solo efforts.,"While showing you a picture of the boys from 1935 when they were in top form as a comedy team, St Clair Vision instead gives you un-restored (sometimes incomplete) solo silent efforts from a decade of two earlier. These early works are better presented in the KINO Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy DVDs & Hal Roach's Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy DVD set."
3,Movies worth lots of lough but...,"Great shorts worth a thousand of laughs, as always when Hal Roach was a producer and Laurel and Hardy were in the prime. However, the quality of recordings (especially Sons of the Desert) - video and audio - were rather below par, and that's why my 3 stars."
2,Should be better,"While it is great to see ""The Boys"" on DVD, the quality is nowhere near as good as it should be. These are not the highly-praised German restorations, but are apparently recycled from tapes of ""The Laurel & Hardy Show"" of the late 1980s. ""Sons of the Desert"" has a curious fadeout/fadein after the ""Honolulu Baby"" musical number and a prominent digital tape glitch toward the end. ""Another Fine Mess"" has lite scratches throughout and an ""RHI"" logo on the beginning -- a sure giveaway to the TV origins of this material. With so much better material available on these films from Germany, why, oh why are we getting the inferior old versions here, in the country where the films were made?"
5,Perfect!,"Ever since I bought a DVD player way back when, I've been waiting for something like this to come along.The films are restored very well and look great on DVD. The sound restoration is also very good. This disc is right on par with the Three Stooges discs being released from Columbia/Tristar.Let's hope there are more discs like this on the way."
2,"A book that students will dread, yet professors will love!!!","I had to read this book for my college history course in World History. The book gave good factual events from an American who had gone to Russia during the five year plan in Stalin's regime. This book is an autobiographical account of an American man's life and marriage in Russia, yet I did not enjoy the deep amount of factual literature that was implemented into the book, since the author did not let the reader become intimate with his personal life or feelings. I felt that this book was more of a textbook than a novel. However, I believe that professors will most likely assign this book for their students, especially for the topic of the five year plan, due to the amount of historical and factual content embedded into the story."
5,Easy and fun to fly kite,"I bought this kite for our beach vacation. It packs small, has no breakable parts and was very easy to fly,but it does need a medium to strong wind to stay up.Although my two year old twins lost interest after 20 minutes I had fun and would by it again,"
4,Lies and Secrets,"This was the first 7th Heaven book I read so I was just exploring. I can tell you that all those people who say stories based on TV is ... are wrong! I loved this book and it gave my another 7th heaven rertue to think about. Lucy get's tangled between what's yruley right and got she truley wants, will she chose to be faithful toward her pnly friend at camp or will she get caught up in a stir of love? I highly recomend this! It will keep you going back for more.I am also reading the Sister's Through the Seasons and I'm just on the first book in that ""Ruthy goes to Hollywoood"" I suggest this after you read Camp Camden"
3,"Classic Beat-Em-Up Action, Yet Very Repetitive","I really wish this game had trophy support, but that doesn't stop it from being an entertaining game with a lot to offer. The classic beat-em-up action is too addictive and will appeal to the likes of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and God of War fans. It doesn't have much replay value once you beat it, but attempting to do the secret missions can be kind of tricky sometimes, as well as the additional difficulty levels. However, throughout the game, you will have to fight the same bosses and backtrack, which really took a majority of the fun out of it. Nevertheless, DMC is a great game if you are into the beat-em-up genre."
2,DMC 4 so sad,"This game was... the graphics were great, but that being said the camera angles were terrible at times, also the main character's weapons were sluggish compaired to Dante's, Blue Rose sucked big time, even with the upgrade and powering the gun up it was just weak. The Buster Move was flashy but little else. And while it was a nice throw back to the old DMC style the bosses were really easy to kill once you memorized their attack pattern which took all of three seconds.I was really disappointed with this game and the characters in it."
3,"Excellent Graphics, lame story","I really expected a little more out of this game after playing the demo, but unfortunately this game is not that great. It does not offer any new gameplay elements that an older generation console could not also do. The story is pretty lame, such as when Nero can not get a control panel to work, so he gets an idea and steps back from it. He shoots it with his gun, the light changes from red to green, and then it works as he expects it to. Stupid!The graphics are very good, especially the in game graphics. Fans of the series may enjoy this game, but new players should play one of the true next gen games like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune instead with a way better written, more compelling story."
2,Good gameplay not much else,I guess I'm getting old (32) but since purchasing the PS3 a year and a half ago I haven't found one awesome game.The cut scenes are boring unless your into japanese anime (ani-ghey). They are excessively long.The actual gameplay is decent it is pretty much like a fighting adventure game. the puzzles are pretty weak and gets repetitive (jump puzzles mostly). there is a lack of content and mostly you just replay all the same levels to unlock stuff.wish i didn't get this one!!! it will be going up for sale very soon.
5,Ages like a good wine,"I bought this book while preparing to write on political changes in Iraq during 2003. It was one of many.At first it seemed somewhat biased in its tone (pro Saddam), when compared to the rest of the bunch but it was well written, with a lot of background research visible. As time passed, most of the reasoning in it got validated, unlike a good portion of the official mumbo jumbo.Made me want to read some more of Dilip Hiro!"
5,Great feel and sound.,"These maracas sound great. They are very light weight and easy to hold both of them in one hand as desired. The sound is bright and bold. They really cut through the sound. You may actually have to watch you don't shake them to hard as they do project. They're alss very well made, so should produce years of enjoyment. I highly recommend these maracas."
4,Great Information,"This book is ""usual"" Carolynn Myss material, however the format was more tedious then any of her other works. I would recommend it to anyone with more time available to read."
5,Powerful!,This is an amazing work. So clear. I've been hearing about Caroline Myss for some time now and this book was recommended to me as a way to begin. It does not disappoint!
4,how to know the autor personally?,The book is very interesting and I'd like to enter in contact with Caroline Myss for myself. (excuse me for my bad english! )
5,Core Course for Spiritual Major,"When we want to get a degree in Engineering, we have to study some theortical courses and some applied courses. This book is one of the basic or core courses in the spiritual field. By reading it thoroughly, you can understand the theme behind a lot of other spiritual books.Prof. Caroline Myss is really a gift from GOD to people who are interested in spirituality.Thank You, Thank You, Thank You to Dr. Caroline Myss for all her valuable books."
5,"Awesome book, a MUST have!","Normally I get 99% of my books from Amazon, but I was at the book store with my husband and I was just drawn to this book. I have never heard of Caroline Myss, but now I am a HUGE fan. I just love this book! Thank you Caroline for writting such an inspirational, eye opening, touching book."
3,Excellent opener. Steadily looses steam after 100 pages.,Thoroughly impressive in the beginning. Helps the reader understand that physical health is directly related to their mental health. Her impressions of how the chakras indicate health problems are fascinating. I really think she is onto something but not quite there.
2,"Terrible, Very Dissapointed","I don't blindly accept or blindly deny what I haven't experienced first hand, but all this new-ageish energy healing stuff is very overblown. When someone says that there is an essential center of the body that is responsible for all disease processes (the fifth chakra), I have to be rational and be a critical thinker about it.Now I have experienced some strange things. And I know that the money isn't there to conduct the proper studies on alternative healing. But they don't have to keep on making unfounded claims, and deny modern medicine/psychology.I found Eastern Body, Western Mind to be a much superior reinterpretation of the eastern body centers. Although more about psychological/spiritual healing and not so much energy healing."
5,This is a revolutionary book full of rare wisdom.,I have found this book to be one of the few that has had a profound impact on my life. Each page related to my situation and brought me great insight. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in developing and nurturing their spirit. I have deep respect for Caroline Myss.
2,"Movie is good, music is terrible!","My 3 year old loves tractors, so he could watch this DVD all day. There is no way I could though! The music does not go with the movie at all. And I hate to say it, but if you were just listening, and not watching, you would think it was an adult film. Yeah, I know! The trucks are great, I just wish it had ""truck"" kind of music to go along with it!"
4,Cute well made set,"This is a cute set, bright colors. Unfortunately I ordered the wrong one, as I had meant to get the transportation themed one, so I sent this one back."
3,Not so exciting...,Although I'm a huge Mike Tyson fan.. this DVD turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It was purely built as a PR tool to get people to *know* the real Mike and Tyson. I would not recommend buying this item since it really doesn't contain anything but very close up interviews... I don't know why the cameraman was so close to the folks being interviewed... in some cases you could even count the hair in their nose.
2,Waste of money,"Waste of money not 320. It sounds muffled in a system, buyers beware.I do not recommend. Should have to advertise bit rate."
4,Dang good Ginger!,"This is Ginger's finest role...she is perfect as the young women torn between two men...if you're looking for a suspensful movie, this one will keep you on the edge until the last second."
1,Very prejudiced.,"This book was written by scholars who attempt to slam minority religions. I did not find this helpful as at the time I read this I was looking for the truth. It seems that they are taking facts and craftily twisting them to support the arguments presented. They want you to think that anyone who is a Mormon,Jehovah's witness,etc is being decieved and is gullable.One thing that people fail to realize is that there are many members within these religions as in almost any that have benefited because of their religion's teachings and are happy people. I don't think any of the religions mentioned in this book are ""cults"". The writers should have saved all that research for something worthwhile."
1,Vile.,"I write this review as a Christian who came to the faith as an adult.I grew up in a faith other than Christianity and had an older sibling who converted to a fundamentalist branch of Christianity when I was a teen. This book was thrust in my face as 'evidence' of the religion I was raised with being askew.I then spent 18 years of my life hating Christianity and having utter disdain for the people who practiced it. Not until did I encounter a group of critically thinking, wise and educated Christians did I re-open my mind to the faith and receive Christ.Bottom line - this is a hateful book that does not take into account the history and tradition of the worlds' religions. If they're not Christian, they're a 'cult'. Purchasing this book is a waste of time and money - and if you're considering the buy to help evangelize to people whose faith is one of the 'cults' - think again. You'll just make them even more angry at Christianity.Try being a good neighbor instead and reading some C.S. Lewis."
1,If I Could Give Less Stars...I Certainly Would!,"This was a lame rip-off movie - an American Gangsta version of the Italian Job or others. The characters were not believable. How do they expect us to believe this cultural diversity dream world where black and white gangstas are hip, civil & hang out like an Ocean's 11 team. These gangstas wear suits for the helluvit just cuz they got such a keen sense of style. Uh huh. Insulting."
5,Wonderfully created,There is so much suspense in this movie. I stayed on the edge of my seat while watching this film.
4,"Great delivery, Great movie","I bought this for my boyfriend, as he had been wanting it for a while. I got what i wanted, and at a fair price too. it was an interesting movie, makes me wish i had all the skills they did haha"
4,Actor Packed,A lot of big names. The movie was not what it should have been. Although action packed with a good story line. The number of good actors should have brought a lot more to the movie!
1,Great if you've never seen a crime movie in your life.,"Seriously, this movie had every cliche in the book. An amalgam of every crime movie I've ever seen, this film offers nothing new or entertaining. the dialog is unnatural and the progression of the movie is predictable. worst of all there wasn't a single character I really cared to relate to."
3,"Well, just o.k.","It did have a lot of action, that is a plus. The actors did a good job with what they had. The movie just seemed like it was a have and have not based movie. Maybe that's what they were going for. ""Here is what you can have if you break the law"". I don't know, it's just a movie, was a good escape for a Saturday afternoon."
2,"A group of thieves get together for one last heist. Same old plot, same old outcome. Action was good, just not enough. I say C","After thier old partner is released from jail he comes up with one last heist. Officer Jack Welles (Dillon) will stop at nothing to stop them. This movie is nothing new. A group of robbers team up one last time for one last giant heist. Much like the movie ""Armored"" there is a lot of planning and preparation and not much of the actual crime. The opening scene is very original and sets a good tone for the movie. Then there is about an hour of ""how are we going to do it"", but the last twenty minutes are exciting again. The action scenes in this movie are very exciting and fun to watch, there just aren't enough of them. The actual plot and acting are not enough to keep the movie going in between the action. If you liked the movie ""Armored"" you will definatly enjoy this movie. I was not impressed with either. I give it a C."
2,awfull camera work,"Here is one movie destroyed by camera work.When will these idiots realize that to change camera every 2 seconds and prevent the audience to follow the actions is not really fun to watch.This movie could have been a great one ,but this camera work is so annoying. How can you enjoy a chase if you can't even follow it.There is so many people are complaining about this but Hollywood keep using the same stupid editing.I will stop watching action movies until they film them properly.They ruined this one too."
4,M&M work those subs,"This is the forth album and it hits hard. This is great CD to use at a sound competition for those people who still respect the high end audio. This is also Vicious Base second album, not a lot rappin' but a lot of bass droppin!"
3,A little disappointing,"Don't get me wrong: this DVD contains some excellent blues footage. Nonetheless I am disappointed because I expected a DVD fully dedicated to Muddy Waters, while Muddy features only four songs. Moreover, at least three of them (Hoochie coochie man, Mannish boy and Got my mojo working) have already been seen and heard (albeit in different versions) many other times.It it was for Muddy's tracks, this DVD would yield 2 stars (for the bad track list, not for the quality of the performance, which is high). The first four tracks (two led by Jr Wells and two by Buddy Guy) are top quality blues tracks, and they contributed to raise the rating.(SONG LIST: Messin' with the kid, Hoodoo man blues, When you see the tears from my eyes, Ten years ago, Hoochie coochie man, Mannish boy, The same thing, Got my mojo working)."
2,Not as good as I hoped.,"I really thought this version would be good. I love Alice-related stories and even did my thesis on the novel. However, I was severly dissapointed with this movie. From the cinemetography to the characters, it was a mess. The story, while sort-of ont he right path, was messy and hard to follow. Also, the characters were a little hard to relate to those of the orginal work. I woudl save your money and RedBox this movie. It's worth the dolalr to watch, but not to own."
4,"excellent dvd, but is not perfect","if you're a laker fan or a basketball fan, this dvd is worth buying, and it is not too highly priced, but it is flawed.1. why is kobe bryant not pictured anywhere, yet rick fox and derek fisher are? i love fish and fox, but it seems odd that kobe wouldn't be pictured.2. where is chick hearn? they should have included a history of chick and a game that he announced (along with stu lantz...chick 'n' stu)3. i'm glad to get the game, but i know they could have found the whole games (ask laker fans, i know some who have them, including myself).4. a complete list of everyone who has ever been a laker and when they were a laker would have been nice.5. where is game 7 of the 2000 western conference finals vs. portland?ok, i'm done. if i could give this dvd 41/2 stars, i would have. even with the flaws i mentioned, it's still a great dvd. i'm very happy with it. it's nice to watch the 1972 game and see pat riley and phil jackson playing (among countless others)."
3,Some of it didn't work,"I'd have paid no more than 15 dollars for this set if I'd have known that most of the 1972 game would malfunction and ultimately cut out; my player would say ""cannot read disc."" Good otherwise...not the first Dynasty set I've had trouble with...Also had trouble with the Sixers dvd set."
1,WTH!!!,"Recieved the package in a good enough time but the issue was that disc 3 was missing & in it's place was Agent Cody Banks 3, which leads me to believe that it was done intentionally. Emailed the seller twice in hopes to just get the third disc sent out sent my hubby had no issue w/the other discs but seller never responded. Forced to file a claim to get my money back. Highly dissapointed w/the service & dissapointed hubby who of course really wants to watch disc 3 it was the most important disc to him & he doesn't have it. Buyer be ware I will never buy from this seller again."
2,one of the dvd got scratched,"The content of this set is excellent.the price is excellent.But the dvd holder was defective and one of the dvd got loose and was scratched. Bad enough that I have to ff the scratched part in order to watch the end of 87 championship game.I would have returned it, but the packaging method is defective and I am not sure if the new dvd set might have a dvd scratched or not.the 1980 championship was the most important one, so I didn't want to risk it."
3,Needs a competent editor,"This is an interesting and provocative book, well worth reading; see the other reviews for that. Unfortunately, it makes very clumsy reading. I think this was not Citino's fault. This seems, in fact, to be the worst edited book I've ever read. The main problem is not typos but repitition: Citino will often say virtually the same thing in virtually the same way within paragraphs. (See for example the comments on the US M3 tank on pp. 58-59.) This is the kind of understandable mistake a writer makes in the course of writing a book, and it is why publishers hire editors and pay them (albeit not very well). This book was published by University Press of Kansas. They need to have a stern talk with whoever edited Citino's book; they have done him an injustice."
5,Pure gold hack-n-slash style on a disc,"First of all I must say that this review may seem a bit biased as I absolutely love the DMC game series. It's quite possibly one of the best games of it's genre. The game looks simply amazing, the voice acting is superb, it's fun to play, and it's very easy to pick up for those new to the DMC series. It's got everything, a captivating storyline, amazing cut scenes, intense boss fights and more. Has a high replay value. It's one of the few single player games I have that I've actually put back in the xbox after beating it more than once. If there were anything I would change about it, it would be the awkward camera angles (not too many but at times you will notice what I'm talking about). Very highly recommend this title! Good luck."
3,The story is slow,The game is very slow and did not pull me into the story so I only played it about 45 minutes. It is still sitting on the shelf. Maybe I will get to it and give it a chance one day.
5,Great title,"Actually I don't remember buying this game =S But i'v definitely played it and I'd recommend it always. Is a great action game that requires fast hands and good thinking, the history is also memorable and I can't wait until the next one.5 of 5"
5,Field-tested camera bag,We bought three of these cases for our Archaeology department's 35mm cameras.Our field crews are out in the field with lots of dust and other equipment. This camera case is light and fits the cameras with the longer 90-mm lens perfectly. It's well padded and keeps the dust out. It also has a convenient pocket to store addition batteries and film. The construction is sturdy with easy to use rubbery zipper pulls. The bag may be too big for people using a standard lens. Could also be great for full size digital cameras (that look like the old 35-mm).
2,11 MERV Filter,"Too thick, stick with 8 MERV or lower. Air flow was inhibited, and the variable blower motor labored to maintain proper air flow. Went to an 8 MERV OEM with much better success."
3,Great Support.......,"Does it work? No.But the reason why is what bugs me. I connected wirelessly with my router, no problem. The print server even reocognized that it was connected to an Epson printer. But in the end, it turns out that my Epson 925 is NOT compatible, something to do with the ""spooling"". I'm going to try Epson's tech support. Linksys' support was very good. It seems that configuring printservers is a bit more on the technical side than other wireless setups."
3,"Fancy and pretty, but not practical","I like the pictures in this book and the details in the appendix, but the ingredients are either hard to find or expensive and the recipes are so complex. If I was to spend that much time making anything, I would want it to be a 5 course meal. I have had this book over a year and have never made a thing from it."
4,Wonderful dance CD! Good descriptive helps with it.,"We really enjoyed learning the steps with the narration & music, then practicing until we could do the dance with the instrument only music. This is great for focus, listening skills, agility, working together, spacial awareness.If you have a basic background in dance, this will be fairly easy. I would imagine, however, if you do NOT have a background in dance that it would be more difficult to understand what the movements are... but that being said, you could use the description to create your own movements. You really can't go wrong making folk dancing fun!"
5,You have to check it out!,Really good children's story! Very creative and a lot of info. in book! It's Great!
5,Joyful and Uplifting,"This CD is just beautiful and is especially meaningful if you have watched the DVD on the Singing Revolution that took place in Estonia or if you have been to the concert site. The choir is amazing, the choice of songs wonderful. I highly recommend it. It is too bad more copies are not available."
4,"Looks nice, but that's about it.","Nice looking case for CF cards. But it broke - the little plastic thing that you have to push to open the case just fell off after few weeks (may be a month) of use (and I didn't open it every day). I can still open it and still using it. Other than this weird button that don't want to remain on its place, everything else this case is supposed to do it does perfectly."
5,Jacob's Faith,"Wonderful writing, makes you feel part of the story! I completely enjoyed reading this book, and would think everyone would! I love the Lora Leigh Breed stories, I think most people who enjoy paranormal book would like these too. They are NOT shifters, but genetic creation. Very interesting series!"
4,Jacob's Faith,"This book was really good. I love the character of Faith. She was stood up for herself and didn't let anyone push her around. She was strong. Yes, she loved her guy and put up with a lot of his macho bull, and even eventually settled down with him. But, she gave him his money's worth in stubbornness and determination."
3,More plot--a little less sex!,"Can't actually believe I'm writing this--usually I'm saying where is the romance--how about another love scene--but it isn't so much that there was too much sex--as there was not enough plot...The actually plot itself could have been written in 3 or less chapters--all the rest is Jacob and Faith screwing--and I mean screwing their brains out......I do like the epilog at the end, it really got me ready for Aidan's Charity...."
2,"Taylor Timer/Clock ""Half"" works","The Taylor Two-Event Digital Timer/Clock arrived with only the lower digits working. Considering the low price and effort required to return the item, we decided to keep it. We now have a Taylor One-Event Digital Timer/Clock.Harry Chadwick"
5,A must for even the most expert traveler,"Even for the most expert traveler, the Naked Airport will shed light on many facets of airports domestically and abroad. For instance, did you know that there are over 200 old bank safes in the landfill at Newark (EWR)? The history is layed out cronologically, but woven with social, political, economic and business history, such that it is any interesting narrative rather than a dry recitation of facts."
3,"Great history, but loses steam at the end","This is a fascinating book, full of great stories about the origin of the modern airport. With the history of the airport comes the history of our culture, which makes for exciting reading. The archival details are astounding. The pacing is just right.However, the book falls far short after it reaches the 1970s. True, there was very little airport construction during the 80s and 90s, but I still got the sense that Gordon tired of the material and just wanted to wrap up the book.Also, a comment on post-9/11 airport history is relegated to a tacked-on page or two at the end of the book."
5,Awesome,"While I havent read the book personally, I do know the man who wrote it and let me tell you, he's a big deal. I mean really big deal. I highly recommend this book and knowing that it is 11.4 ounces really lets the reader know that it's not too heavy of a read nor not too light. Pretty much right in between. Perfect? Time will tell.... I still need to read it."
4,I got this book on the advice of a conservative discussion group member,"I got this book on the recommendation of someone in the Eons, Conservative Action Group. I have not finished it yet."
1,The sizing is off,I can't wear these socks even though they are 100% cotton. I understand it's more difficult to create elasticity but they slip off because it's one size between size 6 and 7.5. I'm size 7 and it feels like I'm putting a size 11 on.
3,Order confusion - size,"The socks feel soft and comfy, however, they were way too large. I don't feel that the sizes listed were clear. How to know what size to buy. I used the chart, however, way too big. Gave them to my husband."
1,Poor quality,"One of the socks I ordered had a hole in them. Also, the size of the socks seemed really big for the size I ordered."
3,good for sleeping,These socks are way too big for my size 7 foot and fit relatively poorly. I would never wear them with shoes. But they work great for sleeping since they are so thin. My feet don't overheat.Alternate use: I even wear them over my hands at night with hand lotion since they cover my wrist and most gloves do not.
3,"A Bland ""Same ol' Same ol' "" account...","This is the least impressive of a good half-dozen soldier memoir types I've read...Structurally,it is a relatively small book (barely 200pgs) with large print - I'd argue one could read it in a 90 minute sitting...I found Mr Benson's account of a most rambling nature - not much chronological flow, with few incidents of ""landmark"" battles to let the reader have a true pulse of the action or events. If you've read a few of these soldier accounts, you will quickly notice the ho-hum pattern of text that detail ""terrible musketry"" and ""cooking three days rations"" and "" ___ was shot right next to me"". Granted, the prison escapades have some merit.I'd suggest Carlton McCarthy's DETAILED MINUTIAE OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE and John Billings' HARDTACK AND COFFEE. Both offer a more significant look at Confederate and Union tedium, respectively."
2,Beware ... Wicked Witch Pictures and References,"Each Peach Pear Plum could have been a lovely book (cute rhymes, I Spy format, nice artwork). BUT, there are pictures and references to a wicked witch throughout. That ruined it for us. I regret that I purchased the book."
3,Good,"This is a good greates hits package, if they had enough hit to make one. They only had 3 top 40 songs. They are ""What's On Your Mind(Pure Energy)"" hit 3, ""Walking Away"" hit 9, and the horrible ""Think"" hit 28. This album is really not worth it. You should really just buy the original Information Society album."
4,WoW,I am in disbelief that this could continue thru this childs whole life and no-one would liston to her. Amazing story of true surival. Worderfully written.
3,Potential for Much More,"Not much is known about MBP, and I purchased this first hand account with expectation of gaining insight. Julie does a great job of painting the picture of life in a family where this illness exists, even going as far as to include her own medical records. It would have been beneficial to read more about her life as and adult in recovery. The conclusion was quite loose and disconnected, explaining the introduction of new children and Julie's concern for them while failing to close the questions of her own ultimate medical condition, how she learned to cope with the trauma of her past, and even how she eventually started her own family (if she did). As a psychotherapist, perhaps my expectations were too high. This book fell short of my expectations, though."
4,Super Sad,This book was horribly amazing. I loved and hated it like all great books should make you do. Julie Gregory has this terrible story of her childhood and has somehow molded something so breathtaking out of it. Her journey through life is incredible and she has somehow managed to make it in spite of her deranged mother. This story is inspiring and definitely worth the read.
2,Mediocre,"I was intrigued to read about Munchhausen's By Proxy, but this book disappointments. It starts off really good, but there was no closure, it never addresses if the perpetrator was convicted. Skip this book, unless you get it for free, and even then you'll probably be bored half way in."
2,Not much story here,"I was hoping for a better-written, more insightful story. It was okay, but not a keeper."
3,Parts of this text sickened me with boredom!,"Although I sympathize with Julie Gregory for the unmerciful childhood she was forced to endure, I found her book to be disconnected and boring. Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is a cruel disease which epitomizes the extent of child abuse that can be inflicted upon a child without intervention by social agencies. It seems impossible to believe that a caregiver, most especially a mother, can intentionally cause such pain and agony.I would have liked to see Julie Gregory press charges against her mohter, bring her to trial, have a jury convict her, and see her being hauled off to jail (for life). Sandy Gregory is a ""sick ticket"" and needs to be haulted in her ongoing rampage of continuing abuse."
5,"Okay, now what??","The book held me riveted. I sure do hope Julie Gregory has another book in her. I want to know what happened next! I'm sort of an old-fashioned sort, wanting to see the bad guys get theirs! And make no mistake, such an insidious abuse of a child makes old mom a Big-Time Bad Guy. The other Bad Guys are TNTC- that's a medical abbreviation for too numerous to count!"
3,horis ds lite stand saves the hand and shoulders.,this product is really helpful to me because it can give my hands andshoulder a break without skipping a beat.
2,Nice But Does Not Fit,Amazons website says this fits the 2010 Tucson but it DOES NOT! This deflector only fits up to the 2009 Tucson. AVS will not have one available for the 2010 until sometime this fall according to their customer support.
1,Good lord! People can publish anything!,"Robert thinks that just because he reads something, he can spit it back out. This book by an ""expert"" is putrid; the care described would be considered abuse by most varanid enthusiasts. Not to mention there are many mislabeled photos etc.I am shocked this got published. It really shows how ignorant the general public is about reptiles... they seem to just accept the information because it is published by a PhD.Reading this, and considering it good is like reading a children's book about a construction company, and trying to builda house with it. Completely wacky info, everything mislabeled, a recipe for disaster. Get Daniel's fantastic Savannah Monitor book instead!"
5,Useful for anyone interesting in research techniques that values the issues and perspectives of practitioners,"Excellent overview of the theory and practice of action research. This short book presents the tools and philosophy in a credible and practical way. It's useful for anyone interesting in research techniques that values the issues and perspectives of practitioners, especially classroom teachers."
4,Good reference. Not entirely version specific.,"This is a good reference book. Because SQL has so many flavors, there are nuances that exist which force writers to reference them in a almost any book on the subject. Narrowing in on your paticular version is very helpful. Perhaps these would be better written for a specific audience if they were Manufacturer and Version specific and without the crosswalks.Wouldn't you sell more books if it were version specific?"
5,Lo Maximo,"oh my goodness.... Los Panchos son de lo mejor, si pudiera regresar al pasado seria en la epoca de los Panchos y los mas grandes artistas q existian en aquel tiempo ""son lo maximo"""
3,Organ Fireworks X,Organ Fireworks X is a 2004 Hyperion Records Limited featuring Christopher Herrick and Jeremy Spurgeon. Ref Clark has written the music notes. Also included are short biographies of the organists. I like organ music but this is a little to modern for my taste. Alright but nothing more. 3-/5.
3,it works well,"I have never used a steamer with a hose before. I purchased new drapes and they were very creased from being in the package. The cost to have them steamed and then get then home without creasing scared me off. So I decided to get a steamer. The canister holds enough water to steam 4 panels, liners too. It worked great. I am not sure about the attachments. I tried a shirt and I will probably still dry clean or iron the shirts because I cannot figuire out how to do the sleeves and sides. But the trousers were easy and came out great. My only complaint was that it seems to sputter water and its hot and if the hand you hold the fabric with is above the nozzle the steam rises and you can be burned. But I love it and will be more careful. I am sure with practise I might even be able to do shirts."
3,Not bad...but not what I expected,If you are looking for something just to turn on real quick and it gets all the wrinkles out of your shirt then you'll be disappointed. It takes a while to warm up and it takes about as much time as getting out your ironing board and iron and ironing out the wrinkles as it does to go over and over your shirt with the hose. It does get them out...it's just a little more time consuming than I'd like. I wanted something to just whip out and get the wrinkles out...like a quick steaming and it doesn't do that.
1,"piece of crap! please, dont even consider buying it!","I had seen the reviews some months ago, so i did not had high hopes for this thing.....however, i never thought it was going to be sooooo crappy!I literally cant find anything positive to say, other than the price.All the steamer did was wet my shirts!!! that is, I ended up with a shirt as wrinkled as before, but all wet because the machine coughs water as it 'steams.' I know is not as crisp as if u iron, but still, i was expecting at least some improvement...To make the story short, it went straight to the box, to be returned tomorrow. Pleeeease dont waste your money!"
2,Can't control steam,It takes too long to produce steam and you can't control the steam. When you are done you don't know what to do with the handle and the hose. They are quite bulky to store in anywhere. I wish I bought something else instead. It is so not worth the money.
1,"Terrible - spits water, burns hands","This steamer is awful about spitting water all over your clean clothes, burning your hands, and it does a terrible job of removing wrinkles. The rubber tubing is flimsy and gets so hot that if you accidentally touch it you will get burned. Don't bother with this model!"
2,Slow work,"I have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use."
1,Conair GS4 Compact Fabric Steamer Review,I bought this product about a year ago. It only worked for 2 weeks. After that it started dripping and took forever to produce steam. If you are looking for a quality steamer stay away from these cheap ones.
1,Don't bother,Steam is weak and you must hold it up high or it'll drip all over the item being steamed.Item being returned as I type this.
4,excellent steamer but hard to store,"I've been using this steamer regularly and it works beautifully. Shirts, pants, curtains all lose their wrinkles. Straightening the hose when I hear the bubbling noise has become a habit. My only complaint is storage. It's a bit bulky to put in the laundry cupboard. I leave the steamer set up on the floor next to the kitchen/laundry room door. Not ideal but then that eliminates set up time when I use it."
3,Steamer Flaws,"Bought this for my husband so he could use it on his uniform shirts. He loves it, however, his only complaint is that it takes 20 minutes to heat up. He feels he could iron his shirts faster.Conair GS4 Compact Fabric Steamer"
5,Haven't used an iron in 3 years!,"It may not be the best one on the market and I have overheated my thumb a time or two while using it. However, it does its job quite well, is very easy to use and you cannot beat the price in comparison to the more expensive ones. I love this steamer, I recommend it to all of my friends and use it nearly every day."
3,The Complete Pekingese,"I was needing a book about the behaviors, training tips, and how to care for my dog. This book is about the breed, where it all started, and the breeding lines. It would be good for someone wanting to show or breed their Pekingese."
3,vista from xp,The new Vista is all pretty and really has some cool features. BUT if you have a computer that is more than 6 mo. old (mine is less than a year) like my HP you can forget about using the Aero features. The graphic drivers that are suppose to update with installation does not update these computers. There are no updated drivers available from Intel because they in their infinite wisdom abandoned all their laptops that are more than 6 months. They have no intention of providing these updates in the future. Write them or call them and complain. If your laptop is like mine that HAS ENOUGH MEMORY to run Aeros but cannot because of the driver then call or write Intel to thank them for abandoning their users. There is no way to replace the driver in your laptops because it is built into the motherboard. The only option that you have is buy a new computer. BUYing a new computer is out of the question for most people when they have just purchased one this past year!!Not a happy camper!
5,Deceptively beautiful and powerful,"Gretel Ehrlich's wonderful book has been a nightly treat, savored at the fireside. Since the lives of the Greenland Inuit are so remote from daily experience, it takes quite a bit of adjustment to enter into their perspective. Ehrlich accomplishes this through an obsessive, recurring immersion, reminiscent of her hero Knud Rassmussen. She went back to Greenland seven times, for goodness sakes! The focus she achieves through these revisitings, and our chance to re-encounter characters and experiences, builds a powerful emotional bond. I felt a real loss when I had to say goodbye to these characters for the final time. This is a deceptively beautiful, powerful book."
2,Diary-summary book that is hardly exciting...,"I wish this book were better! I really love Greenland - an amazing land! I was looking forward to this book, with strong excitement.Yet, I was severely disappointed. It's a slow-paced, tedious book riddled with useless and pointless details. While certain topics are interesting, the writing style is plain and hardly captivating.Disappointment..."
5,Very Pleased,"I have found this machine to be of great use. I do a great deal of sewing and this steamer has been wonderful. Granted it is mostly plastic parts, I have yet to find that to be a problem. The steam is ready in a matter of seconds, and with a full tank, you can steam for at least 45 min.Care does need to be taken, because steam is hot and it will burn, but that is the nature any steam machine you purchase.Good little machine for the money."
3,Works Good - Uses a LOT of water,"It actually works really well on lighter fabrics, but it uses a lot of water. If you have a big job to do, be prepared to refill a number of times. Otherwise it works well for daily use. I tried to steam heavier curtains and had to go over them multiple times to get out the wrinkles...but still did a decent job...but probably would have taken a shorter amount of time to take them down and iron them."
4,Does the job,Value for money package. Wish the hose was longer than what it is in this product. Comes with a few attachments to be used with the hose. Great buy overall.
2,Not a fan : (,"I'm a little bummed! This bra looks so extremely comfortable in the picture that I had to have it. I will keep it but wont use it as much as the others that I have. The band underneath the bust folds under (minor). The cups are the only soft part about the bra because its silk but all the lining, such as the straps and back band, itch. One plus is that it has lots of extra ""clips"" in the back to extend the width around. The cups are not tight to my bust like a sports bra instead they pucker a little and I wouldn't have gone smaller on the size because it's already plenty tight enough. This bra is just okay for me : /"
2,Comfortable but THIN,"This nursing bra is very comfortable. If you are producing milk, you will need to wear pads underneath. I loved the comfort of this bra so I when on a shopping spree to find nursing pads that were smooth enough to not show through the bra and therefore, show through my tops. The best option I could find were Lilly pass but heaven forbid they leak because the bra is so sheer it will show it all. I also tried disposable, cotton, and bamboobies but all looked pretty bad.This bra could be easily worn if you wear nursing pads and then a baggy top... I use mine to sleep in because my husband doesn't care if I have lumpy breasts and I don't mind either.I do not recommend this bra."
2,Get the Bravado instead,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but just have to say it: It DOES itch in the back. I'm keeping it as a backup; the rest of the bra is comfortable enough. If you are sensitive with textures or fabrics, skip it, though. I bought the Bravado seamless nursing bra and it is super comfortable and itch free."
5,Best Nursing Bra Ever!!!,This is the best nursing bra I have ever used (more than 10 years of experience there). It is light yet supportive without underwire---no small feat for a 36DD size. The interior support covers and hold the entire breast even as the flap is opended to feed the baby. It washes very well on delicate in a washing machine. The plethora of snap closures on the back strap allow it to fit around the chest perfectly even as a woman's size changes almost daily post-pregnancy. It stays smooth and lays nicely even under tighter shirts. Without a padded cup it even manages to hide unsightly nipples except immeadiately after nursing.
4,"noticeable effect, great value","After researching ZMA (Zinc/Magnesium Aspartate) and finding mostly positive reviews, I decided to purchase this, as the citrate form seems to be a bit cheaper and just as bio-available. I find the pills to be without taste or smell, and quite easy to swallow. They aren't too large, and get kind of slippery once in your mouth. The directions say to take two, preferably with meals, witch contradicts most other magnesium supplement usage labels which state to take on an empty stomach, and not to co-ingest with calcium. So I take one or two in the morning with some juice or water, about 15 minutes before eating breakfast. I've noticed a definite improvement in sleep quality--less waking throughout the night, and more dreams. No negative side effects, other than slight upset stomach if I take two and don't consume enough liquid. Love the glass bottle."
5,Solgar product review,Good product. Im taking it with B2 and butterbur for my headaches.Glad i made the purchase. would purchase this item again in future.
3,Super Reader,"A kid's story, to start with.A couple of boys, both with alliterative names starting with D, are off to visit the jungle. The only problem is when they get there, they get a bit sidetracked, and lost, and the Lord of the Jungle doesn't know quite where they are.They end up running into a lion, and cannibals, as you do, when lost in Tarzan's Africa. They manage to find a couple of decent local blokes though, and eventually Tarzan tracks them down."
4,Excellent basic deck,"I've used this deck for years, and was surprised to read the other review panning it. It's an excellent unit, very easy to use, and very durable. I've recorded hundreds of hours on mine, and the resulting tapes sound clean, loud, and well-balanced. It plays back well, and doesn't try to do too much - auto-flip or double-sided tape decks have always given me maintenance problems. This deck works great."
1,Very poor product,"This is by far the worst dual cassette deck that I have ever purchased. The play back and record have very poor sound quality. The tapes regardless of what kind, do not play at the right speed, in other words they play slower then other tape decks.Very unhappy."
2,On rails train wreck,"After enjoying RE4 so much, this one was a disappointment. The on rails feature does all your walking around and room scanning for you. I constantly found myself fighting it to slow down or get a second look at something, but you can't. The ability to rouse enemies, then backtrack and set up and ambush isn't there, and you can't go back for extra items once you have passed an area. In short, you feel confined and robbed of your ability to set up a game strategy. What good is a rich environment if you can't explore it? It's just boring shooting over and over. I played the first few levels, but will ignore or sell back the game from now on."
1,What a Disappointment!,"After playing Resident Evil 4 on our WII system, and thoroughly enjoying it, we were excited to experience Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles. It may be that we just don't enjoy ""rail shooter"" games, but both my husband and I really disliked the game. So much so that we went out and bought a PlayStation 3 System. There just aren't enough good games available for WII."
2,Just another rail shooter with poor controls,"I've played this with and without the wii zapper and was disappointed. It plays like House of the Dead or any other rail shooter, but with really crappy accuracy and poor responsiveness to controls.Head shots just don't seem to work. The aiming reticule doesn't line up with the way the zapper feels like it should. You basically have to aim lower than it feels like you should. Squeezing the zapper trigger in a rapid fire fashion does not work. The trigger only trips every second or third time when you squeeze it quickly. Even if you use the wiimote without the zapper, shots just don't seem to connect.The voice acting is a crime against humanity. The only redeeming value of this game is the graphics. That's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one.Bottom line, if you really want a good zombie shooter, just wait for Left for Dead on the 360 and you might be happy. But RE Umbrella Chronicles just isn't worth the $50 dollar price tag. At all."
2,Umbrella Chronicles,"Don't like the format that this game is set up in, Resident Evil 4 is more my style."
1,Boring.,This game is a waste of money. My son and husband got bored within minutes. Then I played it and it was way too easy (even on the difficult setting) and boring as hell. I wish I could return it. It absolutely sucks. I don't understand why the other reviews are so good?! Do you people even play this game prior to submitting a review?I am just going to end this by saying..... it sucks!!!
2,What a shame...,"This game is sad. It is an arcade shooter not and rpg, action adventure like many other Resident Evil games. This is the kinda game that you can play for 15-30 minutes and then get sick of, or run out of quarters. Albeit the wiimote works well on its own or with the zapper it just... kinda a crappy game. I'm glad i bought it at Gamestop used with 2 guns so and was able to return it all for cash.tl;drBuy it at gamestop used and then return it."
3,It was okay...,"Not the best game. Was fun to play with friends, solo was kind of boring though. If you are a resident evil fan you will get more out of it than I did."
3,Unecessary Evil,THis game had me going crazy when I heard the concept of it. I just bought and played the game and my hopes have been dashed. The game plays like an arcade Area 51 rip-off. You basically just look around and shoot at the enemies the computer lets you engage. If you don't have a zapper gun be prepared to lose signal every 20 seconds. If you use the nunchuk make sure you are fully charged and swap battery packs after ten minutes. The sensor bar chooses to ignore the buttons at random and the game really is not that exciting to make you want to play it. THey really missed the mark with this title and I wish it could have been a third person title like every other R.E. and allowed for use of the Wii or GCN controller instead of a zapper or inconsistant nunchuk configuration.
3,its an okay game for a wii,"I think the game is decent. I mean, I'm used to the Call of Duty games on PS3, so any Wii game won't compare to that. But it is about what I expected. Its kind of fun for a little while."
4,Is a fun game,"Game is a fun first person shooter game. My only complaint is you don't have much control over your view. You can look around a bit with the nunchuck, but there's not a lot of movement in any direction. This would be nice as the computer moves you and sometimes moves you too fast so I miss objects and would like to be able to still pick them up. Other than that it is a fun game and works well with the gun."
3,Not really a romance read,If you are looking for a romance read this is not the book for you. Yes the hero and heroine end up together and happy but it is not really the forefront of the story. At time I found this book dragging a little as well. It is a decent adventure book. The development and some of the things that went on in this book I found lacking. It also didn't really seem to have a lot of chemistry going on. I would not buy this book again. It is not a book I can see myself reading again.
3,Prophet W&W,"I found they were not true to size, runs on the large side. Not as comfortable as I thought, but not enough to return them."
3,Good game.But it gets boring.,Warriors of might and magic is a fairly good game with lots of diferent weapons and equipment to chose from. It's your average fantasy adventure game with hackn slash and lots of monsters that rarely change. but theres magic and some special moves to perk the fighting part of the game up.But overall the game is repetitive. Rent this one. Don't buy it.
1,Several glitches,"I bought this game, and at first I thought it was all right. ""Kinda interesting,"" I told myself- I'm always up for an adventure game. However, there were a bunch of glitches, and eventually I got to the point where, even though I had finished the level, defeated all of the monsters, and gotten all of the keys, I COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR WHICH WOULD GET ME OUT OF THE LEVEL. Really frustrating. I was almost finished with the game, and I couldn't progress. I looked online, and a bunch of other people had the same problem. The people at 3DO, although I've loved some of their other games, must have been asleep at the wheel, on this one. Don't buy it."
1,Warriors Of Might And Magic 2,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! FATAL GLITCH CLOSE TO LAST LEVEL!!!Near the end of the game you have to open a door with an Iron Key, and it does not open! This means you cannot continue EVER! THE END! I guarantee I will never buy another game from the scum who produced it. Wasted many hours playing for nothing. It's less than worthless!"
1,terrible,"it is not what I expected. It is a terrible folder. There really is not much room for your music,and expected something in the inside to actually hold the music. Also the cost of shiiping exceeded the cost of the folder by much."
2,Folder too cincy for concert,"Seems capable of holding a single piece of music. Not for choral singers, who often have a dozen octavos to juggle! So far from useful that I immediately bought another manufacturer's product."
1,Disappointing,"Hello. This is the worst book I have ever read on psychotherapy/self-help, by far. (This makes the book very difficult to review/comment on, without being dispersed, since the number of flaws is important. After the first-hundred pages, one only founds eloquent names to daily, simple experiences; and only at about two-hundred pages, one arrives to the central technique that will solve all your problems: To breath deeply. This is, mainly, the so-called ""body-centered approach"", which is only reflected in a few small boxes within the text. I would have given no stars if possible.)"
2,Not Recommended,"Go with the Canon DR-2080. This is one of those scanners, although attractively priced on Amazon.com, is still TOO [spendy] for its size (HUGE footprint).The Scan drivers are difficult to install and are NOT user friendly.Bottom line: go with the Canon DR-2080. Although the Canon is a path through, its quality and ease of use is FAR superior to this Ricoh behemoth."
2,"From good to bad, a whole range","Good element: Elizabeth and Darcy ""feel"" like they fit Austen's characterizations pretty well. The personalities are lifted directly out of A&E;'s movie adaptation.Medium: The language is very uneven: mixed with very good Austenesque sentences is standard Regency romance fare plus modern terms like ""gloppy"" and a servant in danger of being ""fired"" instead of ""dismissed.""Bad: The ""mystery"" is so simple I had it figured out within a few pages, then found the rest of the book boring while it dragged to a conclusion.Really bad: The element of witchcraft which totally dominates the story. Don't call it ""paranormal"" or ""supernatural"" - it's plain old witchcraft and it is a cheap solution to a ""mystery."" Austen, as a clergyman's daughter, would have recognized it as evil and never have added witchcraft to her stories, and Eliza Bennet would have known to stay far away from it.Conclusion: Give this author a miss. Read the Jane Austen mysteries by Stephanie Barron instead."
2,Let's Get Real,"I agree with Elizabeth on her review of this book and just want to add my disappointment with the supernatural solution to the mysteries in these books. Jane Austen was able (especially in Sense and Sensability) to have someone act totally out of character and still come up with a plausible resolution to the story without going into what amounts to ""black magic"". This author did a tremendous job of creating a story, staying greatly in character, almost staying in the 19th century line of thinking, but to solve all the problems she set up, everything fell under the ""folk magic"" category which conveniently (for the author) eliminated any need to be clever. I prefer a book that gets me into a situation or series of situations that I can imagine no solution for and then is resolved in a fantastic, though believable manner."
2,"A *very* silly plot, but a series with potential","This is the first of the Pride & Prejudice follow-on series from Carrie. Both of the first two books have VERY silly plot lines, even as she writes with grace, a sense of the 19th century, a good feel for the Pride & Prejudice characters, and so on.I recommend you start with book THREE: ""North by Northanger"", and read all future works by Carrie. Read the first two in the series only if you are given them as gifts and don't want to appear ungrateful."
2,a bit out of character for Elizabeth Darcy,"I was disapointed in this book by Ms. Bebris. It is all about the occult. I found Elizabeth Darcy's interest in the occult and ""praeternatural"" abilities to be a bit inconsistant for a Jane Austen character! The use of the supernatural made the book a little more than unbelievable. When I took creative writing in college we were warned not to use the supernatural in plots because it made the story unbelievable. Yet now-a-days it seems almost impossible to pick up a novel that doesn't delve into the occult or astrology. This book is easy to read and easy to guess what will happen. I just came away from reading this book disapointed."
3,The Mysteries of Austen,"The author did a good job capturing the essence of Jane Austen's writing. She then threw in some Gothic elements to tell the story. I thought this was particularly clever since Austen often made reference to the reading of Gothic novels, particularly Ann Radcliffe.A fun and fairly quick read recommended for Austen aficionados who also like mysteries."
3,"Fun, Fluffy Austen-Inspired Mystery","This book is absolutely delightful...if you're insanely into P&P. If not, I wouldn't bother with it probably. It's essentially published fan fiction, but I quite enjoyed it. I think Carrie Bebris does a good job of embracing Jane without trying overly hard to BE Jane. Many Austenites fail at writing follow-ups to her books, in my opinion, by trying to write like Jane would, which ends up making their writing overly flowery and pedantic, as though they kept a thesaurus open next to them as they wrote, using only the biggest words that fit their meaning. The only real example of that in Bebris' work that I noticed was a propensity to use the word 'twas far more than could ever be necessary."
3,OKAY,PERSON FORGOT TO TAKE IT OFF THE WEBSITE--HE DIDN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE SO I NEVER GOT IT BUT HE COMMUNICATED WELL
1,This is NOT an album by Delirious? the Martin Smith's band. Remove it from the artist albums!,"Horrible mistake here by Amazon. This is not an album by ""Delirious?"" -- the band from the U.K. led by Martin Smith! Please investigate and remove this thing from any link to the artist ""Delirious?"" on Amazon."
5,Amazingly good graphics,I was amazed with the graphics of this game. The ease of playing is really good too. I've had a lot of fun with it.
3,the game is white and black,The game is superb but there is no color except white and black. What can I do with this problem and there was no key in the safe box.
3,THIS IS ONLY A CD - BE AWARE!,"I was very disappointed when I got this ""book""! I had seen a paperback copy of an earlier edition in my public library and was very pleased to see a newer edition available. I somehow had it in my mind that this was a book with a supplemental CD-ROM. I was wrong. It is only the CD and I prefer paper to computer for this type of book. If I want to look something up for a lesson and my kids are on the computer I can't look it up.This is a good source for information but I do believe that some of the authors views are too religious and dated. Take the book for what it is - the author is on a mission to sell homeschooling AND religion."
2,Not Really for Teens,"I was looking for some nonfiction to do with my high school students. I don't find these stories very easy to relate to. I was disappointed when I received this. After reading reviews, I was excited that maybe this collection would consist of great short pieces to use in my classroom. Unfortunately I haven't used any yet."
5,Best Moodies sound of all the Solo Albums from the Moodies,"This is a great album that was the next logical step after 9 years of recording his great songs with the Moody Blues. Listening to the album(or CD)gets you to ask yourself the right questions. One of the alltime best albums in music history. If you like the Moody Blues, you'll love this album!"
4,H.P. Lovecraft brought to life,"Got this plush for my girlfriend for last Christmas. She screamed when she first saw it, but loves it and has it hanging from her ceiling."
5,Neato!,"My dad and I really like to play this game. The graphics are excellent. You can also adjust the difficulty levels to make it as challenging for you as you like. Not to mention blowing up stuff is a great way to end a bad day! We still have a long way to go on it, but I look foreward to trying to outsmart my dad on the dual action. Have fun!"
1,Cap'n Pete takes Angie for a sailboat ride,"Pot-bellied Cap'n Pete pontificates on the importance of having the halyard securely attached before attempting to raise the jib. Too bad he never actually shows us how. Blonde Angie, whose nautical attire includes a very short skirt, bends waaaay over as she tries to follow the Cap'n's instructions. How high will her skirt ride up her lovely thighs? Not high enough to make this DVD worth watching. Absolutely the worst instructional video I've ever seen."
3,A good introduction to Servlets and JSP,"Others have provided excellent reviews so I will just comment on a few items:1) The book does a good job at covering the basics of using servlets and JSP for a web application.2) Conversely, the book is stuck in the basics and instead of discussing more interesting topics it references the unpublished Volume 2. Very annoying.3) This is a book for beginners. If you have any web programming experience this may be too simple and with a very slow pace. Many more concepts could have been included without compromising the book."
2,UNABSORBING,HAVE NOT FINISHED YET - IT IS HARD TO GET INTO - DID NOT FIND IT INTERESTING ENOUGH. MAY GET BACK TO IT
3,Marginalization of the elite,"A century ago, the British titled class was still God's elect: the wealthiest, most powerful, and most glamorous segment of the population. Then things began to fall apart and this rather scholarly work attempts to explain why. The popular assault on ""landlordism,"" the proliferation of titles, the democratic revolution, the question of Irish independence, the escape of many of the nobility to the farther corners of the empire where they could still wield something like their old power, the institution of life peerages, plus the leveling effects of two world wars -- all took their toll and resulted in today's titled elite becoming, for the most part, an elegant anachronism surviving precariously on the margins of British society. The author's style and wit are especially evident in his vignettes of such characters as Wilfrid Blunt, Lord Howe, and the Mitford sisters, but this book will still demand some intellectual commitment from the reader."
1,bad disk,"Not sure if it was a good cd or not, I assume it was just by looking at songs on the sleeve, but the disk would not work. I didnt want to try to waste time sending it back. thats a pain,"
2,CD not compatible with car CD player.,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, soonly choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
2,"Decent sound, doesn't last long!","I purchased one of these first generation speakers off of eBay. It only lasted for around 2 months of maybe 20 hours use total before it broke. I would suggest not using Sonic Impact speakers at high volumes since it shakes around and scratches the surface of your table top with the rear stand. Also, it doesn't last long when it starts to rattle around. The sound can get incredibly loud without distortion though. However, doesn't last long and doesn't sound rich."
3,"Looks nice, but only average","I too was swayed by the big discount, but these are not much better than the average ... Sony earphones you can find pretty much everywhere. Nevermind sound quality mentioned by the other reviewer, they're not nearly as comfortable and the case has a major flaw - the cord is not enclosed! There is only a recessed ring to wrap it around... only the buds themselves fit in the plastic top (and not very well). At least it's a cool color and happens to match both my laptop and digital camera.I have been dying to find some decent earphones, preferably self-retracting because the cords get so unwielding, but the Jensen does not appear to be much better. The in-line volume control is a nice addition. Overall, I would say, keep looking."
3,Mannhattan's And Murder,"Jessica is going to New York City to promote her book, and she even appears on Larry King Live. She see's someone she reconizes from Maine, and takes a picture with a disposible camera. The rest of the book snowballs from there. This was the second Murder She Wrote book I read, but I thought it was kind of slow, and real dumb at some parts."
5,right on the money,"Forget sony...these headphones are where its at. Seriously, for 30$, these headphones are amazing. My ears were given quite the treat when I put on the latest sigur ros album with these headphones on. Ive yet to hear much that compairs to them."
3,Not bad...,"The DVD isn't bad, but it's a little 'cheap' and pretty repetitive. Don't get me wrong, the colors are nice and my daughter speaks Spanish so the educational value is good. The South American accents are annoying though to be honest (granted I am Puerto Rican). I wouldn't buy it again, but my 3 year old daughter doesn't mind it."
4,Better than expected!,"I wasn't sure how good the watch was going to look in my hand rather than online and I must say I was very impressed. It looked great! It didn't have that fake yellow-gold shine to it and the indiglo face was the best. My only issue was unless you have a big wrist, the band will need adjusting and unfortunately, it's a stretch band and not a removable link one. Other than that, it looks great and the quality is pretty good."
3,Great product but does not come with mini adaptor as description says,"The microSD chip works great when inserted into the SD adapter or in the micro reader that I already have. However, it did not come with the mini adpater as the description says. Thus, I had to only give it 3 stars instead of 5. The price is great for what I got though (less than 7 dollars (including S&H;)). 2GB SD cards are running around 12 dollars in the stores (plus the gas to get there).Also note, there is a lock slider on the SD adapter so that the chip can be but in write-protect-mode. Thus, in the lock position, your data will be read-only (and may ""appear"" not to work if you are attempting to add or delete information). Just slide the slider up to the unlock position."
4,No drama!,"As titled, no drama. The shipment arrived on time, and worked as advertised. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again."
5,Can't go wrong with SanDisk!,"I got this 2GB card for my phone, a Blackberry Curve 8310. I've had it for about 6 months now with no problems. Works great! Have not filled it up yet either, not due to trying! I have quite a few pictures on there and some music. I would highly suggest it! Believe me, it will take you awhile to fill up 2GB (the camaras only a 2MP on these phones, but still look good)."
1,DBROTH Customer Service is Horrible,"Seller sent me the wrong item, one without the MiniSD adapter. I bought this item so that I could transfer data to it using my phone (with a miniSD slot) and move to my wife's phone (MicroSD). Customer service will not respond, I plan on disputing the charge with my CC company at the end of the week."
5,THE BEST FEMALE CD OF THE MILLINEUM,"Sherrie Austin is without question the BEST female singer in country music today. And once again, she proves it. There are a number of 10/10 on this CD: The best is ""My Brilliant Mistake"", but ""Back Where I Belong"", The title track, and ""In The Meantime"" are also flawless songs. ""Jolene"" is a song I always have detested, it did not matter if it was Dolly Parton, Martina McBride, or the worst of all: Olivia Newton-John, I dislike the lyrics. Sherrie, managed to get me to at least tolerate the song. This is a must have CD, simply put the best CD of the millineum."
4,Good Headphones,"Good head phones for a decent price. They feel kinda loose on my head at times, but they have good sound"
2,I DONT GET MUCH SOUND,I used max volume levels.....but I dont get much sound....i admit the files that I am trying to play are not that good....but my other headphones have a better amplifier .....do u guys have any idea how i can amplify the volume at software level.......any inputs are appreciated....my email id is list_satish@yahoo.com
1,They just don't fit.,"i got these home, sat down, and put these on my head. the first thing that i found was that the head pillow thing just anoyed the hell out of me, making the headphones feel 3 times bigger than they really are. the second thing is the shape of these damn things. they don't fit flush against my head, only the bottom actualy contacts my skull. the upper part of the head phone is floating just behind my ear. this allowed too much ambient noise to dissolve the audio i was listening to. witch is an over statement. when the volume was turned all the way up on both, the audio became raspy. and the individual audio control, while clever for the people with a hearing disability, is more annoying to the average user. don't buy these. just don't. buy the Philips SBC HP550 instead, There 100 times better than these pieces of crap."
5,Great for children,"I was in the market for a set of headphones that would fit my child's head without slipping and be durable enough to withstand the handling of a six year old. This was the perfect solution. I was pleased with the fit, the durability, and the output of the sound!"
3,"Pretty good sound, but uncomfortable","The sound isn't bad for the price-- fairly clear and good bass, but nothing spectacular. I agree with other reviewers that these don't fit well: I wear a size 7.5 hat (large), but the Philips 170 headphones felt huge and didn't cover my ears entirely. Maybe if they would fit better, they'd sound better. Also, the individual left-right volume controls are silly and if you mess with them, you'll have trouble adjusting them back to normal.On the plus side, these seem pretty sturdy compared to other headphones that I've bought... and the sound is pretty good for the price (good enough to make me want to wear them even if they don't fit quite right)."
4,Great option for computer audio system,"This amp and a $15 regulated power supply replaced a Hafler DH-220 that was drawing 120 watts at idle and 180 watts in operation. This set up will eventually pay for itself in power savings. As a bonus, it sounds as good or better in my computer audio system.Initially, the amp was really bright and harsh, but I let it run with an input signal for 72 hours and the sound improved significantly. I wasn't really a believer in ""break-in"" for solid-state electronics, but the sound did improve over time. I have a separate high end system, so it's not just becoming accustomed to the T-Amp.The T-Amp and power supply combination isn't especially attractive, but it fit in with the rest of my hardware environment. I see that there is a version two T-Amp with power supply close to the price I paid for the amp and separate power supply."
5,How do they do it???,"How can a low-priced amp possibly sound this good. This is the best kept audio secret of all time. I have mine connected to a SACD player through a ASL passive (tube)pre-amp. I turn the volume control on the SI all the way up and adjust volume with the pre. The sound that comes out of my high-efficency Horn Shoppe Horns is nothing short of amazing. Wide soundstage, incredible imaging and totally no audible noise. I own two and I'm looking for a third to hot-rod. Caution: If you are going to use in a home stereo rig, the speakers should have an efficiency of 90 or better to get the sound levels you'll want. Amazing!"
1,Waste Of time,"I bought this mini amp to power my 2 20 watts speakers and it never worked, don't waste your monies as its nothing more then a toy."
5,Guitar's Greatest Player,"Here is a chance for all Gary Moore fans, and folks who have never seen/heard him play, watch musics finest guitarist in action. This film was recorded when Gary was still entirely into ""Rock"", but there are many moments when his sweet playing - blues, pop, etc., are displayed. If you were a fan of Thin Lizzy, you will see Phil Lynottes last appearance onstage before his death, singing Pariesienne Walkways with GM. A very poignant moment indeed. Check this one out. END"
2,Too much Dave - too little garbage trucks,"We (my 3.5 year old son and I) just watched this video. Too much time was spent watching Dave and Becky act silly. Not enough time was spent showing how the garbage trucks work on the inside. For instance, an animation showing how the compactors work inside the trucks would have been much more interesting than watching Dave being tossed inside a garbage pail. Also, too little time was spent discussing recycling. It was more of an afterthought."
2,YUCK,"OK - I like ""HOW TO"" books and I like simple easy to understand things WITH LOTS of pictures? WHY? Because this is a GRAPHICS PROGRAM! Show me how it works and how it is supposed to look! This won't do that - I am already in school so I don't want to STUDY TECHNICAL JOURNALS to get FLASH!"
2,"Ok, but rather a disappointment","This book did not match my expectations. It is fun to flip through and look at some of the images, but most of the photos are not very well done, too cluttered with everything, but the cats. The layout of the book is too cluttered, confusing too. That said, there are a few very nice shots and overall it's a fun book, but i still put it down with a bad taste in my mouth. If you're looking for cool pictures of animals in nice pet-friendly surroundings, but ""Animal House Style"" by Julia Szabo. It's a so much better book!"
1,"Very misleading title, average book","This book has absolutely nothing to do with ""market maker's edge"". I'm an advanced trader and would be interested to see things from a market maker's perspective. This book ended up telling me to ""trade with the trend"" and ""cut my losses early"".If you're a beginner, might be helpful. But then again, there are tons of other books that teach you the same stuff better. I recommend the book called High Probability Trading."
4,Somebody's Daughter,Interesting story that also gives a glimpse of life for the ordinary person in Korea. I did not understand her feelings about her adoptive parents.
5,Visceral and Engaginig,"A book that makes you both think and feel. Wow! We've all had times when we feel like ""a stranger in a strange land"" or wonder who we really are at our core. Now take that and multiple it times ten. The book is very engaging because it is a journey on several different levels simultaneously -- a travelogue through a land that is still exotic to many, the heart-wrenching search for the truth no matter how painful the search or what you find at the end (You want to know, but do you REALLY want to know???), and a twisted, convulted life journey that's leading to well, who knows where.You follow this major tuning point in this young woman's life and know that her courageous yet frightening choice will inevitably alter the trajectory of her life. The question is -- will she find the answers or once completed, will she wish she had never embarked on this quest?Eminently readable, enjoyable and thought-provoking."
4,Easy & durable,"I bought this to use with my GF's 4 year old. I read some good reviews about it and they were all true. With no internal supports to speak of there are no cross-bracers to bend or snap. The airfoil design makes it very easy to use with even a slight breeze. It will often take off from the ground if it is facing right-side up after landing. Which is very nice because you always don't have to have that second person running out to get the kite and hold it up, as is sometimes the case with some traditional kites. I would highly recommend this to anyone just looking for an enjoyable starter kite with little hassle."
5,The Art of The Art of Batman Begins,"After seeing BATMAN BEGINS, I realized that I have just watched a movie that has so much more to tell me. But how can I find out more about the locations used, the props made, the characters and the creative process? ""The Art of Batman Begins"" satisfied my thrist for that knowledge. It's a great book that makes you appreciate the little things about BATMAN BEGINS and makes you proud to be a person who paid $10 to see it at the Cineplex. Hollywood has given us less than stellar films in the last couple years, it's good to see that the makers of BATMAN BEGINS still wanted us, the audience, to have a magical, wonderful movie going experience."
2,Use with caution! Not completely objective.,"This book does offer some good general information but use caution when using it to evaluate a cruise company. I admit this is a very hard thing to do... but it could have been done more objectively. Having sailed numerous cruises, I was a little shocked to find the reviews glowing on one particular cruise line. The other competing lines were being given very dry, somewhat negative reviews, instead of an accurate desciption of the ambience they deserve. Wondering why... I finally read the dedication... and may have figured it out... it is dedicated to the founder of that glowing cruise line... he died in 1999... and the author thanks him for their friendship.DO NOT use this book as the sole authority on what cruise line to sail. Talk to as many previous cruisers as you can find. Then get a travel agent that has invested some time studying the cruise industry.Cruises are wonderful... it does pay to be informed properly!"
3,Boxing,This is one of many Grandes Pealas dvds i own. I think i like this one the least. Three fights on this dvd and two of them have spanish commentary wich makes it alot less enjoyable for me. The Zarate-Zaragoza fight is in english. The Marquez vs Barrera fight is in Spanish and really was not a great fight in my opinion. I expected more action from Marco Antonio Barrera. still it is a nice edition to my fight libarary.The Raton Macias fight is black and white and also in spanish. Great if you speak that but i have just very little understanding of it.
1,Enclume potr rack and chain,"I ordered a pot rack and 12 feet of chain. Amazon ordered the chain in 12 inch lengths rather that 12 inch multiples. They advised me that they could NOT correct their ordering method, and if I needed lengths longer than 12 inches, I would have to order elsewhere, which I did. The manufacturer sells it in any length you want, but Amazon is not capable of ordering it as you need it, only as they want to sell it."
2,Hate it...going back to XP,Vista is horrible. It sucks up free hard-drive space like it's going out of style. After continiously getting the low space error I was able to clear the disk partition to 2.3 gig free and within hours it was down to 1/2 a gig for no reason. While some of it's features are kinda neat it's not worth the hassle. I just bought a copy of XP Pro and will be redoing my OS tonight. Stay away if you have a choice.
1,Windows Vista.....I'll Stick With XP,"I had high hopes for the latest version of Windows, Vista. It looks stunning when you first load it, but expect the performance to match the look. Unless you have a very Vista capable PC, this product will not perform well at all. I have an Athlon dual core CPU with 2G or RAM and I experienced major lock-up when doing the simplest of tasks."
2,installing vista crashed my system,I admit I am an idiot to try and install vista too early in it'slifespan.I have to get some very advanced help to get my computer backup to speed.I will get back with a review once I have it installed successfully.What really ticks me off is there is no easy way to get help from Microsoft... I have to seek out and pay for a consultant to clean upthe mess.
1,Vista is not progress.,"Makes my brand new expensive computer crawl like a turtle. I don't understand why Microsoft thinks we need a huge operating system that uses 90% of our computers resources? Why? In my opinion an OS should be light and operate quietly in the backround. It's supposed to be just a tool for productivity!Microsoft has gotten way too big for it's britches. I think they have forgotten the basic philosophy of a good operating system. Progress isn't measured by time it's measured by ingenuity, and Vista has nothing to offer. Also I'm highly suspicious of all the positve reviews. Don't believe them, Vista is terrible."
3,VISTA woes,"I bought Windows XP PRO instead. I need something stable and able to run Window apps VISTA won't. They released this unfinished IMO, driver issues. MAC OS 10 forced them to get this late project out the door. Not sure of it's value over XP other than eye candy. It really should have been a service pack for XP. I think Microsoft has reached it's zenith and will never be as powerful as it was several years ago...all things change including companies."
1,Vista is a sorry software,"Give Amazon a negative 10 for recommending and selling Vista software. The software is complete junk. I know that Amazon didn't design this software, but Amazon should have at least checked out Vista before they sold it. If they would have checked out the software first they would have known that Vista is a complete failure. It will be a long time before I can trust Amazon again."
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT GET VISTA!!!,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST OPERATING SYSTEM EVER CREATED!!! DO NOT GET VISTA FOR ANYTHING!! IT IS FULL OF GLITCHES. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE MICROSOFT ADS!! Your computer WILL freeze, it WILL crash, and be 10 times slower! Vista also leaves your computer completely open to viruses and spyware.The windows 95 was a better operating system. VISTA CONVINCED ME TO FINALLY GET A MAC, WHICH WAS BY FAR THE BEST COMPUTER BUYING DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE! The mac operating system is completely user friendly, fast, no crashes, and NO VIRUSES!!! It's just so better organized... and with no glitches to report yet. PLUS, IT'S READY TO USE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!DO NOT GET VISTA, GET A MAC!!!"
3,Doesn't Come Packaged With 64-bit Version!?,"I just purchased Vista Home Premium Upgrade, and I opened it up only to find an insert in the packaging that says if I want the 64-bit version, I have to order it separately from Microsoft.Wasn't the 64-bit support the whole point of Vista!? I know I didn't pay $159.99 for a slightly new interface!While the DVD is free, you still have to pay shipping... not to mention wait for something you thought you were getting now."
5,Software,I got what I needed and in great shape. Solved all my software problems.I would buy from this vender again. Good job.
3,Better than any other OS from this time period just buggy,"All your games and programs will work great with Vista and the new inferface looks more appealing and well designed than any other OS but this was prior to the service packs and Vista was very buggy. This version of Windows I found second only to Windows ME in terms of bugs and crashing..it also seemed to cause major slowdowns in systems I had in installed on. Windows 7 was a major improvment in stability and is the greatest OS to date on any platform, then Windows 8 improved on speed, reliability and user friendliness. Even if you own a mac get Windows 7/8 is you want to be able to do much outside the Apple store."
2,Wait!,"With XP, I went years with little to no problems. I upgraded to Vista Home Premium and the problems are flooding in with no end in sight. I blue screen 4 to 6 times a week, my printer isn't supported (no printing :-o!), my USB joystick is not yet supported, the help is not working properly, the new ""Sidebar"" is sending me error messages constantly, my DVD writer does not burn ( and won't until Vista SP1 comes out), games run slower eventhough I have dual core, many of my old programs have stopped working others crash in the middle of operation, and so on and so on...One day Vista might be good, but right now I'm sorry (very sorry) I bought it."
1,Beware,"When you buy the upgrade for XP it will not allow you to keep your current programs or data if you have XP Pro.That means your pictures,music,games,programs and whatever else would be wiped clean then re-installed.Now for me ,who has been using this computer for 4 years with almost 400 gigs of stuff can't do that.So I give Vista 1 star for a cool box and being slick enough to get $150 dollars from me for a new coaster for my drinks."
1,Don't do it!,I just bought a new computer with vista on it and half my software will not run. I'm going to return the computer and order one with XP!
3,Nice but buggy !,"I have a high end ""new"" PC-Athlon 64 X2 with 3 gigs of ram. The event viewer regitered many errors with this product installed. All drivers were updated and I still had random lockups and hangs. The scariest issue was when powering down the PC the PC would turn off but the monitor would still show that it was shutting off. Ater the PC would cycle on and off twice then it would turn off. These issues still happened after a complete reformat to XP and a reinstall. Stay away for now."
2,My System Wasn't Up To Speed,"I'm sorry I didn't listen when I was advised to wait until I purchased a new PC. For Windows Vista, your system may lack resources. Though it will run, it runs much slower. At least with Windows XP, I could play my movies on DVD. My video card was not up to snuff for Windows Vista. I had driver problems but finally got the right ones. I found I was happier with Windows XP, so I went back to it."
1,Don't waste your money,"As an expert computer user, (started with DOS) I would have to say that this is the worst piece of junk conceived by man. I would give it zero stars if I could. DO NOT down grade your computer with this junk. You will pull your hair out installing it. It will crash. It is much slower than XP. It takes forever to boot. And You Will Be Sorry!!!!!!!! Bill gates will laugh all the way to the bank with your money. The clowns in Redmond WA finally drove me to buy a MAC, and I could not be more pleased with OS X. I hope that this is the beginning of the end for Microjunk."
1,not working properly,"I pruchased this compass through Amazon market place. Antoline was the seller. DON NOT ever get anything from ANTOLINE because they will not pay for the return shipment regarless of the reason for returning. If you buy an defected item, you still have to pay for the shipping to send it back to them. Their customer serices were horrible and unreasonable. Thank god I purchased through Amazon and Amazon will step in and solve the problem."
1,Doesn't work,"Bought this for wife. Works fine in kitchen, but does not work in her RAV 4 Toyota. To return, 15% restocking fee plus shipping, and we are close to what it cost originally.You would think they would not sell this thing if it has this kind of problem."
1,Elites never sacrifice.,"In this book Mr. Bennett says ""Many of us have forgotten what we once knew about our freedoms and our decencies, and we have forgotten why, time and time again, we have had to rally ourselves to the point of ultimate sacrifice to defend them,""Mr. Bennett never describes what these decencies are. For example, gambling is legal but many find this distasteful so is gambling not a decent thing to do? T But the big fault I have with this book is that Mr. Bennett tells us that we must sacrifice but Mr. Bennett has not sacrificed by serving in the military which for me makes him appear to be an elitist."
5,ToyVault Makes the best plush! Get all the Godzilla Line for your kids!,"Excellent quality, my daughter loves them, I initially got her the Large Godzilla, such a big hit, now she loves the movies... had to get the rest, great attention to detail, ToyVault makes the best, products"
3,Boots made for sniffing.,"I met a guy in a club the other night, right, and he was wearing these boots. Pretty chill brah, if I do say so myself, and the first thing I noticed about him was these boots. So obviously they are pretty stand out boots. He was looking tall and scruffy in these boots and things went from there. Well to end the night, I look over at him and he's not in his seat anymore. No, he's now sitting on the ground below me with his nose in my armpit. He was sniffing my pit! Hell no, I won't go letting a guy sniff these pits on the first date. And it wasn't even a date. Practically a pit sniff rape.The boots are still pretty studly, so they get three stars, even if the wearers of them are creeps."
3,Good book but lack some information,"I was disappointed after I bought and read this book. Too many people gave it a five star. I will give this one 3.5 but this is not a choice in the drop-down box. SQL Server system tables and system stored procedures are very important. This books doesn't give me much information. Microsoft might not want DBAs and developers to really know the inside of SQL Server 7.0. OLAP and Data Warehousing are also two very important areas. I can't find these topics in the content. MSDN library is a much better resource for writing sql statements or queries. You will know the syntax and more examples. Overall, this is still a good book."
4,An Outstanding SQLServer 7.0 Book,This book and SQL Server 7.0 Book on line (come with the product) helped me become a MCDBA. I really enjoyed reading chapter 13 and 14.
4,A Fine Story For Children,"Not Bill Peet's best work, but stil a good story. Hubert the Lion experiences a downfall when he loses his beautiful mane and is forced into hiding.A chivalrous elephant comes to his rescue by setting out on a difficult journey to retrieve the hair tonic that the Lion needs.But the fun just begins."
2,So hard!,"I was excited about this game because I love dragons, but I had to give up playing it...it's SO hard. I admit that I'm not the greatest video game player in the world, but I don't suck, but this was beyond me. I kept dying and having to start again way before the point at which I died, and I just couldn't take it anymore because I was so frustrated.Maybe I'll try playing it again (and look for cheats or something) but I cringe when I see it sitting on the shelf because I wasn't able to beat it--nowhere even close! I only played a couple of hours so it wasn't like I was trying to kill the last guy or anything.Too bad, because I was looking forward to playing this game to the end."
3,It's okay,"We bought this for doing reviews on 7 people. I use this on every review as it does make each review look more professional and you can get them done quicker. The downside is that all the reviews tend to have the same look, same wording and often the identical paragraphs."
5,Excellent,"I thought this was a great item! It is really low priced, and it does exactly what I need it to. It works with all my camcorder batteries and allows me to charge while on the road or away from a computer. I recommend this item to anyone who needs to charge batteries while on vacation- you will get more than what you payed for."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product! It worked fine for in a pinch, but it broke within a week of getting it. I won't purchase this product again and won't recommend it to anyone."
1,less than thrilled,"My product got lost in the mail, which come to find out is not that uncommon with Eastbay. When I called to report what had happened, I found out that they were out of my husband's size. Needless to say, I had to get him the next size up and it was way too big. In their defense, they did mail me the replacement free of charge through rush shipping."
4,Exceeded expectations,"I've never heard of this author so I didn't know what to expect. Anyway, it was certainly worth the money. I laughed out loud more than a few times. The ""Princess"" character is the best of the women he writes about. (Since it's a memoir, I guess they aren't characters... But the style is novelistic. Anyway, I just instinctively liked this girl.)"
5,Very funny and entertaining book!,"At first, I thought this book was a cheesy and worthless one. But man, I was wrong. This book is really one of the best and funniest books I've ever read. This really hits home. Actually when I was reading it, I found myself laughing out loud. I guess people around me thought I'm nuts. Also, The ballpen-english-practice conversation is so hilarious! I like the ""princess"" character too."
4,An Organized book,"Emilie Barnes' book Cleaning up the Clutter, is a conglomeration of ideas you may find in some of her other books but they are organized into a cohesive system that is easy to get your arms around. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a system of organization for their home."
3,Frustrating,"The game alternates between acrobatic maneuvers that are somewhat difficult but managable, and battles that are nearly impossible to win. Overall, I found it very frustrating to get to the big battles and get killed repeatedly, and finally gave up without completing the game."
2,frustrating,"I imagine video games are supposed to be fun to play, but this is about as much fun as filling out a tax return. Lovely graphics (that's why I gave it 2 stars), but the game control is truly awful - see other reviews here for details. Shame, as I loved the earlier tomb raider games.It just seems bizarre that the TR game developers don't appear to read these customer reviews on their products, take notes, and consequently don't keep making the SAME mistakes, over and over and over again...... sighhhhhhhh"
5,A Christmas to Remember,"This entire series ""Cape Light"" has been wonderful. I guess so far A Christmas to Remember"" is my favorite. It would be great for readers to have another series by ""Kinkade & Spencer"" to enjoy reading. B. Parker"
3,Too much christmas,I love the christmas season but the year doesn't stay at christmas time all the time. Authors need to include other times of year into their story.
4,Excellent illustrative method on abstracting persistence,"The book was very useful in defining and illustrating a loosely coupled business and data layer. The author clearly defines the goals that should be strived for in abstracting persistence of business objects in N Tier designs. I would have liked the book to go into a bit more depth in the certain critical areas, i.e. transaction processing, performance tuning, data cache, ..."
2,Confusing,"I bought this album because it won the album of the year from Jazztimes, I listen to it about 10 times and I still can't get it. There is no cohesion to the music, no doubt the players are really good but it leaves me feeling confused."
4,Harley Davidson steering wheel cover,This is a nice Harley Davidson steering wheel cover. It feels good in my car. I would recommend for others to buy one.
2,"Great keyboard, terrible mouse","This is a good idea with a good price for wireless keyboard and mouse. There are extra special feature keys such as web navigation and media controls.The keyboard operates very smoothly - very few hiccups in terms of missed keystroke. I chose not to install the special keyboard shortcuts. Still I found myself accidentally pressing the Standby key instead of Esc... and it would go into Standby.As for the mouse, the instructions say to keep it (and receiver device) away from electro-magnetic sources to avoid interference. Unfortunately, no matter where I placed the devices, the mouse kept jumping all over the screen. It was virtually useless. I ended up not using the devices.I had a PC, monitor, cordless phone and sometimes other EM emitting devices in close proximity. There was no practical way to re-arrange them. So if you have a simple office with extra desk space, this mouse may work for you - but be skeptical."
2,too much repetition,"Seems like the 3 authors wrote this book without communication amongst each other. There is a lot of repetition, this book is over 600 pages and could be summarized in 100pages. In each chapter you re-read over and over again the stuff you've just read.It is also quite elementary...the quizz at the end of each chapter are really basic and nothing like the MCQ you get in a college class...The good point is that there are a lot of examples."
4,Recommended,"Fraud Examination is an excellent forensic accounting/anti-fraud textbook. The content is presented in a way that is very easy to understand. The many examples and cases throughout the text aid students' comprehension, engaging their interest in the material itself and in the field of fraud examination as a whole.I also like the fact that ACL is included with the book."
5,Fine Book -- One Caveat,"I ordered this book thinking that it was, as stated in one of the reviews, the sequel to Conaway's 1990 book ""Napa."" Actually, this edition IS the 1990 book, only published in 2002 by a different company, with a subtitle and without the photos that appeared in the earlier edition that I have. I enjoyed Conaway's book immensely when I read the earlier edition, but take care not to buy this edition thinking that it is the sequel."
4,Reads like a novel,"This is a very interesting and informative read about Napa that includes all the rich history, progess and hurdles, and sometimes scandal that contributed to what the Napa Valley is today. The book is written in such a way that it's almost more like a fiction novel but there's so much information packed into the pages, it truly is a history book of Napa. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to any and all ""wine geeks""......."
5,Amazing historical account of one of the most romantic regions of the United States,"This is an amazing social history of U.S. Wine Country. I bought the book on my way to Napa for the first time and it was fascinating to read about the early days of the wineries my husband and I toured: Mondavi, Niebaum and others."
5,great product,"EBC are my favorite brake pads. Work great, low noise and dust. Great Product for the money and quality that you can count on."
4,Good book,"This book keep me wanting more. I finished it in two days. The main character was someone I could really relate to, a woman attempting to love and find herself. I would recommend."
4,Close to Home,I thoroughly enjoyed reading Almost Doesn't Count as it hits close to home. I saw a lot of myself in Mercedes Jackson. She took a long journey to find herself and when she was finally able to love herself her world opened up. Thanks Electa for empowering women and using your gift to uplift us all.
5,Excellent,"Rick Riordan can flat out write. I was hooked after reading his first book, ""Big Red Tequila."" This may be the most ""mature"" Navarre book to date and will leave you wanting more. I couldn't put this book down and literally flew through it. Now I am left anxiously awaiting his next book. I highly recommend any book by Riordan; keep 'em coming Rick."
5,Bought it for ex...,When I bought this it was for my girlfriend at the time. She's now an ex girlfriend but the music was good. She wasn't and that's why she's my ex!
4,Super Fast Delivery!,Loved this CD! Just in time for a birthday present after watching the movie on television. Super fast delivery and I didn't pay for the 'express' delivery either.
5,Awesome!,"You can listen to this CD anytime, anywhere, with anybody. I found myself realaxed and got a new thing for easy going jazz music."
2,Ticked about the lack of stuff here,"The whole problem with the Soundtrack is that the ""nice"" stuff, the stuff that made the movie feel ""ritzy"" and glamourous, the jazz and the piano, the Sting soundtrack and the rest of the stuff is here. But the music that rounded out the whole movie itself, such as the song from the lovemaking scene between Russo and Brosnson, is NOT here. The music from the original heist is not here. Hell, half the music from the whole thing isn't here. Which makes this, while a nice CD to listen to, NOT what I'd even want to buy. I listened to it, I returned it to the rack, and I walked out. I wouldn't buy it, and MGM better start figuring out the amount of space that a CD actually has, and what is DECENT music to listen to, and what is not.Welcome to the digital world, RIAA."
4,A Little Gem,"I like this soundtrack quite a bit. Not only does it play well in the background of the original movie (a 3 out of 5 for me), but it has some great finds on here that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Of course, ""Sinner Man"" by Nina Simon is one of the best, but so is ""Everything"" by Wasis. I can't honestly say that the rest of the unknown songs on the track may be as memorable (except for the Sting song), but it's a good buy. Again, makes for great background music...for a cocktail party, while working, or taking a leisurely drive."
4,Great Soundtrack for a Great Movie,"If only there was more than 12 songs. I loved TTCA, it's one of my favorite movies - I'm only disappointed that they chose only 12 songs from the movie score. They should have had more than that seeing as even though the 12 songs are good, there are other songs that are missing that I also wanted to hear. ALl in all, however, the CD is good, and the movie is better."
2,Good music but....,"The song by Sting is good and the piano-based songs near the end are too, but the CD is only 37 minutes long. With only half the music, I would hope it would only be half the price. The songs at the end are good, but each is only about two minutes long. As soon as you get into the song, it's over. If you like the music from the movie, but don't feel like spending this much for so little music, just buy the movie instead (almost the same price!). It's what I plan to do."
4,:0),"Dont know why it was rated low but i didn't think it was that bad, thats why i didn't almost get it.* The first story liked it but took too long to get to the point, its a short story so get to the point.* The second story liked it but not how it ended it felt like something was missing, liked the concept of the story though.* Third LOVED IT. It was great reading about Yorin & Jana's son if you haven't read Jaid Trek series then you will be lost understanding the book or might not like it, the series is good would recommend."
3,About what you'd expect for the price,"This is my second set of these seat covers. The first set lasted about 4 years. The fit decently but it's nowhere near a factory look. It is obvious that you have seat covers on your seats. They hold up fairly well. The points where you slide on your seat getting into and out of your car will get thin then tear. I drive about 20,000 miles a year and these lasted about 4 years. They are decent enough that I bought them again."
3,Technical Difficulties,"The playing on this CD is stellar. But the sound is so dreadful, that it really eliminates the enjoyment for me. It sounds on some tracks like the sound of a screeching tape going through the tape recorder is part of the recording. ""Half Nelson"" (track 5) in particular has this screech and it occurs also on several other tracks such a ""Tempus Fugit."" The playing is extraordinary with Sonny Rollins' sax blowing me away. However, because of this sound level, I'm going to return this and opt for other Davis recordings. Taxi!"
4,Kitchen Talk,"Yes this is a 'Sistah girl' book, meaning a healthy dose of male bashing takes place, but the bashing is so good-natured that no offense can be taken. I felt like I was in the kitchen with my favorite Aunts listening to their loving critiques on the romantic exploits of various female family members. You know, those women who 'lose their minds' over men. I can see the raised eyebrows and hear the sympathetic clucking as Auntie fires off another salvo in the direction of the foolish girl. Definitely a fun commuter read!"
4,One of the best horror/sci-fi animes on the market-period.,"First of all, this movie isn't for everyone. There are reasons why this movie has a label specifically saying ""Not to be sold to people under 18"". But this is the case with most anime videos that come to the states. This video contains a great plot, drawing to die for and unfourtunately nudity. I've seen worse displays, being a fan of anime, but never have any of the other videos been taken off the market. The action is very kinetic and horror film fans will have a lot to like. The more sensitive material isn't really that bad and doesn't detract from the story any more than a live action film. If you've seen Ninja Scroll, Fist of the North Star, or Crying Freeman, you won't be suprized at anything here-- but you won't be disappointed either!"
2,Lots of great cheese in this movie.,"When I first saw Wicked City, I was bit disapointed in it because I had seen the anime by the same title first. I had expected it to be of the same story line except with live action. Well the anime version was a better story, but the cheese factor in this movie just makes me want to grab a bowl of popcorn and veg out on the couch. It's special effects are a bit low budget but they are fun to see."
1,I don't get it,"Cheesy, nearly incomprehensible (and that's WITH subtitles) movie about shape-shifting monsters fighting against a select group of Asians known as ""The Anti-Monster Squad.""Not a whole lot of this movie makes sense. There are subplots concerning a romance between a human and a monster, between various family members inside the monster family, and someone working in the Anti-Monster Squad betraying them to the monsters.Folks, there are a couple of choice moments in this flick. I think this is the only movie I've ever seen where a man has sex(?) with a pinball machine and our heroes are antagonized by a large, circular clock while making every dumb ""time"" joke you can imagine.However, this clearly belongs in the bargain bin, or even in the trash can. Don't waste your time with this. It isn't worth it."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I bought one and it never worked right. Bought it at Office Depot, they would not replce after 30 days, so I shipped to Brother and they sent me another- it didn't work right either. My guess is the networking setup just doesn't work. Can't scan, or print labels or envelopes.Called Brother back and they wouldn't do anything more, so I just had to replace at my own cost"
2,"Good features, but very poorly built.","The printer has many good features, but it's noisy and very slow. Worse, it broke (the paper feeder stopped working, the diagnostic screen indicated a paper jam) after 3 years of extremely light use (well less than a 1000 pages total!!!). Not recommended."
1,Difficult to fix paper jams,"Paper jams often. Back door is almost impossible to open to fix any paper jam. Ink reads ""low"", when it is only half-empty. Will never buy another Brother printer again."
1,Awful,"Do NOT buy this product. Every other time you switch it on it will insist on cleaning itself.I only print black text, yet when I really need to print colour (for an important document, for example), I won't be able to. The reason is all my colour ink is gone because of the useless cleaning cycles.My HP printers never did this. The colour cartridges (even the low volume ones you get when you buy the printer) lasted twice as long."
3,Not working with Vista!,"in general the device is really good, the main problem is that many time sit just won't print, due to configuration problems with Vista os."
4,Undercounter water filter!!,"This product was exactly as advertised with the exception of the type of hook-up offered. The price was super, checked all over and you could not beat the deal Waterboy gives on these quality filters.....delivery on time and without problems.....in the future I would not order the quick disconnect, my plumber does not like them and says if the connection is moved much they will leak.....hopefully these will not. Otherwise I will definitely do business with Waterboy again!!RP345"
4,"Good book, but too heavy","This is a very good book. Good quality, good design. But it's too heavy, I can't lift it with one hand. It presses my belly much when I read it on bed."
4,"Excellent narrative (oh, but where are the maps?)","This book provides a wonderful way of learning history -- interestingly written and great pictures and photographs. The only thing lacking (and a major omission) is maps. In covering world history over its complete span, the reader cannot be expected to know the exact location of the Asian Steppes or Bithynia. Please include adequate maps for the next edition."
1,What a disappointment!,"I picked up this book, hoping to find an exciting story about Mata Hari's life as a spy. Apparently Richard Skinner did not think we'd be interested in that--I read the whole book and still have no idea what country she spied for, how successful she was, or how she eventually got caught. Any time I found myself getting caught up in the story, Skinner abruptly changed narrators. If you want to read this book to learn more about Mata Hari, you will be let down."
1,dies after little use,"We use this here at the office to know which receiving door people are at. Bought Oct 2010, started using Jan 2011 and June 2011 it's dead. Replaced batteries, still nothing. Not worth the $30."
5,Great doorbell,"This doorbell is a great inexpensive replacement for an electric doorbell. When my front doorbell broke, I called an electrician and the service call alone was $75. I've been using this for over a month and regardless of temperature (it's been zero degrees) it works perfectly. I'm happy with my purchase."
1,Manfrotto Low Angle Adapter,"Even though the part number indicates compatibility with a 190 tripod, it is NOT compatible with my 190XBPRO tripod. The adapter goes in the hole vacated by the center camera post but there is way too much clearance for the adapter to fit snugly. And don't waste your time trying to contact Manfrotto Customer Support. Their email address is essentially a dead zone because no one in the USA apparently knows anything and any requests for support get sent to Italy. Fortunately it cost less than $9 for this paper weight and I can waste that much money on a hamburger."
2,An interesting idea but a bad story,"Wheeler's attempt to cross from screen-writing to novel writing is a disappointment. He has not grasped the intricaces and nuances of the medium, instead treating it like a television project or movie. The vocabulary is limited, the intelligence of the reader is underestimated, and the characters fail to ring true. By using almost exclusivly famous names of the begining of the last century, it almost feels like an article in People magazine about ""celebrities"". The reader cannot really relate to these people and therefore is always left feeling on the outside. I fear this is the sad result when stale, uninspired storytelling of the visual media invades the written world. Anyone who has decried the banality of TV shows will see this in The Arcanum. Now, having said that, the story of the Book of Enoch and the Lost Tribe is an interesting concept. Given more practice, perhaps Wheeler could actually produce a decent book about it. But not this time."
3,Good as far as it goes,"As previously mentioned, the references are more concentrated on the better known guitars. I suppose that is alright, as there are probably more trades made in that area. However, if one is seeking to find the undiscovered treasure, this book falls short. The details of the individual instruments are lacking and leaves one wanting to know more. I am please I have the book as a resource, but I will require additional information for some other sources as well. Don't rely on this book as your sole source, you will be disappointed. One should consider this as just one more source."
5,A MUST FOR COLLECTORS OR TRADERS`,"I DO ALOT OF BUYING/SELLING/TRADING, AND THIS BOOK HAS KEPT ME FROM MAKING MISTAKES AND HAS HELPED ME SCORE SOME PRETTY GOOD DEALS. I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY."
2,Not for the average reader,"This book has a lot of good information, but it reads like a research paper (which it was origionally, I think). Unless you're doing a research paper, there might me more helpful books to buy."
5,Great Movie & Great Action Figure,This thing is really good if you're into the movie like I am. Great detail and it's pretty fun!
4,Looks Great,My son was completely surprised by this christmas gift! He absolutely loves it...although we may never know what he says or how he works because he refuses to open the box!
3,a great product until it breaks,"Like other reviewers I find this a wonderful product for all around use and am actually buying a second one from Amazon.This second purhase is due however to the fact that my first machine worked for a few weeks and then had what customer service called ""drive problems."" After being returned for repair, it never worked as powerfully as on initial use and recently stopped running altogether. I probably used it 20 times total and feel that it was not worth the full purchase price."
4,Cordless Trimmer/Clipper,"This product works well for quick touch-ups on shrubs and bushes. The shrub attachment cuts small swaths (6 inch) and therefore is not recommended by me for large shrubs and bushes. I use my large gas powered trimmer for that (but that weighs a ton and is hard on your arms and shoulders), so for the occasional quick trim I use the cordless. The grass attachment works well around large plants that are not capable of withstanding a hit by my string trimmer, such as lilies and gladiolas. It works well in these situations but requires you to get on all fours to use it. The only other drawback is the run time, which is about 20-30 mins on a full charge, but that is fine with me since I only use it sparingly. The two cutter heads are easy to change as well."
1,Don't do it.,"Cheaply made, poor quality blades 7 switches. The battery totally died in less than a year. I later bought a similar one made by Skil. It was a little more expensive (not a lot), and it's holding up well. You can even tell the Skil product was better quality"
3,Noir style playing at serious metaphysical substance.,"Dark, tragic overtones signal the writing of a mystery writer with a mission. Psychological analysis, police argot and the props of a standard detective fiction swirl together in a readable hodgepodge of narration. What the author misses is the point of all this millenium-era angst."
2,"Amis takes you into the night, and leaves you there","An incredibly weak effort from a stylist and humorist of genius, 'Night Train' simply rejigs themes and ideas found in earlier books (the musings about the relative importance of motive in police investigations are directly lifted from 'The Information') and attatches them to a cliched, uninteresting narrative. The prose is somehow both crude and over-stylized - it seems like the work of a pop-song lyricist rather than a crime novelist (or a literary novelist) - and the extraordinarily bleak resolution really is very hard to swallow."
4,confused but amused,"mr amis has proved to be a little too clever for me this time around, and though i always find his verbal insights amusing, im not sure that i get quite what hes driving at: - ie why did she die ? its the emprerors new clothes innit ? answers appreciated !"
1,Jennifer Rockwell is the SUNNY PRESTATYN poster-girl,"Amis took a poster-girl from a poem and subtexted her into the stick-figure character of Jennifer Rockwell. The giveaway joke-name is Macatitch. Johnny Mac is one of the cops in NIGHT TRAIN. And Macatitch is a coy reference to Titch Thomas. Titch Thomas is a sleazebag vandal who defaced a poster in a poem called SUNNY PRESTATYN.Jennifer's gunshot wounds correspond to the poster-girl's knife wounds ""right through the moustached lips of her smile"". Tom Rockwell refers to Jennifer as having been ""sunny"" (page 29). The poster-girl wears ""tautened white satin"". On page 128 of NIGHT TRAIN, Jennifer ""came out of the cabana and walked toward us in her white one-piece"". From SUNNY PRESTATYN: "" a great transverse tear left only a hand and some blue"". From NIGHT TRAIN: ""A woman fell out of a clear blue sky""."
2,Short and Sour,"Short and sour, this is a story of an unconvincing suicide mystery investigated by an unconvincing woman ""police"" in an unconvincing Chicago. That it does not convince isn't even the main problem. The withholding of information from the reader is. We are told that of all the bodies Ms. Mike O'Hoolihan has ever seen, none has stayed with her like this one. Why? That Officer O'Hoolihan finds the reason for the suicide and doesn't share it, except for a corny reference to suicide being contagious, is downright sophomoric. No mystery here, just a good writer trying to hoodwink his reading public into thinking that he is consistently a good writer. Thanks for nothin' Mr. Amis."
2,Moves along well. . .but to where?,"Nicely written mystery (police procedural variety but without any real knowledge of police work). Unfortunately (for me), when I finished it (I read the last chapter twice) I couldn't figure out the answer. If anyone can help, please let me know--did she or didn't she and, if she didn't, who did?"
4,I'm Now a Martin Amis Fan,"After a very long spell of reading all non-fiction, I picked up my friend's copy of ""Night Train"" and couldn't put it down until the end. Amis manages to get inside the head of his amazingly interesting, real and vulnerable main character, Detective Mike Hoolihan. The only problems I had were Amis' sometimes off-the-mark American lingo, Hoolihan being a bit too intellectual for an ordinary cop, and the end was a bit underwhelming. Amis creates exciting, slim prose. Very good and entertaining read. I am now an official fan of Martin Amis."
4,A good book.,This book was given to me by a colleague who had travelled to Australia. It was curiously good. I found it to be uniquely exciting and different from the bulk of paperbacks available at airports. I would like to see more books like this and have told my colleague to send me the next book greenwald writes
5,Good CD,"The CD arrived very quickly, worked great, and had all of the songs on it that I wanted! What a great CD!"
4,Good tracks that arae hard to find on current CD's.,"If you don't have this album already for LP, I think you'd have a tough time finding them on a CD. This CD for me was worth the money. My personal favorites on this album are Bridge Over Troubled Water, and Stoney End. In fact, my jazz band conductor just handed out the music for Bridge Over troubled water today, but the music for the solo trumpet part was missing. Having heard the tune many times from when I listened to the CD, it was fairly easy for me to play my part. Very nice trumpet work and solo-ing in this album. (Also, maynard's pose is somewhat comical on the cover, so that's another reason to buy.)"
4,Good holding power,"I've been frustrated with magnetic tool holder strips in the past, too often the magnet is too weak to hold round-shaft tools like screwdrivers. So I tried this screwdriver holder and am generally pleased. It has plenty of holding power, and is solidly built. It has a high-friction back surface that doesn't seem to mar my cabinets. My only complaint: the holes are relatively small; too small to hold large screwdrivers or those N-in-one screwdrivers. But if you're in the market for this product, than you probably won't have any trouble drilling out the holes to suit your needs."
5,"Great record. Very eclectic, w unique modern songs & sounds","I've been following Sharif's career for a while now, and I gotta say, he definitely outdid himself on this record. I'm a casual acquaintance of his, and when he mentioned that members of Whiskeytown, Jason Mraz, and David Gray were on ""Surrogate Lovers,"" I had to pick it up. This album greatly surpasses his first. The songs are well constructed, and the some of the lyrics are phenominal. I've had ""60 Seconds"" on repeat in my car for about 2 weeks. I can tell a lot of time when into recording this record. The songs range from rock to grunge to alt-country to ballads, but somehow Sharif makes it all fit together. Well done Sharif, well done."
5,An ideal set for a bedroom,"My combo is white which appealed to me for my bedroom. It has an excellent picture on all channels [includes cable]. A separate swivel base is included, and its use is optional. I don't happen to need it. I would recommend this little jewel to anyone having a need for the features it has. I thought its price was very good, so all in all I am very satisfied with my choice. Dorothy S. Turner in Jenison, Michigan"
3,I don't recommend this dvd.,The sound was okay but the video was too dark. I couldn't see most of it! The song selections were good.
2,a good book about princess Grace wedding,"i think this book does not give us a different view about Grace Kelly. It is only a book related to the wedding dress and some miscelaneous comentaries about her life. You can find some good photos about Grace, but nothing else. If you are a great Grace fan like me, perhaps you would like to buy next book about Grace : Grace Kelly, a life in pictures, by Pierre Henry Verlhac."
5,Greatest watch ever.,It tells time (surprise surprise..)It has a chronograph.I've had it 3 years and the battery hasn't died once.It doesn't look to bad.For $11 you really can't do much better!
5,More beautiful than the picture !,"LOVE IT !!! It was packed so carefully,I was impressed ! It sits in my kitchen window,so it gets light,,,but not in direct sun. Hmmmmmm,may be buying another one.These plants are so interesting,I love just looking at it. Well done!!!"
1,Dont Do It!!!!!!!,After less than a year the battery stopped recharging. I left it out in the sun for two days hoping I could recharge the battery. After it stopped charging correctly I could not get it to work for more than an hour at a time. I would definitely not recommend this watch.
3,Add-a-Bed Twin Bed,"Convenient, comfortable and good price but a pain in the butt to keep sheets on mattress because of the slippery fabric. Finally took the air mattress out of the zipped cover and pinned mattress pad and sheets around the mattress and then pinned them to the bed skirt. No problem and everything works great now. - Diana"
5,Works Great!!!,I needed to add another one for the new TV in the garage. I have had my system for years and would highly recommend them. My system use's total of five IR's in five different rooms to control four DirecTV TIVO's centrally located in the garage.
5,Plenty of space,"I used this for a digital camera. The pictures and video come out very well. It holds plenty of pics, vids, and mp3s. great buy!!!!"
3,non-standard case,"I received an Ultra card, not Ultra II, and it was just loose in the box with my other Amazon item, with a sticker on it. The plastic case was rather odd, like it was made for some type of micro card with an SD reader. I'm not pleased with that, as it's twice as large a case that will not fit in my camera case as well. The seller in this case was Komputerbay. I've had other Sandisk Ultra cards and prefer them over standard cards for the faster speed, but If I was to order again, I'd pay a couple of bucks more for the retail package."
3,Not sure,"The image showed this as an Ultra II, but the product shows it as an Ultra. It's not as fast as previous SanDisk Flash Memories I have used - camera takes longer to write the image files.It's fine other than being slower."
5,UN BAILE DE RISAS...,"Que imaginacion! Ya habiendo leido un libro de Sergio Ramirez que fue de mi completo agrado, decidi leer un segundo y que certeza en el libro que escogi. Un libro no muy grande, pero lleno de humor de principio a fin. Con modismos y dichos Nicarguenses, pero sin duda algo que cualquier otro lector podra gozar al maximo pues tiene ese sabor que solo la raza hispano-americana posee. No solo lo recomiendo por el humor que contiene sino tambien por que es admirable la imaginacion usada y la creacion de personajes que hacen de este libro uno de esos que recomendamos a todos, pero no lo prestamos por miedo a que vayamos a perder el libro. Es una pequeña joya que es de guardar. Piensa en aquellas cosas buenas de las cuales la mayoria no sabe ni a oido, pero se lo estan perdiendo. Sin duda alguna un libro que me leeria dos veces. El que lo lea que lo comparta, este libro se lo recomiendo a todo tipo de lector."
1,Terrible,"What was this?????? If you were looking for a karoke sing along with Mitch type CD. Try Again!!!!You can't tell where the melodies start or finish. I know Linda Eder in my sleep, and this was a total waste of my money.I am totally disappointed. If you are looking for high quality instrumental then this is perfect and excellent. Prepare for a nap!kac"
1,"don,t be fooled",don't be fooled buying this product. It is for karaoke and there is NO Barbara nor Linda singing. I was totally disappointed.
1,Is this serious?,"I will be the first to say that Girl Talk's ""Night Ripper"" is simply incredible, and it never seizes to amaze me everytime I listen to it, which is approaching the thousands.This obsession led to a understandable Girl Talk high, prompting me to order this album.To be honest, I spent the first hour of owning it testing the CD in every disc playing device I owned, making sure that my ears weren't deceiving me. I was convinced the disc was severely scratched or damaged. However, I was completely wrong. The tracks are supposed to be like that.One of the most annoying things I can think of is a cd skipping, killing a mood. This entire album is intentionally like that, and it's repulsing.Purchase Night Ripper, which is nearly perfect, but under no circumstances purchase this album."
4,great gps,"Small,handy,user friendly. very fast lock time. lighted display for night time use for either going into or coming out the woods. 100 memories(landmarks) for all those important places you need in the woods or cities. never had less then 8 satellites in any given terrain so far."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Jacqueline of Hainault lived a very interesting life, and I enjoyed reading about her. I didn't relate to her character very well, but I found her to be intriguing nonetheless. When compared to other women of the time (such as Katherine of Valois) she seems to have been a rather weak woman in that she relyed entirely on her current husband to fight her battles for her.The only downfall about this novel is that it is quite short considering the amount of things that happened in Jacqueline's life. Yet perhaps the author didn't wish for the novel to become an overwhelming biography.Overall, the interesting life of an interesting woman."
2,"Great pictures, otherwise very dull","My daughter loves Lilo and Stitch. I should have read this book before purchasing it. The movie can get away with some complicated ideas as it is narrated after all. The book tries to hit the high points, which could really confuse a child. My daughter knows the story and she kept asking ""where's so and so?"" or ""what happened to...?"". So I basically use the pictures and tell the story in my own words. Then again, if I bought a book, I shouldn't have to do that!"
5,THE BEST RIOT ALBUM HANDS DOWN,lead singer Rhett Forester(now deceased)leads the ultimate Riot album every song has great solos from the title track to the cover of elo's devil woman.this album hasn't been released in the us and is worth the price if you are a big riot fan much better than the newer albums and a step above the earlier releases Narita and Fire down under. a great buy you will not regret
4,Much overlooked,Often overlooked but should not be forgotten. This album is not as good as the two before it but it definitely worth the buy. Riot remains one of the most overlooked bands of the 1980s best.
3,Schrafty,"Born in America is a solid early 80's metal record. It does include some exceptional songs like running from the law, heavy metal machine and the title track, but there are also a few fillers here. I'm an old school metal fan who graduated high school in the mid 80's, so I was big fan of Riot as well as other early 80's acts like Saxon, Motorhead, the Rods, Krokus, Accept and Iron Maiden. Anyway, Fire Down Under was Riot's crown achievement. Beleive me, I love Rhett as much as Guy even though there voices are completely different, but I just feel the songs are slightly better on FDU than Restless Breed and Born In America. I would put RB not far behind and BIA third on the list of the top 3 riot records. In the end, BIA is a must have for any old school metal fan."
3,"Good adventure story, but beware of graphic violence","Many reviewers have commented that this is a good adventure book, but I did not see any reviews that noted that it is quite graphically violent. I used this book recently for a mother-son book group of 5th grade boys. Several of the boys noted that they found the book very disturbing in its graphic imagery -- murders, hangings, rats, etc. and felt that the book was less enjoyable because of it. I would issue a warning that this book is not suitable for young or sensitive children. It is an ""easy read"" aside from some tough vocabulary, but is very intense."
4,Good for what I use it for...,"I have a black lab and I did not expect this item to do more than just pick up hair, dust and very small pebbles or whatever gets tracked in on someone shoes. For that purpose this little vac is great. I use the carpet mode even on the bare floor because it does not create a huge amount of suction. I could not see using this on carpet with any amazing result but for just the bare floor it is fine. It is perfect just to grab quickly and do a quick once over. I received an extra battery with my unit. Not bad for $21.99 but if you want something to do carpets this is not for you. Spend a couple more dollars and get something with a cord and more bristles."
3,"2 down, no more for me!","I received this as a wedding gift 6 years ago and thought this was the best to clean the dog hair off the kitchen floor. When it no longer held a charge I bought another one. This one didn't even last as long as the first. They start out great, you can do almost the entire house on a charge but soon you barely get one room done before it dies. I should not have wasted my money. I am back to using a good old fashioned broom to clean the kitchen floor."
1,not worth the money,"I have eureka ""the boss"" and bought this product by mistake. it's like a dusbuster; doesn't pick up anything."
3,Every step was a pleasure in this transaction.,This was a replacement of the same model which had given many years of good service. The service you rendered in the selling process was highly professional and pleasing. I was so happy with the product and service that I bought two more of them.
1,Eureka 96 B Quick Up Upright Cordless Stick vacuum,The product worked well for about 5 months then the batteries would no longer hold a charge. It was a waste of money.
4,Great for quick clean ups.,"I use this for my truck, my wood kitchen floors, and the stairs. Very light and easy to maneuver. My wife loves it for the stairs... she can quickly go from the floor to the steps by removing the long handle in no time at all. Great for cleaning up my dog's (black lab) hair."
4,Does one thing well,"I've tried a few stick vacuums, but found this one to do the best job for ""touch up"" cleanings. It does a good job on hardwood floors and a reasonable job on carpet, even getting edges and corners fairly well. It does need emptying often to maintain it's suction, and it is a bit cumbersome to use as a hand vac, but it beats Dirt Devil hands down."
4,all but cherrios,this does a good job. it does not pick up cherrios. just blows them around. Does not hold a charge along time bt it is enough for the jobs it was intended for.
2,Barely acceptable,This is really quite a bad cordless vacuum.It has almost no suction (those that write that it does have not really tested it).1. Turn it to floor mode.2. Put your hand at the nozzle. You will feel nearly nothing.3. Put down some white powder carpet freshner.4. Turn the boss to carpet mode.5. See how long it takes to remove the white powder.6. Run another vacuum across the same area.You will prove to yourself that this picks up only the minimal amount of the powder with mutliple passes required at that.Not recommended.
3,Good for small jobs but not perfect,"My family has owned three cordless stick vacs (Electrolux, Eureka and Hoover brands) and the Electrolux Pronto is the best. The Hoover was light and had great mobility but suction was poor, not much better than a carpet sweeper. Eureka had much better suction and good battery life but could not fit into tight places. Electrolux Pronto has the best of everything with good suction, enough battery life to sweep up one floor of our house. The best feature is the removable hand vac - we can clean up between our couch cusions or along floor trim. We have two kids (3y.o. and 1y.o.) and this keeps all the crumbs and hair off the floor, we use it at least once per day. We bring out the canister vac for whole-house cleaning but the Electrolux Pronto cordless helps us keep the house neat on a day to day basis."
1,Broken within 5 mins,"The suction setting stopped working within 5 minutes of operation. Had to return it back to Amazon. Although the price is good, it's not worth the hassle."
5,the best cordless vacuum on the market,"I have ordered 5 of these vacuums & given them to friends, who liked them so much they went online & purchased more. They are very handy."
2,Not as good as indicated in other reviews,I have a hand held vacuum and it has more suction than this vacuum. I would return it now if I could. Not good on hardwood as advertised.
4,Eureka cordless,"I liked the Eureka because it is very light weight. The filter has to be cleaned often, however. Overall it is a great somevacuum."
1,Awful vacuum!,"If I could give this product less than one star I would. It arrived with no suction, my husband fixed it and, less than a day later, it stopped working correctly again. The fan inside keeps slipping off the post. Poorly made, and not worth getting it repaired. I will stick to my Roomba!"
3,Quiet but poor Design,"We'll all be better off when women start designing vacuum cleaners. This was clearly designed by a man. Trying to flip open the catch to empty the nondisposable bagless cup takes strength and is a terrible design. Once open you think the dirt would be inside the cup itself; it is actually the filter and you have to lift out the filter and then empty the cup. Trying to put back the filter with its rubber seal and close the vacuum tightly is a chore. It took me longer to empty the vacuum than to vacuum and then the dirt fuzz sticks to the filter so you have to brush it off somehow with your hand.It does miss small stones; but it does a good job of getting loose dirt out of grouting between tiles, something my broom doesn't do.Needs a crevice tool. Charge doesn't last too long, about 15-20 minutes. Think twice before spending close to $40 by time taxes and shipping are added."
3,"Does the job, not spectacular","I bought this vacuum after deciding that I didn't want to spend $50 + shipping to get a new battery for my Roomba. The Eureka is okay. Lightweight, yes, so that's good. But do note: this version purchased at Sears does not include an extra battery pack as some of the other reviewers mentioned, so that was a bit of a disappointment.It is adequate for a quick clean-up, which is what it is intended for. However, when it comes to random bits of cat litter, I had to go over a couple of pieces several times to finally pick them up.It was great in the bathroom to quickly clean up stray hairs left behind by 3 people and 3 cats!My husband does not think the battery will last all that long and we'll end up buying a new one in the not too distant future. Can't say for sure, but will update once we get to that point."
4,Great short read,"This is a fantastic book written by one of the greatest authors of the 20th century. Heinrich Böll was the first German author to win the Nobel Prize for literature since Thomas Mann in 1929. This short story follows the tale of Katharina Blum, and unlike most books, starts at the end, and works its way back. A great read that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I highly recommend this book."
2,I am not a fan of Heinrich Böll,This novel has the form of a police report. As usual with Heinrich Böll the subject matter is a confused mixture of religion (Catholic christianity) and left wing politics. The novel is apparently inspired by the political terrorism of the Red Army Faction in the 1970's Western Germany.
5,Worth every dollar!,"The ""Lain"" series is a must for the diehard japanimation collector. Not only is the animation beautiful and the copy quality excellent but the audio is also exceptional. The story is surreal and takes a while to understand but that is part of the fun! This is a series that really gets the old brain working overtime and leaves more than enough for the eyes to enjoy. I can't suggest it enough."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book I believe in 2005 to prepare for the exam. The subject matter is good, but there are so many incorrect spellings throughout the book that I could not believe that I had paid $60 for it. I paid half the price for the exam book from the Research & Education Asso and I passed both exams. Who edited this study guide was my question? I wanted to get my money back, but I didn't and I should have. Also it did not help me pass the test at all, so I gave up on reading it. So future teachers do not purchase this book. You will not pass. It is a rip-off and not worth the money!"
5,Excellent Resource!!,"I have used this book so many times with my third graders. Heard has some fresh, creative ideas on the different types of revisions that come up in Writers Workshop. If you love writers workshop this is a great addition to your library!"
3,Lent if for Children,"This book is better for the middle age students, as opposed to the younger children in school. It is loaded with a blend of prayers and activities and can be altered to suit the needs of the classroom. I would advise purchasing it as a reference book for the classroom during the season of Lent."
4,Good Product,"These ping pong balls have lasted us a while now. They are as they advertise. I'd say they are a little thicker than the average ping pong ball, but good quality."
1,Toxic ingredients! BAD book! BAD!,"Lots of people-food-look-alikes with cutesy names (Poodle Noodles) instead of useful, tasty treats to pop in a pocket for canine rewards later. Worst of all, at least four recipes feature raisins, an ingredient TOXIC to dogs! Don't take my word for it, read about it at the aspca website. [...]"
4,Not bad...but....,"I really enjoyed this book, and so did my dog. I bake from it quite a bit and he really enjoys it. I think his favorite was the birthday cake, which he had for his first birthday. The reason I give it 4 stars is this: as doggie ""chefs"", the authors of this book should have known better than to use raisins in 3 of their recipes. It is common dog owner knowledge that raisins can sometimes cause kidney failure! I was very surprised to see that ingredient in their recipes. At least they didn't include onions in their recipes, as I have seen in other dog cookbooks."
2,Many Recipies Impractical,"I found many of the recipies to be impractical, due to large serving sizes. In addition, some recipies include corn meal, an ingredient that I associate with cheap dog food and food allergies."
1,Terrible,"You know, I want my kids to learn all the traditional hymn worship songs, and I thought this might be the album to do it. Well, let me tell you. It sounds like some funeral home organist and some strange woman who thinks she can sing got together and made an album. It's truly awful. I actually deleted it from my music library, it was that scary. Drum machine plus organ with lots of swell, plus out-of-their-range singers equals awful, awful music. I'm sure they tried, but they shouldn't have."
2,Not the best...,"For PC editing, this is a fairly good program. However, I prefer Final Cut Pro a million times over Sony Vegas. The interface is much friendlier and the program has much much more capability that Vegas does."
4,The Agony of the Civil War and the Aftermath,"It is a story about what individual people went through in Franklin Tennessee before, during and after the battle. It reminds you of what that period in history was like with no modern medicine or communication. It opens your eyes that many of the Union and Confederate soldiers were kids who knew nothing of fighting a war. They just did their best with practically no training but with the belief that their cause was worth it.The story is touching, moving and tragic. I became so fond of the characters and emotionally was pulling for them even when the odds were against them. The writer holds you, then in the end, leaves you with a huge sense of respect and awareness of what both sides went through and you pray to God it can never happen in this country again."
3,Quite a few errors...,"I'm only through Chapter 1 of this book and have already found a few errors. For example, page 16 states that the Flash multi-button (figure 1.4) causes the built-in electronic flash to pop-up. Not true - depends on your mode dial settings! Same with the Exposure compensation button. Plus a photo caption in the early pages describes a different lens.Seems like the author copied and pasted a lot of the contents of this book from his D70 field guide... Still, a good value for the money."
2,Trouble for me,"Well made, good price. Excellent product if you only use LCD screen, and I recommend it for that. However,cumbersome to use if you use camera viewfinder for your shots - which I do. Open then close then open, etc.. //don"
1,I feel taken advantage of.,"Does this product do what it's suppose to, maybe; but I feel as if a quick touch of a grounded object would suffice. After hooking this product up to work on internal components of my computers, I found it in the way and what seemed like overkill. As little as I used the item, I found it to be a waste of money. When later working on my computer and walking across carpet, I just touched something metal and didn't have any issues with static.... In fact, just drop me a line and I'll send you mine. It's in the original package and seemingly brand new :)"
5,My Library,"My interest in genealogy has taken me back in time to a wife without a name(unknown). With no marriage records, no land records, no wills, just a brick wall. But I long to get to know my ancestress. This book from Amazon and several more from them about the Cherokee people have given me a window to catch a glimpse of this part of my ancestry."
1,Sam's Teach Yourself Basic 6 in 10 Minutes,I am of the opinion that the publisher should pay the reader to use this book. It is so vague it's rediculous. There is no explanation for the novice at all and there is nothing to learn without being somewhat of a vb programmer already; so why buy the book? SAVE YOR MONEY!
4,High Energy Jazz Goes Pop!,"This must have been Sonny Sharrock's attempt at a crossover instrumental-rock hit -- and it actually works pretty well. While the rhythm section (including the synth) is pretty basic, Sharrock's guitar is as powerful as ever and his choice of tunes (and arrangements) is creative to say the least: from the West-African ""Highlife"" to the traditional gospel ""All My Trials"" (done as an uptempo dance!) and Pharoah Sanders' ""Venus/Upper Egypt"" (from the late 60's classic ""Tauhid"", Sharrock's recording debut). Recommended for Sharrock fans and for anyone with an ear for powerful, intelligent electric guitar."
5,A must read for any civil war fans!,"I really liked this book. You really can understand how the soldiers felt and how camp and battle life was for them. I learned a little about the civil war from this, too. This book has action, emotion and laughter all rolled into one. If you know every thing about the civil war or u know nothing, this is a good book. It sits on my 'Favorite Shelf' this second. A good read."
2,"come on, invader zim?","well the girls at my school like this show but i personally don't like it, because they are starting to act like that gir character, and i mean come on, a dog that is a robot? i would not recommend this to children."
1,...very dissapointing...,"I will tell you this: Invader Zim deserved to be cancelled. It is a terrible show that just watches Zim or Gir get mad. I am quite getting sick of people whining over a stupid show that got cancelled. I mean, obviously no one cared to see it if it NEVER gets chosen on Nickelodeon.It would have been on Adult Swim instead. It's almost, if not as bad, as Rocket Power.In a nutshell, this show is disgusting."
1,Definitely not for kids,"I think that Gir character is cute and funny, although some parts of this show were scary even for me. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 10, unless they want to have nightmares."
2,ok,ok nickelodeon has got great cartoons i love BUT this is the worst BOOOOOOOO!!!!!! its so werid a stupid robot dressed up like a dog and a green alien the robots suit is soooooooo dumb but its not nickelodoeons fault BUT this still stinks.
5,super awesome,There is not one song on this album that isn't good! It keeps me bouncing while I drive. In constant rotation in my cd player :)
5,New and Unique,"I saw Margot and the Nuclear So and So's live the first time I ever heard them. I love there sound, though I will say they are better live. They have a ton of different instruments involved and they are much more vibrant live. I still love the CD, I am afraid I am going to wear it out actually, and then have to buy a new one. My advice: If you like music that isn't the same old stuff over and over again (*cough* Radio *cough*) def. get the CD, but if you ever have a chance to see them live, don't miss out. They are on Myspace if you want to look to see when their shows are."
4,Hard-to-find size,"I'm using these for some large (1.5"" pipes) around my home - I could only find smaller (inside dimension) sizes at my local hardware store. Pricey, but they're working as intended."
3,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this bracelet this morning. It was to be a gift for my mother, but in my opinion it looks quite cheap. No where near the value of the sale price, let alone the original price. I will be returning it."
4,Hated The Class but it was Sinchy,This class is required for any gen-ed program before you go into your major (or at least a class similar to this at every school). Really easy but most of this stuff is so obvious
1,Don't waste your time,"There are MANY better collections of wedding music out there, and I'm sorry that I wasted my money on this one."
2,not that great..,"I was mildly dissappointed in this CD....I wouldnt purchase this CD, There has to be better CD's out there! Yes, lots of selection, but still not worth it!"
4,A MAN OF HIS TIME AND PLACE,"I had heard from my parents about a international playboy named ""Rubi"" who I now learn was Portiro Rubirosa of the Dominican Republic. He loved the ladies and they in turn loved him and many married him (ones with money). I liked Shawn Levy's writing - smooth, interesting and flows like a storyteller in your backyard. Rubi lived hard playing polo, night-clubbing to dawn, traveling the world over, and finally ended it all at age 56 when he killed himself in a sports car accident. He was a memorable product of his time and place, and now-a-days would be hounded by tabloids and photographers but that might be okay, he did love the glitz and gossip...and the wealthy women."
3,Biographies,"This was ok, quick read. Not as good as i thought it would be.But everyone has different opinons about biographies."
3,Not how I remember it,"This ""Nevsky"" was much beloved by me and my classical music loving friends when it appeared as an LP about 45 years ago and I do remember it being a lot more exciting. On this Vanguard CD the conducting seems tame, the chorus less powerful than on other recordings--all in all a disappointment. The ""Kiji"" suite that follows is good but still a little pallid up against much of the competitive issues. I love the notes, however, and some of you might want to own this set to renew some old memories of the wonderyears of the LP when there simply were not that many recordings of each of our favorites to make comparisons."
5,beautiful Christmas book,"This is a lovely book, with great illustrations that children and adults enjoy! A sweet story! Really worth having."
2,Slow delivery & restocking fee,"The ornament is cute & looks just like the picture. The description says 2- 3"" Ceramic Pig Ornament and shows 2 ornaments in the picture, but I only received one so I felt the item description was very misleading. I placed the order 2 weeks before a Christmas gift exchange and did not receive the shipment in time for the exchange so I had to return it. The company charges a 15% restocking fee for returns from orders placed through Amazon so you may want to consider this when ordering."
4,westin driving lights,Very nice lights and wiring kit for the cost. Only wish they had chrome housings instead of black.
1,Views of Christianity,"I thought about becoming a Christian Psychologist when I first began my college years. My Father informed me that, who am I to charge money for something that is free? I gave up my career goals and have been skeptical ever since of anyone that charges money for biblical advice. It's free!!!!!!!!!"
4,For the thinking Catholic,The Catholic faith requires study in order to understand it. Peter Kreeft looks at both sides of every argument. This book is invaluable to any Catholic who wants to understand his faith.
3,Handbook of Christian Apologetics,a little hard to understand in places.......guess I am not a theologian.....but it is a good book..... and in places makes God's Word very clear......
4,Easy and Fun Scanner,Just the best scanner I could have bought for me.It is easy and delivers information to the computer screen that I can understand and use.The help function is very clear and simple.The only problem I had with this scanner is that it does not recognise AOL's browser so the E-mail function on the scanner will not work with my internet provider. Not a big problem.The photo program built in to the scanner is really functional and very easy to use.Just the BEST !!!!!Really do recommend this.
5,SCANNER for a NOVICE,"I had no trouble learning to use this product. It was easy to understand and I've been able to scan beautiful pictures, sharing them with family and friends."
5,KLH Rules!!,"These speakers are the best audio buy I have ever made!! If you like your music vibrant and detailed then try a pair of KLH 18BHG and you will be blown away, I know I was!! Thanka to Amazon and KLH true high quality and low price is reality!!"
1,Copyright infringement case waiting to happen,"Not quite as original as I'd hoped. Most of the ""Jesus"" character seems to be very closely based around the Egyptian sun god, Horus. I mean, seriously Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, could you not come up with anything new at all? The whole virgin birth, walking on water, healing the sick, persecution, resurrection(after three days, just like Horus), and ascendancy were all taken DIRECTLY from Egyptian mythology! Are you guys even trying? I know plagiarism is the highest form of flattery, but you gentlemen are a bit much! Also: anyone who actually believes in this toilet tissue collection, please, don't vote."
1,Professional Editing makes ALL the difference,"What we have here is a collection of cute stories (naked couple talking to snakes, father sacrificing his son, man swallowed by whale, grandpa builds a boat, etc) completely mixed up with long census reports, a metric crap-ton of genealogy, and a strange collection of passages condemning everything from poly-cotton blends to facial shaving.The central premise of the first half of the book(the relationship of the cleverly named sky-god 'God' and the hebrews) changes drastically in the second half, when God impregnates a teenager with himself and begins waxing philosophic about lilies and fish and sheep and camels and needles.Loooooooong story short; some good ideas (and a REALLY sexy little section in Song of Solomon) (I mean, that crap is HOT) but terribly written with serious continuity problems."
5,Hilarious! First rate comedy.,"Forget Larry The Cable Guy's new movie, or any contemporary comedy for that matter. This is where the real humor is at."
2,A poor attempt at fiction,"I've heard a lot about this book so I got. I was, sadly let down. It was long, dull, and very, very, very preachy (often contridictin itself). It starts off quick enough, though the plot is laughable, but quickly disolves into a poor colection of poorly written short stories. Some are better than others though. The main character, Jesus Christian, doesn't come in till late in the story so way too much build up to it. He is great character but the author's instistance to put into such obserd situation ( lepers? come on!?!?) But still a nice plot twist twords the end give it some spice which is completely earased by, get this, the end of the world. Stupid huh? All in this book has the makings of a good story but the author was just trying way to hard. If it hadn't been so long and have had such a ridiculous plot. I hope there's a sequel because there's a lot of promise ( and a hint of the return of Jesus)"
1,"Meh, no cited sources","This book claims its a work of non-fiction yet it is lacking in its citations. It is very hard to to believe the author's claim that the book is based on fact. Mentioning the author, I cant seem to find him either. If I turned in a piece of work like this into one of my professors, they would probably laugh at me and tell me to get my head out of the clouds and work on something more realistic, like bigfoot."
1,What,Well let me first of all I would like to tell you why I have gave it one star. 1st of all I don't know why you think this is real first of all. Yes I have read this and I found this to be the biggest bed time store I have ever laid my eyes on. You have to be the most gulble person in the world to blive that some men wrote this thing 1000 plus years ago and now we have it now. Incuase you didn't know if something was writen that long ago don't you think things got added in there first of all. 2nd of all this can never make man fill whole the only thing that does is the left hand path aka Satanism. I know what most of all you think it's the work of devil inside me etc etc. You know what I can set straght about the left hand path if you e mail me. All will hail satan in one way or another also hail theyself
1,Fake,"This book is a fake, if you want to know the truth read this:The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"
2,:.:,"KJV is not a bad format, depending on the apporach you decide to take to Bible. If it is for faith affirmation, go ahead, surround yourself with inauthentic, incorrect, archaic thous and shalts of KJV. If uncovering the deep metaphoric layers is what you want, abandon this pompous stupidity at all costs. Incorrect translations and all to big liberty-takings destroy what literary value this book has. Look elsewhere if your aim is to study mythology and metaphor in the book."
5,Versatile rhythm tool...,The LP soft shake is a lot of bang for the buck. It is very versatile. You can make a lot of different sounds with it. Five stars!
2,"Too namy problems, even at this price.","I bought this printer from Amazon.com two years ago. Things were fine at first; installation was easy and print quality was good.The first problems arose when I tried to connect it with its USB port. The issue was solved through Xerox's website, but periodic crashes and lockups are the norm now.Over time, print quality has deteriorated dramatically. I've experienced printhead and ink clogging/drying problems that have put me in the market for a new printer.I bought the M750 because it was relatively inexpensive and looked like it would remain [inexpensive] to operate since ink cartridges could be replaced individually by color. The short, two-year lifetime doesn't seem very cost-effective now."
1,"Xerox ""quality?""","This is the most pitiful excuse for a printer I can imagine.At first it turned out fairly good quality, and fast output---but in short order it quit feeding paper, no matter what steps I took. FAQ at Xerox troubleshooting site recommends you ""fan"" the paper---that doesn't work. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, looked for newer drivers...checked for jams....added, subtracted paper --and finally give up. A printer, despite it's low cost, should be one of those items that HELPS a home/office---not causes additional grief. Never, again, Xerox."
3,Does not support Post Script,This printer is good value for its price. Its B/W print quality is very good. Color print quality is also pretty good. Its a good printer for home or home/office. However this printer does not support Post Script. So you won't be able to print Acrobat pdf files.
5,HARDHOUSE FOR THE HOUSE HEADS,"I JUST WANT 2 SAY THAT THIS CD IS TIGHT. WHEN DJ LARRY LYNX IS IN THE MIX HE JUST KEEPS ON TERING IT UP ON THE TT`S.THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL THE HOUSE HEADS,BREAK BEAT JUNKIES,DRUM & BASS PURIST, HARDHOUSE PEOPLE AND ALL THE RAVERS ACROSS AMERICA, THIS IS HOUSEPARK VOLUME 1"
1,I bought this and returned it two days later,"I encourage you to ""see all readers reviews"" and read the one from Silicon Valley. I was going to review it myself, but can't add to what's been said before. This isn't research, it's adolescent dithering. Fannish chat group afficionados may call it scholarly research, which shows you how much scholarly research they've read, or done. As glorious as The Lord of the Rings is, it's literature; it isn't history. To pretend it is history is to do it, and its author, a great disservice."
2,unhappy with verizon treo 755p,"Even though i pay verizon for unlimited text, picture and video messaging, i can't use picture and video messaging unless i also pay for internet access. The 755p uses the internet for picture and video messaging but doesn't always disconnect from the internet running up KB usage and charges. Either i have to block the internet which also blocks picture and video messaging or pay for both the messages and the internet. Phone also freezes when looking for a cellular signal-can't use the calendar and contacts while it is searching for a signal, such as inside a building."
3,Lots of facts,"This books tells you a lot about what John D. Rockefeller did and did not do in his life, his family and and associates, his philanthropy.The writing is very dry, not easy or pleasant to follow."
4,"If you love philanthropists, this is the book for you!!","When John D. Rockefeller was a young immigrant, he never knew he would be a successful oil tycoon. To start with, John D. Rockefeller had Alopecia Areata, a not too uncommon disease. He loved people. He never did anything he thought his customers would not like. He didn't work for himself, but for his people. In his 98-year life, he had three children. None of his children went into the oil business after him, not because they didn't respect their father's work, but because they did not want to screw up the idea that their father had started. John Rockefeller was a true American hero and helped shaped the way we run our country today. During the industrial revolution, Rockefellers ideals on humanitarianism were well respected and it is a shame there aren't more businesspeople like him today."
3,A lot of content,"A good book if you are a history buff. For lighter reading, this would not be the right book."
1,Save your money,"Don't be fooled by the title. There is precious little in this book that will be of use for the no budget independent filmmaker. If you want a truly useful and comprehensive guide on low budget independent moviemaking then I recommend ""Digital Filmmaking 101"" by Dale Newton and John Gaspard. The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook will be worthless to you unless you have a budget of a million dollars or more. Skip it."
3,1995 Tight 2000 Ok,I think I.M.x is a pretty good group but they need to make more slow songs than fast.But Stay the night was a ok song . But they was more talented back in 1995.And Marcus your still my favorite I hope yall come back to A.T.X.
5,great buy,"This mic is awesome, its not the first time i purchase it. Our company was so happy with it we decided to purchase more."
2,Curtiss is underrated,"Its probably true the Glenn Curtiss is underrated in aviation history. However, this story would have been more effective if the author could have demonstrated this without disparaging the Wrights. When he overstates the importance of Curtiss achievements (first public flight in the US, issuance of the first US pilot's license), and underrates the achievements of the Wrights, he loses credibility.Consider whether Curtiss would have had any place in aviation history without the prior work of the Wrights. Seems very doubtful."
5,great even for those who can't read,"My 19 month old loves this book (and has for the last three months with unwavering interest.) The words and pictures are so engaging. I sometimes read it to him three times in a row. He loves to identify all the people, things, and animals throughout the story. The illustrations are superb. We wish that there were more stories out there about Raymond. He's so likable!"
4,"Nice keyboard, confusing UI","The combination of short+wide and tall+narrow keys is great. The biggest problem is that some of the functions I use often are hard to find, and there's no way to make shortcuts to them. It also seems like it should do 3d graphing, but doesn't, and having to pay extra for the pc/mac version of the same software that's on the calculator is obnoxious."
3,Its fairly good,I have It lot cheaper than full Price I am satisfied with the machine. But two of the batteries in it was corroded and had to be replaced. The service was swift and reliableThank you
5,The Best Graphing Calculator +,"I've been teaching for over 10 years and have used the TI-82,83,84, and 89 in my math and science classrooms. Finally, there is an upgradable learning tool that has better resolution and dynamic linking capabilities that is perfect for every high school (and beyond) math class, INCLUDING geometry. I could go on for some time about all the things that I like about it, but space doesn't allow. Clearly, the first and possibly favorite feature students will notice is that the input actually looks like the mathematics in the textbook. It has ""pretty print"" on the input as well as the announcement. ""Parentheses errors"" will become a thing of the past; no more getting the wrong answer because you entered it in wrong."
3,Not for NY state students,"Do not purchase this calculator if you are a NY state high school student planning to use it on the Regents test - this model is not allowed. Also, this model does NOT have an interchangeable key pad, therefore, the Touch Keypad that is recommended with it can not be used on this model."
1,Ye olde programmed software crash,"I had long loved my TI-85, but it finally met it's doom after going thru three highschool careers between me and the kids. I bought the CAS as a replacement and felt comfortable immediately with the calculator. After a few months the software mysteriously erased itself (no OS installed), so I worked on reinstalling. The only issue is that you must purchase additional software from TI and they could not care less about your device that crashed and that you already paid for it.It's sad a calculator company can't continue their use of stable software and after it fails won't back it up."
5,Driger F: the best blade,The Driger F is pure power. I haven't seen much of a better blade. It has a metal bottom so be careful. It also has an auto clutch so it will switch from attack to endurence before your eyes. It is rated the best blade made. I have battled my nextdoor neighbor and i can't beat his Master Dragoon. Please post it here if you have a good combo to beat it. I also have Dragoon F and Master Draceil. Thank You.
4,Woah.,"This here is a great blade. It's like a Draciel and a Dragoon combined. It can withstand a strike from a full speed Dragoon Fighter at times! When I don't use Dragoon, I use this one. Buy it. It is truely worth the money."
5,driger F kills all,"Many people think master driger is better than driger F.... theyre stupid. I used Driger F without customizations and it beat all of my beyblades ( Draciel, Dranzer F, Kid Dragoon, Seaborg 2, and Master Driger) When i added an 8 balance weight disk it cracked a part off Master drigers attack ring and its bit chip went flying. If any 1 wants to challenge me go to the beyblade east coast tournament in NYC. NYC rocks. best city in the UNIVERSE and BEYOND"
1,Does not work,"It only functions on the volume buttons, but sometimes volume up bring the volume down, and sometimes they don;t work at all. 2008 VW R32"
3,steering wheel control,this works good. the only complaint I could have is it has a delay to get it to work.......
1,Cheap plastic junk!,"I thought from the photo and description that this was Diecast METAL. Instead, it is an injection molded toy. I gave this to a business associate thinking that it would be an interesting office piece. Instead, I insulted him with this junk. Amazon must screen the descriptions better before letting third parties deceive their customers.I give it 0 stars."
4,good enough for me,"While I completely understand where everyone is coming from about some of the songs, I feel that this was a good album. Of course I listened to it without comparing it to U2. When you compare to U2 of course it's not gonna be as good, but standing on its own I enjoyed this cd. It was not good enough for a five but that is because they didn't quite give some of the U2 covers justice. My favorite song was ""Sunday bloody Sunday"" but that's just me. It seemed that my taste was different than some of the reviewers I thought that ""When love comes to town"" was pretty good, but they had a point in saying it didn't do justice to U2."
1,Not better than the Real Thing,"I've listened to the clips here. I have to say that a couple of the tracks might bear listening to the whole thing (Sixpence or jars, perhaps). but most of the versions of U2 songs seem derivative. If you're going to cover a song, you need to make it your own; most of the tracks here are still owned by U2. They're not generally horrible -- they're just not very good. If I had the choice to listen to this or to listen to the Real Thing, I'd go with the latter. Save your money and buy an album actually by U2. You won't be disappointed. Try Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, or All That You Can't Leave Behind."
1,Totally inadequate illustrations,This book is complete with pretty but inadequate illustrations. They are so bad it is totally impossible to tell what the author is talking about. He should take a lesson from cookbook authors who are able to put themselves in the position of the eager=to-learn reader.
4,Good Introduction Book,"This book is very simple to understand, I think it's a great introductory book for a beginner."
5,When You 'Kneed' To Hold Firm!,"I used the Knee Immobilizer after having my knee cap lowered 50% and moved laterally 25%. It does indeed immobilize! Although there are quite a few straps, which I first thought a nuisance, I soon realized they allowed me to easily adjust my comfort level in varying degrees during each stage of my recovery. I wore it just to be on the safe side when I was able to get out of the wheelchair and use my Guardian Extra-Duty Folding Walker to manuever outside. ~ Mrs. B."
5,So far so good!,This is the OEM SP installed in my 01 Sentra SE and at 140k miles it is time to replace them. After seeing the gaps on the original plugs I am thinking I should have replaced them at the 80k mile mark. In terms of longevity I highly recommend it.
1,Protect a bub twin sunshade,I would NOT recommend this product - it's a piece of fabric with short ties which you attach to the stroller - just flops down over the kids faces - useless!
2,Not Recommended for exam preparation,The sample questions at the end of chapters and the exam prep questions on CD are NOTHING like the actual exams. They provide no help. I found numerous factual errors in these books. Many questions on the real exam could not be answered even using the book as a reference. Do not count on these books as your primary study guide or source of information.
2,Returned - defective,"The bottom brackets depend on a small tab that sticks out to hold them in once inserted. Unfortunately mine was defective and would not stay in. Poor quality control, poor execution, poor design. I knew I was going cheap but I hoped it would work. I have another stand from OnStage that has the same design and works fine. So it's hit or miss."
3,No directions? No interior Box?,I'm sure this stand is fine .. based on the reviews -- that's what I'm counting on when I purchased it as a gift for my husband. Today I opened the exterior box in order to wrap it and inside found a bunch of metal pieces (one poking through the plastic) -- no directions -- no brand information or anything. Literally a bunch of metal in a plastic bag. You can't even tell what this is based on that.. Merry Christmas -- guess what I got you? I'm really disappointed in the packaging on this.
4,Great toy for the stroller,"I got this toy because it lit up and played music. The toy needs more lights and the music is not really all that great but the colors and things sticking off of the toy keep my son entertained in the store while in the stroller. He will play with all the things sticking off of it while we shop and it keeps his attention for awhile. I like that the toy has a velcro band on it to attach it to the stroller strap. This keeps it attached and not on the floor, since he likes to throw his toys now. He really likes the blue teether on the toy. I bought it for the lights and music so I am kind of disappointed about that part because it only has 2 dim lights and one song, but my son likes it anyway so I guess that makes it a good toy."
3,pricey.,"Louis Armstrong was such an amazing personality that a separate book could easily be dedicated to each stage of his life. However, this is a good read - especially about his younger years. After that it rushes a bit and also is a somewhat clinical, by-the-numbers account of his life. It seemed to me that the author wasn't really emotionally invested in a larger than life subject that calls for such. Also at 17 bucks it's too expensive."
5,WOW!!,"This book was amazingly well written! It wonderfuly portrays the life of a very talented and amzing man. Please, for your own sake, read this book!"
5,Excellent Book !!!!!!!,"After reading ""Prarie Rose"", ""Prarie Fire"" and ""Prairie Storm"" I am able to say that Catherine Palmer is a very talented and blessed writer. It seems to me that she had a divine inspiration while writing those romances, because it touchs your heart in a very impressive way. Excellent!!!Prairie Storm is set in Hope and tells the beautiful love story of Lily and Eli.She is a lovely widow that knows everything about the Bible and religion but don't know God and Eli is a young preacher that is learning to be a shepherd.The book is a page-turner and extremely enjoyable. Fans of historical romances with happy ends will simply love Prairie Storm. I loved it."
3,Sergio Mendez does Brazil,"I was a fan of Sergio Mendez since his trio days, then Brazil 65, 66, etc.So, I would say this CD is for his fans or those who want an anthology of Brazilian music.The CD is essentially a collection of different Brazilian music forms. Personally, I rather missed his usual jazzy, Bossa Nova, or Samba style on the CD."
5,Great Party Music,"This music is irresistable. If you grew up more concerned about the crease in your kakis and the cut of the crystal you serve, if you are over-educated and over-paid (even though you complain about the opposite), this is the medicine you need to awaken to what life is reallly about. Hopefully you're tired of lying on your psychaitrist's couch or with your psychiatrist under it. Maybe you've tried wheat grass juice bars and read the great works of modern thinking like the Celestine Prophecy and still nothing has touched your soul the way you long to be touched. Well, Sergio Mendes, long known as a sort of shlock artist himself, has recouperated on this disk and pounds out some tunes that are guaranteed to shake your booty, make you shake your body. You cannot not dance and be alive with this stuff playing. So if you buy it and don't start dancing, proceed immediately to the morgue and may you rest in peace."
1,not happy,"i bought iOSAT Potassium Iodide Tablets, 130 mg (14 Tablets) the product didnot ship on time 2 weeks later .i emailed and they didnot respond .i had to go through amozon to get a responce .....wouldnot recomend"
1,Buyer Beware,Do not buy this product from SMART-CART. They sold me an expired product and tried to rub off the expiration date in an attempt to conceal this fact. Save yourself some trouble and do not support this behavior.
4,Shipped promptly in perfect shape,I Hope I dont ever have to use them. But if I do and I survive I will change the rating to 5 stars.
5,2019 Expiration Date,"I was happy to see that the expiration date was a generaous 2019---and I am sure that they will still be good for some time after. The item arrived in good time, and was as stated."
1,Why put the list of contents on the outside og a package?,"Shipped fast in a standard envelope but using a printout address label of the order with contents listed is wrong on several levels. An email from the company equating this to a purchase made at the Gap (you can't make this up) and is ""standard practice"" is teason for me to shop elsewhere."
5,Hope it works!,Hasn't been a chance to use it but I know this stuff will work. Came in fast and this stuff is legit.
4,"Product fine, packaging not so much.","It's the product everyone should have in their survival kits. However, this is shipped in a regular envelope with no padding, exactly as you see in the main picture. The envelop was pretty beat up and I can imagine that many get destroyed by USPS's automated systems."
1,A collection of the most boring Dr. Hook songs,"Dr. Hook was truly the greatest band. They had so many amazing songs, mainly written by Shel Silverstein such as ""Freaking at the Freakers Ball"", ""On The Cover of the Rolling Stone"", ""Get My Rocks off"" (currently covered by Marilyn Manson on his latest release) and ""I got stoned and I missed it"". The ""Love songs album"" is a collection of the more boring Dr. Hook songs. Bye the way, watch out for false marketing! Two of the songs from this ""Love songs album"" have been re-released on Dennis Locorriere's ""new"" CD ""Out of the Dark"" by the record label ""Track"" in February 2000. Thirteen other songs on this ""new"" album is from Dennis Locorriere's 1996 album ""Running with Scissors"". This is not mentioned on the CD."
2,Bad hardware,"The bolt that holds the transducer to the mounting bracket locked up before it got tight, broke trying to back it off. the band/hose clamp twisted / stripped out before it got tight. I'm a GM technician with 17 years experience. these items weren't cross threaded the just failed. low quality!"
2,Not What I Thought,I did not know this was a Jimmy Swaggert and John Starnes CD. I would not have bought had I known this. If you don't like Jimmy rattling on don't buy this.
3,NOT THAT BAD,THE MOVIE WAS NOT THAT BAD THE PLOT WAS OK BUT IT COULD HAVEBEEN MUCH BETTER. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT WOMEN IN PRISON FACINGA CORRUPT WARDEN AND SECURITY GUARD. THE MOVIE COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT BETTER FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS JUST OK.
3,Two separate books - a comedy and a moral piece,"Part One is the amusing story of Chichikov's shifty scheme to make money by obtaining legal ownership of recently dead serfs whose names are still on the census, in order to somehow mortgage this property at a profit. To understand the scheme you would have to understand the relevant laws.To accomplish this purpose, Chichikov travels around Russia mixing with the best society and makes propositions to rich landowners. He is very good at flattery. Even so, things don't go smoothly for the scam artist.Part Two, written many years later, brings back Chichikov as he meets a miser who allows his estate to go to pot, and a model landowner who works very hard. The question we are left with is whether Chichikov will continue to be a shifty character or will clean up his act like the model landowner. I'm sure it was meant as a question for the reader as well."
5,great,Got this for my husband's birthday. He loved it. We only used it once but excited to use it more often.
5,Great Little Sushi Making Kit,"This kit is a great gift idea and a really good way to start making yer very own bonafide sushi -- both nigiri (rice ball) and maki (roll). All you need is an expert fish buyer, a knife that is sharp as h**l, and some itty bitty little bowls for soy sauce. Everything else is IN THE BOX. Sushi Chef brand soy sacue is the best soy sauce you ever had, IMHO.The little instruction booklet is great. Of course, this kit is no substitute for years of apprenticeship with a Tokyo master chef, but, if you have some appreciation for the aesthetic of sushi and a flare for D.I.Y. and access to sushi-grade fish, then this is the kit for you."
3,"ok kit, some components not so good","I would buy this again, with a caveat. Some of the parts of this kit were of poor quality. The Nori, seaweed for rolling, was of poor quality, brittle and broken and unusable. The instructions are adequate. The kit includes everything and is a good place to start. If it were not for a few poor quality parts, I would give it a 5 star. Use Saran wrap on your roller and life will be easier. Following instructions for rice came close to burning rice instructions not fully complete, limp recipes. I wanted something all in one to start out, and this provided it, found out some of the components were of poor or mediocre quality."
4,Sushi Kit,"Great product, very well presented in box. Bought it as a gift and the recepient loved it."
5,Great Product....Easy to Use!,"Kit contained everything needed to make sushi at hone except the fresh ingredients. Everything was good quality and the instructions were easy to use. Having never made sushi before, I was skeptical, but it was truly easy to use. You're paying a premium to have everything all bundled together vs buying everything seperately, but worth the cost for the simplicity."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I gave this product poor reviews because they do not allow returns and yet my product arrived damaged. The shipping box itself was in great condition, but the item must have been damaged before shipping. One corner was badly smashed in. Who did the quality control here? I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift for the holidays as is."
4,Sushi Chef Making Kit,A 4 star reading only for the fact that it hasn't been used yet. Its for a gift. Product arrived quickly as promised.
5,"Great fun, once you've cooked your rice","This kit is GREAT - all you need to learn how to make sushi (although I did find some good clips on youtube on how to make the rolls) - the rice takes ages to make, you have to wash it three times, cook it, then let it cool (fan it perhaps), then add the rice vinegar or whatever you have to add to it - and it is TOTALLY yummy - and all the other items are great. We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) - this is a really great kit. Used up all the nori last night, and will get some more, but this really is all you need to get started. Couldn't be happier and have recommended it to friends."
4,Worth the money.,Kit had everything needed minus vegetables and meat. Instructions were easy to follow and the final sushi tasted great!
4,"Great Kit, Maybe more recipes?","I was very happy when I received this kit. It comes with everything you need to start making sushi and is of very good quality. However, I wish that it would have included more recipes in the booklet and maybe some seasame seeds to go with it. (I can't find seasame seeds anywhere around these parts!) Overall, very pleased with this product."
3,The beginning of the end,"It doesn't matter whether this album was a commercial album or not. The Cure was brilliant in the 80s and the sorrow one feels at their current state is in reference to that former brilliance. This was the first Cure CD that I bought when I finally learned to like them, and now I can't even listen to the thing.Even though it has some great songs including ""Friday I'm in Love"" and ""Elise"" for the most part it's a dreary reworking of infinitely more brilliant songs. There are no songs that transcend the limitations like in the past. No ""Killing an Arab"", not even a ""Kiss Me. Kiss Me. Kiss Me.""After this CD, the Cure would be a washed out group just playing the same tired melodies over the same tired lyrics, without focus and without sincerity. The Cure of the 1980s was dark and depressing with flashes of danceable pop to make all the crap seem somehow worth it. The Cure of the 90s should have just given it up before this CD.But it's not a bad CD. It's just not a very good CD."
3,Has some good moments.,"I know that following up an album like Disintegration must not have been a simple task. While Wish is pretty decent overall, it still doesn't match up to the previous album. Wish doesn't sound as dark as Disintegration. I don't think that Wish is very experimental or groundbreaking either. On the whole, it sounds quite conventional and mellow. All of the tunes are listenable though: the best ones would be ""Friday I'm in Love,"" ""High,"" and ""Trust."" The keyboard work on ""Trust"" is nice and ""Friday I'm in Love"" shares the same uplifting and happy vibes as ""Just Like Heaven"" from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. Wish is a satisfying album, but there still aren't too many standouts. It does have some nice moments here and there. Worth a listen."
5,"*~Your ""WISH"" Come True~*","I love the cure- and this album was my favorite. Mixed-Up was great, but with ""wish"" the Cure gets focused and finds their sound. There's a little bit of everything in this album, and each song will appeal to a different mood- a different sky and emotion. You get some dark, and light and a lot in between. There's ""Friday I'm in love"" at one end of the scale- for the hopeful romantic with lots of energy and there's ""to wish impossible things"" at the other- for the heart- broken romantics that ache. There are so many emotions crammed into this album, so be ready for the rollercoaster. There's something for everyone- and for every afficionado: a ""wish"" come true. . . trust me~!"
4,A Cure For Pain,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said this album is more versatile. It is a beautiful album in every sense of the word. I haven't heard this album in some time, then on a drive home I listened to it with my girlfriend and I remembered all those times I spent alone with this album and how great it is! It has a little something for everyone. For those who love the Cure's ""pop"" side, there's ""High"" and ""Friday I'm In Love"" but I tend to prefer the Cure's emotional side. If you listen to ""Trust"" and ""To Wish Impossible Things"" and don't cry or feel any emotion, then you have a heart of stone. I also love ""A Letter To Elise"" and ""The Edge of the Deep Green Sea"" and of course the most underrated Cure track ""Doing The Unstuck"". I would recommend this album (along with the singles collections) to anyone who is just getting started listening to the Cure. I believe this is the easiest album from thiers to get into."
5,At once playful and wistful,"""Wish"" follows ""Disintegration"" like a bright spring day follows a sullen rainstorm. The songs on this album are well-worked Cure-isms that reflect love, loss, want, and the ever-present regret that Robert Smith does so exquisitely.If ""Disintegration"" comes across as a drizzly, moody set (complete with dark cover art), ""Wish"" is the breeze-blown, almost-calm sea that rolls through each tune (water is the closest element that can capture the essence of the Cure's sound). There's a nice mix of tight, snappy songs (""High,"" ""Friday I'm in Love"" and ""Perfect Day"") and more rambling stuff (""To Wish Impossible Things"" and ""Trust""), and the whole thing's not very long - a quality sometimes lacking in Cure albums.Listeners should also try the live CD ""Show"" for some ""Wish"" tracks; the band registers a very tight set."
5,The most amazing RPG ever created..,"This game has seriously changed the way i look at rpg's..It is a must have for any xbox 360 owner..great gameplay,amazing graphics and a very interesting story unlike any other out there."
2,"Overated, didnt like it","i bought this game with high expectations from everything i heard, and yes while the game does have depth it is also extremely boring and stretched out, not much fun to play, just time consuming"
3,Thats It?,"Mass Effect is a mediocre game at best. Offering retro visuals and soundtrack (circa Logan's Run), it is uniquely stylish and cool. The problem is that the style gets old and you realize the graphics are really, really outdated. The physics engine is just plain silly.The primary storyline is fun and entertaining, but a little short. The outline of the story is brilliant, but the way it is told is dumbed down for Saturday morning cartoons. While playing the game, I did a lot of the side quests (which get very boring, very quickly) as I was under the impression I needed to gear up for some great free-form adventure, ala Oblivion in space. This is NOT the case.Overall, this game offers some unique elements and given another 6-8 months in development it could have been one of the great games of all time. As it is, this game doesn't even make the top five games of the year. Lets hope the second release in the franchise gets the time it deserves."
3,Good Game,I'm a big fan of mass effect.. I played mass effect 2 before i bought the first and right before I bought the third.. So i played it all the way through from 1 to 3. Awesome storyline. Personally feel the 2nd was the best. but they were all very enjoyable.
5,"WOW, That Sums It Up","If you agree with the saying ""Getting there is half the fun"" this is the game for you. I suggest investing in a guide or at least finding an FAQ somewhere for the planets, unless you enjoy running all over looking for things which is fun too. Whatever your exploration style, this game can help you do it. From the huge galaxy you can explore once the prologue is done to the individual planets you can land on and even the huge space station introduced in the prologue you will not want for adventure. I'm about 13 hours into the game just doing optional missions. I've only completed a quarter of the main storyline, and there are many more things I've yet to do! Driving the tank-like Mako on any number of very detailed planets, none of which are the same and many that have their own weather patterns, is a blast (literally if you run into trouble, it's got a great cannon). I'm looking forward to the next one and I'm still working on this one! Viva la trilogy!"
2,Boring and repetitive,"I ordered this game thinking it would be like BioShock or Halo. Boy was I disappointed! I only managed to play for a few hours before sticking it back in its case and shelving it. The graphics and audio are great, but that doesn't make up for the boring story line and snails-pace movement. With the exception of a couple of short battles, the gameplay has consisted entirely of listening to long-winded dialogue and selecting from canned responses so I can listen to more long-winded dialogue. Perhaps, as other reviewers have mentioned, this changes the further you get in the game but I for one am not willing to waste time finding out."
3,not what I expected,I beat the game in 14 hourssadly it was not even close to Oblivion or Morrowind or even KOTORyes the graphics where great and the story was good but ....i wanted to explore the galaxy...beef up my charactor...find a bar and get drunk......it was a good game nothing spectacular in my bookBioshock wipes it off the map
3,Too Slow on 360,"I think this game would have played better on the PC because the load times for the console really ruined the game. There are great RPG elements to the game in customizing the character and a relatively smart dialog system. The cutscenes are beautifully rendered and the story is as good as sci-fi gets. The gameplay, however, is lacking in action, and the dialog and quests are pretty boring. This is the type of game for someone who likes wandering around a virtual world for hours.One major pet peeve was the expensive weapon upgrades and not obvious ways of earning cash to buy them."
5,One of the truly great games of all time,"I don't claim to be a hard-core or big-time gamer at all. I play occasionally when I've got free time. When I first bought this game, I thought, meh, just another run around and shoot-em-up game....was I wrong.This is hands down one of the truly greatest games of all time. Here's my short list:1) Final Fantasy X - the greatest2) Mass effect - the second greatest3) Mass effect 2 - the third greatestThe storyline easily rivals any Hollywood movie, though the characters are deeper, and you actually control their actions. Though its too light on combat, that's just fine for me. It actually makes to re-visit outer space and want to educate yourself on planets, stars etc.The Mass Effect series is shaping up to be one of the greatest of all time. It really is a great, outstanding start to what looks to be a great series. A lot of the game is optional, leaving the player with a LOT of room to stray from the main storyline. Truly great."
3,Good ideas drawn out over time,It is enjoyable learning about the characters and story. The game mechanics are irrelevant or overly repetitive. The graphical interface is easy to use. The game play is very linear. It is unfortunate that the choices in the story are rated as good or bad rather thank just alternatives. Overall a fair game.
5,"Immersing, amazing story. Totally recommend it.","I bought this game with the hopes of getting into something new. Mass Effect was something I was aware of but didn't try for years. And finally a few weeks ago I ordered this one. In a nutshell, it is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. The story is so engaging, the representation of planets and the way you interact with them is so immersing. Characters, acting are outstanding. The choices you make truly hit you and truly make you wonder whether you made the right choice or not. Epic game. Buy it, enjoy it."
3,Should have been better.,"This game left me so disappointed that I am selling it and getting out of the xbox 360 platform entirely. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I don't think so because compared to another recent game (Uncharted on the PS3), ME pales in comparison. I am not going to bash Mass Effect. My intent here is to temper other people's expectations. Mass Effect is probably a decent game for anyone who has already burned through the best 360 games out there. It is not, in the opinion of this reviewer, the best game ever. It isn't even as *fun* as my other xbox Bioware favorites of Jade Empire and Kotor. My advice is to buy a PS3 and get Uncharted. Why? Because you pay and play these games for the fun of it and for my gaming dollar and time, the PS3 with Uncharted offers much more of both."
4,Good game,"Game is great, indepth RPG. The saving points aren't great. You fight all the way through areas to die at the end and have to start all over. Fighting mechanics are not great. The story and graphics redeem shotty gameplay."
2,Not Recommended,"The practice tests in this book were terrible! In more than one instance, the answers were incorrect according to my textbook and one of the questions had 3 answer choices that were identical! Compared to the AP questions we recieved from my teacher, the ones from the Barron's review book were quite off."
5,Here I am to Worship,Excellent CD! Listened to it all the time when I was on vacation. Everyone loved to hear it. The first song is the best. But the Amazing Love song tells it all!!
4,Very Informative,This book is actually the text book used for one of my classes. Thanks to this guide I was able to take the challenge exam and skip the class altogether. The layout of the book made it very easy to navigate.
2,a little bit disappointed,"after two months, it stop working, I have the battery replace in Sears watch repair, after 2 hours it stop working again. Contacted amazon and they said they`are not authorized reseller and I have to contact movado myself` I insist and fought for its warranty because I bought it from them, finally I sent it to movado and they repair it."
2,Aaaagh - no webclasses,"Seems like this is a VB5 book with limited coverage of DHTML. One of the most important features in VB6 is webclasses, and they are not mentioned at all, not even in the index. A bit disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"Not what I expected.Firstly, it was rather thin. For a book about arguably the best known comic hero it weighs in at a less than impressive 128 pages. I bought the Spiderman version at the same time and was impressed by that. In comparison, the Batman version is very lacking.Not enough classic Batman. Would have loved to see more old time original stuff. Too much of the futuristic Batman stuff.The sections on the Batmobile and Batcave were good, but again, it looked like all new stuff. Not much on the classic look. Same thing goes with the villains.Seems the book was really showcasing the new look Batman world. It's obviously a matter of taste; this one wasn't up to my standards."
1,This book is out of print for a reason. It is appalling.,"Nobody bought this book because it was panned by the acdemic press. It is dire. If you should stumble caross a second-hand copy, do the world a favour. Burn it.I will never forgive Goldhill for the hours of my life that I wasted reading this tripe."
5,Fresh and Delicious,"How could an album as incredible as this be out of print? Why was this marvelous album only released in Japan? ""Filth and Dreams"" is a sensual, cool pastiche of pop, jazz, hip-hop, easy listening, and bossa nova. Put it all into a blender and out comes this delicious concoction. ""Closer Than The Sun"" is my pick-to-click, but really the whole album plays through gorgeously. Truly one of the great albums of the '90s, ""Filth and Dreams"" cozies up to you like a lover and won't let go. The CD is rarely out of my car player because it has staying power. It sounds contemporary as well as retro. Do yourself a favor; stop reading this and buy the CD. Your life will be enriched beyond your wildest ""dreams""."
1,Disappointed,"Swing Out Sister is my all-time favorite music group. However, this CD's avante guarde approach to jazz was a disappointment for me. The discordant arrangements are a far cry from their normal very cool treatment of contemporary jazz."
1,"if you enjoy fainting, read this book!","This book is tedious and only slightly suspenseful. How many times can one woman faint? I actually laughed out loud when after the 12th time, her husband says, something like, ""honey, this isn't like you."", I mean where has he been for the first 2/3rds of the book? The dialog is horrible and the situations are unbelievable. blah!"
1,Lousy and absurd.,"I'm always excited to see a new horror novel on the shelf. There just aren't enough of them out there these days to satisfy me. And I even enjoy the bad ones if they're fun. This one, however, was awful. I hated every one of the characters by the third or fourth chapter. The female protagonist is overly sensitive, paranoid, sees ominous signs in just about everything, (then obsesses about it for several pages,) and she faints 3 or 4 times before the book is half way through. The husband is a dolt, hot tempered, and also easily offended. The son is just a hateful brat. I guess the author wanted to create ""family tensions"" as a backdrop to the ""spooky happenings"" but it was so poorly done and unrealistic you'll hate these melodramatic people half way through the book. And even the supernatural elements are ham-handed and absurd. Over all, an amazingly bad book and really disappointing. ..."
3,It was interesting.,I dont normally buy a show episode but I was bored and I saw this. Now being over weight myself and dating a smaller guy the title messed with my head enough that I had to watch it. I thought the show was informative but they lost the big picture with the couple. Now I have been working on my weight and have lost a good amount of what i need to lose (about half)when I met my boyfriend. After watching this I discussed what I saw and asked him his point of view. I am not near ready to get married just yet (and he knows that) but I wanted to know if this man loved who I am or who he thought i could be one day. He said said that he fell in love with me and if i stay heavy but am healthy he is ok as long as i always try and stay healthy. In the show they never addressed why this guy was so obsessed with her looks when he himself was over weight. In my opinion she should have dumped him and did it for health reasons. When your goal is for someone else you never get lasting results.
4,"very good, but hold the superlatives","Yes, Aníbal Troilo is one of the all time great names of tango, and yes, his 50s recordings are musically outstanding. But sonically these LP transfers on the Mexican label Orfeón are poor - even his 40s recordings have better fidelity. Orfeón may have acquired the rights to these recordings on Music Hall but they audibly have not acquired the masters, which are still believed to be languishing in a vault somewhere in Bs.As. Nevertheless, collectors will be buying this to hear what Troilo was doing in the early 50s. If you're looking for your first Troilo cd, or for something with adequate fidelity to play at a milonga, you must look elsewhere"
5,works great,I purchased this product because I was tired of dealing with the electric start on my nitro rustler. Admittedly I let the car sit for over a year and the engine seized. the electric starter couldn't produce enough torque to turn the engine over so I installed the pull start in less than 5 minutes and it started the rustler right up.
3,love all summer,"i already had a copy of ""harrard experiment"" and it is still a very good movie. i remember seeing ""the harrard summer"" when it first came out and so when i saw that these two movies were together, i rushed to buy it. well, the mind must be the first thing to go as you get older because ""love all summer(harrard summer) was not what i remembered it to be. it was worse.buy the film for the harrard experiment and you won't be dissapointed."
5,Harrad Experiment Review,"The item was sent as advertised. Although I had seen thismovie sometime back, it was a great experience to see it again."
4,Mostly great.,"I've come to appreciate the ""Rolling Thunder Revue"" portion of Bob Dylan's career a lot more than I did at the time it happened. I still think he did a demolition job on some of his most well-known songs when he toured with this aggregation--it's a miracle that ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You"" and ""The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll"" survive the mauling he gives them here. But other songs and performances are aces, among them ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry,"" ""I Shall Be Released,"" (in a duet with Joan Baez that shows HER off to great effect!) ""Isis,"" and especially ""Simple Twist Of Fate"" and ""Just Like A Woman."" The drum-and-bass axis of Howie Wyeth and Rob Stoner keep the beat intact and late guitar-hero Mick Ronson and violinist Scarlet Rivera augment rather than overpower the scene. This was a particularly off-center chapter in Dylan's VERY off-center musical life, but this recording makes for great listening almost 30 years later."
5,lets go get stoned,Whoa! Still selling postcards from the hanging....more great stuff from a man always ahead of our time. Listen to the future.
1,One star is one star too many...,I guess I missed Dylan somewhere along the line. This is not the Dylan I knew in the 60's. A terrible collection of noise.
2,ONLY CD THERE IS NO BOOK :(,"It's incredible, there is not such book, it's only a CD( 40 dollars for a CD amazing huh? ). :(Any single person desire a BOOK AND a CD, in order to read at nights in bed. NOT ONLY A CD. The editorial must be take care of that.A dessapointed client.Francisco"
1,Effective C++,"This is the most disapointing book on C++ that I have ever read. Not only are the author's ""simple"" examples unrelated to anything that programmers do in the real world, they are written from the viewpoint of the programming gods on Mount Olympus. Does anybody really care whether your ""pointer to a derived function of a virtual base class that inherits nothing, can end up being a consternation for those expecting a pure, inherited pointer to a class that is virtually derived?""Huh? Enough said.C++ is an obscure language enough. And not one that will be around for very long in view of the developments of web programming in general. It will always be a basis to start from -- then once learned, quickly forgotten, like Latin.If you want more from this book then study FORTRAN, the precursor of the Latin we all know (and are struggling to work with to this day)."
5,Great Gardening tips,"Another useful Baker gardening book...almost too much information, but the bug begone especially saved my plants in the spring. A word of caution to novices: sometimes 20-gallon hose spray liquid mixtures are strong and cause plant damage if sprayed too close or directly on plants; suggest spraying around the yard to dilute before using directly on garden vegetable plants. Love all his tips!"
2,Trying to returnyhis item,i have been in contact with the seller ( amazonassociates @store wow.com )and they have no record of this purchase. I spent days on the net and the phone and they don't know anything about me or the order. I received the camera from Seattle and not from Florida. I have since returned the item to the address on the tracking # and I really don't know if the seller listed on the tracking # will give me the credit for the camera's returnJackie Rainey
2,Not a big fan.,"Spring is weak and pops off. Arms do not slide in or out smoothly. It is a real fight if you are upside down, standing on your head. If it will fit your filter well and you have three hands this is the wrench for you."
2,Spring mechanism failed on 2nd use,I change my own oil on my Z and this wrench adapter worked great the first oil change. Upon doing my 2nd oil change the spring shot off and I for the life of me could not find it. Searched everywhere. Disappointed as the grip was great. Outside of 30 days so that was a waste of some hard earned money.
2,Cant use it,I think the idea is great but the filter on my Honda is just too small and it wont adjust any smaller. It would help if they were to put a man and min diameter that it can take on the advert.
1,Didn't work,"It did NOT open the filter because it slipped on filter. Design seems flawed and unless filter is loosely mount, it may not open."
5,Critical for Do-It-Yourself Oil Changes,"I have about 6 vehicles that I am responsible for oil changes on. Unfortunately for me, no two of these vehicles use the same size oil filter. Do to varying amount of clearance on each vehicle I need all sorts of tools to get the job done. Cap wrenches, strap wrenches, plier types, and jamming a screw driver through the side are all things of the past now that I have this tool, and its smaller size sibling. All you need is a socket wrench, Possibly an extension bar and some sockets for the drain plug and you can confidently get the job done in no time. The biggest selling point of this item that should be in bold lettering is that you don't have to worry about bloody knuckles any more! Even if a friend or loved one changes your oil for you, you should buy this product and give it to them as a thank you gift."
4,Want to success in the business? Be customer driven,"After reading this book, your should know the importance of treating your customers well:external customers and internal customers. This book is easy to follow with clear structure and concise wording. This book also teach you how to be the customer driven company. Moreover, with the tool kits, you can really move from talk to action. ""if you treat your customer good, they will come back, if your treat your products good, they never come back"", which mean that to run a success business, you are not only have to produce high quaility products but also treat your Customers well. Check out from this book now to know how to be the customer driven company."
1,Wasted my money...,"I first heard Jonatha Brooke from her track ""Dog Dreams"" on the Big Times in a Small Town compilation CD put together by Christine Lavin. I adored the song!So, I decided to order this CD by the Story, with Jonatha Brooke and her musical partner, Jennifer Kimball. I was sorely disappointed. All of the songs sound alike, with the same thin, whiny over-produced sound. I do not even like the studio version of Dog Dreams.Terrible, terrible CD. Because the track from Big Times in a Small Town was so good, I'll try other Jonatha Brooke CDs, but I won't buy any more of The Story."
1,silent film fan,"This is my first review so i will keep it brief. I own all four treasures. The first two are excellent, i haven't watched the third one yet. This one is horrible unless you like watching dull and blurry films.The movies begin,Saved from the flames, and Avant garde 1 are all better choices."
3,3/5,"This game is one of the slowest, most boring, yawn inducing tripe I have ever played in the history of video games!Other RPGs that I highly recommend are: Arx Fatalis, Dungeon Siege, NeverWinter Nights, KOTOR 1&2!"
2,bad controls left me bored the first night,"sorry, i know this is suppose to be a great game...but i couldn't get into it at all. combat was terrible, just atrocious. the quests were ok, from what i did...there wasn't much direction though so it was a lot of guess work, and find the hiding npc or item...which wasn't fun when you found out your missing an item, with no leads at all as to where that item might be located. in a world as big as elder scrolls(good thing), finding something with no idea as to where it is(very bad thing) in a huge world, just isn't good at all."
4,A very good RPG game.,"Morrowind:Although certainly subject to opinion, as Role-Playing-Games go, this is one of the best. As far as I know you have to follow the ""Blades"" quests in the game in order to complete the game. But other than that, it is pretty much go where you want to, do what you want. I think there are at least 8 other factions in the game whose quests you can follow, but non are necessary except for enjoyment and re-playability.Other things that make this game enjoyable are that the interface is not overly complex and easy to use. Also, the menu system is quite easy to use considering the large number of items you will likely carry and the tasks you can perform using the menus.The two expansion packs add some to the game, but not that much. Tribunal adds a nice feature of being able to add notes to the game map."
1,Poor interface ruins a great idea,"This could have been one of the best games. The open playability is great, the characters and storyline are interesting, the fights are the right difficulty - BUT - the game is nearly impossibly to navigate. Clumsy two handed controls just to move and a lot of letter keys to remember for any given action. Also, while the graphics are decent, the viewing choices you are given go from bad to worse. :( I was really looking forward to this, and hoped I'd get used to the odd controls and view in time, but I finished the game still clumsy and disgruntled."
1,Requires two hands,"You know I bought this game think I could play it, but you know what I booted this game into my xbox and it didn't work. Took me a while to figure out that it was a pc game, so I got it installed and it ran well, but you see I was born with one hand, and could not manage to play this with one hand. I mean what the hell a mouse and a keyboard are required to play, last bethesda game I buy."
2,Not for everyone.,"I love RPGs, both PC and console. I've played the big names, and whichever of the little ones I could find. So, of course, I tried Morrowind. To be honest, most people either love or hate this game. I can see where the love comes from - Morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness. It boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns. It also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons. However, I can also see where the hate comes from. I do lean to that side after all. The combat and magic systems are terrible. The NPCs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab. With freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness.Don't get too caught up in the ""Game of the Year"" title, or rave reviews - bad reviews neither. If you get the chance, try the game first. That's the only way you'll know where you stand. Keep an open mind, but don't think that you have to like it."
5,I enjoyed it very much.,"This book is not only suspenseful, with interesting characters and intriguing plot turns, it captures certain new and encouraging developments in the life of today's aging male. As the story shows clearly, in this era of improved nutrition, enhanced medical care, and increasing life spans, getting older is by no means the dreadful thing it used to be."
2,"Wrong Reason, Could have had better description.","This product is for Xbox 360 MEMORY UNITS not Hard Drives as apposed to the description. If used for the correct reason it appears it would work. I got a full refund,though. Also, this is an Unauthorized Product made by Datel, in case you wanted to know."
1,I don't know yet.,"I ordered the item to take my profile off one xbox 360 and to save my profile onto a computer hard drive. The xbox is not mine,but a friend and I have had so much fun playing Boarderlands I purchased the game. I also purchased a memory card to serve as another way to transport data. I got the Transfer Kit so I could open the file on my computer and mod the backpack and try some other things. I have vista on my computer and the program will not respond to anything. I need to get a patch or an update I believe to get it to work properly. As it is I am serving my country in a war zone and I don't have a good way to get a patch or a way to get the extra Boarderland maps. So I am S.O.L. for the time. If I could ony get the program to respond I would try it.I do have an xbox at home. Maybe I will just have to wait untill I get back."
1,Worst Transfer Kit ever,"Xploder at least worked but this one wouldn't even read the MU and not to mention the software is a joke trust me save your money never buy this,Xploder is much better or get you a usb memory stick"
2,Not an Upgrade tool!,Don't buy this if you are upgrading Xbox had drives. It is a save to PC only tool.
1,THIS IS NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!!,"BE FOREWARNED!!! THIS ITEM IS NOT GLUTEN FREE, EVEN THOUGH IT CAME UP ON MY SEARCH OF GLUTEN FREE COOKIES!!! THIS IS EXTREMELY MISLEADING. THIS SHOULD NOT BE COMING UP UNDER GLUTEN-FREE FOOD ITEMS. I CANNOT EAT THESE AND WILL HAVE TO GIVE THEM AWAY BECAUSE AMAZON HAS A POLICY ABOUT NOT RETURNING GROCERY ITEMS. I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER REVIEWS BEFORE ORDERING THEM. AMAZON NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, AS THESE SHOULD NOT BE COMING UP UNDER GLUTEN-FREE FOOD ITEMS."
3,Not Gluten Free?,"So these are wheat free but not gluten free? That may be an important distinction to make. My rating is null and void as I have not tried these. I had to rate these in order for my comment to be accepted. I am gluten intolerant and barley, I believe, has gluten in it. I reeeeeally wanted to try these. I miss oreos (and pizza with real wheat crust)."
5,Yum!,"Great blend between chocolate and mint. I love these because my daughter thinks she is getting oreos, which I won't buy. If you get them 6 boxes at a time they are only $2 per box. That is a great deal!"
3,Somethin' ain't right here...,Maybe it's just me but these cookies seem to have less creme in them than the ones you can buy locally?Pros:+You get 6 packages cheaper than it costs to go out and buy them+Cookies are fresh+Qualify for free shipping!Cons:-Cookies seem to have 1/2 the creme as store bought
2,Cookies are too tough,"I have tried three of the newman's own cookies (9 oz.)through Subscribe & Save, the mint creme, chocolate peanut butter, and ginger creme. The ginger creme was the hardest to eat, despite the delcious creme, was hard to bite into. I can't imagine those who have sensitive teeth to be able to chew these cookies. The other two newman's cookies did not have this problem. The mint creme was the best of the three, having a slight mint taste, which I finished all of the packs in nearly two days. It was that good. The peanut butter chocolate was OK, but tastewaste nothing special. It was cheaper through Amazon than the grocery store which sold the same. Kroger is the closest which charged double in my area."
5,Absolutely fantastic book,"I've read a lot of books by South Asian authors and have been disappointed more than enthralled since so many write novels with extremely depressing characters and storylines.Not this one though! This book had be captivated from the beginning and I found myself extremely interested in every single character storyline--including that of the city of Bombay. I was also pushed to do a little more research into the Parsi's--where they came from and what their history is. I was truly fascinated by the ""Tower of Silence"".Great book Umrigar!"
3,"Fairly interesting, but...","Some of the characters are interesting and come to life. However, there is a tendency to purple prose (one of the characters hears the sound of his heart breaking), too many cute little Indian phrases, and the occasional howler: as an example, ""valorized""(!) instead of ""valued"". There is no real story, just a series of vignettes. This author just is not in the class of Rohinton Mistry, S. Taroor, or Jhumpa Lahiri."
5,This is my standard Pound Cake Pan,"It's really heavy duty so it helps to crust up the pound cake good. I have a 10 inch pan and I bought it second hand from a baking company that went out of business, so they used it commercially and it's still holding up for me. If you love old fashioned pound cake from the South, this is what kind of pan we use."
5,Highly recommended,I would highly recommend study bibles from the late John Stott. He is a Bible scholar and I have learned a lotfrom his commentaries which allowed me to have a clearer understanding of the Scripture.
4,Riley Jensen,"Riley Jensen, the creation of Keri Arthur, is a leading lady capable of leading many toward her own goals -- and most, including me, follow her willingly."
1,"They Write Theme Songs Good, Unfortunately, That Doesn't Count For Anything","All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
5,Great replacement!,"Much better than original bulb. Easy replacement. Brighter, throws long beam of bright blue-white light. Better than buying entire flashlight, due to better construction of older model. Expect this bulb to last a long time due to nature of leds."
5,breath taking,"This first single taken from ""Have a nice day"" is some of Roxettes finest work, from the beautiful melody to the soft harmoneys and loud guitars. This song has everything you can ask for from Roxette and much more."
1,"boring, could not finish","There were some very dramatic things in this book, but the author told everything with the same boring drone. Awful."
4,gripping tale,better knowing it was a real life story. More than meets the reader in the beginning. Liked the authors narrative.
1,The book is not worth a dime.,The book does not give you any more information than your diabetic counselor will. There is more filler in this book that is unrelated to gestational diabetes. There also is some contradiction in it as well. Don't buy it.
4,Best book out of 3 that I bought,"I bought 3 books when I was diagnosed with Gestational diabetes: 101 tips for Healthy Pregnancy w/ Gestational diabetes, Gestational Diabetes: what to Expect & this one. This one was the best I thought. It had a real food guide (my main questions were how do I control my diabetes with diet), the others just wouldn't come out & say ""eat this"" ""don't eat that"". Plus the author writes to the women with the diabetes, very direct & personable. I am giving this book to my midwife so she can share it with her patients instead of just Gestational Diabetes: What to Expect."
2,adds 6 inches to footprint,"for some reason this adds 6 inches to the foot print. This means that you need 6"" more desk space behind the unit."
2,"Bright, but will change the color of housing when off","I got these because I thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs, but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well....blue. More than I anticipated they would. Then I tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color. They are nice and bright when working, but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look, stick with a clear/amber/chrome bulb. Also, pretty pricy for a small simple bulb."
3,Good Album,This is an awesome collection of songs but I think that album kind of lacks energy. I would recommend the live versions of these songs which you can find on their live releases.
1,What's the point?,"Not at all what I hoped for, this book does not do much for you, if you're planing on useing it to help you manage your low carb diet you'll find that this book is kind of crippled it does what the title implies, but it does JUST that, it would make a BIG difference if it stated if the number of carbs it lists include fiber content or better yet, if it listed both carbs and fiber."
4,"Nice fit, but bulky","The underwear fit good, and feel good. The fabric of this style is a bit bulkier than I anticipated. Order one size up."
4,Amazing arcade shooter!,"When I first saw Time Crisis 4 at my local gamestop, I dismissed it immediately after seeing the price tag. $80 is alot of money for something that you don't know if you'll like. When it went on sale for almost half the price on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I was surprised by how fun it was. The led's are easy to place, and the calibration is incredibly easy. It only takes 5 seconds to calibrate the motion sensors. The arcade mode of gameplay was amazingly fun, and completely replicated those great arcade shooters. The story mode is pretty fun also. The controls are good, but hard to get used to. It looks really good on the Playstation 3. I was surprised that it didn't look like a last generation game! This offers up some good gameplay and a lot of style. I highly recommend picking up a copy of this game, especially if you still enjoy playing arcade shooters."
3,the gun the is the downside,the gun is not made for lefties. my husbands a leftie so holding the gun was a little bit of a challenge. i would recommend it for anybody who loves first shooter games and arcade games.
4,New Gen?,"If you are considering this game because you want to experience all the euphoric feelings of the past then go for it. it's still a fun game just nothing new. graphics haven't been updated at all. one addition of a different game play mode is fun. still luv the gun, but expected more, nothing special. Enjoy."
1,The WORST Video Game My Poor Eyes Have Ever Seen,"Do not buy this game. I got it for 4 dollars at my local Gamestop. It's one of the worst games ever created in humankind's history. The game is meant to be played in an arcade, not at home. Horrendous menus, gameplay, graphics, story, everything. Absolutely trash."
4,2nd Controller,"I already had this game, I bought a second used one so I could have my wife shoot stuff up too. Its pretty fun on single player (arcade). Two players would be fun if the split screen wasn't so small. Unless you have a huge tv, seeing the people onscreen becomes difficult.The target shooting mini game is addictive with two players. It's all on a single screen so the screen doesn't shrink."
4,the book,"This book more then any other is the ""unofficial"" Cajun and Creole cook book. John Folse is a born and bread south Louisiana boy and makes an excellent cook book. The book and recipes are awesome.There is also a lot of depth on the history of Louisiana itself and how the cultures have mingled not just in architecture but also how it has influenced the cuisine of the area.However I cannot give the book a perfect rating because of the condition of the book its self. It will need rebound soon which is no big deal but also there was a brown spotty sticky substance on the front cover.But other then needing rebound and the spotty substance the book is a wonderful addition to anyone who is a home cook or works in a restaurant and make authentic cajun and creole food, desrets and drinks."
5,Great Book full of fantastic information,"I started looking for a good creole cajun cookbook for my Husband and saw this, problem was it was hard to find. It was well worth the search and money! My Husband has a great love for all things creole and cajun and he has had his nose in this book since Christmas. Its not only a cookbook full of recipes, it has wonderful history of how creole cajun came about. I highly recommend this to any person with an interest in these things!"
1,Not Very Exciting,"I've been reading SciFi for over 50 years, and these two books are best described as occasionally exciting to downright boring. JimJoy Wright, the main character, spends much of his time in the first book shaking his head, and in the second book pulling his chin. In both books, he sighs constantly in response to events, at least once every page or two. When the author finally does include a few action pages, we get all sorts of italicized Marvel Comic Book sound words like Crunnnch.., and KKCHHhhewww!!,and Thuddd!!, etc, not to mention bleep, burp, etc etc. These attempts to bring sound to the written page fall flat, but do a good job of detracting from any actual action going on. For some reason I did get through the two books, with a lot of page skimming, but I'm not sure why--maybe in hopes of finding something redeeming. You can find many, many better SciFi books to read. Skip these two."
5,does what it says,"we put this in are 96 buick century special wagon 217000 miles, smoothed out the shifting best to start out with new fluid chang we went synthetic (mobil 1 ) new transmission in a year. this and a flush should get us there. am buying more for are park avenue new tranny in that lets see if we can get 200.000 out of it"
2,"Works great with IDE, but not with SATA","Great product if you want to use it with IDE driver, just plug the power and the cables and you are set to go. But don't buy it if you want to use with a SATA drive, have tried for several hours to get it to work, but cannot get the HD to get recognized."
1,Not worth the price,"This is a very old USB Bridge (USB to SATA/IDE) using dated technology. It does not work with over half of my hard drive test needs. I upgraded to an All-In-One-Driver USB connection. It is FAR superior to the bridge for sale here. It has LEDs to indicate the bridge's status, it works much better with both IDE and SATA drives (laptop and desktop). I would recommend the All-In-One-Driver bridge....but not the USB Bridge listed here....cheap is no susbstitute for quality performance."
2,Samurai X is still important to watch,"Although it is true that there is an ending in the manga series, Samurai X ""Reflection"" goes beyond that and gives a fitting and unforgettable end to a truly meaningful series.I myself dislike these fillers dvds and wish that they had animated the jinchu arc, but, nonetheless, Samurai X will give all rurouni kenshin fans a deeper understanding of the series and give a thorough closure that no one will regret to watch.Samurai X, compared to the somewhat lighter and occasionally satirical normal Rurouni Kenshin anime, is more serious and real. The feelings expressed in it are all within the range of believability and thus more meaningfull and allows one to feel the delicacy and importance of the moment.Samurai X, ""Reflection"" gave an excellent closure to the unforgettable series and truly is a heart-touching ending. I highly recommend that one turns to Samurai X ""Reflection"" as the ending for this unforgettable series."
4,Great tool for the job.,"This is a pretty handy tool. Seems to me that whenever you get your oil changed at a shop, they tighten the filter way too much. This thing works great for that. My only complaint is that when you're only access is under the car this thing doesn't latch on tightly enough to the filter to not fall down so you have to hold there as you are working the oil filter loose. But that's not a big deal and this tool plus that fumoto valve, makes changing the oil ridiculously easy."
1,Save your money,I tried this on a 2010 RAV4 filter cap. (this car has a cartridge filter) All this thing did was chew up the cap and did not get it open easily. I was pretty useless reinstalling the cap and getting it to the correct torque.
3,Surprised by the High Reviews,"I am surprised by the high reviews this product has been given by others. Maybe I just had bad luck because the spring that was supposed to come with it was missing. I tried to use it without the spring and was unsuccessful... not because the spring was not there but because the unit was too large for my small oil filter ('05 Mazda 3). I will have to find an alternative tool for my car.At least Amazon was nice enough to refund my money for the missing piece. Regardless, it did not work on my oil filter. So be careful."
5,Just About Perfect,"Very happy with this tool. I changed out my Subaru oil and filter for the first time last weekend. The filter is at the smallest end of this wrench's size range, it worked great. No hint of slipage, with a very solid feel.The filter is buried up in between a couple of exhaust pipes and the oil pan, a real pain to reach without this tool. Previously I used the ancient screwdriver thru the housing trick. Great improvement!"
4,Good early 90s sound,"I found this CD in my mom's old collection. I listened once and was impressed. This guy has a really nice voice and sings about mature love relationships. If you liked Bobby Brown's ""Don't Be Cruel"" or any of Kieth Sweat's early stuff (and still listen to them), then you'll like what you hear here. It's just a good, classic, early 90s-sounding album with better than good vocals. This album may have slipped silently through the cracks, but it's definitely worth retrieving. Give it a try. Four instead of five stars simply because I discovered it nearly fifteen years after it was released and some of the songs sound naturally dated."
4,Who did the Greene Family In?,"This book was supposed to be last the trilogy with the Benson Murder and Canary Murder being the first two. The first book was to be about a single man, the second book on a couple, and this book on a family.The plot involves the murders of family members of the Greene family. It grows to be rather convoluted because at the end there are only two suspects left, and Philo Vance stays up an entire night figuring out which one of them actually was the murderer.Still it was a fun read of the old school of detectives, and I recommend it highly."
5,Maybe There Was Some Good Music In The 80's,"This is Phish's first real album, and boy is it good. This album has tunes for all levels of Phans. If you're a newbie to Phish, you'll love songs like Fee, Golgi Apparatus, David Bowie, and Contact. It took me a while to learn to like all of the songs, but as you become more aquainted with Phish, you'll begin to love this album. Phish throws lots of different looks at you on this album from the super-funky beat of David Bowie, to the hillarious lyrics of Fee and Contact, to the downright beautiful and sometimes Dead-reminiscent Fluffhead and Divided Sky. And if you like jazz, this is Phish's experiment with that style of music. I wouldn't recommend this as a first Phish album, but if you love Phish, you'll love this album, garanteed!"
5,My Favorite Album,"this is by far the best studio output by phish. if you are looking to start a collection this is definitely the one to start with (out of pure dumb luck, this was my first phish album). if you already like phish and have a few of their albums, but not this one, for god's sake buy this! now! why are you waiting. this is a phenomenal work of art. highlights include: fluffhead, icculus, you enjoy myself (the quintessential phish song), david bowie, golgi apparatus, well basically the whole album. just make sure not to listen to fee too many times, because it gets really old."
4,Great book for people who love history and sport.,I enjoyed reading this book. Ty Cobb was is a well known figure to the baseball world and is used at times to compare todays players to. This book brings out the many sides of this complicated man.
3,Good Book with Hidden Agenda,"This book really surprised me. There are many good tips for eating right and a lot of valuable information here, but the author ends up telling the reader that he/she is too weak to ever go back to eating any of the foods that he/she was addicted to (meat, cheese, sugar). Therefore, the reader must go on a strict vegan diet for life. Although I understand the value of such a diet, I am amazed at how this book goes in such a severe direction. Why can't someone possess enough willpower to keep meat and dairy products in their diet? I will keep this book for its valuable information but ignore the vegan fanaticism."
4,Good Book for the Newbie,"Disregard the review by ""G. Amato hebgbeez"", This book accomplishes what it was intended to do; to inform or convince the meat eater that there is a more nutritious way to health.Since Neal Barnard writes for Vegetarian Times we should assume he would endorse a vegetarian diet. This book is good reading with many suggeastions, charts and records for those looking to try a non-meat lifestyle.A great book is; Stop Inflammation Now!: A Step-by-Step Plan to Prevent, Treat, and Reverse Inflammation - The Leading Cause of Heart Disease and Related Conditions - Richard M., M.D. Fleming.I look at it this way: If your doctor told you, that the foods you are eating is causing all your health problems, would'nt you at least attempt a non-meat, non-dairy and non-sugar diet?"
3,Breaking Food Addiction,"The book is effective at helping a food addict like me steer clear of poor eating habits, however, it is a little cryptic when it comes to describing food elements that increase good eating habits."
1,¡Qué decepción!,"Lo confieso: soy una fanática de los libros de Pérez-Reverte.Me encantó ""El Maestro de Esgrima"", el primer libro que leí de este autor, y adoré ""La Tabla de Flandes"", uno de los mejores misterios que he leído nunca; ""El Club Dumas"" me sigue pareciendo una verdadera joya, y ""La Piel del Tambor"" es una maravilla. Y precisamente por eso, la decepción sufrida a manos de ""La Carta Esférica"" fue tan abismal y dolorosa.No parece escrito por Pérez-Reverte. El libro es aburrido, sus protagonistas parecen títeres huecos manejados por un titiritero aficionado y primerizo, que parece refugiarse en una trama tediosa y larga, para acabar en un final obvio y sin sentido.Es una verdadera lástima, pero el libro no vale la pena."
2,lleno de terminologia y nada interesante,"La carta esférica por Arturo Pérez-ReverteEste libro no logró interesarme, pese a que ya estoy a la mitad del libro veo que aun la acción dilata en llegar y los personajes protagonicos dan vueltas. Es desesperante esperar la acción que parece que nunca llega y ver el misterio del dei gloria que no se sabe lo que es. Para quienes comparan la novela con Moby Dick, este libro no le da ni por los tobillos. La obra esta llena de tecnicismos y términos marinos, pero en definitiva no es un gran libro y sinceramente sin animo de ofender no creo que sea recordado dentro de unos años. Los personajes se mantienen alejados y enigmáticos y parece que nunca llegaremos a compenetrarnos con ellos. No es ni siquiera un thriller, mas bien trata de ser una obra literaria de corte marino, al estilo Conrad y Melville, pero es solo un pasatiempo. No es recomendada.Luis Mendez"
5,Dad prefers these blades,"Glad we found this seller....not easy to find these specific blades anymore, and Dad prefers these blades to keep his beard trimmed up. The seller has been punctual about shipping for us several times."
5,GLOSSY MASCARA,"MY EYES ARE VERY SENSATIVE TO MAKEUP. SO I HAVE ONLY GOTTEN CLINIQUE FOR YEARS, AND I REALLY LIKE THIS. THANK YOU"
3,Seriously Dull not Seriously Wet,"Actually I bought this to spray on the engine like our detailer does, then rinse (hose) it off. Well that's perhaps a strange application and haven't even tried that yet, BUT; as a tire dressing it's no way ""wet"" looking. More like a teacher's blackboard. (Do they still use those?)"
1,Danger Alert!,"A family that belongs to our Temple tragicaly lost their toddler in December of 2008 when he became entangled in this netting. It was used on the pack n play in which he was sleeping... he stood up, became caught and was strangled. This is not the only case: netting and infants or toddlers simply isn't safe. If you would like to see more information on what happened, put ""Noah crib death Maine"" in your search engine to read various articles."
2,Sad,"I was waiting for this book to be published, because I was told from multiple sources that it was going to be a good source for ecological design and building schools, but i was extremely disappointed in this book. It is in no way comprehensive and I am not sure why you would publish a book like this that was not comprehensive.There is some decent information in here, but nothing that you can't get from spending a little bit of time doing some searches on the internet.It is a shame, because this type of book is needed and a great idea."
4,HP ph5712 - duplexer,"A few seconds to install, a long time to discover the printing preference that will make it function, and a long time for each page to dry on the first side."
4,HP Duplexer - Does what it is supposed to do.,I bought this because the printer that I had been using failed after many years of good service and the duplexer from that unit was not compatible (useable) with my new HP printer. There was a minor software (driver issue) but the unit has worked as advertised since the driver issue was resolved.
1,Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him?,"The writing in the two other customer reviews is far better, livelier and to the point than the author's. And hopefully, Kuh's reporting is more reliable than his L.A. restaurant reviews. Kuh initially whines that he couldn't make his story come alive: he was so right. His own (apparently unedited) irrelevant personal feelings, mixed into the tale, made this important story convoluted and almost unreadable.... a shame since he took up the time of so many illustrious people during his extensive research and also seemed to initially pinpoint important social themes. Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him? Keep your knives, Patric. And your day job."
4,Spode,Delamere by Spode is one of the great classic dinnerware patterns. It will stand the test of time and looks great in both elegant and casual situations.
4,Great price but they are starting to break already,These are nice but the flowers are starting to bust off after pretty regular use. For the price it doesn't bother me too much but probably close to a 1/4 have been thrown away.
3,Not a bad summer read,"I enjoyed this book. Although not classically written, the plot keeps moving and doesn't bog down. The chapters are short which makes it perfect for the beach. After reading THE HOT ZONE and then Robin Cook's CHROMSOME 6 this book fits well with these two books. The plot is simple. A virus infects people in Asia and a Micrbiology team from the US investigates. There are several sub plots which sometimes makes you wonder who are the main characters. This can be confusing. I would recommend to friends."
4,my daughter loved it!,"This mirror ball is awesome and was my 6-yr. old daughter's favorite b-day gift! The price is great for what you get. We liked that you could mount it on a stand, as we can set it up in different rooms that way. You can also mount it from the ceiling though. It slowly rotates for a really pretty effect in her bedroom at night. The separate lamp comes with color covers, but we haven't used that much because the metal lamp gets REALLY hot, so we worry that it could be a fire hazard if left on too long (the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars). Overall, a terrific buy!"
4,"Nice ball, great price","Nice ball great price, needs extra light if possible, but the one that comes with it will work for small to mid size rooms."
5,Excited about the book,This book was a Christmas gift and the person receiving the book was very excited to start reading it very soon.
4,Great Starting Point!,This is a gret overview of major world myths. It is a good introduction for someone who has no experience with mythology. The pictures and descriptions of the art work are the best part about the book.
3,a good survey with a few omissions,"This monograph is a very good survey of the QAP and its variations. The treatment is however far from complete. The exact method section excludes a lot of recent developments including RLT of Sherali and Adams. Recent results on polyhedral studies into the QAP polytope are missing. The heuristic methods is skinny and is missing neural network methods. Certain QAP variations such as placement problem are not covered. A chapter on QAP applications would have been helpful.Nevertheless, it provides a very good overview of a very important NP-hard problem: QAP"
5,Different Glasses,"Well, I bought the book because I'm an aquantance of Mr. Cohen. I was looking forward to seeing his quirky and hilarious personality on paper, not to mention his brilliance. I was definatly not let down. Let me go ahead and say, I'm a straight guy, and I loved every bit of this book. I still laugh to myself about some of the great lines. All my female friends keep trying to steal this book from me, especially while I was reading it.... I feel very privalaged to have thanked the auther himself for writing the book, because it was truly a treat, and a nice repreave from the more serious stuff I normally get into and write myself."
5,A great new addition to country music!!!,I taped the music video off CMT and keep watching it over and over!! Can't wait for more music.
3,natural philosophy naturally wrong,"i wish this were true. truly. it seems to that it just goes to show you the problem with natural theology. that it allows taht which happens to be, to be the end of matter. so poof, no problem with homosexuality as it is natural, so if it is natural then well it must be good, therefore homosexuality is good as it is naturally occuring phenomenon. the problem, and i wish his argument was true, is that any naturally occuring thing is, if it is truly natural, is good and ordained...such as well paedophilia rape, and murder.some of his other stuff on likeness and love are goodi felt the best bits were borrowed from rene girard, and the source was better in this case"
3,disappointing,"I enjoyed the first book very much, but the second book was disappointing for the following reasons: 1. Surprising actions by characters are explained away with rationalizations which are not consistent with the universe and the culture as outlined in the previous book. 2. The twists and turns of the plot did not seen to happen naturally; instead plot twists are contrived to surprise at any cost to provide a longer tale at the expense of developing the characters."
3,No sign of meat and potatoes.,"This is a great book if you want to practice speed reading. I scanned through the book looking for something exciting, interesting. No luck. The first part of his book Nick talks about the theory of UFOs and of a few who have encountered them. The book eventually tells of his experience with UFO reports, and his vague investigations. He adds throughout the book quick blurbs about other theories and random information. This must have been his way of spicing it up, but I found it irritating. There are no exciting stories of his days as a UFO investigator. Instead we are led along page after page, hoping to read something exciting and enlightening and never finding it. I'm sure there's a plethora of information and activity going on but you wont find it here."
2,"Terrible writing, research, and editing.","Luckily I was given a copy of this book. I have read the top 100 books in this UFO/Alien genre and this is not one of them. Suggest you try 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Project Blue Book), 'Alien Agenda' by Jim Marrs (Crossfire), and 'Unconventional Flying Objects' by Dr. Paul Hill (NASA UFO Scientist) which are the TOP 3 books in this genre with more information in any chapter than Nick Pope's book. The conspiracy thriller, 'Alien Rapture' with an 'insider' black projects co-author is my favorite of the Top 100. I find it hard to believe this rambling, poorly edited, and disjointed book of Popes is a best-seller in the UK."
1,Bland at best,"I was really hoping for a popcorn as close to movie theater butter flavor as possible, we sprinkled it generously and it was still lacking. I agree w/another reviewer who said it was salty but not ""Buttery"". Took the words right out of my mouth.I love Kernel Season's other flavors (especially White Cheddar) but will not buy this again."
2,flax crackers,"I am experimenting with raw food. This is o.k. we don't like the slippery ""seed"" texture of it. It just sort of melts back into seeds in your mouth. If your real hard core raw vegan, then try it. Other wise, I would pass."
5,Been a reliable cracker substitute,"I like these because they deliver good protein, good fat and not a lot of carbs. Subtract the fiber from the carbs and you got a negligible amount of carbs. Theres no junk in these like other flax crackers, that often have some type of grain flour added. These are pretty much as flaxy as you can get without making them yourself. The italian zest is my 2nd favorite flavor of this product line, right behind the mexican harvest."
4,A Wonderful Story,I enjoyed this book very much. I like Brenda Jackson's stretching of her skills in this novel. She tackled a much thought upon subject of interracial dating. I liked the characters Tag and Renee. She infused them with the reality of coping with societal pressures. Well done. Enjoy.
2,Unbelivable,"Unbelivable pretty much says it all. I didn't believe any of it for a moment. I've read books where the attraction between the man and woman was fierce and immediate and bought it totally. This wasn't one of them. The dialogue was stilted and corny. The multitude of vicious comments and stares from other people was over the top and I never once got the sense that this was actually an African-American women. From her long straight silky hair to her impeccable speech, other than when she made the comment ""I'm black and you're white' (over and over again), there was nothing about her to distinguish her from any other white heroine out there. Maybe that's what the author was going for but it struck me as unrealistic. My first book by this author. Probably the last."
3,Lacked Substance,"I did enjoy this novel, however I felt the romance between Tag and Renee was a bit rushed and was not very believable - this love at first sight is ridiculous- you cannot love someone you do not know. The author should have spent more time letting the reader get to know these characters by having Tag and Renee go out on a few more dates. THe differences in race -Tag is white and Renee is black, although mentioned and was an issue for Renee was not an overwhelming aspect of the novel. The love scenes were good if a bit tame. Overall it is the kind of formulaic romance novel of man meets woman and falls in love, man loses woman due to woman's insecurities, woman puts aside insecurities and goes for her man."
5,Brenda delivers again!!,I truly enjoyed this book! 's.Jackson writes a romance novel like no one I've ever read! VERY realistic and romantic indeed.
1,Constukction Of Garbage,"Horrible! Thank God (Godess, I'm a Wiccan )I didn't buy this trash. Someone recorded it for me and I painfully almost got three quarters of the way through it the second time around. After hearing this,I now appreciate The Construkction Of Light much more even though I believe it's the worst KC album. Aimless noodling, outtakes that no one ever should have heard. Robert Fripp is becoming a lot less musical in his old age, and greedy as well, releasing every last bit of rehearsal trash for public consumption. Give me Discipline !"
4,Don't get me wrong...,"I am a die-hard fan of the show. I tape every episode that comes on the Sci-Fi Channel. I've bought nearly every piece of merchandise via Ebay.I've read the complaints about the 2 episodes per DVD. Valid point, but I personally don't mind parting with $20 each month to support my favorite show. I'm going to spend money on this show anyway.The only reason I give this particular DVD only 4 stars is the lack of commentary by actors or directors. Other than that, it's great! The character background of D'Argo is both funny and informative; Anthony Simcoe is hysterical!"
1,Disgrace!!!,"Having to pay for $20 per 2 TV Episodes is what I call disgrace! DVD was invented for better not for worse! Act accordingly and don't buy these DVD's unless they become available in a much more reasonable price. Please note that I have not seen any episode of Farscape and although i was planning to buy the Series on DVD to try it out, I won't cause I don't like being fooled! Same thing they do and on Star Trek TOS. You 've got to buy 40 DVD's priced 15-17$ each! This will not stand!"
5,Boxed Sets Please!!!,My soon-to-be-wife and I are big sci-fi fans and were hooked from the first episode we saw and eagerly await each new broadcast episode. I did not start regularly recording the show until late in the 2nd season so I would love to be able to buy a boxed set. Like the other reviewers here I feel a bit cheated to have to buy a 2 episode disc when my friends in the UK can buy 4 episode discs or just get an entire season in a boxed set. ....I probably won't buy anymore of these DVD's from ADV until there is a boxed set.
3,How about Box sets??,"I bought a few of these after hearing great stuff about the show and I loved the episodes but I wont buy anymore because like the above reviews, only two episodes is not enough for me to pay a DVD every month or so. I want the season box sets and wont buy anymore until they come out with those. Great show though. Very imaginative, good stories and conflict. Recent Star Trek shows should get a clue and watch some of these."
3,"Not as good as most Farscape, but better than most other TV","Crichton (Ben Browder) finds love on an abandoned Peacekeeper battleship in ""PK Tech Girl."" This irks Aeryn (Claudia Black) and gives us our first clear hint of the potential for the great romance that is to come. Meanwhile, D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) and Zhaan (Virginia Hey) bluff a dangerous intruder and Rygel confronts old ghosts. A strong episode.""That Old Black Magic"" is less successful. A powerful sorcerer (Chris Heywood) kidnaps Crichton and brings him face-to-face with Crais (Lani Tupu) in order to feed off the resulting emotion. Despite a powerful performance by Heywood, the tremendous power his character must possess in order to bring Crais into the story makes him too implausible. In addition, much of the episode is talky and consists of our hero running around in a maze, which becomes tiresome after a while. However, we do receive some important and intriguing insight into Zhaan's character and history."
4,awesome purchase,"With the winter months upon us, this was the right time and and awesome find at the right price. Very comfortable, warm and inviting for a deep night's sleep"
1,B A D,"Bad performances, horrible music, is like a bad telenovela...why did he decide to do such a low budget looking film???? Sad."
5,Very concise and objective.,"Very concise and accurate. You won't waste your time reading it, Prof. Craig has introduced the concepts of soil mechanics in a broad and very objective way."
4,amazingly touching cd,i bought this album randomly one day in my favorite cd store and i fell in love with it almost instantly. i shed some tears and it made me travel. it does it again today. bringing back a lot of good memories. natalie merchant definitely is one of my favorite female singers.
5,Mad About this music,"A friend of mine introduced me to Hooverphonic a few days ago, and I have been thrilled with them. But one song in particular made me want to curl up and put it on repeat: Mad About You. This song has so many levels, it's difficult to describe, as is so much music. It begins with a beautiful haunting string progression that reminds me a little of old Bogart movies. It quickly becomes more modern, but it still has this beautiful Roaring '20s feel about it. Even the line ""Mad About You"" reminds me of the Sunset Blvd. ""Mad About The Boy""... If you have heard Hooverphonic, you will love this. If you like the new trend of bringing back beautiful old styles, like Big Band and Swing, and giving it a new flavor, you will also maybe enjoy this. I certainly have!"
3,This is Hooverphonic?? Never would have guessed.,"My favorite Hooverphonic is their very first album. I was actually shocked when I found out that Mad About You was Hooverphonic because it's much less funky and trip-hoppy than their old stuff. It's very catchy and addicting but I must say that the lead's voice gets a bit too high and grating at some point during the song, dragging it down a bit. I got the song off of a CMJ CD, and I'm not sure I would buy the song as a single import. If you like earlier Hooverphonic, be warned, this is VERY different."
4,pretty cool,This LP is tight..its on a differant tip to their debut set..this time around they touch upon much more complex issues and it ain't easy to understand the lyrics 1st time round cos they got cryptic meanings to em..definately ahead of its time and a classic in its own right..the beats are banging as well so definately check it out.
1,Warning - edited version,"Although Amazon says this is the full 122 minute version, they are mistaken. It is the edited-for-the-US-market 96 minute version. If that is what you are looking for, then this would get more stars. I've wasted several people's time and money over this mistake, but it is not what it says. The original Chinese version with English subtitles is the real 122 minute version."
3,works but..,"it does sharpen the knife.. but as other reviewers mentioned, it seems to achieve this by scraping off a bit too much metal. Maybe I am sharpening it too much??"
5,Works great!,"This knife sharpener actually sharpens knives! And for the price, it's a deal you can't beat! You will not be disappointed."
3,sharpens okay,"Does an okay job. No damage to knives. No skill required to use.This will not get knives razor sharp, but seems to do okay."
4,get one soon,"be it any knife, branded or local.. it needs sharpening. this is a very handy and affordable sharpening tool. it gives the basic sharp edge. had to use to sharpen the famous wusthoff knives which was a disappointment out of the box. thank god that i gave one this as well along with the knife set to my friend. it makes it complete."
1,Dulled every knife,Don't buy this! I can't believe people think this is a good sharpener. Dulled every knife I used it on
3,Not as great as first thought,"When I first got this item, I thought they are the greatest. But, after using it for a while, I see one minor problem. It lasts 5 or 6 years ONLY if you sharpen about 7 knives per year. After about 20 sharpenings, the carbide inserts had to be reversed. It lost it's sharp edge and wouldn't work any longer. So, one unit gives about 40 sharpenings before it needs to be replaced, or the carbide inserts replaced."
5,Amazing Tool,I would give this knife sharpener 6 stars if I could.Pros:1. Cheap2. Sharpens blades to a razor edge3. Takes less than 30 seconds to useCons:(Crickets chirping....)
5,sharp?,"Throw away your whet stones everyone, this is by far the best knife sharpener I've ever seen. It gets knives so sharp you can actually shave yourself. It's light-weight and doesn't take up hardly any room. Be careful you don't cut yourself."
4,good sharpener,Decent sharpener! Takes up little space in your kitchen drawers and does a good job at sharpening knives. I usually sharpen right before I cut veggies. You can tell a difference after you sharpen the knives.
5,Sharp Sharpener,"It works great. It's a lot faster than using stones. It will sharpen machetes, pocket knives, and even shovels."
5,Inexpensive-Simple To Use-Works!,"Looks like a toy-but the darn thing is the least expensive, simplest to use and the most effective sharpener I've discovered in my over 50 years of sharpening knives. Regular stones and those sharpening steels are great if you already have a an excellent edge and just need a few passes to refresh your edge. But this little gizmo actually will help when your edge is really dull-or even gone. It actually leaves tiny curly pieces of your knife in its wake as it literally allows you to recarve the edge when you apply a lot of pressure. Using it lightly at all other times easily tones up your edge to almost razor sharpness. Be careful w/your knives thereafter; you can easily wound yourself."
5,Great knife sharpener!,It sharpens knives and it does it well. The ergonomics are initially questionable but actually they're perfectly fine. It's just a different way of holding a sharpener. Best/quickest results - very impressed and will def. recommend to anyone looking for a good $ / performance product
4,"3x E - Easy, Effective and Economical",I was a little skeptical at first about this cheap piece of plastic that promised to do everything the more expensive sharpeners do but I gave it a try and I'm very impressed. Using this is extremely easy and quick. I used to use a stone+oil but staying within those few small degrees can be time consuming and difficult. This takes all the guesswork out of it. This will breathe new life into your dull knives.
4,Works,"Still surprised ... so many sharpening devices I tried were useless, but this one seems to work."
5,"Quick, Effective and Idiot Proof","I've tried all manner of sharpening gizmos for my kitchen knives but this one is the best for the price that I've ever owned. Once I had run a few blades through the Accusharp, both standard and serrated, I unplugged my Firestone electric grinder knife sharpener and tossed it in the trash. It took up alot more room than it was worth, was noisy, and couldn't put near the edge on my blades that the Accusharp does."
4,works ok,"its pretty good and puts a decent edge on the blade, Blue part gets torn up though after sharpening enough knives. :)"
2,Its okay for the price,For the price its okay it seem a little weak. I will say one thing that is to be careful while using this item.
1,Not impressed,"The reviews here are misleading. In my use, this item only moderately improved the sharpness of my knives."
3,"Sure, it works","It's one of those tools you don't consider a big deal, but it is ok considering its price. Change blades every now and then and you'll get your job done."
5,Exceeded Expectations,"I bought for keeping my fillet knives sharp. I have a few other sharpeners, but they are all going in a box! This is the sharpener for me."
1,Carbide sharpening destroys knife edges.,"I took a chance on this knife sharpener, as I was intimidated by the thought of using a whetstone and honing steel. This sharpener certainly is cheaper and easier, but wrecks havoc on the edge of my knives. I followed the directions carefully and ended up with a pitted blade edge. Don't waste your time and money on this product. Buy a proper whetstone and take the time to learn how to use it. Your knives will be much sharper and last for years. That will be an investment that pays off."
4,Fun - but not a little too short,"I think I pretty much agree with everyone else who reviewed this game. It's a fun game, especially when you consider that there aren't very many flight combat sims/shooters for the XBox. And one can't get over the beauty of the photo-realistic scenes you're immerse in at every mission. I'm not ashamed to say that I almost cried the first time I played a demo of this game on my 42"" Plasma HDTV. However, the game is a little too short. Plus there isn't much replay value. In addition, the cut scenes (that help fill in the storyline) used dated graphics that really pale in comparison to the graphics used in the missions.Overall, I'd still enthusiastically recommend this game. It just could have been better."
3,"Maybe after repeated listening, I'll up my review","I have to disagree with others in that this is their best yet. I still think Fly Between Falls is much much better. Don't get me wrong, this is still great music, with incredible vocals from Zach and very good songwriting with very catchable melodies and harmonies. But I don't think it has the depth or transcendence that Fly has. Even though they continue to demonstrate their mastery of classic R&B;, ala Marvin Gaye and even Stevie Wonder, woven around more bouncy jam-band influenced rythms, there are many times I have been listening to this and listening to the melodies and thinking...""oh-oh...hope they aren't going to start sounding like Hootie and teh Blowfish.""They haven't gone totally ""pop"" yet, and hope they never do.But who knows, I might be back here in a month or 2 after listening a few more dozens times to change my review entirely. I can be like that with music."
5,ALO simply amazing,"After seeing ALO support Jack Johnson I went out the next day and bought their first album Fly Between Falls, which I would says was amazing in itself. As soon as I was aware of the new record I had to get it shipped across the atlantic and was not dissapointed. Ever song on the album Roses & Clover is well written, brilliantly performed and a pleasure to listen to. My persoanl favourite tracks are Maria and Monday but I could listen to this album over and over and never get tired of hearing the beautiful songs. I recommend anyone who likes good music to get this."
1,Inside Coating Coming Off After 6 weeks,"It should be Papa ""J"" for junk.I've had a pair of VZ Papa G sunglasses (black frame,grey lens,polarized) for about six weeks now that I purchased locally and the lens coating that they had put on the inside part of the lens is already starting to rub/peel off badly. I take very good care of my sunglasses and this should not happen.I've never owned a pair of Von Zipper sunglasses before this and I can tell you that I doubt I'll be buying one of these cheaply made sunglasses ever again.I do like the way these sunglasses look and the tint is very easy on the eyes, but if I wanted to buy junk, I could go down to my local drugstore and get a cheap pair of sunglasses for twelve bucks instead of the hundred or so dollars that VZ sunglasses sell for.Stick with Maui Jim or Revo and, for the money, RayBan is excellent as well."
3,"a reference book, title suggests otherwise","based on the title of this book i was looking forward to a book which provided an explanation with good narrative, description, and historical context into the workings of congress. instead this book is simply a reference for terms and phrases used by and for congress. granted someone took the time to look up and define the many obscure terms and phrases but the lack of meaning and context is frustrating. a better title for the book might be, ""A Reference to Terms and Phrases Used in Congress""."
2,No strength at all.,"I'm a huge Tori fan, simply because she's talented and gives us so many beautiful songs, live cuts, covers, unreleased tracks and remixes. The title Jackie's Strength is beautiful, I mean, the original version. But here, the remixes sound too Kylie Minogue, especially the first and third ones. Such remixes destroy Tori's work, and Jackie's Strength did not deserve any metamorphosis at all ! The Father Lucifer remixes are exceptional, and even if the other remixes are good for the dance floors, it is not Tori at all. Fortunately, her albums are beautiful, Tori is powerful on stage, she'll always be a great performer and singer, and I'll always appreciate her. But come on ! Just listen to the original version of Jackie's Strength, then listen to the remixes and you'll see the difference."
2,Best track = Father Lucifer Remix,The ONLY decent track on this CD is Father Lucifer Sylkscreen Remix. It is by far the best Tori remix I've ever heard (next to Lipgloss Raspberry Swirl). All the other mixes on this CD are cliched mid 90s-style club mixes which make you cringe. They sound outdated flat and almost as dull and camp as the Springtime Of His Voodoo mixes. Jackie's Strength is NOT the sort of track which should be mixed into a club/dance type thing at all.I ended up burning the Father Lucifer remix on a home-made Tori compilation CD and throwing out the Jackie's Strength remix single.
3,"two Jackies confused, this one not for passive Tori fans","This maxisingle has several remixes of ""Jackie's strength"", all of which are pretty much the same. The Sylkscreened ""Father Lucifer"" is on THIS single. The videos are on the OTHER ""Jackie's Strength"" single that has been out for a while. The cover picture for THIS MAXIsingle is a picture of Tori clad in a beaded dress looking very sleek and creamy. Her hair is as red as ever (orange?) The OTHER single is much cheaper, and it has a B&W of her in the infamous wedding dress. this maxisingle is definitely good for the Sylkscreened Father Lucifer, but the price is kind of steep. If you want to buy this, I would reccomend you listen to a friend's copy first. If you are a DIE HARD toriphile, go for it. For the rest of you, stick with the B&W single. Cheaper and more diverse..."
2,Why read this when there are better books on the topic,"If you have a good understanding of the UML (and even if you don't) this book will not enhance your knowledge. The same applies for good modeling techniques and/or OO concepts - the book doesn't teach these. Then again it does not profess that it does so why blame it. The only reason I read this book is because it came with the Rose copy we bought. Frankly, even as a guide to Rose, it doesn't add much to what the (many) Rose manuals describe. The only people that should read this book, in my humble opinion, are those with a copy of Rose but without the manuals that come with it."
1,Fails to cover any topic in depth,"I feel this is a easy going readable book. One can go through the full book perhaps within a couple of hours. But this book lacks in the depth of coverage. It neither covers UML fully, nor covers Object Oriented Design concepts. It, in fact, tells most of the relevant steps of OOAD but only tells skin-deep concept of OOAD. One can perhaps read this book only to familarize how to use Rational Rose in the design process."
3,Light on Content,"This book is very light on content. Most of the rose documentation is light, with no real insight on how to use the tool to it's fullest."
5,Deeply touching history,"This is a story that needs to be told and heard. Hitler said something to the effect that no-one remembered Turkey's systematic extermination of the Armenians as a justification for Germany's attack on the Jews -- well, here is Turkey's other genocide that no one seems to know about. Enlightening and deeply personal, this is a must read for anyone remotely interested in the history of man."
1,Quite a biased book..,"This material in front of me is quite biased.There are no historical data, proofs but rather ""memories""..It is quite a read for its story line..But not its ""facts"".Just four question is enough: Why were the Greek soldiers on the soils of Turkey after World War I had finished? What was their their purpose in trying to invade Asia Minor? Can it be Megali Idea? And what can be the consequences if you attack to someone's homeland?"
5,"Pop Till you Drop, It does pop and rock justice",Great power-pop/rock compilation! A must own for fans of melodic pop musicHighlight Tracks from :SuperdragThe Pawn Rook FourSuperchunkNoah's Red TattooElf PowerKenny Howes and the Yeah!The Gladhands
2,not what I expected!,I was expecting to get a package of 4 when I made the purchase! I only got one keeper in the package
3,Ok,"This is an alright product. I bought it expecting it to be a set of four, but it is only one belt keeper. It does its job though."
5,Wonderfully Educational,This book is wonderfully educational. It takes you back to the beginning of furniture and walks you through the centuries providing you with the intial inspiration through Modern design. Great pictures too.
5,About Being an American,"As the book says ""kids long to be part of something bigger than themselves, something they can be proud of."" There are so many good ideas and resources in this book. As a grandparent now, I look forward to all the upcoming chances to share with grandchildren all the good things about this great country. Great homeschool resource. Great for teaching love and respect for our country."
1,Sad and scarry,"As a Republican I believe this kind if ideology is why our nation is suffering right now. Please teach your children to be intelligent, to think for themselvs and to search for both sides of every issue. American isn't infallible and it's damaging to our nation to raise the next generation of children with the assumption that the US is the greatest and is always right. PLEASE, if you read this book, look for the other side of the issues as well. It's got some neat ideas but it encourages people to make assumptions that aren't correct. Just be careful, don't be stupid."
3,Not a review...yet.,"My wife asked me to look up this book for her. I am intrigued by the comments on this book. I will have to read it and then write my review, unlike one of you who posted here. Unfortunately I will have to rate it now for my comments to go through. I'll rate it at the current average of all the comments thus far. Stay tuned."
3,Completely satifactory,I was pleased with my purchase. Book was in good condition and delivered in short time. Completely satisfactory service.
3,Nuenke is Nuts...,"...to think that the United States will disintegrate. Huntington's book is a helpful review of the world's main cultural systems, and Mr. Nuenke's review in January 2000 offers a legitimate critique about the role of natural selection in human development.However, Nuenke is blind to a very basic evolutionary factor. It is the tyrannical butchery of fellow tribe members by the Romans (see ""Gladiator""), Nazis, Soviets, and the Taliban that, ultimately, leads the butcher's own tribe to self-destruct.The modern West has developed a very different tribal model characterized by a deep and diverse gene pool, inviolate protection of individual human rights and many other factors which all favor ultimate survival. ....In his next book, Mr. Huntington should reconsider these aspects of his subject."
2,Out of Date,"The above book, although it has some insights, lacks one major thing: a reality check.All of his information dates from before the Asian collapse and the events of 9-11. He seems to write off the west as being weak and getting weaker and that the Other civilizations are working toward eliminating the West. While some of their cultural characteristics are hostile to core Western values, they are by no means a match. If you want a better assessment, try Victor Davis Hanson."
2,Interesting topics not properly organized.,"The book tries to explain the complex reality that evolves during the last century analizing the past, present and future of the main civilizations.Evidently Mr Huntington has researched a lot and read several writers before publishing his own work. This can easily be seen by the quotes (sometimes more than 50) at the end of each chapter.Some may agree (or not) with the author's thought but the way the ""story"" is told is definitely not well appointed.The description lacks of cohesion and makes the reading a bit boring.The book (just my opinion) has a sellable, hooky name taking benefits from the post WTC facts. Those facts make something like this (written in 1997) transform the author into a modern pseudo prophet."
1,There is only ONE civilization,"The author of this book seems to be quite limited in his vision. For certain, his background in world history and how different societies passed on knowlegdge and understanding to each other. I would discourage people from reading this book because the tries to isolate different parts of the world from the rest. That is not the case. We are all one civilization."
3,Reading with a critical eye,"Reading a book published almost 15 years ago, which itself originated from a paper almost 20 years old, I find the book worthy of reading, albeit some gross factual errors, such as the number of death in Tibet.Some people praised the book for its extensive research, which I felt the exact opposite. There were a lot of bigotry instead. Well, I concede that political science is not really science. As emphasized by many other reviews, it evidently overgeneralized an otherwise messy world for the sake of intellectual argument.Most importantly, if not read with a critical eye, this book could be a dangerous and harmful tool in the hands of the ignorance. There are plenty of such books in history.Please read it, please think while reading."
5,One of her very best albums...,"Hazell has outdone herself with this reading of Abba classics. The true standouts being ""S.O.S."", ""Winner takes it all"", and ""Mamma mia""The disc was finely produced by Hazell and Pete Ware; it stays true to the originals but gives Hazell enough room to have fun with these songs. This should be on your shelf next to ""Heart First"" and ""Always""."
3,Notation is a jumble and too many loose ends,The book is comprehensive no doubt however there so many loose ends in the explaining of concepts and techniques that you feel the book would have been much better pruned down a hundred pages or so. The exercises are also not really clearly defined and sometimes you feel that you have to do mind reading just to understand what they are asking for. Further on the notation in the book even though revised is a jumble and things keep showing up out of the blue without explanation or reference. The authors sometimes also take overly complicated mathematical paths to solutions rather than the intuitive and leave out the motivation which leads to a lot of frustration.(For example the Fisher Discriminant or the EM algorithm)
1,not a machine learning book,"I owned this book. This book introduces machine learning from the traditional stat point of view. I would recommend other books because (1) You don't want to read on if you find so many typos in the first several pages; (2) The data used in the book is still the iris data, which has only 150 points. How many data Google has to process?"
4,Lovely images,Love the images. I Wish there was a bit more room for daily entries but I am managing with the given space.
5,off to a great start,"This is my first camcorder, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I've enjoyed it so far. It's easy to use. The picture quality seems high. The only minor problem I've found is with the headphone input. Had to try three different sets of headphones before I could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is."
1,Panasonic PV-GS180 2.3MP 3CCD MiniDV Camcorder with 10x Optical Zoom,"The camera is a great camera.it is one of the best kind of camera in its level.Everything is great in that(perfect picture and easy to work) but in that package as I saw in amazon add, the remote suppose to be in the package and comes with it but it won't and there is not remute in that package and it is kind of cheating...be careful about this product if you think whatever has written comes with package but not."
5,A truly excellent book,"A fantastic little book for language arts study. Beautiful artwork for picture study, great poetry selections, dictation exercises, and more. We have thoroughly enjoyed it, and are looking forward to the next level!"
4,Beautiful Katamari,"My daughter, 7, loves this game. She can't get bored with it. It is challenging to build the moons ever larger. Recommend for children of all ages."
3,Not As Good As Previous Installments,"I purchased this game having played and completed the first Katamari game on PS2 and now with the 360 version, I was hoping to get more of the same enjoyment but with new mini-games and other innovations from the first installment. Boy was I wrong. The first Katamari game for the PS2 version was much better. There are good things about this game for those not famaliar with Katamari but if you've played the previous installments you may want to save your money. The controls for one are not as user friendly."
4,A fun-filled game with absolutely no logic.,"i only have one complaint. the controls are somewhat challenging, therefore making a sweet hilarious game somewhat less enjoyable. otherwise, great game!!"
5,Great Introduction to the Arts!!!!!,"Each and every one of these DVD's are adorable! My little one (one year) really enjoys the ART show best, but just gets so excited when the intro comes on for any of the videos. The images are so pretty...whether it is a painting, abstract shapes to music or dancing animals. We sit together and I explain the videos to her, they are short enough (20-30 min) so that you don't have the child in front of the tv for a long time. The format is similar for all videos but there is variation in the audience (animals shown with babies), etc. If your little one likes it...they will notice the differences. She prefers these MUCH MORE than Baby Einstein! I appreciate the choices made for these videos across the board. There is even an option for pop up notes on each video which provide you with additional artist/composer information. Very cool! A +++++++"
5,LOVE IT!,"My son had colic his first 3 months - my husband dvred this and one exhausting day - I turned it on. My son quieted down immediately & then started making happy sounds! Since then - it has been a staple in our home. I am not a fan of TV for babies - but having a fussy baby (who hated naps!) this & the Einstein DVDS gave me the 30 mins I needed to re-group...or do laundry...or clean...or make lunch. I prefer these to the baby Einstein DVDS - as I like the music better & the introduction to the Masters (the art show features work that are taken from Van Gough, Monet, Picasso & more!). My son is now 13 months. He is through that fussy stage (yay!) - but still loves Classical Baby. He recognizes the music when it comes on the radio & smiles. He try's to 'dance' to some of the music too. I love the Pilobolus piece...it is very much like the actual dance troop. What a wonderful introduction to the arts. Thank you HBO!Enjoy!"
5,Great Music and Wonderfully Made,"I purchased the set in 2005 for my 6-month old daughter. It was refreshing to hear the actual classical music performed by a symphony instead of the (whaterever it is) music from the baby einstein videos. My daughter is now 3 1/2 years old and I have an 18-month old. They both love to watch and get so excited when I mention ""baby show."" My 18-month old likes to dance and clap with the music and characters. My older daughter now understands the story line behind each song and we can talk about the video and what she sees while we watch. Each disc has 8+ individual songs - from slower and dreamy to upbeat and moving. The art and stories are so fanciful in each of the three videos. Many visitors see the video (no we don't play it ALL the time) and comment about getting a copy for a child, grandchild, niece or nephew."
4,An excellent look at the field,"This is a superb look at the nitty-gritty world of selling. Although the author does fill it with case studies, they are all useful and thought-provoking. My favorite bit of advice concerns what happens to all top salespeople: they get their territory cut. Why? To keep them from getting complacent, of course."
3,Atmospheric Gothic Doom Metal,"Very emotional and atmospheric Gothic doom metal with good use of between-song instrumentals and soaring female vocals. The only weak spots are the thin-sounding production and the male deathy vocals which are just sort of dropped into the middle of songs and don't mix well with the clean vocals. Still worth it for fans of sorrowful doom, or ambient Gothic music. Best song is the title track. I haven't heard their other record, but this holds a lot of promise."
3,Not Quite,"I got started on hunting games with Hunting Unlimited, the first one, and that's a great game. You hunt, you get hunted, every hunt is different. Great prep for real hunting. Then I got HU3, and that's another winner. Has a cool horse, which I got used to in the Trophy Hunter series. On days I can't ride my own horses, I go ride the beautiful maps or chase the animals. Has an ATV, and you can go to Africa -- just watch out for the lions. Now to HU2. It's on foot, limited access on the maps, and a pain to get around. It has bullet-cam, very interesting but the animals don't show up enough. Get HU original and HU3 -- those will knock your socks off. HU2 is only transitional between them. But it has some truly awesome scenery."
1,full of glitches and cheesy graphics,"This software shuts down on me every time I use it. I am running it on Snow Leopard operating system. I am writing this review while I wait for an operation to load on it and hoping it won't crash. The graphics that come with this software are sooo cheesy. I'm talking about terrible cartoon teddy bears and hearts. Nothing the least bit edgy or current.Update: I have since purchased Printfolio. Sooooo much better. It is twice the price but well worth it. User friendly. Great looking, current templates.Belight Printfolio"
3,Disappointing,"I upgraded from the previous version. This version does not show you the size of greeting cards your making (the last one did). Unless you want to take a chance every time when you print don't get this for cards you want to send in the US mail. They also removed the quotations option and still no way to search for graphics. Install does not tell you how to add the ""bonus"" graphics."
2,Not Impressed,"The one feature that I haven't been able to figure out is how to print an envelope the correct size for the card. It's been a nightmare. My old PC software, before I switched to a MacMini let me select the envelope for the card that was created so the size was correct. I've given up on the program. Don't waste your money. If anyone knows how to use the envelope feature I would appreciate some input."
1,Great Product. Description Underwhelming,"The product itself is outstanding. The shipment was prompt. But.....It's deceptive that this product caption reads ""Colors May Vary."" The ad I ordered from did not have that phrase. A silver car was pictured, I selected silver as the color I wanted, but the 2 cars I received were black. On the positive side returning items to Amazon is always easy, with prompt refunds. Thank you."
5,treehouses!,"This is a very informative book with great pictures. It actually gives specs and dimentions in case you want to build your own. But if you don't, it's a beautiful book just to look at and daydream!"
5,Great book,"My 13 yo son loves treehouses and loves to read non-fiction books, so this was the perfect choice for him. I hear ""WOW"" over and over when he is reading this book!"
3,Understand what this book does,"This book is does what its price indicates that it does. The book is about the size of one of the large 5"" x 9"" index cards and is a handy pocket reference for ideas.I used this book to come up with a number of metaphors to explore for a multimedia tourist information system. It did NOT tell me how to build these systems or even state a design list of any type. What it did do was provide a lot of pictures of various systems that I could thumb through and just think about in an open-ended manner.The price for this book is very well aligned with what it does and I enjoy owning it and looking at it. I use other books to design what I think of after looking at this book."
1,General Electric is Craptastic,General Electric Pro-Line miniature lights are absolute crap. Seems like every product I've ever purchased or received as a gift that was made by GE was absolute crap. It's my own fault for buying anything that says GE on the label. I'm old enough to know better.
2,Almost not worth it,"The stuff in this book is something you'd probably find for free on some blog post. I guess the only benefit is that it is already printed out, and you can write on it. Save yourself 10 bucks and just google ""Bass finger exercises""."
5,Brilliant start to the series,"Stephen Greenleaf is one of my favourite writers. He is very similar to Ross MacDonald which is a huge compliment in my opinion. This is hard-boiled private eye writing how it should be done.The lead is John Marshall Tanner, a man with strong principles who takes cases where he can get them, admittedly with a fair degree of self-loathing at times.He is a loner, unlucky with women and sees the seedy side of life too much. The perfect private eye.If I had to differentiate between MacDonald and Greenleaf, I would have to say that the latter uses foul language which while realistic, I think it lowers the tone of the novel a little."
3,HALO lite,"On the plus side, this game has very good graphics and .... wait, that is it. The parts when you drive a tank are fun but that is over too soon. All the action is 95% outdoors and that's okay because the indoors levels looks like they were made in a rush. The missions are unimaginative and repetitive. The voice actors are so horrible that it is funny.I played through it all because I hoped that it would get better. It did not. Its saving grace, it was over soon."
3,Elasto-Gal 6 x 16 therapy wrap,"I like this item, except that I would have liked it to stay cold longer and it was too big for me (small woman). It kept sliding down my leg."
3,Warning: very difficult to read,"My copy of this book just arrived today, so I cannot review its contents thoroughly. However, I am able to register massive initial disappointment. Korean text is not written in hangul, but is romanized. This makes the text extraordinarily difficult to read and will result in the reader making a mental translation into the correct hangul form every time he reads a piece of Korean text in the book. Given the depth and scope of this book, nobody who cannot read hangul will ever use it. I cannot understand why the author should make things so difficult for the reader by romanizing the Korean text. Regardless of what other virtues the book might have (and judging from the contents I am convinced that it has many) I can only give it three stars because the Korean text is romanized."
2,So-So Text,"As an RN with 28 years experience, I was disappointed with the quality of Ms. Friedman's writing. She is overly repetitive with descriptive materials, tends to ramble on, uses slang terms occassionally, and reveals personal bias. There is no place in nursing for unprofessional terms or bias against groups based on religious differences or lack of religious orientation. Positive qualities of this book include adaptation stategies for use in applying nursing theories to families and making appropriate NANDA diagnoses. The Friedman Model is included and well illustrated. Several tables are included and are helpful to clarify wordy text."
3,Not all it's hyped up to be,"Bouncer is and old concepted boxed up in newer graphics. If you like side scrolling fighting/action games this one is for you. It's got good graphics, but they can be a little fuzzy at times. The FMVs are great, but that is what the game mostly is. You fight for a little while and then a long FMV comes on, then you fight a little bit more. Usually no more than 4-5 characters at a time. One cool effect is the ""Trinity Rush"" which allows all three characters to jump one enemy. Each character has their own trinity rush and they're all pretty devestating. Good game to borrow from a friend or rent. Not a must buy."
2,What do you want to do?,"If You want to watch a movie, go to blockbuster, or buy this game. If you want to play a game, then get something else. This is not a game it is a movie. You get to play the parts of the movie that involve fighting. This game..er Movie is short, very short. The graphics are mind blowing, we expect nothing less from Square. This is the reason to get Final Fantasy X instead."
3,Don't buy it....,"This is a game that me and my friends called "" Interactive movie"". When you are playing this game, 70% of the time you don't even need the game pad. Although the graphic is great and the actions of every character is in detail, you can easily beat the game in 45minutes by skipping all the movies."
2,If I wanted to watch a movie...,"...I wouldn't pay $.... Yet, that's exactly what I feel like I bought after playing through Squaresoft's first foray into the land of the PS2. Yes, this game has incredible graphics and wonderful sound, as any movie should. What it lacks, however, is any sort of creativity. I mean, I felt like I was playing Final Fight or Double Dragon again. Square has raised the bar so much with their sparkling RPG's, and it is a shame that this product managed to creep out of the warehouse. Let's hope that Square does better the next time (as I know they will)..."
1,Good graphics but bad game,Just a couple of words to sum it up. Squaresoft is just not trying anymore. Yeah sure the cinimatics are great but all you do is just fight. You watch a movie then just fight. There is not brain skills involved no puzzels to solve and it is not worth buying. Stay away from this one until the price goes down.
4,The best early PS2 game,"The hardcore gamer may reject this game because it is too easy for them or because it is too short, but it is FUN for the average game player. It has great replay value, great graphics, and relatively easy controls. Maybe the acting is bad--but almost all acting is bad on video games. This is a good game to own."
2,Great Graphics That Fall To The WaySide,"To start of with this game has some pretty great graphics, but it stops there. The storyline is interesting but the CGI interruptions are very numerous and take up at least a 1/4 of the story. And to top this all of the story barely lasts over an hour. Squaresoft makes some phenomenal games just look at the Final Fantasy franchise, but this is not anywhere near what I expect of them. If I wanted a fighting game i would get something like Tekken or Bloody Roar. If u like realistic fighting games and fighting/tornament games this is for u. However do not let the promise of a good story game or the Squaresoft label fool u, a Final Fantasy this is most definitely not. To give what positive review I care to, in the whole fighting/tournament genre this is definitely one of the better ones. The fighters look very realistic and the moves do as well. However the premise to this game was the story and boy did it choke!!!!!!!"
2,"Lush graphics but there is something missing, gameplay!","Lets get on with the good things about this movie, great graphics and nice cinemas (hence the two stars and not one star). Now that thats out of the way lets get on with everything wrong about this game. I completed the game in less then a hour, majority of that time was watching very excellent cinemas; but really if I wanted to watch cinemas I would have rented a movie that could go twice as long as this so-called ""movie."" The big problem I have with this game (or movie), is how much time I actually had of playing time. It was very little! Twenty minutes of gameplay is not worth fifty bucks. I suggest you just rent this one."
3,Great game but too short....,"This is a great game - good game play and incredible graphics. I have to give it that. But it lacks replay value and is WAY TOO short.Casual gamers will enjoy it but those of who prefer longer, more detailed games with find it boring and again, very short. I was able to finish the game the first I sat down to play it.Read the other reviews and then rent it before buying it."
5,Narrated by Telly Savalas,"How many VHS tapes can you have that are narrated by Telly Savalas? This ""Stereo"" VHS tape shows the winter (bears, moose elk), geysers ('88 wildfires, eruptions), geology, history, The Lower Falls, The Yellowstone River, mud pots, Grand Tetons; it is approx. 90 minutes. The entire subtitle should be read as: ""The Place Where Hell Bubbled Up & The Grand Tetons""."
4,Guitar fest,"A stunner!Faithful to the Jimi Hendrix tradition Eric Gales displays guitar pyrotechnics with soulful vocals from the Gales brothers;check out the imposing'Paralyzed'and the atmospheric 'Angel of the Night',also the bluesy'God Only Knows'.A diamond in the rough."
3,Gales' second efffort suffers from poor song writing.,"Eric Gales' second effort, despite its characteristic ""attitude"", suffers the same malady afflicting all guitar shredders, from Satriani, Vai and Johnson to Dweezil Zappa and Chris Duarte -- poor songwriting. When your whole act is an excuse for a guitar solo, songwriting and lyrics suffer. Gales' first CD may be his best ever, a shame for a first effort. But he is in good company. (The artist formerly known as) Prince and David Bowie each have had only one great album in their long careers -- Purple Rain and Let's Dance."
2,Meh.... Not really that great,When you purchase the hockey puck style locks you are generally wanting to go the extra mile to secure your property. Although this bracket is fit well to the lock its not made of a substantial material. Would'nt take much to just cut through it with almost anything. Its a pretty soft metal and not a high grade tool steel like you would expect.
2,New to eCommerce? This book MIGHT help...,"Wow...I purchased this book based on the reviews. I was a little put aback by the ""fishies"" on the cover...and with just cause. This book captures the essence of eMarketing at a 5th grade level. If you are looking for a read that will ""get you started down the road to Internet Marketing"", you may get some value out of this publication...if you are a semi-seasoned Internet marketer (or Marketeer), this book lacks substance enough to justify it's price, new or used.After receiving this book, I was honestly shocked at the ""good reviews"" this book has gotten from other readers...the author must have a lot of family and friends."
2,Characters do not come to life,"I only read to p.122, but since there are no negative reviews ...I just did not think Caputo was successful in bringing his characters to life, and thus realizing the potential of his concept. I stopped reading soon after encountering Nordstrom, a self consciously aspiring Nietzschean ""superman"". Yes, I have read and enjoyed Conrad; and Graham Greene."
3,Good for die hard fans,"I'm a huge Edgar Winter fan, and a huge Rick Derringer fan... but this performance seems a bit contrived. The sound and video are good, but both performers strike me as ""going through the motions"" to get another product on the shelves.If you're a die hard fan, definitely go for it. However, if you're new to either of these artists, and want to hear them at their absolute peak, check out ""Roadwork"", which is Edgar Winter's White Trash, featuring Jerry LaCroix and Rick Derringer, with a special appearance from Johnny Winter. This, to my mind, is still the best live album ever recorded. It's a darned shame that it was recorded way too early for video to become feasible, I would have loved to have seen these performances as well as hear them."
4,Some real blues diamonds in the midst,"Save for a few predictable blues dirges, this guy-more specifically, this voice-will put the lead in the pencil of anybody still looking to replace the testosterone gap left in SRV's wake. I dare anyone to play the first track (""Ain't Afraid of Midnight"") in their car full blast, because my guess is that the ink will already be dry on the speeding ticket before the song ends. It's absolute red hot blues and worth the price of admission. Oherwise what does shine, ""Down In the Hole"", ""When the Levee Breaks"", shines very brightly with his raspy vocals (he must gargle with razor blades) and sinister slide rhythyms. Real deal, boys."
5,The best of Bruce's political albums,"This is the first of Bruce's political trilogy from the 80's. Political themes have nearly always been present in his music, but they came front and center in The Trouble With Normal, Stealing Fire, and World of Wonders. Of the three, The Trouble With Normal is the one I return to most often. It has the most consistent song quality of nearly any of his album. Between the cry of the title song (""the trouble with normal is it always gets worse"") to the lament of the conclusion (""and the waves roar on the beach like a squadron of F-16's"") are a great mix of hard rocking songs, Caribbean-influenced music, and slow guitar tunes.No spoken-word numbers, no instrumentals, no overt religious references. Just nine powerful songs that will rock your world if you are reasonably in sync with the politics behind them. Maybe no track is quite as killer as Rocket Launcher from Stealing Fire, but this is the better album."
4,More of the same - which is very good,"After a sabbatical year, De Dijk has made a new album. They still have the blues, what they have produced is actually more of the same thing. Which is, in their case, not a problem at all. On the album are very beautiful songs about life and it's bad sides, about hope and love. A great album by a great Dutch band!"
1,Book was missing pages.,"I purchased this book to do genealogy research on my family tree, and would probably not have noticed any pages missing if I hadn't looked up a specific ancestorthat was supposed to be on pages 309-317. Would still like to have a ""complete"" edition of this book, but am worried about ordering another book wondering if itwould be missing these pages also."
5,Just What I Needed,"Received today & put in my rv to hold a big survival knife & a few smaller Winchester knives.Does the trick,holds strong.Might be a different story when I go down the road,but dont suppose its really made for that anyway.Serves my purpose."
4,the drying process,"i just got this in the mail (used) last night. With pixie records, BAM! they grab you instantly and you're hooked, you just can't and won't let go(pixie fans know this). however with frank black work, the effect is not always the same, for me anyway. it's more like the wine process, good at first, but (with time) the more you listen to it; the greater it becomes. at the beginning of my ""frank black and the catholics"" album i felt a little disappointed.. however, ofcourse, the more i popped it in the more delicious it became. which is what i think will be the case with this one. i have several frank black work already and if you're looking around for reviews on what to get.. let me tell you that; it doesn't matter.. having one will inspire you to get another and so on.. you will have them all. atleast i know i will."
4,Good Solid Information,"Hello All, Review Of The Bearded Dragon Manual; Good solid information, in a easy to follow format. Get the feel that author has been around Beardies for quite some time. Good amount of info for the Bearded Dragon owners beyond the ""beginners"" stage. Overall 4 out 5 stars. Later All..."
4,interesting rhythms,"i was introduced to this album in college when it came in to the radio station (i was a DJ). Apsaras is a japanese group and four of the six songs contain japanese-language vocals; the other two songs are instrumentals. interesting rhythms and melodic sounds abound on this CD. i like to listen to it from time to time, and find the atmosphere this album evokes to be calm and restive, but without being dull or boring. i like to use this album as background music for dinner gatherings, or for listening enjoyment on my drive to work. i highly recommend this album to those with open minds regarding music with non-english vocals."
5,"Really, the last Hurrah","The last contract that James Micheal Curley signed at 2357 before his term as Mayor of Boston ended at midnight has dissapeared from East Boston in a upgrade of Logan International Airport. His son won a Liable award because Frank Skeffington was too much like his father. Most, if not all, of the incedents in ""The Last Hurrah"" could have taken place during the last of James Micheals several terms as Mayor. (Except his death on the night of the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.) Are the politics today better? They are diferent. But I'm not too sure that they are better. The Rules of Engagement are still Us vs. Them, or Top down vs. Bottom up. TV has replaced Ward Politics but little has really changed."
3,Boats to Build,I like the whole CD but I ordered it for one song. And that song is awsome(I Don't Love You Much Do I)
4,definently worth the money,i think that this is a verry nice helmet for larp at first sight i thaught this was ausome and they did a pretty good job replicating the one in the movie the only reseaon it is not 5 stars is that it's not as stiff as it is in the picture so keep that in mind but with a few adjustments it would look perfect so i reccomend this helmet and it is worth the money
1,Never Received Order,Ihave been waiting for 2 months to receive this dvd. I have repeatedly contacted the vendor and requested that they send/resend. I am now requesting a credit to my account. I am extremely disatisfied with the service.
5,WHAT DREAMS ARE REALLY MADE OF,"If I could have only five movies to call my own, CASABLANCA would be my first, or second choice ( VERTIGO, THE APARTMENT, SEVEN SAMURAI, and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN would be the others... ). I don't know whether I've seen this film classic a hundred, or a hundred and fifty times, but it never bores me. This is one of those incredible gems that seemed to have half of Hollywood in it, and a love-triangle that has never been matched. If there is a flaw in it, I have yet to find it. A must for Bogart, or Bergman fans.The print is sharp, and the sound is good. The extras are nice, but not enough to justify the price."
2,not as expected,"It is a LI-40B not a LI-42B and may or may not be compatible with my Olympus X-915 camera.Originally posted as 860MaH,was the reason for the purchase.It is actually 660MaH which is smaller than original battery charge."
5,Album's Dream,"One of the best albums ever, directly from the best times of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. FUll of rage, passion and... hear yourself."
5,the master storyteller,"Nick cave doesnt' need a thousand words, only one, awesome. Henry's Dream is the pivotal work of the master storyteller."
4,Pretty good CD,"Great representation of Desperate Housewives, but probably not a CD for everyone - it's very country heavy. But I enjoyed it! Some of the songs truly made me laugh. (For instance, SheDaisy's God Bless the American Housewife) Overall a worthwhile CD though, I enjoyed it, and the Wisteria Lane track was great."
5,Very bright 9006's,"Before I was used these bulbs I was using Sylvania xtravision 3200k bulbs that were slightly brighter than stock but I wanted more light so I bought these. Cleaned up my headlight from oxidation making then somewhat clear again, installed these Piaa's and WOW it super bright now!!! It has a natural white color that I can see down the road!!!I highly recommend it!!!"
2,Not very good,These bulbs are not as bright as the Silverstar Ultra that I replaced. The distance and pattern of these bulbs are not as good as the SU. I've had them for about 3 weeks and am very disappointed. They are not as advertised and for the high price of these bulbs not a good value at all. The brightness and patterns displayed compare to OE halogen. Don't waste your money!
3,What Else Can Go Wrong?,"The author has combined multiple vacations to Margarita Island into one tale based on true happenings. There are whimsical moments but too much of the story is a collection of pessimistic outlooks and over reactions to vacation mishaps. It's too mellow dramatic for me. I was surprised that they seem to recommend this place. I bought the book hoping to get some insight into Margarita Island but there is little useful information. If you want a short story about what else can go wrong, it's a cute story. If you want to learn something about Margarita Island, look elsewhere."
2,Great packaging. Short on content,"This book is attractive and cleverly packaged but not very helpful in terms of choosing color schemes for the home. I enjoyed flipping through the pages, however, the ""rooms"" are inexpensive sets that do not resemble actual rooms (especially the kitchen section) and the colors combinations are unconventional and unlikely choices. Also, the book refers to only one paint brand, and it is not one of the finer brands on the market. I would not recommend this book as a paint guide."
3,sad,"I really hate it when bands don't achieve the success they would like to, so they keep getting more and more radio friendly. Funeral for a Friend is a very good example. Hours really showed that FFAF was taming their sound. It was still good however. Now with FFAF latest release you'd swear you were listening to a goddamn easy listening album. Where's the double bass kicks? Wheres the signature FFAF guitar complexity?? I could care less about the old screaming that they once did, but the music itself is too damn tame. All the elements that made Funeral For A Friend the great band that I once loved are gone. This album ain't necessarily bad, but its not for me. If you liked their older stuff and expected something along those lines, do not buy this. It's just sad."
2,Wrong sze,The quality of the product was okay but it was overshadowed by the fact that they sent me the wrong size!!!!!
2,comfortable but buyer beware,"I got 2 of these chairs and everyone loves them BUT they don't last and they can be dangerous. The cords that hold the fabric to the frame rot quickly and give out unexpectedly. There have been some injuries due to this. They also rust fairly fast if used outdoors and exposed to rain. Water gets inside the frame and it rusts from inside.Too bag they aren't made better, they are comfortable, but rather awkward to get into them."
5,Loved it!!!,My grandaughter was so excited on Christmas morning. She had this game in past and lost it and this game was one of the only things she asked for. Love it!!!!
5,Rift... The best Phish studio album!!,"A few years ago a friend of mine loaned me a bootleg of Phish show done in 1992 at The Univ. of Calif. Santa Barbara. Many of the songs from that show were from Rift. I was hooked instantly and knew that Phish was a band to get into.After collecting a few tapes of my own I decided to get one of their studio cd's. Rift was my first choice and I was truly impressed with Phish's studio prowess. This cd rocks! If you are new to Phish or are just curious this cd is a great place to start. You wont be disappointed.Highlights include the romping ""Maze"", ""Mound"", ""It's Ice"", ""The Wedge"", ""Rift"", the funny ""Weigh"", and the relaxing ""Fast Enough For You"". ENJOY!!!"
5,Best yet.,"If you've heard a little Phish and want to get more, it's your best bet. This album draws on all kinds of styles from the frenetic, ""Maze"" to the goofy, ""Weigh."" ""Sparkle"" is a kickin' song. If your're more into Phish's pop style (more of a ""Birds of a Feather"" or ""Down with Disease"" sound) you might want to go with Billy Breathes."
4,"OK, now he's back to normal","I haven't written a review in a while, but I'm back and I brought the new Ja Rule album. He went to the formula that he used to get his fame and fortune. And for that, he gets respect. He created his own second act just like Juvenile. The first two singles are hot in their own perspective (Wonderful for the radio, New York for the streets). However, his third single is going to be the breaking point of his career. He better make a good choice. Some of those songs did not need to be on there (Back in Busness, Last of the Mochicans), but overall, production is way better and quality went up a couple of points. 4 starsTop 3 Songs: Wonderful, New York, Life Goes OnBottom 3 Songs: Last..., Bout My Business, What My NameSleeper: Never Thought"
1,Sell for Scrap,"When i picked this up I really thought Ja was back on the come up after the whole 50 situation and with the first 2 singles ""Wonderful"" and ""New York"" i was ready to get this but then i get home and actually listen to the entire cd and thought it was pure garbage i hated it, all i listened to were the 2 singles and nothing else this album was nowhere near a comeback for him and i doubt i'll be buying anything from Ja in the future. Dont Waste your time"
1,Game Over,"Ja is wack he should go back in dissing tracks or kiss 50 ass. Ja'rule is tryin to create beef between jadakiss and 50cent. He is because new york new york is wack. 50cent in an interview said that ja'rule new york was nothing, Ja'rule was tryin to be like i'm from new york i'm tough. He ain tough he get rought by the crack. Who agrees with me that he sucks."
3,Solid,"This is a solid cd with hits such as wonderful,and new york.He comes back hard on this cd after 50 basically ended his career."
2,Just doesnt work out for Ja Rule......,"I skipped his Last temptation cd, but it still seems that he is going downhill from here. Even his catchy song that wore out the radio ""Wonderful"" couldn't save this save this cd from failure. His raspy voice even interferes with his R.kelly hit with his barely to understand vocals and horrible voice. The rest of the cd is not even radio friendly so it wouldn't even work for any other song on the radio and plus there is nothing of substance on the cd to pass as radio other than wonderful and new york. Sorry Ja Rule, the INC is a horrible place to be with non talent singers(Ashanti, Lloyd)more non-talent rappers (Ja Rule the Man of the Hour) and it just dont work out for him. Sorry Ja Rule hopefully it wont be a next time."
1,Ja Rule is gay,"Seriously another rapper another pathetic cd. Wake up and listen to real music! Rap is dead. Someday rap will go the way of disco. I already have several friends who have thrown their rap cds away with a ""What was I thinking?"" and Ja Rule is no exception. Let's seeIntelligent lyrics....NOGood ""singing"".....NOInstrument played by ""artist""....NOI am so sorry I had to ever hear this garbage. If you are older than 6 how can you like this stuff?"
1,Ugly Stick,Yeah 50 Cent has got the magic stick and Ja Rule sure has the ugly stick. He surely got beat with something. LOL!! Look how ugly that man is with his face all boxed up on that album cover. He needs to go get his faced fixed!!!!
1,I heard it's his last...,"The prodigal rhyme biters rhyme bit another rappers style, image & Flow. One of the greatest, the legendary Tupac.Now he comes out with this new garbage before he jets off to the 'big screen' to try & be like his cousin DMX.I heard the album. Same raspy boring flow (Tryna sound hard), trying to come up with catchy hooks about himself, talkin' it up, tryna walk the walk (with crosses on his back), patting himself on the back along the way to make himself think the person he is extorting is alright.I'm sure tupac will not be able to rest in his grave properly until this queer Joho puts the mic down for good.Do yourself a favour & get 'This Week' by Jean Grae or 'Streets Disciple' by Nas (The real QB King) or 'The tipping point' by The Roots. Don't fall into the trap of thinking Ja is cool... he is queer."
5,beautiful!,"I just love this photo album - it looks very professional - I got two of them, for my grandkids. Great value!"
1,Broken Wine Set,"I ordered this Mikasa set as a Christmas present for my wife. Fortunately, I ordered early, but the first package came broken. I sent it back and asked for a replacement set. The replacement came before the big holiday, but the second set was also in shards. The packing in both instances was very lame, and there was no indication on the outside of the box that the content of the box was fragile. Very disappointed, at the service, although the product itself looks very functional, and Mikasa typically makes excellent products."
3,List of songs on this cd,I would like to have a listing of what songs are on this cd/album. Is it only the one?
4,Newly Enlightened!,"Finally a book that spoke to me about me! Eclectic interests and assorted jobs made for interesting job interviews but I dreaded that famous question ""where do you see yourself in five years?"". With exercises and clear examples Mrs. Lobenstine sorts out the benefits of the renaissance soul. Excellent book, well written and accessible. I only wish this had been written sooner!"
3,Good Concept - needs dramtic editing,I am a renaissance soul. I enjoy learning about it. I had it figured out after a few pages. I didn't find much actual help - pretty tedious examples.
3,the music itself was good,"i really licked the music on this album, but i wish they would go back and remaster it though. the sound quality on this album sucked big time. there is alot of distortion that can't be fine tuned out on any stereo system."
4,great deal,terrific book! the boys enjoy reading it and we like multiple stories to choose from.excellent deal.
