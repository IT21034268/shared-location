4,Most gripping battle of the Korean War,"The author's stoic account of the Battle of the Imjim (the envelopment of Gloster Hill) in April, 1951 is must reading for students of the Korean conflict. While he doesn't address the criticism that the Brits weren't well dug in and well deployed for defense, he does portray the human side of battle exceedingly well. The majority of the book deals with his captivity, rather than with the battle itself, but that story of his shuttling from one prison camp to another across North Korea is itself a remarkable story of human endurance"
4,A glorious collection of live VPO performances,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. While it is true that the sound is not up to modern standard, that is not what one buys this set for. The Mitropoulos 9th has the worst sound, but it is an electrifying performance by a master conductor who would be dead within one month. Boehm's Strauss performances are invaluable given his close relationship to the composer, even if they are a bit too swift and objective for my taste. The Karajan Bruckner 8th is excellent, even if it is topped by at least one of his studio sets. I love Andante's documentation, and the sense of history that accompanies these performances. If you have a special interest in the Viennese orchestra style, or any of these conductors, you will love this set."
1,"Dear, oh dear, oh dear","This really was not the sort of thing I was expecting. It was a real mish-mash of very low grade compositions. I actually bought this on tape and therefore the only thing i'm pleased about is the fact I didn't waste any more money on buying it on CD. I've bought all the other WWF cd's and they're very good. This, sadly is not."
5,The Good Ol' Days!,"I've been looking for this for quite awhile, and it was worth the wait. Nostalgic WWF fans will love this. Newer fans (Bandwagon jumpers) will recognize Vince and George Steele...unless they watch WCW. Some songs are cheesy, but that was the basis of '80s wrestling (And it was dang fun!). Among songs ""sung"" by Superstars, the CD contains 3 real entrance themes...""Grab Them Cakes"" (JYD), ""Don't Go Messin' With A Country Boy"" (Hillbilly Jim) and ""Real American"" which THEN was written for Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo although Hulk Hogan later made it famous. Also, there are no lulls in this CD. Between the songs Jesse Ventura, Vince McMahon, and Gene Okerlund intro the songs. A very nice piece of wrestling history and well worth the money."
4,Wishing and Hoping,I found the CD quite impressive...I've been looking online for Piledriver if you remember the second wrestling album with the Demolition song....and Girls in Cars from Strike Force if anyone finds it on CD give me a shout out!
4,"Lets Stroll Down Memory Lane, Shall We?","This CD was one of the first music projects that WWF/WWE had put out and it was a good first effort. Even with this being the first Originals before WWE Originals, it has some themes for Junkyard Dog, Hulk Hogan (both Real American & his early theme), Mean Gene Okerlund, & Hillbilly Jim which makes a must have for theme collectors. For the rest, it was pretty funny to hear Nikolai Volkoff & Rowdy Roddy Piper attempt to sing."
1,wish there was a 0 star rating,"this is the worst clock i have ever had the misfortune to own. the operation and functions are confusing and too much of a hassle to go through. the sound is bad, the functions are worse. we thew it away rather than giving it to someone. save your money and buy something else. sorry, but it's true."
2,Truly incomprehsible controls,"Sure, the nature sounds are nice, but getting them (or anything else) to play is a patience-taxing, button-pushing nightmare. I have a degree in computer science, but it still took me ten minutes of kneeling in front of this damn thing before I could get it to do what I wanted. Too, too many poorly-thought-out and poorly-labelled buttons.Clock radios have been around for long enough that designers should know better by now: Pressing a button labelled ""CD"" should play the CD. Pressing a button labelled ""Forest"" should immediately result in forest sounds. Pressing a button labelled ""Sleep"" should immediately display a countdown timer...One last thing: All clock radios should have the option of sounding like an alarm clock."
1,Bad product,"On my Timex T600B the CD player would not work after about 12 months. The disc would start spinning and then just stop, and I did not use the CD that much during the time I had this product so was not real happy that it failed. I tried everything to get it to work - and it was not the seating of the disc I had in there. Also, I agree with other reviewers also that the nature sounds are noticeably repeating over a very short duration. I ended up just getting rid of this entire contraption. Initially I replaced it with an iHome clock radio where I could dock my iPhone, but that was rubbish as well. I got rid of both the iHome clock radio and the iPhone. I have now found the perfect solution to nature sounds (white noise makers) and replaced it with my android smartphone at night. My smartphone charges while I sleep and there are a few really good White Noise applications in the app markets that go light years above and beyond the nature sounds you hear on this clock radio."
4,Cute and fun!,"A colorful and whimsical book that'll appeal to fashionistas and cat lovers. Cute illustrations and fun rhymes make for a sweet and clever read that's not just for kids. Love the illustrations -- stylized and sophisticated, not too cutesy-wutesy."
4,Feasted On: The Billionaire's Pregnant Mistress by Lucy Monroe,"4 out of 5 stars!! Charming and enjoyable from beginning to end!!! The relationship between the main characters is palpable, they have such duty to their families that when all these things hit them at once they don't know how to behave so they do anything to find the control they both loose instantly. I enjoyed reading about such passionate and prideful people ... as soon as I started the story I didn't want to put it down!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
2,Did I read the same book?,"I thought the hero a boor who wanted everything his way. He's keeping a mistress even though he plans to marry another woman?!?! It seems lately all I've read in romances are about women whose only attraction is their beauty. The men are all FABULOUSLY wealthy but with no depth of character. Poor as I may be, I cannot seriously see myself attracted to a man who couldn't hold an intelligent conversation - no matter how great the sex. And I so wanted to like this book because of the previous reviews. Very disappointed."
3,So far so good,We bought these chairs to replace the chairs that came with the 50 year old dining room set. The original chairs are in pieces in the workshop and company was coming. They look nice with the cherry set and held up to kids so far.I bought 6 chairs and 2 arm chairs. Got it down to a science putting them together but the second box.
5,Demonstrates the presence of a divine creator,"Richard's book very aptly presents the absurdity that the many wonders of creation just happened by chance. His presentation of material shows great research and sound logic. To the one who stated his mathematical calculations of flipping 10 coins. He was calculating the probability that all ten coins would come up heads. His calculation was mathematically correct. If you do your homework, you will see that his facts are correct."
1,Don't buy one!,I bought one of these and tried it in three pc's. It did not work on any of them! Stay away!!!
2,Just Go Away,"Very tedious read....probably my mistake in picking this particular book...I'm sure the content was great for some...but it did not speak to me....was quite ""text-booky"".....better luck next time!"
2,"Great game, not for amateurs","My son gave me this game for Christmas and unlike the prior version, I cannot come close to surviving even a few minutes at any level above easy. I've gone back to my Dawn of War that I can sometimes beat. I recommend this only for VERY experienced players or people willing to devote a great deal of time into figuring out how to stay alive more than 5 minutes."
2,Not worth buying,"If you already own the other two Dawn of War games, it is not worth buying this one. I purchase expansion packs because I want to expand on the story, not to play a generic risk type game. I expected to find a story based campign and was very disappointed. What a waste of $30. After playing the same battlefield 3 times I was bored!I have never played DOW online, but I guess if two more races are important to you, then it might be worth buying."
4,A good addition with a few perks,"The gameplay itself doesn't change much except with the addition of the two new races. They, themselves, offer a whole range of new challenges and opportunities to find new ways to kill your friends on multiplayer (takes a while to get used to the Necrons though)The new campaign is a nice addition that was def. lacking in Winter Assault. It will provide a good solid 10 hours of battles and interesting storyline, but in the end the multiplayer aspect is really where DoW shines."
3,Great clock; awkward alarm,"This clock works great for me; the time is accurate and the signal reception is good (in Cupertino, CA). As a clock it is troublefree. As an alarm it's not so great; the buttons are really clunky and require a lot of force to operate, except for the set button in back which is way too easy to press when picking up the clock. There are dual alarms, each using a simple loud beep that beeps faster until you turn it off. Amazingly, there is no snooze function. My clock arrived with two AA batteries (""not included"") already installed; perhaps it was a return unit - but it seems to be in new condition."
2,Not much information,Being the brother of convicted co-conspirator Terrry Nichols does not give the author any inside info on the bombing. Terry was able to tell him very little about the plot while being visited in jail. This is only about the FBI's high-handed investigation of the author due to his relationship to Terry. Not relevant to the main event. I wish I hadn't bought it.
5,THIS TOY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this toy. when u put it in water i magicly swims by itself. You can put this in a large fish tank, pond, bath tub, swimming pool and anything else the has water. I would recommend this item to anyone."
5,I love Karen Winnick's Books!,"They are a delight to read. The illustrations charm me and all of the many children in my life (including a set of six-year-old triplets.) I love reading the books aloud and watching the chldren get excited by Ms. Winnick's heroic characters. Sybil's Night Ride is my favorite so far. Sybil is a brave and smart role model and the story is a wonderful adventure. Thank you, Karen Winnick. Keep writing and congratulations on another delicious read for kids (and me... their aunt.) Iris Rainer Dart"
5,Karen Winnick - visual and textual perfection,"Karen Winnick's Sybil's Night Ride is the children's book every parent should obtain for the soul purpose of giving the best of children's literature and illustration to his or her child or pre-adolescent. Karen Winnick skillfully masters the historical story of Sybil Ludington and transcends it into a captivating 20 or so pages of beautiful words and detailed oil paints, the likes of which I have only seen in such genius as Van Gogh or Monet. This is a must, a bestseller, a joy. Also, look for Mr. Lincoln's Whiskers, the perfect complement."
2,Look Elsewhere,Within the 1st few weeks of owning the phone the cordless battery needed to be replaced. A few months later the cordless earpiece stopped producing sound. I've bought numerous $20 or less portables that are tougher and a better value. The base unit is fine but does nothing extraordinary that you can't get for less elsewhere.
5,Good basic buy,"I wanted a basic desktop phone without a lot of bells and whistles. Basic directory, speaker, mute, for home office. It has all these basic features with a portable handset as a bonus for a great price. Those listening to me on speaker say it is very clear, no static. Highly recommended for a basic home office phone."
2,bland,"I've had this book for a few years now and don't think I've made more than one or two recipes out of it. It does have some reasonably good information in some of the side bars, but the recipes themselves just don't seem to have a lot of oomph to them. Usually, they contain just a few ingredients. Lots of color pictures would have added much to the book. Guess I will have to find a new home for it."
5,Do you like Romance and Fun ? Then watch the Movie,"Absolutely funny, and a clever plot with a touch of Romance. A good recipe for a good Romantic Comedy.A charm, you won't regret watching this movie with your friends and loved ones."
2,by the numbers,"This film has all the typical elements of its genre, which I won't list here, and as such felt formulaic. I do have to at least say that the nerdy roommate thing is so old and tired, it creaks, and the thing with the animals was totally unnecessary and irrelevant-- just something to keep the guys awake, I guess. What annoyed the heck out of me: Matthew McConnaghey's teeth are so preternaturally white that their blinding chalkiness distracted me every time he opened his mouth. I can't understand why everyone interviewed in the special features kept talking about him as if he is the most irrefutably gorgeous thing they've ever laid eyes on, when he's about as truly humanly sexy as a Ken doll. What I enjoyed: This was partly filmed on Maryland's Eastern Shore, in a town (and a particular restaurant) that I am familiar with, so that was fun to see."
3,NOT A COMPLETE FAILURE!,"This movie gets by because it has a very good cast. The laughs are far and few between, but it is a watchable movie. It's fairly fast paced with some cheap laughs along the way but, I thought this movie would be much better than it turned out to be. In the end, it's a decent but forgettable romantic comedy that's worth a rental."
3,Funny,"OK here's the thing. I saw this 3 times in the theaters. I went back because the supporting players are so funny and really, in my mind, they steal this movie. To me there isn't a lot of ""chemistry"" between Matthew and Sarah Jessica but they are both good. However the people that will really make you laugh are their friends and Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Matthew's parents. Who would ever believe those two would be married to each other but they pull it off and it IS believable and funny. I found it funnier in the theater than at home, but that's just my experience. If you are seeing it for the first time, just sit back and be prepared to laugh."
2,"Empty people, empty movie. Don't waste your time","Life is short. Time is precious. Much too precious to waste on a vapid movie like this one, peopled with shallow, despicable characters. Trust me. Watching this was torture. Couldn't agree more that there is less-than-zero chemistry between SJP and MM in this.Blah!"
2,"Stupid movie, cool side character","I saw this movie on a plane...I wish there had been snakes on the plane so they would have had to turn off the movie to deal with the snakes or something like that. It's so stupid and cliche, with dumb characters, stupid dialouge and most eye-rolling to me was that the ending seemed to try to make the movie a grand production...as if we were all caring about what happened to the couple...I didn't care one bit, I just wanted the plane to land so I could take a nap (it's hard for me to sleep on planes, I am 6'3"" and so my best bet is to get a window seat and turn my body a tiny bit sideways and let my head rest against the wall/window of the plane). So, that's it, stupid movie, but still better than Robocop 2...much better."
1,OK But Whatever,"This could have gone further......the idea if him with a minorityfiance' years prior from the ghetto, now dead, is absoutely wrecklace script-writing at it's ultimate stupidity.....MM should have declinedthe script until rewritten. Period."
1,Truly Terrible,"Wow, that movie was so bad that I had to fast forward many times just to get through it. I didn't know a movie with such hot actors could be so terrible. It gives chic flicks a truly bad name. Ugh."
1,Succeeded at launching my lunch,"Pampered and pretty. Pukey and petite. This stinky movie is worse than my feet.If you can take a hint, you will suspect that I didn't like this movie."
2,Basically a cartoon,"No one in this romantic comedy vehicle rings the slightest bit true. All are cartoonish figures, as is the premise of a 30 something guy who can't move out of his parents' house. At least the upscale interiors are fun to look at. McConaughey's teeth are unnaturally white, which is also annoying. One does get the feeling his character is closest to him in real life, given his gallivanting with buddy Lance Armstrong. I didn't laugh at anything here, but at least it moves along at a relatively brisk pace."
3,Investigating Computer-Related Crime,This book is not very exciting nor does it have technical advice that can be installed into a system that is lacking. This book is a compilation of facts that are very basic. Those searching for answers computer crime will not find this very helpful.
2,Not very practical,"This seemed like a slick new product, and couldn't be easier to install. Problem is ... it doesn't do the job at all. I needed working lights on the countertops during the day, and mood lighting at night. The LED lights provided zero visible light during daylight. I was willing to settle for just night accent lighting - but they didn't fill that bill either. They gave off a weak white glow, that got even dimmer as the batteries aged. To top it off - the stick-up tape began to fail after several days. They fell completely off in a week. I wised up and bought plug-in XENON bulb lights at Home Depot. That turned out to be a beautiful and effective solution for under cabinet lighting. The light is warm, bright, and dimmable for a great evening look."
2,If he didn't love it so much it would be in the trash!,"My two year old loves this toy , but I can't stand it. After two days of putting it back together every 5 minutes I decided to super glue it together. That's actually made it a much better toy, except that the lift for the train comes off it's tracks ever second or third time he uses it. All in all, I think it's a waste of money, but my son would be devastated if we tossed it."
2,Great while it works!,"When I first got this phone equipment, I was delighted. It lasted about six months before fizzling out on me. The speaker phone on the base unit worked fine at first. Now callers tell me it sounds as though I'm in a dance hall ... a dance hall with lousy acoustics. The buttons on one of the hand units don't always work. I punch in a number, only to find that I have to do it all over because one or two of the digits didn't register. Now, one of the units won't recharge properly when seated in its base.What a waste of money."
2,Does not work properly,I bought this phone because I live in Japan and most cordless phones are off-limits. I found this in the Base Exchange and was excited. A cordless we are allowed to use. My first problem was the charger would not work so I began charging the bateries in the base unit. Then the memory button does not work. I have a difficult time accessing the memory button and the off button. Because I am using the base unit to charge the bateries the batery pack is now loose and the phone often will not work even with a full charge. It blacks out when I set it down. I have been very disapointed in this product and would advise every one to NOT buy it. It is too expensive to only get 5 good months of use out of.
1,Pass on this one,"I have been a long-time fan of W.E.B. Griffin for many years. Having read everything he has published, I can say without a doubt that this one is a pass. The story line moved agonizingly slowly, was dull, and frankly, without the name of the author I would have just stopped reading it. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did."
4,Back to the REAL series,"W. E. B. Griffin has returned to his REAL series, ""The Brotherhood of War"". Had he to do it all over again, I'm sure he would have slowed down the pace at which he went through World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, to stretch it out longer. But this is a return to the REAL characters -- the real Craig Lowell, rather than the millionaire-playboy clones who people THE CORPS, and the other Griffin series.SPECIAL OPS is good and authentic (down to the parking sticker color for an enlisted man's POV, and the hassle required to change it.My only criticisms: it goes on about 150 pages too long, Argentina AGAIN, and no Rudy MacMillan."
3,I'm so confussed,I have been reading Griffin for the past 8 years and never been disappointed until now. I loved these characters in the other books in the Brotherhood series. I could not get into his rhythm and train of thought. Just as I was getting into the character and scenario he jumped to another place and person only to be there a couple of seconds and off you go again. If this were a movie I would have been sea sick. Griffin has been one of the few writers I could read over and over but not this one. I am glad I got it rom the library.
2,An afterthought shadow to the original series.,"I have read and loved the Brotherhood of War for over 20 years. This book simply doesn't measure up. The end of the book is simply one teletext message after another advancing the story, but capturing none of the drama or emotion. In this style, the story of Goldilocks would read: ""A lost little girl broke into the home of three bears and used up or broke some of their stuff. The bears came home and ran her off. The End.""It's a pity, really. Each time I reread the other novels, it's like visiting old friends. This one is like reading about them in a newspaper article."
1,Bent in half,I pulled out my new over-the-door hanger to hang clothes on to pack for a week long trip. I had 6 pairs of slacks or jeans and 4 tops hung on it ---- and the thing bent in half!!!!! I have owned another one for 30 years that holds many more clothes waiting to be ironed. I am going to see if I can either return it or have it replaced!
2,DESIGN FLAW,Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I loved the design butunfortunately it had a design flaw for my purposes and we had to returnthem.
2,Caused an infinite loop on XP Pro.,"Good product if it would work. Installed on a Dell Inspiron 4000 running XP Pro. On the first re-boot the device driver (ATi2dvai) caused an infinite loop. After an hour of re-boots I was finally able to get in to safe mode and see the 5 other error messages (video compatability problems, AW_HOST.sys had to be disabled, WINAW32.exe no functioning.....) Ended up having to restore back to two weeks ago. This is a good product if you don't mind a slow connection and are NOT running XP. If you are running XP or plan to in the future wait for a new version to come out before buying pcAnywhere"
1,Mediocrity at its best,"If you like good music, Marco Antonio Solís is not an option. The lyrics of his songs are lame and shallow. You can easily identify his songs since the tune is very similar. He has nothing new to offer, his best period was about 20 years ago, when he wrote grupero songs like ""Los alambrados"", ""Busco una compañera"" and ""Mi najayita"". If you want to listen good Spanish music, buy Silvio Rodriguez, Pablo Milanés, Nek (he's italian), Juan Gabriel, Miguel Bosé, Aleks Syntek."
2,Author falls short of his goal,"The title of this book looks promising to readers who are interested in studying interpersonal psychology, and the book claims in particular to deal with the effects that previous abuse can have on a relationship. But the author falls far short of his stated goals. The pages are sparsely gilded with common-sense pop psychology, and these ""discoveries"" are ""supported"" by contemporary cases from the media; only a handful of cases are recycled throughout the book. Plenty of quality books exist on this book's alleged subject; seek out those books and don't bother with this lightweight."
3,Unnecessary,"You don't need this if you just remove the sink flange from your old disposal and install the one provided with the Waste King disposal. It is simple enough to do and the Waste King flange comes with a little rubber gasket so you don't need plumber's putty, but maybe that was just for stainless sinks."
1,Waste King Adapter kit not needed,"I ordered the Waste King 2600 disposer. Based on the Amazon recommendation I also ordered the Waste King 3101 ISE Adapter kit, thinking it was required to installl the disposer. This kit is not needed to install the disposer as all the needed hardware comes with the Disposer. Just wasted $$ on the kit."
5,BEST MONITOR THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED.,"The Absolute Best of a dying breed. I am a gamer / graphic designer. I have owned one of there babes for about 4 or 5 years now, and I must say they just don't make quality like this anymore. Very easy on the eyes. I get a mygrane after an hour looking at the new tech screens. I just dropped about $280 on a semi high end ASUS 24in widescreen 1080HD LED/LCD bla-bla monitor becasue my wife's been nagging me for years for her desk space back and now I can say with certainty that LCD flat panels are just not to the same level as these older monitors. If you have one of these just keep using it and maybe new tech will catch up someday soon."
5,WOW,"I've been sleepin on him for a minute now. I copped this awhile back and never really listened to much of it. I was missin out. I went to his show last night, he opened up for the GOD (RAKIM) and he killed it. So ever since then I've been playin his record and it takes me right back to his ill performance I witnessed a night before. Heads should really check him out I really think you'll enjoy it."
2,Very disappointing,"I read this book because it was so highly recommended by so many people, but I found the actual product unsatisfying. It's got a great premise and could have been heart-wrenching and exciting, but it just ended up dumb, in my opinion. The main characters were just irritating. I found Sarah a totally unrealistic heroine, and when she finally ended up offering to be the guy's mistress, after all the jabbering on and on about her reputation, I thought, ""You are just an idiot."" The hero was fairly unsympathetic. The book could have said more about his mother and his relationship with her, and showed you more a glimpse of his heart, instead of going on and on about dragons. I felt totally uninvested in this story, and it's a shame because it could have been such a good one. The scene in which they finally ""made love"" was as stupid as any I've ever read in a romance novel."
5,"Nice Pics -Good Book = rich is utterly, utterly hopeless","I just sat down and read this book in one sitting. Peter Lance is a wizard of the word, inticing and thrilling readers with all the juicy details of the survivor mess. The artist ZEEBARF is incredible, imaginative and boarder line genius! Overall this book presents Richard in his true form - as a totally and utterly dellusional individual. Furthermore questions are exposed about the ethics of this 'reality'series. Overall, it's very well done. Buy yourself a copy, and thank God your not like Rich Hatch."
1,Outdated and bad for n00bs,"This book is so often the first one handed to a neophyte or seeker. This is a problem, because if you read it as some one brand new to the idea of the occult, you will think every headache, every moment of doubt, and that time when you were drunk you fell over a lot, was a psychic attack.I personally don't mind the book as a historical document. But given the neopagan and occult community is rife with drama queens who will shout ""are you threatening me with magic"" if you accidentally leave a bone from KFC on your plate pointed at them, it does more harm than good. Again for those not particularly versed in levels of threat, response, or sad to say this, REALITY.Read it with an open mind, but understand it comes from another age, and another mind set."
1,bad,"this book is very outdated,well what can one expect since it was written 1930. her views on witches are awful,though i do admit she didnt call us satanworshippers. this book might be good for those interested in christian mystics. and she seems to be antifemale,i always laugh at females that arent antifemale. i dont reccomended this book at all,it was awful."
3,Good fit,"Looks good, fits ok, easy on the nose. If you plan to buy online, you should know your vision measurement first otherwise its a waste."
5,Works just fine,"This toaster does just what you want it to - it toasts bread properly. We considered a much more expensive toaster when we bought this, but we're glad we bought this one. We've had it a year or two and have had no problems."
1,This may be the WORST toaster I have ever used.,"We have several of these toasters at work. They are a disaster. The worst part is that they are S-L-O-W. I mean glacier slow. If this toaster was any slower you would need to start your morning toast the night before. Of course even that wouldn't work since you often need to press the lever several times to get the toast done even on the darkest setting.This is true for all three of these we have at work, so I know we didn't just get a clunker.There are also other problems. The toast lift feature does not lift the toast high enough. the toasting is uneven.I hate this toaster and you will too."
2,"All in all, an ugly little movie","This movie has a top-notch cast. Natasha Lyonne is absolutely wonderful as the big-breasted teenager. It's very hard to like any of the characters, though, and most of them are downright obnoxious. This is certainly not a date movie.Most of the little stories aren't very believable, so it's hard to take this movie seriously as a drama and it's definitely not funny. All in all, an ugly little movie."
2,Slums of silliness.,"Slums of Beverly Hills had all the potential to be a great indie flick but to my chargin, I couldn't relate or tolerate any of the characters. Natasha Lyonne is an unique actress but even her talent can't save this uneven and boring film. Alan Arkin and Marisa Tomei also try to make this dud into something great but after awhile you can't stand how their characters are so inane and pathetic. Slums... is a critics darling and I can't figure out why?"
1,Don't Buy,"Stopped working after 2 months, tried replacing battery which did not solve the issue. I do not recommend buying this Made in China product."
3,Scale works great but updated rate chart impossible to find,"Royal's ds3 scale works great for checking the weight of your outgoing mail and to help you calculate the correct postage with a handy chart. The hold button makes it easy to keep the weight displayed even after you take the package off the scale.My only real complaint is that the packaging promises you access to updated charts on their website. After countless hours searching for it, and their horrible customer service contact form where I never got a response back I ended up going to the US postal web site and printing out my own form. Too bad Royal can't keep their end of the bargain by posting new rate charts for customers to print out on their web site.[Update 8/19/09 - Royal has posted the updated postage charts on their website. See comments below for the URL.]"
3,Late Delivery,I ordered this NEC monitor on 6th October when the scheduled shipping was within a few days. - I am still waiting after five weeks. Amazon kept on shifting the shipping / delivery days. Regretable that Amazon is resorting to this kind of false expectation.
4,Thrill Ride,"This movie is defiantly worth checking out. Flannery and Pantoliaon work well together. Suspense through the whole movie, and a killer ending."
4,A husband who wants to reconnect with his roots,My husband wanted to have this book and actually he likes it because he wanted to reconnect with his roots. He is learning fast sentences and unusual words. It's easy understanding book for this difficult language.
2,String,"I've used different kinds of yo-yo string. Enough to tell you this string doesn't last long. It spins and twists so much that soon, it doesn't work to well. If you are an intermediate, like myself, do not buy it.With doing tricks like the trapize and the double or nothing, this string will get tangled and make your sight off."
1,Avoid Introduction to Topology by Baker,"This books is terrible. There is no answers in the book! You have no way of knowing if you are doing the problems right or not. Also, the examples are too brief and don't explain what steps or theorems that they used. I am buying another book just to figure out what this book is talking about."
4,Becoming a Prayer Warrior: A Guide to Effective and Powerful Prayer,An encouraging message on drawing close to God! Looking up the scripture adds to the realativity of the message. Keep a notebook handy as you read.
4,A Classic,This book by Beth Alves is a classic on prayer. She is widely recognized as one of the foremost authorities on prayer. Check this one out today!
5,Becoming a Prayer Warrior,"This book on prayer is the best I've encountered. Very concrete teaching and examples are very helpful. Many books on prayer are less specific, more vague. Deals with many varied areas of prayer, making it a book you want to reference repeatedly. I'd originally read a book loaned by a friend, but realized I wanted a copy of my own for reference. Very helpful for everyone from prayer newbies to more experienced prayer teams."
1,cd does not work,Been buying cds most of my life. First time I purchased one that does not work.It does not play. Just rejects right out of the computer.Made by Orange Mountain Music....
4,does the job,"I am pleased I bought this. It worked great and saved me lots of $ A regular chimney sweep charges over $100 and for the price, I got a grand deal. It was easy to use and swept my chimney clean in one swoop. Well worth it."
5,Great Compass,"Like all Brunton products I own, this is a top notch quality product. I have taken two Search and Rescue tests with it and passed with flying colors. Our state Search and Rescue coordinator recommended this compass as is it the one he has been using in the field for years...so far it has proven itself to be very reliable when used correctly. Just make sure you read and understand the directions and know how a compass works...don't get lost first and then try to figure it out. Play with it in familiar territory with familiar landmarks and an accurate map."
4,Top Choice for Pros and Enthusiasts Alike,"If your looking for an accurate and fairly easy field compass to use, the Brunton 8099 Pro Eclipse Compass is a great choice. As an outdoor enthusiast, I don't go out to the wilderness without the Brunton 8099. I routinely go Geocaching with my GSPr, map and compass. This compass is a great companion to any GPS. Features like determining inclination come in handy when deciding on creating a track or trail through normally uncharted areas. The only thing I found rather useless is the leveling bubble which was difficult to accurately hold in place when taking a reading. The included reference cards are very useful and this compass is designed for accurate readings down to one degree. With practice any novice can become adepted at taking extremely accurate bearings and calculating heights and inclinations. It's also sleek and well protected."
4,A great compass,"I purchased this compass for geologic field work. I have a Brunton Transit which I have had many hours of use. The 8099 is a good multipurpose instrument but it is not a real replacement to the Transit. The Clinometer is useful but the reasonably accurate with practice. Would I give up the Transit,? No but the 8099 is a nice back up in the field or for student use. You can do serious work with it If you know the limitations. It is really important to read the manual before using it. The reference cards are nice but I would like to see them made of plastic not paper."
2,Incomplete with NO illustrations,I ordered the paperback and the whole book refers to illustrations that are not in the book. There are No illustrations whatsoever! In small print in the 2nd page of the book says you can go to a website for the illustrations. They should tell you this before you order. If I wanted to download the book and read on my computer I would have done that in the first place.Let people know the facts before they order an incomplete book. The paperback has 83 pages while the download has over 200 pages.
5,Illuminating...,Rodell's insights into the methods and principles underlying Yang style taijiquan form a powerful guide for practitioners of all levels.
4,"Great tv, great price","Of the four generations of Sharp Aquos HD televisions, this is the third generation and the first to actually get the picture right. Yea, you can spend more on the latest and greatest, but with the full 1080p that this tv gives you, you WILL NOT be regretting this purchase.And on top of that, you save a ton of money getting it here than at say a best buy. I was a little weary as a first time amazon customer for a big purchase, but everything worked out great."
5,Good quality.,Bought for my drummer sin. He uses these to travel to his band gigs. He loves them. Says hey do a great job of protecting.
1,"Lackey wrote it, not Cherryh.","Mercedes Lackey actually wrote the text of this book, not CJ Cherryh. If you are a Cherryh fan, you will probably not like it. It takes good basic plot and wordbuilding and ruins them with plebeian writing and puerile ideas, typical of Lackey's work."
1,Not good...,"I'm always open to new bands, or new sounds. I got this CD free in some radio giveaway at Michigan State University. I listened to it all the way through, and didn't enjoy any of it. The vocals are not good, the guitar seems to be way to far off rhythym to even be called experimental or post-hardcore, and there are no songs that even stick out in my mind. If you get the CD free like I did, cool, but don't waste your money."
2,mediocre,"Mediocre in every way - content, organization, and currency. Henkin's two-volume Nuclear Medicine superbly covers this material and much more (albeit at a higher price). Need a less expensive book that covers only Nuc Cardio? Try Iskandrian."
1,Did not work,"I ordered this memory card new for the ps1 games I had. It was not new, as stated, no packaging and it did not work. will never order anything from this vender or amazon again. i feel i was taken."
1,Corrupted,"I have a PlayStation 2 and this memory card did not work with my console. It would let me save but whenever I reset and tried to reload the saved game, it would say the file was corrupted and asked to reformat it. Once it reformatted, the data was lost."
1,Doesn't work.,"Product does not work. An error message comes up every time I try to save. Just buy a Sony memory card, and don't mess with this."
5,Thanks for the memories!,"I miss my childhood so much, so I just had to have a ps1 memory card, and i was even able to get the actual console, so many memories so little time! But this little guy is going through it all with me! Thank you!"
5,Happy,I received this product super fast. It was in perfect shape and brand new just like it said it was. Great value also!
3,"Good for novices, but too slow for those looking for a workout","My husband purchased this for me as a gift during my 3rd trimester. I had been practicing prenatal yoga from a book roughly 3-4 times a week throughout my pregnancy. He thought the dvd would eliminate the need to constantly refer to the book in the middle of my practice. I think the dvd was thoughtfully put together and is a great for those just starting yoga while pregnant. The instructor provides good direction and offers modifications to poses that may be too difficult. The pace of the practice is super slow. Personally, I found the whole dvd to be elementary and boring. Upon completion of the dvd, I was expecting to feel like I had a good workout instead it felt like I had taken a sedative. Bottom line: great for beginners, skip it if you have any yoga experience."
1,"Awful, awful monitor","After reading lots of online reviews for this monitor, I bought one a year ago and I have to say that it is the worst monitor I've ever had.It had to go back to NEC twice within the first 4 months, once for a colour problem (no red if I remember correctly) and the second time to fix bad focusing (which wasn't really fixed to my satisfaction).Good monitor for gaming, bad bad bad for text, the focus is terrible in some areas of the screen. To cap it all, text has just started shimmering and I fear that the tube is on the way out.All in all, I would say that according to reviews its the best CRT out there, in my experience it's awful, do yourself a favour and buy a Samsung SM913N 19"" LCD instead."
5,Perfect for the schleich horses,"Awesome set, comes with a bridle, halter, saddle, blanket, and rider. It fits the schleich horses perfectly. The blanket is blue plaid and is a really great addition to my schleich horse set-up."
3,Mixed bag.,"Deep Cuts, the first of the two discs included in this two-for, is actually a pretty good album. As of the release of Ghosts, the Strawbs began developing more along the lines of prog-pop than prog-folk/rock. Where not as strong as Ghosts or the follow up recording, Nomadness, Deep Cuts is along those lines but with a harder sound. The band is solid, and the songs, for the most part, are as well. The second disc, Burning for You, is really quite a weak recording. In fact, at this point the Strawbs were finished. In an effort to attempt to stay relevant to the sound of the times they lost that which made them original and ended up sounding like a second rate power pop band. It's a shame really as they had put together a rather impressive catolog of material that still holds up well to this day. Beginners should start with Hero and Heroine, Ghosts, Bursting at the Seams, and Grave New World. Nomadness, is unfortunately unavailable at this writing as it too is worth obtaining....Simon"
1,Advertisement not Objective,"This book did not provide any information that was useful in making a decision. It breifly described the resorts, restraunts, and theme parks, but never made a recommendation. I am planning a trip to Disney World in 2003. We do not have kids, and wanted to plan a trip geared towards adults without kids. This book did not give a single recommendation to help with the planning."
2,Reads like a first grade primer,"I like Hanna's Daughters and was looking forward to reading this one, but her choppy, unimaginative style of writing left me wondering if she was hurting for money. I found the development of the friendship between the two women and their children to be forced and unrealistic in the period of time she was covering ( about a year?) The emotions seemed exagerated. The sentence structure typically resembled what one might find in a grade school primer. I'm wondering if perhaps this is a result of it being translated from Swedish to English. At any rate, not a pleasant read, fortunately it was very short."
3,Where's Bugs Bunny?,"I was very disappointed in this Spotlight Collection in that it only had three Bugs Bunny cartoons. The second disc was full of war time cartoons and corny Merrie Melodies. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Merrie Melodies, but it just seemed overkill to me. Also, the war time cartoons could have been ones with Bugs, Porky, Daffy, and others. I skipped through at least 4 cartoons on disc 2. And why include ""bonus"" cartoons when they could've just included them with the regular list. And where's Yosemite Sam? For me, this was a weak collection. :("
2,Terrible,"SPOLIERS! I sincerely felt for the heroine's character, but I have to say that after 9 years... the anti-men mantra went on way too long. She was blatantly rude to the hero of the story on several occasions. I wasn't too happy with him either, as he cheated on his best childhood friend (girlfriend) with the heroine rather than breaking it off with her before he began pursuing the new flame. The story line was solid, but the characters were annoying and really had little ""character"". Disappointing."
1,Yuck,"I ordered this confusing it with the Hawaiian Breeze Febreeze brand of products (embarrassingly) and wound up with a pack of 12 of these. Having never smelled them before, I decided to try it out.Worst mistake I made-- I should have returned it without opening the box. If only I had known.The scent was sickly chemically fruity sweet, as though it were super pungent tropical jello or something similar. Even on the lowest setting I couldn't stand it. It actually gave me headaches, which some scents do."
3,mediocre,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but this dvd was okay, that's the best I can say. It would have been nice to see an acoustic set."
4,McGuire and McDonald,"THis famous fighter group had in its ranks, amongst others, aces Tommy McGuire (38 kills) and Charles McDonald (27 kills). In Pacific, the pilots had not a predetermined number of combat hours before leaving. That's why McGuire was killed: he was just plain tired, after 270 missions in roll."
1,I don't get it.,"""... it is amazing how the best relationship can keep a client, even if the work is far from the best.""How good can the relationship possibly be if the client is getting work that is ""far from the best""?And why on Earth should a client stay with an agency that is delivering work that is ""far from the best""???"
1,Stop reading Brain Surgery & start reading Ad Age.,"... This book doesn't present the fundamentals of world class account service, so I'd start with Ad Age instead.Executive recruiters would be wise not to share this book with would-be account people so they don't scare them off."
1,"""56 Things Every Account Person Already Knows""","Get to know your client, always think about what they do & how you can improve that, work on the relationship..... this is all painfully obvious advice."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g,Pass on this one. Nothing new here and badly written as well. And the swarmy introduction is even worse. No wonder direct mail has a poor reputation.
5,Made for Macbook,"This is an excellent product and fits macbook better than any other case available in market. I roamed around each and every store,bought a targus case & returned it as I was not satisfied .I bought this one and I am really happy I could find the right case on amazon.Pros:Light weightExcellent padding to protect your laptopExecutive look with leather finishCons:Fits only the macbook and the adapter. Not for people who want to carry other accessories like Mouse/external hardrive.I will surely recommend this notebookcase to every one who owns a macbook."
1,Do not buy this item.,I highly recommend you not to buy this as this doesnt have any extra storage space.Even power adapter case is quite snuggly and I am repenting buying this item. I cant even store my ipod in this case. The finishing of the product is smooth and leather quality is descent.But its not multipurpose.
2,Disappointing and Moderately Chauvinist,"I generally like Sheffield, but this was a disappointment. He had absolutely no grasp of female reproductive biology on the fifth-grade level--which was not what the book was primarily about, but it was distracting. He also lifted the attitudes of an older middle-age man right now and set them down, whole, in 2026--when people my age (in college) will be that age. Not a good idea: social mores have changed a lot! If you want good Sheffield, read something else."
3,What a dissapointment!,"After a slam-bang beginning, most of Sheffield's characters fall into idiot mode. Major world leaders make world-changing decisions based on fifteen minute interviews with 'experts' they've never met before. Insane bad guys set inexperienced teens to guard their captives while lots of more experienced people take the night off. Want to sleep in the White House? Just ask. Aides with no security experience will give you the run of the place.Perhaps worst are scientific explanations that drone on for pages, and are then repeated four or five chapters later.Nothing comes to any kind of conclusion, not even the execrable 'wait for the next episode in book two' sort of conclusion that S.F. has fallen prey to in the last twenty years.All that said, Sheffield's writing style is so deft and his characters so engaging that one can forgive him almost anything. His work is head and shoulders better that the dreck that many a best seller puts out."
5,Great Read,This is the first book I've read by this author. I had the benefit on knowing that little would actually be resolved at the end. (I bought the sequel halfway through reading this one.) I found this book to be a great read and got caught up in the fates of several of the characters. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel shortly.
5,Great Ratchet Set for tight places,Excellent for work in tight places where a normal ratchet handle won't fit.Multiple heads and sockets.Well worth it.
5,This book will transform your life.,"If you are ready to began your Spiritual Path, or already on your path, this book is invaluable. You will find the tools you need to work on a higher level, that will transform your life , and the lives of those around you. Putting an end to struggling on the physical level as you began to connect with your soul and create positive changes in you life with ease. If I was to recommend one book only, this would be the book."
2,Needed it for School,This book is very technical and somewhat hard to understand but I needed it for class. My teacher also did not like this book and is no longer going to use this one because it is very technical and hard to understand.
2,Not what I expected,"I thought my 4 year old would be able to sing along with most of the songs. She knows the songs, but they are performed in such a way that it's not easy for her to follow along."
4,GREAT 90's punk!,"Been a fan of punk rock for a long time (since the start), and these aussies ROCK. Only heard of them cuz I lived there for 8 years...and they deliver! If you like Suicidal Tendencies, Pennywise, etc - go for this - think you'd like it! The 'live' CD that comes with it is kind of a rehash of the studio stuff on the 1st CD, but it is good nonetheless..."
2,Toro Snowthrower,"I had one of these for about 10 years, and it worked fine (with annual maintenance, however). So I bought this identical unit a few years ago, and cannot get it to start! I've taken it in for service (to two different places); after a while, the guys will get it to start, but just state that it is tempermental. Too bad - the snow is not tempermental, and I have to go out with a shovel!This is my last Toro. I'll seek out another brand next time."
2,Hoping the second copy is better,"I loved working with this lens. It was great for panoramas, group photos and open vistas. The fisheye is only noticeable when the subjects are close (less than 10'). Unfortunately, when I finally got the images on my computer, I could see that every photo was noticeably defocused on the left side of the frame. I am returning it and hoping for a better copy."
3,a BIT DISAPPOINTED,"Got my lens a few days ago, and sorry to say I was a bit disappointed. First of all, the picture and description of the lens I ordered (for my Sony A-700) was inaccurate. There is NO HSM on this lens for the Sony, tho the picture would show otherwise. No auto and manual switch either. But the thing that really disappointed me was that I tried it at all apertures, and it just wasn't that sharp. I have other Sigma WA zooms that are much sharper and cost less than this one. As far as the build goes, I have no problem with that or the weight of the lens. It's a solid, well-built lens...unfortunately, I didn't purchase it for those reasons. It just doesn't perform the way I expected it to. Maybe I just got a dud. I don't know."
5,Job Well Done,This lens is very good. Wide Angle is putting it nicely. The Construction of the lens is superb and I am happy not to have wasted the money on the Canon 10-22mm for 200 more dollars.
2,"Good lens, but has quality issue","I purchased this lens for landscape shots. The range is good, but my copy was back-focusing by over 2 inches. I tested focus accuracy in different light, but without any success. I returned it, thanks to Amazon's great return policy."
5,Wide angle lens,I used reviews from others on this lens but had never bought a lens by this manufacturer before. Also i was curious if this lens would be compatible with my Nikon D40x. When i got the lens it was well packaged and protected. The lens was in good condition and worked well. I am very happy with the purchase.Andrew
2,Sigma Quality is not consistent,I received this glass and played with it for few days. Could never get a sharp image. May be I got a bad piece. Just returned it and did not take the risk of ordering another one. Will probably consider buy it from local store so that I can test it and then buy. You will have to do your won quality checks.
3,go canon,had both this and the canon. you get what you pay for. and you get better pictures with the canon wide glass on your camera. less distortion. and more vivid color. I returned the sigma.
4,"works great, but not good for low light","obviously, with it being f4 at best, its not great for low light, but at 10mm its perfect for real estate video. Would recommend saving for the tokina 11-16 f/2.8 instead, but still, its served me well."
4,Good Quality,"I have always been loyal to Canon brand lenses, as we have a dozen of them. I have not had good results from off brand lenses but this 10-20mm lens is a solid, quality piece of glass. It appears to be made well enough to withstand the use and abuse our equipment gets shooting outdoors on location. It is very sharp and the zoom ring slides very smoothly with good control. Time will tell if it holds up well after a year or two of use. I like the sunshade that is included with it, but also must note that it has a large front element that is very vulnerable to dirt or fingerprints. For the reasonable price of this very wide lens, I would say its a good value and a fun lens to do some abstract wide angle work without spending too much money."
3,Good lens but broke,"It's a good lens, not fast but good image and ver y little distortion, 10mm is amazing !But after 4 months of little use the autofocus stoped working, which is not a major problem because manual focusing is OK un such a wide angle ..."
1,"excellent for the content, but the software spoiled it.","The content is excellent but the interface of software is very bad. You can not copy and paste any word in the content, and the item browser is much unconvenient. These unfriendly design made this CD-ROM edition valueless. However, the new Interpreter's Bible on CD-ROM owns a much better design."
5,The real History of the west from someone who was there!,"I first uncovered this excellent book in 1964 while writing an original paper on the Mexican Spy Company for Department of the Army! I only had a colored drawing of a man wearing a large sombrero, green short jacket and thigh high boots, holding a long pike with a small red flag flying on the point of the pike! Then I meet Major General Ethan Allen Hitchcock! Hitchcock was there in the back ground while history was written and credited to others! This book is an edited diary that reads well and needs to be read well! History changes with each read! With out the work and loyal assistance of the Mexican Spy Company, many of the United States may not have arrived from history! Please read this book and look at the history others have taken credit for!"
4,Bouncing back from a sophmore slump,"So, first of all, the reviewer who said that ""perhaps"" sounds like old MxPx is a total moron! I hate MxPx, and perhaps sounds nothing like anything they've ever done. Rufio has always been a good band, but i felt like 1985 was a complete letdown. With ""home"", rufio bounce back to their militia roots, but somewhat. The songs still aren't quite as catchy, and the production value, or lack there of, hurts the overall sound, but all in all, things are looking up. Download ""out of control"" and ""bitter season"" to get a good feel for ""home"". Pop-punkers...enjoy!"
2,Rufio?!! WHY!??!,"AHHH, no! This CD is so boring and so NOT Rufio, I'm so disappointed that I cannot believe it. All the songs sound the same and have boring lyrics and no dynamics whatsoever. The Cool Riffs: GONE. The Great Hooks: Gone! The Sappy Lyrics: GONE!Perhaps I Suppose is still their best CDAnd the first half of 1985 is still amazingThis CD is NOT that amazing...the only song sticking out is A Simple Line...er wait, not really, it starts out really good with the opening guitar, then when the words come in, it stinks. This is so sad that this is what they came out with! AHH!"
5,A book you'll turn to again and again,"So you're at home, sitting in front of your computer or typewriter, and you're stuck on what to write next. No problem. Just grab your copy of ""Telling Lies For Fun and Profit"" to get your juices flowing. Or maybe you're confused on how to proceed to the next step in your writing career, and maybe you're not sure about genres, writing groups, Sometimes I wish that I had a veteran writer friend to have a talk with over coffee or a drink. With this book, I always feel like I do. Every writer should read this."
5,Great Book,"This is a great devotional, it goes through character studies and event studies, highly recommended."
5,My personal favorite horror novel,"I'm not a big fan of the horror genre for several reasons, one of which is the way that most horror novelists reject logic and reason in their books in favor of blind superstition. They also tend to have a dim view of humanity as a whole and all the efforts of the ""heroes"" usually comes to naught. Stephen King is especially guilty of this.I picked up Phantoms fearing that it would just be another example of this and was pleasantly surprised that the threat was logical and had its basis in science rather than superstition and that the main characters acted rationally in facing it. I was very impressed with the book and I still re-read it periodically."
4,Phantoms,Phantoms is another great suspenseful Koontz tale. It is scary and you are really rooting for the survivors. Highly recommended.
4,Definately a page turner,"It instantly brings you in and never gets boring. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't like what the killer ended up being(seemed kinda cheesy to me), but all-in-all it was a fantastic book and I couldn't put it down. I definately recommend it."
1,wannabe scary,"I was disappointed with this book. I had just finished ""In the Moonlight"" and loved it. To follow that with this was a let-down to me. It seemed like he was trying too hard to make it scary and it wasn't. Then I read his afterward and he agreed with me. That helped."
4,A classic Horror Story,"I just finished Phantoms last night and am so glad that I read it. This is a true horror story, plain and simple! The characters were great. Even the ones you did not like played great roles in the story. The ancient Evil was great to. Some feel the book draged on a bit to long, peronally I feel it could have been a bit longer. Dean does a great job giving the book a truly eerie feeling. This is my second favorite book by Koontz, second only to Whispers."
3,Gripping and imaginative but stylistically...,"I thought Phantoms was a good, quick read. Very imaginative and quite compelling. This is the 4th book I've read by Koontz and I enjoyed it very much. I think I liked ""The Bad Place"" better, but I was very satisfied with the read. Although the structure was very sound, the story well researched and quite imaginative, I don't think Dean Koontz is all that great a ""writer."" He doesn't have the knack for dialogue and character development Steven King has and I sometimes find myself cringing at some of his prose. Still, this book is a good pageturner and quite engrossing. 3 and a half stars."
5,flowers for algernon,this book was assigned in my english class to read many years ago....I loved it as much now as I did then....It is a fantastic book!
4,A reccomendable book,"I had first read the short version of this book and I liked it a lot so, when I saw it on a list of books that I had to read for a summer assingment to get into H.S.I didn't even glance at the other books on the list.I kind of regret doing that because I find it hard to review this book since in some parts Charley just starts to say these things that don't make any sense,but anyway this is a good book and I would reccomend it to anybody, EXEPT the people who have to do a report on it."
4,Flowers for Algernon,A wonderful heartbreaking and heartwarming story. The story is great and the storytelling is awesome. I highly recommend this book.
5,A fabulous and original story,"This is a poignant and wonderful novella about a man's metamorphisis from retarted worker to genius and his slow and painful transformation back to his original state. It is a powerful work because it somehow makes us question how we view people with intellectual disabilities, and ask is Charly, the main character, any ""better off"" with his new found intellect? It is sad, it is warm and funny, and it beautifully written and conceived. It is well worth a read."
5,A potent look at many aspects of humanity.,"The layers that are examined by this sometimes joyous, sometimes sorrowful novel have to be read to be believed. I can't believe how many emotions Daniel Keyes pulled out of me, he is a master. I just wish that he'd written more."
5,A very touching book!,"I just finished reading the book ""Flowers for Algernon"" and I really enjoyed it. I found it interesting to see life from a different person's perspective. It made me grateful for the things I have. I would recommend this book to anyone who's ready to see life through the eyes of another person."
5,It Has to be the best book I think I have ever read!,"When I was in school I could not put It down. I have a brother who is slow and I remember crying while I read because I felt Charlie's pain and frustration, and still to this day I think about how harsh people's attitudes are towards others and I'm glad ""flowers for Algernon"" was written and to tell you the truth I wish that all teachers would hand out this book just as Mrs.Arden did for me."
5,Flowers for Algernon,"This book is about a man named Chalrlie Gordon that hasn't mentallyand emotionally grown up. Charlie is 32 with an astonishing low I.Q. of 68. He is so determinded that he agrees to undergo an operation to increase his ability to learn but what Charlie learns is that the world is not quite what he thought it to be all his life. He learns that after all these years of thinking that his co-workers were his friends ""laffing,"" (as he calls it) with him, they were only making fum of him to make themselves seem surpirior. Charlie Gordan's tale was much of innocence and as the story develops you start feeling how cruel the world really is. It was very touching and I give Daniel Keyes 5 stars."
2,A book about a troubled man turned into a genius.,"Flowers for Algernon is about a caring, thoughtful, and hardworking man in search of something money can't buy, brains. Thirty-two year old Charlie Gordon is a mentally challenged student enlisted in night school to improve his intelligence. He thinks as if he can be smart, that he can have as many friends that he wants. He then learns that his quest for intelligence doesn't conclude the way he wanted it to.Flowers For Algernon is an exciting book about friendship, betrayal and how people can't change. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in neurological operations and mentally challenged persons. If so Flowers For Algernon is the book for you!"
4,STERLING HTS MICHIGAN,"FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON WASNT THE BEST BOOK IVE READ, BUT IT REALLY GETS YOU THINKING. CHARLY ACTUALLY CHANGED FOR THE WORSE. YES HE DID GET SMARTER BUT HE BECAME RUDE TO EVERYONE THAT CROSSED HIS SITE. SO THE THEME OF THE STORY TO ME WAS "" CHANGE ISNT ALWAYS FOR THE BETTER."" SO IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CHANGES IN PEOPLE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BOOK FOR YOU!READ IT!"
3,Just okay,"I love almost all of her books but her recent ones are just okay. Much prefer ready, willing and able, I will reread those over and over again, they are that good to me."
4,Pouting Never Fails...,This is a very humorous story.The first third of the story is my favorite part full of childish jealousy that I absolutely adore! very fun to read.
2,"Anchor Home Collection 4-Piece Ceramic Canister Set with Clamp Top Lid, White","I ordered this 4-piece ceramic canister based on picture on Amazon Webpage. This was a pre-order item without any Customer's Reviews. The quality of the canister's lids is very poor, one of the lids would not close and all four of the lids closing clips are not aligned correctly. I ordered this product with other items to get free shipping but since this item was a pre-order I was charged $11.00+ for shipping. I will never pre-order any items again without Customer's Reviews. This product should not be sold by Amazon."
4,"Good, but I think Dogzilla and Kat Kong are more bang for your buck","This is a cute story, and the play on words with Hally Tosis is funny. My son likes this story, but it doesn't engage him in the way that some of the other Dav Pilkey books do. The writing just isn't as funny as it is in Dogzilla and Kat Kong. However, the illustrations are very funny, and we like to talk about all of the different reactions to Hally's doggy breath. In fact, the illustrations entertain my son more than the story."
2,Too disjointed to get into,"I tried twice to read this book, and both times I just couldn't get into it. The reason for that is because it changed directions too many times in the first part of the book. I read 8% of the kindle edition and i felt like I was starting new books four times! The author would start a story line with one set of characters, I'd just start getting interested, then he's change directions entirely and start a different storyline with all new characters and i'd have to start trying to get interested all over again. I'm sure somewhere down the line the story lines would merge, but with so many characters following such different paths early on, I found I didn't care about any of them. I know there needs to be new characters introduced into every book, but in this one it just seemed so abrupt with the new story lines that it just lost my interest."
2,"Extremely Boring, Almost no Action, Mostly ""Filler""","This novel is 700 pages. The fisrt 600 pages are basically people having converstaions. Almost nothing happens until the end when Humanity is attacked by the aliens. Then we find out that the novel is continued in a second book. It seems that the first 600 pages are ""filler"" that one can sleep through.It seems to me that the author was required to produce a certain number of pages, regardless of whether or not he had enough of a plot.I understand that Hamilton is considered a talented writer, but is difficult for me to understand why. I would reccommend any of Robert Sawyer's books to those who want to read excellent sci-fi.This type of writing by authors like Hamilton, is due, in part, to the new trend among writers to leave the book unfinished so they can produce a sequel. This creates the need to artifically inflate the number of pages."
1,Too much filler and written too quickly with shallow plot,"I've decided to avoid PF Hamilton novels after a few bad experiences with his later works. Esp that last novel in the Nights Dawn Trilogy. He spent hundreds of pages setting up the excitement for it to be all neatly tidied up by using a ""God"" like machine that was in no way different than a big Genie granting your every wish. Nothing science fiction about it. This novel introduces some interesting science but does not use any of it in an interesting way. Devices are used and created without effort or exploration of their effects. The many many characters are too numerous for them all to become worth worring about. The aliens are too alien and thus hardly require any moral qualms about their inevitable demise. Peter in fact tries too hard to make them unlovable. His normal anti social tendencies of giving everyone in power the lowest morals is dreary and unsuprising. In summary this novel is a drag. Stay clear."
1,He's not in Heinlein's universe,"My god. This guy is a prolific writer in need of a good editor. Make that a very good editor. I failed to find an interesting character or story line. It seemed that much of the verbiage and description was just filler. Mid-way through, I relegated this tome to my emergency reading pile (in the bathroom), and eventually plowed through to the whimpering end. Toward the end, I just wanted it to be over, and found myself skipping pages and large sections of chapters to find anything meaningful. Then of course, the denoument, if you can call it that, was unsatisfying and inconclusive and intended to sell the next book in the series. No thanks."
2,Too many subplots.,"There are at least half-a-dozen subplots in this book, any of which could have (and should have) been a book unto itself. As it is, Pandora's Star is a disjointed narrative, flipping from one plot to another; not randomly, but annoyingly. At least two of the subplots are tedious enough that I ultimately just started skimming over those sections or skipping them entirely. Yeah, the author had a big story he wanted to tell, and it is an interesting story, but he didn't pull it off. Oh, and to end the book so bluntly just to make us have to buy his next one is just crass commercialism on his part.That's not to say that there aren't great elements in this massive story. But they are few and too far between to ultimately provide a satisfying experience. My advice, regrettably, is not to buy this book. And even if you can borrow it for free, don't bother reading it. There are far better ""space opera"" authors out there."
4,Pandora's Star and other universes.,"Well, I'm very satisfied with Pandora's Star... the problem is that I've just finished to read the Night's Dawn Trilogy a little bit before and, well, that was something that could rise the parameters, even within the same author's work..."
2,A waste of my time unfortunately.,"I do give this book 2 stars for potential with a wonderful future universe created by the author that could of been so great, but thats where it ends. I read 900 pages of 1000 and could not go as I felt I was wasting my time. I had made it that far with hope that at one point something would grab me and I would be swept up into the story and not counting pages.From the description of the book and the reviews written about it, I was expecting high pace galactic action, wonderful characters and page turning madness... yea no. Not much action and characters who I could care less about, that second note being the biggest let down. Many characters who had potential but its almost amazing how the writer has manage to create no connection with them and the reader, I could really care less about any of them.Some positives though, I really appreciate how this book felt like it could one day happen. The writer has a good handle on contemporary science and it shows."
1,I could not have been less interested,"Possibly the most uninteresting book I've ever tried to read. I couldn't make myself care about the characters, who were shallow and obvious. The writing was trite in the extreme. I got 50 pages in then had to put it down; I just couldn't waste any more of my time."
2,author needs an education,"Although I bought this book I'll be returning it soon. It's bascially so unreadable I actually got on the Inet to write this reveiw of the wretched thing.The year is 2380 and astronomers (who are discovering the end of whatever) are still guys wearing sweater looking out thru terrestial telescopes. I know we shouldn't have de-orbited the Hubble.In 400 years we still have dirty fission power plants.Aside from not knowing any science & writing a sci-fi book, Hamilton makes this book extremely boring. I just finished a biography & this book makes that one extremely exciting."
2,Grand verbosity,"This book is way to verbose. Aggressive editing is sorely needed. I'd guess that the book could be about one third of it's current size without missing a thing. This is the first book where i've skipped pages several times. If it was a library book, i would return it after some 200 pages.I liked The Reality Dysfunction -- the thickness was justified by interesting subplots. The fact that humanity had acually evolved was a nice change from most sci-fi too.This book does not stand out in any such way. It's not the worst book i've read, and i will probably read the sequel too (but not if the story doesn't end there!), but i would not have read it if i knew about the fat.Short story: buy some other book"
3,Nice Construction poor performance,These are very good looking lights but they are solar. If you have any trees on your property performance is spotty. I returned these lights and will install a wired system. Amazon handled the return extremely well.
4,great product,"Love the set I received. I had two lights that didn't work. I emailed and they sent a new set out and let me send them back the first set at no cost to me. The lights are great, but some days not all of them are getting a full charge from the sun so they don't last all night. Otherwise, a wonderful product."
5,Amazing Light. Works great. Works great even with little sunlight,I placed it in a place where sunlight remains for a very short time. Glow at full for a long time even in rainy and cloudy day. Very strudy design. The Glow is excellent. Very easy to assemble. GREAT LANDSCAPING PRODUCT. WORKS EXCELLENT. WHITE LEDS ARE GREAT. INCLUDED 2 BATTRIES. 100% SATISFIED.
2,poor battery life,"the quality of the lights are excellent, glass and stainless steel, but the battery life is very poor.if the light works past 4 hours, you would be luckytwo lights did not work at allavoid these lights"
3,Boring,Hard to see and listenVery academicThis style does not contribute to the cause of ambientalist and to increase the awareness on global warming and climate change
1,garbage,if you want other people's worldview and presuppositions shouted at you every thirty seconds then this is the movie for you
3,Best Nap of My Life!! (but my friend liked it),"Don't see this movie unless the room is cold and you've got a lot of coffee at hand... and hard seats would come in handy. I didn't see much of it, just scientists trying to convince me to find real estate on another planet, but it just didn't grab me and I ended up sleeping through most of it.My friend said it was sort of interesting (though his mind wandered a bit) and informative and not one of the typical ""The world is going to blow up and it is the Republican's fault"" dumbfests you usually expect to see of this genre. Though he said he got some thing out of it, he did admit it was rather slow and he was envious of my sleep."
4,Works very well for my needs,"I use this keyboard with my Treo and find it very helpful when I don't have my laptop with me. I do genealogy research and can enter information in the documents to go quickly. The setup on the keyboard takes a little getting used to but it's light weight, flips out quickly and works beautifully with the Treo."
2,not too impressed,"this disapointed me, it is awkward to set up and never was able to get wifi and yes i followed directions, decided to do without it, when folding it back up pay attention or you will break it,"
2,Klutzy,"The one thing I can say for this little contraption is that it works--sometimes. But it doesn't secure the handheld into position very well. The little support bar that the handheld is supposed to rest on continually retracts, causing the handheld to fall out of place. I have to keep the handheld in place with a strong rubber band--and even then it can shift around. Also, the arm that houses the infrared (IR) sensor keeps going out of alignment with the IR sensor/transmitter on the handheld.One nit: I wish Palm would've called it an IR Keyboard. Technically, the product is indeed wireless. But folks today generally associate the word ""wireless"" with Bluetooth or WiFi, which implies that you don't have to strap-in your handheld and make sure the IR sensors are aligned. Sure, IR has an advantage over ""wired"" keyboards in that you can use it (kinda) with a wide variety of handhelds. But if you only have a single handheld, a ""wired"" keyboard would probably be much easier to use."
2,Didn't work,"Keyboard didn't work. CD-useless; driver out of date, no Getting Started guide. Tried everything-downloaded IR port testing utility. (Palm IR port was fine.) I spent 2 hrs. fussing with it; seller told me to repeat everything I'd tried, & finally refunded $ (I'd already bought a new, unopened keyboard, same model-worked right out of the pkg.) Seller said they'd tested the keyboard."
4,Love the Keyboard,"The keyboard has done everything it was said to do. It is easy to set up, the tx finds it quickly and the keys are well placed. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I am not sure how it will stand up long term."
3,Palm wireless keyboard,"Overall, pretty good. I must have had a newer CD since it installed fine. The main problems are that:1. You still need to use the stylus a lot, and there isn't a place to put it. A little holder would be great. (Hint, hint!)2. The ""Home"" and ""End"" keys don't work. Period. Miss them a lot!3. I use my right thumb, by habit, to type the spacebar, and that's just where the hinge thing is -- so I'm trying to train myself to type space with my left thumb, which is really hard still.Overall, I'm delighted to have it. (I think one of the reviewers is reviewing a different product, since there isn't a connector on this keyboard -- it's wireless.)"
4,ATTENTION AUDIOHEADS: UNEXPECTED PLEASURES,"If you reckon-- like I do-- that '5.7.0.5.' is one of the great singles of the late Seventies, then this album is for you. Each song treads a fine line between serious rock and candy store pastiche. One song sounds like Springsteen doing E.L.O.-- the next makes you dream of an alternate dimension where The Doobie Brothers play 10CC. This album should've done better at the time; there are many tracks here that could've got airplay. And-- ATTENTION AUDIOHEADS! This is where producer ""Mutt"" Lange cut his teeth before going on to helm some of the era's biggest records."
1,"This version dosent include the ""orginal"" version","I bought this version, at the misunderstanding that it included the real version of it. And I know about 3 other friends who have also. I like the remix, not as much as I like her with Bone on Breakdown but the classic dub crap has got to go. I mean people are buying this thinking they have the original. Nice misleading advertising Columbia! Im mad."
2,"Use to work, doesn't now!","I use to buy this product online somewhere and it worked the first two times I bought it and then the next time I bought it, it did NOT work at all. My dog was ate up with fleas and we did everything. Then my cousin goes in half with me and buys Advantix and instead of putting it right behind his neck, he put it there and all the was down his back but to where the dog couldn't reach to lick it and his poor thighs were infested with fleas and they all went away and they haven't been back since and I don't want them back but that stuff is so expensive I'm going to have to borrow money to buy some with because you have to have it. Advantix killed the fleas, got rid of them and kept them from coming back and it also kept the ticks off of him. He did not bring in a tick once this year, when they were out and I never had to get any off of him because that Advantix protected him."
2,Be careful this is not the Sigma DC II lens,"I've just received my lens and I was a bit dissapointed that it's not a DC II as you could see in the product description. I didn't expect this considering that the product is shipped and sold by Amazon.This is the 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 DC which doesn't include OS (Optical Stabilizer Function - utilizes a built-in mechanism that compensates for camera shake) and HSM (Hyper-Sonic Motor- uses a motor driven by ultrasonic waves to provide a quiet, highspeed AF)Even when there's a price diference you might consider buying the Sigma 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM for about $200 more.You can find further detail inhttp://www.sigmaphoto.com/shop/multipurpose-zoom-lenses"
1,Garbage - wait for Pentax,"This is the worst camera lens I've ever had the misfortune to use.I wanted something I could travel with to replace my 18-55mm kit lens (I have a K100D) plus the 50-200mm telephoto zoom. These are great lenses but I was trying to hold down the bulk and weight, so I gave Sigma a try.Big mistake. This thing is TERRIBLE. Horrible chromatic distortion -- I frequently got BOTH purple and green fringing effects on opposite sides. Depending on the zoom and the angle I was shooting at, I got laughably distorted barrel and pincushioning -- sometimes in THE SAME SHOT. Literally, the extreme barrel distortion would flare back out at the corners. And it won't focus properly -- the center will be fairly crisp but the edges will be completely gone -- not the far edges either, but a mere third of the way across the frame. It vignettes really badly.This is a CRAPPY, CRAPPY lens. I've seen better on dollar trashcams in the thrift store."
5,Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC lens for Canon Digital SLR,"Photography is a new hobby for me. Because I have very little experience with the camera, I have had to rely on what others tell me and what I read. I chose this lens because I felt the wide range would suite my needs best as a beginner. I am so happy that I did. It is very easy to use and takes great pictures. I used it on the family beach vacation for my first big practice session and the results are beautiful. When I am ready for another lens I am sure to by another Sigma. Very Pleased."
3,Practical...but image quality is disappointing.,This lens is very practical given its range. It's a perfect match to the entry level D40/60 with its built in focusing motor. If you are looking to upgrade from your 18-55 kit lens or want to replace your 18-55 and 55-200 with one lens then this is a great option.I've used this lens since December 08. I am dissapointed in the image quality. This is a great option for someone taking snapshots with their dslr that doesn't want to bother changing lenses. Forget about using this in low light. It's also very very soft at 200mm. OS doesn't seem to make much difference...If you use your dslr like a point-and-shoot then this is the lens for you (you'll save a fortune over the Nikkor version). If you take your photography seriously and want to grow... forget this lens.
5,Great Read,"If you are a true wolverine fan then this is for you, it has a great story and awsome artwork. Amust for any true fan."
4,Can't Eat Just One!,"Ok after eating Blair's Death Rain Hot Wing chips this is like eating a cracker. That aside, these are a pretty good chip, especially if you don't like `em hot and spicy. These are tangy, crunchy, and hard to stop eating."
4,Good flavor,"These chips have great flavor as is but I am more into the buffalo wings flavor more than the bleu cheese flavor, but it's a combo that seems to work well, I probably would like it even more if it just had the heat and flavor of just the buffalo wing sauce. And you cannot beat the crunch on these."
4,Yummy chips!,"My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!"
5,I love Chelsea,"I love Chelsea Handler' s books, I've read her books, seen her shows and I never tire of her vulgar wit and sarcasm"
1,Glamorous Addict,"I like to read memoirs and the title looked interesting, only to see how misleading it is.I could not identify with the narrator. As one whom went to rehab twice, hit a very hard bottom, I tried to relate to her addictions and her bottom. She glamorized her addiction and her bottom. Anyone who is a member of AA will see right through her and know that glamorizing her addictions shows she has a long way to go find serenity, humility, and acceptance of her addictions. It becomes clear she doesn't actually like anyone unless she's high, drunk and horny. She's not an endearing drunk or a decent storyteller. She's mean-spirited, prejudiced self-centered and worst of all, not funny.I saw her yesterday on the Bill Maher show and she hasn't changed from her addiction racked personality. I didn't find humility, but rather a self-centered, belligerent, unhumorous sad person."
1,BORING!!,"I read this book in a couple of hours. Most of it appears to me to be the result of an active imagination, not true hook ups. The author tries too hard to be amusing, and instead comes across as trite and shallow. I don't know, maybe she is trite and shallow. Probably is."
5,My Kind o' Gal!!,"When I finished the first chapter of this book, I ran right out to Barnes & Noble and bought the remaining 6 copies for my girlfriends who would appreciate this absolutely hilarious, honest and totally entertaining memoir. What a gal! So my best friend and I sat side by side at the beach laughing like a couple of hyenas. Our kids were worried about us. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it had to end at all. I could have gone on another 700 pages! Chelsea is delightful and so damn funny...I emailed her when I was done and she answered! I hope we are fortunate enough to get a lot more of her blunt, honest humor in the near future. She ROCKS!"
1,"Terrible writing, trashy content, NOT funny","Chelsea Handler is NOT a good writer. These stories are crude, without being entertaining or funny. There's no point to this collection. My sympathies to her family."
1,Chelsea takes me back to 8th Grade,"I haven't been teased this ridiculously since, let me think--8th grade?Perhaps my problem with this popular book is a sure sign of generation gap. But it hurts me to realize the Chelsea Handler generation is so tame. As a boomer, I lived the Boomer Bacchanal of the 1970s on the front lines of the sexual revolution. It was a decade when the largest clump of twenty-somethings lost their innocence after failed first marriages and had nothing to lose thanks to birth control and antibiotics. I realize the environment changed with AIDs and Ted Bundy in the 1980s. But I had hoped something was still happening out there.After reading about Chelsea's so-called horizontal life and seeing it climb on the charts, however, I guess nobody else is getting busy, either. Just like me in the 8th grade and Chelsea today."
3,Ho-Ho-Ho!,"I felt deliciously naughty reading about Chelsea's sex life in My Horizontal Life her coming of age story (pun intended). This book revealed her sexual misadventures in a funny, irreverent way. As Chelsea sows her wild oats across America, I couldn't help but wonder how much of her stories are tall tales, but in the end it doesn't really matter because, true or not, sex with a midget is funny. Chelsea talks about her sexual exploits with an openness that I suspect most American society is still uncomfortable hearing from a woman. But if you are looking for a racy, funny book of light essays, you've found it. It's trashy, but fun..."
3,OK,"I bought this because it was on special, not my typical read. The narration sort of rambles in a conversational style and things move quickly from chapter to chapter, beings a new adventure takes place. I wonder how much is true. I pray not all of it. ;) Fun."
2,Wouldn't recomend.,"Disclaimer: I'm a dude.This book was somewhat funny, uh thats about all there is to say about it."
2,she's a comedian?,"I ordered this book because I read the reviews, and it was described as the female version of Tucker Max's ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell"". I thought that book was obnoxious and absolutely hysterical. I was hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, I didn't think she was nearly as funny as he is. It was a quick read and kept my attention most of the time, but the stories were sub-par at best.I didn't laugh out loud. I thought some stories sounded too far fetched and made up- whether they are actually true or not, I'm left wondering."
3,A fun & quick read,"This wasn't my favourite Chelsea read, but I read it quickly and had some good laughs.It was funny and cute."
4,Dirty girl,If you love Chelsea Hanler this is a must read. One great one night stand after the next.
4,Funny!,"I'm only 14 and I caught the humor in this book in which writes about her personal "" one-night stand"" experiences that were horribly distorted."
4,Fun book!,Chelsea Handler shares some very funny memories in this book. There were moments when I burst out laughing. Easy leisurely reading.
4,Witty and fun - worth a read,"This book started off hysterical...I couldn't put the book down...I'm still not sure if there isn't just a little fiction in there, some of the things that Chelsea did are truly unimaginable...the book is definitely entertaining but lacks a strong ending...I felt the last few chapters dragged on and all the humor was lost...but overall I still really enjoyed the book."
2,I just don't get it,"I wanted to like this book. I wanted to read a story about a strong, confident woman who is not afraid to be open about her healthy and active sex life. I was looking for something along the lines of Sex and the City.This story is not about healthy one night encounters with quirky men. Instead it is about dangerous, very drunken one night stands. Even the ""friends"" she writes about are pretty nasty people. I'm sure the people in the book were written in a poor light in order to make the book funnier but, instead, it makes you thankful that this isn't your life."
2,A poor attempt at humor,"I bought this book hoping to be entertained. It has been three weeks since I read it and am having problems recalling anything from this book except for the fact I think I cracked a smile probably three times. Overall completely unfunny, and totally forgettable. A single pane of Dilbert is funnier and has more to say than this entire book."
5,Totally Hilarious,"I bought this on the suggestion of a friend and could not put it down. It's hilarious and so TRUE. For anyone who has ever had a few too many drinks and had a one-nighter, had to endure ""the walk of shame"" or listened to their friends stories of random hook-ups - you will not only relate but laugh until it hurts."
1,My Horozontal Life,"I FOUND THE BOOK VERY SHOCKING. SINCE WE HAVE SUCH A DRUG AND TOO MUCH SEX (THE WRONG KIND) IN OUR SOCIETY, I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK PERSONALLY. I CAN'T IMAGINE A WHOLESOME YOUNG LADY THROWING HER LIFE AWAY IN THIS FASHION."
3,FUNNY!,Pretty darn funny. Super easy read when you dont wanna think and just laugh this is your book.
4,great book for general reading,"I was SO excited to receive this book because I love watching Chelsea's TV show. I would recommend this book ONLY for people who have a sense or humor and someone who just wants to read for fun. This book is full of stories and they range from chapter to chapter. (Some are more extreme than others). Some of the stories I can't help but question whether they're true or AT LEAST have some sort of twist on them. I think I must have read this book in 4 days and was a VERY easy read- almost boring at the end. Eventually, I'll probably end up buying her other book ""Are You There Vodka, It's Me Chelsea?"" but I'm in no rush. Overall, OK for a time-passing book."
3,JUST OKAY,"I watch Chelsea Lately every single night and loved her other books. I knew this book had been written before her show ever aired so understood it was not really celebrity-written. I purchased it b/c it was on sale through Kindle. It was an okay read - I laughed a few times and it was pretty funny but it is mostly about her sexual encounters gone wrong and if you do not like crude humor or talk about sex, you will be highly offended!"
3,Just okay,This book was entertaining but not all the hilariously funny. It is refreshing to see a woman who is comfortable talking about her sex life with complete strangers. It is a bit of fluff to fill the time.
3,Pretty funny. Great sense of humor.,This book is an easy read. Actually laughed out loud a few times while also being grossed out. Would recommend it for some good laughs.
3,It's like a season of Springer in book form,"Somehow, I thought this would be funnier. While she does sneak in some awesome one liners, overall, I was kinda disappointed as my brother had raved to me how funny this book was. Don't get me wrong, Chelsea is a funny, sarcastic force of nature but it seemed to lose something in translation to book form. I can see this more as a movie or stand up show rather than a book. Shrug. Still worth the time it took to read so ""be good to yourself"" and read about someone else's sex life."
2,The New Poster Girl For Shallow,"Maybe I expected too much. I didn't expect Sedaris or Christopher Moore funny, but at least a little funny. Normally, I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to humor. This wasn't a funny book. It turned out to be a book about how to seek perfection in shallow. Her sexploits weren't even book worthy. And the drinking seemed pointless, except to mask her self-loathing. Can't blame her for being self-loathing. I loved the stories about her dad, thus two stars instead of one."
5,unbelievably funny!!!,You have to read this immediately!!! Each story is funnier than the next and will have you laughing until you cry!If you like David Sedaris you will love this. Don't miss it...
3,Please enter a title for your review,After becoming a fan of Chelsea Handler's unique brand of tv comedy I checked out this book assuming there must be more to her only to find out there's actually less. Even the comedy in this book is of the more generic gender-divide sitcom variety. It is however anthropologically eye-opening to realize that someone this shallow actually exists.
2,Interesting but simple,"I wasn't really expecting much, just hoping to learn a little about women who like to sleep around. The first few chapters were interesting, but after a while it was the same thing over again and it got really boring. I wouldn't say it's an intellectual read at all, and might border on romance novel with some bed comic relief. My girlfriend also read it and couldn't put it down, so maybe it's for girls. I wouldn't advise buying it, just get it at the library if you really want to, but I wouldn't say it's a must read."
1,not funny,This book really isn't as funny as everyone says it is. She spends most of the book putting people and herself down. It's really quite sad.
1,thank you for the warning !!!!!,i was a fan of chelsea handler for years . i had a chance to see her show it turned out to be an awful experience . i feel she has lost touch with the people who made her famous . since that show in october of 2010 i havent watch . i was so close to giving her a second chance by purchasing this book . i downloaded a sample . thanks for the reveiw it snapped me back into my right frame of mind i would download the entire book for free . she sucks
3,Eh. Funny at times...,"I picked this up for my Kindle since it was on sale at a great price. And really, for $1.99 I more than got my money's worth. But, still, it was a disappointing read.This is basically the story of an alcoholic floozy. That does make for a laugh once in a while. But, it wasn't laugh out loud funny. More distracting was the fact that it really sounds like the driver is routinely drunk driving - which makes it a little harder to laugh."
4,Chelsea's a train wreck you can't look away from,"I was alternately repulsed, entertained, shocked, offended,but ultimately amused. Don't read if you embarrass easily. Do read if you need a laugh and want to feel better about your own life choices."
5,Love her humor!,"I read this in about four hours; it was amazing. I laughed non-stop and even cried from laughing so hard. If you are not familiar with Handler, she's a bit raunchy and very blunt. If you get offended easily, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, go ahead and have a few good laughs!"
3,my horizontal life,"its got some funny stories! some of the stuff i know she says for a laugh but , i still cant bielieve she says some of that!! haha"
3,"Not the greatest thing in the world, but if you can get it for free...","I hate her show, but liked her column in Cosmo so I decided to give this book a try. It's funny. She's a decent writer, probably embellished the stories a bit but who cares? We all have crazy stories but weren't smart enough to make a book out of them. Props to her for turning her promiscuity into a best-seller. Shoniqua was the best. Hope she's real."
4,Never read her writting before,I had seen her show a few times and thought it was okay. I bought the book because I needed something else for super free shipping.I was very supprised by how much I enjoyed this book and how much I laughed.
4,Great Book,"I bought this book after catching the Chelsea Handler Show on E! At first I was a bit disappointed because I thought her stand up was hysterical. And then it occurred to me that I was actually laughing out loud while reading this book. Nor could I put the book down. It's a bit different than her stand up, but every bit as entertaining."
1,Poorly Written,"Skip this book. First of all, it's poorly written. Her stories take off on too many tangents. Secondly, after a while, I grew annoyed that each story was just about the same thing, over and over again. No growth, just one sloppy, drunk night after another with questionable men."
3,Pretty light stuff for Chelsea,"Mildly entertaining,but with little of the sharp edge and wit one would expect. It would make sense if it was being penned by a 20 year old, but one would expect more insight, effort and juicy detail from Chelsea. For a quick read by the pool it's ok - mainly because it won't put you to sleep. There is a certain anticipation that with each chapter and chronological development Chelsey will really start to dish...but it never happens."
4,My horizontal life,Loved it =)It was hilarious! I felt embarrassed for her half the time. Definitely a book I'd recommend to a friend.
4,Still funny,Another funny book. I can't believe all those stories are real.. but if they are.. wow. It was fun to read.
5,Not as skanky as you'd imagine... but still Totally Relatable!!!,"After seeing it on Amazon and reading the first few pages I ran to the bookstore on my lunch break and bought it... & finished it later that day... It was AMAZING!!!!It's a series of chapters in her life that are hysterical and very much like your own life (if you're a party animal like circle of friends).... Some of us aren't as extreme in certain aspects of our lives as she is, but nevertheless, it is great!!! I will definitely read this book again in the future after I read a few others.. I also want to read her Vodka book... I will buy it immediately when it comes out in paperback..But.. The book isn't as slutty as the title makes it seem. It didn't get into any details of anything ""nasty"".. But I've bought copies of this book and given them to my friends who I knew would appreciate a book like this.. and they've all LOVED it!! So read it!"
3,Not all that funny,"I received a recommendation to buy this from a person on my pool team (billiards not swimming). I was not impressed. It was not all that funny and I ended up feeling sorry for this author vs. being amused. I guess I also thought the book would be more racey and have more ""bedroom"" humor vs. it sounding like a college students rantings about their bedroom conquests (or lack there of). It was a quick read though."
5,Hilarious!!!,"Best book that ive ever read!! I laughed out loud the entire book, cant wait for more!!"
2,Why I dont like it..,"Well I honestly thought this book would be as much fun to read as watching chelsea's show. Wrong. it started out funny, but soon became shallow and cheap... with no story line whatsoever. the one-too-many mentions of her genitalia and her drug habits really disgusted me.. and Im not one to take scandal easily. Just thought this book would be more..elaborate. 30% into the book, Handler mentions a male and you immediately know.. ok.. shes gonna sleep with him and we're gonna know how she did it. in EVERY sense of the word. not a read i would recommend at ALL..."
2,Chelsea No No,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't like this book at all. It was a disappointment. The book consists of random exaggerated stories that don't really mesh together. On top of that I felt like she was pretty crude in most of her stories. Crude as in just a tad trashy.Question to pose: She was on drugs most of the time in this book... how did she remember all of her encounters so vividly?"
4,Great Read,"I have never watched Chelsea's show nor have I watched any of her stand up acts. The title of the book is what caught my eye at the bookstore. I needed a good, funny book and this was it! Sure, a few of the stories seemed a bit ..hmm..can't think of a good word for it; not ""made up"" but just a little out there. But I don't care. I wasn't looking for her truthful biography or anything. ;) She is a great writer and I'm going out to buy her 2nd book today. This book will definitely be passed around among my friends and family. :) Now I may have to check out her show, as well!"
4,Hilarious and disrespectful--at the same time!,"This is such a funny book. However, be warned that Chelsea does include some racism and stereotyping. All that aside, it's still hilarious and included a lot of nice stories of her life when she wasn't a household name. It really reveals her true colors and where she comes from. I think it was a worthwhile read despite all the discrimination."
3,This...,"Was as silly and ridiculous as her other books. I liked it no more and no less. If you like Chelsea Handler's show or her sense of absurd, you might like this book...no guarantees!"
2,Boring to say the least,Being a fan of Chelsea 's I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy this book and her wacky ventures but to be honest it got boring in the 3rd story. It was also an easy read and after a while was extremely predictable. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone and now I am a little put off by reading her other books especially if they are written like this. There should be someone (editor) to give this book a once over because there are some grammatical errors too.
2,"Good idea, just didn't work for a wiggly baby.","Our sons are always so wiggly, this would fall right off. I agree just using a washcloth is much easier and less likely to fall off."
2,"Corny, Corny, Corny","I so wanted to like this book, and it really had a great beginning. But the characters are so stereotyped, so unreal, that I groaned all the way through. The plot is absolutely predictable - you know exactly where its going - there are no surprises. There are very good people and very bad people here, no nuances, all is black and white.I agree that it is a sweet fairy tale, but ye gads, - how bout a little reality!!"
1,Psychic [...] Night?,"I thought this would be a good read, but I couldn't get passed the pyschic [...] night with everyone talking to and fondling there [...].. Sorry but it wasn't for me, and I would not recommend this book to a friend."
3,Fun Adventure,"This book is campy and funny and irreverent. It is not particularly well-written, although the opening image of throwing a wedding dress into a tree is great. It's very much oriented to women and it's a good read--a good escape book."
4,A very satisfying read,"I liked this book a lot. It was long, but it only dragged a few times, and usually not for very long. It was a good book to sink into, and it had a lot of characters I'd love to befriend! Why 4 stars instead of 5? Julia herself was a little bit annoying. Also, the evil boyfriend was a bit *too* evil to be believable. In general, the way the book ends was also too good to be true, but I don't really mind that. I'm a sucker for a happy ending! This is a great book to curl up with- grab a cup of tea and a blanket and sink in!"
2,This Genre Has Been Done to DEATH,"This book was a sad, unoriginal mish mash of ""Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood,"" ""When Katie Wakes,"" ""Persian Pickle Club,"" blah blah blah.Absolutely nothing original about this book. If you've read more than one book about a group of women supporting each other, then you've pretty much read this book."
5,Deliciously Complex,"wow, I loved this book! Best thing I've read in ages.The characters are well developed - highly quirky, funny and will without a doubt work their way into your heart. Although this is a story about friendship and courageous women, it is also a tale about facing your fears, having the courage to take risks and finding yourself. What a journey - I simply howled about the Psychic Nights, cheered at the victories and felt the fear they faced. I can not wait for Ms. Lamb's next book and have to admit that it was hard to see this book end.There were many moments where I laughed and cried during this treasure."
5,10 STARS,"This product was WAY better than I expected. It has a very sturdy construction that can handle everyday use and some banging up. I used a Merriam-Webster electronic dictionary for years, but the Oxford Dictionary offers much more comprehensive definitions AND it lists the phonetic spelling. The keys are large and you don't run the risk of the typing errors that tend to accrue on smaller electronic dictionaries. This one is about the size of a small note card in its closed position. The encyclopedia, though concise, offers most of the basic information needed when reading books, or even watching educational television that references people, places, and movements. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for ANY student, reader, and/or human being."
4,The best deal on Amazon!,"I bought this toy for my 6 yr old cousin and she is having a blast. I have to say that before I actually ordered mine. I went to Toys R Us and priced it...$69.99. Hello! $19.99 on Amazon, who can beat that! If it broke and I bought another it would still beat TRU's price, but luckily we haven't experienced any problems yet. I transferred music directly Windows media player before even using the setup CD that it came with. It is sooo easy. GREAT DEAL!!!!"
2,Not worth the price,"When I got the package from Amazon.com, I spent a few confused minutes thinking, ""Where's the book?"" Turns out this book is only 23 pages long, and is the quality of a Xerox copy. Luckily, I had a $10 gift certificate, so I only paid shipping for the book. It's worth that, but not worth it's cover price. Has some decent sample questions, but was mostly a disappointment."
2,heat problems,Don't be fooled by the fact that the amp it has a built in fan. This amp has serious heat problems. The amp get very warm at 4 olhms and gets hot enough to burn you when it is bridged. I would suggest saving your money and buying a better amp.
4,Foot and Calf Massager,"I have had this product for about 2 years. The unit works quite well, and is great for post workout muscle stimulation. In addition the unit doubles as a foot rest. so you really have a device with 3 functinons. Foot, calf massager and a functional foot rest. Great bargain !"
4,Chizhik--unknown genius,"Leonid Chizhik is one of those unknown geniuses that a few are lucky to discover now and again on these pages. These live solo jazz piano recordings were made in 1979-80 and 1986 in Russia. He's a master improviser and a good technician. He uses huge, blocky chords at times -- and since the recording is good you can hear the inner voices well. There's a bit of audience noise, but nothing different from most live recordings. I only give it a ""4"" rather than a ""5"" because of one track that's a real clunker (#3), sort of oompah band meets jazz. I re-recorded my disc to remove the track."
2,Too cheap,"This was a ""Santa"" present for our four-year old. When I opened the package, one of the vehicles was broken so I tossed it (it was Christmas Eve, and Santa doesn't give broken toys). The boy loved it and played with it more than any other toy on Christmas Day. But by New Years, another of the vehicles had pieces falling off. Now, less than 2 months later, the hook won't raise or lower and the little boy is very disappointed.This toy has great potential and is realistically detailed...too bad it's a cheaply made piece of junk."
2,Looks good but ...,We ordered the crane for a Christmas present and it arrived very quickly however on Christmas morning it only worked for about 3 hours and then some of the control buttons quit working and it was very disappointing to say the least. My son can still use it but he has to manually pull out the extension on the crane and lower the bucket. It will be out this summer in our annual yard sale!
2,Disappointed,I really enjoyed the first book in the series but had a tough time with the 2nd. I just didn't feel the characters hit home at all. I ended up speeding thru the last half of the book so I would have the content but really didn't enjoy reading it. I hope the next ones better.
3,bloodlines is interesting,"boba fett was previously the kind of guy that shut himself off from his distracting emotions, but apparently, from the vuuzhan vong war and meeting his granddaughter, he has become a different man. that is good to see because we all make changes. the changes with Jacen are normal enough, but i guess we gotta wait for another book to find out about how he is going to react to this prophecy given to him by his new teacher.if he reacts how she seems to want him to...that'll be really freaky, and i will have lost a lot of respect for Jacen, but overall i don't think it will hurt the overall storyline. I hope we get to see some of Tahiri in this series later on."
4,"""20 Years of Romance with additional cuts""","This cd is really ""20 Years of Romance"" with several interesting additions. For example, Tennille belts out: ""Save the Best for Last"", ""Unforgettable"", and does a funky remake of ""Lonely Nights"". Better than ""20 Years of Romance"" because Tennille ""hits"" some of the notes on some of the ""new"" songs."
2,Good for the money but not for lifting!,These gloves fit well and aren't too bad but don't work well for lifting. I had to buy a different pair. They are cheap and work to protect the hands.
2,Cheaper... but try something else,"You will receive the quality of what you're paying. The first time I used it, this glove started to get untie and unravel in both thumbs. I know it's the cheapest option (that's why I bought it) but try something ele."
2,very cheap material,i guess you get what you pay for. the price was very low as the quality of the gloves. they will do the work but they feel like they are going to rip off any time. next time i will invest more money into better gloves since working out is something i really enjoy doing.
4,Nice gloves,I needed a size XXL and a decent price.The gloves are very nice and much better than similar gloves forund at a large retail store. The hook and loop closers on them meake them easy to get on and off. They are a nice durable glove and perform weell so far.
2,Well it's different,"When I initially bought them, I gave them 5 stars and wrote a glowing review. I happened to visit city sports recently and checked out the same gloves. But I realized that they were different from the ones I received. The ones in this pic and at city-sports seem to have better leather and more cushion. But the ones I received were very basic. The seams are different too. I am wondering if I got something counterfeit now. I am working out with my gloves and they are ok but if you are looking to get the exact same gloves, you might be a little surprised when they arrive."
3,Comfy and cute,"I liked how they look.I liked how they fit.I really like that they are mesh. The small fit perfect and my hands didn't get sweaty while lifting like they do with other gloves.That being said, I have had them for 3 weeks now, and they are starting to get very worn in. I am already looking for a new pair of gloves. I do serious lifting in the weight room, and they are not very durable.If you are lifting smaller weights, or a beginner, I imagine these might last longer. If you are looking for real heavy-duty lifting gloves, then these are not for you."
4,Good product at a fair price,The globes are sturdy and well made. This is my second pair. The only drawback is that the end of the stubs tend to fold backward over time.
1,obviously a cheap copy,"This was obviously a cheap copy, it's not even leather, I am disappointed Amazon doesn't try to maintain a standard. This makes me wary of ordering from them again.0 stars is my rating!"
1,Fell Apart!,"I was very pleased with how these gloves fit and how they felt, but after only using them to lift 3-4 times, the stitching started coming apart, and I ended up having to sew them just to finish my workout. Now I have to buy another pair to replace these. Total waste of my money and time. I definitely wouldn't recommend these and would not buy again."
5,I love Looney Tunes,Anyone 50 or older knows our old cartoons still rule. Bought this as a gift for my baby brother since it included a wonderful piece on the great Mel Blanc.
4,More Looney Gold,"Keep 'em coming. Nothing in the history of animation can match Warner Bros. Interesting commentaries and features and all those classic cartoons. This set contains some lesser ""stars,"" and some less familiar shorts."
2,Disappointing,"I have purchased each volume of the Golden Collection so of course when this one came out I hurriedly ordered it as well.My goal in buying this collection was to recapture those great cartoons that I watched as a child. Many have since been discontinued or heavily edited on TV, so this was a way of enjoying these classic cartoons from the days before we became so politically correct.I am not one to expect that every cartoon will be a favorite, but I'll have to say this volume is rather full of filler. All of the classic cartoons on disk 3 are the type you'd find in the discount stores for a dollar a disk and are certainly not what I expected for my money. Those who want the very early cartoon classics with unknown characters might love this collection, but I expected to see Golden cartoons, not ancient ones!WB could have done much better than this, but I guess they expected die-hard fans like me to buy it anyway. They got their wish, but shame on them for not doing better than this."
4,"GOOD, BUT ONLY FOR THE AVID COLLECTOR","This is a good collection, but it is only for the avid Looney Tunes and vintage cartoon collector, like me. Some of these shorts may not be interesting to some people, including children. Most of these cartoons are World War 2 propaganda, which were shown at movie theaters at the time, encouraging people to buy victory bonds for defense. There is also some violence.I recommend the Spotlight Collection Vol.6 for those who want more of the cartoons that were shown on television. If you are not a collector of vintage cartoons of an era, than this collection is not for you.sg"
3,"Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol.6",Most of the cartoons were great but the one's about the war could have been left out of the collections.
1,Sorriest of all the first 6 collection sets,"I love Looney Tunes cartoons, except for most of the ones on volume 6. I'm a Bugs and friends person, and I do not like the old, forgotten, Disney knockoff, original characters. Most of this stuff is from that lot of toons. The 'extras' contained a few that I liked, but most of the rest were skipped.If you like Bugs, Elmer, Porky, Sylvester, Tweety, and friends, but don't like old black and white characters that are basically Disney clones, don't waste your money! I only paid $23 for volume 6, and that was $22 too much!"
4,Classic movies of the 1950's,These 2 films are clear as the day they were shown in the theatres.... however they are definitely (B) movies the entertainment value is not much... However I can enjoy an old movie with no apparent plot just for the ambience of the time.... I love old Black & White movies and there are less and less people around to appreciate this lost art.
4,80s Music Nostalgia,This is a compilation of songs that most of us who grew up during the 80s heard at some point during the decade. The question of whether or not to get this CD depends entirely on your opinion of the band when they were making records. If you had cassettes or vinyl from this band you are going to find tracks you enjoyed. If you are doing research on music from the 80s this is also a nice sampler of this particular band. Fans of Boy George old and new will want this because this is where he got his start. I grew up in the 80s and had a cassette or two of Culture Club and would get vinyl of them from the library. I may have to go hunting for CDs of the individual cassettes I had but this is a good overview of what the group accomplish when it was still performing.
4,love it,got it on time! great gift for the next generation to learn more about the 80s shipped with time to spare
3,The House is the Star,"As a fan of the movie with Myrna Loy and Cary Grant, I decided the give the book a try. Although it omits some of the movie's funniest gags, the book has its share of laughs, but doesn't flow as well.Despite its short length (just over 200 pages) I find that it read slowly, and that I looked upon the last few chapters as a chore rather than a delight.I attribute this mostly to the fact that the book's chief characters, the Blandings, are relatively lifeless. They are overshadowed by, and much less interesting, than the cast of locals that make building their country home the difficult and amusing tale it is."
1,Vent Visor for 09 Honda Pilot,"I ordered this product and verified it would fit my model. When it arrived, found that the packaging said 2003-2008 for the year. It will NOT fit the 2009 Honda Pilot. Had to return it."
5,My favorite of the series,I was devastated when His Lordship died but this one carries on his life and love for Jane. I suggest to everyone that this series be read in the order written.
1,Not a good buy,"This product looks great, but when i went to use it, i discovered that the cap at end of the barrel was not adhered to the body. Now it is worthless"
4,Another great product!,"I use this once a day to scrub off the dry, dead skin off my face and it works wonderfully! It leaves my skin so smooth. After this I follow with my 3 Step System and my skin is so soft! It's a must have for me!"
3,Nice,Good product but does not remove completely. Leaves skin soft to the touch. Not a very good smell kinda medicinally
4,Extremely Pleased With This Item,"I received the product much sooner than expected, thanks to the extremely fast shipping. It looks great on my camera, a Nikon D70s, and fits my hand beautifully. The only drawback would be if you had extra large hands. If the strap is loosened too close to the end of the strap, it can work it's way loose, as I found out while wearing gloves. I didn't drop my camera, but it was close. This was remedied by tightening the strap another 1/4"", and it's been great ever since. I give it my highest recommendation."
4,Good little tool,For the price I didn't expect it to come with nice soft touch base contacting my camera.The design is simple and does what it is supposed to do.
3,Camera Hand Grip,Easy to attach to the camera. Awkward to use when taking vertical photos. It's difficult to reach the shutter button.
2,Beware - reprint of an old book,I purchased this took and then found that it was just a reprint from several decades ago
3,disappointed,"I'm so mad that I opened the package, threw away the wrapping and then cracked one because the stupid thing was too long. It did not fit like the add said. So I recommend trying your fit before throwing away the packing."
4,Good basics,A good introduction to Dressage. I found it an easy read when i was 12 and still enjoy it. HOwever there are a few major flaws- ie the shoulder in developing past 3 lines of travel to four-. I found most of the dressage to be more based off eventing dressage levels. And the photo's were very eventing based. GOod boook though.
1,Can't Recommend Oblivion,"I had just read ""The Walking Dead: Rise of The Governor"" and really liked it so I decided to pick up another book by Jay Bonansinga. Wow, was I disappointed. The writing was so repetitive I started to skim through chapters just to finish it and get to the ending. I should have stopped reading because the ending wasn't worth it. I wasn't just disappointed in the ending, I was appalled. I guess Bonansinga needs Robert Kirkman to guide him."
2,Poor Code; Where is Visual basic 6?,"I bought this book becasuse of the last 4 reviews but unfourunatlly this book start for 2 chapters for stage 1 too beginner, suddenly the author jumbs to classes then no where because he selected within his book some examples I don't know how and where he thought to use it for demonstration a very important points for programmers? Don't buy this book If you are interested like me for ActiveX , Databases and Visual Basic 6 Features."
5,Excellent Visual Basic Book!,"This book is an excellent book on Visual Basic. I am surprised that it has not received more reviews and ranks so lowly on the amazon.com sales list. It is far better than some of the more popular Visaul Basic books, especially books intended for beginners. Peter Aitken is not only a good writer, he is also a good teacher. I recommend this book wholeheartedy to all of you Visual Basic beginners. I am certain this book will become more popular when the word gets out how good it is."
2,Poor support and large restrictions,"I also attempted to upgrade this computer to Vista Ultimate. Sony even includes a flyer in the box on how to proceed with a WindowsAnytimeUpgrade to Ultimate. That doesn't even phase the support group who just recite their talking point that only Vista Home Premium is supported.There are good features for High definition editting and Blu-Ray disk creation, but my WinDVD BD player has mysteriously stopped playing commercial Blu-Ray disks twice now. Just as mysteriously the functionality returns after days of experimenting with options to find out what's making it fail. I still have no clue as to what the problem is."
3,Seems a step back from the quality of the second book,"I found that I kept putting this book down and did not want to pick it back up. I couldn't care less about the main character or the ""innocent"" accused (who else figure out the farm hand was the girl's father in the first couple of chapters.) The men who arrived to date Sarah Booth were somewhat amusing but then again, what gives with this? Is the author trying to convince us that her main character is so alluring that men flock to her. I'm not convinced. I still enjoy Tinkie (rich, daddy's girl). I still feel that the ex-slave ghost is annoying and frankly, somewhat insulting to black women. Why is this ghost so determined to have Sarah Booth get pregnant. I purchased the other books in this series in hopes that the author would improve over time. I am hoping that I don't regret the purchase."
3,"Not bad, but not unisex","I bought a couple of inexpensive 1440s for a recent sailing trip since my wife and I didn't want to risk damaging/losing our more expensive timepieces. Initial thoughts: this model is described as ""unisex"" but is much too small for a man, plus the small size makes it challenging to set even with instructions. The date display can be tough to see in bright sunlight. I do, however, like the Indiglo feature, and the red accents look good. Overall, not a bad option if you're looking for a low-cost, sports watch. UPDATE: After wearing it for awhile, my wife loves it. Go figure."
5,Great watch for my son,"Bought this for my 10 year old son. Better than expected, I can't wait for him to open it on Christmas."
5,timex takes a licking and keeps on ticking,I dont need to say any thing more than Timex. The watch keeps going but the band breaks after several years of my son
5,Timex watch review,"So far , so good. The sports oriented girl that received it loved it. All is well with the world now."
4,Great First Watch for a Kid,"Bought this for my 11 year old, and he loves it. East to use, and he loves to play with the alarm settings. Thanks goodness that the alarm isn't too annoying. He feels very grown up now that he has a watch. And when, not if, he ends up losing it, it won't be much to replace."
3,Smaller than I thought,I bought this as a watch to wear to save on my nice watch. When I got it I was a little disappointed that it was so small - I am a big guy and it looked very dainty on my wrist. But the quality is very good.
2,Not Great,"My daughter bought this watch with her own money and loved it while it was working. She was very disappointed when, for no reason, the watch started fogging up. I called Mr. Watch (the company we bought it from) and they said it should stop. Of course, it didn't. It actually got worse to the point that the numbers started disappearing. At this point, we couldn't return it to Mr. Watch but had to send it to timex for repair."
5,well-written,This book was one of the best I've ever read. It was a real tear-jerker. It was extremely well-written- I've read it many times
5,DEFINITE HEARTBREAKER!!!!,"Lurlene is sssooo awesome. She knows how to write books in the view of a teenager. Her stories are that of which we can relate to. This, I have to admit was #1 on my list. It is full of suspense, happiness, joy, lotz and lotz of love, and ends in a tragedy. Have your box a tissues handy because it's a definite tear-jerker! Keep up the good work Lurlene!! I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone who has lost someone that they truly loved."
5,My FAVORITE book!!!,This was the first Lurlend McDaniel book that I read. I loved it so much that I went to the library and got all the Lurlene McDaniel books they had! I still read the new books she comes out with and they are great. Just wonderful!
4,This is the best book ever!!,"Don't Die, My Love is the best book I have ever read!! I have only read it 1 time, but I am going to read it again soon.I have read 9 or 10 of the books written by Lurlene McDaniel, and Don't Die, My Love is definitely my favorite!! I almost cried at parts of it. And I never cry when I am reading a book. This is a great book, and if you have never read it then you should go to the library or the bookstore and pick up a copy right now!! All of the books by Lurlene McDaniel are great!!...P.S. I would recommend the book Saving Jessica by Lurlene McDaniel"
4,Good things turn bad,"Don't Die, My Love is a really enjoyable book. You never get bored with it. Having read many books by Lurlene McDaniel, I think this is one of her best works. It truly makes you look at your own life and how you would act during a situation like they were put in throughout the story. The story is about a boy named Luke, who had everything going for him in his life. He has had the same girlfriend for many years. He is a really good quarterback and promising colleges recruit. But while he was on top of the world, horror strikes. He found a lump on his throat. Now is is in real trouble. He then finds himself in the hospital. The doctors start to run many tests to find out what is really wrong with him. Just as things are starting to work out, they end up getting bad again. You will be surprised and very eager to see how the story will finally end. The story is full of many ups and downs. You have to read it!"
5,"Don't Die, My Love","Julie Ellis and Luke Muldenhower have been together since the eighth grade. Now they are in high school and are deeply in love. Luke is a football player, whose coach is Julie's father. Luke is about to receive an athletic scholarship to a top college and is very excited about it.All of a sudden, Luke gets an infection inside his body and Julie commands him to go see a doctor, who tells him that what he's seeing doesn't look right and that Luke's infection is more than what he thinks. As the days at the hospital passed by, things with Luke's body grew and everything about it worries Julie too much. All Julie wants right now is for everything to be fine in the end. But will she get what she wishes for?""Don't Die, My Love"" is a wonderful, romantic, and realistic fiction story that brings out all of the deep feelings of two teenagers in love. It is a great book for those who love the realistic plots and for those who love romance.-Hannah"
3,A very romantic and heart felt book,This book is very intresting. If you decide that you like this author you may want to wait a while before you read another one of her books. they become very predictibe and somewhat boring after reading about two or three of them
5,One of Lurlene McDaniel's best!,"I have read numerous books by Lurlene McDaniel, and I can't say one is much better than the other. In my opinion, they are all her best! They all touched my heart and kept me thinking."
2,Waste of money,"I was very UNimpressed with these makeup sponges. Althougth the description specifically said they would not fall apart, surprise surprise, they did...almost immediately."
3,Return to the Edge of the Federation Fontier,"In this, the first novel of DS9 set after the events of the television series, we are once again taken back to the Federation Frontier. Here we meet the new characters who are taking the places of the characters who exited the series in the final episode.Although this first book is very much a ""set-up"" novel, getting the plot started and introducing the new characters, it is by no means an empty book. Just exploring the new characters would be good, but there's a decent plot around this novel as well - the station, gutted for refitting that is way overdue, ends up under attack again by forces that might be the Dominion. Renewed aggression? Rebels? The tale is well set, the characters are well written, and the plot just gets better...This book definately does the DS9 crew and setting justice, and I'd reccommend it."
5,Outstanding,"For fans of DS9, this is a must! It continues the story seamlessly and you feel as if you are transported back to the Station with all the characters. You can actually visualize what would be happening, even with new scenes and characters. I couldn't put it down once I started. Glad I bought the second volume so I wouldn't have to wait to finish the episode. Looking forward to the next installment."
2,What were they thinking?,I was looking forward to more Deep Space 9 but this is not Deep Space 9. The TV characters are way off from how they were on the show and the new characters are stuck in badly and are just lame.I gave it two stars instead of one because the writing is pretty good but the author should go do something else and not spend his time doing Deep Space 9 wrong.
5,Grandchildren Love It..,"This is a Great addition to our game room! Easy for children to play, and good value for the price."
4,Bagpipes Maximus,"Of the three In Extremo albums I have, this is my favorite. The songs are a little slower and tend more towards hard rock than on the other albums. Basically what you get is early metal style hard rock with bagpipes, and guttural, German sounding vocals. Supposedly the songs are all traditional from various cultures, and the musicians made their own bagpipes. Great for dancing around the bonfire."
4,Muggeridge on the 1930s,"Published in 1940 before the full fury of Nazi Germany struck Great Britain, Muggeridge shares his insights and personal philosophy with his country as backdrop. Don't look for a detailed account of issues and events but rather an overview of a momentous decade which in the author's view brought out the worst in human nature. Now remote personages such as MacDonald, Baldwin and Chamberlain are brought sharply into focus. The author also tries to explain why men such as Churchill were marginalized most of the decade. Muggeridge dwells at length on culture high and low, religious trends, social behavior and the quirks of British society. Not taken in by Stalin, as were many contemporary intellectuals, he finds little to commend in Soviet society but states bluntly that Hitler mirrored the aspirations of the mass of Germans as much as FDR did for Americans. This is a highly literate, highly personal account of a watershed in 20th century civilization."
3,UK Soul has caught my ear!!,"Omar along with Julie Dexter have had my ears open for real soul music from London and the entire U.K. for many years now. Now I'm introduced to Ms Beverly Knight, a soulful voice with a lot of power behind it. The production isn't the best in the business but her voice out shines it anyway. ""A.W.O.L."" is one of my favorite tracks on this CD. It has a slow smooth vibe that's beggin for a syncronist head bob of it's bass felt track. Another Import that's worth the money.oNe"
1,CHEAP product! Avoid this product!!,"The positive reviewers for this product are shills for Cavalry. Check all their reviews and see they just post good reviews for all Cavalry products. The Cavalry products are cheaply made, loud, and unreliable."
4,Surprisingly good,"I took a chance on this expecting it to be similar to styling waxes I've used, but it's not. It's a very runny consistency, like honey, rather than like wax. A bit messy to work with, really, if you're not used to it. As a former user of Redken's Water Wax 03 it took me a while to get the hang of this stuff.I touch the tips of my fingers to the surface of the product, then rub my fingertips together to distribute it, and use it to piece out the ends of my shaggy bob.This product is also very good for a trick my stylist taught me. Put a very small amount on your fingertips, put your fingertips in your hair near the roots, and press down on the scalp while rubbing back and forth quickly over a very small area (like scrubbing). This adds lift at the roots which lasts a long time!"
5,Extra Practice Test Included,"I just recently took the GRE (2005) and this book was the best thing that I could have found. Contrary to the other reviews, the practice test in this book is different from the one that you will be sent upon registering for the test (they now send the 2000 version for free). On top of that they include extra practice questions grouped by subject area. The only downfall is that they don't provide detailed explinations, but the questions were completely representative of the kind that were on my exam. This is the only GRE Chemistry study book that I would recommend. It's worth the money."
2,Campy Halloween Party Fun for MST3K fans!,"What I wouldn't give to see what the gang from MST3K could do to this one. You will shriek in horror and howl hysterically! This not-so classic fright-fest starred Tom Hanks well before he had a copious choice of film projects. The plot is dreadfully simple, and simply dreadful. A Fantasy Role-Playing game drives a college dweeb to insanity when the players take it too far for his fragile little psyche to withstand, proving that even the highest of the Hollywood echelon had to just pay the rent sometimes. This mock-worthy made for TV movie aired in 1982 and had audiences wondering why they were watching this crap in the first place. Mazes and Monsters did for Dungeons and Dragons what Reefer Madness did for marijuana. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll kiss 75 minutes of your life good-bye! Get this for your next party with your wittiest friends and have some hearty laughs. You'll be glad you did."
5,Skinwalker a Five Star Read,Authors Kelleher and Knapp have written an incredible account about bizarre events at a remote Utah ranch. Paranormal events like this are often frustrating for the storytellers because there are no neat answers that bring the whole story to a final conclusion. Five stars for their backgrounding and colorful detail - including an interesting review of the paranormal from a regional aspect. Whatever is going on out there is obviously one step ahead of the observers. Strongly recommended if you have any interest in the paranormal. Stephen King should take notes. This is one book that should be adapted into a film.
2,Science Confronts the Unexplained and looses.,"As a long time UFO researcher/investigator I have to agree with ""a researcher's"" review. I cant say it better.I was very dissappointed in the book. I thought that after five years of investigation NIDS would have collected some usefull data. They claim they didnt. I dont buy it.The book reads like a mystery. Good for bedtime reading."
2,"If Ackroyd is an English literary light, this is ten watts","I confess that this is the only book I have read by Ackroyd, but it may be the last one. Zero character development, an odd plot line pompous writing style and and a dismally incomplete finish.The historical setting deserved the two stars."
2,"Very confusing, surreal tale..","""Hawksmoor"" by Peter Ackroyd was the first one I read by him, and I almost didn't want to read another. I can see from previous reviews that opinion was mixed. I did like what Ackroyd attempted: a story with an eighteenth century feel( The language in that part got on my nerves after a while) with an interesting antihero at the center. The premise that Nicolas Dyer, who designed churches, was a Satanist is both ironic and very original. That is one of the few strong points in the novel. The police detective who is investigating a series of murder is also interesting. Basically, he discovers that the killings are supernatural and echo Dyer's murders years before. The ending was what ruined the whole novel. What was the point of it? So Dyer and Hawksmoor are staring at each other through time, is in a mirror?"
2,"Evocative foundation on historical London, but little else","I have been trying to read this book, on and off, for nearly ten years. The time could have been put to better use.Ackroyd does an admirable job of evoking post-plague London in both sense-detail and in diction, style, and vagarities of spelling. But his modern London, and the detective who gives his name to the title, are flat, expressionless, and - worse yet - ring false. The detective portion of the novel is especially ineffective, and the police procedures depicted seem shallow and poorly researched. Above all else, the quest for evil, if there was one, was transparent to this reader.The chapters set in London-past are what drives the two stars in this review. Alas, better depictions of the historical city and its people can be found in any of Neil Gaiman's 'Sandman' graphic novels."
4,Nice,"The sweater came quickly, but the buttons were loose and I had to sew them on. For the price I think this was not made as nicely as it should have been."
4,Calling The Talent,"It seemed like I waited forever for the second Rooney album to come out but I have to say it was worth the wait, cuz I do love those boys. I knew I would love it, as I am addicted (still) to the band's debut album from a few years ago. Full of sing songy choruses and some self depreciating lyrics, this group of young musicians constantly surprise me. They are so talented in a land full of some not so talented young people in the music business.Every song is catchy, and not sugary syrupy silly, but actually intelligent. In fact the musicianship of Rooney always throws me for a loop because they are so good. There isn't a song I don't like on this CD and these days that's a hard thing to say. Best cuts: ""Calling the World"", ""When Did Your Heart Go Missing"" , ""Love Me Or Leave Me"""
3,Good,It's a good CD. Not my favorite but good.But that depends on your taste in music.Good and speedy service.
4,Overall a good read,"This book was enjoyable enough to keep your interest, but Alexandra's ""ohmygods"" do irritate sometimes. Alexandra falls in love with Xavier before she even meets him and gets to know his personality. Time travel books usually don't intrigue me, but this one was good. However, during a time of slavery in Tripoli, Alexandra did not use a whole lot of sense and did not think about possible consequences to some of her escapades. I was disappointed to find out Xavier continues to think she is a spy. I plan to read the sequel to find out if he changes his opinion and find out more about her handsome servant in the harem, Murad, and his descendent (possibly?), Joseph."
3,Outdated,The book is a basic knife fighting book. The pictures are all black and white and take in the 80's.
4,You can see the green!,"Some purists insists these old classics be kept black and white as filmed. I can understand that, and, in theory, agree, but I found the quality of this colorized version of The Woman in Green remarkable! If I wasn't already aware of the movie I would think it had been filmed in color! I think it adds to the viewing experience, making the characters more life-like and believeable. It helps bring the menance of the mutilated London murder victims, oddly missing a finger, seem even more subtle, yet immediately menacing and you can still enjoy the original version also on this disk if your prefer. Highly recommended."
4,Holmes Squares Off Against the Best Moriarty,"Yes, after having seen Lionel Atwill and George Zucco step up to the plate as the nefarious master criminal Moriarty, I can safely say that Henry Daniell brings the most to the role. ....As slight as the story line may be (hypnotized men of means/rank are made to believe they committed murder and then are blackmailed), I must recommend you study the acting very carefully. Rathbone (Holmes), Bruce (Watson) and Daniell (Moriarty) are really doing an awful lot in the way of characterization. I love how Rathbone just hides a smile when he looks at the dunderheadings of Bruce.... These men are real pros, imbuing the scene with real tension. Daniell is particularly good, when his mouth drawn up grimly as he spars verbally with Rathbone. ...I enjoyed ""The Woman in Green"" much more than I had expected to, thanks to the first-rate acting. Nice to know that some childhood favorites still hold up when you see them years later!"
2,Not very long lived.,"Bought my 206 last year from a friend who had only used it for a few months. The camera was well cared for and was in original packaging. The camera lasted me less than a year before it started failing intermittently. Finally last week it crashed and won't come back up at all. It shows a green light until I plug it into the network whereupon the orange fail light starts flashing. It's not accessible over the network. (Yes, I tried resetting it, restarting it and all the troubleshooting steps on Axis' web site and a few other things--wasted a lot of time on it.)Before that I was very pleased with the camera--good interface, good picture quality, very nice low-light image. The downward-facing LAN jack is a little annoying as the LAN cable tends to tip the camera over. I fixed that by mounting the camera stand to a heavier wood base. I'm debating whether to buy a new one--I can't afford to be buying these every year. What ever happened to the 3 year warranty on electronics?"
3,Plodding Review of the Historic Season,"After being enthralled by ""Luckiest Man"" by Mr. Eig, I was excited to find that he had another book coming out. The problem with this book is that it cannot decide what it wants to be. It is a quality account of Jackie Robinson's tumultuous first year in the big leagues. However, it takes many detours. It gets sidetracked by entire chapters devoted to those on the periphery of that season. Granted, there were many issues that affected Jackie Robinson's first year in Brooklyn, but none that merit an entire chapter. That said, it does capture the mood around the time and is respectable; just not all I had hoped for."
5,Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003,"Even though I thought I knew everything about Disneyland and the rest of the Resort, I found new and interesting things in this book. And now I know so much more, then I did, before I read this book.Also I think this book is very helpful to a person who has never visited Disneyland, and to the person who visited the park 20 times or more. (Like I have) I do have to say I did find some mistakes in the book, but they were minor. Overall this book is very helpful and is very informitive."
1,Piece of garbage,This tire pump arrived at my home and was broken within 2 days (I tried to pump up the tires on my daughter's Schwinn jogging stroller). It was so cheap that I just threw it out. I would NOT recommend anyone purchasing this item.
1,Poor Design,Same issue as many other posters. Both of mine snapped and broke on first attempt at using them in a wine bottle. Look elsewhere for a wine stopper.
1,Is that all there is?,"This is not the book that i was looking for to help me to conquer a less than optimistic outlook on the world. I've read and own hundreds of books on various subjects and this is the literary runt of the litter. Insight? I've read better on bathroom walls. Skip it or better yet, read it in the store and make up your own mind. Fluff."
2,Full of gaps and scattered.,"This book is not very easy to follow. The author seems quite unable to sustain one train of thought for any length of time. He seems to jump from topic to topic and back again without fully covering any of them. There are lots of examples, but very little discription of what they are or why you would use them. This is not a book that I would reccomend to anyone trying to learn Visual C++."
2,"English is good, Code is bad","If one could extract Mr. Sphar's descriptions of what MFC is and how applications can use it to interact with Windows, the result would be well worth reading. Unfortunately, this is only a small part of what this book attempts to do. The sample code does not conform to basic standards of good programming (in variable names, style, and clarity), making it difficult to read and grating on the nerves. Since Mr. Sphar attempts to teach by example, this is a critical shortcoming. In addition, when the discussion turns to the inner workings of C (I'm thinking here about the section on pointers and function arguments), Mr. Sphar spends too much time on technical minutia and too little on building intuition. The O'Riley _Practical Programming_ books do a better job of teaching C and C++, and I'm going to look for a better introduction to MFC."
2,A Waste,"I really tried to put this item to use but it was a big waste of space. It makes seeing an item really difficult. What makes it worse is no one else in the family wants it-can't even give it away. Goodwill, here it comes. Maybe they can get a couple of bucks for it."
1,Hitchcock's great. Secret Agent isn't.,"Boring, tedious, occasionally hard to follow, unsuspensefull.It get's a star because Gene or Greg Something (the guy who played ""The General"") was great."
1,DOA ouch!,"My unit arived with screws loose and one screw missing. When I pluged it in to my computer it gave an error c10. It kept cutting in and out on my computer trying to open a usb channel but never showed up as a drive on my computer. When I tried to find a mfgr website for advice, I could not find Cavalry! I now must return the unit.My advice stay away from companys without websites."
5,Best of all the books that I have read in this field,"I have purchased 16 of these books and have yet to own one. People borrow them and I never get them back.The beginning is a little tough because it is new terminology, setting the foundation for what is to come. You can skip around. He gets to the point quickly and concisely. I guess I will have to buy book number 17. Haven't got this last one back either."
5,Scripts People Live,"I never write reviews but this book was so incredible. Comprehensive and yet specific enough to give people serious insight into their unconscious decisions and how to change that. Mr. Steiner examines how society promulgates and promotes certain behaviors as well as our parents, teachers, etc. etc. This book is a must read for anyone truly interested in the inner-workings of themselves and others. VERY ENLIGHTENING!"
5,Fantastic fun,"As with almost everyone else, my wife and I went wild for this song when we first heard it in Tuscany. When we got to St. Tropez we had to persuade the DJ at the disco in the Byblos to play it, of course the whole place erupted, its totally fun and a great song."
5,A music fan just returned from Europe.,"I just came back from a trip in Europe. I visited Nice, France and Bucharest, Romania. The song was all day long, all over the places, and is very funny and uplifting. So I was very happy to listen the song in New York at 103.5 station. America is going to love the song."
1,"this book is a very early translation, later translations are a lot better.","This book on Enoch does not make enough connections with the bible,in easy to read format, to be fair this is a very early translation. It does not for example, list all the fallen angels in the text."
5,You get what you pay for,I've been using the heck out of this filter in the past year and a half. It has never let me down and I have yet to find a complaint about it. I can see myself utilizing this for a very long time. Excellent product and definitely worth the investment.
5,2nd one I bought,"I have two of these, bought from Amazon. Cna not stress the Importance of this Item as it relates to Liberty. Everytime I ordered form Amazon, it came fast and Right as Rain. This si the best filter to have. And Liberty can not be secured without safe access to water, Food, Shelter and security. This Item takes care of your First need as a Heterotroth, Water. And can do so for a long time. All Packs should have one of these in them."
5,A+ Drinking water whereever you go,"I must say the Katadyn Pocket Water Filter is by far the best water filter/purifier I have ever purchased. I've used several different ones that mounted on the sink, but required filter changes every other month. Even though the Katadyn was more expensive at first, over the long run and also the portability, this is the most inexpensive, highest quaility filter out there. I did a little math and the Katadyn said it will filter over 13000 gallons of drinkable water.That figures to over 83200 20oz. bottle of water, which would make 3466 cases. At $5.99 a case, that is over $20700. Therefore over time, you would saveover $20500, and that doesn't include the savings in recyclable plastic bottles.I Can't say enough good things about the Katadyn and am rating this a AA++ times 10. Well done Katadyn and well done to Amazon for oferring such a great product at reasonable price."
3,Test Before Using,"Purchased the Pocket Filter prior to a river trip during May 2012. On the first use the device failed, fortunately we had a backup filter and were able to continue. On return to Phoenix I contacted Katadyn customer service and explained my problem with the filter. I was told that the filter could not have failed and that disassembly in the field had caused lost parts. Well not exactly, but okay I caused the filter to fail. Next the base was examined and yes a pin and ball bearing check valve assembly was missing. Please I begged can you send me replacement parts and I can repair my 6 week old filter. After two weeks and a second request I have no repair parts and I wasted $270.00 plus shipping on a worthless filter. Bottom line is this, the Katadyn CSR was rude during both contacts with her and I still have a worthless filter. Both attempts to resolve the situation were met with scorn and rudness, buy from this company at your own risk!"
4,Great Product,This is a great product I would have given it a 5 Star rating but it is expensive. I can only say you get what you pay for.
5,Very Compact and Useful,"This is the only model of compact water filter I could find that doesn't require frequent filter changes. A little steep in price, but that concern goes out the window when you need clean water."
1,The Enron of Korea...,"Kim, like most Korean cheabols, built their companies from scratch thru dirt-cheap government loans and a protectionist environment that shielded their companies from competition at the expense of the consumer. After the bankruptcy of Daewoo dutrng the Asian Financial crisis, Kim has already fled his native country and is now living under a French passport since Korea doesn't have any extradition powers over France to get him. Kim is now a infamous and a shame to all Korean people and every business person would do well to learn from his mistakes."
5,Just offering my opinion. What's yours?,Hohner slightly less leaky than a Lee Oscar but both easy to bend and I love each.
5,you must have one or more of these,"i think it is one of the best harmonicas for a first harp, or for general practice. rather cheap, but still sound awesome (looks cool), easy to play, because of the big holes, and what is important for beginner (intermediate) blues/rock harpers, is that it is one of the easiest bending harps!!! (well, the low key also helps).if you are buying your (or someone's) first harp, then think no more, this is what you want to buy! (although might not in this key, but if the genre is either blues or rock than this or a D-harp is what i'd recommend. otherwise a C.)"
3,Analyzing Political Theory,"Myself, SUKANT VYAS,am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, Dyal Singh (Evening) College of the University of Delhi, India and I also teach postgraduate students - Liberal Politicl Theory and Marxist Political Theory. I have reviewed many books on political theory specifically and have written research articles. This particular book has by now become a handbook for me as a teacher of political science. I do not think there is any better comment for this very useful book for all the scholars of political science. This book is recommended for all interested in politics."
5,And for those who want a daily reminder....,"EARTH FROM ABOVE, the important photographic portfolio with accompanying essays by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, has met with such a wide receptive audience that the publishers have created this small scale 'calendar book' EARTH FROM ABOVE: 366 DAYS which gives a photograph and essay on each of the works viewed in the larger tome on separate pages for each day of the year. The message remains the same - and here it is one for daily contemplation: we are the caretakers of the planet Earth and these stunning visual reminders will hopefully alert us all to the importance of our guardianship. A perfect gift, especially to the young ones on your list! Grady Harp, December 2004"
3,Most extensive of it's kind.,"Most extensive of it's kind as I know having a full year of pictures but I was trying to reach a bigger format book among the many editions on this title, just consider that, but very good content."
2,DVD drive,"The DVD drive can only play movies. If you need a laptop for study purpose, it can't open the CD that comes with your textbook. I have called the SONY customer support, and the only answer I got was they're working on it."
3,"Good, But too small...","When i got my GBA i got a ton of accessories and this case was one of them. It does a good job at protecting your GBA, but it seems it does'nt have enough room for the unit, games,and accessories."
4,"Pretty good, but you might want a bigger case...","This is a perfect case for me because I don't want to carry around a big bulky bag. The front pocket is for the game boy(it wont fit if you have a light shield attatched to it) and the back pocket is for games. I can fit atleast six games(with cases). If you dont have the cases you could probably fit a lot more. There's rooms for batteries and I have little micro cloth thing to clean the screen. It works great for me, but if you are looking for a bag to carry allll your game boy stuff, then its not for you.(why i only gave it 4 stars) I just use it to carry a few games when I go somewhere."
2,hammer to the head,"linney hits a single note (over and over) with his position that god is a cruel host who sets up his party of life with one goal in mind: to make people suffer. a priest is torn between his love for god on the one side and his lust on the other. an unbearable predicament, the priest eventually falls into violent action, action for which linney would have us believe there is no alternative. if you are like me and don't believe in playing the victim, if you believe in taking responsibility for yourself, and if you can think of better things to do with your time and spirit than blame god for everything, then you will find this play slightly infuriating--and no matter what your personal outlook, you are sure to find it boring."
2,There is no on/off switch.,There is no on/off switch! That's drives us crazy when we need put this toy away and it still makes noises.
4,works great less pricy,"Bought this knife for deer skinning and general hunting purposes. It came to my house very sharp and held it's edge very well through everyhing from string to potatoes, and skinning a deer. Needs a touch up now but for less than $15.00 it is a great deal."
4,Bathory's Viking Metal,"Quorthon invented viking metal and this his second to last album in that style. Not really anti religous, but as his job he was toying witb the audience. This established Bathory as legitimate and was regarded the most by the critics for his neo classical approach to it and it his very heavy and exotic at the same time."
5,BATHORY,"This is my first Bathory cd, and not the last. It's a very heavy album, nice acoustic solo's, that of which Eric Clapton or Santana would be proud of. Nicely done drum set up(someone knows how to play evedently, some drummers in this genre only pound their double bass drums and symbols w/out any rythem, except Nick Barker'Cradle of Filth,Dimmu Borgir,Old Man's Child). Only problem I had with this cd, is that the first three tracks are all compiled onto the first track, and Hammerheart splits into track 5 and 6, 6 being 23 seconds long. Not a problem, if I'm going to listen to this cd, it's either the whole thing through, or Hammerheart(superb song, with nice orchestral backing). If you are any type of fan of Bathory, this is a must for any fan. If you are just getting into them I would recommend this as well, I've heard pretty much all Bathory, but this is my first purchased cd. It's worth the money."
4,More of a straight jazz CD than Cassandra Wilson CD,"This CD can be confusing in a couple of areas- first the packaging is too similar to another Coleman release. Read the title and check the song list before purchasing. Second, some may classify it as a Cassandra Wilson CD as she sings on 3 tracks. Let's point out that she doesn't appear at all on 5 tracks and that the 3 songs she's on are pretty evenly divided between vocal and instrumental parts. So this would not be a good starting point for a Wilson fan. To enjoy this CD, an appreciation of jazz that's a little avant garde or expiremental would be neccessary. It's not for everyone."
4,Great CD!,"This CD has loads of coo songs on it. Love the 2nd CD! This CD is from a series of ""Bravo"" CD's from Germany... I have others from the collection, and they're all purrfect!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Groo and Chakaal. Well, Groo wants it to be Groo and Chakaal. Chakaal is a woman that is pretty handy with the pigstickers herself, and, her brain actually works. There is no chance that she would ever be in love with Groo. Or, at least you would hope so. A besotted brainless cheese dipping barbarian is pretty funny though."
2,Jack-In-The-Pulpit Review,Nah! This book portrays the church in a negative way. A preacher should be a positive influence on a prostitute and not engage in a sexual relationship with her.
3,Difference between AT-PL120 & AT-PL120-S Turntables,"Just in case you may be confused about the difference between the Audio-Technica AT-PL120 and the AT-PL120-S Turntables -- the only difference is that the AT-PL120-S is the AT-PL120 Turntable bundled with software for converting your vinyl records to CD's and the AT-PL-120 is not. That is all! Is the software worth the added $30.00 cost of the AT-PL120-S vs the AT-PL-120? Only you can say for sure. It also is the only turntable I have found with direct drive (no belt slippage), and 33, 45 and 78 rpm capabilities (some get 78 through software manipulation)."
5,Miss Melville Regrets,"I love these Miss Melville stories. I can't believe that there are not more of them. This one I had purchased as a gift because I refuse to part with my only copy even as a loan!The idea behind them is hysterical and they are so well written! Evelyne E. Smith, where are you?Bring more on! Connie"
4,"Oh, But She's a Little Old Lady","She goes to a hotel, avoids people like her, in fancy dress, who are rating prospective association dinners, and then the speaker at the not-very-good meal is dead.And the little old lady ""sells"" the painting she's just created to a handsome man -- for a lot of money. And hands him the gun she's just used.So goes the life of a professional hit-woman who blundered into the job.Fun reading -- her rationalizations (the victim is always somebody loathsome); her painting; her associates, some of them good friends, some snobs, some dinner-crashers. And the tension when one part of her life merges into another.You'll smile all the way through."
4,Some Days The Magic Works; Some Days It Don't,Great book on the experiments performed in how far the mind can be influenced using dream telepathy.Some of the studies involved situations like whether or not people could influence what other's dreamed. Not all the experiments were successful. These guys were definitely outside the box on this one.Worth reading!
4,Voyage of the Basset,"This book reminded me of the illustrated books for Dinotopia (which I love dearly). Of course this isn't about dinosaurs but the concept is the same. A fantasy journey of sorts with captivating pictures and journal notes added here and there. I wish I would have known about this book when I was younger but none the less I still enjoyed it as an adult. I think the pictures help the story out a lot, without them I would have been less likely to actually pick the book up."
2,Disappointing,I had read good reviews of this CD so was disappointed when the music was more irritating than joyful. I suppose there are some interesting moments. B
3,Dreaming of an Arizona vacation??,"In a new twist on the poor little rich girl story, our female lead character's deceased grandfather whops a load of serious tough love on his playgirl daughter. Hmm..maybe I should forward a copy of this novel to Paris Hilton's grandfather... By forcing the now penniless playgirl to connect with the ""real"" world and some charming ""real"" characters (loving Latino family), serious, handsome, hardworking, male lead hotel manager the expected maturity and appreciation for the stuff of life occurs. The setting is in Arizona and the descriptions of gorgeous desert views, add another layer of interest. Nothing particularly special here--just good journeyman level, well crafted contemporary romance."
3,Handy but not perfect,"This is very handy to have in the garden since it fits in your pocket and you can carry pruning shears without the danger of stabbing yourself, but the shears themselves are passable at best. I like being able to open a bag of soil, loosen some roots of a plant I am transplanting or do a quick trim without carrying lots of tools with me, but if you are doing heavy duty pruning or weeding, you are going to want to use a different tool. It gets a 5 stars for concept, but only 3 in execution."
5,Rock solid.,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She is one of Alabama's Master Gardeners. She takes this thing every where she goes.She has her regular tools for home, but the Alabama MGs do a lot of volunteer work and you never know what tool you're going to need.She has been very impressed and loves the tool. Therefore, obviously, I do as well."
3,"Nice introduction to the sport, but not much more.","This is a nice book for someone looking to get into agility. Lots of good photos, and information on the obstacles, the various organizations, etc. Good information on preparing to go to your first show. Not much here for the experienced competitor."
2,Doesn't last long,"This foot dimmer switch is easy to use and worked fine--for six months. I expected it to last longer.Also, what I received doesn't look like the photo."
4,Weekend at the Cabin blood and action,Weekend at the Cabin alot of action and blood. If you like cabin movies and slashing watch this one. You will be in a different mode and scene when watching. Unlike predictable cabin movies this one has better scenes and dialogue. Different than the rest.
2,don<t bother with one,movie stucks big!!!!!!!! actors were terrible in actting just real amatuers trying to make a horror/sociopath thriller it sucks! I want my money back!
1,A disappointment,"I love Parnell Hall's Stanley Hastings mysteries and was thrilled with the Steve Winslow books he wrote under the name J.P. Hailey. I thought I couldn't go wrong with one of his books, but I was wrong. The characters were not believable, more like caricatures, and the plot was rather predictable, missing the unique twists usually found in his books. The wit and humor usually signature in his books was a rather painful imitation here. I'll keep looking for new books in the other 2 series, but don't plan to come back for more of the Puzzle Lady."
2,Not enough clues for the Puzzle Lady,This is a weak mystery novel. There are only a few crossword puzzle clues that are a part of the story and they are not very difficult. If you are a huge crossword puzzle fan I would not recommend getting this book on that basis. As far as the other parts of the mystery there are very few clues. I found the reveling of the mystery to be extremely unsatisfying. The characters themselves and the dialogue of the novel are also sub-par. The Puzzle Lady has some life but little depth and the other characters are almost completely flat. There are definitely better mysteries out there.
2,"Nice features, poor implementation","Great features: The projection is a nice soft red, and has sufficient options to position it any way you may need. However, it's a very poor implementation. The projector is actually a separate clock, although you can't set it independently from the main clock. And, while the main clock is battery-backed, the projector clock isn't. So a brief power hiccup and the main clock stays set... but the projector clock resets to 12:00. So you have to take the batteries out, unplug it, and let it sit so BOTH clocks are at 12:00 and you can re-set them together. Problem is, half the time when you plug it in, it ""freezes,"" and you have to unplug it and try again or nothing works. It's disappointing."
4,Aero Bed 11011 Twin Size,"I can't say enough about the Aero Bed, I use it when company comes and when I go camping. The bed pumps up very fast and ready in minutes. It stores great and when you're ready for it, its ready to go to work and give who ever sleeps on it a great nights sleep."
2,Beware,"I have purchased two Solia flat irons in the past two years and both of them just stopped working. The first lasted for about 9 months and the other (which didn't come on this morning & that's why I'm online searching for another one) I think I've had for about 1 year. I didn't drop them or abuse them in any way and I was very happy with the straightening quality, but I'll not purchase another Solia again. However, I do wonder if that's just the nature of flat irons. I guess I'll find out after trying a different brand."
3,Works fine until it breaks,"I bought this and it worked great for about a year then some how the plates became loose and would not stay in...needless to say I had to buy another straightner. However, I have noticed that the typically life expectancy for a straightner is 1-3 years for an everyday user such as my self. So I feel that this straightner did its job."
4,No wonder it got to #1 in Spain,"This is a great album, generally cheesy pop but cheesy pop so energetic and exciting you can't help dancing and singing along, who cares what language it's in? My favourite is ""Deja Que Mueva Mueva Mueva"" but they're all great to dance to apart from the one ballad (yes! only one ballad!). Everytime I listen to it it reminds me of how great my holiday in Spain was. ""Yo Quiero Bailar"" (I want/love to dance) sums up this album perfectly, because when you listen to it all you'll want to do is dance dance dance!"
5,Good Value,"The lights are a good size and have a really nice finish, just what we were looking for. Good value for the price."
4,Recipe for Holiness,"I liked this book quite a bit. The short vignettes of the various saints, feast days and recipes are all just right. This is highly reccomended."
3,I tried to like it....,"I really did. The first time I glanced through Bad Catholic's I had some doubts but a number of people who I know to be devout said it was actually funny and light hearted so I bought the thing. After reading it I came to a conclusion: This book is amusing in a Napoleon Dynamite sort of way but it is NOT for people, (like me, I guess) who are dead serious and lack a sense a humor when it comes to Jesus, Mary and the saints. Plus that crack about Pope Leo wasn't cool at all. I returned the book the next day and got my money back."
3,Set of Wroght iron chairs,"Arrived quickly; not too complicated to assemble and all parts there. Not sure you could consider ALL the parts wrought iron. Seems that the back of the chair is, however the legs and brackets seem to be tubular metal. bottoms of legs could use some kind of plastic fitting for the ends. Would assist with an unlevel leg, and make the contact with flooring less irritating.Chair is comfortable to sit in as a kitchen dining chair, which was our purpose. And the price was very reasonable."
1,Don't waster your money,"The picture provided is not a true picture of the chairs. Firstly they are not brown, they are black and they are not a quality wrought iron which now looking back is the reason why they are so cheap. I would like to return them, but it is $34.83 to ship back plus the ATHOMEMART charge a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed with the whole situation and will never use this company again."
4,Fodor quality and presentation,"As an east coaster with interest in travel and exploration, this book provides a foundation for my exploration of the NW. Maps and suggestiojs are helpful."
3,Pretty,"This book serves as a good overview for someone unfamiliar with the Pacific Northwest. The book is pretty and has a nice layout, but I didn't feel like it had enough useful information that couldn't be found elsewhere. I got this before moving to Oregon, and while it did get me excited about my trip, I gathered more information doing research online."
1,Read fine print - CONTAINS PROP. 65 WARNING FOR HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN PRODUCTS,"Anybody interested in purchasing this product, or any other products from the ""Thomas & friends"" line, please read the fine print!!In the product details of this toy there is a link to a PROP. 65 WARNING. This means that this toy has been found to contain hazardous chemicals (often times lead) in amounts KNOWN TO BE HARMFUL!! This warning is required by the state of California which is why they must post it.I find it appalling that any toy for a child should demand a prop. 65 warning! Especially a brand as popular and loved as ""Thomas & friends"" which can probably be found in the home of any child!!! LEARNING CURVE SHOULD DO MORE TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE!!Please look for the prop. 65 warning when purchasing toys for your little one!!"
4,It's A HIT !,My 3 year old grandson absolutely loves it ! I am so glad I purchased it. It also goes well with the other tracks he has which allows him to make a huge track.
2,Not Very Spectacular,"I bought this book for my mother, a big fan of Elvis, and she was not impressed with the small photos, and the lack of any significant information. It is a good book for anyone who likes Elvis Presley and is curious about his movies. It is a good starter book for an Elvis Presley fan. However, it does not go very in-depth on any issue or any movie, and the photos in the book look like they were mostly publicity stills and other items that were relatively easy to get. Considering all of the movies and actors and actresses and directors that Elvis Presley worked with, a book about his movies should be pretty thick, and feature dozens of interviews with people that he worked with."
3,I like this CD....Me gusta la musica de David Civera..,"Si lo compares con David Bisbal, es mucho mejor que todos los artistas de Operacion Triunfo juntos. Me gustan sus canciones y sobre todo, este disco. I catch a lot of flack from my husband, who thinks all Spanish pop music is crap, but David Civera is a much better artist than those Operacion Triunfo alumni like David Bisbal. I love the title track and that's why I purchased it on Amazon. It's not flamenco style, however. If you want that, then you'll like David Bisbal or Alejandro Sanz or look for ""rumba"". But, if you like danceable pop en espanol, you will enjoy this CD."
4,Great Children's Book,As a former elementary school library tech I give this book a BIG 4 stars. Children (and adults) will delight in the humor of the illustrations!
3,Be aware of what you are and aren't getting here.,"I love Warne Marsh's playing; he was a truly different sound on tenor and all his recordings which I have heard are worthwhile, including this one. But there are two problems here which may bother potential buyers. First, this is a very brief sampling of Marsh! The CD comes in at under 31 minutes total,and generous solo space is allotted to pianist Ball and bassist Mitchell. My rough guess is that there's about 10-15 minutes of actual playing by WM himself on this CD. Second, the sound transfer from LP to CD has,for whatever reason,not been well done; there is very audible surface hissing/crackling. If you are an audiophile (I'm not) I suspect these technical flaws will be very annoying. Given these flaws, I'd call this a CD for Warne Marsh worshippers only. Four stars for his playing, two for the recording's brevity and so-so technical quality."
4,dynamic duo,"i have seen these films many, many times; but they always provide a couple of hours of great entertainment; one thing that is particularly interesting about the frank/gene duo in these films, is that frank plays an innocent guy fresh out of podunk, as compared to later movies when he is the smooth, ladies man......watching gene kelly dance is always worth the investment......."
5,Cool Special Powers,"Both the Snipers and the Vipers add cool special powers and new tactics to the game. The Vipers are fast (move 7, don't stop for water) but have a defense of 0. Their other power, the ""Frenzy"" is even better than the Vikings - they can move, attack, and roll for another turn. Nothings better than some frenzied vipers dicing up your friends Mimring in one turn.The Snipers are also fun with a neat ability. When they attack, every successful hit counts double. They only have 1 attack die though, so it's good to get them on high ground (+1 die) and then start shooting. They're also helped a lot if you can get them near some of the Heroes of Bleakwood who can add another die."
2,very cheap band,"Own the watch for a couple of weeks when the band broke, nice looking watch but plan on buying a band for it"
5,SUNDAY HOUSEWIFE,"For those like me that spend every sunday beside your man watching the race this is the book that should be on the coffee table. I found so much information and facts in this book. I didn't have to ask so many questions as to why they do this or why they do that. This is a very fact filled, informative book on many legends of Nascar. A really great buy that will have all Nascar fans wanting more."
3,Wished they had let me know color,"It wasn't indicated what color case would arrive. I had wrongly assumed it would be black, so wasn't completely thrilled when the item was brown."
5,Palm Z22 case,This case makes it easier for me to locate my Palm Z22 and gives it a convient place to store it when I'm not using it.
1,Get ready to rust...,"These knives may look pretty out of the box but after one wash, every single piece had some sort of rust spot! They also don't keep an edge very well -- I would suggest saving your money until you can afford a quality set of knives, you would be truly throwing it away by picking up this inferior product!"
1,Don't waste a cent...,"I'm a huge royal watcher, big royal collector so when I heard there was a fanfiction book I jumped right on it. Let me say it was the biggest piece of garbage I've ever read. Poorly written, rushed, no depth, unrealistic to say the least. Both Emily and William are ridiculous and very unlikeable, shallow and boring. Any kind of real depth that could be interesting with fanfiction, such as exploring the fun feelings of dating a prince, actually falling in love come to statements like '...and they dated for a few months until Christmas when they realized they loved each other.' Wow, that skipped alot, I could read a Daily Mail article and get the same unattached, no detail courtship about Kate and William. Trash, really, honestly, don't waste your money it's rubbish."
1,"You have two of my reviews--please delete one, thanks",Please notice that the review with my name has an almost identical review after it. That is because it was my first and I got bumped offline before I finished and didn't know it would go through. Now I know. Thanks.
2,"based on meaningless sex, no love involved","this is my first susan johnson book and i was utterly disappointed. it begins with interest, but ends without much play of emotions. if you like your romances raunchy, this wouldn't even meet par. the sex is unimaginative and dull, the characters completely without feeling. it's hard to tell whether dermott and isabella are in love or are just in lust. i wasn't able to feel any kind of devoted passion between the two. a complete waste of time."
1,Dreadful!,"I've read some bad stories in my time and this one rates as one of the worse. The love-making is as sexy as a bucket of cold sick. Neither of the main characters are very pleasant. Dermott is a ho. There is nothing worse than reading about a hero who sleeps with other women despite supposedly involved with the heroine. And as for Isabella, her behaviour as a virgin beggars belief. I would avoid this book at all costs."
1,poor,i have all of susan's books and this has got to be her worst. i was most dissappointed after waiting most earnestly for the release of this book. The book bears no resemblance to former ones. I found no connection between the characters as well as the story left me unmoved. It took me three days to complete unlike others which i couldn't wait to finish.
5,Buenismo!,"If you went to Spain this summer you need to own a copy of El Verano Ya Llego. It brings back all of my memories from my time at the beaches and discotecas in Valencia and Barcelona. By far the bests songs on the CD are: ""El verano ya llego"" (Megalo), ""Yo Quiero Bailar"" (Sonia y Selena, ""Decile que lo Quiero"" y ""En la Casa de Ines""....ah memories, such fond memories....la Fiesta de San Juan, El Bario Carmen....Denia...Ruzafa...I miss it. I'm going to go listen to my cd now...."
3,Just okay for me.,"The book is small, the pics are small and the magnets are small. I will keep it but if I saw it in a store first I would not have bought it. My 1 1/2yr old daughter seems to like it. The pieces are small enough for her hands and she puts them on the pages in the book. They do stick well."
2,Returned for larger Pot,I returned Circulon Classic 10-Quart Covered Stockpot for a Circulon Classic 12-Quart Covered Stockpot
1,save your money,I try and get scripture based movies but this one preys on people like me. The plot is slow to develop and the acting is poor as well as sound and lighting. Save your money
2,Order of Battle Allied Ground Forces Operation Desert Storm,"If you a war gamer this work will do just fine. However, if youare a professional soldier or military scholar you will find abig topic of information missing. Military order of battle contains detailed information on unit commanders and key (general officer) staff. Dinackus should have provided at least the names - rank - branch of commanders down to battalion andsimilar data on all Generals. The one time he looks at General Schwarzkopf in the form of a bio sketch it is very light. All in all this is not a work that should have gotten by the editor."
4,a fun read,"i really love this series. the only issue i have, is with the narrator. i like her voice, but she consistantly mispronounces A LOT of words. its really annoying and i wish that someone would correct her, especially when the mispronunciation carries from book to book."
4,A Great Book For Planning A Vacation,"This is a book that I have liked in the past, and when I saw the 1999 edition was out with a new section on Animal Kingdom, I just had to get it. It dicusses every ride and gives them final ratings (but the section that said something like""Save for last"" somehow dissapeared). Younger kids and adults will enjoy this book that will definetly help with the planning of a vacation. You shouldn't hesitate to but this for anyone, especially if they are going to enjoy Walt Disney World for the first time."
4,This book is a nice little surprise!,"Surprisingly this is a very fun story. I was hesitant to buy this as it is the only story by Frank Darabont, and he's a film director not a writer, but I was glad I did. This was a fun dark comedy story of horror. It's about a writer who makes a deal with a local typewriter salesman to repair his typewriter. What he didn't know was this guy was going to put a demon in his typewriter to help him write. Obviously this doesn't go well. The author gets better, but at a price. This was easy to read, kept the reader entertained with humor throughout and was just a fun little scary story. Plus there are some good illustrations by Bernie Wrightson within the book. I liked this book a lot: recommended!"
1,Bang for buck? Not so much!,"I LOVE Michael Buble, and his song ""Home"" blows me away. HOWEVER, when I purchased this CD, I was under the impression that it would be a whole album for the price of 9.99. Boy was I wrong. I got the package and downloaded all of ONE SONG onto my computer. A disappointment and a major waste of money. Don't buy this cd. Find another way to buy the ONE SONG, ""Home""."
1,Don't [Buy] This Book!,Do not waste your money on this book. It's not even a book;it's a pamplet; about 20 pages. The author simply espouses thestandard legends and theories. It's a lot like an encyclopedia entry.No research involved; no interesting new theories.
4,TIM IS TOPS...,"This is a gem of a film, starring the underrated Piper Laurie in the role of a well to do, but lonely, business woman, Mary Horton, who befriends a very nice, good looking day laborer, Tim Melville, earnestly played by a very young Mel Gibson. Tim happens to be a little simple. His family describes him as being ""a few short of a full quid"".While he does work around her house, she gets to know him, as well as his working class family. As time goes on, a deep fondness that ripens into love develops between the two. He brings her out of her shell, and she teaches him to read and explains concepts that will enable him to function better in the world around him. Based upon Collen McCollough's book of the same name, this is a very well acted film, with fine performances by the supporting cast, as well as the leads."
5,El Rencuentro is going to make history again!,I absolutely love the music of El Reencuentro! Ray Reyes' idea of getting these guys together again is superb! I would like to see them come out with an english CD for their American fans like me!
2,not all that impressive...,"there's little variety on this disc. the female vocals are okay, but it's a too-catchy commercial melody. And the mixes are mostly disco/house funk, with only two harder, more tribal mixes, the Steve Lawler mix and the Antoine Clamaran mix. But even then, the more aggressive, dark mix doesn't really suit the happy go lucky vocal. Not only was Lola's theme a better song, but it also had a more versatile selection of mixes. However, I guess if you're a fan of that way-too happy house, you'll love this."
3,two moods,"Two lp's on one cd. The first part has six tracks, the second five tracks. I think the first part is the best. You will hear Bob Gordon on his warm sounding baritone and Herbie Harper on trombone in good solo and ensemble work. The second part is not bad, but you have to hear the sound of Bob Enevolsen's tenor to appreciate this part (#9.10.11) To my opinion does he sound a bit shrill, small voiced. The blues track 10 lasts too long (8:32). You will also hear Marty Paich on accordeon on track 8 and 9. The recording quality is pretty good."
5,I could not stop watching!,"I purchased this 2-DVD set directly from Classical Pilates and I am thrilled that it is now available to everyone through Amazon. It is truly a magnificent collection produced with the high standards I have come to expect from this company. I could not stop watching it the day it arrived! Some of the exercises, especially on the Cadillac, are certainly of the Cirque du Soleil caliber and so breathtaking to watch, but most exercises are for the beginner through intermediate and advanced, and there are modifications presented for several, like Swan on the Barrel. It is an inspiration to see how far you can take the Pilates method and still keep it pure! Completed by a discussion with Bob Liekens and Alycea Ungaro covering such topics as ""Which came first - the Mat or the Equipment,"" this set is not only a guide, but a tribute to the method as well. Great work!"
2,disappointing considering the publisher,"I bought a copy of this book because I enjoy reading the magazine so much. I find that it seemed to be geared (sorry) to road bikes, with mt. bike comments on the side. There weren't enough photos or diagrams giving directions for me, though it is somewhat helpful. I'm disappointed though."
5,Prophetic and poignant mirror of our own hearts....Superb!,"After reading this comic, I was pleasently shocked at the balance and purity the writer reflected from his own heart, and the hearts of us all. This is an underground book that is well past due to hit the gut of mainstream comics. It is rare that an artist comes along who portrays the hopes, dreams and fears of us all, in superb comic form... The pure insouciance of the author is written in every line, and drawn in every line...I read this, and have no hesitation comparing the artist to Claremont, Miller, Vasquez, Mack, and Bendis. Purchase this book and see your own reflection carefully and craftfully reflected within these lines and words. A MUST READ. A MUST HAVE. A MUST STANDARD."
3,they should've hired a graphic designer!,Nothing to complain about as far as the contents; it's an interesting hodge-podge of articles by or about Tesla. What I didn't like about the book was the bizzare typesetting and the poor reproduction quality of the photos. The photos are noticeably pixelated and low resolution; it almost looks like the photos were badly scanned jpegs taken off a website! Over half the book is set in ALL CAPS using a monotype font. Weird.
1,Why Bother....Couldn't Agree More!,"Craig is exactly right. I was pretty excited to see an American version of my favorite British show but was very, very disappointed. In defense of the American attempt: british boys Jeremy, Richard and James have a chemistry you just can't duplicate with a formula, and it's that chemistry that has made Top Gear UK a global success."
2,So Stupid,Who are these guys and why should I care what they have to say? I have only watched a couple of these episodes and I just don't care. They are trying to replicate Top Gear UK but can't even come close.
4,Great show,"If you are in to cars, this is a great show. The second season is especially great so far. The guys mesh much better this time around. The last episode with the lexus lfa was great. I can't wait to see the next one."
3,It leaks,"I use this adaptor with my Katadyn Combi Water Microfilter which is an excellent product. For some reason, the rubber seal comes with the adaptor does not quite fit. As a result, it leaks and I need to use a container to receive the leaking water."
2,Not for the true horror fan,"This is a horror/thriller about a killer running amok during a movie marathon. The idea behind the movie is sort of cool and ahead of its time, being that is was released in theaters in 1989. I think that is the only real positive thing I can say about this film. As far as acting goes, the movie stars Jill Schoelen and Tom Villard as the main charecters, and the acting is terrible and unconvincing. Also, the movie is not scary at all, in fact they try to make it funny by adding jokes. This is definitly not for the hard core horror fan, but maybe fans of the Scream and Urban Legend type of horror movies might find something special in this movie. As for quality, it made a good transition to DVD, although a bit grainy in some scenes. The sound is also decent throughout most of the movie. One thing it could have used is more extras added to the DVD."
1,0.25 STARS: Buy this movie and you deserve to go home in a box.,"Well, I just don't ever learn. I cannot believe I bought this crap. Why do I keep buying these movies? I am looking for a diamond in the rough and I found a piece of crap in ""Popcorn"". Popcorn is about as stupid and as over the top as its name. This movie is ridiculous and while it is definitely different, you cannot possibly take this movie seriously as a horror movie. The killer is a dork and the movie just flat out sucks...most of the movie takes place in a movie theatre and the plot is ridiculous. If you are interested in some silly little movie that gives horror movies a bad name, this garbage is for you. However, if you are interested in a serious horror movie, don't buy or rent a movie by the name of ""Popcorn"" or you will sorely regret it. Personally, I'd rather eat a bag of burnt popcorn than watch this trash again."
4,$340.00?!,Granted this movie was an Awsome one But $340.00!!!! I would have to sooooo waisted not to see that price to pay that! Maybe $34.00 Because it's a Classic. I see in the other comments that the transfer to DVD was not so good but on a smaller screen could'nt be too bad for me. I'll be looking for a cheeper price in new condition elseware.
4,Leaderdogs for the Blind - Lemonade,"""Lemonade"" (1995) is the only full-length release from industrial hard rock/metal band Leaderdogs for the Blind. This album includes nine songs and a minute-and-a-half reading from C.S. Lewis's ""The Great Divorce"".This album is heavily guitar-driven. The musicianship here isn't going to blow anyone away, but it's thoroughly competent. Most of the songs are fairly simple and feature passionate, catchy choruses. The band shows a good, restrained use of samples - they're used in moderation, and are always relevant to the song. The lyrics here are distinctly above average. Leaderdogs was a Christian band, which comes through tastefully and without bludgeoning the listener.""Lemonade"" is greater than the sum of its parts, and is a completely enjoyable industrial hard rock/metal album. Leaderdogs should have been heard from further."
2,Moral Realism: yikes.,"If there's one thing I learned from studying literature, it's that ethics are comprised by social context; and the context in a novel is largely CONTRIVED by its author. In an age of postmodern criticism then, it is shocking to find this sort of flat, naive, victorian interpretation. Moral realism. Yikes."
2,"comfy, that's all","While this bra is reasonably comfortable, calling it a minimizer is a total misnomer. Why a company designs a minimizing bra with stretchy cups stumps me. As a DDD, I want the girls held high and tight. This bra may be fine for smaller figures, but if you need major lift, look elsewhere. So far Wacoal is the best I've found. Yes, you're going to pay at least twice as much, but this is an article of clothing that you wear every day. I do wear this Lilyette bra on the weekends when both my breasts and I can just hang around."
5,"Ah, minimizer bra in my style!",Great comfort for me. Pretty soon the style will be discontinued. So try to get many as you can for your comfort.
1,"Please, someone start the eulogy","It's a doggone shame, but it's time that Det. Carol Ashton takes a bullet. Thus, the character, the series and the readers will be put out of their collective misery. Perhaps it's time to bring Sybil back into the series full time instead of just the occasional mention. Or, make the series about Aunt Sarah...she, at least, is interesting. Det. Ashton has lost her passion, seemingly, for everything. Her cases, her friendships, herlovers(?), and her overall interactions with everyone around her are as stale as week old bread. It's a doggone shame."
1,bad plug,this would not work for my bike..even though it had said it would work with that particular motor.would fire out properly.......bad plug
2,NOT A REAL GOOD IMAGE,"A FRIEND INSISTED I TAKE A LISTEN. THE COVER TURNED ME OFF, BUT I GAVE IT A SHOT. I'M YOUNG -19- BUT VERY CONSERVATIVE AND CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I INTERPRET TO BE UNoffensive TO THE LORD. IF YOU DON'T MIND TINKERING ON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD IN YOUR CHRISTIAN WALK YOU'LL LIKE THIS GROUP OKAY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY OUT OF THE GREY AREAS OF CHRISTIANITY THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. AS A YOUTH PASTOR SAID TO ME WHICH I LIVE BY ""when in doubt-----DON'T!!!"""
5,A necessity for running two transducers on one sonar unit.,"This switch is a necessity for anyone wanting to run 2 transducers on one sonar unit. This will work for older sonar units, with the aid of adapter cables."
4,Interesting Tracks & Great Singing,"If you get past the usual ""It Must Be Him"" and a few of the others, this is an interesting CD containing several tracks unavailable elsewhere.Most odd is the inclusion of ""For All We Know"" billed as the ""Coots/Lewis"" song beloved of all so-called ""lounge"" singers,-in fact it's the seventies song popularised by Bassey/Carpenters et al from Miss Carr's 1971 ""Vikki Carr's Love Story"". Even stranger that album was for Columbia and this is an EMI (who now own Liberty Records who Ms.C.recorded for until 1970) release. Hope I haven't started a copywrite dispute between EMI & Sony, but this is an excellent broad based collection of English language recordings from the great lady."
1,Get a life,"People are people. Are you the same on your job as you are at home? Are you the same at home as you are in your head? I hate books that try to shove people into little categories. Rosie gives to charities and loves children and if that were all she was, it would be enough. People who have to find the negative in celebrities are probably very negative people themselves. By the way, the cover is a very poorly digitally altered picture to make her look fatter. Nice touch, Jim, Susan and Nicholas. I'd like to see pictures of you that you didn't have control over the publication of."
4,What a Nice Surprise,"Inconsequential? No, no, no...this is a hot little surprise of a live CD. This reflects the great experience you get by hearing Little Feat live today. The playing swings, the singing is hot, and while yes, there are songs done elsewhere (better? maybe, maybe not)every time this band tackles a favorite, it's almost a new song. You're here at this page because you like Feat, but if you don't know them well, here's a great way to get acquainted...and at such a weirdly low price. I was so surprised to find this and while not an ""official"" Feat thing, it can take it's place in their library of great recordings. Get this while you can"
2,Business of Being Born,"Very Informative about giving birth at home. However, without a fetal monitor to watch the oxygen level of the fetus, you are putting your unborn child into great jeopordy and/or permanent mental and physical impairment or death. Your needs and desires should not be above the child."
2,Closed Captioning does not work!,"I am profoundly deaf and I bought The Business of Being Born DVD which is supposed to have Closed Captioning as stated on the DVD box. It does not have the subtitles features. When I tried to play it on 3 different televisions, it would not work! I am very disappointed for I am not able to watch it without understanding! I don't know why the Closed Captioning doesn't work? Maybe because it was used and it malfunctioned? I only watched 15 minutes and could not understand anything so I have this DVD which I am not able to watch! (frown)"
3,Item arrived fine but...,"This DVD arrived completely fine and in a timely manner, however, I was disappointed in how one-sided it was. I was expecting to watch a video comparing hospital vs. at home births and this was not a comparison! Geared only towards at home births...which I was not all about. A friend suggested it to me and I have since told her that it was a little crazy for me to even consider!!!!! Not much ""education/information"" in this video...basically just follows around a few women who give birth at home. Nothing wrong with the seller but I wish I didn't order this:("
3,"Good subject, not enough facts.","While this movie presented an interesting perspective on the birth process (one which I ultimately agree with, actually), it lacked concrete facts and data to back up what some of the experts in the movie were saying. For example, ""we have more infants die in the US each year during childbirth than in the Netherlands."" While that is probably true, an actual statistic would give it more credibility. Of course we have MORE, we have MORE PEOPLE...is it a higher death RATE or is it simply MORE? This happens with several different experts on the subject throughout the movie.Overall it is worth the $4 to watch, though."
4,"Biased, but interesting and informative.","Interesting and informative although definitely based on biased opinions. I feel like they didn't fairly portray some of the statistics they reported, but overall it was good."
1,Not what you think! Waste of time and $$$,"Just awful! I bought this DVD thinkging that it was a documentary about birth and looked forward to watching it with my husband. Turns out, its actually a documentatary about the actual business of birth, meaning the health care system and how woman all use hospitals instead of popping a squat in their living rooms and giving birth there. All it is, is advocating & lobbying for woman to give birth @ home with midwives."
3,4 2 GO,"the grandkids and I fill the orange lidded bowl with meat/chicken and marinade, fill the red lidded bowl 1/2 with ice, place the meat bowl inside the icefilled bowl, and voila the meat stays fresh for our bbq. Other bowls filled with veggies and hummus and we're on our way to Juanita Park Beach."
4,Mixing bowl set,Pyrex Smart Essentials 8 piece Mixing Bowl Set - got this for my son and his girlfriend - came in excellent shape and in good time. They were well pleased with them - have lids that go along with them and are in 4 different sizes that were just right for them. Recommend highly!
5,High quality item,"Exactly what I wanted, great packaging and easy storage. Pyrex is a name to trust, which I why I purchased this item over other similar ones."
5,The Divine Drama,Excellent book by Kurt Bruner. The Divine Drama gives a new and much-needed perspective on the Biblical story that emphasizes the importance of the story and our place in it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is feeling that their beliefs have become stale or uninspiring. Brought tears to my eyes and injected new life into my faith and beliefs.
3,Hot Scenes,"Ok, so the acting's not so hot- but the actresses are. I like the kitchen scene. Stereotypical- perhaps. But you can't say it doesn't happen. Or that you don't want it to happen (to someone else while you watch!)."
2,Warning: Paul Orfalea Chapter,"This text has many good elements. However, there is a hagiographic chapter on Paul Orfalea which may turn your stomach. Orfalea founded Kinko's, which is famous mostly for having more labor complaints than probably any other firm in the past decade. The text does not mention Kinko's poor record on labor. If you use this as a text, I suggest supplementing it with some clippings of the NLRB filings by Kinko's employees to allow your students to come to their own conclusions. Did Orfalea build a valuable business, or did he build a personal empire on the backs of minimum wage slaves?"
3,Don't really know how it works yet.,"I certainly haven't opened it because this is for emergency prep....and that emergency hasn't happened yet. However, it looks just like the picture."
2,Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords,"I was looking for a game that would be fun to play on the wii. I'm sure this is fine on a regular computer but there's too much point and click for the wii. Even my kids got bored! I was disappointed with the graphics, it's very still and the only animation is a moving map. Overall, a bit clunky."
3,Fahrenheit has changed,"I used to love this a few years back.Something has changed.It is now a lot more ""used oil"" smelling and less of the bright and peaceful type of smells that are good about it.I fear for the people around me when I wear it, so I really have to go easy on it.Shipping was quick through Prime.Price is okay.Packaging was substandard."
1,Best used in private,"This perfume has a very strong smell that's described as refreshing, woody and mossy, the smell is unique but somewhat reminiscent of a mix of puke and sweat, perhaps is why many describe it as masculine.No matter what you think of it, this (as any exceptionally strong perfume) is absolute hell for anyone with a sharper sense of smell. So unless you are surrounded with people with a dulled sniffer, be considerate and don't use it in excess. Definitely not good for business situations (that call for a bit of subtlety) as it can backfire, quite badly."
1,Not a fan!,It really depends on your taste but I am not a fan. Unfortunetely I bought this for my husband and spent way too much money on it. It has a kind of spicy smell that makes me ill. I won't even let him wear it. Have spent a lot less on much better scents.
4,"Good mystery and suspense, but...","I give this book 4 stars because it was a good mystery with suspense. However, it doesn't pass for 5 stars because, although the romance was almost non-existent and I like more romance, what confused me was why Kim would apologize to Winn, when she was the injured party 10 years ago and present day. She was being harassed and violated, but nothing legally was done about it. No one apologized to her. Worse than that, Zell was supposed to love her, but kept quiet about the crimes against her even though he knew it was his family committing them. He lied on the stand about her which led to her having to leave her home in the first place! He never apologized or seemed to feel remorse for it. Talk about betrayal. The fact that actual crimes were committed was glossed over. I just didn't understand that. Otherwise, I liked the book. Try Now I see You instead - a much better and tightly woven story."
1,Piece of Junk,"And even worse, it waste your money and time to figure out problems with no clue. It drive you cray...the worst purchase of my life.Throw in Trash and I am happy.Overall problem:(1) Drinks ink(2) Poor design with confusing error message/instructions. To name a few:False paper jam error kept popping up and you can't clear it up. I have to un-plug and power strip.Worst usability of ""rich"" functions which has been hidden so deep inside complicated menus, I can't remember even some comoon simple fax tasks...you need manual from time to time.The ink cleaning, canceling job, such simple task may take minutes to finish and you have no idea what is going on.(3) Poor manufacturer -- scanner died in two month and the repair shop said they saw a bunch of this returns...difficult to match it with brother nameBTW, that is my first purchase of Brother and I promise, it is the last one. I would go for HP, Canon..."
5,"High Strangeness, in the tradition of Jacques Vallee and Charles Fort","This encyclopedic treatment of the subject of crop circles is the only one you will need on your bookshelf. Starting with a history of the phenomenon that sets the framework for the discussion to come, Silva presents an overview of the hoaxsters and their work, as well as the cases that defy explanation. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the author has taken the time to examine the physical evidence itself, such as electro-magnetic effects, the possible role of light, the meaning of the changes in soil samples, and the plants themselves. Silva is not a follower of the ET Hypothesis; rather he advocates an explanation that entails the ability of advanced races to travel in time and other dimensions at will. I do not pretend to understand his mathmatics, but that is of little importance. He examines the entire range of the phenomenon, and all readers interested in unexplained happenings will be intrigued and enlightened."
5,Very Good Book,"I found Silva's book very thorough in its detailing of the crop circle phenomenon, particularly in regards to clearing up the discrepancies between real crop circles vs. hoaxes. I like how he mingles thorough research with personal observations and experimentation. I also really enjoyed the chapters about the connections to sound, light, and ancient cultures and spiritual traditions. As someone who is not very scientifically inclined, I found Silva's language to be accessible, as I found myself wishing I had paid more attention to my geometry and physics classes when I was in school. I'm always fascinated by serious discussion of the mysteries of our universe, and this book certainly did not disappoint in that regard."
3,"Not Voodoo, Hoodoo.","The is an okay book, however it's not about Voodoo. It's more like Hoodoo practice which is different from Vodou. The veves for the loas is all wrong. The book gives a ritual when healing a voodoo victim by drawing a checkerboard like veve and have the patient lying on it. There's no such thing like checkerboard veve in voodoo. I would like for the author to tell me for what loa the checkerboard is for. But it's an okay read. excuse the grammar, got to go>"
2,rat pack,"Very dated, unfortunately. I would not recommend it to anyone 40 years old or younger, probably it would be just too corny. I am in my 70's so I enjoyed seeing those familiar faces and simplistic plots.Linda Sheean"
1,Amazon don't ship good.,"Ordered this directly from Amazon. Shipped in a bubble mailer. All of the corners are bent. Even the items inside the box sleeve and the book. Indents and scratches on cover. Used? Re-seal? Maybe. It kind of looks like it and there is a mark on one of the discs and scuffs on the inside plastic area holding the discs. Thanks amazon. Ruined a new? $50 Criterion Collection set and waisted my money, or shipped it in the mailer to make a used set look like a new one roughed up in the mail."
1,I wish I hadn't bought this one,"I bought this and I wish I hadn't. I agree with the previous reviewer, the picture quality is extremely poor and sound quality is even poorer. I can only hear 1 or 2 words out of a whole conversation. This is not like any of the Shirley Temple shows that I've seen on TV. This DVD consists of several short films/skits, and they are all terrible. The kids don't act like kids, and none of the skits were funny at all. I ordered the Little Rascal Vol 1&2 at the same time and just love that one. The kids in Little Rascal act like kids and are hilarious."
2,"Again, Surrender Cinema surrenders to censorship!","Dont buy this DVD! Surrender Cinema has a unfortunate knack of claiming ""Director's Cut"" on it's DVDs when in fact they are no such thing. This film is rather heavily censored. All the other reviews of this are apparently from pople who don't realize this sad fact. Sorry you wasted your money because many scenes/takes have been cut out of the US version, despite the fact it claims ""Directors Cut"". Be weary... you're being had my friends. Sad thing is, I rate the ""real"" director's cut version 5 stars all the way!"
2,All censored,"I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version."
5,Indispensible Readings on the Psychology of Concepts,"For linguistics and the philosophy of language to make any headway, the psychological nature of concepts cannot be ignored.In ""Core Readings,"" Margolis and Laurence performed the admirable job of keeping us on this task by assembling writings and criticisms of five theories of concepts: Classical, Prototype, Theory-Theory, Neoclassical, and Conceptual Atomism. What emerges from this assembly is an identification of the core questions that any theory of concepts must address.No serious student of concepts should neglect this important collection."
3,Another Gabrielino speaks,"The Gabrielino's are not extinct. We are alive and living all over Southern California and Arizona. Bruce Miller's book was informative and incorrect. Many families still live around the Mission San Gabriel where a lot of my family is buried. The reservation was out in the desert, unwanted habitat, as most res' were. Southern California has become a wasteland for the greedy whiteman. It was once lush and abundant with natural beauty. The air is putrid and the land drained. It could be rich again."
5,My cat LOVES this toy!,"Great toy... very durable... she loves this toy! Even with being thrown here and there, getting chewed on, and scratched, our cat absolutely loves this toy!"
1,False Advertising,"The manual states : ""please note that your new charger CANNOT be used to charge alkaline, rechargeable alkaline, rechargeable nickel cadmium(NiCd), carbon zinc, or lithium batteries."""
5,100 Year old lie is 100% truth!,"We are facing so many health hazards that we must be informed or we will parish. In 100 Year Old Lie, we learn about the effect that dangerous chemicals have on our lives. This book needs to be in every library!Also about the chemicals we are forced by the medical profession to take in the form of vaccination are these three top books:The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts about VaccinationVaccination Horror: An anthology of important works on vaccination pseudoscienceThe Vaccination Myth: Courageous MD exposes the Vaccination Fraud!100 Year old lie is 10 out of 10!"
1,Deserves zero stars,"This is just about the worst book I have ever read. Fitzgerald commits the ultimate crime in his use of junk-science malarchy and apples-to-oranges comparisons. Perhaps, when he acquires SOME form of reputable science degree, he could actually say a few words with some authority. Until a sound basis can be made for the mechanisms and exposures that Fitzgerald puts forth, file this book under ""fiction"". I am not saying that toxic chemicals do not exist. I am a Medical Toxicologist, board-certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties. It's my job to study the toxic nature of chemicals and the patients who are exposed to them. But I do so in a reasonable, rational scientific fashion. As such, it just kills me that a joker like this can get away with writing such a book."
1,Man- what a groove.,"In the mid to late fifties, so many bands made ordinary, acoustic music. Very mild by our modern standards. These cats wail with a sound that was only emulated 20 years after the songs on this album. Listen to the samples, I am sure you will be surprised with the modern sound these guys lay down."
3,"Yes, Again!","Mayle makes his third journey to Provence and the idea is wearing a little thin.Still a page turner but definitely lacks the ""joie de vivre"" of the first two books. Too much Mayle and not enough people of Provence."
2,A pale comparison to its predecessors,"I enjoyed Mr. Mayle's previous books on Provence. He has a wonderfully witty sense of humor, and his portrayal of human foibles is accurate and at the same time warm-hearted. However, not much of these qualities appeared in this book. He has flashes of the brilliance that appeared in the previous books, but those flashes are few and far between. Instead we get a lot of rambling thoughts and story-telling based on speculation rather than actual incidents, resulting in a watered-down version of the previous books. It appears to me that Mr. Mayle is counting his previous successes to carry him through this one. It may work this time, but I'll be a little more cautions before I jump at the next book he puts out."
2,Hardly his best,"This seems one of those sequel books that an author sort of throws together to make a buck. I wouldn't call it awful, I mean he is a good writer and the subject matter is still special, but his best work it ain't."
1,so bad I returned it after 3 chapters,"Skip this one. I am very, very disappointed. Mr. Mayle...next book please take your time"
4,Reach for more,This worked really well. It was easy to solder wire on. The next one I buy I want something that does not need to be bolted in place.
3,"Just okay for rural areas, but much better than nothing","When traveling through rural Tuscany, the maps would occasionally direct us to take roads through farmers fields or boulder strewn mountain roads, or through locked gates on private roads. On other occasions, the road on the map would disappear, and the Tomtom would tell us to turn around. In either case, ignoring it for a few miles would set it straight. There were times when it would tell us there is no route to our destination. Despite the flaws, we would have been really lost without it."
3,A little difficult and not much to hold your interest,"I remember having an ants in the pants toy when I was young so when I saw this SpongeBob version I thought my 4 year old would love it since she loves everything Spongebob.It was way to difficult for her to be able to get the ants to fly. But even my 6, 7 and 9 year old had trouble with it. They are usually very easy to please and enjoy most games and toys. But they found this to be a little difficult and just not enough to keep them interested for more than about 3 or 4 minutes. Now these kids are not the type that get bored easily or are hard to please but this one didn't do it for them at all."
5,Brilliant Catholic movie for children and adults,"Everyone will enjoy this movie, from a 3 year old to adults. From an era when truly good movies won the Cannes Film Festival comes a story of an orphan boy adopted by a group of loving and generous Franciscan Friars who want to teach the child virtues, but the virtues are only taught to him by Christ himself, and the life of the friars is transformed. This movie emphasizes generosity and the love that only Christ can bring us. Once you see it, you will never forget the imagery, the power of every scene and every word that is said."
2,Umpteenth Generation Bootleg,Stay away from this one and buy the Basie release in the Jazz Icons series. A difference of night and day.
4,Fun and lighthearted--perfect summer read,"I was looking for something a little less dense than the heavy nonfiction I've been reading as of late...I wanted to take a novel with me on vacation, and the flap copy on this one made it sound perfect. Sure enough, it was. Landvik's tale is a heartwarming one, and well-written enough to keep me turning the pages while on the beach, before going to sleep, while sipping my tea in the morning, etc. The cast of characters is engaging and their development is thorough; the laughs are plentiful; and the twists and turns of small-town life (and life in general!) are portrayed realistically. This novel made me want to pick up her other books and devour those as well. I'm even considering moving to Minnesota after this one...I'm pining for someplace like Tall Pines."
1,Archaic Imperial Units,"This would be an excellent introduction to applied mechanics, except that the entire book is done in obsolete imperial units. Buy something else."
4,A Dark Story,"This was an interesting book, but not a very pleasurable read. I guess it depends on what types of stories you like to read. The story, plot were exciting; however after reading the book, I came away wondering about the author's views on women. EJD is a very talented writer. He tells the story from a first person point of view; however women are not portrayed in a positive light. The women seem to be oversexed and immature, with no rooting or grounding. The characters are very insecure and mixed up. Although I would have preferred to see women in the story portrayed in a more positive light, I must say that EJD has done a wonderful job of telling a story."
2,Disappointed,"I am a fan of EJD, have read and enjoyed all his books.But this one was disappointing. The story was perdictable and choppy,the characters colorless. This has fallen short of his usual brillance .Ending this book I was left not wanting more.I will stay a fan and await his next novel."
5,Absolutely off da chains,"Without going in details of what the book is about:I read this book in 2-3 days. It was the B-O-M-B!!!!I love EJD and all the novels written by him.A book written in 1st person, that of a woman, made me stand in her shoes. I felt what she felt.(well he didn't give her a name, but her friend, Yvette, called her ""Freckles"", so we'll work with that). I wanted to claw Charles and Jessica. I hated that David did what he did, but I guess that's what happens in these type situation. The only and I mean only part of the book I wasn't happy with was the ending....after all they went through, I just knew that it would be a happy ending...my heart was shattered just as Charles' lung when he was shot.On da real, this book is a MUST-HAVE!! get it today"
5,All I can say is WOW,"EJD latest book is AWESOME. Once you start you can not put it down until you are finished. His development of the characters will draw you in and keep you turning the pages. I would love to see another story with Freckle's friend Yvette.EJD keep doing what you are doing and I can't wait until your next book ""Naughty or Nice"" comes out.Peace"
5,EXCELLENT READ!,"This book is a page turner, an all-nighter...you'll not want to put it down and when the ride is over you'll just want to get in line and start again!"
4,Unbeleivable!,"When I first read this book I didn't think I would finish it because it moved too slow, but as I continued to read it picked up. Oh boy did it pick up! As I read it was like I was in the middle of the room watching these people lives take place. I although I predicted it I still coulnd't believe what happened towards the end. I had nightmares about this book the night I finished it. Freckles was caught in the middle/involved of all the madness. My heart hurt for Charles even though he made a stupid mistake. My heart ached painfully David Lawrence the most. He loved his wife so much...The whole tragedy was her fault any way.Great book EJD.You really depressed me with this one. Don't think I'll be able to read another book for months ;)"
4,Great Book,"Like all of EJD's books, this one was just as great as the others. Plenty of action and drama. If you're a big EJD fan, you won't be disappointed with this book. And if you aren't a fan or have never read any of his books, you'll definitely become a faithful EJD follower after reading this book. The only thing I didn't like about it was that he doesn't give the narrator a name (he did the same thing to the narrator in Between Lovers, too.) I HATE that! I like to know the names of the people I'm reading about!"
3,Not as good as I thought,"This book was not as good as I thought it could be. It took me 3 weeks for me to finish, when good books take me a few days, at the most a week. The only reason I finished it was because I just need to see the ending. It was very slow, the best part of the book was the last 10 pages. It dragged it didn't really have a point.The best book Eric wrote was Cheaters. His newest books are not as good, they are in a way pointless. There were a few good moments, but nothing to make you cringe for more. You are better off borrowing this book."
1,"large, deep rust proof metal pan and handle",This poop picker upper pan is all aluminum so it won't rust. I leave mine outside near the dogpen year round for easy access. The pan is the largest I've found and it can hold a few days' worth of my boxer's messes. The front edge lays flat and even to get right under piles. Two improvements could be a higher panel on the back side and an ergonomic wrist supportive handle. Due to the size of the pan when its full it can be heavy and a strain on your wrist.
2,Slingback Pump,Not very comfortable...the zig-zag edge is sharp on my foot...the color isn't what I was looking for.
3,Fast read.,Great book for rainy day reading. Story is interesting. Stumbled on writing style and typos. Could use a little more editing. Neither distract from overall enjoyment. Worth your time.
2,Disappointed,I have three indoor only cats. We have never had fleas until very recently when the area around our complex's dumpster got infested. The fleas must have hitch hiked on my ankles because my townhouse is now completely infested with them. I bought the Frontline to use in conjunction with the $100+ spent on spraying the house and yard top to bottom and all the smelly shampoos. Sad to say the fleas are still sucking my cats dry. Just shampooed one of my cats 3 weeks after applying and I counted at least 40 fleas in various stages of development. Won't be using Frontline again.
1,Verified FAKE,Just took the cat to the vet who were instantly skeptical that it was real. Its not the same thing based on where its made and this stuff is made in france not the USA and the people I spoke too said it very much makes a difference. I couldn't be more pissed off.
2,slow acting?,I thought this stuff would work pretty fast. But I still see my cat scratching... Could it still be fleas?
4,A cute pattern on a high quality item,"This is a nice set of dishes. They are sturdy and take a lot of abuse. Therefore they are good choice for a family with children.There are two things that I feel that I need to mention. The mugs have a pattern inside them. That was a pleasant surprise. The bowls are absolutely huge. They are 28 ounces. In my opinion that is more like a small serving bowl than a cereal bowl, which is what they are supposed to be. Unless you like to eat a half of a box of cereal in one sitting, they are impracticable. They are too deep to be a soup bowl. I don't know what Pfaltzgraff was thinking when they decided to make the bowls like that."
5,What a terrific book!,"I think that this book was amazing. It is what I would call ideal fantasy fiction, a wonderful plot with likeable characters. It really involves you in the story, you almost feel as if you're travelling with them on their journey. Once you've started it, you can't put it down. A must for lovers of fantasy fiction as it is full of new ideas."
5,Delightful.....,"I bought this from Stephanie and Hod O'Brien after catching their act in Key West a few years ago. They were delightful folks and the music in this set is even more delightful. Straight ahead swinging. No squeaking and honking. Just excellent jazz. While Stephanie can't help evoking memories of June Christy, she is her own talent with phrasing that comes across as ""Nakasian"" and as easy as pie. O'Brien is one of the many unheralded, yet, excellent pianists who can swing and stay within himself without over-reaching. His piano compliments Stephanie very well. Delightful to hear. Phil Woods plays very nicely on this set and doesn't try to take over the limelight. Excellent music. Jazz is not dead...."
1,Not What I Expected,I was very disappionted with this organizer. The cost of shipping was almost as much as the book itself. It is made very poorly and doesn't hold many coupons at all. The pockets are only made of paper and seem like they are going to break soon.
2,"Existential stories are hard to pull off, and this just isn't working well...","I'm halfway through and (I never thought I would say this) am not considering getting the last two episodes.Spoiler Alert:Fictional characters meeting the writers/actor kind of story sounds cool over a beer, but I have never seen it pulled off well on TV."
3,one last hur-rah,"Let me be clear - this has several great moments, but struggles to be even a good story: definitely not a best of Red Dwarf. Wouldn't be worth the price without the extras. If this is the best script that could be filmed, any other future 'final episode' should be left shelved and dusty."
5,It's been a long time coming,"While there are things I wish they would have done differently, I'd have to say my biggest wish is that they'd come out with more DVDs for me to buy.The story was good, the ending was top form Dwarf, and seeing the crew doing what they do best is, well, Definitely worth the price of the DVD. I only wish there were more."
5,THE Best VB6 book for fast results.,"I don't know how any of you rated this book a 1 star, unless you're some student who hasn't worked with VB before. The purpose of the book is to give you fast results, especially during situations where you have deadlines. Some of us don't have the time to write hundreds of lines of code to perform a simple task, this book gets to the point. A must have for computer consultants as well as software developers."
2,Dissapointed.,it only helped as much as help index that came with the VB software. not enough detail or explanation to really learn each function in detail( or useable level). basically it comes down to....how to execute C++ from VB... look page 1234page 1234: here is the sample code. copy this code to visual C. copy this code to VB. that's it! next!
3,Basic introduction to skin care,"This book is a piece of the holistic puzzle. It is presented beautifully with many pictures. But as for content, I felt it was lacking substance. There is a chapter or two dedicated to meditation and excercise, yet no examples of how to meditate or how to stretch or excercise. It is like reading a compilation of magazine articles. A quarter of the book is dedicated to basic health recipes - soups, rice, vegetables, beans, meat and poultry, dairy and desserts."
2,Not Awakening A Whole Lot To Be Honest,"Essentially one large advertisement for the Dr. Hauschka line, combined with a poorly written self-love motivation, I found this book to be rather blah. No new information about the product line, very mediocre home recipes, terrible food recipes and lots of really beautiful pictures that could perhaps be considered inspirational. Skip the book, take a bath and give yourself a face mask instead."
4,Great book for large group gatherings of any kind,"I actually checked this book out at the library recently. I was looking for ideas for an activity at our church that needed to be for all ages and over 100 people. We were able to formulate ideas for an easy meal, activities, and a dance w/ music everyone could enjoy. I am anxious to use this book again for my family gatherings in the future."
2,Size Problem - Rectified?,"A sizing chart is desperately needed for this item. Based on other customers guidance (in Amazon reviews) that these fins run really small and were numbered according to women's sizes, I ordered a pair of large 8-9, since I wear a size 8.5. The fins were huge on me, both in length and width. Sadly, if I ordered them again I wouldn't know whether to order one or two sizes down. As of December 2010 the Speedo website does not provide a sizing chart which relates fin size to men's and women's shoe sizes. For that reason, I will not try to order these fins again, even though I liked the look and feel of the pair I ordered."
2,Not for training,"Hi everyone!!! I Bought this fins for training laps and they r way to big ((the fin part) the foot size is perfect haha, but remember u have to buy one size larger that the one that normally fits u)) so my point is if u want to buy this for training DONT!!! this r more for snorkeling or may be for some diving.The ones recomended for training r the short ones (I leard this the hard way)"
3,"Speedo Rubber Swim Fins (Large, Grey)","These are good swim fins, but they were too small and I had to ship them back and order some bigger ones."
1,"positioning of ""fabulous bill harris"" is incorrect","""FABULOUS bill harris"" ,guitarist, is confusingly positioned between CDs by the outstanding trombonist, bill harris."
3,"""NO THANK YOU"" MEANS I WANT YOU TO KNOCK ME OUT AND TIE ME UP","This is another run of the mill abduction film with the twist of it being in a parking lot. Angela (Rachel Nichols) has to work late on Christmas Eve. Through a series of events she is abducted by security guard Thomas (B-star Wes Bently). Bently attempts to be creepy, but face it, the guy is no David Hess. In fact he isn't even as good as Eric Roberts. Girl gets captured. Girl uses wits to escape and hide. Girl gets chased. I'll leave the ending out because there may be someone out there who has lived in a cave and doesn't know how these films end.There was nothing done wrong or bad in this film, just done countless of times before and better. Now on the bright side Rachel Nichols' 3 star cleavage looks as big in the film as it does on the cover.Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity. Was that a quick body double grope?"
3,"A Dark, Loney Parking Lot","Hidden from any help in a lonely parking lot is Angela trying to get her car started.Help is not on the way as security guard Thomas finds this distressed lady.He's psychotic, she has a good figure.Being tormented by Thomas, her cleavage is exposed. Violence is exposed.Usual horror camp.Three stars is pretty generous for this film fiasco.I would not recommend this whatsoever."
4,P IS FOR PSYCHO,"CHRISTMAS EVE IN A PARKING GARAGE IS NOT SO MERRY. HARD WORKING RACHEL NICHOLS FINDS HERSELF THE PRISONER OF PSYCHO SECURITY GUARD WES BENTLEY.THIS IS A STYLISH THRILLER FUELED BY THE PERFORMANCES OF NICHOLS AND BENTLEY. ALTHOUGH IT LOSES SOME STEAM TOWARDS THE END, IT REGAINS IT IN AN EXPLOSIVE FINALE. IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD FLICK."
3,Effective Little Thriller,"The parking garage is a great setting for this cat and mouse stalker film. It has a few truly creepy moments and some severe bloodletting as well. Nichols reminds me of a younger Briget Fonda here. Overall, pretty good for what it is."
3,We know what we have to do...but help !,"Wonderful book.I strongly agree with the comments from one of the reader regarding information/media activism. We have to move from thinking and talking to real action. As a young activist, I would love to be coached ( like so many others ). We need a system where we could share, get support and empowerment. We learn by action not by information. Sometimes I feel kind of upset, because I feel that people that have the power, network and interest in global issue are doing this for their own ego. Bono from U2 is doing a good effort but why is he not spending his money to help young leaders ? We should invest in those people that will have a tremendous impact localy and abroad. Why not using technology to create a powerful leverage. A place where people like me could get support, coaching in my project ?It was a great book to read, but I felt more discouraged than emporwered..."
5,phenomenal,"This book is amazing. It's perfect for any activist office. There are about a dozen pages that I'd like to photocopy & post everywhere. & the text is a really good collection of quotes, facts, & perspectives. I strongly recommend everyone read this book!"
1,Why pay to read advertising?,"There is VERY little of value in this book. For example, if you aren't sure whether sex slavery and child exploitation are good or bad, this book will tell you. (Answer: they're BAD.)The glossy, MTV hyperstyle is like reading a magazine that's ALL ads--anything important is lost in the hype. (Message: ""Anita"" GOOD.)Of course, when the author, head of the ""multilocal""(???) Body Shop, lists CEO salaries, hers is nowhere on the list.The Body Shop should GIVE you this tree-slaying book; you certainly shouldn't have to pay a dime for it."
4,Enjoyable,"A very enjoyable personal narrative of aspects of the national and international chess scene. If you are interested in instruction, get Silman and Watson."
1,Don't say you haven't been warned,"I'm really angry at the glowing reviews this book has drawn, quoted at Schultz's web site and on the book's back cover. I've wasted my money on it on the strength of them. I'm begging you, don't make the same mistake. The book is self-published: let this garbage stand as testament to one man's vanity."
1,Aweful Aweful Aweful,"This is a book that I would suggest putting down in favor of television. As Truman Capote once said ""That's not writing, it's just typing"".International Master Jeremy Silman calls this ""one of the worst chess books I've ever seen"". Save your money and save your brain by avoiding all exposure to this book. Instead spend your money on ""Zurich International Chess Tournament, 1953"" or ""Pawn Structure Chess"" or even ""Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess"". But don't waste your hard earned cash on this waste of paper and ink."
3,georgina,UPDATE:The company emailed me and offered to send me another one andrefund the old one as long as I send it back and they are sending me a return label.THAT IS PROPER CUSTOMER SERVICE :)
2,Unsure about new design,"I received this pillow as a gift. I had been planning to buy an original Boppy pillow, and I remain somewhat dubious about this newer design. It is difficult to hold comfortably on my lap, as the extra fabric tends to get in the way. I also find the denim fabric dull and unattractive. I still intend to purchase an original Boppy, because I am fairly confident that the original design will work better."
5,Pinall Book,A wonderful book with beautiful photos. Even if you aren't a fan of pinball machines you will appreciate the artwork. A great price from Amazon and as usual fast service. Why drive to a store?
3,Average game,"After growing up watching the ""Jaws"" movies I was pretty excited about the game. I figured that it would be great to be able to go around, killing, as the shark. It's a fun game, but it gets old real quick. The price was good & it's something that I still come back to play from time to time. There's alot better games out there, so don't rush out to buy this one."
2,Jaws Unleashed? More like Jaws can't do a freaking thing with!,I am a honest to god X-Box gamer. Me and my husband both have had our X-box since the day they came out. We have played and own a lot of games. We try to be fair with our ratings and opinions of games.With that said... Jaws Unleashed SUCKED. It was hard to control Jaws and the plot was just lacking in many areas. It was like they rushed to get this game done and it was not even half way decent. Don't waste your money on this game. There are much better ones out there to play!!!! I had mine only a week and traded it in at GameStop.
4,these guys kick so much a@@ it's ridiculous!!!,"a great new band with the guts and skillz to put out a hard hitting, unique sounding record. the only problem with the ep is that it's too short. i can't wait for secret life to drop!!"
2,"Sweet, but too damn short!","The music rocks, the animation is incredible, but the whole thing is over before you even have a chance to get interested.I really wish there was a full length version. Don't buy it. You're basically buying a trailer for a movie that doesn't exist..."
4,Black Delivers Again,"It should be no surprise that Frank Black's newest record is excellent and is filled with emotional, catchy, wonderfully-written songs. It was recorded on only 2 tracks which creates an interesting sound to the record. If you like the other Frank Black records, you'll love this one. Check out thirsty.8m.com because it's the greatest!"
4,better live,"when i first listened to this albumn, i thought that i liked the first frank black and the catholics cd better. i haven't changed my mind, but i must say that when i saw them live, the songs were definitly more enjoyable than when i first heard the cd.i respect Mr. Gilbert, but the lead guitar work was much better on the first albumn. it was more sparse and used negative space much more effectively, which i appreciate. the lead on this albumn was just too congested for me. it's not worse, just different and i prefer the first cd over this one, mostly because of the lead. but this cd still rocks and is a must have for anyone who likes frank."
3,"Excellent production, excellent musicianship","Well, I have to hand it to these guys. The production is excellent. The playing tight, the vocals are tight, and the hooks are perfect. The only thing I have to complain about is the lyrical content. It's not horrible, just a bit cheesy at times.""If I had a fork, I'd just want to stick it!""Yeah, ok. But still a good debut, and I'll be looking forward to the next one!"
4,perfect fit for our Fisher Price baby monitors,"These have the correct adaptor for Fisher Price baby monitors, if you're looking to upgrade/replace the rechargeable battery pack(s)."
2,is Boris Morros reliable? Amazon provides again,"Was snot convinced the author told the entire story, and omitted parts not favorable to him.As to the paperback I received, this ws the first time what I received as a used book was in very poor condition.dan davis santa maria, ca"
5,Loved it!,Just read this right before Mardi Gras......perfect timing. I'll have to check out this author again. It was a good mystery and a surprising ending.
1,What She Doesn't Know,Did not like this book. Started to read and after a couple of chapters I quit. Characters did not hold my interest.
1,The other reviews are misleading - Stay away!,"I picked this up due to some of the hype and the positive reviews here... I don't know *what* the other reviewers were thinking! There was nothing original or new here, and the music, apart from being trite and unoriginal, just wasn't very good. I found myself forced to skip past certain tracks on several occasions because I couldn't take it any more. Definitely not worth picking up unless you want to satisfy the sort of curiosity that killed the cat."
2,Okay for one Halloween,"Looks good, a little on the small size, particularly wig. Not particularly durable, sash unraveled soon after opening package. However, received lots of compliments and provided a good overall costume experience."
4,Where have thou gone oh Fleming & John,"One of the best if not the best Christian alternative album of the 90's. A strange mix of Led Zeppelin,blues, grunge and chick rock..Every once in awile they make an appearance on myspace or facebook saying they have new music coming out but it has been about 11 years since there last album...Great songs:Break the circleLove songsRain all DayBad reputationGood songsI'm not afraidLetters in my head6,570Place called loveNot badDelusions of grandeurHanging on a notion"
4,Seminal grrrl-rock from the 60s,"A record that time and opportunity forgot. The seven songs that this all-girl band from the mid-to-late Sixties released are pretty good; the 13 bonus demos/live tracks are a revelation! The guitar and bass are fabulous; the vocal harmonies are strange, haunting and beautiful; and the lyrics and delivery are alternately tough and heartbreaking. A lost classic from a band that deserved more. 'Up Down Sue' and 'Portrait' are highlights for their garage-pop and sheer guitar hero(ine)ics respectively."
5,worked for me,I'll keep it short and sweet. I'd never played a banjo in my life. I was able to learn all the songs in just a few weeks from this DVD. Plan on buying more MM dvds. I'm into it.
3,Great product with HORRIBLE shipping.,"I work with diabetics and people with very low immune systems and am always looking for a great sugar-free snack to serve them. I have been buying these stoned wheat crackers in bulk for quite some time but will not be ordering them again. The product itself it wonderful, delicious and versitile. The way it is shipped is absolutely appaling. I had contacted Amazon to let them know how dissapointed in the shipping I was, hoping it would improve so I could keep purchasing them, but to no avail. I would say that about half of all the crackers I ordered were smashed and broken and turned into crumbs. The excellent price was not actually a deal as I was being shorted half my order every time. Looks like I need to find another supplier."
2,Crackers are cracked,"Bought this several times, but won't again. The last case (they make you buy 12 boxes at once) contains broken crackers, cracked into several pieces and hard to use. The case must be very old -- there is no date so it's hard to tell."
4,Just try and sit still...,"Frontside has generated a great album full of very dancable beats and distorted and filtered guitars, 303 lines, and cool samples. The production is fairly unoriginal, the album doesn't take to many chances (unlike Unkle, Underworld's ""dubnobasswithmyheadman, and Moby). Never the less, it still can groove and will throw you into overdrive. My favorite tracks are "" Evulva"" and of course ""LBP"".If you liked this, I recomend: Pills ""Electrocaine"", Juno Reactor ""Bible of Dreams"", and Cirrus ""Back on a mission""."
4,Easy to emplace--just need to find more stakes,"I was very happy with this product when I unrolled and spread it in the yard. It stretched nicely over the koi pond, and is strong enough that it didn't tear when it caught on the rocks around the edge and waterfall. I found that leaves had settled on it after a day or so, but it's far easier to remove them now in ten seconds with the leaf blower rather than in 10min. with the skimming net. I haven't had any branches fall on it yet, so I'll update if that happens and anything tears, but for now it's great. My one (minor) complaint so far is that it only came with a small pack of stakes, and I really felt like I needed more to keep the net tight to the ground all around the pond. I'll probably just try to find some sort of substitute stakes at the hardware store."
2,The photo is wrong,"The photo is not that of a blow gun, rubber tipped or otherwise. A blow gun has a hand release lever and a tube leading to the rubber nozzle. The photo looks like some sort of gasket or grommet, totally unrelated. To err is human."
5,One of the best live albums ever.,"The searing guitar work alone is worth the price. This CD is the necessary companion to Reed's ""Rock 'n' Roll Animal."""
3,Happened to notice 2 minor errors...,"The example at the bottom of page 12 says ""...takes a revolver out... checks the clip..."". Revolvers don't have clips, they have cylinders.The bottom of page 32 says ""...there is no explanation of how the detective... came to know the old woman..."". Not true, Tibbs is led to her by Harvey Oberst's friend Packy after Tibbs questions Oberst in jail about where to go for help after getting a girl in trouble."
5,All you need to know abot autism treatment,"This book is amazing. If offers a beautiful perspective on autism treatment. Furthermore, what the book teaches is not limited to child rearing, but all kinds of relationships. It's simplicity and logic are heartwarming.Recommended to anyone who would like to improve your relationships and especially to help your kid(s) with autism.Most highly recommended!!"
4,We had a lot of fun with this toy.,"The game instruction is not very clear and we lost a lot of the cards. However, we can still have fun with it."
4,"Nice quality light fixture, but limited light output","I selected this light fixture to replace a similar one already installed that was falling apart. The swap out was simple and the quality is good.My only knock is about the limited light output given the 25 watt bulb max rating. Since the fixture is quite decorative, conventional clear bulbs look best, but a total of 75 watts is not quite as high as I would like for my placement."
1,This is NOT the book you want to study for the ACT!,"At first you may look at this, and think, Arco is a major company, and this book should be reliable. It is not. The tips it gives you at the beginning are ok, but it goes downhill from there.In the English section, questions seem all right. But in the Math section, some of the questions have no answer which is correct, and some just make no sense at all. The Reading Comprehension section is decent, but the Science Reasoning sample test is simply AWFUL. The answer explanations make no sense at all, and at many points, they omit diagrams that are needed to answer the questions. They omit at least 1 flowchart and several tables needed.This book is definately not recommended, unless you want to be confused and get lower marks on the ACT!!"
5,In-Your-Face!,"McMahon is as sarcastic and entertaining as ever! He still has that macho football player swagger that makes his insight and commentary hilarious. This book is a must read for any ""real"" football fan."
5,The best ever,"I review and found the book is extremely useful for experienced programmer. The structure is confused but when I get used to, it became handful reference."
1,I have no idea how this book made it on the shelf,"This is definately the WORST book I have ever read. The authors constantly repeat material. The whole of the book is only about 40 pages, repeated over and over and over. In several instances, they even used the same EXACT text, they just cut-and-pasted to make the book look bigger. The book contradicts it self so many times I gave up after only 249 of the 788 pages. This book was obviously written by people who know nothing about XML. It reminds me of those papers I wrote in school when you had to stretch a 1/2 page paper into a 5 page essay. To be fair to the authors though I have read reviews on the other XML books in Amazon, and it looks like they are pretty much all below-standard quality. I have no idea who would put a 5 star rating on a book like this."
5,DALE!!!!!!!!!,"Wow what an excellent little ep from the melvins multi talented drummer. These songs rock!! they are definately grunge, no other word for them. Mediocre lyrics and riffs, which are constructed very well and performed beautifully. Simple yet so very effective! Definately the best of the 3 solo eps from the melvins, dale crover shows us he's not just an awesome drummer but an accomplished song writer in his genre."
2,A real disappointment,"I have been very disappointed by this book. Approximate at best on several occasions and written with way too much emphasis. There is a point where it just kills the credibilty of the book. Max Hasting's book for example, though far less accentuated on the hard fightings of the war is the work of an historian, not of a novelist.The global synthesis of a whole conflict is not an easy task for sure but in this particular case the goal wasn't achieved."
1,Worst cd to come out of the 80's,"I bought this on casstte , to see what all the hypeabout?Well it isn't much write home about.severly over production on keys and synthesizersor lack there of?it sounded like 5 yr old; was playing keys & synthesizersI never heard something soo....... bad.sure it was the 80'sthe songs are just awful,. I never heard such repetive....nonsense! in my life. I thought this was a early rap cd.?Martha Davis is famous for the songs only the lonely &suddenly last summer as well as others.I just don't know why she did this album?I have over 300 + cds in my collection .mostly 80's music this album goes away in the foregetpile.There are alot' more artist out there, deserve your attetionLike Quarterflash's Back In The Blue, Heart's self titledMike& The Mechanics and many others.I can see why ( One Way) did not reissue thisback in 96.if must by this.? buy it on cassette its worth about $ 5.00"
2,Give it a miss,Looking for Allibrandi is the story of Italian girl growing up in Australia. From page one it is easy to tell your in for a boring 261 pages of steryotypes and clishe's. The Author obviously has no idea what she is talking about and should stick to school teaching.
5,"sassy ""coming of age"" book","Josephine Alibrandi is a smart sassy 17 year old finishing her last year of high school. She has been raised by her single parent mother, and her strict Nonna.The year is a big one for her, she meets her father for the first time and gets to know him, she falls in love, and she begins to understand her heritage, her Nonna and becomes proud of it.This is a really great book, with wonderful characters that really hit the mark. Josephine leaps right off the pages as does Jacob, her parents and her friends. I have seen the movie, which l also enjoyed and knew what was about to happen, but still it had me in tears.I was so happy for her when her father walked beside her at her school and she felt like ""Wow, so this is how it feels to have a father"".This girl really grows up during the book, and I hope the author gets around to writing more fantastic fiction."
5,What I Thought........,"This is such a great book!!! actually it's one of the best books I've ever read. It's my fave along with ""Soup for the Teenage Soul"". I think this would be a great book for any teen. Josie is an Italian living in Australia and she is caught between two cultures. Also she goes to a very rich school with lot's of weathly people who she mixes with but she is not one of them. She is there on a Scholarship. Throught out this book she deals with her long lost father. And other members of her family. She also deals with the usual teen troubles and is caught between 2 guys who come from 2 different worlds. I seriously could not put this book down. It's a *MUST READ* and I can't wait for another book by Melina Marchetta!"
5,Great tabletop tripod.,"Awesome compact tripod. Makes for a really sturdy base when set on a table top, and would strap well to a pole. Good for macro photos. The ball joint holds securely. Great addition to the camera case."
2,"Flimsy, not for DSLR or m43","Very flimsy construction. The legs bend even under much lighter than DSLR micro43 Lumix G1 with kit lens.Also the rubberized ""shoes"" that are supposed to prevent slippage are made of glossy slippery plastic that defies the purpose.Would have been a nice tripod, if made of glass fiber filled nylon with rubber shoes or smth similar. This one looks like a knock off."
2,errors everywhere,"This is one of the worst spectroscopy books, even by spectroscopy textbook standards. Providing a broad survey of spectroscopic techniques, our class encountered errors all over the book (just like the chemical literature!!). Example problems could have been better selected. I use the book for its tables (IR table, specifically) only. Experience and NMR calculation software will top this book as an aide to the synthetic chemist."
5,Doug Ward's Guide To Cruising & Cruise Ships,"Detailed and descriptive, this reference is ""tops"" in the field. Doug Ward's high standards and detailed critique of ships will enable you to select a ship and itinerary so that, upon disembarkation, you'll be thinking of your NEXT cruise vacation. Bon Voyage!"
3,A book I couldn't finish reading,I usually love Sarah Graves home repair series but I could not finish this one. I think it is because my husband was in law enforcement for many years and the story was too close to home. I could easily imagine it happening and did not want to continue reading the story.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As a new mom of twins, I received this along with many other similar items at my baby shower. This is by far the worst product of it's kind. It is almost impossible to get a baby into the harness. Once the baby is in place, all the rocker does is vibrate - fast or slow. Being advertised as a ""rocker"", I thought it would rock automatically. You can rock it with your foot, or with your hand, however, it isn't even inclined enough to really rock smoothly. Additionally, it doesn't play music, and the toys that are attached are dull and boring. My boys did not like being in this rocker at all. If you are looking for such a product I highly recommend the Fisher Price Baby Papasan Bouncer. It is comfy, it vibrates and plays music. My boys loved that!"
4,Pretty nice product however...,"Our son has been sleeping in his rocker and he is now 6 weeks old. He falls asleep in there more easily and being at an angle helps with his reflux. However, the vibration mode on the chair is broken and has not worked correctly since we received it as a gift. It worked off and on at the beginning (first few days) and then stopped totally.I plan to see if the store will replace it this weekend. We do not have a BRU in our town but are traveling to a place this weekend that does have one. I would like another one if it will work correctly...if not I will try something else."
2,Does not fit 92A1,"I'm sure this fits a Beretta 92FS just fine, but it does not fit a Beretta 92A1 at all.Product description says ""fits most Beretta 92 and 96 models."" It definitely doesn't fit a 92A1.Not the end of the world... I've used a heat gun to heat the kydex and reshape it to profile around the slightly different frame dust cover and accessory rail on this gun that makes it different than a conventional 92/96. It was only a $20 holster so minimal risk in comparison to investing $70 or so into a Comp-Tac or Blade-Tech holster."
4,very good instruction.,"i have never done yoga before. This is my first time doing yoga. I was struggling between paying money for classes or buying a instructional video and doing it at home. I am glad i chose the later. This video/dvd shows you steps by steps to learn yoga. i have been doing it for 1 months, and i feel better every time after i have done it for 1 hour."
3,I think this was supposed to be part of the next book . . .,"in the series. If not, that's how it reads. You're left hanging, and the entire plot line of the book seemed more appropriate as a subplot of book 6, Undead and Uneasy. I love this series, but it seems like the publisher had the author split one book into two. I feel like I was snookered into getting this book, when it should have been part of the next book."
1,Just stupid,"In a genre pretty much beaten to (un)death, Undead and etc. tries to exhume the moldering corpse of a cliché and breath some life into it by merging with Shopaholic and Brigit Jones-ish chick lit. But it's all as derivative and DOA as you might imagine. With its heavy-handed Harry Potter cribbing, this might qualify for low grade YA reading if not for the (boring) sex scenes.As it is, the characters are at best uninteresting and/or annoying. This is especially true of the lead character, Betsy, Queen of the Undead. I haven't read any other of the series, and so can't imagine what makes her worthy of her title, but then I certainly don't care enough to find out. Not the worst book I've ever read, but not that far from it."
5,Great book. buy the series!,"These books are hilarious, sexy, with a high level of mystery and intrigue thrown in. I recommend this series to anyone who loves friendly vampires... and some not-so-friendly ones. I bought them all and read them far too fast, I want more Queen Betsy!!!!!!"
3,NOT WORTH THE $$$,"I have never written a review before, but after reading Undead and Unpopular I felt so cheated that I had to let other readers know.I am normally a really big fan of MJD. I'v enjoyed her series immensely, but it feels like she's getting a little thin with her stories. Thin as in we're paying almost $10 per 100 pages since this is an extremely short hardcover. Thin as in there is not a whole lot of substance to this latest book. I know it's just supposed to be fun & light but I was very disappointed after reading this book. I couldn't even tell you what the book was really about because she (MJD) just kind of jumped all over the place without really going into too much detail about anything. It might be worth the read in paperback but definitely not in hardcover. If she wants to keep her fans happy she's going to have to put a little more effort (like she used to)into her books. I know I won't be buying the next hardcover. I'll wait for paperback."
3,Fair to middlin,"I REALLY liked the preceeding volumes in this series, but this one was a letdown. It seemed disjointed, and disinteresting. There were many disconnected events, and it ended feeling - to me - unfinished....I willl still try Undead and Uneasy, but I may not be in a rush to do it now..."
3,Nothing New - No Growth,"I have to start by saying I've been fond of this books. I liked Sinclair. I liked Betsy and all her other friends. However, it's getting repetitive. Betsy has not grown into her role as queen, she's grown more STUPID over time. She doesn't think about the consequences of her actions and, all though quaint at one time, it's terribly annoying. The woman doesn't even try. And her vainness is no longer funny because it's being used as a crutch not to overcome her flightliness. If all the author is going to do is write the same stuff over and over again then she needs to end the series and move on. Otherwise, have your characters mature.....PLEASE!!!!"
5,Davidson has done it again!,"She just keeps going! when you think theres nothing more the Vampire Queen could go through she throws something else in there, and it just keeps on getting better! The 5thbook is just as enjoying as the rest of the series, lets hope she can keep it up."
3,If the quality were better ...,"I would have given this set a higher rating. These cards are easy to use and perfect for a beginner, who wants to start reading cards. It does not take much practice to use them, as it would with Tarot or rune stones, for example. I received this set as a gift and I love them, since the cards are beautifully designed.The biggest drawback is the quality of the cards. They are thin and flimsy and cannot be bought by themselves. So, if you need to replace these cards, you have to buy the entire set."
3,Not all that...,"The cards are beautiful, the history is great, BUT I wouldn't want anyoneto touch the cards. They are on very flimsy paper and will ruin from just one sitting. They are beautiful enough to get framed though. If I could return them, I would."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my wife based on the other reviews, which are very positive. It was not at all what I expected. She was unimpressed with it when I showed it to her, so I returned it for a refund. It basically looks like some pink cut glass on a silver chain."
5,Great Book!,I am so excited I found this book! I love reading and wanted my son to get the same appreciation for books I have. This book lets him learn to love books and see children and animals nursing! I want to nurse my son for an extended time and it is hard to find encouragement and this book gives me and my son the view of other nursinglings. Thank you so much!!
5,BUY THIS ALBUM,"It's really good. If you want chill music with class and character, pick up Katherine Schell."
1,NOT GOOD TRANSFERS,"I buy many DVD's form these smaller companies(Marengo, VCI, Roan and Platinum disc). I was satisfied with the transfers on this Marengo disc when I had nothing to comapare it to, but Platium Disc has much better transfers of both these movies. With Platium Disc you have to buy two DVD's. On one you get a great transfer of Carnival(plus 3 other movies). On the other you get a good transfer of Dementia(plus 3 other movies). You even save about three dollars."
4,Great show,Anyone who likes a movie about overcoming. You would like this.I was happy with my purchase and it arrived on time in great condition.
4,The Hammer,Good movie to have around if you teach an ASL class to older students. It's a great movie to show that not all deaf/hard of hearing students communicate in sign language (whether it is ASL or some sign supports) and that sometimes eventually they find themselves in a world that they feel comfortable with.
2,One word: blah,"If you're unfamiliar with the various stories surrounding the ancestors and players in The Trojan War, you might find this book a readable aggregator of the characters and myths. I ended up skimming most of it because I knew the myths and Clarke added nothing new to the story. This book seemed the antithesis of Gemmell, who completely rewrote the War and well-known characters in a way that almost parodied itself and had me nearly throwing it against the wall in fury. Clarke is very conservative and, IMO, unimaginative. Hoping to find something in the happy middle one of these days."
1,Bad,This textbook tries too hard to be politically correct and is an absolute mess from cover to cover. I would suggest getting a much more thorough and organized textbook for advanced algebra and trigonometry.
2,Find another text,"I purchased this book for my student teaching, as it matched what the students were using.It's marginally OK at best, and bounces between topics like a textbook with tourettes. It also lacks in quality and quantity of step-by-step examples to guide students through topics.For example, the section on rational expressions was just a sub-unit of a chapter. Students typically need a heck of a lot more practice than that, and I had to pull from way more outside sources than expected to meet students learning targets."
4,An index is indeed inside now!,"One reviewer said the book lacked an index whereby you could look up, say, the Lagoon Nebula, without knowing its Messier number. That may have been what was revised, as my current copy of the book has an index at the back, and in the front it says ""First published 1998. Reprinted (with corrections) 2000. Reprinted 2001."" This looks like it will be an invaluable guide for observing, although I wish it was a bit smaller in size."
4,Liked the setting,"I really liked this book. Especially the setting. The caribbean, palm trees, snorkling, beaches. The action moved along really well and I loved it!"
5,great price for these midnight classics,"this dvd contains many great obscure films that used to be on midnight movie madness type of shows that's well worth the money. if you're a fan of horror that's not mainstream, i totally recommend this dvd set that's well worth the money."
5,Dragon Wing - Death Gate Cycle Vol. 1,"I was reading the Dragonlance series for a while, but the friend I had borrowed the books from went to college, and took the books with her! So one day at the library, in desparate need of something to escape in, i came across Dragon Wing. It was the only volume in the Death Gate Cycle series they had, but I saw it was by Margaret and Tracey, who made a great team in the Dragonlance series. So, I checked it out. At first it irritated me that little things were different then the world of Krynn, but little more then 4 chapters into the book, I was hooked. I finished it in about a week and right away went out and bout the next book. Now a month in a half later I own all 7 books and just finished Serpent Mage. I cant seem to put the Death Gate down! Even my mom has started reading them!"
5,Fabulous,"This entire series is one of the best I have ever read. I waited painfully for each new book. I have never been disappointed with Weis and Hickman. If you have not read any of their books, you could do no better than to start here."
5,"A great book, well worth the money. . .","DRAGON WING marks the beginning to THE DEATH GATE CYCLE, a series where the first four novels are stand-alones and the action takes place on four seperate worlds. In DRAGON WING we are introduced to the great many races of creatures used in the cycle. There are elves, dwarves, sartyn, and patryn; each race is thouroghly introduced and there is a large aray of characters from each race that grace the story. I liked this book because it managed to go in depth into the minds of the characters, and to create a fast paced, action filled story line all at the same time. There is so much going on in this novel, with it's large and heavily detailed world, that I cannot even begin to synopsize it. All I will say is that anyone who is a fan of fantasy should pick up this book and give it a try. I'm sure you'll be satisfied"
3,CD was fine,"CD was fine, it was a replacement for something I borrowed and lost, so I had to replace it. My friend was ver satisfield"
1,Where is the REAL Cornwell?,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years and have watched her writing decline in her most recent books, even the Scarpetta books. But I was not prepared for this book. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it. The intended humor wasn't even humorous to me; rather, it was tiresome. I didn't care for the characters nor for what happened to them. Thank heavens I got the book from the library and didn't waste a dime on it! Don't waste your time or money on this new Cornwell."
1,I wish I'd have read the reviews before buying this book....,"Like someone else mentioned, this book was like a train wreck...horrid, but I kept reading.I kept thinking that it would somehow get better, but it didn't. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,What a HUGE Disappointment!,This book [is really bad.] I could hardly get through it because it's so scattered and a thumping bore. I think this book only made it to publishing because of the author's reputation. I want a refund!
1,yuck - what a waste of paper,"I always try to give a book 100 pages but could only make it to page 87. This book was boring and not funny or witty. In contrast to her other books, this was so bad, I'm surprised she even wrote it. Maybe someone else did, and she just put her name to it. I was open to her new character (Hammer) in the other books, but now forget it."
1,Going to the Dogs?,"Thanks for your reviews, guys, I won't waste any more time on this one. I wondered if PC's latest offering was subtle beyond my understanding, but no, it's just garbage. That's the trouble with being a formula writer, step outside your formula and you're lost. Isle of Dogs is a load of self-indulgent rubbish, so bad it's almost unreadable. So I'll flick quickly to the last pages and save myself the agony of reading the rest. Sorry you're in a rut, Patricia, hope things get better soon."
1,Isle of Dogs Belongs on a remote uninhabited Isle,"My choice for a rating has no stars!I have loved her books until now & have read them all. She has been one of my favorite authors.However,this is pure drivel and if it was supposed to be humorous she failed miserably. I finished reading it only because I had nothing else to read at that time, but kept hoping that it would get better. It did not.Don't even buy this book second hand, or third hand, actually don't waste your money, to think I bought this new in hard cover, shame on me!To Pat C.......stay with what you have done and know best. Kay Scarpetta! Hopefully your readers will come back to you."
1,Don't Bother with this one!,I bought this as I usually love Patricia Cornwell novels. I was very sorry I bought this one. Could not tell if it was meant to be funny or not. It isn't. It took me forever to read it because I could not get interested and stay interested for more than a page at a time.
1,"A ""dog"" of a book!","...In an apparent attempt to juice up an otherwise dull plot, the author hauls out all the negative Southern stereotypes, with the result being that most of the characters are gratuitously slow-witted, snaggletoothed and inbred...I'm a fan of his and Cornwell's work doesn't come close. I enjoy humor and can laugh at myself, but her attempts at emulating Southern speech and characters are just pathetic. My family is from the South and I have something of an ""ear"" for Southern speech, and this ""dog"" don't hunt."
1,I wanted a refund,There is a certain betrayal that comes from loving an author's work for YEARS then having this lemon tossed in your lap at full price. I don't mean to be cruel to the writer.... maybe MOST of us just don't get it... I'm not sure. But I hated it and didn't pick up a PC book for a very very long time thereafter.
1,Don't buy this book!!,"I have read EVERY Patricia Cornwell book, and this is absolutely the WORST of the bunch. She must have a contract to produce a certain number of books per year, because there is no way a publisher would ever print this book for a first-time author. A sophomore in high school would write something like this. It is horrid. It is garbage. I can't figure how I even finished reading it - I was hoping there would be something good about it. But no! It is a genuine stinker. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.And my wife didn't like it either. She gave up on page 48."
4,Isle of Dogs,"I feel compelled to defend this book. True, it's not like any Patricia Cornwell I've ever read, but who says you always have to be ""nose to the grindstone""!I totally agree with another reviewer, that said this is a MUST LISTEN to book. The audio version is HILARIOUS. My husband and I listened to it on a vacation we took and both of us were laughing out loud at the outrageous characters that populate this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was for the slow start. I loved it!"
1,Unreadable,"I expected a ""different"" book - no Kay Scarpetta story - but I couldn't believe how terrible this book was. I very rarely am unable to finish a book, but I had to get rid of this one."
2,A mild disappointment but let me give a recommendation,"This book was a mild disappointment. Patricia stretched a bit TOO far on this one but I'll give her credit for trying. The class book this season for Cornwell readers, IMHO, is Hickam's Sky of Stone. A great, magnificent book that Cornwell fans will absolutely adore. It has a wonderful heroine, one of the first female mining engineers who is bound and determined to show she can get underground against the superstitions of the day. A great love story, too. Mr. Hickam, best known for October Sky, is definitely ""mining"" for Cornwell readers."
1,Isle of What?,"I am an extreme fan of Pat Cornwell and when she went from Scarpetta to Hammer I was leary to make the switch to the Judy Hammer. The first two books in the Hammer were great and I would have given theses two books between four and five stars. The Isle of Dogs on the other hand I would have given a lesser rating to this book than one I did if you had a lesser rating available.While it is a bit funny, that is not what I expect of her in what she writes, I expect to look at the ""who done it"". I could only get a third of the way through and then that took almost two months to do. I found that it was a book that I found Hard to Pick Up versus her others books that are hard to put down.I may find it difficult to pick up another Judy Hammer book in the future. All I ask is that Pat stick with what got her here.Sorry Pat, this one Your Weakest Link!"
1,GodAwful,"I have given her three chances now and this was ""strike 3"" - it was the worst she has ever written and that last one was BAD!!! If she can't do any more Scarpetta, she needs to retire. I am now a Patterson fan, he hasn't disappointed me yet."
1,The worst book I ever read,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read! It is a total waste of the paper it is printed on. I gave it one star only because the rating system wouldn't let me give it 0 stars.I love the early books by Patricia Cornwell, but I was extremely disappointed with this book. The characters are flat and ridiculous. The plot was boring and the writing was definitely not up to her usual standards.Save your money and buy something worth reading!"
1,What?,What a waste of time. I kept reading and hoping the book would get better. It did not. The only reason I would suggest reading the book is if she continues on this story line in another novel you will want to know what Hammer and Andy Brazil had been up to in the past.
1,Keep on looking!!!,This book SUCKS. I have read every Patricia Cornwell book and this is by far the worst book I ever read. I usually get her book as soon as it comes out and try to make it last a week. I fly through her books because they are truly page-turners....but this book is terrible. I had to FORCE myself to finish this one. Skip it and go to the next one in line.
1,Why did she bother?,"Patricia Cornwell has a great talent for writing intense mystery/thrillers and I have been completely disappointed by her lastest work. I found Isle of Dogs to be dry and boring without the famed Dr. Scarpetta. I see many opportunities in this book that could have included Scarpetta even in a background way. I hope that her next attempt will include Scarpetta, Lucy, and her detective sidekick. This is a book you will want to borrow from a library instead of spending your hard earned money."
1,Isle of Dogs,"Take a tip from the title, this book was a dog. I would not have given it 1 star but there were no other options. How does such a talented writer put out such a meaningless plot with meaningless characters that you don't care anything about. I struggled to the middle and then decided my time was worth more than finishing this below average attempt at a novel. Come on, Patricia, get back to the good stuff, that holds the interest of the reader and made you a star author. More like this and you won't get my business."
1,What was she thinking,"I have enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's books for years. When I started reading Isle of Dogs I repeatedly flipped back to the cover double checking the author's name. This drivel could not have been written by the same Ms. Cornwell. Normally, I find sarcastic, negative opinions worse than worthless, but really, what was she thinking?"
1,"I would have pitched this in the garbage, but I borrowed it.","I am insulted. I have read bad books by well known authors, but this is the worst. She should stick to writing about Dr. Kay Scarpetta, even though those are diminishing in quality too. Do your friends a favor, don't loan it to them."
1,don't waste your money,"I should've read the reviews before I wasted my money on this one! I normally love Cornwell's books, but this one is terrible.Save your money, and check this one out at the library. Better yet, save your time and don't read it at all!"
1,Terrible Book,"This book was horrible. The plot was lifeless and confusing, the jokes were lame and the characters were ridiculous--and not in a funny way. Not to mention, the author's racist stereotypes were awful. If you read this book, prepare to be insulted."
1,Save yourself for better things,"This book is beyond dreadful. It depends for what plot it has on improbable coincidences, impossible dialect, and the readers willingness to believe that no one in the state of Virginia has an IQ that rises above room temperature. It's a shame, because the Kay Scarpetta books are invariably entertaining. Don't buy it, don't borrow it from the library, don't waste your time reading it if someone gives it to you."
1,Hands Down the WORST Book I Ever Read,"Why did I feel compelled to finish this book? I kept thinking it would get better, it did not. It actually got more stupid as the book progressed. DO NOT waste your money. I'd rather read a cereal box."
1,what a disappointment,"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, and have rated all her other books with 4 & 5 stars. I also have a personal rule that I give every book 10% of its pages to hook me. Being a Cornwell fan, I struggled through this book for more than 20% of its page total, but final gave up at the end of page 96. Nothing hangs together, the prose and action is totally contrived, and as a fan, I'm feeling ripped off. If you're a dedicated Cornwell fan, wait for the paperback or buy used, or trust me and skip this one altogether. Here's hoping she gets back on track with the next offering."
1,Isle of Dogs,"I have all of P Cornwell's books. This books is not indicative of what she can write. I thought the book very boring, with no real pattern, except to keep the reader lost. I was very disappointed."
1,Why????,"I realize that this book is supposed to be funny, witty and a complete departure from PC's usual fare, however, she should have saved herself the effort. Not only did I find it particulary NOT funny, it was flighty and disjointed without even a hint of cohesivness. Should have been billed as sci-fi fare - the animals would at least have had a purpose"
1,Isle of Dogs IS a Dog,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwells books with the exception of her cookbook. If this were the first book of hers that I read, it would also be the last. I don't understand why someone with a winning style of writing would go off on a tangent,with talking crabs,typing dogs and history lessons of various Virgina locations. This one is BAD."
1,Isle of Dogs is a DOG,"Love Patricia Cornwell, look forward to each new release. However, Isle of Dogs is terrible! I would never have thought it was written by Cornwell. It is boring, poorly written and basically hard to follow. Normally I read a Cornwell book in a few days, I have been trying to read Isle of Dogs for nearly a week and haven't gotten past Chapter 10. My advise is save your money, don't buy the book. It is a real disappointment."
1,What has happened to Cornwell's former creativity?,I am having trouble even finishing this book which I couldn't wait to get my hands on! Did Patricia Cornwell really write this piece of garbage? It certainly is not up to her former standards!! I definitely cannot recommend it. All her previous books were credible and spell-binding; this one is ridiculous. Has she reached the point where she thinks people will buy anything bearing the Patricia Cornwell name? I sure hope not.
1,I hated it.,This was the worst book I've read in a long time. The plot is inconsistent. The characters are absurd. This was my first and last Patricia Cornwell book. I threw it away after I finished it. Don't buy it.
1,Isle of Dogs,"Okay, Okay, I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and most of her books. I was disappointed by this particular one. Ms. Cornwell has been becoming more and more weird with her books. Her earlier ones are much better written with a better plot and more believable characters. If you are a Cornwell reader who loves Kay Scapetta, stay away from this one. No, it wasn't funny. The plot was lousy and the characters......Enough said."
1,Awful,Awful. I picked up the book because I've loved Patrica Cornwell's other books and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. First time I've felt an author should refund my money.Virginians should be insulted with the way they are portrayed in this book.
1,Mind Numbing,I can not believe this book was actually written by Patricia Cornwell. I bought this novel knowing it was not a Kay Scarpetta series but I assumed it would be well written. The HodgePodge references to Nascar; Tangier Island and the unlikable charachters made this book a chore rather than a page turner. The only redeeming quality of the book was the tidbits of history about Virginia revealed in the equally mind numbing columns penned by Trooper Truth; and I am begining to believe this book was more about using up any reference materials Ms. Cornwell discovered in her writing career than to actually entertain her reader. Do not waste your time or money.
1,Beyond disappointing,"Do I have to give this book even 1 star?I've read that Agatha Christie tired of Hercule P. and only continued to write mysteries featuring him because her fans demanded it. Ms Cornwell may be feeling the same boredom and thus attempted to stretch her literary powers in Isle of Dogs. It didn't work. Although she certainly is free to write whatever she pleases, we don't have to read it (and I found this book virtually impossible to read). Isle of Dogs is a sad attempt at some sort of humor which fails miserably. Carl Hiassen does not have to worry; Ms Cornwell simply illustrates how very bad what he does so well can be when done poorly! The talking crab scene mentioned by another reviewer is actually the best scene in the book-the rest is far worse!"
2,"Difficult, disappointing and dull.","I tried to get enthused by this book. I failed. So, I tried again; and, yes, I failed again.I knew from the Kirkus review that this was not the usual accomplished Scarpetta novel, but I was prepared to give it a go. I found the plot(?) ludicrous, the characters so flimsy that they didn't last the length of the novel and ... Well, I guess you can say that one of my favourite authors let me down.The writing was difficult to follow at times and the story seemed to lurch from scene to scene. Often, when an author tries to capture dialect you can see failure laid before you on the page (the most notable for me is Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte), and Cornwell's attempt to capture the inbred, closed dialect of the inhabitants of Tangier Island left me bemused, not amused.That being said, there were a patches of truly well observed behaviour that presented true farce: regrettably they were too few."
1,This is not Carl Hiassen,"The book flap compares this to Carl Hiassen, there is no comparison. In Hiassen's books the stories are real and the characters are absurd. In this book the plot line is missing and the characters should be in a home for the depraved. It is impossible to review the book because it makes no sense. It seems Ms. Cornwell had some characters she wanted to explore, then tried to come up with a story to tie them together, rather than telling a story through the characters. I'm suprised Ms. Cornwells editor didn't have the good sense to stop her from doing this to herself and her readers."
4,Isle of Dogs,A different type of writing than Ms Cornwell usually constructs for her Scarpetta novels. I read Southern Cross which deserved to be a Bestseller and was a nice break from her normal stories. I didn't think Isle of Dogs came close to that book in the way it was plotted. But that will not stop me from continuing to include Patricia Cornwell among my favorite writers.
1,Departure,"This latest book by Patricia Cornwell is such a departure that I found myself wondering who really wrote it. The characters are too goofy to be remotely believable. The character Hammer seems to show the most resemblance to Cornwells typical characters who are notably more sober, intospective and intellegent. I can't imagine why she let this get published and wonder if she wrote it years ago ..say when she was 9 or 10! Too bad for all the people who wasted their money and time and hopes for a good read . This is clearly a bomb!"
1,Snow Job,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read by an author of notable acclaim. I feel as if Ms Cornwell wanted to test her popularity and see just how far her fans will follow her. I'll follow once, but it will be a long time before I waste my money or time on another such venture. The story had some promise at first but quickly degenerated into the ridiculous. If this was an attempt to be quirky, Ms Cornwell sorely missed the mark. Not only would I not recommend this book to someone, I would go out of my way to persuade them not to read it. Shame on you Patricia Cornwell. Your fans deserve better."
1,Isle of Dogs,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and enjoyed every one of them. I purchased Isle of Dogs because I felt sure that I would enjoy it because Patricia Cornwell is a superior author. I was very disappointed. After 1/2 of this book, I could not endure, or spend the time on this any longer. I feel it is offensive to intelligence of her avid readers. I may be missing a message in this writing of Cornwell, but I could not suffer through the entire book. Any and all response to my review is welcome."
3,Towards genre diversity,"It's not as awful as some of these folks are saying. It's just not what we have come to expect from this author. Think of it as a madcap, Ex-Lax fueled Larry, Moe, and Curly romp through Coastal Isles, piracy, and NASCAR - with only cameo appearances by the now legendary Chief Medical Examiner. As flat as ""Last Precinct"" fell, maybe Patricia Cornwell was telling us something. She may have wanted to ""take a break"" from the direction Kay Scarpetta was going. This is certainly a break!"
1,Isle of Dogs,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A PATRICIA CORNWELL FAN. You will be as disappointed as I was when I finally sat down to read it; it seemed that it was written by Cornwell's enemy. Usually when an author is writing about a subject that is a complete departure from the books she or he has written before, the fans get a warning about it. Imagine my surprise! I bought the book as soon as it was published but did not read it right away. So when I finally had a few days off work and sat with several books written by my favorite authors I did not expect the kind of story depicted in Isle of Dogs. Its a crazy story, with unbelievable characters and, frankly, I don't know if it falls into a genre at all. Big disappointment! I will be more careful about buying her books in the future. If it were up to me I would give it a zero star but I am forced to award one star to it; it doesn't deserve it."
4,just listen to this on audio tape!,"I read the book some years ago and just picked up the unabridged version of hte book, read by Michele Hall. You should hear this woman speak Tangerian!!! OH MY GAWD!! she's simply fabulous. This is an oral book -- like some little houses you see for sale in the newspaper, this is one you have to HEAR to appreciate."
1,A Major Disappointment,I've read nearly everything written by Patricia Cornwell and look forward to each new book she puts out but this book was a tremendous disappointment and insult to my intelligence. I tried through the whole book to understand just what she was trying to accomplish with this work but decided that she missed by a mile in making dark humor and bashed just about every group mentioned. Back to Kay Scarpetta please!
2,Weird but OK,"I am a faithful follower of Patricia Cornwell's books but I have to tell that that the whole time I was reading this book, I kept questioning myself as to what the heck I was doing? It IS a weird book - no where in the realm of what Ms. Cornwell has written that I've read -- yet why couldn't I put it down? It's o.k. this time, but let's hope she goes back to writing in the style we are so accustomed to and where we hang on every word."
3,Mixed feelings,"With reading all of Cornwell's books..I was anxious for this one to come out. I am glad that I struggled through this one. Its character development lacked a great deal and the story line was a little to far fetched at times. The over attention to detail was a lot to get through. When I had finished the book though I was glad I had read it. I wish that she would have stayed to mold of Scarpetta. Sorry Patricia...Loved Kay, not to sure about this new line you are going."
1,Disappointed,"Having read several of Patricia's books I never hesitated in choosing Isle of Dogs knowing that it would be a book I would enjoy. Boy, was I wrong. This is a poor excuse for a author of her caliber. Since I have a long drive to work each day I enjoy audio books and I checked this one out at my local library. I couldn't finish the first cassette, it was that bad. Since then I have spoken to several other people and they all felt the same way. I'm just glad I didn't spend money on it, then I would have really been mad."
1,A Waste of Trees,"I have always been an ardent fan of Patricia Cornwell's, but this book will now make me think twice before I spend my hard-earned money on any more of her novels. I finished it, true, but this was no small feat! ""Isle of Dogs"" looks like something Cornwell was forced to throw together to make a publisher's deadline. If she had been an unknown writer no editor in the world would have looked twice at this colossal waste of paper, time and energy! Do yourself a favor and know that ""Isle of Dogs"" is going to the dogs - no Kay Scarpetta here, and unless she returns and Cornwell stops banging out a book for a buck I'll go back to skipping the Patricia Cornwell section - for good."
1,One of the worst pieces of tripe I've ever read.,"I normally enjoy novels by Patricia Cornwell, however, either this book was written by someone other than Patricia Cornwell as a grade school essay, or the author has discoverd hallucinogenics since her last novel. The dialog was horrid and did nothing to develop the characters, which were one dimensional. The plot was not only thin and disjointed, but I believe the author forgot what her plot was supposed to have been in several places judging from its unexplained changes in direction. There seemed to be some hope of all the unrelated and irrelevant characters coming together at the conclusion of this novel in some coherent manner; however, the author missed her one opportunity of redeeming this hopeless waste of a novel. I would call the ending anti-climactic had there been any building of plot, but the novel was just one flat embarrassing stumble through a miasma of mediocrity."
1,Patricia Cornwell at her very worst,"The only reason I gave this one star is because there isn't an option of no stars. Absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. I normally love Patricia Cornwell and have every book in her Kay Scarpetta series, but here she's humiliated herself beyond words. Her editor and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. I will be attempting to sell my copy of this book. What a waste of money."
1,How disappointing!,"Briefly, too many great books constantly being published, this is not one. Don't bother. I'm usually one to read a book to the end, no matter what. This is one of the few novels I could not complete. After 100 pages, I still found the characters and plot implausible and not sufficiently imaginary to interest me. Simply, not worth the effort."
1,EVEN THE CRABS ARE DISAPPOINTED!!,"By far, the absolute WORST book I have ever read in my life. I normally don't like to write bad reviews, but if I stop even ONE PERSON from wasting their time on this book, it will be worth it. I had to see what else Jamie von Becken had on his ""Best"" list so I don't accidentally pick one of those at the library!"
5,Uplifting Peppy Powerful Different Fast-Paced Rolling. BEST,"You know when you hear a song for the first time and it sends chills throughout your body... it's a great song... infact one of my ALL TIME Favorites! It is Uplifting, Peppy, Powerful, Different Fast-Paced Rolling. A DaNce Great for SURE! There is so much electricity and energy in ""Unspeakable Joy"" song #3 on the CD it's incredible. ""Unspeakable Joy"" is also kind of a cool contradiction in itself in that the LYRICS speak of JOY, yet the song has a somewhat evil beat. The BASS is the best of any song I have heard ... Dance, or otherwise. The song twists and turns in idiosyncasies, with great interludes. The Beat goes up and down. I also love the the main Lyrics: ""Unspeakable Joy, as they did not give it, they cannot take it away"". The song says you got to make your own JOY in life. I don't usually Dance.... but I do to this one! I give it 6 STARS out of 5 possible STARS! C. C."
5,This jam is NOTHIN' BUT DA TRUTH BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh my Goodness this song is just the Jam!!! I mean it's the kind of song you can sip a Cosmopolitan or Apple Martini to and then..........JUST LET GO!! ---Hell,even sober it just does'nt matter!! It makes you want to lose complete control on the dance floor, If anyone is against the wall when this plays in a club they have GOT to be trippin' no doubt in my mind."
4,Best voice in all latin america,"Excellent piezes of music, truly worth all your money. Zaa has the best latin voice I'd ever heard-with such well written lyrics and romantic themes that sounds just beautiful."
1,The sound of the artist should be more important than looks.,"I'm sorry if I offend anyone, but I cannot believe how someone can listen to this man's voice and say that he is talented. It is a shame, because the songs are beautiful and the album is impeccably produced. This is just an example of marketing a pretty face to a public ( a la Britney Spears and countless latino actor-singers, etc.) which is, in general, easily impressed by a person's looks and is immensely ignorant about what good music really is. Try listening to some of these same songs when performed by Los Panchos. That's beautiful music. I hope that some day people realize that they have been suckered by record executives and photogenic people with no talent."
4,This book DOES cover the AllTrac models,"While not the best (compared to the Factory Manual, aka ""BGB"" (Big Green Book)), it is better than the Haynes manual for the ST16x and ST18x celica models because it covers all the models, including the rare AllTrac (AWD Turbo) models, the ST165 and ST185. The Haynes covers the FWD Celicas only. This is an important point to make, as I have an AllTrac and the Haynes does not help me at all. Also, this book has a lot more information than the Haynes-- even the thickness (page numbers) comparison should tell you that. For a maintenance/DIY manual, this is something you want to have, especially considering that the next best manual is the official factory manual (BGB) which will cost you about $100 and possible waiting for special order from the dealer."
1,Upset,I was really sad to hear that after only one week after i gave these pendent to a friend she called me and let me know that the pendent had broke. I couldn't believe it.
4,I felt the VHS was missing alot....,"I have yet to see this on DVD, but I knew watching the VHS there was a ton of editing going on. Very, very HOmoerotic..Sure you please all the ladies..and any gay horror fan...hell, I'm straight and i didn't think it was all that bad and Idea for a movie. True, guys runinng around in their underwear does nothing for me..I like the idea of men being helpless!! Victim, and looked upon only for their bodies and faces...this is definetly an expoltation of the male figure. As well, a not too cheesy, but not too good horror movie....Watch is and buy it..it is worth it..."
4,Bad Acting...Boys...,"This is a dumb movie, only watch it for all the guys. That is about all it is worth."
3,slow moving flick,This move is barly over an hour long and does not move very fast. It is your basic scary movie with voodoo mixed into it. The only good thing is seeing decent looking men running around in there boxers.
3,GUILTY PLEASURE,"THIS FILM IS PURELY A GUILTY PLEASURE. IF YOU LIKE B MOVIES THISIS IT. SILLY PLOT, MOSTLY AN AD FOR BOXER BRIEFS. HOWEVER ITWAS A VEHICLE FOR RILEY SMITH AND ONE OF THE ""STARS"" WAS IN BRINGIT ON. BUT RAINY NIGHTS HAVE BEEN PASSED WITH WORSE."
5,HOMOEROTIC ACADEMICS,"This highest rating refers to the ""director's cut"" of David DeCoteau's homoerotic campy but sensual chiller thriller.It already is a cult classic and has quite a following."
2,Voodoo Academy,A terrible B movie. Not worth the time to watch it. Terrible acting and a rediculous plot.Save your money.
2,You Do That Voodoo so Well?,"A high-concept, homoerotic, genre film that - for all its bare chest rubbing, hair gel and glossed-lipped poutiness - falls flat on its face. Even worse acting only tops a lousy script.That said, if you're into barely 20-something boys in spanking white boxer shorts and white socks touching themselves incessantly all over while having a mutual wet dream, well this one's for you! Frankly, I find doing my grocery list more exciting. Surprisingly enough, the production quality is halfway decent, though.Those of us, who like high-concept horror, will hate this one. There's barely an attempt at plausibility, and the level of horror tends to bend more towards cute than scary. Those of you who like homoerotic, this is about as erotic as a PBS film. Is it soooo bad that it's good? No. It's just silly and boring."
1,"Poorly written, badly edited","While the notion suggested by the title sounds interesting, the stories in here lack true professional merit. Cliche plots and contrived storylines make this a disappointing read. I suspect that the author got his friend to write the review for this book.While I give the author credit for trying, this book is merely a self-published, self-indulgent amateur production from start to finish. The author's publishing credits do nothing to impress, as those credits are from amateur magazines and anthologies, and not real publishing credits at all. Save your money."
5,TRUTHS & RIGHTS IS REAL!,"I was in south beach the night this bredren performed at the Marlin hotel and he is definitely about to BLAZE! Unlike most deejays with the same rhythms over and over this is music is a mix of dancehall and reggae. I ain't heard nothin like this youth in a long time. Conscious music, love songs, my favorties are Empress Amazing, Lion Paw, Firm Inna Dis. I got my signed copy at the show- but I got one for my cousin online."
2,Only 10 minutes long,Amost takes longer to read the description than to view the DVD. Sound & video quality low (probably shot on Super 8mm about 20+ years ago).
2,Not worth the money,"Sorry but this cd isn't even worth paying full price for in my opinion. There really are no imaginative lyrics at all, and there really aren't too many songs that even stand out. This seems to be a drop-off from his earlier cd's, and it almost seems like he just rushed to throw the album together. He also has rappers appearing on the cd that no one has heard of before, and their lyrics are worse than his. I have been a Pitbull fan for a few years, but this cd really disappoints!"
2,I DUNNO ABOUT THIS ALBUM,"I love much of his other work. But I'm not feelin' this album at all. I really wanted to dig it, but it's on some other tip. I doubt I'll be listening to this album much. I hope he comes stronger next album!"
3,Adrenal 60 caps,Hard to tell about this product. I have used the liquid in the past. I had a hard time swallowing these. I'll go back to the liquid.
5,Awesome!,"This part of the six DVD is well done. The story takes on a more ""OH my god! The world is in Peril!"" theme. It kept me on th edge of my seat just waiting for the next scene."
3,Mosby's 2006 Drug Cards,"I bought these to help me during my clinicals for nursing school. I'm very pleased with them in general although my only complaint is that some of medicaitons can sometimes be ""bunched up"" on one card. Such as the anti-hypertensive medications. It seemed that most of the meds I needed to administer where on a shared page with others of the same. And while in school at least, this didn't work as well as I would have liked. But that is really my only complain and other than that this is a very good product with a lot of information about the drug on each card."
3,"Neat, But Only Only One Noteworty Cut","The Melvins have a knack for putting out some puzzling EP's, and this is one of them. Only their cover version of Alice Cooper's classic ""Ballad Of Dwight Fry"" actually redeems this record. I love the tune, early Cooper, and the way The Melvins approach any cover. The bulk of the rest of this is pretty hard to take, even for someone like me who appreciates this group. All of side one (I'm a vinyl guy, only do CD's when there is no other option)is a slow droning monochromatic instrumental that I had trouble getting through (only) once."
5,Sharpe's Revenge Collection Set,"Great BBC TV Movie series Sharpe's - ""Fifles"" (5 disc set) - ""Sword"" (5 Disc Set) - ""Revenge"" (5 Disc Set)and ""Challenge"" - ""Perils"", the last 2 being made a few years after the first 14 - 100 Min. Movies. Recomend buying the complete series and watch them in order.Sharpe's Revenge Collection SetSharpes - Rifles Collection SetSharpe's Sword Collection SetSharpe's ChallengeSharpe's PerilSharpe's Complete Collection"
5,Richard Sharpe.,"Although Sharpe is like an early day six million dollar man with more lead in his body than is in an armament this is a don't miss series. We originally watched each episode on BBC America and would recommend the entire series so much so that we bought the dvd's and have watched each episode over and will do so again. There are some truly memorable individuals, but the one that stands out for me is the grizzly old sargeant that is played to perfection in the early episodes by Pete Postlethwaite. I would highly recommend this series to anyone with an interest in early military battles and also to anyone who just enjoys some good drama. Hats off to British Television once again for a first class series."
3,Lotsa big hits and quite a bit of green grass,"This 3CD set compiles every single the Rolling Stones released between 1963 and 1969, with both UK and US A-sides and flips included; plus a good deal of stuff Decca unleashed after the band had fled to their own label. While this might seem like a Good Thing, it does mean that quality control sometimes takes a back seat (actually, when it comes to ... like Sad Day or the tracks from the thankfully MIA Metamorphosis, quality control is standing by the highway trying to thumb a ride). The end result is some of the most important rock ever recorded floating in a sea of naffness. The sound is variable to reasonable on the first CD, more than acceptable on the later ones. Not bad at all, but we still need a well-filled intelligent two CD set of the best of the band's 1960s output."
4,l liked it a lot,good teenage movie. enjoyed it. point is for kids not to get involved with wrong crowd and should always be able to talk to your parents
2,Terrible Pizza Dough,"I bought this book because I really like the California Pizza Kitchen. So, I thought that this would be a great idea to get this book so that I too could make great pizzas. Well, I was wrong. I made the pizza dough twice, and each time it came out terrible. When I was done with the pizza, I took a bite to taste my creation and nearly broke my teeth becuase the crust was so hard and thick.If you need a book to teach you how to make pizza dough, this is not the book to get!"
1,not worth the money at all,this book is way over priced and not even close to what I was told it would be. Its JUNK
3,"Sterling Silver Filigree Heart Pendant 18""","The heart pendant itself is very pretty. The chain, however, is very thin and fragile. Could really use a more substantial chain."
3,size,The pendant is very nice...except that I thought it would be larger. The workmanship is well done. Thanks for the chance to review this purchase.
4,Not Odd!,"If you were to compare this record to the other two records in this series, King Buzzo and Dale Crover, it might stand out as a bit of an oddity and in some ways an inferior record. This is, however, a quintessential Joe Preston record. You can see the shape of things to come: the drum machine excess, the creepy samples, and the slow, dynamic low end drone that he's been perfecting ever since. Listen to what he's done with Earth, SunnO))), and even the first part of the Lysol album and then listen to the third track. The other two songs are reminiscent of Sperm Whale era thrones. This is Joe Preston doing what he does best and I'd like to give it five stars but, as an ep, it doesn't have much going for it beyond the third track. The shorter songs are good and fit in with the rest of the melvins and even early thrones catalog but they are short and in a way seem to compliment the longer track rather than stand on their own."
2,Cheesy music videos!,"This DVD was very disappointing. Not only is the title misleading (It isn't a group of hits. Nor does it include YO SOY AQUEL.), but the whole thing is just poorly shot, poorly staged music videos. Poor Raphael, one of my favorite singers since I discovered him in 1968, looks foolish in just about every clip. If you HAVE to have some of these, settle for the cheaper 'Linea naranja' version. While it only has 6 videos, this one only has 10, and costs more. Or better yet, buy it used. What a disappointment! Raphael's recordings and DVDs have never let me down in these 40+ years.....until this one, that is."
5,Its good,This is a good movie. It starts out kindof slow but it turns out good. Not on a par with some of his other stuff but its very good.
4,Very well researched book by one of my favorite authors,"The book starts off slowly, as Alroy (Javan's older brother)becomes victim to what sounds like tuberculosis and the drugsthat the regents had been giving him for years, thereby sealingJavan's emerging powers when Javan slips on the Ring of Fire.As the book progressed, I found myself drawn further into theworld of the Deryni; her characterizations are VERY precise, andthe people of the books seem quite real. The treachery of Hubert MacInnis and his cohorts was expected, but that they would stoopto what finally happened to Javan near the end of the book was anunpleasant surprise indeed! I had seen that something of the orderwas in the making when Rhys Michael was abducted, when the pace ofthe story accelerated to high gear. Many things happened in thisbook that I do not wish to spoil for the other readers. All in all,a fine read indeed..."
4,Pendragon,"I got the first book for my birthday, and I could'nt tear my eyes off of it. There is action, a little bit of comedy, and a great plot. I can't wait to read the others. Eragon is a great book too."
2,loose weave,this product is not very good for its intended use. the wax comes through the cloth. it works if you use two layers at once.
2,Very simplistic,"This is a fairly enjoyable book, but very predictable and simplistic. It feels like a made-directly-for-TV episode of a popular SF series (pick any you want).All the characters are linear, no depth, no nothing, they feel like taken out of children's books.As for the SF ideas -- the connection with ancient Egypt has been done better (see the Area 51 series), but nevertheless was still enjoyable. Other than that, there's nothing much, except some description of technologies which are not very original and do not go into very much depth.It's actually 2 1/2 stars."
3,Just Ok,"I bought this book as a $.99 deal. I enjoyed reading it. It's a very light and easy way to pass the time. It does hop around like two books were written and the chapters got shuffled around.The writer probably shouldn't give away everything so easily. You can see what is going to happen and then it does. You kind of care for the characters, but there are no real surprises. I kept reading the book because I knew what was going to happen and wanted to see how it would turn out.Compare this to something like Sirens of Titan where you keep reading the book because you have no clue where it's going or what will happen next, and it really doesn't stand a chance."
4,Science fiction with a moral or two,"I enjoyed reading this tale of ancient aliens getting stuck on earth (that's part of the story) and having their descendents try to find the records 5,000 years later. The technology of the original visitors and the descendents are radically different given wars and disasters that prohibited earlier rescue attempts. There is enough science for scifi fans as well as ""plausible"" explanations for the great pyramid and other ancient Egyptian structures. The nonhumanoid alien enemies are also fully developed and interesting. I hope the author continues to publish!"
5,Great involving well-written story!,"This book really exceeded my expectations. It's hard to find well-written sci-fi and it's always great to discover new authors. I wish her first book was also available on Kindle, I'm definitely looking forward to any new books she writes. I was very surprise when I discovered that the writer is a woman, and isn't an archeologist, as I first assumed.The story of Resurrection is complex, involving, touching. It's not rushed, it makes you relate to characters, feel their emotions. It keeps you wondering until the very end what is going to happen (well, I had a good guess in the last 2 chapters, but not until then). It's one of those books you can't put down, and once it's over you long for more."
3,Review on Resurrection,"This book is for the adventure reader. It has two story lines: present time and around 5,000 years ago. It is well written, but not my genre of choice. Because it covered so many different characters POV's, I didn't have a solid hero to root for. Maybe that was the author's goal. If you want to see a possible reason for Egypt mythology, I recommend the book."
5,The best you'll ever spend on music!,"This cd is non stop pure soul/jazz. The project that put George over the top. George was no newcomer to music, but to the average non-jazz person, this project opened their eyes to the talent of George Benson."
4,Better than Juno,"People just seem to buy into whatever the critics tell them to like or not like. If you listened to the critics, you went out and saw Juno, which, in my opinion, sucked. This movie is actually better, funnier, but, because Paris is in it, people have to treat it as if it was the worst movie ever made. Watch it for yourself, before listening to others. I'm not a Paris Hilton fan, at all, by the way."
3,The Hottie and the Nottie,"This had sort of an odd title, but I saw Joel from Avatar was in it so would give it a try. I liked it very much..This is what happens too much in life..people are judged by their exterior. A person has to be perfect in school to get noticed..perfect teeth..perfect body..etc and later in life..it is the same..the beautiful women have boyfriends..husbands...get a happy life...the plain women either get the dregs of men, or they get ignored completely...it doesnt matter what sort of person one is..or what sort of heart one has...it is a face and a body...So, I found this movie very enlightening. He did start out after the beautiful girl from his school days, but then realized the girl who was not pretty had the most to offer....I wish all people would see the inside of a person, instead of just the outside.."
2,Southern Rock ??????,"First,I realize that some of the folks buying this new Hatchet stuff are alot younger than me but, this is not SOUTHERN ROCK ! ! Go out and get the first Hatchet album,sorry,CD,or Flirtin' With Disaster,No Guts-No Glory,and the REAL Hatchet's live CD.Hatchet was a rowdy southern boogie band,not a gloomy,distorted guitar,political band.I just saw these guys at a show here in S.C.,they only played REAL Hatchet songs and sounded good so I know they know how to play REAL southern rock.Dave Hlubek was with them but stood off to the side,not the crazy lead man that I had come to know and love.He is back and if the other guys will take their hard rock tsih and step aside and let him write the next CD then maybe it will get some of the magic back and they can truly say that they are keeping the Hatchet spirit alive."
1,never received it,never received it. I ordered two but only wanted one and was told 10 mins after I placed the order that it shipped already.Must have been a lie because I have not received any.
3,Gorgeous Pot Rack Awful Toggles!,"I love this pot rack, it is sleek and functional. I would give it 5 stars except for the toggle attachments. We could only find one ceiling stud in the place we wanted to hang the rank, so we had to use one of the toggle anchors. The plastic holding piece broke off before my husband could finish screwing in the anchor hook, and then there was no more ability to complete the process. Luckily he was almost done, but the pot rack was a fraction of an inch off level because we had already screwed in the first hook into a stud. A folded piece of aluminum foil saved the day. We were able to adjust it just right to the anchor hook to level out the bar. My advice, don't mess with the toggles, find a place with studs. For the price we paid for this pot rack, we should not have had to put on 'band aids' to have it look right!"
5,Great Camera,"This camera is absolutely awesome. It takes great pictures in any situation. I have a professional digital camera and it's a pain to lug around with you wherever I go. This Casio is so compact I can put in my backpack, laptop bag and it's ready to go. It's loaded with features and for the price you cannot go wrong. It goes everywhere with me."
3,Defective Battery,"I got this camera for my sister for her 12th birthday this February. When the product came, the battery was defective. I had to call customer service a few times to try to get a new battery. They finally told me that it happens often and they will ship out a new one right away.The camera itself is pretty thin but a little big. The pictures taken were average. The LCD screen in the back was bigger than other cameras."
1,"Battery is Worthless, as is Casio's Customer Service","As many other reviewers have said, my battery for this camera just died, according to the Casio customer service rep I spoke with. Their customer service representative was not helpful and wanted me to spend more money to get a new battery, because my battery lasted just past my year warranty. If they know that their product has this problem (as it is clearly written all over the web when you search ""casio battery problems"") they should fix it. However, they don't and won't! I would reccomend against buying this product especially if you want something that will be reliable when needed for taking photos. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!"
3,"good camera,bad battery","we have 3 exilims in the family.i bought this for my wife from walmart ,the battery would not charge.took it back 3 times and wisely bought a replacement duracell.all 3 batteries were duds.i called casio customer service and try as i could ,they would not accept that the batteries were defective.the mantra was ""some lithium ion batteries have this characteristic""casio promised to send me one and i asked for one without character.if the battery charger light flashes it's a bad battery"
1,Don't buy this trash,"This camera is a beautiful trash!I bought it 6 month ago for my wife because it looks cute.However, its battery died after 1 month. We called casio and they sent us a new one. But this new one died again yesterday.We are so disappointed with the BS battery. Without a reliable battery, this camera is just a beautiful trash.Don't buy it."
5,Great compact camera,"This is a fantastic camera. The menu bar on the right side of the screen makes it really simple to use and adjust settings on the fly. The ""best shot"" mode is very useful as well, as it tailors the camera's settings for the type of picture you're shooting. It's nice and compact and fits in my pocket comfortably. The pictures look great too"
1,Unbelievable that this was published,"If this book had been sold as fiction it would have been rejected because of the corny dialogue the entire thing is written in. Apparently the author has never read a true crime book. Most are written as narratives. I don't see anywhere a note from the author that dialogue has been reconstructed or imagined, which it had to have been. Don't waste money on this one, or time; it's not even worth reading as a library book."
3,How much can one family endure?,"What makes this story even sadder is that the victim's husband lost his sister to a serial murderer years before. Now his beloved wife and the mother of his small child is kidnapped and brutally murdered. Carla Larson had alot to live for: A husband and child, a good job, and friends who cared for her. The pathetic killer who deserves the same death, tried his hardest to hide the crime, but good detective work got him behind bars."
1,*Gross*,"I must say, what I loved about the first album is truly missing from this one. All the funky vibes, the good old coctail themes that we all loved is not here."
5,Lenny Kravitz rocks!,Did you say Lenny was dull? That song is the only reason I'd but this CD. Critics suck.
1,No volume,"I bought this as a gift, so it was too late to return it, however, there is very little sound on the CDs. I normally play my CDs at 8 volume in my car. I had to turn it up to 50 before I could hear it. What a nightmare when I turned to radio, almost blew my ears out! Tried it on my computer, same problem."
3,Not the original...,"Why can't record companies get is straight???...or am I the only one on the planet who knows that this CD's version of ""We've Gotta Get Out of This Place"" is NOT the version we all heard on the radio in the 60's, nor is it the version which is included on the vinyl edition of this very album... For those who don't know, in the ORIGINAL version of the song, Eric B. sings: ""My little girl you're so young and pretty""...not ""Now my girl you're so young and pretty..."", which is what he says on the wimpy version of the song which is on this CD. The original has much better production and much better vocals. This CD's version is the one you'll hear on oldies radio...since most DJ's don't know the difference either. Message to the record company: stop pulling this garbage--there are folks who know the difference and we want the ORIGINAL version...not some crummy version you paid Eric to re-record for God-only-knows what reason."
3,Good show for the person looking for the hits,Eric Burdon and the animals made some wonderful music. This is a brief synopsis with the most popular tunes to satiate the radio listener...
3,best of,eric burdon is great! The CD transaction was perfect with regard to shipping to my house and the product was packed nice and safe. The CD skips on certain songs and they are the ones I like the best. I will take this as a lesson learned from buying slightly 'used' items. I still haven't tried the CD's in a newer type CD player but they skip on computer and CD player.
4,Liked it more when I first bought it in the 70's,"It came from Japan. I was looking for the album for years on discu, so I'm glad I found it. The songs are good, and Pussy, White Lightning and What a Blow are great songs for the bass player who scored over 2000 women. But it was a lot more relevant when it came out."
4,Sounds just like they did on AM radio,"If you like the girls groups of the 60's.The Ronnets have to be there. And as far as the sound issues that some people have,the songs sound just like they did on 1960's AM radio. If you want remastered 60's girl groups I have not found any.If you like girl group collections check out one called ""Chapel Of Love"" and another one called ""Early Girls"" Neither is remastered but I enjoy listening to both of them."
1,Horrible-sounding CD,"""The Best of the Ronettes"" CD is the worst-sounding CD I've ever heard. On most of the songs, the voices of the girls are not as loud as the musical instruments. I didn't have any of the Ronettes' records when their songs were on the charts, but I did hear their songs on the radio and they sounded much better than they do on this CD. Since the songs are all mono on the CD, messing with the graphics equalizer doesn't help at all. You can't get the voices to come in at a natural-sounding mix with the instrumentation. On many songs, there's so much distortion that you can't really hear the tunes. However, the two big hits (""Be My Baby"" and ""Baby, I Love You"") do sound better than the rest of the songs. If you just want those two songs, you'll be satisfied. Of course, Phil Spector was famous for his ""wall of sound"" when he was producing the Ronettes, the Crystals, etc., but on this CD the ""wall"" crushes the voices."
4,Love-Lies Bleeding,Love-Lies Bleeding gives you an idea of what the war was like from a girls point of view. A couldn't get my nose out of it until I had finished it.
2,Verbose!,"The one problem I had with this book was that at the end of a chapter, I didn't feel I learned much. A lot of reading, not much learning. Hmmm. If you like speculation without alot of hard-core facts, this book is for you. One quality worth mentioning is the text about internet encryption to avoid government monitoring."
3,Review for the Uninitiated,"If you're already a Mike Errico fan, then you will ignore what I have to say. It seems everyone who's reviewed this album was already a fan. To fans Mike's the unsung underdog. I bought this album based on Amazon's recommendation and the strength of the reviews below. Mike is talented and I'm sure a great live show, but I'm reviewing THIS ALBUM. This album is not bad, but all I can say is: As Melissa Etheridge is to Bryan Adams, Mike Errico is to Alanis Morrisette. Really, if you love Alanis Morisette, you will DIG this album. What's surprising is a total lack of irony from a New Yorker."
2,AWFUL SUPPORT,"Bought the 5105-s701 in aug. 2002, it broke down soon afterwards while I was working in Europe.Toshiba service providers in Europe wouldn't service it, claimed the warranty was not valid in Europe although the warranty booklet that came with the machine clearly states that the warranty is 'valid in the US and overseas when you travel'.Toshiba warranty center said it's warranty was valid worldwide but that was about all they could do. They couldn't contact the European service provider to sort this out and I tried repeatedly to reach Customer relations at Toshiba HQ but my calls were not returned and emails and letters through regular mail were not answered. Ended up paying for the repairs myself and all further attempts to get it clarified from Toshiba where this warranty is valid have also not been answered.I'm very dissapointed in this support I got from Toshiba andit will certainly keep me from buying Toshiba products in the future."
4,Great for the kids,"This is a great product, size and quality for the kiddos. They are adjustable and comfortable enough that my son wasn't constantly trying to pull them off."
4,"Thumbs Up for the Stones and the Who, Thumbs Down for Yoko!","I hope the guy who called Yoko the ""2nd coming"" was only kidding! Heaven help us! I'm not ashamed to say her ""performance"" is the one reason this CD gets 4 stars instead of 5. If you don't want a headache, skip ""Whole Lotta Yoko"".Never mind that, Jethro Tull and Taj Mahal both give spirited performances (Ian Anderson looked like a kid with whiskers back then!). I like the performance from the Dirty Mac (a 1-track wonder consisting of John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Mitch Mitchell) of ""Yer Blues"". Maianne Faithful's performance is ok.Saving the best for last, we have the Rolling Stones (introduced by John via sign language). ""No Expectations"" was probably Brian Jones' last great statement. ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" is also good. And of course, there's ""A Quick One"" performed by the Who (who were you expecting?). This is a fun and campy reading of Pete Townshend's 1st rock opera."
1,a new low in video,This is as much a classic as a rusted tin can. I discarded my copy in the trash as a service togood Porn.
3,Scanpan Grill Pan,"I purchased a full Scanpan cook set, along with several additional pieces, including the 10.5"" square grill pan. Luckily, these have a lifetime warranty, as I've sent 3 pieces back due to the non-stick coating failing, and recently this grill pan also started flaking off the non-stick coating on the top of several of the grill ridges. I'll be sending back for a replacement, then packing up for use later as they are nice heavy pans. Scanpan may have changed the coating process recently, as my pans are 4 years old now. With so many pans out for replacement, I purchased an All-Clad set, however, I just say the replacement process went smoothly.I am now looking for a good grill pan and will probably try a Calaphon square grill pan, as my friend swears by hers which is over a year old, uses it several days a week, and still holding up. I rated it a 3, but would rate other Scanpans a 4."
3,absolutely average,"i agree with review above on some aspects. however, i feel that the acting was on point for most of the film. clearly, this is the product of actors making the best of a bad script, low budget, and poor direction. The same goes for the music. i enjoyed the piano based score, as if a quiet family film needed complex orchestral arrangement or driving themes. this is a truly average film. where it's not going to win any oscars, it gets the job done as safe family fare."
1,Not worth your time or money,"Ok, I've purchased quite a few books from Anazon, but have never taken the time to write a review prior to this one which I feel obligated to write. I'm a ""Custer buff"" & have read many books about the general & was somewhat intrigued to read this one about his wife in order to get a differennt point of view about Custer & his reputation in the years after his death. I must say that the writing style of Jeremy Poolman is just too frustrating! This book doesn't add anyhting new to the Custer saga that anybody hasn't heard previously. The entire contents of this book is about 20-25% Custer & the rest pure ""fill"" or ""fluff"". This read is NOT worth your time or money."
4,Perfect!,This was the perfect video for my son's 3rd/4th grade class. They were studying Lewis and Clark and the teacher used this to finish off the lesson.
4,More honest than Hot Rocks,"Whoever chose the songs for this compilation got it right. The one that came before it was great but radio has dulled it and the Stones were a blues band with a piano player. They were sloppy and rarely made an album without a clunker or two (apart from '68-72). This is what they were all about. Definitely worth the money, but don't expect to hear lots of familiar radio hits."
3,"HOT ROCKS,PART 2","ALL OF THE MATERIAL THAT NEVER MADE THE FIRST ROUND,THERE STILL ENOUGH HERE TO WARRENT 3 STARS,ALTHOUGH IT'S GOT MORE THEN IT'S SHARE OF JUST SO-SO ""B"" SIDES AND JUST OK ALBUM TRACKS. LONDON COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SELECTIVE ABOUT MATERIAL,BUT BY NOW HAD LOST THE STONES AND PROBABLY JUST DIDN'T CARE.THE LAST TIME, SHE'S A RAINBOW,AND IT'S ALL OVER NOW,AMONG OTHERS,MAKE THIS ONE WORTH OWNING. IT'S STILL A TON BETTER THEN ANY OF THE DRECK THEY PUT OUT AFTER 1973,AT LEAST THIS CONTAINS SOME GOOD STUFF!"
5,Great book,"Wistrich does a wonderful job of condensing information about a huge topic into a very useful small volume. It doesn't go into a huge amount of detail about every aspect of the Holocaust or the anti-semitism leading up to it, but it is a great book for beginners, particularly high school or college undergraduates looking for an introduction to this horrible subject.As the previous reviewer said, Wistrich does do a wonderful job of documenting his sources and I too got a lot of further reading and research ideas from this book."
4,Loaded,"This is a nice little volume. A small book with a lot of information. I consider myself well read on this subject and ended up learning a lot from this book. It was so easy to read I finished it in a little over a week. Wistrich has some great endnotes too. He has documented everything and I got some great suggestions for further reading from the notes. The cover and the type font make this a very attractive volume as well. As stated in previous reviews this is a very good volume for the learned person. Wistrich will bring you up to date and refresh your memory of past details. However, I disagree with it being for the absolute beginner. You still need to be familiar with the non-fiction format and have some subject knowledge in order to get the most out of this book. It also looks great on a bookshelf."
4,Hitler and the Holocaust,"More open and deep of my previous expectations. Few words about Mathausen System (Linz) and the ""industrial"" management of many satellite Work Camps around the main Lager. Anyway great overview for high school."
1,Pilot episode TIME COMPRESSED!!!!,"Notice how everything in the first episode or pilot is un-naturally rushed. Listen to the music. Check it's running time. Then check the running time of the additional episodes. The pilot 21 min. the others 25. Rhino has released this otherwise great show in a TAMPERED with digitally time compressed/edited version. All dvd collectors of classic t.v. want versions better, sharper and at the very least UN-CUT then those shown on Nick at Nite and T.V. Land. Rhino did us no favors with THE REAL McCOYS (EDITED), THE LONE RANGER (EDITED) and add to their list My Favorite Martian!"
1,This is not episodes from season 3,The title is misleading. These are select episodes from the first season etc. No season 3 is included and there never was a season 4.
1,"Ah, If Only The Dead Could Talk","I knew John Fante. We worked together at screenwriting in Los Angeles. While I started out wanting to applaud Mr. Collins' efforts at capturing his subject, again and again in reading this book I came upon unsubstantiated assumptions that I know to be in part or wholly inaccurate. Collins is a decent enough writer but here he takes on alchemy and produces too much hot air. Comparatively, Steven Coopers biography of Fante was at least workmanlike and based on interviews with Fante's widow, Joyce, and Fante's family. Conversely, Mr. Collins' effort appears to be fundamentally realized by intellectual assertion and personal specualtion. Having know Fante I cannot recommend this work. At best too much of it is guesswork and at worst it is insulting to its subject. I have no wish to be unkind to Mr. Collins but I do recommend that he stick to writing about what he actually knows."
2,I don't rate the film but the product: 2 stars,"I'm a Spanish speaker but I always prefer the original audio of a film. When I tried to watch it with the Spanish subtitles, voila!! I couldn't find them. This edition doesn't have Spanish subtitles despite being announced by Amazon in the DVD features.Having watched it with Spanish audio, I realised the 1977 version's audio is Spanish from Spain but the 2004 version's audio is Spanish from Latin America.When switching menus, ugly flashes with colored squared appear.Summarizing, I won't buy the other episodes."
3,Not as good as most people say but it's still an OK flik.,"I rented Star Wars a while back and I thought it was OK. It didn't change my life or anything but I thought it was pretty good. I thought some parts were boring (the scenes on the desert planet nearly put me to sleep) but some parts were exciting (the death star battle at the end). I think that this film should be remade however. It would be neat to see different actors in the roles and better special effects. I think if it got in the right hands a remake of Star Wars could top the original! It's amazing to me how children still enjoy this film considering how old it is. So if you haven't yet seen Star Wars, what the heck, go and rent it. It's worth the $$."
1,Same as most other reviewers...bad quality,"There isn't much to say that others haven't but I'll add my two cents anyway. The quality of the ""original"" movies is pretty terrible. My old VHS copies look better then what they put on these DVD's. It's very grainy, the sound is iffy, it's so bad I had to stop watching it about 15 minutes in.The ""enhanced"" version does look and sound a lot better in every way but it's unfortunate it was ""changed"". If they would just clean up the original properly I'd happily pay another $25 for a copy but what I paid for these was just wasted money."
5,Magic...,Well actualy I wanted to give thismovie 6 stars but it wasnt possible. Reason: best movie ever made...!
2,This is NOT how it was presented in 1977!,"Steven from Tennessee is wrong - this is NOT how these movies were presented. The celluloid from which they were shown had a 2:35:1 aspect ratio - and were essentially ""anamorphic."" I can live with the sound, but it absolutely ludicrous for this to not be anamorphic on DVD. I can encode anamorphic home movies with a single mouse click - from a ""letterboxed 4:3"" source. If Lucasfilm can't - I think they need some new people."
2,A lousy transfer from the 1993 Laserdiscs?,"What a lazy way to do it. Why not release a 1977 only, anamorphic widesreen, digitally remastered version and then see if the fans buy it? Good thing I bought the 1993 Difinitive Collection Laserdiscs back in the day. They weren't cheap but it saves me from buying these."
1,"Star Wars is stupid, boring, and poor.","I can't stand this movie! I absolutly hate this movie! It is so poor, boring, and stupid that I can't make myself get into it. Star Wars has some very cool sound effects but the acting is terrible and so is the boring script. I'd rather watch Sesame Street than this. This movie is for boring grown ups who like boring movies. Avoid it!"
1,Wish I Could Give It Zero Stars,"Non-Anamorphic Widescreen?I think I'll just watch my old VHS tapes. What's the point of a DVD release that ignores the technical specs of the format? We're not talking about cleaning up or restoring the print itself, just formatting the DVD image for today's televisions. On my TV, this DVD is going to have a picture that is stretched and distorted horizontally, making every single character look as fat as Jabba the Hutt. Inexcusable!"
1,Be aware of what you are purchasing,"If you are mainly buying this release for the original versions, please be aware that they do not use the full resolution of the dvd format. They are merely copies of the Laser Discs from the early 1990's, and are not ""enhanced for widescreen TV's"". Buyer beware!"
4,I told you so!,"I would like to refer you to my review of the original trilogy dvd last year:""These are great flicks (I was born in 1971, so Star Wars was my life!), and I will buy the DVD, but I anticipate shelling out another 100 bucks in a couple of years when you issue the super expanded version which contains the directors edit as well as the original theatrical version (ala ""Aliens"") """
1,Young fans today begin to lose interest.,"It's too bad that George Lucas makes Episode IV so precious. It has taken him to release this movie on DVD so long that many wouldbe/couldbe fans have begun to lose interest. There are other more recent films which compete to establish themselves in the psyche of the public (Lord of the Rings to name a recent example). Many kids and young adults weren't even around with the original Star Wars was released and don't know what the hype is all about and frankly many of them don't care. At this point, the longer George Lucas holds out, the more he is liable to lose money in sales. After all, despite what he says...it really is all about money."
4,You people need to shut up,"Ok, in case you people forgot, this movie was made in 1977, before 5.1 surround sound in ur home. All I read on here was how people wanted the ORIGINAL, UNTOUCHED, star wars 4 5 and 6, and here you go. Movies were made differently those days. They didn't have anamic widescreen or digital anything. When you people wanted the ""original"" star wars, this is what you got. You people seriously need to shut up!!"
4,"Not the best ever, but still good","This movie is somewhat overrated (as is any that claims to be ""the best ever""), but still excellent. The characters are memorable and fully realized, and some of the imagery is unforgetable. The downside is that the plot is quite unoriginal, basically just restating all the old hero myths and putting them in outer space. Highly enjoyable, though."
3,"""New"" STAR WARS = a bad idea","Why won't directors leave well enough alone? Director George Lucas has reworked his STAR WARS saga more than Walt Whitman reworked LEAVES OF GRASS, stringing it into so many different versions (in various media) that the original idea was long ago buried in an avalanche of product. The first film (which wasn't called ""A New Hope,"" just STAR WARS) was groundbreaking, thrilling fun. For this so-called ""special"" edition, Lucas added several cheesy CGI images and sound effects, then re-edited other scenes, and didn't permit the original on DVD. The only way to get the authentic version is to find an old VHS copy of it, which loses the wide screen. However, that is preferable to having our memories mugged (as Pauline Kael said of the altered version of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND)."
5,Bout Time!,"A. I love the fact that this was finally released. Sure, it's the transfer from the 93 laser disc edition or something like that. Whatever. This is how it should be. A little dirty, sound like crap and nothing more. It's nostalgic. Han shoots first, No Han telling Jabba he's a wonderful ""human being"". This one thing that urks me though is yeah, you had to buy yet another copy of the 2004 really special edition. The other thing, and this may be just a nitpit, is an extra on Disc 2, the demo for Lego Star Wars 2. Now, why do you include a demo with the DVD, and release the DVD the same day as said game. That just made no sense. Waisted disc space that could have been used for say... the original ""making of"" documentaries, or perhaps the dredded Holiday Special. Atleast that would have made sense. Maybe good ole George forgot about that stuff. But still, it's worth it to me anyway."
1,Low quality transfers of original (and best) films,"Although it's nice to finally have the original movies which made George Lucas into the mogul he is today on dvd, the quality of these versions are low-quality 4 x 3 letterboxed transfers from video. Why do we have to choose between an edited goofy new scenes version and a low quality original? I want the original films in high quality transfers and when HD discs come out, in HD quality as well. Easy to do for Lucasfilm."
1,there needs to be a rating for ZERO stars...,"to all the people who are saying ""stop your complaining, you got what you wanted""...um, no. this is unacceptable and you know it. anamorphic is the standard now, the ""be happy with your 4:3 letterboxed"" argument would have flown, say...5 years ago. but even that is a stretch. I mean, for the love of Peter Paul and Mary, I'm pretty sure you can get ""Ishtar"" and ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" in 16:9...does anyone even buy a 4:3 television anymore? besides, if I was wanting to watch this on a 19 inch 4:3 TV, I'd pop in one of 9 million other versions I already own, it won't look much different. I need something that will hold up on a 16:9 projector or HDTV...that's what watching Star Wars is all about.simply not acceptable, he knows it, you know it, so vote with your dollar."
4,This year's version...,"I've been reading about how George Lucas is getting so much money from us. I guess he is and I guess he will make a lot more, I have to say that I will buy this year's version even knowing that next year there might be a new version (may be on HD DVD), it has always been like this and many other films bring out new art, new features, new cuts every single year... is not just George Lucas, we talk about Lucas because we, the people who write here, care about Star Wars. We asked for this changes so -- the current version is a consecuence and it takes the older version off the market. Besides, this films are not only out there for us, the ones who already own the last year's version... but also for people who has just started his film collection and also for the people who see the original release of Star Wars as an art form and would like to keep it as it was originally achived. I think this version is a MUST HAVE."
2,"Star Wars IV, A New Hope","Speaking of hope, one would hope the same care that was given to the THX re-mastered version in VHS [no less] might have been given to the transfer on DVD.-help us, Lucas, you're only hope. . ."
1,DO NOT BUY RELEASE THIS SUBSTANDARD RELEASE,"If you're buying this to get the original theatrical version, be warned that you're getting a re-hashed 1993 *WIDESCREEN* laserdisc transfer of the original films.Not only will the picture be substandard on digital, widescreen TVs, compared to even the most basic modern DVD transfers from film, but for those of you who want the pan-and-scan version, you will be getting widescreen to boot. There is no pan-and-scan version of the original theatrical release on either the widescreen or pan-and-scan releases of this DVD!There are film elements in existence that could have been utilized to produce a much better-looking transfer to DVD, but Lucasfilm decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost. That being said, if it isn't worth their time, why should it be worth yours?Buyer beware."
2,"Why, George? Why?","I too have been purchasing version of the starwars trilogy for going on 15 years. I just wish that, finally, Lucas would release a properly formatted version of the original films. I don't know if anyone's noticed, but the original unaltered versions aren't in the correct aspect ratio. In fact, I can't even zoom them into the proper ratio, so they look fairly terrible. I wouldn't mind if Lucas re-digitized the video from the original film as he did for the special editions, but after that, he needs to drop it. Cut this cord, you've milked this cash cow for all it's worth. Please, George, do it for all of us fans who enjoyed your films as children and want to have the original version in the best format available."
1,let lucasfilm know,The fact that George Lucas is blind and stupid enough to think that releasing the original trilogy on dvd not remastered or 16x9 enhanced is reason enough to disown these dvd's....But not all hope is lost! If you want to get the original trilogy released in a decent transfer go to the digitalbits or originaltrilogy dot com to find out contact info for lucasfilm and let them know you want and DESERVE better!
5,Greatest Movie Ever!!!,"Like it or not, this movie has inspired so many science fiction films throughout it's release. The characters and story lines are great and so are the special effects(especially in the 70's). This is positively a movie to see."
1,Lucas now lives in another galaxy far far away...,"Lucas has repeatedly changed and damaged one of the greatest film franchises in history by making lame special editions and continues to slap those fans in the face with this new release.Without a doubt the original Star Wars (Episode IV)in its original form was one of the masterpieces of the 20th centuty. Unfortunately restoring it apparently doesn't fit Lucas' artistic vision.Well Mr. Lucas, by looking at these reviews, isn't it obvious that fans are tired of your ""new"" vision of Star Wars? I can safely say that you have lost touch with what made Star Wars great. Not only that you continue to ignore those fans that made you what you are today. Sadly you are no longer a great storyteller or movie maker. Nor the George Lucas that made great movies like American Graffitti and the original Star Wars Trilogy."
5,"Every DVD is re-released Annually, Right?","I have to tell you that I agree with much of what is being said here. First of all, we asked for the original versions and that's what we're getting. While the argument that they should be in anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5.1 makes sense, it also means we're not getting what we asked for.For me this is about being able to finally put to bed my laser disc player. I have a 9-disc set of the original trilogy in it's original condition, but my antique laser disc player won't easily interface with my modern TV. Now I can put the player in the attic and be done with it.As for next year's inevitable re-release of the trilogy in yet another once-in-a-lifetime format, that's a given. It's not just Lucasfilm doing that - half of the movies on the DVD release list are actually re-releases. They send out a second disc with special features and call it a new version. Here's an idea: get the second disc from Netflix. You only watch the second disc once anyway, right?"
5,PULL UP AT THE CANTINA AND HAVE A BREW WITH THE WOOKIE!,"Classic, late 70's space opera was very much the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA of it's day."
1,it's the greatest movie ever!,"this movie left much to the imagination. You really had to get very interested in it to enjoy it. For kids only, I could go on and on, but I'll just bore you to death!"
4,Greedo and Han confrontation mistake.,"Well, low and behold I found a mistake that ILM and Lucas Arts made that didn't have to be made in the first place. When Han confronts Greedo in the Catina, everything is going fine up until the part where Han says ""Yes, I'll bet you have."" In the original, you can hear Han saying the whole sentence. In the special edition, for reasons I can't understand they somehow cut out Han say ""Yes"" at the beginning of the sentence which I thought wasn't neccessary to do so. Now, it may not annoy you but it does annoy me. Also, when Han confronts Jabba after that, Han tells Jabba he's a wonderful human being. Now we all know Jabba is not a human being. I think they could've changed that somehow and those are the reasons why I give it four stars instead of five."
1,The Ronneted,When is the rest of my ordercoming?? I ordered the Ronnetes in May and you still have not even shipped it!!!
3,Would be a great product if it wasn't so flimsy,"I bought this adapter about three weeks ago.Last weekend when I moved my laptop, the flip up piece broke off.I really didn't put much pressure on it, so I would recomend staying away from this model.Get one that doesn't have flip up parts."
1,Beyond stupid,"OK. So I'm stupid for having bought this thing in the first place but a stupider design I can't imagine. I guess I assumed, when I saw the cover on the USB gadget that they actually had a plug you could insert the cable into. However, it stays ""attached"" by way of the little plastic cover that comes off at the slightest provocation - like, say moving your DVR back into place or the cable moving...at all. I contemplated duct-taping everything together but instead, chose to return it. Don't BUY THIS DESIGN....any model. Linksys, get a different design."
5,Just as good as new.,"This is an old, old routine which is just as funny now as it was when it was first recorded."
1,letdown,"there are some good scenes in this, the space battle, the fight of luke and vader but the ewoks ruin the whole thing as well as the kid friendly vibe of it, and harrison ford seemed very bored and glad it was over, and the good guys won that stinks"
1,Return of the Lucasfilm Garbage,"I've never seen a filmmaker do so much to ruin his own legacy as the ""great"" George Lucas.By refusing to give us fans at least a decent-quality copy of the original film with this release, he's slapping us in the face once more.It's pretty ironic that the man who came up with all these primo video and audio and special effects standards (THX, ILM) can't even issue an anamorphic widescreen version of the original Star Wars trilogy.Lucas, you should be ashamed that you're the first director in history that's gone out of his way to make a DVD look BAD!"
5,Best Movie Series EVER made!!!,"This Movie specifiaclly was the best out of all six! This series is (in my opinion) so great because it is so unexpectant. But this movie series is also DEFINETLY not for young children. Some of the reasons I LOVE it are it is so sad, charming, romantic, exciting, and dramtic! It is the BEST movie in the universe for adventure-lovers!May the force be with you."
2,Weakly written and a bit gag-inducing.,"I dunno, the new Star Wars series (Episodes I and II) have been getting a lot of flack, not all of it undeserved. Oddly enough, the big problem the new series is suffering from is that most of the material in-between the high-energy, effects-laden action sequences drags, and drags pretty badly. That's a flaw the original series didn't suffer from, at least not until Return of the Jedi, which is (tied with Ep. 1) my least favorite of the entire series. It's not as enjoyable as the other parts, lacks the sense of freshness, but does admittedly have some thrilling action sequences, particularly the three-way battle, which is still marred quite a bit by the Ewoks annoying interference, easily the lowpoint of Star Wars canon period."
1,Hope the quality is better than the 2004 trilogy release.,I brought the 2004 release and the quality was not up to par. Lightsabers changing colors and you can see boxes around the fighter ships along with other problems like sound quality. I hope they fixed the problems and stop selling trash. I love the films just make the quality better its DVD not VHS. I'll probably just wait until lucas remakes the films and get those DVDs.
3,"The Weakest of the Original Three, but Still Better than What Followed","This was the weakest of the ""Star Wars"" films until the wretched prequel trilogy came along; in the light of those train wrecks, ""Return of the Jedi"" looks like a masterpiece. Sure, the plot is pretty darn similar to ""A New Hope"" (another Death Star? Really? How fast can the Empire crank these things out?), and sure, the fuzzy Ewoks make me think Lucas just threw them in so he could hawk dolls to kids at Christmas. But at least we've still got Darth Vader (and James Earl Jones' awesome voice). We've got Billy Dee Williams' charm and Mark Hamill's aw-shucks demeanor - though I admit Carrie Fisher's metal bikini kind of makes me cringe (ouch! - that thing can't be comfortable). Most importantly, though, this flick still has Harrison Ford as Han Solo, a character who consistently wound up with all of the humor and humanity that was so obviously absent from the god-awful prequel trilogy."
5,Wow! The original trilogy comes home to DVD finally!,"This is really good that the original trilogy without all of the added features that I remember it back in 1983 when The Return of the Jedi came out, is finally in DVD format. It took George Lucas and his crew to get it out on DVD. But once it was out, I was surprised to see it on DVD and have looked at it several times. I already have the 2004 version of all 3 movies when they came out on DVD 2 years ago. There is one drawback though, that I wished that George Lucas had the original trilogy sold without the 2004 version. It would have made it a better package for those of us who are really diehard Star Wars fans.All in all, this is worth getting and having as a collector's item, along with the original VHS versions of 1977, 1980 and 1983...without the added scenes or extras that the 1997 and 2004 versions have. This is the way I remember it back in 1977, 1980 and 1983 when they came out in the theaters."
5,The Original,"I love owning the original release on DVD, even if it is not quite up to the quality standards of today.I'm barely disappointed that it's on disk 2... who cares what the title is? It exists, and that's what matters.I'm only sorry that I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD when it was only available as the Special Edition. What a waste. This version is the original gem, a masterwork of plot, character, a different universe, and the over-arching good vs. evil in all of us."
3,The weakest of the original trilogy,"I loooove the original trilogy, but at this point, it seemed to me that Lucas was tired with the whole story and just wanted to wrap things up. The actors seemed similarly bored, execept for Billy Dee Williams, who I guess was real happy to have a job. Vader's ""redemption"", Luke/Leia's sibling bond, Han/Leia's romance all seemed a bit forced and half hearted. And of course, the Ewoks didn't help. However, if you're gonna get Jedi (which you should) get the original video releases if you can. The special edition's extended sequences only make the movie harder to watch."
5,Awesome Movie,"I liked how in the end the good side prevailed. I thought I wouldn't see that in this movie, but it finally showed near the end. A must see for the Star Wars Fanatic."
1,Wish I Could Choose Zero Stars!!,"Non-Anamorphic Widescreen?I think I'll just watch my old VHS tapes. What's the point of a DVD release that ignores the technical specs of the format? We're not talking about cleaning up or restoring the print itself, just formatting the DVD image for today's televisions. Inexcusable!"
4,great book,"I am a high school art teacher and teach four periods of animation each day. This book is very good, however, both of the copies I got began to fall apart after one day of being out in the classroom. If it was available in hard cover I would buy a classroom set."
5,Give the movie a chance....,"Firestarter 2 is an entertaining movie. Although it does not live up to the expectations of Stephen King fans, you must remember that Stephen King had nothing to do with the movie...Charlie is a grown up now and we should expect her to do grown up things, not just run and cry when life doesn't go her way. The characterization is great. The first part of the movie, she is working in a library and goes to clubs to find male companionship with no strings attatched. What would you expect from someone who has lost everyone she loves and fears loving anyone else for the risk that she may lose them. I am giving this five stars because the other critics are far too harsh. It is a fun movie that the sci-fi channel did a good job with. Rent it first if you like, but I'm sure you will want to add it to your DVD collection."
4,Pfaltzgraff,They have a large selection of patterns to choose from to please anyone. They do seem too chip easier than I thought they would though. Do not buy if you have smaller children because they do break.
3,Exactly what I expected,"Being a fan of the movies, I knew this book existed. It wasn't until an office conversation came up about the movie did I decide to look for this book. It's essentially a script for the movie, so don't think you're going to get anything extra out of the book. There are some twists and turns obviously, but, nothing to write home about.If you're a fan of the movie or a giant geek like I am then you'll like this edition. It adds to the experience of the movie, and there are a few talking points through out the book that would spark a nerd conversation with other dorks.Pick it up. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews I read here but after watching the movie I was very disappointed.one of the things I didn't like was how the main villain would roll around and strike poses before and during battle (the guy would actually role around in the dirt just to strike a pose, then get back up and strike another pose). in a lot of the fight scenes the moves just seemed impractical and silly to be honest. the acting and kung fu performed by the main character and his rival classmate was just plain terrible and the plot was nothing new. just wasn't very interesting imo.I wouldn't recommend this movie and doubt I'll ever watch it again. that's just my opinion though, seems a lot of others enjoyed it."
5,Best griddle ever..,"The Scanpan griddle is just as wonderful as the Scanpan skillet we own. Truly non-stick, eco-friendly, without any of the worrisome and/or delicate coatings like most other nonstick cookware. I expect we'll buy more Scanpan in future!"
5,Great book for laughing while doing math,"We like reading about swimming, there are not too many swimming books and the story makes the math practical and fun,"
5,Great Singing Voice,"I heard this many times on the radio, and when I heard this I was amazed by it. A 1000 Miles is a great song I didn't know she was a teenager I will buy this for a viewer asking when it comes out April 30th so I will buy this CD. So go buy this on 4/30/02!"
1,Last only a few years,"It worked great at the beginning and then totally lost nonstick surface after a few years usage. From other reviews, I won't bother to check warranty."
3,Decent Pots & Pans,"We've owned a set of these since 2003. They work great when new, but the pots began to pit and gouge over time. We use them frequently -- mostly hand wash and use wood & plastic utensils when cooking. The pans lost much of their anti-stick ability.The good news... I returned them to the distributor (Metro Kitchen), and they replaced them within a week -- just got them back today. No questions asked! Great customer service! Maybe the new ones have been improved and will last a little longer.We also just bought a set of the Platinum Cookware, and these are some high-quality and heavy-duty products. Just started using them, and they work nicely. They came with a video on how to fully utilize them."
1,NO Warranty at all....total lie,"I bought these pans basically for the warranty, as I was tired of replacing my coated cookware and figured that if they stood behind it for life then it must be better than the rest. Ha! They began to wear out and stick eventually just like every other brand I have used. We were so careful to care for them properly. I always hand washed and dried them, never used harsh cleaners or metal utensils. Yeah whatever. When I contacted the company, I got a run-around. It basically ended that they wouldn't even return my calls or emails at all. I was stuck. What a total lie and scam. And these pans are EXPENSIVE. Its not like I am asking them to stand behind a $20 pan. We bought a whole set for hundreds of dollars! SCANPAN, YOU SUCK!"
2,nonstick pan is not so non stick,this pan needs oil put on it and wiped out with paper towels or foods especially eggs will stick.
5,love these!,"we hurried up and bought the last 2 of these that we needed, as i quickly found out after changing all but 3 of our levers in the house, that the delta series was ending production. i went to both home depot and lowes - where i'd purchased all the others - and they both said they were a non-order/non-restock item, so they wouldn't be getting anymore in. thank goodness for amazon b/c i would've been pissed had i had all but 3 levers changed and couldn't find the last three i needed. problem averted - thanks amazon!"
4,Decent,"I must admit GP&TN's first album was dull, the second a vast improvement over that one, but this one I think is the best of her efforts. This music is very similar to the music of Sheryl Crow and Jewel. Not really breaking new ground here, but I imagine GP&TN will be around for a long time and have many more opportunities to wow their fans. A good effort."
3,Go see them live.,Every one of her albums is better but this is a young band and getting better all the time.If you go see them perform this same material live I think you will be suprised at how much better her singing is and how much more punch and character the songs here are.I really feel like they maybe need to take another year and then go back and do a live album that has most of the songs on her previous albums because I don't think the albums do them justice. The production is not so hot and the band and Grace are way more polished now.I think she's in her 20's and most of the band is young. If they keep improving like they have she will end up being one of the top 10 female rockers of all time.
4,Decent,"These guys are great live, but neither this album nor their previous one captures the energy as well. Personally, I like the upbeat songs more than the slow songs, and the middle chunk of this album is all slow songs. However, the upbeat songs are decent. They definately are polished and sound like ""mainstream rock,"" kind of like Sheryl Crowe, Melissa Ethridge, that type of thing (rockin musicians, to be sure). If you like GP&N, you'll want this album. I like listening to it, but mostly because I can supplement it with my memories of their live shows."
3,Very Heavy,"Its OK , but its very heavy . I gave it to a friend who seemed to like it more than I did. I wouldn't buy it again but my friend loves it so I guess its a matter of opinion , what you like and your own taste."
3,Okay read for a North Carolina native,"I went to UNC-CH & grew up near where the author grew up, so the book was interesting to me. I imagine it may be less interesting for others. I enjoyed learning the history of UNC basketball the most."
4,Pretty design,"The other reviewer said it was very cheap. I've seen thinner flags, and for the price I think it's about right. I really like the design and it is very clear to see. I think it's a good Easter flag, and they are hard to find. Wouldn't give it 5 stars b/c it is a little thin, but you get what you pay for."
3,"Very informative, with an Army perspective","An excellent, very detailed history of the Southwestern Oklahoma frontier, the conflicts with the Comanches and Kiowas, and this important military post. As should be expected given Colonel Nye's background and the focus of the book, it is written from a military perspective. The book contains a wealth of information and is well worth reading by those interested in its subject matter. Other accounts of the wars and the reasons for the clash of cultures on the Southwestern Frontier after the Civil War may be found in Comanches: The Destruction of a People by Fehrenbach and The Buffalo War by Haley; or a later compilation by Nye of the tales told him by the Kiowas, entitled Bad Medicine and Good."
3,Watch out for sharp edges!!!!!,"Got two ""nice"" cuts the first time I took hold of it.Had to file them down which was very easy-since I have a file.I think the vinal or rubber coated is better.This is painted metal.Hope it does not rust!!??"
3,2nd edition is published,"2nd Edition is published around Aug 05, I mistakenly ordered this book from Amazon and thought this is the latest edition. I have to return this book as a result.Amazon should sell the latest edition."
5,GREAT MEMORIES,"I'll probably be considered biased because the lead singer of the Gears, Axxel G. Reese is my big brother but I love this CD. It's been a while since I listened to it but, when I came across the CD on this web-site, I listened to the tracks again and remembered why I loved them so much. My favorites are ""Baby Run Around"" and ""Heartbeat Baby"". All the tracks on the CD have great energy and the lyrics range from harsh, ""Baby Run Around don't come home at night no more...."" to fun and carefree, ""Grab a girl, go for a whirl, head on down to the beach"".As a teenager, I used to go see my brother perform at clubs like The Troubador and The Whisky and it was always such a thrill to see him up on stage. It still is! I love watching the audience's reaction to his music. I've seen my brother perform live many times with The Gears and with his other bands and he always brings so much energy and excitement to the music. The Gears captured that same energy on this CD."
4,"""MEMORIES"" ""ROCKIN' AT GROUND ZERO""","Back in the early 80's Hardcore Punk Exploded in LA.. bands like X, Black Flag, Circle Jerks,Social Distortion,T.S.O.L Just to Name a few... But This Album was well like'd back in the day and it still is! I was a singer from a band calledTMA(Debate Album)What's for Dinner? and I was Visiting my friend in Southern California.Huntington,Beach.I was clubing around town and ran into Axxel along with Mike Ness (SD). Axxel asked Me if he could Have a Copy of our album in exchange for His,I said,that sounds like a fair Exchange to me...he signed his and I signed Mine...what a Deal...It would be Nice To Talk To Axxel again..Rockin'Good Album..Love it..Cheers.""Dave of our Live's"""
3,It's not a Movie,"Beryl is perfect. You collect all the swells, all the gentlemen, all those perfect graduates of all the right schools that at the end of the Edwardian Era believe themselves to be the best of the best. You add to that roster all the blatant goldiggers, the social parentheticals and all those female trollers in whom their mothers had all the best hopes. You put them all on a ship bound into the winter North Atlantic; and in just one Neptunian inhalation you sink the boat.Never in the history of biology has fate and genetics so conspired to remove from our presence such a conceited and disgusting group. Beryl wrote this book with a sigh of relief and a chuckle; you should chuckle too. We are all better for the story and the biology."
3,not a power house,"You get what you pay for. I use it in my truck when i don,t want to put on my bright dome lights..not very bright but it is what it is.."
5,Phil Spector Producer of the 60's,"Though he has fallen in the years, Phil Spector was a genius in producing hit music in the 60's. Back to Mono (1958-1969) is a great example of his work. Especially when he could convince DJs across America that a record that was stamped with a time of 3:05 was really close to 3:46 minutes. And that record was You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling by the Righteous Brothers. Impressive. The whole set is great."
2,$15 is about right,"I have no idea whether Mr. Spector is guilty of the serious charges against him, but he stands convicted of allowing his retrospective box to be released with some of the muddiest, dullest mastering in memory. Sound-wise, a total mess. Of course, many of the tracks are indispensable."

1,Buyer Beware,"I saw this router recently at a local computer store and was excited to find a device that would enable VPN connections. So, I bought the Linksys BEFVP41 EtherFast Cable/DSL VPN Router w/4 port Switchrouters and brought it home in anticipation of a faster connection and establish a VPN connection to my office. Disappointment followed, after four hours of struggling with the installation, which included loading the latest software within the router, I called the help desk. I was informed by the help desk that the reason I was unable to make configuration changes to the router was due to a software defect within the device. I exchanged the device for another one. This one had the exact same issue. I exchanged the router for a flat screen and more basic router that I am pleased with."
2,Ill-trained tech support.,"You better not rely on Linksys tech support for any expert knowledge and help.They follow certain standard scripts and if things get a bit complex they are essentially lost. And so are you.They'll make you work with their ""reset and re-flash"" routine wasting your time, when problems lie elsewhere.I bought two units but when one acted strangely and then failed a lot of wasted time was spent on the phone doing irrelevant things and often getting wrong information.When the units work it was great. Buy the units if you are confident that your prayers will be answered that you'll never encounter a defective unit. Or if you enjoy spending a lot of time on the phone with ill-trained technicians."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","This book is a translation of the original done is spanish (though much better organized, written and with a higher quality binding/printing job). It holds good information about the stories and the basics about the Santeria/Lucumi branch of the African religion of Ocha. It also goes into description about the particular ceremonies that are not always accurate or are missing information. This may be because these ceremonies are not meant to be published for the public and are only meant to be preformed by initiated/experienced priests. I'm not sure I can not clearly recommend this book as I feel some of the information should not be published at all, so it barely gets into the 3 star range."
4,Good Read,I originally ordered this for my son and he couldn't put it down. After he was finished with it I read the book and it is a interesting story. I would recommend this as something to pass the time.
5,Astor does it again!,"Like in his book about Okinawa, Operation Iceburg, Gerald Astor has written another oral biography of a major WWII battle. This time, the Battle of the Bulge. And like Operation Iceburg, this book is terrific. It is really like being there. Astor has allowed the veterans to tell their own story and in doing so one clearly sees the importance of what our young men did in the 1940s to save the world from the Nazis. Read this book and thank a WWII veteran."
2,Dull supper club orchestra music a la Sam Cooke,"I love Sam Cooke and I am a great fan of soul music. However, the entire CD is totally boring. Don't trust the reviews. Listen to the samples. If you like the samples get the CD as the sound is great. But, to my ears, this is a dull uninspired performance of poorly chosen songs with a really boring orchestra. One review claims the CD has a mono sound to it-- I played it as a SACD and it is definitely stereo--- nicely recorded and nicely mastered but boring."
4,Clear and doable program for back pain,"This book was recommended to me by my physical therapist. It is clear and easy to follow, but one must do exactly as it prescribes. It is an every day program, but can, at first increase back pain as it involves the surrounding muscle groups. Taking a day off every once in a while is a good idea if you are elderly (I'm 69)."
3,It's okay...,"Honestly, going to a chiropractor, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or just talking to your general practitioner can give you the same info that is in this book."
2,Works only if your spine is stiff and the low back curve is flat,This is suitable for healthy and athletic type younger people. Be careful if you have DDD (degenerated disc of the lumbar) or arthritis. This may give relief for couple of day but the pain comes back! The tension pose (equivalent of bending back) actually increased my pain after 2 weeks.
5,It really works!,"Three months ago I developed a bulging disc in my back. The pain was in my back and radiated down my right leg. The pain during standing, sitting, and during exercise was excruciating. I could not even stand for more than one minute. I tried going to a chiropractor, orthopedic doctor, physical therapy, and prescription medication. I paid over $1,000 in insurance co-payments. After all that the pain was still there. A friend told me about this book. I have been doing the exercises exactly as it says to in the book for a week now. I have virtually no pain. Even when I do have pain it is much more mild and it is manageable. I stopped taking the prescription medications. I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering from pain like I described. It really works."
4,Compatible with DLO iPod mic,"I only bought this lapel mic hoping that it can do a better job recording than the lapel mic that came with the DLO iPod mic. This lapel mic did it's job and is compatible with DLO's mic. I read reviews about Griffin's iTalk and how the design flaw prevents the iPod user from lock/unlocking their iPod. And the issue with freezing didn't sit well with me. So, I went with DLO's mic that works pretty well without the lapel mic. But when you attach Griffin's lapel mic, my iPod can finally do it's job."
2,Doesn't work with iPod Touch,"While this microphone works fine for several purposes, don't buy it for an iPod Touch. It is not a stand alone mic for use with the iPod Touch and the iTalk app. You will need other accessories to make it work. The product description could have been more specific."
3,more information would have been nice!,"I purchased this for a gift, and we haven't really been able to try it out yet because the material did not clearly explain that you needed an additional component to make it work on an iPhone/iPod. It should clearly state that you need to get an iTalk or some other component to make this work."
2,The final product is great... if you ever get there,"This software would be a great deal if it was for the following. 1) Extremely buggy, even after installing the 10.5 patch, the software constantly crashes. 2) All the ""cool effects"" it claims to offer, you have to purchase the key for, that will set you back at least another $99 per key. 3) Did I mention the program is buggy?They did improve on the fact that in previous versions (I don't know about 9, just 8) when the program crashes (not if, but when) you lose all the unsaved work that you just spent the last hour working on, but not in this version.But I will give it this. I persisted through the crashes and weird bugs that crept up, and the final product was loved by many, including myself. That's why it got 2 stars instead of 1..."
1,Putrid Studio 10,"Wow. I have never seen a set of Amazon reviews which ALL gave a product one-star. Incredible. I'm running a 3.7G processor, 2Gb or RAM, a 10,000RPM C: drive. The software is slow and buggy. I've lost countless hours of my time using this putrid piece of excrement. If I were the software developers of this product I would plan on looking for alternate employment 'cause they're not very good at their day job.I have had some good experiences with this software, however:1. I can use the box to store old bills2. The CD makes a great coaster3. I wrapped a peanut butter sandwich in the shrink wrap; kept it fresh4. I put the manual under the wobbly leg of my kitchen table; that made it sturdy right awaySo, if you need to do any of these four things then purchase this software. However, if you need to do video editing run away from this product FAST."
1,Stay away,The other people are telling the truth. A world of bugs awaits you.The only reason I wrote this was to see why this averages one star. The reason is that you can't give zero
1,Unusable,"The product takes forever to launch, I mean the longest I have ever waited for anything. When it eventually loads I can't even watch any video, much less get to a point where I can edit it. The preview window doesnt work at all, the first frame of the scene just sits there motionless, although sometimes I can hear sound. I bought this specifically to edit my mpeg4 video from my digital camera, because thats what they advertises it can do, but the files will not open from the file location, nor be captured from the camera. Can't import them at all. I thought studio 9 was pretty good even though they had some negative reviews, I figured those reviews from people who were just natural born complainers. That said, this product is horrible. Don't waste your money! How can they sell this garbage? Can anyone recommend any software for editing with mpeg4?"
1,"If you bought Studio 10/10+, try this instead","If you are considering dumping Pinnacle Studio for something that works as advertised, consider this product instead. I have had great success with it and it NEVER crashes.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AP2X0U/qid=1131803716/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8__i1_xgl65/104-8898794-6164743?v=glance&s;=software&n;=541966"
1,Has anyone performed testing on this product,"I've installed the product on brand new Dell Dimension 9100 running Windows XP, 1GB memory, 160GB Hard Drive, 3GHz Pentium 4 processor.Software installation went fine. When I opened Studio 10 it disappeared from screen after just a few seconds. Whenever I tried to open it I would get a message that the software shut down previously and I get 3 choices - New project / Open existing project / Continue. No matter what option I select the software just disappears in a few seconds. I tried, of corse reinstalling the software with the same luck.I am sure it is a great software full of features...if I was able to open it."
1,Crash and burn!,"I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., this one, and a later version. And they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. Studio Plus v10.0 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."
1,Not to beat a dead horse,"Not to beat a dead horse, but I hate this product too for all the reasons already stated."
4,The Past Casts a Mighty Shadow,"Have you ever met someone and felt that you've known each other for a long time? That's how I felt about Kitty (this book's heroine). And like Kitty, I fell in love with Virgil and her quirky father. Just like Kitty, there is something mysterious about Virgil that I can't put my finger on. He's got a looming past in Romania, and Kitty has her dysfuntional family to deal with.Anyway, at times this book will jerk a tear, or erupt a laugh. I enjoyed my time with Virgil and wish it could have gone on another 200 pages!"
4,Did the trick for me,"I recently purchased my second container of this. It has done well to keep spiders away from our house and out of the garage. The last 3 month claim seems about right. I'm sure it varies on conditions. I reapply when I start to see spiders again, and it's not too often. I also put some in an expansion crack in the driveway. I'm not sure if this helps or not, but I figure it couldn't hurt."
3,Okay...,Not a bad book but too many cliches in it for my taste. It held my attention and went by pretty quick.
3,I was kind of disappointed,"I didn't care for Daphne Matthew's character in this book. It's one thing to be independent, but when you make stupid decisions regarding your life and profession, independence counts for nothing. She put her life in jeapordy more than once because she wanted to show she's able-bodied and independent and she can do her job. It made her come off as naive and downright stupid to me.The overall storyline was creative and it did keep me guessing but I could have done without Matthew's characterization. She put me in mind of Patricia Cornwell's Dr. Kay Scarpetta, doing stupid things to show how independent and strong they are."
1,How did this get into print?,"What a unintelligent shallow story. You got a lame incompetent female police forensic psychologist and a superduper perfect cop doing/being stupid. That's it. My first R.Pearson, my last."
5,class with a capital C,"I first heard Raul Malo's singing on the Gram Parsons Grievous Angel tribute. To say Raul Malo has a voice blessed by angels is hardly an overstatement. On 'After Hours' you'll find many a familar tune paid due respect by this gifted vocalist. Sincere adaptions one and all. Anytime, anywhere, it just has to be good listening. Enjoy."
3,Good more soft than metal,"Good but could be so much better symphonic style with no symphony very little expression of fear or trepidation, its mostly sorrow maybe this cd will grow on me or not"
4,Great way better than an Ipod,"THis Mp3 player can hold up to 110 songs depending on how many megabites your songs are. The screen is big and lights up blue with option to keep it on for 3,5,10,35,45,60 seconds or have it always on. Another great thing about this Mp3 player is that it takes triple A batteries meanwhile AN iPOD probably takes cell batteries with are expensive and hard to find. THis Mp3 player has very good sound and feels like your listening to the song at a concert. :) :) :)"
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this player reading the reviews in this site. But I relized they were wrong. This player sucks. It does not play some of the audio files, you have to have a cable to connect to the computer. And compated to Creative Muvo, it is very big too. I would recommend a ""Do not buy""."
5,super easy,i have had this mp3 player for about a weak and a half and it works awsome. the ear buds it comes with are super clear. better than my ipod ones.it is supereasy to put songs on it.(as long as you have windows media player)you just plug it in using the usb cord and drag and drop the songs into the folder.i would recamend this for all ages that can understand how to read and use a computer.
4,Great for the money,I bought this for my 6 year old son. He has no problems using it and loves it. I was able to add MP3s and playlists to with no problem using Windows Media Player.
4,Excellent,"I order this product for my 10 year old daugher for her birthday. It was very easy to download music on to, and she loves it. This is a great product."
4,very good value for the money,"It's not the latest or the greatest, but considering the price at which these MP3 players can be had these days, you can't go wrong.I got one for each of my children [9 & 12] and they are delighted. In fact, I got one for myself for my short 15-minute walk to work. While the sound quality is not very good [I admittedly went for quantity of songs over quality], those who are not hardcore audiophiles will be hard-pressed to find fault."
4,Good for the money,This little mp3 player is good for the money. It hods up well to travel and the battery really lasts. Good for a first mp3 player.
4,Great value,Only downfall is that the battery seems to drain pretty fast. Find it to be a great value and excellent MP3 player for the price. I had bought the same model through Circuit City prior to finding it on Amazon and can confirm that Amazon has the much better deal. Great sound and easy to use.
1,Audible Users Beware,"I purchased this player to listen to Audible Books. Audible lists this player on their site and it came from SanDisk bundled with information about Audible Books. You would think that it would be suitable for listening to Audible Books. BEWARE! I used it in my car and stopped and started the player as I ran errands. Most of the time when restarted it jumped ahead about 4 minutes and I had to rewind and try to find my place. I contacted SanDisk Support and they told me that it was a ""limitation"" on the player due to buffering. I told them that any consumer would consider it a defect and would never purchase it for this use if they were aware of this ""limitation"". I asked that they provide me a player that was suitable for this use. They never replied to this request. I would avoid SanDisk products as they misrepresented this player and do not stand behind their products."
4,"Good product, great price!",Having this cute & amazing device has changed my outdoor life...I can listen to music and I love it! Have had no problems what so ever and really enjoy the SanDisk Sansa M230....worth the small price. It's a good starter mp3 player and SUPER easy to use!
3,still not sure,not sure if I like this item or not.....I bought it for my dad but havent been able to give it to him because I cant get any songs to download to it...
3,Good but with a caveat,"This product works. It has a good sound, easy set up and is easy to use. But to start the process of using it, your computer must be windows Vista, or XP. You can not set it up on Windows seven. I don't know if there are drivers for the Sansa e100 for Windows seven. Good Luck!"
1,Awful,"I found this product very difficult to use. Despite reading the instructions (over and over), I was unable to load my mp3 files onto this device. The instructions were way too sparse--I know this is an unusual complaint. When I called consumer assistance in order to assist me, they were unable to understand why the files could not be successfully transferred. All in all, I wasted about 4 to five hours trying to figure out how to use this device with no success. I returned it the next day."
1,Do not buy a SanDisk Sansa MP3 Player,Do not buy a SanDisk Sansa MP3 Player. The volume control button stopped working after we had it for 1 month. I am returning it for a refund.
5,Great MP3!,"I bought this little MP3 player for my young daughter. I didn't see spending the money on a children's model when she would outgrow it in a year or two. I was worried that she wouldn't be able to work it, but it is really simple to operate. It has really good battery life. She loves taking it with her everywhere."
5,Great Product,I bought the SanDisk Sansa M230 512MB for myself. I was not sure if I would like it but did not want to spend the money for an I-POD. I love it! It is easy to load songs and the sound is great. The battery lasts pretty long and the price is right. I enjoyed it so much that I bought my mom and brother one for their birthdays.
5,Awesome,"I bought this mp3 player about 6 years ago and even with continious use it still works like new. the case that came with it is winderful i attatch it to my belt and off i go my only qualm about this mp3 player is the screen, a while back i somehow crushed it and now the screen dosent work this is however my fault and the player continues to work like a dream however no replacement screen is available."
4,A nice mp3 player for the money,"This is really the first mp3 player I have owned. I initially looked at the IPOD's but was turned away from the price and also the fact that I had to purchase the songs from Itunes. This player is simple to use, sounds really good, is very small and lightweight, and is a good deal for the money.If you want to store 1000 songs, or watch videos, then this is not the player for you. If you want something that's easy to afford, and can store around 200 songs, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this one.I rated only 4 stars, as you may want to consider the 1G player as it would hold somewhere around 400 songs."
5,Great Starter MP3 Player,I purchased this at Best Buy. It's fantastic and runs for days on one triple A battery. Also the FM Radio feature is a bonus. The display is also a plus that the ipod shuffle doesn't have.
1,I regret buying this item,I bought this product last year march for myself and one for my sister in May and i gave it good review because it work fine for a few months and before for the year was out both of them stop working. It would not turn on no more both of them it would say initializing and then nothing would happen. If i had waited then i would not have bought the second one never again now i have to go buy another one again. I wasted my money.
3,M230 512 MB MP3 Player,"Reasonable price, nice display complete music storage and listening device with a few disappointments. It is not easy to learn to use. Booklet is brief and does not describe exactly how to put music on the device. It only plays MP3, WMA and MIDI files and will not play an Audio CD file. Such files must be converted. Organization of files on the device is confusing. However, once files are on it, it finds and plays them nicely. One can select a specific artist or album. If I were 12 instead of six times that I surely would have had this thing figured out by now."
2,sandisk sansa m230 512 mb mp3 player(blue),it looks nice but i can't use it because the company never sent me a disc to set it up.
4,SanDisk Sansa-nice deal for the money!,"An mp3 player that is inexpensive, and easy to use. I also bought the protective case that has a belt clip so that I don't have to hold it all the time. A little bulky for aerobic activities such as running, but the sizable navigation buttons are great! Battery cover seems to slip around a little when it's not in the case. Battery life is pretty good. I would highly recommend this product to someone as an entry level player or for anyone who has problems with the small navigation buttons on most other mp3 players."
2,The sound is great. But loading music is a pain.,My husband gave me the Sandisk Sansa for Christmas.I was so happy to get it due to my other MP3 player went missing.Down loading music from the computer has been very hard. Out of 80 songs it only accepted 40 of them.There are some songs on my player that I want to delete but the system will not let me delete them. Think twice before buying this system.
1,SanDisk Error,"This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company."
1,Broke after 2 months,Broke after 2 months of use. froze up. Called customer service. Was no help. poor quality. can hardly see screen. would never purchase sandisk again.
3,Pretty good for the price,"It was an ok purchase. I was hoping for much clearer recording capabilities, but they are not great.Has a good sound. I still can't figure out how to stop it from always starting a song where i left off instead of letting me go pick which song to start with..."
2,Good while it last,I have both of these items for a few years and don't use them anymore. The skillet is not non-stick anymore and the dutch oven is flaking. So for a price of the set and a couple of years of use I don't think it's a good deal.
1,"WON'T TAKE A LICKING, AND SOON STARTS STICKING.","Like many other reviewers for Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again. SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, THINK TWICE."
5,As addictive as the last,"I have been listening to this CD for alomst 8 weeks now and I have to say I love it. It is currently the soundtrack to my life and each time I hear a song again, I find a different lyric to relate to or beat to rock out to. There is not a bad song on the cd, but the clear favourites are ""The Pursuit"", ""Q"", ""Kiss the Flag"" (Brilliant lyrics - god's not alone anymore!) and ""Painted"". I was also fortunate enough to purchase the CD with the bonus DVD, making my appreciation for the Evan's Blue message so much greater. The CD will grow on you, just like the first!"
4,snapshot in time,"being a fan of the ""wall of sound"" Mr. Spector is know for, this CD is about what i expected, of course the popular resurgence of ""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" by Darlene Love on the Letterman Show is what drove me to purchase, and i can say i've enjoyed the CD as for what it is a ""snapshot in time"""
2,overproduced,"I can see that if you grew up listening to this album/CD how you might have some nostalgiac recollection of the holiday season and thereby relate to that innocent time in your life when any break from a choral representation of holiday standards was ground-breaking. However, with all the Christmas collections out there today, this CD is starting to show its age. The arrangements now sound stale. The vocals are muddy, often being drowned out or at least blunted by the layers of sound over, under, and around them. The songs themselves can be found on other CD's in much better, more lively versions.Try Ella Fitzgerald's Collection or Sinatra's collection for starters before you try this.Don't give in to the hype like I did and you will have a much happier Christmas."
4,Good Strong Magnets,"They are smaller than I expected so that is why I didn't give them 5 stars, but they are very strong and the clips work fine."
5,Great clips!,These are great little clips. The magnet is very strong and can hold a surprising amount of weight! Highly recommend them!
4,Non-Fiction,"A pretty useful reference, giving basic career information for players who had appeared in the VFL/AFL up to the time of publication.More space of course is devoted to the more important, better and influential players.A valuable reference for those involved in the game, or fans with more than an a passing research interest in general."
4,VERY RELAXING-MOTIVATIONAL,"Great workout and excercise, increases spirit. It moves a little fast and might not be suitable for beginners, but overall excellent."
4,Instructive and relaxing.,"Having practiced yoga and meditation for over thirty years, I highly recommend this video. While it often takes months or years to learn the proper yoga postures, this is still helpful to show a few advanced postures. While watching these performers, I become relaxed enough to ""space out,"" and in this day and age, anything that helps people deal with life's uncertainties is worthwhile. But let the beginner beware . . . the advanced postures need to be approached systematically and with care.(Bonnie Turner, author of THE HAUNTED IGLOO)"
2,Absolutely NOT for beginners...,"I was looking for a beginners video to ""get my feet wet"" in yoga. While I think this is a beautiful video and very useful to those already practicing yoga, it is definately not for beginners. The poses are impossible which is quite frustrating. There are no beginner variations for these poses either. It wasn't until I bought another video that I learned about ""blocks"". Had this video included this information it would have been slightly easier. I suggest purchasing a BEGINNER video and using the Yoga Mind & Body video as something to work up to. As I said before, it is a beautiful video and once I work my way up to it I am sure I will enjoy it. The scenery is wonderful, the voices are soft and calming, and there are men and women in the video, but those poses are impossible for a beginner. I hope this helps."
2,"Pretty, but....","The scenery in this tape is gorgeous (but on the other hand, who really concentrates on the TV screen during yoga practice?). During this yoga session, Erich Schiffman places emphasis on the emotions that accompany the physical sensation of yoga; the effect is wonderful. The downside, though, is that many important physical cues necessary to start your yoga practice off moving correctly and to get the most out of it are missing. It's too hard for beginners and missing too many elements (like sun salutes - they're on there, but far too modified) for more advanced practicioners."
5,One of the best produced yoga videos,"I really don't have a lot to add to the rest of the 164 reviews but this is really a beautiful yoga workout, good music , relaxing, just a little bit challenging . Not for complete beginners. 56 minutes.The DVD has a menu with chapter selection of every sequence of poses : sun salutations, standing, etc."
4,"Vivid, accessible overview of the latest theories ...","A clear, eloquent, and graceful discussion of how recent scientifc discoveries impact our lives in more than just theoretical terms. Thuan begins with a wonderfully vivid, accessible overview of the latest theories about chaos, gravity, strange attractors, fractals, symmetry, superstrings, and the strangeness of atoms, and reveals how these discoveries have shaped our view of the universe. From the subatomic world to the vastness of quasars and galaxies, from the nature of mathematics to the fractal characteristics of the human circulatory system, Trinh Xuan Thuan takes us on a truly awe-inspiring tour of the universe as we know it today. With brilliant analogies that open up the strangest, often counterintuitive theories about all sorts of things most of us don't take the time to consider, what Thuan really shows readers in Chaos and Harmony is how science has actually restored mystery and amazement to the world around us."
5,excellent book,stuart woods wins again. a fascinating story. great characters. it was fun to see how some characters got started. will lee and his wife are great
5,An author of breathtaking power and beauty,"Angeles Mastretta has captivated me! Her voice is completely her own, but you will be reminded of elements of Anais Nin, D.H. Lawrence, Yukio Mishima, Gabriel Garcia Marquez - even poets like Pablo Neruda and Rainer Maria Rilke. If you like any two of these writers, I predict you will fall for her as I have. Short stories, beautifully told - stories of real women, living real lives. A book you will devour, over and over."
3,Ok!!,"Bought this for my son as a gift. When we got it i was a little disappointed in the quality, but for an eight year old it is fine."
4,Tommy & Tuppence from a non-reader's persepctive,"Enjoyed the all-too-short series... even though i've never read the Agatha Christie source material... I was warned that the primary character casting might seem incorrect to reading fans, but I fell in love with both of them. Perhaps not as elaborately staged as some of the British mystery series, an enjoyable evening spent with every episode none-the-less!"
1,DVD Sound is Terrible,"Purchased the ""Tommy & Tuppence: Set 1"" as a gift. Picture quality was wonderful on all episodes and the sound quality on ""The Secret Adversary"" was likewise. However, the sound on the shorter episodes was non-existent. I contacted Acorn Media and they said that the master from the original production was in ""mono"", therefore not of high quality. Acorn Media suggested I change the television setting from stereo to mono to improve the sound quality. It didn't. Only turning the television volume up as high as it can go, are you able to hear any dialog. However, by doing this, you also hear an irritating ""HISS"" throughout the program, which is nearly as loud as the dialog/music. Forget it.I am going to return the DVD and get the VHS, to see if it's any better.[June 1, 2006]VHS is much better. Not a VHS fan, but you gotta go where you gotta go."
5,Great Series,"Great series, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
4,Fan All Over Again,"I have to confess that after the second season when they killed off Kate, I lost interest in NCIS for a while. However, when I got Season 2 DVD and learned that Sasha Alexander wanted out, I guess I felt a little better. Now I've seen Season 3 and Season 4, and it's a whole new experience. I'm enjoying NCIS all over again. The interaction among the characters is what makes this show. Yes, the crime drama elements are there: Crime scene, forensics, and investigating, but it's so much more. You even have to like Tony, even when you want to pop him on the back of his head -- and are so glad Gibbs did."
5,"In My Opinion, The Most Entertaining NCIS Episode So Far","In My Opinion, The Most Entertaining NCIS Episode So Far. The beginning, middle and especially the end, are excellent. Also, Abby's costume is super."
5,NCIS DVD's,"Excellent, as stated, and I'm very pleased to have the set, being a Marine from the Vietnam era."
3,Por favor especifiquen si es subtitutalada en Español,"Esto me ha sucedido con todas las temporadas. Esto es una pena que no pongan desde el principio al menos subtituladas. CSI Temporada 7, esta mas que subtitulada, esta doblada en español, que dicen mis detractores?"
3,"An engrossing, but limited film","In this engrossing, thought provoking film we are left to form our own opinions. Tobias's opinions are by no means backed by the persistent directors, and so we can see them for what they are - unorthodox and to some of us not accurate. Still, there is a lot to like in this eccentric documentary. One complaint is besides the notoriety of his stay with the natives there is really nothing to document about him."
3,Okay. Not great.,"Okay. Not great. Nice feel good book, but not much in terms of practical application of psychology."
3,Lesser film still decent with Stewart in it,"Pot 'O Gold is a rather gooey film. It chronicles the progression of a relationship between characters played by Paulette Goddard and the unparalleled James Stewart. Eventually, they get the idea for a radio show that gives away a thousand dollars every week. When everybody realizes that doing this legally will be difficult, they spend a few days desperately attempting to find a solution. They do, of course, and the show is a big hit, whereupon Stewart and Goddard cement their committment to one another and the film ends. In my opinion, the only thing that one could genuinely enjoy from this film is the presence of James Stewart. Otherwise, save your money."
1,"""very best of Tchaikovsky"" is the worst.","Do not buy this edition of Tchaikovsky unless you plan to limit its use to your elevator and even then.... It sounds like it was mixed as a high school project for some AV club. Flat, colorless, no spirit. All the notes are there, but no life. I checked to see if it was a MONO recording. Find something else."
3,Hong Kong sci-fi fare...,"Not as bad as they say it is, but still far from the pinnacle of your sci-fi mysteries. The worse actor here is the rotund Wong Jing, who plays a cameo, and is both unfunny and crass. Again Andy Lau gets to play the man who can do no wrong, the heroic scientist-investigator Wesley, who is part of the UN extra-terrestial department (that's what the movie says). The film is a sort of toss-up between ""Men in Black"" and ""Terminator II""; there are good aliens (one played by Rosamund Kwan, who plays a 400-year-old blue-blooded alien) and (very) bad aliens, and there're plenty of special effects and computer morphing a la Terminator II style. The production value is admirable, but what most Western viewers won't get is the story. Shu Qi is gorgeous (as always), but even she can't give this film a 100% kudos."
2,Crochet Today? more like grandma's crochet!,"If you want to buy a crochet magazine, I'll try Interweave's Crochet. It has better more contemporary patterns, better quality pictures and more techniques you can learn. This magazine seemed second grade by comparison. I was disappointed."
5,Patterns with easy to find yarns,Good magazine so far. I am actually thinking of getting a subscription. The patterns are not so far out there like Interweave Knits and Vogue Knitting lately. The patterns seem to be for real people and have easy to find yarns. Good mix of good yarns and cheaper ones.You can go to their website and preview all patterns from that issue too.
5,Great magazine,I have ordered this magazine since it first started publication. It is a great magazine for crocheters . The patterns range from apparel to home items to infants and so on. It uses easy to find yarn and offers substitutions for different brands as well. The patterns are very well written and easy to follow. I would highly recommend it. I like the auto renewal since it makes it a lot easier to keep from missing an issue but also offers enough notice if you don't want to continue receiving it as well.
4,dak thriller,"The Killing KindA really dark thriller with Ann Southern and her motherly love for her bastard son, who hates all women other than his drunk mother, who he blames for his lost life. Cindy Williams's acting would have been almost average with wearing less clothes, delivering lines like, ""I've never done it before in a bathtub"", wow I could really feel her pain, not. And the girl next door, with the bonus of old dad in a wheelchair, what a winner, with ""You could have raped me and I would not have said anything"" sounds like the girl to marry. All in all the film was right out of the 1950's dark and sex was fobidden, like Eve's apple. I give it 4 stars, Oh MOTHER where is my beer and popcorn, Norman B."
1,"Why, oh why ...","... would anyone want to listen to this more than once? Is it the songwriting, which is beyond hokey? Is it the bland playing of the anonymous studio musicians (surely no one still believes this was a real band)?Really, some of the songs might have a certain corny charm when they happen to pop up on oldies radio (""Something Good"" comes to mind), but I find it impossible to understand that anyone would make the effort to put this on a stereo, much less actually pay for the priviliege of doing so.If there really is an interest in schlocky, borderline campy (well, not even borderline in the case of ""Henry the 8th..."") then I concede that this is a perfect album. Otherwise, save your money - better yet, complete your Beatles collection and start working on the Kinks."
2,"""A Must To Aviod"" this version","If you're looking for authenticity or the original versions, forget this album/disc/MP3s. Don't know who the singer(s) are, but definately NOT Peter Noone (original leads) in his heyday. Sorry to say, I bought the entire album, as couldn't discern the inaccuracies by just the sample. Another $4.99 wasted!!!"
3,"Great tunes, lousy mastering","This CD has 15 of the Hermits best, however the mastering of the CD itself is often muddy and sometimes distorted. You would be better off with one of the excellent sounding (and better compiled!) import cd's. And where in the world is ""Mr. Moonshine Man"" available?"
2,"Hardly sexy,hardly thrilling","Eric Roberts plays a creepy professor who sleeps with his female students--and teaches one of them,Lila,to look into the past.Lila suspects that the professor may have slain his former students to cover up his secret.Eric Roberts is supposed to be the handsome,seductive Casanova;there are plenty of gratuitous bedrooms scenes that are more laughable than steamy.It's hardly erotic;it's hardly a thriller--it probably makes ""Basic Instinct"" look like a classic.""Sensation"" would be perfect for a cult movie night.In its attempts to be an erotic thriller,it ends up being silly&just; plain BIZARRE.When will this movie get the MST3K treatment it rightfully deserves???The movie is worth seeing for its campy ""sexiness""&its; strange plot.Beyond that..."
4,An exciting movie from start to end.,This movie is so interesting. It keeps you on suspense the whole time. A good movie from the nearly past and to see the begining of Kari Wuhrer filmography.
5,Awesome,Best Bible I've ever owned !! I had one before but wanted the hard cover !! If your in recovery this is a must !!
4,Just what I have been looking for.,"I have been searching for a bible that would cover eveything that I go through as a recoverying addict and that would also explain the bible in detail to me. From what I have seen in reveiwing the sample pages, this has been an answer to my prayer."
4,A 60s Nostolgia CD,"If you had the vinyl album, you will remember that the Greatest Hits record had all of her radio hits. This is really the only collection to have since she didn't have a very long career. The CD has some added ""cuts"" to fill out the play time for CD format. Frankly, the added cuts aren't very good. Check out your old vinyl jacket cover for the origianl songs and stop the CD when you get to the last original song. Otherwise, this was a nice trip down memory lane."
5,Chalee Will Touch Your Heart if You Let Her,"This CD is an awesome collection of ballads and uptempo honky tonkers. You'll love every song, Chalee deals with her past head on in We Don't Have to Pray, and let's the listener get a peek at her heart in Somebody Save Me. But you also get to have fun with songs like I Ain't and Makin' Up with You. One of the strongest songs for this album is Go Back, a hear wrenching ballad you have to hear to feel the impact of. This is a must for any country fan. Chalee is here to stay."
5,Profound,"An excellent follow-up to the ""The Open Road"". Ababio shares his tale of trying to capture the American dream to find that the tradition and culture that shapes him and sends him is the very essence of what has drawn generations to this melting pot and makes it great.A compelling perspective of the immigrant's view looking in. We will all love our country more by reading it."
1,a waste of a perfectly good $12.50,"Don't support this abomination to ""music."" For every record sold, his ego gets inflated another bit, encouraging him to record more. And shame on the industry execs for supporting this, and wasting all of our time. If you enjoyed listening to this at all, go get a hearing aid and a brain scan."
1,"Amazon needs a ""No Stars"" rating..","Ok, people looking at this CD, or anything else William Hung has released, fall into 2 categories. The ones who think it's total crap, and the ones who somehow think it's a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke on anyone who buys the CD.People, the record label saw Hung, saw people support him, and thought to themselves ""Wow. We can make a load of money by giving him a CD and conning people into buying it."" There's no intentional humor, there's no fad or collector quality to it at all. It's blatant commercialism. William Hung should be ashamed of himself for this. The record label should be ashamed of themselves for not giving some other ""Idol"" hopeful who has talent a record contract.Bottom line, you wouldn't hire a plumber who didn't know what he was doing, so why facilitate the career of a singer who can't sing? Why put money in the pockets of record executives who have no respect for you?"
1,Disgusting,"Mr. Hung is ugly and utterly lacks talent. The major reason for his appeal and stardom (if one can call it such) is because he plays off the stereotype that Asians are bookworms and nerds who lack commonsense. Thanks to him, it became that much more difficult for Asian males to break into the American entertainment industry. In response to those who argue that he was passionate/determined and ought to be rewarded for pursuing his dream, one can say those exact words about Charles Manson.Regarding the album, Mr. Hung doesn't pronounce words correctly, sings right through his mouth, and has made a mockery out of Christmas. I listened to Silver Bells and Little Drummer Boy and that was all I could take.Hung has become a joke that isn't very funny at all."
3,"Bought it assuming it was awful, but I was still dissapointed","The cover art is great! As expected, the songs are really bad. It was a gag gift and it was good for a laugh. After playing it though you really just can't take more than a minute or two. We skipped through the songs in about 20 minutes and never played it again. Not worth it...If you can find it for under $5 WITH shipping, it does have some comedic value."
4,barmaster,"there is only one problem with this, there is no back light, so if ur in a dark bar, forget it.. I love that you dont have scroll through the whole alphabet to get to a drink, you can click on a letter it starts with instead"
5,Great Movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the story line was awesome, in that the lady decided to give back, i love those type movies, that show someone learning something from a negative beginning rather than just pouting and making matters worst. Wonderful that she stayed on to help run and fund the place.I would definitely reccommend it as a family movie."
3,Time piece,"One can't fault the selection of material on this 1966 live performance, and it does offer a glimpse into what this era was like. Unfortunately, the poor sound system and general pandemonium make for less than great listening. Brian Jones was nursing an injured hand, but he pulls it all off anyway."
1,"Awful, just awful",There is no reason to own this album because the music is drowned out by screaming girls and some of this was recorded in the studio with screaming overdubbed (WTF?) - AVOID. The worst live album by the Stones and maybe the worst live album ever.
2,"""GREAT ROCKANDROLL BAND IN OVERDUBBED LIVE ALBUM SHOCKER!!!""","I have been a Stones fan since the age of 11. I picked up an original vinyl copy of this record about 15 years ago, at about the time that I myself started to get together with some guys to play garage rock. I would make tapes of our little teenage band and then dub the scream track from the left speaker of Got Live If You Want It over our badly recorded, oversped, sloppy rockandroll. This is probably the closest we ever got to sounding like The Stones!! This album is intersesting as there are snippets of genuine live backing track which sounds like a band that's about to get pounded by thousands of screaming chicks! It sounds great at times but the very dodgy vocal overdubs ruin the effect entirely. Incidentally, there was an earlier British-only release EP by the same name which IS totally live. This record is great if you can get your hands on it!"
5,Wind against a blade of grass,"A truly superb collection of melodies from Ray Barretto! Ray gave me this CD himself months before his passing, and to this day, I still have not opened it. I had no idea what I was missing for all of these months until I allowed myself to listen to the sample tracks. ""Caper for Chris"" is without a doubt and in a word, moving! I'm not sure if this means that I will open the CD that Ray gave to me, and I'm sure he's saying, ""Papa, knock it off, and open the darn thing!"".For me the TIME spent with Ray while he WAS here IS still special to me, and his music will keep him here with us all."
5,underrated classic,"THIS IS AN ALBUM LOADED WITH OBSCURE GREAT SONGS THAT NEVER GOT RADIO AIRPLAY.EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LOVE DOWN THE ROAD APIECE,SURPRISE SURPRISE,OFFTHE HOOK,AND BO DIDDLEYS MONAARE AS GREAT AS ANY THING EVER RECORDED BY ANYONE.DOWN HOME GIRL IS A RARE GEM WITH ABSUPERB KIETH RICHARDS RIFF.AND OF COARSE THEIR REMAKE OF LITTLE RED ROOSTER IS SPECTACULAR.IF YOU LIKE THE BLUES THEN THIS LP IS A MUST. ITS A 5 STAR ALBUM IF THERE EVER WAS ONE."
5,Steadicam Merlin for Sony HDR-CX560V,"I love the Steadicam Merlin. Very high quality materials, perfect fitment on all parts, and comes with a great dvd tutorial.I use the Sony HDR-CX560V (1080p Flash Camcorder) with the Merlin and Sony NP-FV70 batteryUse hole ""C"" on the dovetail plate, (-5) on the spar distance gauge/folding hinge with one finish weight.Use one starter weight and one finish weight for the bottom spar.Use 1 or 2 ""Z"" turns out from all the way in. Depends how you like the balance.Use ""zero"" on the when mounting the dovetail plate to stage. Then turn ""fore and aft trim roller"" (+1)Hope this helps. Next cameras I put on will be the HDR-CX350V and the Canon T1i.The Merlin take time to balance (<45min) and learn (1hour+)."
2,No More Pain,"Van Damme and Dennis Rodman team up. Do I have to say anymore? This is garbage and I wanted a brick so badly to throw at my DVD player. I am usually upset with watching Van Damme movies, so I don't know why I put myself through this misery."
1,Silly and Predictable,"For those who can't get enough of superstar basketball player Dennis Rodman, he stars in this vechicle as a weapons guru who teams up with Van-Damme to fight bad guy Rourke, which leads to all the obvious twists and turns. Aimed primarily at the legion of Rodman fans, who presumably don't care how predictable the whole thing is."
1,No no no!,"Why? Van Damme has soooooo many good movies and this is the third one they decide to put in HD? Uhh..Universal Soldier, Cyborg, Death Warrant, Kickboxer, Hard Target, The Quest, Double Impact, In Hell, Wake of Death and of course BLOODSPORT! Come on now! I mean, sure, I'll buy this one only because I have every one of his movies on DVD and hope they release them all again in HD, but damn. I was really hoping for a better release :(I give this 1 star.."
3,"Van Damme good,Rodman stop the torture...","In 1997 Columbia Tristar released this highly anticipated action adventure thriller, starring action superstar Jean Claude Van Damme and his sidekick Dennis Rodman?Thats right Rodman was cast to support Van Damme.Excuse me did Rodman have any acting exposure before this tragedy,tragedy not on Van Dammes part but on Rodmans horrible acting skills.I actually enjoyed the action sequences that were in the film because they went on non stop and at full speed.Van Damme had showed better acting in some of his other films but this one wasn't horrible,it was good enough.The supporting cast needed some help and I believe thats what made the film fail.The box-office hype eventually left theaters a little earlier than expected,but still the film was pretty good."
5,Botti Fan,Watching Chris Botti perform is as great as just listening to him play. He is one cool Dude! He is sooo gifted to be able to play his horn as beautifully as he does. He and his trumpet are almost one entity! You have to love that jazz and show biz and he gives his all to you. Sigh! Jo Ann J.
4,Speak,"I would recommend this book to all teenagers.The name of the book is ""Speak"" by Laurie Halse Anderson.I liked this book, because it talks about the emotions and reactions of situations that would actually happen.This book talks about a likfe of a student that has just satrted Merryweather high-school. For Melinda Sordino school is a nightmare for her since the end of summer, when shocking events led her to call the police who busted a major party. Now she has no friends and gets alot of dirty looks for her ex-friends. THe only friend she has is a girl named Heather, the new girl, who only cares about hanging out with the right people and impressing others. She doesn't even care about Melinda at points, she talks about fitting in with different social groups.So if you wan't to read an interesting award winning book you should read Speak."
5,Don and Phil at their absolute best,"I was a teenager in high school when the Everlys made their success in Rock and Roll. Like my schoolmates, I rocked along with them at that time. But my roots are in bluegrass and traditional music like they sing on this album. My family comes from the Tennessee hills. Even back then I recognized their brand of harmony as coming from this form of music, even when applied to rock and roll tunes. I didn't find out about this album until years later, which I regret. It is my favorite Everly Bros. album. You will enjoy it a lot."
4,Great Old Unknown Album,"Probably very few people know of this one. It's a great work, but are the songs ever sad."
4,Like a flower bending in the breeze,"Here's an oddball concept: take some old ""adult pop"" songs of the '50s and '60s, and give them ""electronica"" remixes. Surprisingly, the results are actually pretty entertaining. Sure, some of the entertainment value is in the ""kitsch"" factor, but what's wrong with that? One of the most memorable remixes here is ""Sway"" by Dean Martin and Julie London. The weird thing is, Dean Martin and Julie London never recorded together. Their vocals on this remix are taken from two different versions of ""Sway"" which they recorded seperately. But you can't really tell that from listening to the remix here, it's pretty seamless. I don't think everyone will enjoy this album, but if you like to hear music that's somewhat offbeat, you may get a kick out of it."
2,Lacks believability,"The first few books in this series were interesting, especially to a dog lover and a mystery buff, but in the first chapter of this one, when the dog Jake removed an earring from Jackie's ear while she was driving, examined it, THEN REPLACED IT IN HER EAR!, the series dropped to the bottom of my personal buy-list."
2,Disappointment,I was disappointed with the quality of the book. Cheap paper. Not something I wanted to look over again and again like my other journals. Plus the book contained content about dreams and their interpretation. Something I am not interested in. The zodiac content also surprised me. There are plenty of other pregnancy diaries that you could purchase.
2,Doesn't measure up to 'Mouse Paint',"My kids love Mouse Paint, so we got Mouse Count, too. This one just doesn't hold their interest near as much. There's less action, I guess, and it is much less imaginative. We were disappointed."
3,Holman New testament commentary,I would really prefer a commentary that goes verse by verse through the book. Some of it was difficult to understand because I didn't have the same version of bible. Thank you.
2,I thought this was a concert dvd not videos of boys to men .,"If I wanted videos of boys to mens I would have downloaded it ! And the icing on the cake is... there are only 4 videos on the whole dvd, what a waste of money."
2,The Far East,"I thought the book was nice but not worth the price. Out of the entire book of 31 pages I found only six designs worth the time to do. I found the designs to be repetitive differing only in size. I would purchase a book of this type with more variety.Perhaps with Chinese symbols for hope,wisdom, etc ."
1,Clayton Graphical Picks,"They play fine, but don't expect a nice looking pick. I purchased the Angel and the Biohazard picks expecting them to look like the picture (a nice fake mother-of-pearl look). Instead they are generic picks, with either a sticker put on them, or the graphic is POORLY printed on the pick itself. It looks like it was done with a dot matrix printer from the late 80's. Everything is washed out, and you can barely make out what the picture is.Man, I was so dissapointed. The picture looked so nice too.."
1,Awful product,It fell apart as soon as I touched it. It's like a few plastic pieces put together. Do not buy it unless you're held at ransom to. I returned mine immediately and bought a monster fm transmitter. That works great.
1,problem with description,"In the description it says that this is compatible with ipod nano. However , it is not!!!"
2,Very Skippable,"Even as a colletion of odd and ends and some singles, this is an ultimately skippable album. Four of the songs are found on the much better collection Thru the Past, Darkly. The Stones version of the Temps ""My Girl"" is laughable. That leaves six songs to consider. ""Lady Jane"" is on the dark Aftermath, which if you're going to own the Stones catalog is much better than this album, even if it isn't one of my favorites. The only other songs worth having are ""Sittin' on a Fence"" and ""Out of Time."" Buying this album for two or three ""rarer"" songs just isn't worth it. If you want a collection of off the beaten track Stones, look for Hot Rocks II (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies) which also contains the psychedelic single ""Dandelion"" and it's very good B-Side (and true Beatles turned upside down track) ""We Love You."""
2,Caution -- This is a documentary . . . period.,"Very disappointed. This is not the DVD if you want to watch Elton John. It's true that there are video clips of him performing, but the vast majority of the DVD is commentary. The video clips only show short segments of his performances.If you want a GREAT DVD of Elton, buy ""Elton 60, Live at Madison Square Garden"". You won't be sorry!"
3,OGUNDE: A FANTASTIC JOURNEY,"The Impulse Records is great! The album is very interesting.The quality of the recording is not good as many of other live coltrane recordings. But the real highpoint of the album, certainly is the version of EXPRESSION Native ""OGUNDE"",with Trane powerfull solo and his wife Alice providing brilliant (Even not too Loud!) chords. Rashied Ali is also in prime form (and very near of the microphone phocus),one of the best drummers in jazz history.About the percussionists, here is an answer: WHERE IS JUMMA SANTOS ON THESE RECORDINGS?The album, finaly, is not essential like other trane`s very late albums like ""STELLAR REGIONS"" or ""NTERSTELLAR SPACE"", but is an important document of the last concert of a master:JOHN COLTRANE."
1,Can't beleive they let this get released.,"I can completely understand that with live recordings you don't get that ""in studio"" sound, but this Cd is unlistenable. It doesn't hurt me to say that I wasted money even close to how much it hurts me to say it was on something that John coltrane did. So distorted, no hint of any effort to remaster it; it is hard to beleive that he would have heard this recording and let it be released. Impulse and the coltrane name are two things I've grown to love and trust over the years; everyone makes mistakes so let's just hope this is a one time thing."
2,Too scientific,"Nice book although more for a scientist/student than a aquarium hobbyist or diver. Pictures are OK, names of corals are not consistent with other books. Lots of information but again still very hard to identify corals in the book to corals taken underwater![...]"
1,What the heck,"I don't know what is wrong with this thing, but it doesn't even work with my computer! I don't know if the product is a rip off or if it just doesn't work with vista. Worst of all, there were no instructions with it!!!"
5,"It is Cheap, they sent it Fast, and it Works","My laptop at work has Bluetooth connectivity built-in but my laptop at home does not. This cheap device gives my computer at home all the Bluetooth functionality of my other computer. Including shipping costs, this device costs about $6.50 - It is hard to beat that price."
5,my heroes have always been cowboys,"Rodeo cowboys Hoot Gibson, Don Coleman, and Art Acord, were the big names in western movies in the beginning. Jack Hoxie became a star and brother Al did, tooAll Around Cowboy Ken Maynard rode for Buffalo Bill, Higginback and Wallace Shows, Pawnee Bill's Wild West Show, and Ringling Brothers Circus before he hit it big in movies. 20th Century Fox signed him in 1922 for two reelers, but greater success came later in Saturdat matinee westerns.Ben Johnson, seen in so many John Ford and John Wayne westerns, won the title World Champion Team Roper in 1953. Clay O' Brien, the smiling little boy at Wayne's side in ""The Cowboys"" and ""Cahill, United States Marshal"" is Clay O'Brien Cooper now, seven time World Champion Team Roper and 1997 inductee in the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame,"
2,"Good movie, but it was scratched","Great movie, was delivered fast...but the movie was scratched. I was so excited to watch this movie and show it off to my firends, but when we were watching it..the DVD skipped for over half of the movie. Was disappointing"
5,THIS BOOK RULES!,I think this strategy guide is helpful!Other people may not but I do!well thats all for meByy
4,"This one's okay, but...","I must say, this guide is very good, and gives alot of good tips. But, in my copy, there were alot of errors. Words were spelt wrong, things were missing, and boss strategies were incorrect. The biggest let down was that it has NO STRATEGY FOR THE LAST BOSS FIGHTS. All it says is to refer to another boss strategy. And because of this, I had a hard time, and have not been able to win, not having any hints. Hey, don't think I just bought the game and used the guide through the whole thing. It wasn't until the end of disc 2 that I got it, and tried not to use it much."
5,A great book for anyone who wants the best for FF8.,A great book to teach you all the techniques and strategies of Final Fantasy VIII. That's All Folks!
3,A die hard Final Fantasy Player,"This book is alright. As said above by many people, the layout kinda sucks. Everyone also says to print out the online walkthrough. First, if you want color, the printing will take you days. Second, online walkthroughs are like what, 200 pages? If it costs even 1 cent per page, thats 2 bucks, and it's going to be hard to staple or put into a book. Also, you might want to have a couple of spare ink cartiges available. Anyways, get the book, because it helps."
3,Not worthy of your money!?!,"I don't yet own, but have seen it. Do not spend your money on a walkthrough, get one off the net. They are many and well written. So, save your money to go get something!"
4,It's Great!!,"This book is very good, it is easy to read and understand, it's just that this book makes the game not fun because it tells you all the answers for the hard puzzles, if you want to enjoy the game don't get the book, it just takes the fun out of it. It can help when you're stuck, though."
2,If there are no other options...,"This book had minimal useful information drowned out by tons of verbose, redundant paragraphs with spelling mistakes. It talked more about identifying stress then really being able to tell if someone was lying. The useful information in that book filled about 4 pages worth of space. All the rest is repetative and common sense. Very little of it provoks the response of ""oh wow, i didn't know that."" If you are looking for a book on lie detection, don't consider this as a first choice."
2,A little disapointed,"It is not easy to handle and shakes once fixed on the windshield, I am not sure if I will keep it."
4,Chucho's nice flow,"This is my first foray into the ""cubop"" genre, and chucho slams. i found out about him while listening to bluenote.com's radio station. being a go-go head, the congos are more appealing to me than the rest of the quartet. anyway, my favorite cuts are el rumbion, briyumba palo congo, and caravan."
1,comedy,This film is so bad it's funny....I give anyone who can make a feature some credit...but this one is soooo terrible it ranks there with Showgirls as almost good because it's sooo bad.
4,Movie is a 3 1/2 but soundtrack is a 5!,"A good examination of the female gender's search for authentic intimacy. With the plethora of good lesbian erotica we have now since Claire came out (pun intended), this is still a good one for us Nicole Conn fans. It deserves an honored place on the shelf next to your overly-viewed copy of 2010's ""Elena Undone"" if you're anything like me. The soundtrack is fantastic, though, running from classical piano thru C & W, and the best is a really juicy Teresa Trull song, ""Would It Hurt?"" No, it wouldn't, but you'll be sorry if you pass on this, at least for rental. Nicole Conn understands how to write and stage believable seduction scenes. If her name is at the helm, you need to watch.Trust me on this, girls!"
5,I love it!,"I have read many of the reviews of this movie and I am perplexed at the number of negative reviews. I was hooked after the first viewing. For a low budget film, the message is extraordinary. An uplifting story about two women who against all odds find love with each other. As someone who has been through a similar situation, I was truly touched. I watch it every chance I get. If you want a beautiful story of a growing relationship, then this is the film for you...but for those of you that just watch movies like this for the ""porn value"" then you are out of luck. (I think that was the problem with some of the other reviewers). Anyway, this continues to be one of my most favorite films ever. Kristen, Texas"
2,What a Disappointment,"Finally succumbing to friend's urging, I rented ""Claire of the Moon""....... what a disappointing waste of time that was! The dialogue made me cringe, the acting was alternately wooden or over-the-top, and the whole production in general was stereo-type-laden and preachy. Even the sexy scenes failed to excite, being over-choreographed and unrealistic. I do understand the need for intelligent, sexy lesbian films, but director Nicole Conn, in all her earnest political-correctness, totally missed the mark. She could take lessons from the great director Donna Deitch, whose beautiful ""Desert Hearts"" remains the standard for lesbian-identified films...simple, sweet, and tender, with wonderfully understated acting and delicious love scenes."
4,"Hyperablized words, Beautiful music, overall strange & amble","I've watched this movie six to seven times a day, words and phrases are stained in mind. I had to use a dictionary just to complete my parody of it. All in all I found it to be quite peaceful. The movement of people, music, and acting is unrealistic but I loved it just the same, to future viewers, have an open mind to the enigma of its place, time, and closeness. Make your own opinion of it."
3,Claire of the Moon,I have watched this at least 20 times.Tricha Todd is so sexy.So pretty. Her acting was'nt all that great.I liked the way the story went.She is so hot!!! I also got her book. very good!! Its worth the money just to watch her.
3,CG/AUX Crew Candidates - OUT OF DATE MATERIAL,"Members of the USCG and CGAUX should be aware that this is a private publication of an outdated 2002 version of the USCG Boat Crew Seamanship Manual (COMDTINST M16114.5 series). The current version (May 2009) can be downloaded free of charge at the CHDIRAUX website (for Auxiliarists) and is also available online through the USCG Directives system. Since the BCSM manual is intended for reference and not cover-to-cover reading, it is seldom necessary to have a printed copy. The author is to be commended for a creative solution at a time when fewer members had broadband access, but today's crew and coxswain candidates should be aware that this out-of-date material is not officially supported and may contain incorrect information."
4,Learn the fundamentals!,This book covers vital fundamentals for seamanship. Definitely worth owning and great to share with less experienced people.
3,get set for okay,"the album is not bad, but it's not great. give mtv credit for playing an unknown band, but not a great start. get set is a great song, but the rest lack the great harmony and sound of get set. if you want a new sound try it, if your not don't bother."
2,Get Set For A Bunch Of Sound The Sames,"OK, yes Get Set is a five star song, no doubt. But as a whole the album doesn't really compare. I mean some songs are nice, but they lack the strength of Get Set. I've listened through it about 5 times and the only other track that stands out is the 4th one so far. Overall, it reminds me of Jars of Clay (who are much better). I just wish these guys had a couple heavy songs to break up the monotony. The lyrics need some work as well. Anyone looking for the combined vocal sound and a heavier guitar check out Pushmonkey."
5,CANT WAIT FOR THE ALBUM!!!!,"I absoultely can't wait to hear the entire album! The harmonies in ""can you feel/get set"" are unbelievable. If that song is any indication of what the rest of their music is like I'm sure I will not be disappointed. I unfortunately, haven't been able to find any info on the band. The song is so refreshing considering all of the hard rock crap that is being deemed as groundbreaking. I can only hope the rest of their material gets exposure too. I'd hate to see them turned into one-hit wonders."
4,Very enjoyable read.,"My father, and two of his brothers smoke jumped out of Missoula in the late 40's. Reading this book took me back to the days when they would reminisce about their experiences. Jumping on a fire, working around the clock and carrying out a pack weighing close to 100 pounds when it was all over is a testament to what these men were made of. The writer worked summers to finance his way through college. This book is a testament to what is possible in America with a strong work ethic and a passion to succeed."
3,Slipshod,"A tossed together collection of singles and album tracks recorded between 1966 and 1969, issued in memoriam Brian Jones (in an octagonal sleeve!) and notable for being the only way to get Jumping Jack Flash and Honky Tonk Women on album for a few years. Pretty redundant now, particularly as the US version presented here is noticeably put together with less care than the unavailable UK one. The three stars are for the music."
1,Totally Disappointed,This must be the worst recorded Rolling Stones LP. I didn't even finish listening to the record. Listened to Side One and turned around and sold it to a used LP dealer and took a $45 loss. I was beyond my comprehension how someone could ask $55 for it. Will be a lot more cautious buying over priced records from now onward.
3,Predictable Maybe?,"This book was very predictable. The author wrote very interestingly about life in England when your single looking for Mr. Right or Mr. Maybe. The pompous, rich Englishman was described very well. I would say that the publishers of the paperback should of used a different picture for the cover, since holding the book to read at work was a little embarrassing. People thought I was reading a real trashy romance novel."
5,Totally enjoyable,"I loved this book. I feel in love with the character who stumbles through relationships which mirror ones we all know that we have had, all the while thinking the very thoughts you deny having yourself. Light, endearing, and sweet. Only advice, read somewhere you can laugh loud. Read it, and then give it to you best girlfriend."
4,"Mr. Maybe is good, but not Green's best","I realy enjoyed Mr. Maybe however I thought that it was a litle too simiar to bookends and jemima J. I reallly like Jane Green and i thought they were all very good books, but a little more variety woud be nice"
4,Easy Read,"This book is an enjoyable escape book. I read it literally in two days and i thought it was very good. Funny - Witty and Interesting. A ""Girl's Book""."
4,If you liked 'Jemima J'.......You'll LOVE Mr. Maybe!,"If you thought Jemima J was good--wait till you read Mr. Maybe. It's even better, being that it's more grown-up and realistic (jemima J had to resort to the very UNbelievable ""bizarre fetish"" excuse, where in Mr. Maybe there is none of that last-minute scrap). It reads REAL, and feels REAL. It will really hit home to you, making you identify the characters with either yourself or someone you know. In addition, Libby is even more likeable than Jemima J, and she radiates a sense of kindred womanhood that we can all relate to. Sometimes the sophomore effort pays off, and that is absolutely true in Jane Green's case. Jemima J--i thought it was great. And then I read Mr. Maybe--it totally outshines them all."
3,a book to read when u feel like chilling out,"Mr maybe is a lot of emotions that goes through the mind of a 27 something working women. It relates lot to the present day lifestyles of lot of women, who are willing to give up the good things for money. But in this book libby realises her mistake before she ties the knot.Libby's life with her friends is something admirable. A lot of similarities between all our lives with friends.It is a very easy to read book and to me it looked like the plot of a hindi film"
5,Yummy,"Vastly entertaining first-person stream of consciousness writing. I enjoyed this book quite a lot, especially the romance aspect, and particularly the ""hero"" Nick, who was exceedingly representative of the vast majority of single men in the world today.Hillarious. Witty. Touching. Ladies, you will love it, and men, you will laugh. On par with Bridget Jones, to be sure.Highly recommended."
3,A Maybe Book.,"I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this, but I also wouldn't recommend it. It was an entertaining read that was light with quirky characters. Yes, Libby is shallow and selfish, but those are flaws that many women have. That's not what ruins the book.The problems start about halfway through, when Libby is clearly not interested in the man she's dating but finds it hard to break up with him because he's rich. It's just unpleasant to read about because she's so disgusted by him, but she still can't bring herself to ditch him.All in all, read it if you have nothing else to read, but there are better books that you can get for the same price. Borrow it from the library if you're really interested."
4,The old question: What women want ?,"The story is enjoyable but I didn't like the ""heroin"", Libby, that sounded more like a vilain. Can someone explain why men will fall for a size 12 woman (fat), don't know how to cook, shop only designer clothes, is an orgasm demanding [...] who expects her man to be perfect (handsome, rich, caring, funny, etc) while she is not even an oil painting beauty, throphy woman material?I wished that at the end she didn't get any guy. Continue being single, pay for her designer clothes with her meager salary of PR or borrow from dad. No wonder guys are commitmentphobic nowadays. What can he earns by dating a designer clothes lover who can barely cook, is [...] like that? No wonder guys will rather go out with the boys. With women like that, it is much more preferable to continue being single or have flings only with [...] like that. Though Ed went through a heartache, believe, it is much better being single that being snatched by a woman like that."
3,Maybe fun...,"This was a fun if superficial read - found the characters to be interesting but hard to camouflage the fact that this is a branzen Bridget Jones knock-off. A better page turner about a young publicist is ""Buzz"" by Carrie Lieber - a story that's a bit more sophisticated and the story line is much fresher."
2,Robinson Crusoe,"The long awaited ""Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"" has finally arrived on home video on DVD by VCI. This DVD entitled ""Robinson Crusoe"" purports to be a ""restoration."" The original film had two things going for it - a fine performance by Dan O'Herlihy and vivid color. VCI got one out of two. The so-called restoration's color is sub-par, although they managed to get a lot of dirt and scratches out, the color is not close to being vivid. It didn't help that it was filmed in bargain basement Pathecolor. The sound track has on and off thumping noises that are most annoying. Only if you are a fan of this film is it worth seeing or even buying. This restoration looks like it was one of those digital jobs. VCI should leave the restorations to Criterion and Robert A. Harris. I was really looking forward to this DVD but ended up being badly disappointed."
3,It was a gift; recipient LOVED it!,I had never heard of this movie until my boyfriend mentioned that he loved it as a young boy. So I went searching...and gold old Amazon had it! It was a great surprise to my boyfriend. He watched it immediately and loved it.
2,Poise Pantiliners,"Well my goodness, talk about the economy the manufacturer has shortened these liners considerably, I was very disappointed with the product."
2,Outdated,"The links in this textbook on communication don't work. For a book on current technology, the information is dated."
5,ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH AS SUSPIRIA AND P. ROSSO,"This is an excellent soundtrack. I have not seen the film,but I can't wait after hearing this soundtrack. I can just picture the cold calculating murder that must dwell about in this film.Goblin always reminds me of a futuristic but primal plague of technological horror,and the collapse of sanity. One collection of track's that is extremely interesting is Death Farm Animals,it is like a mini suite of menace. I am so glad that Goblin(the original)is back together again making soundtracks. I would love to see them collaborate with Ennio Morricone sometime in the future."
3,medical routine - very strong; mystery - anemic,"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Clement. I found the mystery portion to be rather simplistic - if you pay attention, you know who the murderer is long before the ending. The doctor protagonist is constantly walking headlong into traps, not to mention being suspicious of everyone, mostly without much reason.So why did I eagerly finish it? The author's knowledge of hospital practices regarding the detection, prevention and treatment of deadly diseases, not to mention the details of the post-mortem and other medical routine was fascinating.Also interesting is the relationship between the doctor and his obstetrician wife - I'm a sucker for a good husband/wife team."
3,Close but no cigar.,"The back cover blurb and inside praise for Lethal Practice convinced me to buy this book but I was disappointed. It definitely was NOT a page-turner for me. I finished it only because I wanted to see how it would end. My main complaint is that there isn't much action to propel the plot. The novel is chiefly about hospital politics (boring), and I found myself not really caring about most of the characters. I figured out who the killer was about halfway through the book because the culprit is the least likely suspect. The medical portions are well done but that's not enough to make up for the shortcomings. If you want to read an excellent novel dealing with an emerging unstoppable infectious organism try The Third Pandemic by Pierre Ouellette. Another action-packed medical thriller is Threshold by Ben Mezrich. I also recommend the books by Tess Gerritsen."
4,A Classic mid sixties Lp by The Rolling Stones,"Aftermath to me was one of the best, if not the best, Rolling Stones Lp ever recorded. It was the first Stones Lp to consist of all original Jagger/Richards compositions. The Lp included the number one hit ""Paint It Black"" and the American top forty hit ""Lady Jane"", it also includes the very popular ""Under My Thumb"". Their are other underrated gems such as ""Doncha Bother Me"", ""High And Dry"", ""I Am Waiting"" and the ten minute ""Goin' Home"". Besides Mick Jagger and Keith Richard blossoming as songwriters, the late Brian Jones is beginning to flourish as a musician playing Indian sitar, dulcimer, marimbas, harmonica, keyboard and guitar, making Aftermath one of the most musically colorful Lp's the Rolling Stones ever recorded. It' a classic."
4,Good Early Stones,"Catching the Stones at the crossroads of pop success and being true to their blues roots. The second side is the hot side, from ""Route 66' (a rocking live take) to the live ""I'm Moving On"" (yes, the Hank Snow song). Probably their best hodgepodge (I.E. not hits collection) until TATTOO YOU."
5,No Guilt eating this item,"I have been eating these NUGO bars for a few years now. They are filling, taste like a chocolate peanut butter flavored rice crispy type treat without being too sweet, and very portable. They totally satisfy a sweet tooth craving or if you just need a between meal snack. I would recommend them to anyone who loves chocolate peanut butter combos and wants a healthy nutrition bar. Just beware of leaving them in your car in the summer (they melt) or get cold (they get tough to eat- too stiff) other than that go for it and eat up."
3,great tasting but stale?,i love the bars but the box i order from Amazon seemed a bit stale... the expiration date was good though. hope it was a rare instance.
