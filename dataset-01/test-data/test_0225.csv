3,"Decent book, abysmal index","The book is a perfectly fine text. It's quite understandable and informative. I've had tremendous problems with the index, however. It consists of only one page, and it has thousands of laughable omissions. I can't believe Dr. Clegg (and associates) allowed this book to be published with such a terrible, terrible index. This is a text book, kids. It needs a thorough index."
2,Not loud enough,I like the stand but the volume level is just not loud enough. I would suggest trying another product
4,An excellent read,"Having to read this text for a university class, I initially did not expect to enjoy it as throughly as I actually did - I had the mindset that I would just read it once, just because I had to, and that would be that. Yet I enjoyed this book completely, with its realism and frank, yet emotional, portrayal of Indian life. I would recommend it to all; its simpistic style makes it accessible to younger readers. Whether you are interested in Indian culture or not, I guarantee you will be by the final page."
1,ONE STAR for POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP,"I expected a lot more from Jet. Here are the problems that I had:1.) the jointer had a CROOK at the end of the infeed table. That's unimaginable but it's true!2.) the top of the cabinet had several DENTS on ALL FOUR CORNERS of its top. It looked as though someone used a HAMMER to shape out the corners of the cabinet.I was so dissappointed with the finish of my jointer since I spent so much time and research debating on which one to buy.That said, I'll be packing it up to exchange it for a new one.I give ""fit and finish"" ONE star. I'll save my performance review for after I receive my replacement."
2,"Comprehensive though flawed content, childish writing tyle.","Paid full price for this book a number of years ago and picked it up again today.As the title of this ""review"" states, the contents are quite comprehensive, though the structure of the book is somewhat messy.What has always niggled me about this book is the extremely poor humour used therein. I'm a pretty lighthearted guy but the ""forced"" coding-is-kewl humour is *extremely* irritating...I've also yet to see a decent game title written by this guy - his other credentials aside."
1,"Boring, Dumb, Unfunny, Waste of Time","This is supposed to be a comedy? This movie is not funny or creative. If your idea of entertainment is watching boring, balding, whining, Paul Giamatti have a mid life crisis about acting and losing his soul, then this is your kind of movie.This movie is stupid and the dialog is flat and forced at times. I would not waste my time on such garbage. The whole Russian soul stealing thing is just dumb. And the ending of the movie, what ending??? It just stops. I wish I would have hit the stop button 20 min into it."
1,"Sorry, Paul, not your best...","I LOVE Paul Giamatti, and I had high hopes for this movie, but, sorry...didn't make more than 30 minutes before I shut it off. This is one of those movies with an AWESOME premise that totally fails in delivery/execution, in my opinion.Look forward to seeing what Mr. Giamatti does next."
4,NFSU vs. SRS.....And the winner is,"Stree Racing Syndicate. This is defintely the best Street Racing game that has ever hit game consoles. You can rome around and do basically anything you want to. Trick out over 40 cars, Race for some girls,cash and better yet your opponents wheels. The only hing that is a downfall is how the car gets damaged. It's way better than Need For Speed Underground's (NFSU) and it also makes it very realistic, don't get me wong. But it makes the gameplay go down, because you hve to take money and go repair it. If you do not then your Horse power as well as overall car performance will go down.And car repairs can range from $189- $6,000. Overall I give this game a 4.999, only being downplayed because of the damage. If you are a true Street Racer or gmer. You would DEF-INI-TELY get this game."
3,eh........,"this game sounds great reading the features and stuff, but i was highly dissapointed. need for speed underground is so much better, and i can't wait for underground 2 to come out in november. just buy underground if you want a good racing game, and then get 2 in november."
1,Worst of the series....,"I thought this game was pretty cool at first, but It then slid way down the hill of awsomeness meaning it sucked. No flashligh, ghosts drain health as you stand near them, and they dont die! Worst of all, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TOWN OF SILENT HILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They just took all the worst Ideas of silent hill and combined it into a game and called it SIlent Hill 4. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! IT IS THE WORST, MOST BORING GAME EVER, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I ALREADY MADE THAT MISTAKE!"
3,This game was all-right,"Silent Hill is usually one of my favorite games but this time was different, this game was clearly bad. I loved the music and the graphic but the controls were really messed up and I had problems getting around things."
1,Let's be honest,Gary D. is cute and stupid like we expect. The action is cheesy and poorly directed like we expect. But we really all should be tired of teachers driving a Mercedes and living in a million dollar home. Don't rent it. Really.
2,For Physicists More Than Fans,"I never thought I'd say this, but this book is just too technical to be any fun. It is SOOOO detailed in its explanation of the various physical forces at work in a baseball game that the book takes way too long to get anywhere. Worse still, the book isn't organized very well, so if you want to just skip to the ""punchline"" to figure out what the author's trying to tell you (e.g. curveballs really do curve, fastballs don't really rise, corked bats don't help), it's very difficult to do. I love physics, and I love baseball, so I thought I'd love this book, but I'm sorry to say that it left me cold."
5,Want to be more than a Survivor?,"This is an uplifting tale of survival - physical and spiritual. With the harsh beauty of the Pecos Wilderness as its backdrop, this story draws you through an incredible struggle with nature and morality. It all begins with the crash of a small plane in the heart of a vast forest, but you must decide where it will end. Is it enough to be content in life, or should you risk the pain and reach for something more? I really enjoyed the splendor and power of nature in this book. I didn't realize that there are still places in America so wild and remote. I think I learned a bit about survival - more than I have from Survivor. This story, however, goes far beyond the battle to simply stay alive. That is what makes it so special. It reminds you how to live!"
1,False lashes for Real,The product description of 100% human hair is false. I was looking for some lashes that were made from real human hair so saw this product since the description stated it was made from real hair. When I received the product I knew it was not real hair especially since I have black hair myself. Don't be fooled by this product!
1,This is INK not a PRINTHEAD,"I ordered a printhead, but Amazon sent ink. The package says ink on it, but Amazon or its partners put a label on it saying ""printhead"". Someone obviously didn't know the difference."
4,fun puzzle to learn to read basic words,"I am a mom and my daughter is starting to read small words. This really helps her practice. I really like the puzzle I only have one little drawback. It is a tiny one and probably just me being picky. All the different pairs are different colored backgrounds. So sometimes instead of trying to read and sound out the word she would just look for the picture that has the same colored background. I think it would be more beneficial if all the pieces were the same color so the child would have to sound out the word. Other than that I really like this product. The pieces seem quite durable, therefore I consider it a valuable and educational addition to a playroom."
3,Picture is deceptive,"This does NOT come with the pen...I ordered it thinking it was a set, but as I looked closer after I had received the book only I realized the pen was separate...Otherwise good quality..the hearts on the book can be used as a pin later..."
4,COMMENTS BY GRAHAM JONES,INNOVATION AND EXCELLENT SKILL OF R BOLITHO ONCE AGAIN TO THE FORE.AWFUL BLOODSHED IN CLOSE ENGAGEMENTS.A GOOD STORY
2,"Not bad but not that good, either","For those who enjoy naval fiction and are expecting something of quality (an O'Brian or Forester, perhaps) you are likely to be disappointed. It's not bad; just not very well written. In addition to an abundance of clich√©s, Kent/Reeman employs bizarre similes which regularly `slap' the reader out of the narrative, straight back to the printed page. In addition, the novels tend to be predictable and over sentimental. They are not bad but they are not that good, either."
2,Skip this one and wait for the final book,"Books 1 and 2 are interesting and fun. Book 3, however, is a big let down. I kept expecting things to turn up a notch and finally seeing some big actions but nope. The majority of the book is spent setting up for the upcoming conflict, new characters and new plots are being introduced--not all of which are interesting. I'm afraid this series might turn into another Wheel of Time. Better just skip the rest of the books in the series and get the final book if you've already bought the first two books."
4,A Whirlwind Overview,"This PBS documentary is, as stated in the title, a quick and selective historical narrative. It mostly covers the Tokogawa political history and the impact of the West, especially that of Christianity. It takes the viewer from the beginning of Shogun Japan through to its demise. In other words, from the time Westerners first reached Japan until the arrival of Commodore Perry. This video uses a compilation of sources from an outside point of view as well as using local historical documentation. It focuses on the differences of Japan in comparison to the West and the depth and advancements of the complexities of historical Japan. I enjoyed the use of dramatic recreation, but thought that it could have gone into more detail on the cultural aspects of isolationalism. This video is great for those who wish to learn more about Japan's past and have no prior historical knowledge of this era."
3,"informative, with colorful visual imagery, but little correlation between the narration and video","This video is very informative. As a moderately knowledgeable person on Japanese history during the ""warring era"", I still learned new information. The visual images are colorful. However, this is more like an audio book with very loosely associated video images. It doesn't contain the variety of re-enactments, ""on-location"" views of historical events, historical photos and/or art work that connect directly to the spoken narrative."
2,Teacher Accesses Memoirs of a Secret Empire,"My students were thoroughly bored with this film. I tried to elicit their attention by giving some preliminary information; having a short preview and a sort of ""what to watch for"" information to direct students' attention to what was important in the film. This is essential for 8th graders especially and for educational reasons in particular.We found the film repeated the same information so much that it was wasting our precious class time. Much of the information was interesting; however, it could have been given in a more dynamic manner and in less time by not repeating the same thing about only a few people. Normally, PBS has motivating films that capture my students' attention. We were all disappointed. I will not show this film next year although I have not yet found a substitute that covers the same time span. I need something on ancient Japan from the 600s to the 1600s AD, the rise of military society, shoguns, daimyos, and samurai warriors."
1,Broke within a few months,"We replaced one bathroom faucet with the intention of replacing the rest later, however the first one we replaced broke within a few months. The metal in the handle broke. I expected more out of Moen."
5,Small Faces The Singles Collection,Beautifully designed and packaged 6 CD single set from Essential UK. Each CD comes in it's original picture sleeve. As if this were not enough it also includes a beautiful poster. It's also a limited edition. This is prime period Small Faces '67-'69 at the height of Psychedelia which they were tops!
3,Good short stories,"Though I usually do not like to read short stories, these short stories are good. They are good in part due to the character in them, V.I. Warshawski. She is the glue that holds them together and creates our interest in seeing what she has gotten herself into again and again. A great read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Did not work with my dog,"My dog has rancid breath, bad plaque, and plaque builds up very quickly. Based on these rave reviews, I was hoping that there would be much improvement. After several weeks, the entire tube, and teeth brushing every day, I have not seen any improvement. I still gave it 2 stars because it didn't make her teeth worse and who knows, maybe it does a little something still. But overall, I would not buy this again. I am trying other products."
2,A matter of taste,"This composer is no ""Mozart"".One minute of really great melody,and forty-nine minutes of filler."
4,GET THIS CLASSIC COLLECTION,"If Laura canales appeals to yuou, this is the only CD yuo need. It has a selection of great songs. On Stage, she was a powerful and confident singer. She paved the way for women in the Tejano industry, the first true DIVA in Tejano. Check out AMOR ESCONDIDO...However this CD does not contain (Shame on yuo EMI!!!) DEJAME...remade by Elida Reyna (GET THAT COPY)."
3,Not up to the Princeton Review standard,"After being thoroughly impressed with the Princeton Review's guide for AP Chemistry the year before, I bought the AP bio book with high expectations. However, this book proved to be disappointing. To begin with, Princeton pared down the subject way too much- too little information was given on each bio topic. Even worse, the book is ridden with typos, a characteristic that should not be found in an $18 prep book.This study aid could not be called ""bad,"" but I would consider Cliff's prep book over this one. Princeton Review needs to make some serious modifications to this book."
2,Inaccuracies astounding!,"This book was obviously not edited as there are mistakes in actual material such as ""cytosine is a purine."" Additionally, although the chapter reviews are helpful, the tests are a bit ridiculous in that they sometimes use methods not really expressed in the book. Get something else!"
4,Great value for money,"I'm not really a great fan of Naxos. I am, however, a great fan of romantic pianists, and since Alkan was one of the and the Naxos recording was the only one I could get...well, I had to buy it! And I'm glad I did. This recording is amazing! First of all, I was amazed by the many aspects in Alkans music, but even more so by the quality of the recording. Ever note stands out and is perfectly clear (well, as clear as can be when it's alkan we are talking about!). The two performers are obviously the right choice for this recording and it's a shame that I haven't heard of them before. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Alkans music, this is $6 well spend...just wait till you hear ""The Railway"", that is simply amazing, it's a wonder that anyone is actually playing like that! a really good cheap recording like this is hard to find, so do yourself a favour and buy it!"
5,(No title).,"This is an excellent, excellent disc. However, the content is only selections duplicated from complete recorded performances previously available (in their entirety) on Marco Polo by Bernard Ringeissen and Laurent Martin... This is an excellent introduction to Alkan, no doubt, and the price is beautiful! However, you may be a little wary after buying this (which is basically a great hits compilation) to go for the more serious stuff available elsewhere... Most likely unnecessary purchases for Alkaholics."
4,Alkan: The Railway and other Piano Works,Alkan: The Railway and other Piano Works is a recording played by Laurent Martin and Bernard Ringeissen recorded by Naxos from 1992. I had no prior knowledge who Alkan was and picked it up by random at my local library. The booklet cointains liner-notes written by Keith Anderson which are both informative and well-written. Recommended. 4/5.
1,Out of date & full of mistakes,"For the first time in my life I returned this book to the library. It is full of mistakes and so out of date that a lot of the discussion is either irrelevant or redundant. It uses old-style casts, is not const-correct, doesn't make any reference to the standard library. I've even seen a '#define kPoolSize 4096'! (p. 285) This is supposed to be an advanced book on C++ (although it repeats what exceptions and templates are) but read instead 'Design Patterns' and '(More) Effective C++'. You will know a lot more afterwards."
5,Rad,"These are great for drumming. The ""dipped"" part makes it easier to hold your grip while rocking out and they look cool"
1,Not packaged well,I bought these as a xmas gift for my father. The sticks were not in any type of plastic. There was a piece of cardboard holding them together. This was packaged with other items. A sticker from another item somehow got on the textured part of the drumstick. I am unable to get this off without scratching the stick. So just be aware when ordering.
3,Good throw-aways; bad longevity.,"I bought two pair of these from another vendor. I was told there was a two year warranty. The dipped grips are really cool and tacky; I never dropped one of these while I used them. I work in a home studio though and am not a gigging drummer. I found that after a few days the grips would develop holes, right around where the thumb makes contact. I decided to go with stick wrap which worked much better with highly increased longevity.If you are a performing drummer these might last one of two gigs before the grips start coming apart - then you will have to strip and wrap them. I also play an Alesis DM8-Pro Electronic kit with rubber rim silencers and rubber cymbals, so the sticks do not get chewed up like with an acoustic set of drums. I was surprised that at this price the main feature of the sticks just did not hold up. This is the wrap I now use and I love it!Pro-Mark SRCW Stick Rapp Drumstick Wrap, Checkerboard White/Black"
4,Works perfectly after annoying rattle fixed,"Bought this mirror and installed it and it now works perfectly. I love it.But, it did have an annoying rattle that I had to fix. The small plastic lens in front of the compass and temperature display is not firmly seated. It was just sort of floating. This appears to be a design issue. As I went over bumpy roads the lens cover rattled. To fix this, I put a dab of glue (I used RTV or silicon seal) on each side on the plastic cover lens where it touches the main plastic frame. It fixed the rattle and it is hardly noticeable."
5,fantastic mirror,"I agree totally with the first review. This mirror is GREAT. After trying numerous types of devices for N,E,S,W directives this one surpasses them all. The tempature guide and lights make this a perfect addition if your car didn't originally come equipped with one. Priced very well. Was easy to install."
3,Good Quality but very difficult to install,"I bought this item after reading some of the reviews. It's very good quality, however there are very few people who would have the equipment and be able to install it themselves. I had to pay a mechanic to install it. On a positive note, it works well and does what it's supposed to."
2,Buy from another company,"Belltower shipped textbook in a clear plastic bag. Book was more beat up then expected (possibly because it had absolutely ZERO shipping protection. Took 3-4 days for a response to the TWO emails I sent. And once they finally did respond, it was with the same identical generic message. Wouldn't suggest Belltower to anyone. I purchased 3 other textbooks on Amazon at the same time as the one I purchased from Belltower and had a great experience. I'd suggest using a different company than Belltower, then maybe you will get your text book in the proper shipping box or envelop and not a sealed clear plastic bag!"
1,Totally Biased and Irrational,"The issues the author, Ingraham, has with homosexuality and society come permeate the book to such an extent that any potentially valid points are tainted by her bias. Her bent also drives her to make poorly reasoned arguments, causing one to question the validity of her better cases.For example, at one point she attempts to link blame on average Americans that buy wedding dresses to the economic slavery of East Indian islanders. While I agree that the purchasing choices we make have a greater impact on the world around us that we would like to admit, her argument suffers from gross oversimplification and deceptively focuses on this one issue of traditional Western wedding practices, when in reality it applies to many, if not all, purchasing decisions.I could not bring myself to finish this book as the irrationality of the arguments and obvious hating and blaming towards heterosexuals and traditional culture took precedence over genuine exploration of issues."
4,Portishead that you can dance to,"Their first effort Supertron is the more accessible album - each song on that album has immediate first-listen appeal; the more mature sounding Stems definitely takes a bit longer to grow on you. It's experimental and way less poppy, using more white space and sparse arrangements. Either album is a good buy, but getting them together makes for a eclectic musical experience.We've enjoyed seeing Fading Collection live twice now and enjoy. Lead singer has goosebump-inducing pipes - well worth it if they visit your town."
5,The Best of Sunz of Man,"Old Testament is the CD you want if your new to the group and want to hear the best songs from Sunz of Man. Soldiers of Darkness, Saviorz Day, Five Arch Angels,Shining Star...they all here. If your a wu fan you won't be dissapointed from Sunz of Man. Also if you like these guys and the Wu I would Strongly recommend you pick up some ""Killarmy"". I wish I could find some Killarmy in stores..."
1,Freakingly Awful Book,"I first read this book when I was 11, and it freaked me out. If I had to choose the most traumatic book I've ever read it would be this one. While I was a little younger then the intended age group it still might upset older reader. Maybe it would be useful for teens with issues, but on the other hand it just might push them over the edge. Be very careful about giving this book to a child, the main character's actions and feeling are less then healthy."
4,Language of the Goldfish,This book is good so I will give it 4 stars.The main caracter is called Carrie and she moved from North Point. She cannot fit into her new life. Then she gets diaay and daydreams about a island. After meeting Dr.Ross she tries to control the daydream and she visites him often. At the end she finds out the reason.This is a good book and at the same time this is what some people might feel if they were new.
1,Larry McMurtry Didn't Write This Book,"Or at least I hope not. This book is boring, and I couldn't care less about what happens to the characters. They aren't likeable, they aren't interesting, and I hope I never hear from them again. I kept waiting for the ""good parts"" and they never came. Total waste of precious reading time. This calls for a new adage: ""Don't judge a book by it's author""."
1,So it wasn't just ME,"Thankfully this book came to me in a big cardboard box with lots of other loaners... I struggled through this novel thinking that I must be missing something... afterall, LARRY MCCURTY is a Pulitzer Prize winner! Did he really write this??? I have never read his work before - though I've seen screen productions of several. Imagine this in living color at your local Cineplex! I'd need REALLY good popcorn and plenty of it. Boring. Repetitive. Pointless. Did I say repetitive? Where was this man's thesaurus??? And an aside, the dustcover... The review from Newsday ""[McCurty]is one of the few male authors who can write convincingly from the woman's point of view."" RUBBISH! On the contrary, his female characters are demeaning representations -insulting and unconvincing. This book is nonsense - a waste of time. Did I mention repetitive?"
1,Can someone say quota?,"Ok,as a Larry McMurtry fan, I just got done with his trilogy about Thalia. Wonderful stories. Of course I read Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment, and all of his classics.This book sucked. First of all, it was weirdly sexual, pointless, and the themes were just a bad copy of the good books he's written. This is the worst book he has ever written, and no one should read it. It was just a pointless story that was obviously his last book he needed to fill his quota to his publisher."
3,Cat vs. Cat,"When you have more than one, this is a great book to have on hand. I have four and each with a different personality. I would definitely recommend this book."
3,Your cats may throw a monkey wrench into this advice,"Put me midway between those praising this book for its valid observations (how cats determine their heirarchy) and those disparaging it for its suggestions that would indeed chew up most of your spare time.I eagerly sought out this book to explain why our older cat, Casey, disliked our younger cat, Olivia. Well, there is an incredibly tedious description on how to introduce new cats to each other involving many days of separation and gradual contact. This may be valid in part but I really think kittens and young cats drive dowagers crazy no matter what you do.When we next bought baby Hanno home, he and Olivia hissed at each other for one day and then began best play buddies. Casey is allowed to retire to her favorite blanket in relative peace while the ""young people"" wrestle and romp.Do read this book but realize it may not solve personality problems or conflicts when one cat has vastly higher energy than another."
4,Cat Vs. Cat: Keeping Peace When You Have More Than One Cat.,This book has a heck of a lot of information on cats. If you think you know about felines - think again! Read and learn! This book will help you become a better guardian and your cats will benefit.
2,Don't bother-FOR BEGINNER CAT OWNERS ONLY,"I have two adult female cats who don't like each other. This book didn't give me any new ideas about how to overcome this problem, and for anyone who knows their pets well, this is a complete waste of money. What REALLY irritated me is that there was a section devoted to male-male aggression but nothing about female-female or male-female problems!!There were so many glaring omissions about basic cat ""body language"" and behavior, that I became more annoyed the more I read. I was VERY disappointed."
5,Excellent club song!!!,"The original mix version of Sandstorm is one of the best songs of the year. The beat is extremely catchy. Sandstorm is a must play at any major party or club. And if you like this one, wait until you hear Feel the Beat by Darude. Uses the same beat, but slows down in the middle to a hip-hop beat, then speeds back up to end it."
5,replacement saw blade,"I needed a new metal cutting saw blade for a Panasonic metal cutting saw. I was unable to find one locally after trying 6-7 stores. So I went on line to Amazon.com found the right blade and ordered one. The blade even with shipping, cost me about 50% less than the last one I was able to buy locally about 3 years ago. This blade has performed well for me. I have had the saw for about 12 years and it does a fine job at metal cutting."
1,Total dissapointment,I couldn't even get it to work. Totally dissapointed. But I send it back and got my money back to my account in to time. Thank you Amazon.
5,Clean Cutter,This blade cuts clean! I replaced a 24 tooth blade with this one. The difference is incredible. I used this blade mostly for cutting plywood panels for cabinetry. I couldn't be more pleased.
5,"Wow, it's amazing....","I purchased this blade for my elderly Skilsaw. I have a very small shop and have to cut sheet goods outside, under the carport, before I can get them into my basement shop. I've always had to cut my piece's oversized and then trim them on the table saw to get nice finished edges, but this blade gives me a nice finished edge without the extra steps. I have used it on Oak veneer ply and melamine sheets and the chip out is very, very minimal and stalling and binding are non existant. I understand that the teflon coated version of this blade is even better. I find that hard to believe as this little blade is simply amazing. This is the third Freud saw blade I have purchased and they all perform beyond my expectations. I also use Freud blades on my table saw and miter saw. I highly recommend this blade to anyone needing nice cuts with a small saw."
4,I miss the real raves,"so many good memories, this is a good album just like only for the headstrong vol.1"
2,"Heartwarming, but...","Although this is an inspiring and well-written piece of literature, the fact is that, even though Balto took the medicine 53 miles, his was the last leg of the relay. There were other teams of dogs who traveled farther and longer than Balto's team, and they received none of the credit afterwards. I suppose it's the politics of heroism, which is sad, but they should still be acknowledged for having gotten the medicine far enough for Balto to see it delivered safely to the sick people."
3,Not as pictured,The description for this item says that it holds four UMDs. The photo shows six in the package. It does only come with four in the package. Too expensive for only four holders!
3,Interesting Read,My least favorite of the trilogy. Still worth reading if you really love the Kovacs world built in the 1st book.
4,"Great mix of politics, violence and archaeology","When I read Altered Carbon, I remember thinking hmm ... I'd really like to read about Takeshi Kovacs (the ""hero"") and his war buddies ... lo and behold, that's pretty much what you get in Broken Angels, along with alien tech, future politics, and plenty o' action, both real world and virtual. More of a ""straight"" SF novel than the first Kovacs, which I prefer. Plus, I love the quirky quasi-Marxist political slant native to British writers like Morgan, Ken MacLeod and Iain M. Banks (OK, so the last two are Scots), and I never fail to be amused at the ire it provokes in American readers steeped in Heinleinisms. So yeah, bring on Takeshi Kovacs #3!!"
5,"Low fat, high taste Ginger Snaps","My son loves these cookies, so I buy them in bulk and store in the freezer. They have a great taste, are low in fat....something he needs with his Crohn's disease...and very tasty. I am so glad to have a cookie that is gluten free and yummy. They are a bit fragile compared to regular ginger snaps (that could be used to open locked doors!!), but any crumbled ones are good in parfaits with yogurt or pudding, or as pie crust."
1,not fresh..,Disappointment...these cookies have a stale taste unlike when I buy them from the Health Food Store.
4,"Great quality, lacking content","I read the Arabic book on which this film is based, and so was looking forward to watching the film. The quality of this product, as well as the artistic production of the film were fantastic. However, the alterations made to the plot were unimpressive, and the lack of character development was disappointing. Also, the film is exhaustingly and unnecessarily long. Still, a good buy overall."
5,Lexar Media 1GB Memory Card,This card was a good replacement for the original card which came with a recent camera purchase. The 1GB memory lets you take a multitude of photos without stopping. It was a great asset to my camera purchase. I would recommend the product to anyone.
1,"Hoped for a bargain, got a dud","I had high hopes for this bargain-priced 1GB SD card, which I purchased to use w/ my flash-based MP3 player. Unfortunately, the card doesn't work properly. Once I write the music files to the card (a VERY slow process, taking about 10 minutes to write the entire card, given the turtle-like write speeds), my player doesn't see about half of the tracks/albums. I've tried emptying and rewriting the card multiple times, as well pulling all of the tracks out of their album directories and writing them to a single, top-level directory, all for naught. I can't discern any rhyme or reason as to what it recognizes and what it doesn't, which changes each time I rewrite the files. I also have twice run into mysterious errors (""Cannot create file or directory"") while trying to write to the empty card. I'm stymied, and will be returning the card."
3,"No, not this one","This is not the one you want to get. You want the Lexar 1 GB 32X SD card. They look the same, except for the ""32X"" designation."
4,I'm not a fan of the show.,"This was a gift for my boyfriend, along with the other three volumes of the series. This is the most expensive of all Utraman Tiga volumes due to the fact that it was very under-produced. The other volumes are much cheaper, and this site is the cheapest way to buy this volume to date. Try searching elsewhere for the other three, you can find them for fairly cheap prices."
5,love it!,my guineas are pretty big and they fit in here they love it! Just make sure you have a big enough cage or use this outside there cage for play time I used the yellow supperrr soft bedding on top of my bunnies hide away house since they cuddle up together there to sleep!
1,I don't know about Aristotle . . .,. . . but Plato would have hated this book and it's obvious marketing ploy.
4,Almost commercial techno-industrial-dance,"If techno-industrial went commercial, this would probably be what it sounded like. This isn't the most original music ever, but it is worth a listen. It's fun, and has a bit of energy in it. Also, there are two Download remixes on here, but IMO, they aren't worth listening to. They are, believe it or not, the weakest songs on this album. Try it out, you might like it!"
2,disappointing,"well for me avp is an like a hobby, u can say im obsest(sp).well seeing this movie was being made was just freakin awsome, waiting 6 years for this film i could not wait anymore.so i went to wal mart to pick up this avp book, read 1 chapter, good,2 was good. i could not put this book down it was suspenceful. towards the end it began to get stupid like this one part when the girl and the pred r working together, he starts to take off his armor cuz it was burning from acid and she says ""woh slow down there tiger"" come on. well i did not finsh the end so when i see the film i would know who wins. i was very disappointed but i hope that the writer is a bad well writer. but the film still looks good ps go preds"
4,Remember the Alamo...,"I happened to read an article about Sarah Bird in the Austin American Statesman and it mentioned the re-release of three of her books. After reading brief descriptions of them, I ran out and bought them. Alamo House is a scream. It's an easy and quick read making you feel as if you, too, live right there in Alamo House with Mary Jo, Fayrene and Collie. I can't wait to pass my copy on to my friends who attended the University of Texas."
4,Books that changed the world,"This is a well-written, interesting overview of books that have made a direct impact on events, or that have deeply influenced people's minds over time. The author, Robert B Downs, a distinguished librarian, is a credible and persuasive commentator. Simply reading the book from cover to cover constitutes a liberal education."
3,Greatest European-heritage books,"Regrettably, the neither Quran nor any other non-European heritage book was considered within the top fifty or so, no matter how many readers it may have had or lives it may have touched. Makes me wonder is ""all men (people) are created equal still refers only to whites. Now, maybe if this good enough list were re-named, so as not to be taken as universal... ?"
5,Get this one while it's still a bargain...,"It seems like the other 2 CDs by this artist are now almost twice what this one costs. And I think this one's the best of the lot. It's got a real swanky lounge sound and all the newest hip music that's out there. I say pick it up before the price doubles. I especially like ""Yachts,"" but I'm sure you'll find something to cherish about this."
2,"Not as good as 6,5,4,2","I started buying Hotel Costes backwards starting from 6,5,4,then 2. Then I bought 3 and 1 and those two just wasn't as good as the others. Some what disappointed. At least know I know his newer ones are getting better and not worst, right?"
4,Le-no-no Music,"This book is a good look at what were to be the last days of Messr. Lennon. Mostly because it is told with a real writer's understanding of the travails of everyday life - Not with the Giuliano lack of imaginative space. It's not a great book because the subject matter itself cannot be elevated to ""greatness."" But Rosen seems to know how to shape the facts, materials, stories, etc., into, at least, a human-sized story - - his is the type of sympathetic psyche Lennon probably would have appreciated at the time."
5,An excellent read- especially for young women today,"I was lucky enough to come upon this book this summer. It immediately brought me back to my own college days in Boston. While mine were in the 90's and my field was painting rather than science, I couldn't get over the similarities and parallels between 1960's Boston and 1990's Boston.I could relate personally to many of the characters and situations, particularly Bronwyn's up and down moments of confidence and insecurity.It was an excellent read and I devoured the book in just a few sittings.My only complaint is that the writer has invented a lovably flawed character who loves Dunkin Donuts so much that his laments about them triggered cravings so intense I nearly hopped on a plane to fulfill them. I am pregnant and living outside the USA where donuts are hard to come by."
2,One-sided and badly edited,"It is not the author's fault that the ""victory in Iraq"" which he often refers to turned out not to be that clear-cut. However, other shortcomings of the book are his responsibility. He is too much of a neo-con to write objectively. Furthermore, the book seems not to have been edited. His text is repetitive, his grammar is wrong at places, he refers to someone as Jong and then Yong three paragraphs later. Makes it hard to take its all-too-important points at face value."
2,hmmmm,"Very factual and a good concept overall. BUT the problem to me was that it was too factual, and not a good read. It was like reading a text book. On the other hand, if you are wanting to do a research paper on how the Nazis came to power, it has great information."
1,Tested and Failed,"I work in the AV department of a large marketing company. The company bought 5 of these DVD players to outfit the 5 different meeting rooms we have. 90% of all DVD's produced by the AV department have either paused during play, skipped, and/or not played in these DVD players. We have an older Sylvania that we have in the AV department, that plays these DVD's just fine, which lead me to believe that these players cannot play these type of discs. Nothing is more embarassing and nerve wracking than a DVD skipping or not playing when a client is watching. Thumbs down to this machine."
1,Going Down Hill Fast,I haven't had the system very long but as others have reported it occasionally skips and freezes on movies. Of interest is that the problem is the worst with my home movies but after I re-burn them using different burning S/W they seem to be okay. I could live with this but now when using the VCR side the picture started skipping (like my black and white TV did growing up). It's now gotten too bad to watch. I tried brand new high quality tapes and cleaning the heads with no luck. This has been the shortest lived VCR I've ever had.
2,Nice features but doesnt work well.,I normally have had good experience with Toshiba products but this combo DVD/VCR has not performed well. DVDs often freeze up. I have a Phillips DVD in another room and it always seems to have little trouble playing DVDs that have be freezing up in the Toshiba. It is nice to have the combo player although you will not be able to copy dvds onto tape due to copy protection.
4,Nice little unit,"I was shopping around for a vcr and a dvd player and considered individual units, combination units, combination with home theatre system units. This Toshiba made the most sense in terms of bang for the buck. So far the unit works great. The switchover from DVD to VCR is a bit clumsy but it works fine. If you are expecting a high end unit, go elsewhere, and don't buy a combined machine. If you are expecting good quality with a great price from a brand you can trust, this is a good unit. It has av jacks on the front for camera/game system, and digital audio and standard jacks on the back."
1,Not worth the money,"This unit would not play 90% of my DVD's. You would be watching the movie and all of a sudden it would just stop and freeze, then jump ahead anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes more into the movie. Other times all of a sudden the top half of the screen would go black and the bottom half would be a mumble, jumble of pixels. I tried hooking it up to two other different brands of TV's in my house and it did the same on all of them. I wouldn't recommend this combo to a dead dog. Needless to say I returned it and exchanged it for a different make."
2,Consider another brand,"I wish I could get my money back! After the third use of the DVD, the rented dvd got stuck in the unit. I had to return the unit to the manufacturer (I had to insist that they pay for shipping), and was promised a new unit. During the one month I waited for a replacement, calls to customer service were fruitless. Timer recording on the vcr and ejecting a tape is a two-step process; too complicated compared to my other three VCRs. Buttons on the remote are too small and the lettering is even smaller! Will never buy another Toshiba product based on poor customer service performance!"
1,One year later......,"While watching a movie in the VCR I can see the bleedthroughfrom the channel it happens to be on. Would never purchaseanother toshiba product, ever..."
1,DVD player can't get through a movie without skipping!,"The DVD player in this product will not get through a movie without freezing and skipping through the entire thing. I tried to play a 20 minute Pilates DVD and it wasn't finished until 35 minutes later because of all the stopping. It's infuriating! I wish I could get my money back, but now I'll just have to trash it and buy another. Don't buy this product!"
1,Died after a year and a half,"Very disappointing. I've been a loyal Toshiba customer and used the machine, but did not overuse it, and cleaned the heads regularly and one night, barely a year and a half after purchase it just died. The cost of repair was not worth the investment and it was well past the warranty so I discarded it. It's a shame, I liked Toshiba products but I don't plan to buy another one now."
1,I give up,"I have two Toshiba TVs that are great. I also have two of these players. They both do not record on tape. When I first got them, they would only record on fast speed and only play back on the same recorder. Now nothing. Last night, while playing a DVD, one of them paused for a few minutes every few minutes, and is doing it now. I have a Sony DVD recorder w/ hardrive, #500. thats great. The Toshibas are going to the dump. I shoud have paid more money the first time. Thanks for reading this review."
5,Simply Amazing!,"Burlap to Cashmere is one of the most unique groups I have ever heard. They combine american folk, latin, african, greek, and modern rock to produce their style of music. Their lead guitarist (John) is THE BEST guitarist I have ever heard, trust me this cd is worth the money. and while you are buying this cdBUY JARS OF CLAY!"
2,Two good songs,"I've had many of this type of CDs in the past. The ones you buy because of a song you like. I thought this would be different though because of the outstanding quality of the one song I knew, ""Treasures in Heaven"". The final song ""Mansions"" is also solid. Maybe it is just me, but best I could get from this title is two songs. You may think differently."
3,Entertaining early disco,"Despite the opinion of my grumpy fellow reviewer (who has some point, I suppose), if you want to know more about this CD than the one track, read on. This is a pretty decent collection of early-era disco, melodic and fun. ""Rock the Boat"" is a classic. ""Rockin' Soul"" was a sizeable hit, even if it sound way too similar to ""Rock the Boat"". ""Freedom for the Stallion"" is likewise pretty good. One chart entry (""I Caught Your Act"") is missing, but what's here is entertaining, if nothing terribly special."
4,Inexpensive PSP solution,"This travel package helps you to connect your PSP to PC, recharge it (At home or in the car), listen to it via headphones and also provides a small bag to keep all these things and also the PSP itself. Not bad. Quality... Not the highest in the world but not too bad either."
2,not horrible...,"This CD would seem fantastic, featuring all of the James Bond title songs. The only problem is that they are not the original songs (sung by Shirley Bassey, etc.). They are bad quality remakes with singers I've never even heard of. But the second disc makes up for it with acceptable instrumental versions of the famous songs. Worth buying? That's up to you, if you want the original songs or not."
4,"A fun, easy to follow workout","This is a good, short workout with a little bit of toning. I definitely feel it more in my legs than arms though. I also wish there was some ab workout included. If you are already in pretty good shape the toning portion probably will not do much for you but it's still a good walking workout."
2,Disappointed,"I am a great fan of Evan S. Connell's Son of the Morning Star, which I consider the finest work of American Military History ever written. This led me to read this book (historical novel?) on the panorama of the 12th century crusades. The tone and scope take the view of a medieval narrator, which may have been an intriguing literary device, but the complexity of events, broad scope of characters, and multiplicity of details do not lend them selves well to this approach. Despite my moderate interest in this era and events, I bogged down at somewhere between 250 to 300 pages and I'm unlikely to move beyond this point."
5,An eye-openng dose of fanatacism,"This book is exactly what the cover promises. A chronicle of the crusades. Its chronicler is a fanatic Christian who recounts the names of people and events at a fairly rapid-fire rate.It's not for everyone. There is no plot, characters (per se) or dialog. Just a stripped-down history lesson told from the perspective of someone who lived in the era.I found it fascinating."
5,A true original,"Although this novel (if it is correct to call it a novel) is structured without the use of a traditional plotline or character development, I found it one of the most readable and interesting books of the year. Using the chronicle form, Evan Connell nonetheless achieves subtle characterizations and shadings in this history of the Crusades. The centerpiece around which these events takes place seems to be the portrayal of the rivalry of Richard Lionheart and Saladin, and the similarity of their religious zeal The book is like a great medieval painting or tapestry with hundreds of minor characters and depictions. Quite an original literary feat and one that Connell has pulled off with great success."
4,Melodic techno industrial music,"Razing Eden is not the hard-edged industrial rock of the more recent Luxt release, Chromasex Monkeydrive. Instead, this album blends techno and industrial styles with lush vocals and interesting lyrics. I found it to be an excellent disc overall; though their production has improved since Razing Eden, their music was near the height of sublime techno industrial brilliance with this release. Lies of Angels will always be one of my favorite songs, this album is one I can come back to again and again."
5,Macarthur NT Commentaries,I received this book as expected; it was on time and in the condition I expected. I recommend these NT commentaries for anyone interested in furthuring thier knowledge of God's truth. McArthur is a very gifted man.
2,Not so helpful,I was dissapointed with this book. It had great pictures and information about home repair but many of the subjects did not give any tips on how to do the repairs. For example tuck pointing bricks: The book showed examples of when it needed to be done but there was not one tip on how to do it.
3,Average,"This series just gets worse and worse as it goes on. I would love to point out all the points where the series chooses ridiculous directions and twists but I would have to ruin the story.Short and Sweet, if you're interested in reading something semi space opera'ish you can read this and when it starts getting annoying just put it down and know that the rest of the series just gets worse."
3,"OK, but not great","This book is an OK sci-fi space opera, but it lacks a tremendous amount of character development. If you're looking for Sci-Fi Channel, ""star wars"" style sci-fi then this book is for you. The first and last 50 or so pages are quite good, it's just plodding through the convoluted middle that makes the book difficult to read."
1,not what I expected,"I didn't like this book because science is not explained properly yes there's some very interesting ideas but I would have liked more explanation which is my main reason for reading SF. I found many of the characters boring and simplistic, characters I found interesting like Raymond ""King Peter"" didn't have enough space in this book, I didn't like the politics it's just too predictable and everyday like, im more of a ""serious"" SF reader and this read is starwars like -same author I was informed- I picked it up without that knowledge and honestly because I liked the cover, I give it a 1.5 out of 5"
2,Wake Me Up When It's Over,"Let me keep this brief and to the point, because that's exactly what this book is NOT.Each chapter jumps back and forth between different characters, on different planets, and there are a LOT of them. Many of them don't know each other and there is very little interaction, most of them are doing unintresting things. The action doesn't even begin until vary far into the book. Unfortunately, when it does finally begin, you're still trying to sort out all the characters. Who they are, how they feel about their fathers, where they like to frolic in the forest without shoes...etc...etc...etcThis book has an audience, I'm just not part of it. You may or may not be. If you like a very detailed story with many detailed characters, and you want to know every detail then you might like this book. If you like a story that gets off the ground in the first 200 pages, you will probably want to try something else.All in all I found it very snore-inducing, it could have been MUCH shorter."
2,"Good Plot, Bad Style Though","This book has a really good storyline, but I can't recommend it because of its, well, BAD style. Paragraphs are awkwardly structured, the pacing stumbles, aspects of the future-society are introduced in spurts, the descriptions are robotic, cliche's of plot and sentence abound, and the characters are a bit bland."
1,Nothing!,"Past the novelty of stealing half their name from the most popular band in the world, this collage/sample project has absolutely no listening value. I've heard better stuff from elementary school children playing with a tape recorder. And I'm giving credit where it is due..."
2,Pithy but bland,The Radical Leap turns out to be nothing of the sort. It's the same old story told a slightly different way - the dialog seems to be taken from a Nickelodeon TV sitcom episode than a serious business book.
4,Surfin' to Success,"I read this book with my own organization's challenges in mind. The concepts seemed perfect in symetry and sharply delivered. The only reason I'm holding back the fifth star is because his insertions of setting descriptions and flavor were somewhat ""off"" in their delivery and a bit ""forced."" Still, the book has a powerful message and can be read in an afternoon."
2,"Great concepts, crap story...","Hooray...another acronym based leadership book!Concepts: Trust, Integrity, love your job, set incredibly high goals and get creative, stand up for what is right, be audacious.The Book: Contrived, silly plot, bad dialogue, ridiculous one dimensional characters, see-thru epiphanies and a completely unnecessary and unhelpful background mystery plot twist thingy. Oh did I mention the ridiculous characters?Pass on this one...and all the rest of the series."
3,Can Construction Take the Leap,"In the rough and tumble world of heavy civil construction using phrases like ""cultivate love"" and ""inspire audacity"" require some imagination to keep people involved. This book was very entertaining, reading rather like a novel that shows you how to take leadership to the real world. I am now a disciple of ""13 pages"". Many managers can ""run"" jobs but few can really lead.Read this book and you are on your way to knowing what leadership is about."
5,Great insights - inspiring story,"This is an inspiring film. Temple Grandin, though autistic, was awarded a doctor's degree. She credits her Mom and others who took time and interest in her. Well acted. Loved the movie. Gave it away as Christmas gifts to the significant people in my life.Dorris M. Schulz, Ph.D.Director for Missionary CareMissions Resource Network"
5,An amazing amount of insight on autism.,"My husband and I watched this movie last night for the first time. We are as different as night and day but this movie had both of us riveted from beginning to end. It opens up the door to a wealth of insight on autism. Once I finished the movie I did some internet research on Temple Grandin and was blown away at how one person's life experiences can have such an impact in the world. I am so excited to share this movie with my children. It will be one more teaching tool to show them how important it is to embrace all people simply because they are people. As Temple's mother is quoted in the movie as saying, ""She is different, not less."" What a great life lesson to pass on to both young and old in this world."
2,THAT DANES WOMAN,SAW THIS ON SKY. PURCHASED COPY. NOT PLAYABLE ON MY MACHINE. NEED RETURN ADDRESS AS END OF DAYS. SAME REASONS ETC.
5,great movie,"I highly recommend this movie. Although not typical Hollywood fare, it is a wonderfully acted, sensitive portrayal of an extraordinary individual."
5,A Story Well Worth Pondering,"College students studying a unit on autism pointed me toward this movie. Dr. Grandin has much to teach, not only about living with autism, but about the value of family, the role of a committed mentor, and the increasingly rare value of courage. Viewers from all walks of life can learn much from ""Temple Grandin."""
5,On my favorites list for sure,"Excellent. One of the best movies I've ever seen. No need for special effects, just tell the story of a special person. There are a lot of neuro typicals out there who'll never contribute one iota to society even though they are normal. Good thing not every one is ""normal""."
4,4 1/2 stars for a well acted bio flick,"Sometimes I forget, HBO makes some of the best entertainment available anywhere. This is one of those. Claire Danes gives a remarkable performance as Temple, an autistic woman who has become a professor of animal husbandry at the University of Colorado (I think). Her journey which starts here in high school, shows how determination, a unique intelligence and a mother's refusal to let her daughter be minimized has been an inspiration for many with similar afflictions. Granted, there are scenes difficult to watch, but for the most part this is an uplifting story of some special people and certainly worthy of the Emmy awards the movie received."
4,"Awesome, but I wish there was more information!","If you've ever met Temple Grandin, you could see what a fantastic acting performance Claire Danes gives in this movie. If you close your eyes, you would swear she is the real person! That being said, the movie left me wanting more. More about Temple's childhood and her family background. More about how Temple sees the world, and how the world sees her. Yes, there is information about how the ranchers didn't want her around, but only because she was a woman! Temple achieved so much and against great obstacles, so you want to know EVERYTHING about how she did it! Definitely a movie to buy and watch many times."
4,Temple Grandin,"For those of us with a child on the Autism Spectrum, this movie gives us hope. I am amazed at her accomplishments and can only hope that our son does half as well. There are days I think about giving up, but if there is anything that he can do to support himself in the future, I want to help him reach that goal. I want to be like Temple's mother."
2,just ok,The colors of the beads are not as bright and vibrant as pictured. I would not recommend this to a friend the beads look old and not in a vintage way
3,Beads for jewelry,Found the actual thread with pusher to be too short to pass through the beads/ Difficult to use for a child.
3,moderately interesting,"My kids played with this for about an hour, left the pieces scattered and have not worn the jewelery or come back to it."
2,"Decent, but poorly designed","This is a pretty good toy, and lots of fun for a three-year old, but the showcase items, the butterflies, are too wide for the string! What this means is that the string to put through the beads has a stiff plastic coating on the ends about an inch long to help push through the beads. However, the butterflies are longer than the plastic segment, meaning you cannot push the string through. The solution is to find something small and pointed, such as a jewelers screwdriver or a safety pin, to get it all the way through. Needless to say, this is a little time-consuming for both parent and kid, as well as meaning that kids cannot solve this safely on their own."
5,Love this book!,"This is a great book full of humor as well as practical wisdom for any mom, or even those with friends who are moms!"
1,Horrifying Euro-pop,"This is a great CD- if you are into eurotrash club pop. It lacks the sophistication of ToT's earlier albums. If you are a fan of Aegis and Velvet Darkness They Fear, this album is not for you."
2,Yawn,"The premise of this film as indicated on the jacket is impossibly vague; it is described rather unhelpfully as an exploration of ""love"" and ""generosity of spirit"" and so forth. Once you see the video, you will understand that the film itself is so unfocused that there really is no adequate way to describe it. One might think of it as a patchwork of ideas that were spewed out during a brainstorm by first-year film students over Sunday brunch. There isn't a great deal of intelligence behind this production."
1,Something smells fishy,"I ordered this product because it is a ""wet-to-dry"" flat iron, instead today I recieved one that is ""wet-or-dry"". In addition, mine doesn't look anything like the picture. I would give them a piece of my mind except it's Thanksgiving tomorrow. So beware buyers."
4,Nice product,I got this as a gift for my wife. She's very happy with it. Thanks for all the efforts...
1,Livin' La Vida Broka,"Boy, this guy sure is a flop. Talk about a total flash-in-the-pan...One minute he's on top of the world, the next minute he's ""livin' la vida broka!!!"" I've heard this record, and it totally lacks soul and flair. Maybe this loser should get back with his boyz from Menudo - at least they had good songs!!The only worthwhile tune on this record is ""Nobody Wants to be Lonely,"" and even that is a little disappointing since it doesn't have goddess Christina Aguilera on it.Oh well. This joker was bound to land with a dull thud sooner or later. For real Mexican rock, check out Frank Black or Los Huevos.ADIOS AMIGOS!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Another great series!,"Again, Jasper Fforde writes an excellent book, full of nursery rhyme characters that makes me feel as though I've been whisked away to another land. In this land, like Thursday Next (of his previous series), I can jump in and out of the storybooks of my youth. I love these books!Detective Jack Spratt and Mary Mary star in the start of this new series, where they are investigating the death of Humpty Dumpty. How cool is that?!"
5,I would have expected nothing less,"After reading Jasper Fford's first series about Thursday Next, I would have expected something as enjoyable as a Jack Spratt novel. Finally some fiction for intelligent people!"
4,"A really good, funny mystery!","I first became enthralled with Jasper Fforde through ""The Eyre Affair"" and have read all of this books. Resisted ""Over Easy"" at first since I am not a big fan on mysteries or children's books. I surprisingly loved it and didn't want to put it down. Cannot wait to read ""The Fourth Bear."" And I loved this book because it was almost as round as Karl Pilkington's head. But much funnier."
3,clever but overwrought,"This is a clever book but a bit tiring. Reading THE BIG OVER EASY makes one wonder at just how hard Fforde works at all the puns and wordplay, so that the reader is overly aware of the author's style. Wacky is nice, self-conscious styling is boring."
3,color cartridge,The item came in wrong package. Item is working but the green color is not printing well when I printed trees. The company respondedly in a timely fashion.
1,Get what you pay for.,"The HP 23 Tri-color Ink Cartridge shipped very quickly, but the product did not function correctly. There was no blue ink in the unit. I contacted the seller but got no response. I will contact the seller again today to give them another chance to make it right."
1,This product does not work!,"This product did not work when put into the printer. I went through the process of alignment, cleaning and priming to no avail."
1,So disappointing!,"I bought this CD thinking it would be an authentic sound from the period, instead it's a heap of modern day crap playing pieces from the era but with electronic organ etc. Yuck. Forget it, go for another CD... there are better ones including the ""I salonisti"" orchestra (the orchestra featured on the movie soundtrack). Two thumbs down and one in the throat!"
2,Sucked,I guess for the price this is what I should have expected. It was cheap plastic material. And the shoulders were so wide on it. Didn't even use it. I ended up buying a new one.
4,Very good and almost unknown Russian music,"The canon of Russian Romantic classical music is so large that it is almost impossible for one person to listen to it all. But trying sure has its rewards, and this is one of them. I found this CD by browsing thru lists of Russian composers, and listened to it on a whim. I am glad I did. These two symphonies are probably the only two works by Kalinnikov that is available online, and they show a musical genuis. Both works are wonderful symphonies encompassing various moods, melodies, and harmonies. Both extend upon the Internationalist tradition begun by Tchaikovsky and are quite enjoyable to listen to. I highly recommend it."
2,"Charming symponies, good performance though the Chandos...",Two great symphonies that should be a part of the repertoire of every orchestra.The Naxos performance is good but it is no match for the Jarvi performance on Chandos with the RSNO. That disc is worth the extra outlay given that the quality of the performance and the sound are so much superior. Thankfully Chandos has released the two symphonies on one disc in the last year.
4,"Nice player, poor headphones","The cd player sounds good and it pulls in all the radio stations I listen to, but the headphones that came with it are down right painful.March 2002. This player has gotten almost daily use since June and it's held up well. I was skeptical about the hinge, but it's still together after being dropped a couple times. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the headphones, I wouldn't still be using the player if I hadn't replaced the headphones."
1,Micro Mosquito RC Helo Review!,"This was the single most 'bitchen' toy ever. I flew it all over my house, up the stairs, across the landing, and then across my living room to land on the dining room table. I had so much fun I couldn't believe how great it was... Then I bought one for my nephew that didn't work. Then I bought another one for myself, and one for a friend: neither worked! ... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. You will not get one that functions properly. They are now on Version 3. This helo should go up, down, left, right, forward, and backward. Is a little quality assurance too much to ask?"
1,"stay away from this model, very bad quality","I got this model from Fry's Electronic for $20 bucks (they had it on sale a while ago). Any way, the first one was broken within 2 days. One of the motors was dead. I think it's because the motor is too small and weak to spin the rotor for 5 to 10 minutes. I went back and exchanged for a second one. However, the second one had issue with charging unit not connecting to the helicopter properly and so I couldn't charge it. I exchanged again for a 3rd one. Again, the same motor went dead within 2 days. Finally, I went back to Frys and got my money back. I didn't care much about the 20 bucks but it was nice that Frys was willing to take it back, no question asked!Bottom line, don't waste time and money on this one. If you must, get it from Frys. At least, you can exchange for a few times 8)"
1,Junk! Spoiled right out of the box,"This was BAD! What disappointed children!! The copter NEVER took off, plug in charge port wobbly, even the micro screw driver that came with this thing did not fit the screws. Remote totally defective...does not work at all. Antenna fell right out of remote...horrible quiality. Gets a big ZERO from me."
3,it'll do...,"Lets start with the case; IT IS ABSOLUTE JUNK!!! I had read the reviews but figured everyone else was super sinical. Those socket sets that cost $2.99 come in a better case, PERIOD. But, i would not keep the case even if it were steel and here's why. In order to fit everything in the case you have to attach the trimmer to the plunge base. For those of you who use the plunge base primarily this probably be a huge problem.I also own the porter cable trimmer and as far as I am concerned the to compare equally when attached to the basic trimmer base. This trimmer will do anything my porter cable trimmer will do. would I buy it again, yes."
4,A MUST FOR THOSE LONG RUNS,"Trained for a marathon with this radio. Found no receptionproblems outdoors in Philadelphia area (does not work indoors). Greatvalue for the radio features, but forget about the stop watch. All the serious runners I know have a special wrist watch for this purpose anyway, so it's redundant. END"
1,Don't buy this,"This was a terrible purchase for me. The reception is bad, the sound is not clear and my belt clip broke after three months. If you are active and need your clip, or if you want to hear and enjoy what is being played on the radio - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
5,oldies cd,Loved the music.Brought back old memories.Arrived within alloted time and was as described.Will buy from again.
4,Mondo Grosso: A definite Buy,"I originally bought this CD from a recommendation from a DJ at a local Atlanta radio station. After hearing. ""Now You Know Better"" featuring Amel Larrieux I was hooked.This CD offeres some of the most ecclectic sounds around. mondo Grosso is a group with lots of experience and it shows on this work. Songs to pay particular attention to include the uptempo ""Butterfly"" and ""Life"" featuring Paula Lima. They are what I call ""happy songs"" and offer a really beautiful relief to some of the sounds out know. Also, the ""Star Suite"" sequences remind me of being a child and coming into my own as a young adult."
5,great product and fast delivery,"my new strings from amazon are the greatest,and for a reasonable price and fast delivery..Thanks amazom."
5,Couldn't put it down for a second!,This story was an awesome read. I've really enjoyed this author's past work and with Like a Hurricane she shows that she can write anything and do a fantastic job.
1,Poorly packed,"Poor packaging caused the pieces to arrive broken. Didn't even get a chance to put it together. Pity, it looked nice. Applied for a refund. I'll buy something locally."
5,great book for men and women,"book opens up minds to how falsely doctrined women became the curse of the fall and reason for all problems in the world. Just maybe it was the Plan of God all along for Adam (as both were named as one), or Eve to figure Gods desire out for them and make her Choice to fall???"
5,"Fun, exciting, gripping","A book about dancing rats. Doesn't sound like a sure-fire winner, does it? But this tale of perserverance and determination makes a wonderful and gripping read. The fantasy rat world is only half the story--the other half is the fascinating account of the hard work, training, and innovation of the dance troupe. By the time the Rattoons get to Rat Hollow, you know how very hard they've worked, and you're rooting for their success. Not only was this a fun read, but it was an interesting and eye-opening look at the work that professional dancers put in before they're ready for the Boom-Boom Room."
3,Sesame St fun laptop,"I bought this for a 2 1/2 year old as a birthday gift. He hasn't had it long but loves it! It's easy enough for him to be able to play with it by himself so makes him feel pretty ""big""."
1,The most annoying toy ever,"I love elmo.I hate this toy.....with a passion.Bottom line, the buttons on this have the ability to be repeatedly pressed over and over and over in rapid succession and the result is something out of a horror movie."
2,Not What I Expected,"I thought I was getting an insect encyclopedia, but it was actually a paperback book of poems about insects. The illustrations were watercolor paintings on primed brown paper bags with collage. My little granddaughter was not thrilled. I guess I should have read the reviews, first!"
2,Cheaply made,"The frame is very cheaply made. The corners are stapled together. As soon as I put the picture in and stood it up, one of the corners came completely apart. I have a stapler that does thick paper and was able to staple the corner back together. It's just for a document so I am not going to waste my time returning."
5,Excellent!,"This book was extremely helpful to me in a difficult time in my life. I highly recommend it to anyone who is living under the terrible dark cloud of low self esteem, whether brought on by divorce or other major events, or by harms suffered in childhood from unfeeling parents or others. The author really appears to understand, and offers a kind and loving help for getting out from under that cloud and into the sunshine. It is filled with kindness and compassion, and will help you on your way to finding happiness again."
5,I found it to be very helpful and encouraging.,This book helped me to see why we burden ourselves with so many things to do even when we don't want to. We were brought up to be nice and please everyone; not being able to say no without feeling guilty. I wrote to Sue after reading this book and thanked her for sharing such good information.
1,Bad Book!,"Do you believe in child abuse, lying, cruelty to animals? Then by all means read this book. If not, stay away from a very bad book. I was so upset that this book targets 9-12 year olds I could not even finish it. It was bad enough when the father ""smacked"" his daughter, then later almost killed her with his shotgun while killing squirrels, but then in both instances he ""neglects"" to tell his wife. What on earth kind of message does this send to children?! While the premise of the book may well have value, the presentation of such incidents without a word of condemnation for such acts was disgusting. This book should not be read by children; it will give them a very wrong view of right and wrong!"
3,Good Delivery Time,I needed the book for school and I received it in ample time to read the first chapter prior to the beginning of the first class. Thanks!
1,Accomplishes its mission,"The title says it all. This CD does pull out all the stops in the schlock and saccharine department. It would get even less if they included 'I've Never Been to Me' by Charlene, one of the worst songs of all time. I guess a one star review for this collection is a thumbs up, right? P.S. I would NEVER own this CD, but I've heard all the songs here, which is more than enough."
5,Brotherly Love,"When David first sees his newborn brother Matthew attached to a support system, he is initially shocked. Matthew's slow development requires him to remain in the hospital for an extended period of time.David gives clarity, voice and reason for siblings of people with special needs. One can feel his sadness and resentment when his party is pre-empted because of his brother's vast needs; one cringes with him when Matthew unwittingly embarrasses him. David does not pretend all is sunshine and roses; despite his concern and resentment, there is the underlying brotherly love. He naturally feels protective of Matthew and in so doing, forms a bond with his brother that is truly heartwarming indeed.This is an excellent book for families and educators. In fact, this book is really for everbody and is a good bonding as well as teaching tool. Readers of all ages will be able to relate to David's feelings and see how he and his brother flourish."
5,"""To Sleep With Anger""","This is the best movie that Danny Glover made, it shows that when things are going well, something or someone that you open your home or life to will bring evil into your home. Never go to sleep in or on anger."
4,Dr. Diablo is Waiting for you...,"Here's another macabre anthology from Amicus Studios (penned by ""Psycho"" novel author Robert Bloch who also wrote the anthology film ""Asylum"") that is worth a look if only for Jack Palance's unusual performance in the fourth tale. He is at times quizzical, gentle, manic, sublime, refined, and demented. He is all over the place, and it is refreshing to see him let it all hang out. He must have really enjoyed this, because it shows. Pairing him with the great Peter Cushing was a stroke of brilliance. They are both elegant and at the same time edgy and a bit odd.Being a collector myself (for collecting is at the heart of the Palance/Cushing story), this dvd makes a wonderful addition to my shelf of horror movies."
2,You get what you pay for,The gloves I recieved had yarn sticking out from 3 out of the 5 fingers on each glove. Within two weeks it started to become undone and the strings got caught on things.For the amount I paid I guess I got what I paid for.
3,I'm Just Picky,"All in all it's actually a good book encompassing the entire state of Colorado for the average tourist. I ordered the book thinking there'd be more varied info on day trip ideas from Denver than what you can find in any tour book. I also worry about it being outdated, especially regarding restaurants; it was published in 2001; a dozen years ago. It's also quite heavy!If you're looking for a good overview of the state, it would be good."
5,Very good reference for microbiology,"I studied this book for my undergraduate microbiology class. It helped because it got to the point was nice and concise. It focused on some important topics. It is easy to understand and keeps your attention. I also used the following which is on amazon:Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick LeonardiThe latter book was very good and a must buy because it helped me to get very good grades on my microbiology tests. Plus, it helped to eliminate some of the surprise questions that my teacher through on the test. I would defintely recommend both books for any undergraduate student taking a microbiology class. Both books are 5 stars."
2,Ironfire,"Unlike other reviewers, I couldn't finish this one -- the main problem for me was the sentence-level writing, which seemed amateurish and clunky. Although events in the plot occurred rapidly, a lack of mood meant that my interest wasn't grabbed. I don't recommend it."
3,Entertaining but Trivial,"Given all of the garbage fiction published annually, this book is an entertaining read. Good for long flights and lonely hotel nights and beach vacations. However, not a scholarly pursuit and certainly not very enlightening historically. Too many modern-day and ""politically"" correct perspectives (e.g., critical of the Inquisition and Catholic Church, only Islam is accepting of diversity, powerful and rich are assumed to be malevolent, etc.). All in all, OK but forgettable; am not compelled to read other works by author."
5,"Great show, great season",I love the CSI: NY Series and this season is no exception. There are new dynamics with each character and the introduction of some important new ones.
5,a wonder supplement!,"i had to wait at least a month before i wrote a review, after all i wanted to feel the difference it made. ok here goes...i bought this after watching ""food matters"" you guys should all watch this documentary, and trust you me it made a big difference! i am way less lethargic - at 54yo you tend to be that way - more regular, and full of energy and i take exactly 6 tablets a day.i bought more of it and gave it to both my daughters and highly recommend it to anyone i encounter.a note about this brand NOW, it is the same if not better than all the fancy stuff out there, so why spend more?? i bought other products made by them and will continue to do so.here's to good health people and watch Food Matters!"
4,"OK, Needs Computer Animated Battle Scenes & Analyzation",Thorough but has a slightly out-of-date feel due to no computer animated battle scenes as seen on History Channel's programs of the ancient Greeks. The Spartan's cruelty to their slaves and rampant homosexuality in both sexes could have been analyzed through interviews with a couple of academics (along with some moderately strong comparisons to Nazi Germany). Doing this would have broken the monotony of constantly having the middle-aged actress explaining everything.An overall okay effort enchanced by the severe scarcity of productions about the Spartans.
5,enjoy it!,"As a hard core John Mayer fan, I enjoy this double CD set. I especially love ""Blues Intro"" and John's rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""Inner City Blues/Make Me Wanna Holler."" The rest is same ole, same ole, but the set is worth having if you love John playing the blues as much as I do. In concert, he does his old standards in all various ways, so no single one is ever the same. It's just fun to hear John in concert without actually being there. You can never go wrong with anything that has ""John Mayer Live"" in the subtitle."
1,Wasted Effort,"I can't fault the playing of the musicians or the production of this album. But I can fault the music itself, which is little short of plagarism: Capital of the World is a pale imitation of Ibert (Ports of Call), The Fifth Symphony shamelessly rips off Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony (with just a smidgen of Shostakovich), and Archipelago is a blatant copy of Milhaud's Le Bouef sur le Toit. Save your money for the originals."
1,Shipping is a joke,Shipping on this product is a joke. They advertise the unit for .05 cents each. If you buy one of them the shipping is around $8.00. I thought at .05 I'd order 100 of them. Shipping came to $600.00! Guess they really don't want to get rid of these. C'mon...stick 100 in a box and ship them to me for the $8.00. Stupid...
4,Excellent gadget,"I bought several of these for friends and family, and I kept my self a 1 GB one. I'm happy with it, fast transfer rates with USB 2.0 ports, very small and portable, and, best of all, very cheap.I did not give it 5 stars because the protective case does not fit tighlty on them, so if you are not careful, it may fall off and you can lose it (both cap and protective case). My wife already lost 1 cap after only two weeks of use.But on the other hand, I can agree with other reviewers in that the little thing is washer-machine safe, after my brother-in-law had his pass the laundry test, twice."
4,Good stuff - reliable and trustworthy,"Pros:1. Extremely small - will definitely make people go wow2. Have been using it for 4 months without any obvious problems3. Worked out of the box with Windows XP, Debian Sarge and Windows 98 (after downloading the driver)Cons:1. Grows a bit hot if you fill the disc completely or keep it plugged in for too long.2. Not specific to this model but copying 400MB will take more than 15 min.Technical information:Do remember 512MB is the raw space. Usable space is more like 500MB and if you exclude space for the software loaded on it then 490MB. But for the money it is a good bargain."
4,Great Device,"Fast and compact, the Cruzer Micro does what it's supposed to do. The blue LED glows brightly when it's operating and looks really sharp.I'd like to give it 5 stars, but the keychain clip is really small and it seems like it should be better thought out. Plus, it comes with a neck strap. Is anyone really going to wear this around their neck?There is some debate as to whether it's better to have the keychain clip on the USB device or the device's plastic cover. If it's on the device, as with this unit, and you attach it to your keychain, you likely won't leave it behind on a computer but you will likely lose the cap. If the keychain clip is on the cap, you won't lose the cap but you might leave the device behind somewhere."
5,small and compact,"I really do think this is a great product that they have made.it is really easy to just ""plug and play"". and it holds a lot of memory (512 MB!) and for the price, this is a really good flash drive"
2,laughable physics and dated graphics,"There are better bowling games out there if you actually enjoy real bowling. The graphics aren't terrible, but they are certainly outmoded. The physics in this game are simply terrible. The hook is not realistic, and the pins may as well be made out of lead for all the action generated by hitting them. Either that or the ball is made of sponge. In the real world i throw a hook and average 180, but in this game i throw a straight ball if i want to break 100."
1,Give Us This Day,"This was one of the worst war memoirs I have ever encountered.The writing is so sophomoric that I found myself wondering if theauthor was remembering actual events, or if he was confusing his pastwith a really bad war movie. The dialogue is idiotic and the writing is irritating (the author repeatedly observes and obsesses about one character brushing his hair back out of his eyes; this observation occurs about every three pages.)...."
4,Freud TK906 Blade,"Outstanding blade. Vary little vibration , with no or little sanding required. The slower you feed, the better the cut."
2,not what i expected from freud.,i always buy freud router bits i loved the very high quality of them. i figured that their saw blades were of the same quality. i put this blade on and it vibrated more then my stock sears blade. it also made my saw bog down more then my sears blade that was dull. the cut was no beter either. maybe frued makes good blades but this is not one of them. i guess you get what you pay for.
5,Baroque trumpet!,"Beautifully warm tones,recorded well,wonderful mastery of the baroque trumpet. I will buy other recordings this artist has played.Want to introduce others to Baroque music? This is one great example to share."
4,Wow...,"I heard this in the car of my friend's mom and I started cracking up. I'm only 14, but I thought this was hilarious. It's really great to hear humour that doesn't involve obsenities. I loved listening to it and wanted to hear it again. The only think that made me rate it down a star was that the audience laughed a lot so sometimes you couldn't hear what they were saying. It was hilarious, though!"
2,Kevin is a good salesman,"Folks... if you are like me, looking to improve your memory and get that promised ""Photographic memory"" skill, then don't buy this book. Too bad! I bought the whole kit for US $160.00. I have gone through the whole course, and did exactly what Kevin said. I was able to remember phone numbers, and other little things, but that was it. You must always keep repeating what you ought to remember often and if you lose the ""funny"" graphic images, you lost the info. The kit is more of a good salesmanship than a decent content. For the price I paid, it was not worth it."
5,Great comparative literature study,"Bullwhip Griffin is a great movie to watch after reading By the Great Horn Spoon! by Sid Fleischman with fourth graders. It gives students a wonderful opportunity to compare and contrast, as the movie is ""based on"" the book, but has taken many liberties. I highly recommend it!"
1,Fein Velcro Sanding Pad - Junk,The velcro on a recently used pad melted in less than 2 minutes. No bearing down with the 60 grit sandpaper was required. Fein has not fixed this defect even after many years of customer complaints.
2,Fein's credibility at risk,"It is difficult to comprehend Fein providing sanding pads and paper which are so useless. I have had the sandpaper/pads melt in sanding just a 3/4"" X 2"" area. Both the felt on the paper and the Velcro on the pad melted. I went through 20 sheets of paper to sand a close-quartered area. Whereas my B & D Megamouse did a 4-foot X 4-foot area with just one sheet. Both on the same project."
5,ease of use,"If you are like me and constantly changing sanding grits, the velcro is fantastic. No need to peel of the old one and have to discard it. This allows me to reuse the sandpaper and saves me money especially when I have very small jobs to do."
3,The serial thriller ends...finally.,"Following the revelations of the last volume, there isn't much to do except wait out the inevitable conclusion. And after it's all over, the first thought in my mind is, ""who cares?""This is a weak morality play by an author whose other work I've almost always enjoyed. Disappointing."
2,Felt that it was well written but not Stephen King,"Stephen, you have really let the loayal readers down on this one.I can't believee that you would let Coffey die without a fan fare. Youled us on a beautiful and well written trip just to let it fizzel in the end.I am very let down at the way this book ended, it could have been yetanother King classic, but alais it will forever sit on my shelf collecting dustbecause I have no desire to re-read it"
1,faking the funk,"Check that cover, man with a bunch of vultures and a lion this must be one super funky african band. With a total lack of information on anybody involved muscially and some very suspicious song titles, oh how clever the title of song seven is, this cd is some white boys' afro fantasy, fake funk all the way through. No african group has ever played music this stiff and unfunky. If you're looking for the real deal afro beat, you know ya gotta go with Fela, and forget this group of out of work rock musicians playing dress up."
3,"CIPA 45000, Universal Truck & Camper-Large, Low Mount Stainless","CIPA 45000, Universal Truck & Camper-Large, Low Mount StainlessI purchased two of these mirrors after running out of options looking for the factory ones. These mirrors seem well build and are all stainless with the exception of the screws. I installed these on a 1997 F350 with 'classic' body style. I really wanted to place over the mounting area of the old mirrors but that simply was not possible. Also, the angle of the door forced me to have to bend the upper unit and as a result the upper area is not level but angled up slightly in order to have the mirror in a level position. This reduces the total distance that the mirror can extend if you have extra wide trailers.I would recommend these simply because of the price and their availability. I have only had on vehicle for a few days so quality and durability will need to be rated after a period of time."
4,A reader,"I was disappointed by the decisions of the judges in the LaFlammes case. But the Melton case was different. The reader gets 2 different stories about 2 different scenarios. I was kind of thrown off by the irrelevant stories that shapiro had thrown in. That is the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars. It would have been a better read if the author would have just stuck to the point of the finalities and decisions of the stories instead of throwing in extra chapters that were kind of irrelevant to the other ones that actually had something to do with the cases mentioned.Other than that, great book"
2,Broken on arrival,The top for this cake stand is extremely thin and brittle plastic. It was already cracked when it arrived. If I had known how thin and cheaply made this stand was I wouldn't have purchased it.
1,Too flimsy.,"It was not very expensive, but too flimsy to consider using. It was leaning on arrival and it went back."
4,A double rolling rack is the only way to go!,"This double rack is fantastic! It rolls easily across tile or carpet, is sturdy, holds a ton of hung clothes. I use it to prepare for consignment sales. I will use the extended hanging arms at times, but never with much weight on them.In the off-season, when clothes are packed in bins to keep them clean, I will stack the bins on the rack -- they stack easily across the two bottom rails.The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars, instead of 5 stars, is that the top rails will sometimes pop up and out of the vertical poles. It doesn't happen often, and it is only when there is no weight on the top rails.This item is a must for anyone who works with a lot with hung clothing items! This has made my job easier and significantly more efficient. Don't waste your money on a single rail rack! This is the one to get!"
2,Disappointed,Don't use this blade in cold temperatures. I had it shatter around the arbor the first time that I used it. I have not had this experience with their other blades.
5,Mind blowing,Low budget psychological thriller which kept me intrigued from start til end. superb characters and a twisted plot. some really creative dialogue and amazing sound track of music. well worth watching
5,An excellent book,"This book covers a difficult topic with detail, logic an openness, and really makes you think!"
3,Faith and hope vs. Reality,"This book really focused on Reality vs. belief. It showed how science has more hard evidence with the eyes. Belief and religion is more with the mind being mentally satifying in a fantasy land of hope to better conditions than what we have here. We all have different hopes and beliefs. But science hits reality and evidence showing that we live and die. Being Zapped into a space that is a figment of imagination called Heaven is a great escape from what we call reality, as well as the science of how we came about in this mysterious surrounding called life. We live in a place and time where survival of the fittest is the key to success (more money more power to survive). This is a great book in that it brings us to reality and gives us the science of what life REALLY is. Hope and escape from this reality is what we call religion. We don't know the meaning to life. Maybe we've had the meaning to life all along. Maybe we just don't have the guts to recognize that this is it."
2,How is it that?,I have sean many similar products and theories like this one and I am always mystified by the hopelessness of all these wonderful ideas. Hydrogen Peroxide sounds like the answer to so many problems it astounds me that it is still a conspiritory unknown. Our nation and many others have bit the dirt because of health and medical costs. The USA is about to transform into a overcrowded hell hole because corporate leaders want a larger consumer market each year. The biggest consumer product and service being sold is medical. If these demagogues of American and world industry can keep such a product secret when so many are suffering then I guess evil wins and we are forever the victims of their evil. How could this secret still be secret? Jim
1,Bummed out sound,"My wife bought this item for my birthday and I loved it for a couple weeks or so. Then, the headphones began to pick up a very loud static ring after 30 minutes or so of use. Gradually it became more frequent until they became unusable. (Yes, I tried new batteries.)Unfortunately, because my wife bought them two months before my birthday they AREN'T COVERED BY THE 90 DAY (who would believe that) WARRANTY!"
2,Convenience but no Quality,"I love/hate this blade along with the Fein sander. The tool and blades like this are so convenient; they get you in tight places, allowing a lot of control, but this blade, along with the e-cut blades are...poor value for the money. They are not bi-metal like good recip blades, or carbide, like good saw blades, they're just plain steel, and they don't last. I have a table saw blade, I paid [$$$] for, but it'll last a lifetime, because it's good quality carbide, and it can be sharpened. As for blades like this one, if you're a contractor like me, you better have a big markup for overhead, because these babies are going to cost you. I actually took my complaint to the company; the rep I emailed said they pleaded with the manufacturers in Germany to make the price more reasonable, but to no avail."
3,Other companies?,I'd like to agree with the other reviews on Fein: great tool funky blades. Can Lenox or Starett make blades for the MultiMaster?
2,Pinochle Player,"This book is pretty worthless. It doesn't give some of the major variation of the game, such as double pack Pinochle where the winner bidders exchange 4 cards and such. Some of the melding scores are incorrect. I would buy a general card rule book, instead of this very outdate and incomplete book."
1,This sucks,"Ugh. I have been using this watch for over a month and have yet to have it work correctly. I have already had to glue the transmitter piece back together. If I do manage to find a connection I had better be careful not to run within 10 miles of the nearest ground projection or the satellite connection will be broken. Any stray wispy cloud or piece of floating cottonwood can cause the satellite connection to be lost. I love how the literature says it is great for hiking. Maybe above the treeline and cloud cover. So, if you are planning a trip to the top of Mount Everest, this may be the watch for you. Otherwise, save your money and your sanity."
5,THE BEST POKEMON GAME IN THE WORLD!!!,"This is the ULTIMATE pokemon game in the universe!!! it has killer graphics, awesome gameplay and so much more!!!Using Shadow Pokemon, an evil organization called the CIPHER has unleashed a sinister plot to take over the world. You start off with your fist pokemon: Eevee, you must fight against terrible foes and race against time to snag and purify shadow pokemon and turn them back to normal before CIPHER takes over the world, but wait, there is one powerful Shadow Pokemon. The one that is almost impossible to purify. Unravel the mystery of Shadow Lugia TODAY!!! Buy this game NOW!!!"
1,Game is not good! after all I hate pokemon.................................,This game is the worst game I have ever seen the graphics are ok but not what I expect. I hate pokemon. Lets say it we hate pokemon!
1,8 episodes for full price??,"I am amazed that the marketing team thinks that this is a fair price for the last 8 episodes of Season 5!! At this rate, will the price for Season 6 be over 150.00?!?!?! Yikes! I will NOT buy at this price, it can sit on the shelf!"
2,Damaged case,I enjoyed the DVD very much. My problem was with the case which holds the DVD's in place. It was broken and I had to return it. The new one they exchanged it for was fine.
4,Inside digital tv antenna,"This was my third try at purchasing an antenna that would work and it is excellent. The two others, one being an RCA flat against the wall and the other I can't remember the brand worked but this one really brought in the signals. It would be nice if the govt. had said we must purchase the ""box"" AND an antenna. I couldn't figure out why the instructions showed an extra wire to ""nowhere"". Then someone told me I had to purchase an antenna also to get my old tv to work. Well, the boxes didn't work on anything so I ended up (thanks to the US govt.) purchasing a small flat screen tv. This antenna was the one that did the best job."
3,Base is to small,"Although this antenna received UHF and VHF stations up to 25 miles away, the small base made it unstable when the rabbit ears were extended. It was annoying to have to re-balance it every time we changed its direction or configuration. Which is why we returned it."
4,Terk amplifited indor antenna.,It works great. We put the antennae upstairs and use the cable outlets to our TVs and get perfect reception. We tried the regular Terk Antenna but only the AMPLIFIED one worked for us.
5,Terk Indoor Antenna,Very easy to install and does not require any instructions. Other than a pedestal/table top surface to place it on there is no problem. I used the top of my stereo case and it works fine. Reception is as good as cable.
4,Excellent Antenna for UHF channels,This is very economical HDTV non-amplified indoor antenna works best with my samsung HDTV. I live within 4 miles radius of the station tower (Sears & John Hancock towers). Its catches UHF signals very well if placed in proper direction but its not good for VHF channels like CBS.
4,Works Pretty Well,"I have no other antennas to compare it to, but sitting atop my Pioneer TV I am able to pull in a few digital channels and an HD Channel about 75% of the time (CBC HD). I'm a good 25-50km away from the broadcast tower, don't really have line of sight. I think the antenna does a fine job, I'm just in a bad location. I live in Cloverdale BC, 3rd floor of a Condo. For the price, it does the job quite well."
1,Fell Over & Broke in Less than 5 Min!,"Poorly designed & top is very Light,bottom Isn't heavy enough nor wide enough and comes -w- aprox 5' cable/short & I had just set it up & my son bumped it & it fell down & both the side antenna's Bent over like Floppy Bunny Ears and I was pretty Up-set esp when I hadn't had chance to see how it worked & I couldn't return it all bent like it was,it works ok but often it needs to be moved & that's a hassle esp being so light & oddly designed it want's to TIP OVER all the time,if U know UR Sweet Spot where U can place it & Not need to move it,it might be ok but I like my indoor/outdoor antenna better & that poor thing has been dropped many times & there's Lil to break on it but this one I'd Not recommend it to anyone...."
3,did not work.,"people if you live in NY queens and in an appartment building, this is not for you.did not pick up no high def nothing. i got very fussy signal.but hey maybe i lived in the wrong spot. and maybe u live in the right one. so you can give it a try.bye."
5,Simple & Effective,"Got this antenna from reading the good reviews it got. What can I say? The antenna works. I had to adjust the positioning of the antenna a bit, but afterwards, I'm able to receive all the channels in my area. On rainy or cloudy days, I might loose reception on some of the farther channels, but it's no biggie. Overall, well worth the money."
4,Works as Advertised,"Had an old pair of rabbit ears which were only able to get one channel. Hooked up this antenna and now I can get all of the local over the air channels, many in HD. Product has worked great for me. Only critique is that when you extend the rabbit ears in back the antenna is not very stable and can easily be tipped over if something brushes up against it. Would suggest that they add a base to the antenna to provide more stability."
4,Best indoor/outdoor antenna,This is so far the best indoor/outdoor antenna we got.Two thumps up for the product & amazon.com
2,HDTVi Indoor Antenna,"I couldn't pickup signal well unless I stand in the middle of the room and holding up halfway to my ceiling. I don't know what's wrong, but I can pick up better signal on my rca rabbit antenna."
3,This is a directional,its an awesome indoor antenna for the price. there is one one problem i can only get 4 out of the 6 hd channels because the other two signals come from a different locations. i need to get a multi directional antenna. great starter antenna though ;)
3,Terk Tech indoor TV antenna.,"Works well but stiff cable connecting to TV, along with a tiny base, make it nearly impossible to keep it in place. They need togo to a higher-quality flexible interconnect, and also, a method of easy disassembly (to allow substituting a better interconnect)."
3,"Not that bad, not that good (in portuguese)","O Tihuana tem tudo para ser uma √≥tima banda. Mas faltam alguns detalhes. Primeiro, e acho que principalmente, as letras. No tem nada a ver. Sem p√© nem cabea. Mas os ritmos e a musicalidade da banda so bem interessantes e criativos. Destaques para ""Pula"", ""Praia Nudista"", ""Que Vez"" (que ali√°s, √© muito mais mel√≥dica que as outras), e ""Tropa de Elite"". MAs eu odeio a m√∫sica ""Eu Vi Gnomos"", que no fao ide√≠a do motivo do sucesso atual. √â uma droga. Entre essas e outras, o CD √© bem legal de conferir. √â um estilo pr√≥prio mas voltado ao punk rock."
2,"Trouble with the top, as designed","I have used this once, and probably for the last time. The lid will not stay attached to the base without extra weight. There is a very weak design to the lid closure that releases as you screw down the top. Basically the lid catches on the two short sides with a small 2 mm lip, one side having a press to push out release and the other acting as a hinge until the top is lifted or it is pressed towards the side engaged. The problem is the the top, when screwing the press down also bows out the lid and releases one or the other of these catches. It was very frustrating to screw the press and have the side release. My wife was thinking that I was too aggressive, so she operated it and the lid popped again for her as well. Finally held it down with a thick cookbook:(Joy of Cooking: 75th Anniversary Edition - 2006). Pickles were successfully produced, but not useful enough to use again. I would recommend a lid that itself screws down, then you can screw the press down."
3,"Decent book, but first paragraph destroys credibility","Perhaps I misinterpreted the first paragraph, but the Angelfish we've had routinely snack on neon tetras. They are not especially good community fish, which is typical of ciclids in my experience. Nice pictures."
2,Angellfish Attack!,"As I read the summary of the book it states that angelfish don't attack gourami's etc. NOT TRUE! I have an orange veiled angelfish for about 5 years now and they get very territorial as adults at around 2 years old. She will beat another fish down just for raising it's head up. My angel and the gourami grew up together. When they both got to be the same size. She beat him with her nose. But to be fair he chased her also. Fish I would put with angels are catfish, clown loaches and red barbs or mollies. These fish don't try to occupy the same tank depth as angels. They congregate on the bottom to mid tank. Angels like mid to top, but you may find them resting on the bottom when they are not feeling well. So, though I was hopeful about the book I did not purchase it."
4,More than adequate for the price,"I've owned this radio for nearly two years. Considering the low price, it performs admirably for my needs. I use for a couple of hours at a time, several times at week while working out and running. It is lightweight (doesn't pull down my running shorts) and the ear phones are comfortable. As for reception, I've been able to receive any local FM station I've tried, even in the basement of my health club. I'm ordering another because the beltclip has broken (because of my own clumsiness).... but for less than [amount], it definitely meets my needs."
5,"Great, but a complete ""A Christmas Carol"" recording is needed!","This CD containing excerpts from three 20th Century English ballets is a real find, making one wish for more. Of special mention is""A Christmas Carol"" ballet, with music by Carl Davis. It is simply a must own highlight, worth the price of the CD by itself. A DVD of this ballet is available. The music, the dancing, the costumes all contribute to 86 minutes of pure joy. I was in tears at the end. I am surprised that this ballet has not been performed more often; it certainly deserves to become part of the standard ballet repertoire, alongside The Nutcracker. I am greatful that this CD with some excerpts exists. My list wish would include a complete recording of it on CD, as well as a Blu-ray version of the ballet. Highly recommended!!!"
3,Overrated Mao Zedong,"I felt this book--more a monograph than a biography--was a bit too cursory to really get at the heart of Mao. The war years are covered in just a few pages, and the period of Mao's reign is covered in much the same fashion. I found myself wanting to know a lot more. Considering the relative importance of Mao's reign compared with his early life, it's a little strange so much time is spent in these early years. After reading the book, I still don't get a clear picture of how Mao was able to parlay himself into the leading figure in communist party and then how he was able to keep so much power to himself later on. In short, it was a fair introduction, but it lacked depth and balance."
2,Diaper Review,"It just didn't work for my particular dog. The sizing was wrong. It fit fairly well everywhere except the important part stuck out the top on my boy dog(if you know what I mean!) A smaller one wouldn't work, nor would a larger one. I was unable to return them."
3,It Works OK,"This diaper works OK for my female dog (when she is in season). I had to go with a size smaller than the sizing chart says, German Shorthair Pointers have very small waists! I would say it is a perfectly acceptable product."
3,Nice Camera,A perfect replacement for any one camera this is not.It is more cumbersome than a point and shoot.Its pictures are far less detailed and sharp than a SLR.White ballence and collor saturation are ho hum.good long Zoom and anti shake features make for nice additions to a just ok camera.I bought mine on a great sale at the end of production.I have enjoyed it but there are others which outshine it in almost every area.(albeit they are 4x the price I paid)
1,Konica Minolta POOR,"Assuming that this camera is the same plastic that my Z1 was made of ....I purchased my DiMage Z1 about 3 years ago. I have meticulously cared for it, since it was so expensive. I had to send it in for repairs before it was a year old. I have since had multiple pieces of the cheap plastic break. The battery compartment is CRAP. It was repaired the first time. Now, two more pieces broke off INSIDE the battery compartment, while it was in the camera case. The ZOOM switch broke, while I was zooming. Now I have to replace my camera, since I am not putting any more money into this one. Needless to say, I will not be buying another Minolta product."
3,Ridiculous price for outdated camera,"I bought this model 3 or 4 years ago for a little over $200. I recently lost it and was going to buy another since it was a great camera for the price then. However, for these times the Z6 technology is dated and you can get a better camera with the same features, plus more, (e.g., the Nikon CoolPix P100, a 10 MP camera with a 26X optical zoom) for at least $100 less than Amazon is asking for this model. Asking $400 for this outdated camera is ridiculous! A reasonable price for this camera would be more in the $100 - $150 range."
1,Dont waste your money,I bought this camera thinking it was going to be amazing considering the price and reviews. It works nice but when you zoom it is blurry 90% of the time. Also this camera does NOT work at night. Even with the flash it doesnt pick up anything. For the price you can get a lot better camera. My sister got a kodak v550 for 30 dollars less and it was 3 times better. Dont waste your money on this product
1,I Would Have Given It ZERO Stars...,"This book is trash... the storyline is horrible, and the writing and the grammar are elementary. This book was a waste of my time and money (luckily it was cheap)!"
4,Love thy sister watch thy back,"Just like the title says, watch thy back! Loved the book, hated the overrall outcome, however its one of the best book I've read."
1,"Please, Please dont waste your money","This book has one too many typos and the storyline is way too farfetched. I too wondered how Ms. Campbell became a publish author, honestly if she can write a book with a list price of $15, I should also be allowed to do so. This book will rot your brain, stay away, and spend your hard earn cash elsewhere."
5,One of the best!!,"Although the editing was horrendous, the story was so excellent and intense that is overshadowed any grammatic problems.The drama in this novel was wild! Ms Campbell laid out a story 3 female friends (or so they thought they were friends) that MAKES a reader glue to the story. It shockingly concentrated with real issues, sadness, feline problems, social issues and just plain life and the cruel hand that some people are dealt."
3,Good if you want more than the Defrag that comes with Windows.,"I've had a good experience with the ""Stealth"" and ""Space"" methods but the more advanced methods have caused crosslinked files. I was able to fix the problems but I'm sticking with Stealth or Space options. I don't want to take a chance of damaging the files beyond recovery."
4,Preity Woman!,"This movie has been compared to, and is roughly analogous to the American film ""Pretty Woman"" in a lot of ways, but it's actually a lot better! If only they had cast someone other than the not-particularly-appealing Salman Khan in the male lead role, I'd have given it five stars. There is a lot more going on here than in the predictable American plot. Rani Mukherjee is fantastic as always, but Preity Zinta really carries the film right over the top. She is an entirely sympathetic character, as is Rani, and that's what gives the film a very interesting complexity. The only real question is, why would either one of them get worked up about Salman Khan?He is by far the weakest character of the three. Now, if it were Shah Rukh Khan in the lead, or Abhishek Bachchan, that would have given us all something to work with. Whatever. Farida Jalal is also excellent, as always, as the mother we all WISH we'd had. I definitely recommend this film very highly. Well, almost."
4,good quality,first try at creatine and this seemed to work. I used this with muscle milk and noticed a difference within 2 weeks. Never had any adverse side affects. I will purchase this product again for my next cycle.
1,very disappointed,"I purchased my Freud FJ85 based on my previous experience with Freud products, the apparent value and the great review in Fine Woodworking magazine. Unfortunatley the saw is a piece of junk. It did not cut properly due to a faulty guide and the blade would consistently fall out. Now the saw will not even start up. When I contacted the service department via email, I received a response insinuating that I may have been lying to them when I told them that I bought it a year ago. I guess I should have gone with my first instinct and gotten the Bosch. I wouldn't recommend this saw to anyone."
4,Great Buy For The Buck,"I recently bought this saw and used it quite a bit. It has great balance and plenty of guts. It cuts thru 3/4 plywood with ease and holds a real straight line. The only small draw back is the shoe does not have very accurate settings.It's not a big deal, for the price savings compared to the other saws it's worth every penny."
4,A good value!!,"I had never purchased a Freud product, so I really didn't know what to expect. This one had the capability I needed and was in my budget range. I have not been disappointed. This saw has all the power I need. Whether its 1/2 "" ply or 3"" solid oak this saw cuts it like butter, is stable, and provides a smooth cut. The quick change chuck it great!!"
1,Not for everyday use,"If you need a jigsaw every once in awhile, this is the saw for you. If you need to use it quite a bit, this is not the saw for you. The fact that there is only 1 speed when you pull the trigger is so incredibly stupid. Yes, you can move the stupid little wheel at the top and it does work, but why not have a variable speed trigger? That way when you need to make sure that your cut is going to be exactly where you want it to be, you can make the initial start slow, then speed up. I bought it because it was a Freud, it now sits idle in my garage while I use the Bosch at work simply because it sucks. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. Ah yes, and I almost forgot, it comes with the dust port with a guard that is supposed to help with the dust. If you need to use it without a vac, say outside, the stupid little thing keeps falling down, holding dust ON your line which is so incredibly moronic."
5,Great Product worth the money,This is a great product and is worth the money. The baskets are very large and hold quite a few items. Great for gift baskets. I plan to order more!!!!
4,Living The Grape Life,"The second book in The Break Through Series, and better than the first, Secrets Of The Vine is a guide for coming closer to God. The whole book is based on the words of Jesus recorded in the first few verses of John 15.Jesus uses a grape vine to teach his apostles the true meaning of abundance and how they might achieve abundance in their own lives. Bruce Wilkinson breaks down each of the lessons so that we may understand it better.He does a good job. Secrets Of The Vine delivers its message clearly in simple, easy to understand terms. More importantly, Bruce Wilkinson demonstrates how we can make use of the grape vine parable in our own lives and, thus, come closer to God."
1,Well intentioned but sells selfish message,"I'm just afraid the author is exploiting readers' desire to be rewarded by faith, when faith is its own reward. A relationship with our God is so precious - even for those of us who (for reasons only he understands) are helpless and hurt. For this to be a bestseller tells me we are hungry for a message of gratification. At bottom we still want our works to be rewarded. If only we had the keys to our own salvation, to bring ourselves reward. Still it is only grace that saves us."
5,Regarding this 2008 special edition import...,"There are several versions of this album on CD--some out of print, some of questionable quality, some just plain expensive. To my ears, this new import is great. It sounds exactly like I remember it sounding on my turntable. And I can't think of a better compliment you can give the remastering of an old favorite......oh, and regarding the cover: it's a cardboard jacket like an LP. The CD is printed to look like vinyl and comes within its own plastic LP insert sleeve. There are two slips of paper in there, too. One side of one sheet has the song listings. The rest is in Japanese."
4,"No, No, only I was there for this recording...","It was Summer in Jersey, when Utopia performed this concert. Todd flew in on a winged Unicorn named Raul, making several passes over the amazed audience. He landed and spent several minutes arguing Quantum Theory with a gnome, a surly wood nymph and an Italian, before bestowing immortality on the crowd...It doesn't make a difference where this was recorded, it is a fine work. Unfortunately, it is the start of the Broadway period for Todd. i never cared for the pop stuff he did so much of (and that I ended up buying, hoping for more of the original Utopia). If I wanted Andrew Lloyd Weber, then I would buy Cats (might as well offend both camps). If that is your cup of tea, then you have several albums to choose from.If you like the space/psych prog from the previous album (like I do) then this is the last of it. So enjoy!"
2,Toddler Favorite Review,This CD skips here and there. Not happy with it. Songs are great but the skipping is annoying. Can I exchange it???
2,"Mommy says, ""Kill me now!""",This CD has several great names on it - but there are little kids in the beginning of each song starting to sing or making comments. Some people might think it is cute - I think it is higly annoying and just awful! I can't listen to it anymore and I've had it a week. The songs in the middle (about 5-6 songs) are just terrible and I had to skip over them. I would not recommend this or buy it again. I purchased this one instead to replace this horrible CD: http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Genius-Favorite-Toddler-Tunes/dp/B00069A78K/ref=sr_1_21?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1278606352&sr=8-21. It is so much better and no children are making noise all throughout the CD.
4,"Liked it at first, but gets old fast","It's a decent CD, especially for the money. I'm just sick of listening to it. My daughter still seems to like it, but she's only 21 months, so it's hard to tell what her true thoughts are. She's really into kitties and puppies, so she enjoys all the meowing and barking on the CD. She also likes to make train whistle noises, so she likes the song with the train in it."
1,Horrible,"Both of my kids (and my wife and I) can't stand this CD. The singing is horrible. The versions of the songs aren't fun at all. We have many children's CDs, and my kids (and my wife and I) love the Little People CDs the best (by far). My kids cry for the Little People CD when we put this one in. It's going in the trash."
4,Has all the good songs,"If you're looking for a best of toddler faves, this is the best I can find. Even though the singing leaves a lot to be desired (sounds like an old granny singing the lyrics, albeit a vibrant one). Most of time, true to the original compositions and some well-known rhymes included. We are pleased."
3,Daughter Loves it; Parents Not So Much,"I bought this CD because the price was good, and I thought it would be a nice CD to start a collection for our toddler. Our daughter just loves the songs on the CD and immediately asks when getting in the car to put her ""car tunes"" on. My husband and I, however, aren't too keen with some of the singers' voices--a bit annoying. But our daughter loves the CD, and bottom line, that's all that matters. We will be adding more toddler CDs to her collection, and we hope to find more we enjoy as well."
2,So-so,"I really wasn't thrilled with this tape. Quality was so-so, not a great buy even for a small price."
4,My Kids Love This Music,"My two kids love this music. They want to sing along to all the songs. We have a long commute and this is one of their favorites to listen while we drive. I recommend this music for car trips, it keeps the kids happy from start to finish."
2,Warning: Contains off-tune singing by actual toddlers. :),"Eek! Be warned that this CD contains lots of songs actually song by toddlers, i.e. you get off-tune versions of ""the wheels on the bus go wound and wound"" etc. Too bad, because the artist has some funny ideas for several songs. In my opinion, the singing toddlers makes this CD almost unlistenable."
2,inexpensive but problematic,"The main problem I found with the router was the poorly fitting 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch collet. Both were too large to fit standard router bits when the compression nut was in place. I had grind the hardened steel collets on a lathe ( to avoid unbalancing the rapidly turning bits) to fit. The second problem I found was that the system that controls the depth of bits is sprung to high. This makes it difficult to extend the bits without using excessive force to compress the springs. The adjustment knob, usefull for fine adjustments, also requires excessive force to turn when the springs are near full compression. Because the knob compresses only one side it will jam pulling the router out of alignment. This makes it difficult to use in a table. The final major complaint is the collet doesnot extend far enough for some short router bits. In summary inexpesive but beware of its limitations."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I put a tongue and groove edge on 1500 linear feet of eastern red cedar to make random width panel boards for my sunroom walls and trim. I purchased the Freud router since I presumed it to be heavy duty. (The work took place over several months time. I rarely ran the router more than a couple of hours a weekend.) The cedar, being very soft, surrendered to the router bits like butter to a hot knife. However, the Freud sputtered and died after about 1100 feet. It would either not hold speed against a load, or not run at all. I finished the job with a $39 ebay chinese import. I originally avoided the cheapie in favor of getting one that I thought would last, and I guess any thing can happen, but at least for me this unit did not make the grade. I like the layout and the controls, and the depth gauge, which is why I gave it a couple of stars. But durable? Nah! I'll go for another brand if I get serious again."
5,The drunk goats,"This is a pretty good rendition of the Gotal from the cantina scene. He's got a surprisingly bright color scheme, but he's otherwise pretty one ugly goat. Since there were multiple Gotals in the movie, this guy is a must-have. I absolutely love how he holds his glass of red ""juice"" so well - he looks like a classic bar patron. My only criticism is the blaster - it's very rubbery and looks a bit bent. But, then again, the character in the movie didn't even have a blaster, so it doesn't really bother me.Unfortunately, he seems pretty expensive - I found mine for double the store price, and the prices listed here are even higher! Hopefully, you can find a few cheap ones and have a few milling around the bar."
3,Freud 6 inch Dado,"The blade itself is good but it comes with no markings whatsoever, no or limited directions and it is nearly impossible to get off and on your saw spindle. I believe it actually scored the threads on my spindle because now it's hard to get the nut on for thinner blades. For almost $90 I'd expect the blades and chippers to be marked.Once you do get it set it cut decent but I'd go with another brand if I had to do it over."
4,Great Game for Early gamers!!,"I-Ninja is one of those games like Banjo Kazooie and Crash Bandicoot that could be a verry good mascot for the X-Box system due to its very rich enviroments and easy game play, it is also a great game for thos little kiddies that ya dont really want to play Resident Evil. The game is captivating in that the game play changes through out, from driving a mamoth robot to shooting turrets and the ability to upgrade your belt and swords make the game much more entertaining to see how fast you can get to be the best! I very much enjoyed this game but wouldnt play it much as it should be played by those in the age range of 5-12 years old. I hope to see a sequil in the future."
3,"I-Ninja is a lot of fun, but gets tired soon.","Fun platformer with good action and a decent amount of humor thrown in. Animation is pretty good too. (The way his mouth goes into a scream when chopping up baddies is great.) The problem comes in when you can't advance in missions without a high belt color, and you are forced to replay maps over and over to get the belts."
2,Too Big!,"I should have looked at the measurements before I bought mine. I never imagined they would be so big. I was going to return them but the shipping cost to return the package was about 80% of the item price, so I guess I'll just give them to GoodWill or something. I can't use them, they are too big and ugly."
5,Spreaders are Great,"We had a spreader like this for years and used it almost daily. When the handle broke, we looked everywhere locally without any luck not thinking of Amazon. These are the exact replica and we love them. Did not need 4 but what the heck. The price is right. They have the serrated edge so you can spread and then cut! Perfect!"
1,These are absolute garbage. Absolutely no finish on the wooden handles. They look like crap from day one.,"These came with labels stuck onto each and every wooden handle (yeah, who knows why). No way to get them off except to soak them off. When the labels came off, so did all the finish - the water actually turned red and the handles looked like I had owned the things for a hundred years. OUCH! Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,Kinda boring,"Call me immature or whatever but I prefer my Trail of Dead loud and dangerous. This is my least favorite of their albums. The songs Stand in Silence, Wasted State of Mind and So Divided are good, but still didnt rock me like their older songs: Another morning stoner, caterwaul, relative ways and a ton of others did. Maybe it'll grow on me the way Pretty Girls Make Graves latest Elan Vital did...But their tour with The Blood Brothers should rock me. Both those bands kill it live."
2,sub-par effort,"I've been a huge fan of the trail of dead since their beginnings, and yes, i really enjoyed Worlds Apart, which was original and managed to inventively depart from their signature sound while remaining a real musical achievement. Guess i started thinking that they wouldn't ever deceive me ... but this album is a real let-down -- feels almost like a sell-out ... I mean what's with the Oasis impression? Overall this album features feeble lyrics, uninspiring music and awful production, as exemplified by comparing the official version of Witches to the original version provided as a ""bonus"" track."
2,Not Synchronicity,"I heard this entire album in a record store while waiting for the band to show up for an in-store appearance. It took a handful of songs for me to realize it was in fact Trail of Dead. Ask yourself why the band only played one song from this album live (Detroit show anyway). One song? Everything else was old stuff. Literally. It's the So Divided tour isn't it? Makes you wonder. Love the 1st album, love Madonna, love Source Tags, Love Elana's Tomb, liked World's Apart. Hated this. See Conrad's Pitchfork interview where he talks of becoming a graphic designer because he knows his band is doomed."
3,"Skip the brush setup, just get the spray.","Im not sure how clean people expect their chains to get, but I expected a whole lot better than what this brush contraption did. Honestly after trying it a few times I gave up using the brush bit and just used the spray. The cleaner itself was very good, the brush bit was useless. Spray + Old Tooth Brush + Rag = Much cleaner chain & gears."
1,I can't believe this clown is still writing books,"How do Michaelson's books keep getting 5 stars? Does he get all of his friends to rate his lame books as soon as he publishes them? This book was great the first time I read it -- when it was called ""Sun Tzu for Business.""Please stop buying his books, so he'll go away.Thanks."
2,doesn't last,"We have had the DVD player for less than a year and it is already broken. The problem is the plug outlet. At first you can wiggle it and the DVD will play, but the problem eventually worsens. Don't buy it, but if you do GET THE WARRANTY."
2,One-touch redial feature doesn't work; phone volume low.,"the one-touch redial feature advertised for this phone doesn't work. if there is a busy signal, you would have to get dial tone by pressing FLASH button, and then press REDIAL button. the product specification claims that pressing just the REDIAL button works when there is a busy signal. also, the volume of hearing in the phone is lower compared to other phones like panasonic and uniden."
4,dolls,"ive always loved horror movies and i remember watching this years ago, a really good movie so far fetched but if you dont like dolls look out,your next! a really clever movie with the killer dolls and all, just dont let little kids watch it!"
1,Terrible acting,"This film should've been a tales from the crypt episode, As a full length film it fails. The acting is horrible, there is no nudity or gore and the dolls themselves are un-interesting and un-scary.If you must see this film, Do yourself a favour and rent it like i did."
5,Freud SD208 8-Inch Professional Dado,I have been using this set for furniture making. The bottom cut is even and the cuts are clean with no tearout. This is an excellent dado set. What more can you ask of the blades?
5,Awesome,I have used this blade several times. It has always preformed flawless. The cuts are precise and clean.The guide that is included is very clean on what parts to use to get to the proper width.My only issue with is the markings on the thinner spacers. The guide has the measurements in Imperial but the spacers are stamped with metric. I just wrote on them with a Sharpie so the two matched up.The blade is very sharp so you have to be care taking it on and off the saw arbor.Great blade!
3,One chipper was not shipped with the item.,The 1/16 chipper was not shipped with this dado set. The Instructions show that to cut a 5/16 dado groove you should use two 1/8 chippers and one 1/16 chipper. i can not cut grooves in 1/16 increments. For most of my requirements this dado set is no good. Very displeased with this dado set. I would be very pleased if the dealer would ship me the missing 1/16 inch chipper. Amazon Verified Purchase
3,Dado blade not satisfactory,The Freud Dado Blade was too difficult to install with the metal shims. They kept getting caught in the treads of the arbor. I even damaged the arbor on my saw because when I tried to tighen the blade one of the thin shims had slipped into the threads of the arbor. The blades were also difficult to remove becaue of these shims. Bought another brand with cardboard shims and they seem to work. Initially I liked the principal of the Freud Saw but I couldn't get it to work properly.
4,4 out of 5 ain't bad,"I would have rated this 5 stars if no shims were required for a 3/4"" dado (as advertised). But it does cut very smooth and square on my under-powered table saw."
1,terrible dado set,"I have owned this dado set for 8 or 9 years. It has never cut very well, leaving rough bottoms with a lot of chip out. It got to the point that I used my router or router table for most dado operations, avoiding the Freud dado set altogether. I have owned other Freud blades for my table, miter, and skil saw. These blades have done a good job at a reasonable price, but this dado set has been very disappointing. I would not buy recommend it."
4,Tremendous Resource,"Treasury of David is a wonderful resource if you are planning on doing any preaching from the Psalms. The genius of this work is not only Spurgeon's commentary on the Psalms, which in itself is excellent, but for each Psalm Spurgeon has included a wealth of quotations from other authors which he studied in putting the commentary together, including Martin Luther, Calvin, Augustine, Baxter... and countless others.The reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is that there are some publishing issues with it. For instance in the middle of the 51st Psalm there is a page that should be in the 25th Psalm commentary. This proved to be an annoyance, because the page that was supposed to be there was missing altogether. This is the only instance I have come across, but it is hard to believe there are not more.All in all, I recommend this book highly, and do not think any buyer would be disappointed the purchase."
2,false or confusing advertising,"This product was clearly advertised as a 3 volume set. However, I only received on volume! When I contacted the seller via e-mail, they responded with a very nasty e-mail saying I didn't need to be so rude (which I wasn't! I just told them it was advertised as 3 volume set and I was upset to only receive one volume). False or confusing advertisement on top of terrible customer service!"
3,Bar is Bitter,When I bought this product I was looking for variety since I had just purchased a box of the lemon bars. These bars were ok but left a bitter aftertaste. I think I will stick to the lemon.
4,Definitely reminiscent.,"This CD's really kewl, it makes me remember those days sitting at home with my friends listening to the radio and daydreaming of marrying all those famous *hearthrobs* hehehe..."
2,Damaged Merchandise,I was disappointed to find that the dvd was damaged. Only some of the shows can be viewed.
2,Disappointed,Disappointing...I was looking forward to giving my Maltese a good trim but these clippers did not do the job very well. The hair constantly got jammed up in the blades so I resorted to using scissors. I consider this a waste of money.
5,Easy to use,"This is a five star product which is great for a one-star-just-learning groomer. I have a standard poodle, and decided it was time for me to learn to groom her myself when her haircuts cost me twice what I'd pay for my own! It doesn't stay cool for as long as I'd hoped, but long enough for me to get a lot done. This product has made a daunting task much less so, it's quiet so my dog stays relatively calm and she actually looks okay. A few more times, and I may go pro! Very satisfied."
2,Sound is not that great,"Not happy with sound quality. The speakers are bigger than expected and don't come with mounting bracket/arms. The speakers have metal clip on the back where you can put them flat on the wall with a nail or a screw. So this means you can't control the angle at which they point. Even if you buy separate mounting brackets, you will not be able to mout these speakers becuase there are no universal mounting holes."
3,Decent...,"Product showed up quickly, but after an hour of use, it ceased to respond. Looked up store's site to see about replacing it, and they wanted me to pay return shipping( 100 dollars and hours of repacking) Looked up Onkyo's site for warranty info, same deal. Had to take it to a repair shop and paid 70 bucks for ""loose connections""...Not a fun experience. Works fine now, and the store may be a victim of circumstance, but I definitely won't shop at this store's site again."
4,"Loved it, with a few exceptions",Amazon service is supurb. Arrived ahead of time and in perfect condition. The Onkyo theater is an excellent choice for a first time home theater buyer. Easy to set up-don't pay those crazy installation costs-mine was up and running in about 30 minutes. Go thru the instructions and it's simple. The only drawbacks for me were mounting the speakers and connecting the speaker wires. I purchased speaker mounts (Also from Amazon--Premier Mounts PSPK-2W) that could not hold the weight of the front speakers. Also had to drill into speker to use them. The rear of the Onkyo tuner is very well labeled. But the wire connectors for the speakers was cumbersome for no good reason. I would recommend buying speaker wire (at least 14 guage).Loved everything else about this system. The microphone is great for setting the speakers. The sound is fabulous.
4,Make sure you realize what you are getting,"This is a great book if you are ONLY looking for the melody, or lyrics, or chords. I came across this book thinking, great, so many songs. I was disapointed when I realized what it was. I can't complain. The price is right."
4,hmmm... what can I say,"just give this guy a break. even though there's some great songs on this album, it's certainly not the best album he ever released... but with more than 25 prince albums out there, which one is his best album? no way to tell... which one is his worst? no way to tell... the guy is just a genious... or at least that's the way I see it. not to mention his live stuff... ""wow"" is all I can say about that..."
3,RAVE IN2 The Joy Fantastic is Worth Searching For,"What are you doing to your fans, Prince? You released ""Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic"" when you should have released ""Rave IN2 the Joy Fantastic"" the remix CD on your website. The title song is the funk your fans expect and the rest of the remixes shine brighter also. Please come home Prince. Please let your fans know you are still there for us. To the buyer - try and track down a copy of Rave IN2 the Joy Fantastic. It's much more funkier."
4,GOOD COME BACK,"I REALLY ENJOY THIS CD. THE ARTIST PUT HIS ELBOW IN THIS ONE. I REALLY ENJOY MOST OF THE TRACKS AND I CAN RELATE TO WHAT HE IS SAYING. THERE ARE A FEW TRACKS THAT ARE A LITTLE OUT OF MY LEAGUE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART I REALLY ENJOY LISTENING TO IT. I LISTEN TO IT ABOUT THREE TIMES A DAY.."
5,Another Job Well Done By Prince,"Prince is never to be underestimated. His talent is raw and in a group by itself. His voice is beautiful and flawless. Rave un2 the Joy Fantastic starts the CD off and is one of my long list of favorites. Man O War, tangerine, the Greatest romance ever sold, the sun, the moon and Stars, i love you but i don't trust u anymore, AND the REST of the CD are classic as well. Prince is a fantastic producer, songwriter, composer, whatever. He is a genius. If you do not have it, invest in it. It is oh so worth it!"
2,The final blowup of a once promising career,"This is another in a long line of below average to average releases from Prince. Prince (as he once again wants to be know as) no longer makes great albums. Unfortunately, he has also lost the ability to write good singles too. His remaining talent is that he is incredible live. Save your money for his next concert.At 43, Prince would seem to be running out of chances to pull out of the death-spiral his career is in. Efforts like ""Rave"" are not helpful. Even the presence of popular artists like Sheryl Crow weren't enough to keep this uninspired mess on the charts. If he is not careful, he might be remembered for the past ten or so forgettable releases rather than the brilliant first ten."
4,"THANK YOU,GOD!","We held our breath and....now we can exhale. Prince has produced the artist's best album in eons. For once, even the hip-hop elements work. And his version of ""Everyday is a Winding Road"" cooks. the ballads are nice and the hidden track""prettyman"" is the best funk to come from the man in God knows how long. A no-risk disc."
5,"The prison atmosphere made me paranoid, so I went and punched some dude.","Then we started fighting, and Cash started singing about stomping in his old dog's head, and all of a sudden I was on top of this guy, punching him in the face, like full on bum fight style. Then I ran across the street and kicked a kid off his bike. Hee-yah! I tied my stereo to the bike, cranked it to ten, and rode off, flipping off several old people as I rode by them. The chick old person was peeved, but the old man gave me a thumbs up. Johnny Cash fan, I thought, and peddled away."
4,Lots of Fun,"It is ironic that even though this concert was given at a prison and most of the songs are about being destitute, this recording is fun to listen to. It really helps to have seen the movie, ""Walk the Line."" When you listen to the CD in the context of Cash's life and the reason he played at Folsom, this CD takes on a whole new dimension. I am not usually a fan of Country music, though I have been striving to care less about style and more about content, but this music has a lot of heart. It is not intricate, nor is it ingenious in its conception, but the passion is there. The only annoying thing is that if you are not careful, these songs get stuck in your head, especially ""Folsom Prison Blues."""
4,The Man In Black As He Was Meant To Be Heard,"The 5.1 SACD version, I was not that impressed with. However, the stereo version sounds great. DSD was designed to archive old analog tapes and that's again what Columbia (now owned by Sony/Philips who pioneered the technology) did with this project. If you're a Johnny fan, buy it and hear what the album was meant to sound like originally without sample rate/quantization conversions."
2,Wrong one,It was supposed to be 7A....and the package and receipt says that...but 5A was delivered. Now they are just going to be used as practice sticks.
3,Beer belly,The shirt fits fine at the shoulders and arms. The shirt is sturdy and the buttons are solid. It's the excess of cloth that just hangs from the stomach section. It's a bit hard to explain it's loose from the stomach section it's perfect if you have a beer belly you'll be able to tuck it in but if you're a slim Medium like me it just looks silly.
5,!!!,emblazon with rank and insignia and you've got a quick and easy uniform for your very own fascist youth party.
4,Colour isn't as pictured!,"I bought this shirt for my boyfriend's halloween costume (and because it is durable and useful in the long run). I was expecting a light khaki tan colour-- which is the colour in the picture-- however it is a darker khaki that we really can't use! While it is a great workshirt and fits well, we still have to find another shirt because this one is too dark."
2,order a size smaller than normal,"The sizing was wrong. Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big, and once you try it on you can't return it. stiff and uncomfortable material."
1,Broken Connectors,This HDMI cable worked perfectly untill the equipment was turned before unplugging the HDMI cable. I broke the first cable by turning the cable box 90 degrees. I broke a second by swiveling the TV on its mount. The connectors pull right out of the cable and i can't put them back on. Great cable but very stiff. They have weak HDMI end connectors. Do not put any stress on the HDMI connectors. Go straight in and out. No twisting or side to side movement. Only 1 of 3 i bought is still surviving.
2,Fein blades,I never would have purchased a Fein tool had I any idea about the blade pricing. I am a general contractor and window installer and cannot afford to use two $60.00 blades per job. The blades are not durable and will be destroyed when used on fiberglass. The tool is left useless in my garrage due to the blade pricing. I think making replacement blades for the Fein at half the price may be a better business venture.
5,"Thought provoking and profound, a book to be read slowly.","This is a tremendous book. While the author writes in an academic style, there is a warmth and questioning tone that makes the method engaging. Perhaps the important thing is that I learned from this book and it is making a difference in my life. The concepts of looking at others in an attitude of embrace and of love being a necessary precursor to justice are antithetical to my societal training. I was also struck by the section comparing the concepts of covenant and contract. Permanence in relationship, what a novel concept. Volf's book is an honest attempt by a scholar to look at the complexities of relatedness and identity. An attempt to summarize his thoughts in 1000 words is bound to fail - read the book."
4,Sony MP3,"The unit is fine, except that it has the old charging cord with a large jack on the end, unlike the same model that I lost and replaced it with."
4,Just right,"I like simplicity of this album, as well as the option of placing photos either vertically or horizontally. You can also add descriptions if you want to. I've made albums for four of my grandchildren so far, and am now working on the two youngest. I put a loving note to each of them in the very first pocket so that they will always have a reminder of how much their grandma loves them. I've also tucked in a couple of programs I've saved from school events they've been in.I'd give this album five stars if it still had the binding that was all in one piece, which I think was more attractive than the current style, which has the front and back covers separate pieces from the spine."
4,nice photo album,"This photo album is almost as good as the other pioneer leather albums I have which are a little more substantial. I own many of these size pioneer albums in varying model #'s and every now and then, I get one that the clear film doesn't adhere to its glue and the pictures come loose. I still buy more because they are a good price and a great way to organize my photos. Adorama's shipping was super fast."
5,A light-hearted treat for the holiday season...or anytime!,"What a delightful story! The plot has been described beautifully already by Amazon and fellow reviewers, so I won't take the time mention characters or events. What I will say is that this story is full of reunited high school sweethearts, feuding mothers, fun family members, neighbors and, eventually, forgiveness, romance and a happy ending - Would you expect anything else from a Christmas story?!?I highly recommend this book. This was my first experience with a Debbie Macomber book and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing style and the fact that she set the book in Oregon, my home state. It's a beautiful tale that you can read quickly and is guaranteed to leave you with a smile. :)"
1,MAKE IT STOP!! PLEEEASE MAKE IT STOP!!,"Oh my god!! These songs are SO annoying that it would be the worst form of torture in the world to have to listen to them all! The original artists should just sue them or not give them premission to sing there songs because they are THAT bad.Take Jessey Mccartney for example...I hated him and his songs to begin with but to hear these childrens ugly little voices screaming the lyrics make me hate it even more (if thats possible), and then they do the WORST thing possible...they sing Alicia Keys, HOW CAN THEY DO THAT!!The original artists aren't even on this CD (as if they'd disgrace themselves by doing so). These kids cant sing, the orginal artists aren't even on here, they change the words to make it ""better"" (dosent work) and they absolutly RUIN the songs we know and love.If you want to keep your hearing....DO NOT and I mean do NOT buy this CD..EVER!!"
1,Garbage of the lowest order!,"The Kidz Bop series continues to represent the lowest common denominator in music today. I would never let my kid listen to these junky versions of (mostly) disposable pop music. If you want to listen to this stuff, what's wrong with just going out and buying the original version(s) of the tunes covered here?I guess this would have appeal for some, mainly soccer moms."
2,Looks good but slippery sole,"I've had many pairs of Sperry Top-Siders over the years and have found them great.This pair however looks good but has some kind of a yellowish coating on the sole that makes them slippery on dry floor; so haven't tried a wet surface. I had such a hard time finding boat shoes in black in my size that I'm keeping them and just using sandpaper to try and get the coating off, but I won't be ordering from here again."
1,The bottom of shoe is rock hard.,"I love the color of the shoe, but when I took these shoes out of the box, the bottom of these shoes were ROCK HARD. The rubber is supposed to be white, but these were yellow. It seems like these shoes have been sitting in a warehouse for ages. I wore these Sperrys out for the first time and I fell. They were so slippery and stiff. Pieces of the rubber chipped off when I wore them. The bottom of the shoes were so hard to the point that when I walked they made a LOUD noise. I can't even bend my feet when wearing these. Now, after wearing them once for 2 hours, there are cracks ALL OVER the bottom of the rubber. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
5,Great Seller,Airportsale RulesShipped super fast and the item is perfect.I would happily buy from Airportsale again.
5,I'm a pre-k dance teacher and never get tired of this cd!!!!,"I have listened to it over and over and the kids never get tired of it!!""Three little fishes' gets them swimmin around the room!'The chewing gum song""gets you up and moving and adults don't tire hearing the songs over and over.I reccomend this cd highly!"
4,Great,"This book came in one time, and in great condition. The price was extremely fair and I definitely got my money's worth. Overall, great transaction and I am very satisfied with what I received."
5,~*~AWESOME~*~,I love my zone pilates! It's sooo easy and only takes a few minutes a day.. which is great being a new mom I have very little time to myself. For the people who complain that it hurts.. it's probably because your legs are out of shape and too big for the ring.. use the extension (sorry not trying to be offensive). I like that it only takes a few minutes a day. If you think it's not working it's probably because your rushing through the moves. Go slow like the instructor says. You will feel the burn trust me... I am sooo sore! But I feel better already and I've only used it for a week.
1,This product was a joke,"I purchased this from the TV AD, When I got it I was very excited, put the DVD in right away and was totally disappointed. Not only did the lady on the DVD have a frumpy body but the exercises where a joke. I thought ""no big deal, not to surprised as it was cheep"" that was until my credit card kept getting billed for some subscription that I never signed up for. I know what your thinking ""read the fine print"" only problem is there is no fine print. No where do they tell you that you will be paying enormous shipping and handling charge along with a $29.00 per month subscription. I would not recommend this to someone I hated, let alone someone I liked."
1,Not very good,"Product doesn't work as claimed. Need to put it under very hot water to get the color started and even then, color doesn't transfer to hair, just leaves a waxy buildup on the hair. I would not purchase again."
3,just ok,"This is the first time I've used a wand to color my hair. I wish the manufacturer would put an expiration date on it. It was quite thick, tacky like and made me wonder how long it had been in the tube. I worked the wand in the tube, like you would with mascara, but it didn't seem to help. For me, it was more trouble and messy than doing a root touch up with permanent hair color. I love the shade and tried to find it in a permanent color and couldn't (:"
3,Corel Paint Shop Pro X Revealed,This is a great book for anyone who is new to Paint Shop Pro X. She did not wased our money by having color pictures to explain what to do. They are not needed. It is to the point and very helpful. I would recomend this book to anyone who is starting out in computer dark room. I love it and will look for other books by Sonja. A+++++++++++++++++
3,"Great at 300DPI or less, Above problems with Black","I'll probably end up taking this scanner back and trying to find another one to replace it with. Whenever I scan pictures that have a high black or dark content at anything above 300DPI, it scans two pairs of vertical stripes that are about two shades lighter than they should be. The stripes are about an inch apart from each other and about 4 inches from the edge.I talked to HP support, which was great, but they had no solutions for me. I exchanged the scanner and the replacement had the same problem. Of course I tried all the basic things from HP, but to no availe. They are sending me an XP driver CD(since I upgraded during the time I was having the problems), to reinstall, but I don't think that will help at all and I will end up looking for another product.I was very pleased witht he software and tech support though, too bad the hardware isn't living up to my expectations."
5,Intergalactically Superior Super Cool Sander,"Oh my, what a piece of equipment. Opening the box was just like Christmas! High quality components, hefty feel ( but not too heavy ) ultra long power cord, . . . and then I turned it on. WOW, does this do a great job. super smooth sanding with ZERO dust (I also purchased the FEIN Turbo III vacuum / dustless system) the sand paper does NOT clog, ZERO airborne particles, and no residue on my safety glasses! (highly recommend it with a FEIN vacuum with AUTO start, when you turn on the sander, the vacuum also automatically starts! This unit is spendy, but WELL worth it!!!"
1,Genesis,I bought this commentary to use as an aid in my Bible study group. I find it hard to read. The format is very confusing. It was not a good purchase.
2,another oldie,i agree...as a writer i so appreciate delinsky's recent work... this one is frustrating to even get thru!
5,very good,"I bought this cd the other day, and it has some really catchy and meaningful songs...and yes they're not quite so ska anymore, but bands often change generas, so you've just gotta deal with that...it shouldn't lower the value of this album. I really respect this band given the fact that they write their own songs and lyrics, and how they present their songs is up to them and you either like how they do it or you dont...so listen to the samples and if you like what you hear...then buy the CD, its very good."
3,"If Pop is your thing, buy it!","But if you're looking for Ska then don't. If you want Save Ferris, the Ska band, buy either of their two earlier albums: their major label debut, ""It Means Everything"" or ""Introducing Save Ferris,"" which the band members produced themselves. I've been a fan of these guys for years now, Save Ferris was a great ska band because it was so well integrated. Mashburn is a great guitarist and he got to showcase his stuff more on the first two albums. Zamora, Castellanos, and T Bone Willy, arguably, the best brass and sax players in OC Ska today, really jammed in both of the earlier albums. Now they provide more along the lines of background music. Powell is a great vocalist, and this fact is apparent in any of their three CDs. I'm not a fan of pop music, so this album doesn't do that much for me, but if you like pop, well, at least this is really high quality pop produced by talented musicians."
4,"different, but still unmistakeably save ferris","Takes a little while to get used to (a poppier sound and a lot less ska, though it's definitely still there), but thoroughly enjoyable once you do. I like 'it means everything' a little bit better, but the new album has its good points and the songs are growing on me more and more. Recommended tracks: 2. The Only Way To Be, 4. Your Friend, 7. What You See Is What You Get, 11. Let Me In, and of course 9. Mistaken."
2,"Quoted from Song #2, ""It's All about the Money...""","Yes yes yes... ""it's all about the money"" definitely can describe this album as a whole. Save Ferris has definitely sold out in this album... the songs aren't fun anymore and sound so commercialized just BEGGING to be loved by the majority and be played in the radio constantly... so YES, it's ""all about the money"" for Save Ferris, a once-unique band... Yes, it is quite a shame.If you want to hear some real music by some wonderful Female Vocalists... the Dance Hall Crashers know how to get ya groovin'!"
2,Ska is no more.,"Save Ferris second cd, Modified was doomed to fail. Ska music faded into oblivion by 2000 and this talented band never had a chance to shine. I like some of the tracks but I don't LOVE them to pieces. Mistaken and Let Me In are excellent break-up songs but their sound is limited. Save Ferris showed a lot of promise with their debut, It Means Everything but some things can't last. I am sorry to say this album was not golden."
3,Coming From A Devoted Fan,"I've been a follower and fan of Save Ferris for years now, and as much as I love this album, it doesn't do the band justice. They're depriving their awesome brass section of time in the limelight and in some songs, abandoning their ska roots. If you want something like ""It Means Everything"", ""Modified"" isn't for you.On the flipside it's still a good album. Very upbeat and poppy. I can honestly say I enjoy every song on this album (except for ""No Love""-I tend to skip over this). Monique is once again proving herself to be the GODDESS she is, although definately mellowing it down. She doesn't belt out quite as much as IME, which came as a dissapointment to me.So, overall, good album. But if you're just getting started in the skankin' world of SF, get It Means Everthing instead. Or better yet, see them live. NOTHING CAN MODIFY THEIR LIVE SHOW! :)))"
3,"Not a ska album,but pretty decent pop","If you liked their last cd you might want to listen to this one before actually buying it. Most of this cd is a collection pop/rock songs, all w/high energy,but w/out the srangeness and fun of itmeanseverything. Track 5 sounds like a watered down version of ""lies"" This does have some good parts to it. Track 6 has an awesome sound. But the best song is ""let me in"". Bottom Line: Good if you liked IME, Even better if you've only herd ""mistaken"""
3,New Album Not As Impressive As First,"With the new CD it seems Save Ferris totally abandoned the light-heartedness of ""It Means Everything."" I think the band will gain new fans from the album, but may lose old fans with their new sound. Definatly not as fun as ""It Means Eveything,"" but still decent."
2,"Bad, bad, bad","This sequel to Joe Dante's imaginitive and off the wall Howling is one of those cheesy 80's horror movies that are spoofed today, which can be seen the minute this schlock-fest starts. Christopher Lee graces the film as a werewolf hunter on the trail of a wolf clan, and other than that there isn't much else to the story; just cheesy gore, werewolf sex, and Sybil Danning's large endowments. Just as the next Howling sequels would be (believe it or not they get progressively worse as they go on), it's all downhill from here, and if you've seen the original Howling and have never seen any of the sequels, don't expect anything good at all from this cheese fest directed by Philippe Mora. The only good points that make Howling 2 worth watching for horror fans is Lee's great performance, and the surprisingly hot Sybil Danning. Other than that, this is better left on the shelf."
3,"So Bad, It's Gold","Reasons to watch it:1) Christopher Lee in new wave wraparound sunglasses. I even use it as my live journal avatar. He looks cool as hell. LOL.2) Sybill Danning ripping her shirt off. In case you miss it, they play the same clip about 1000 times repeatedly at the end. Hilarious!3) Christopher Lee has the magical ability to make any bad movie watchable.4) A grotesquely amusing hirstute orgy. Seeing is believing.5) Sybill Danning's bizarre costumes. Think Pointer Sisters meets Conan.Since I have been unable to resist this film anytime it airs since the first time I ever watched it in the 80s (I write this as I watch it on cable on Xmas Eve), I am going to break down and add it to my collection. You should too."
1,"THIS MOVIE MIGHT RATE 1 STAR, SYBIL DANNING RATES 5 STARS","This movie is a badly made sequel to the original with horrible special effects, hard to see print quality, and boring story. It starts with Reb Brown teaming up with Christopher Lee who is a werewolf killer. In this movie it takes titanium stakes or bullets to kill one. SYBIL DANNING plays Stirba, Queen of the Werewolves. Her rip away bra scene is shown over and over again at the end of the movie. The reason for this is because it is the only special effect worth watching. Sybil is one Amazing Beautiful Woman! Anyhow Reb and Christopher go to Transylvania and try to stop Sybil from having her werewolf clan take over the world. One note of minor interest is that Sybil is suppose to be the first blond werewolf in film history. I don't know about that, but she is certainly the most attractive."
3,Another Point of View,"Although the Howling 2 did not appear to be as a the first one I found that there were good points to this film. I thought it was interesting that people traveled to""transylvania"" (of all places) to pursue werewolves. The scenes that took place in the village were well done and they did a good job of making it appear that they were in another dark country. The castle of werewolves was also a good touch. When people think of ""transyvania"" in pictures they think of vampires. I think werewolves added a genuine approach. Also, Sybil Danning has excellent breasts. Perfect for viewing. I think its a good flic because its interesting and at the same time you can laugh at it."
5,Great for energy!,I started taking Brewer's Yeast when I was in perimenopause 10 years ago to help with my fatigue and minor depression. It really worked for me. After taking this I had lots of energy and my minor depression went away. I also give it to my doggies. It really makes their coats soft and shiny. I love this stuff and will never go without.
4,Great potential,One of the joys of a Heyer novel is the incredible detail she gives to the secondary characters. The world of the hero and heroine is fully realized because of this. But in Lady of Quality we spend too much time with the secondary characters. I like Annis Wychwood. I would have liked more time with her and Oliver Carleton. They are an interesting pair with great potential. I love the way they make each other laugh. But their love affair constantly takes second place to the background noise. They don't even get the final scene. That honor is reserved for Annis' brother and his wife.
3,Too slangy,"Heyer must have dug up every slang word and phrase of 1818, then put three or four on every page of this book, checking them off her list as she found places to use them. There are so many colloquialisms being thrown around that it becomes an irritating distraction. That, coupled with the lack of plot, underdeveloped characters, over-abrupt ending, and the abominable way the heroine treats her cousin, makes this book less than satisfying. Heyer is no Austen."
5,true to period as always,"'A Reader' (1) wishes Oliver Carleton would have affairs with women of his own class (2) is unhappy he 'keeps' women of a lower class (3) is unhappy that this situation recurs so often in Heyer's Regency novels & that her heroines accept it.Well -- either Georgette Heyer is writing about the Regency period _or_ she is writing about the mid-20th century. You can't mix the two. Heyer's novels are perfect 'period pieces' -- no one else has captured the particular social milieu she writes about, as well as she has. There are plenty of novels set in the mid- to late 20th century that of course project the practices & attitudes of _that_ period. Why take these novels & then simply dress everyone in Regency costume? What's the point?"
5,Identifiable ingredients!,"When we adopted two small shih-tzu puppies, we went to our local pet store and sampled a variety of puppy and adult canned foods. The biggest difference in puppy diets is that they are higher in fats and calories for high-energy fast growing puppies. Our puppies are not picky at all, so it wasn't like there was one they hated, but what we liked about this food was that had identifiable food chunks in it - duck, carrots, peas, etc, it wasn't too smelly, they have good solid poops with it, and they are growing quickly / happily on it! They've been eating it for three months now with no major issues, so it is our go-to food until they hit 1. We like it so much that I bought some of the adult food for our senior dog, and he is doing great on it - he has sensitive stomach issues, so not all canned or dried food digests well for him, but we've had no issues with this brand for him (Senior Plate, Turduckhen, Thanksgiving plate, etc)."
2,Ingredients gReat! But taste and smell terrible.,"I have a 6 month old maltese and he has gotten tired of eating his dry food so I have been searching for other foods to give him some variety. When I opened this can up, the first thing i noticed was the terrible smell. When I layed it out in his platter, it smelled like a combination of dog poop and cat food. I nearly barfed. When I heated it up a bit, it smelled like medicine. Needless to say, after a few bites the puppy lost appetite.He will only eat it when I mix it with Cesar Dog Food (any type really). Its such a shame that such ingredients were put together in such a messy manner. There are also quite a few big chunks in there so it doesn't seem like the makers really put much thought into this."
5,My large puppy loved it,I adopted an older standard poodle puppy that we couldn't get to eat anything. Tried this and he hasn't stopped loving all Merrick foods. No digestive upset at all for him.
5,I've read about everything Hillerman has written.,"I've read about everything Hillerman has written, and listened to most of his recorded Books on Tape. I'm an ex-Peace Corps Volunteer and appreciate his fascination and his realistic approach to this original American culture."
3,TALES OF MISS BEATRIX,"There's enough plotting in this book to fill three books and that is its ultimate weakness. It's a long, sometimes tedious, read but one has to give author Goddard a silver star for being able to weave all the myriad of plotting into a cohesive resolution. The plot is way too labyrinthine to go into detail here, but suffice to say it involves the murder of an elderly spinster, a dead heroic poet, a young niece trying to find out who killed her aunt; a somewhat sleazy antiques dealer and the brother accused of the murder; the young girl's brother and his promiscuous wife; an American cad; and the Spanish Civil War.There's lots of twists and turns, and although I didn't find it one of my favorite reads, it's a well developed if somewhat lengthy read."
4,Dnelius,"I purchased the Fein saw about a year ago. I have found that the tool is very useful in everyday home remodeling. Although as mentioned in alot of other reviews, the Fein blades are very expensive for the amount of use you get out of them. I recently discovered that Sears makes a simular tool and Sears blade will work on my Fein tool at half the price of Feins asking price. I have used the sears blade and they last about as long as the Fein blade. I know where I buy my blades from! Maybe Fein will get the message and become more competive in their prices/"
4,Does the job.,It's always best to use the mfr's bit with their product. Thats the design and it allows the best use of the tool. I'm happy.
3,Missing major songs,"After The Knack released ""Get the"", they instantly became my favorite band. I still to this day enjoy listening to the entire album. Although I lost interest after thier 2nd album (mainly because of the introduction Harder/Glam Rock like Van Halen, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, etc) they still should have been supported better than they were. The reason I'm only giving ""Best of"" 3/5 stars is the lack of other songs off of ""Get the"" such as my favorite ""She's so (Selfish)"", ""The Monkey and me"", ""Frustrated"" and ""Maybe Tonight"". If you don't own any Knack, your better off buying ""Get the"" instead of ""Best of"". Don't agree? Read the other reviews."
2,Disappointed,"This is definetly a step back for Sierra. This game seemed to have all the annoying parts of half-life plus a few of it's own. Half Life is a great game, but it's engine does have some problems. This game seemed to be incomplete or like corners were cut to get it out for Christmas.I finished this game in less than a week and I didn't really spend that much time on it."
4,Could be sold a little cheaper.,"I purchased this product to do some lap swimming at my wellness center and have the ability to listen to some music while doing so. The device is easy enough to load your mp3's onto with the included software. The sound quality is mediocre at best which is the fault of the poor quality of the ear buds. The ear buds are often difficult to keep in your ears at all times as they tend to slide out of your ear during quick underwater movement. I have a slight problem with the price of this device considering its small size and the fact that it is basically a USB flash drive inside of a water tight container.Final Word:This waterproof mp3 player is probably a better bet in its price range than other models from other companies, so if you don't need perfect quality sound then this is the player for you!"
5,Beautiful painting,"This album is a musical treasure--hauntingly, almost indescribably beautiful. Lyrically, The Painter expresses what it means not only to be Christian, but to be the Church--the community of the redeemed. Both the musical and lyrical richness is expressed especially well in ""Behold Now the Kingdom,"" a song with the potential not only delight, but to transform."
5,Beautiful,"Bought this for my dad. He used to have this album on vinyl. He said he really wished he could have it again so I came to Amazon, found it and bought. He thoroughly enjoys this album."
2,PSh.,"This is a good cd. If you like talentless songs, horrible live performances and hearing Shane Told go wayyyy off key. The old songs quality is so poor you can't even enjoy the music (Though I think if it was good quality it would STILL be hard to enjoy). The acoustic songs are alright. No different than the normal songs. Bringing no originality to this cd, with the exception of the Smile in your Sleep remix. Which is actually pretty cool. But the rest of the cd is embarrasing for the band. I have no idea why they would release this. All in all I'd give this cd a big NO! It got a 2 because Of the remix. If they had a 1.2 I would have given it that, but it dosen't. So 2 it is."
2,no redeeming qualities,"This is NOT ""non-stop, edge of your seat adventure."" The story is pedestrian: the beached ship has all the supplies they need. Plus the island unaccountably has sheep, goats, even a dog. The boys don't do much of anything except climb rocks and recite dumb lines. It is not credible that Jules Verne could have written anything this bad. Even the bad-guy bit at the end only lasts ten minutes and is a fizzle.The acting is of the quality of a junior high school play rehearsal--an early rehearsal. The technical quality is a cut above a home movie, but not by much. The sound is atrocious. The movie is 66 minutes long.I can't imagine anyone who would enjoy this movie, not even young children."
5,Great stuff,Have used it for years on cars & boats & it outlasts anything I've ever used by far. Can get away with one application per year & it's easy to apply & remove after drying
5,Best that I have found,"I have been using this product for over 2 years now on 2 cars, It glides right on with an orbital buffer, (Recommended application) and leaves a better than show room shine, I even had a body shop owner ask me how I keep my 1999 nissan altima with 128,000 miles on it looking like new, I apply it at least 4 times a year here in the Phoenix, Az region, 2006 rav 4 sleeps in the sun every day and also looks as good as NEW, simply the best paint protectant that I have ever used. (10 years detailing experience)"
5,"Liquid Glass, the wax to beat!","After a lot of Internet research, I bought a can of Liquid Glass Pre-cleaner and Liquid Glass Polish to finish my 1983 Datsun 280ZX a few years back. Since the finish had been largely ignored, I first started with a Meguiar's Direct Smooth Surface Clay Kit and brought the finish back to very smooth to the touch. I next used the Liquid Glass Pre-cleaner to remove oxidized paint. I finished with the Liquid Glass Auto Polish and had a very smooth, deep shine that lasted far longer than conventional wax. It applies easily and comes off just as well.I still have the Datsun and it still looks great. I recently bought an Infiniti G35 and Liquid Glass is once again my finish of choice. Great stuff!"
3,Missing power cord and CD!,"I just received the printer, but I can't use it because it is missing power cord and CD! I have always had very good experience buying computer stuff on Amazon so this is very surprising! So I called customer service at Lexmark and they said they will ship those out to me. Hopefully I will get them in four or five business days.And yes, you do have to buy your own USB cable and ink."
5,Mark O'Connor--the new Aaron Copland,"Mark O'Connor will become known as the Aaron Copland of his time. What a wonderful group of pieces. Also impressive is ""The American Seasons"" by O'Connor."
2,Play R3K,"If you wish to play a historical simulation based on the Three Kingdoms Period get Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Its the original and still the best. Fate of the Dragon plays like Age of Empires with a more in depth Chinese campaign. All around an ok RTS, but not innovative and certainly not as in depth as R3K."
5,This book will make you a professional with Illustrator,"Sharon Steuer has gathered an incredible array of artists and painstakingly dissected their work. Even if you only learn one or two techniques from this book, you can turn yourself into a professional artist making big $$$."
5,This book rocked!!,I really enjoyed reading this book alot!!! I stayed up until 4 am reading it. i really could not wait 2 get 2 the end of the book. although it was a little strange anyone who like romance novels will truly love this book!!
4,anchovy paste,"really liked this, also freezes well if your like me and buy a whole case of it. adds really good flavor and has a good taste if you like anchovy."
5,My dog loves this food,"This is my dog's favorite wet food. She is a 60 pound black mouth cur, and she gets so excited for this can. I love how there are big chunks of chicken inside the can, and the gravy is great when I put it over wet food for her. She really enjoys this food or so it seems. I was a little skeptical when I found a bone in the food, but right on the can sure enough it says there may be bones. I took one of the bones and looked at it and it disintegrated so it won't be a choking hazard. Merrick wouldn't put it in the food if it was a chocking hazard they pride themselves too much. I have called them before on something and they made right immediately and apologized a hundred times. They are a great company in my opinion."
2,Too much gravy and don't like the bones.,"I did not realize that this actually had the bones in it. Not something that I would give to any dog let alone a Yorkie and a Poodle. The bones take up a lot of room in the can. The rest of the can contains little cubes of meat, a few vegetables and lots and lots of gravy. I usually split half a can between the two dogs. The only way I am able to get another meal out of the can is to add more cooked vegetables. The dogs really like it but I will not buy this flavor again. You are getting less for your money since it contains bones and so much gravy. I would recommend the Turducken. They absolutely love that one."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,This was the worst ordering mistake ever. This was just old interviews that were so far out there that these people are clearly mentally ill. Save your money because this is the worst rental ever.
1,Too costly... does not last more than one tile..,"Just two things you need to know about this blade:1. Does an incredible job removing grout. Can't get better than this.2. Blade only lasts for one 1' x 1' tile!!! So if you're thinking about redoing a bathroom or something, forget it, it's way too expensive.To me it defeats the purpose of having such an amazing tool if it's not cost effective and practical to use it.Can't help but feel disappointed. They just want you to blow money on this stuff."
1,Carbide Grout remover,"Blade never finished removing grout from the first tile. The blade was useless. The original blade that came with my kit worked 100% better, and it was almost completely worn off. I agree with most reviewers the cost of the blades are to high, I check e bay daily for deals and buy when available. Othrerwise the Fein Multimaster is a great tool for the home handyman"
2,Not Reliable,"Just picked up this little beauty and couldn't wait to start filling it up. Unfortunatly when I plugged it into my Windows XP machine it asked for drivers! No software came with this, it claims that you don't need any drivers for XP. The website doesn't even have drivers for XP! How can I install something that doesn't exist? I could have just gotten a bad drive, but I'm not going to risk it with my data. Needless to say I'm returning this little beauty tomorrow. I need a product that does what it says it can do. And I will think twice before I consider buying from sandisk again."
2,Could not get it to work with usb 2.0,"My computer has usb 1 and 2. It would not work with the usb 2.0. I only got a nasty yellow exclamation point on the screen. I restarted the computer with the device plugged in the usb 2.0 port, and got only a black screen -- computer would not even start. It seemed to work fine in the usb 1.0 port. Frankly I would have been happy with that, but since it is advertised as usb 2.0 compliant -- then it should be so. I took it back."
3,My thoughts on the SanDisk 512MB flash drive.,"Well, I was a little disapointed with the SanDisk because it did not fit as much as I was hoping and it would not put some of the data on it that I wanted. The reason I bought the SanDisk was to transfer some music from one computer to another. I have downloaded all of my CD's onto my computer at work and I wanted to download them to my laptop as well. I didn't want to have to download each individual CD again; it takes too long. I chould have burnt the music onto a CD but I didn't want to waste that many CD's just to transfer my music. So I bought this Sandisk. When I downloaded the MP3 music files it only stored the songs. All of the song and album information was left as unknown. So I had about 130 songs with no titles. Maybe it was because the SanDisk was full with songs so it didn't have room to store the song titles and album information. I don't know."
4,so far so good,"i didn't use this rigourously, but it works fine with all my computers. Good product."
3,Nice basic all format player,"GOOD: Solid buttons, bottom mounted battery, a/v out AND in, plays DIVX or XVID formats (one main reason I chose it).BAD: does not play DVD+R (just a reminder - description lists the ""minus"" format)A problem cropped up after about 8 trips/6 months (adult use-very low stress). Disk spin up was always noisy, with frequent grinding noises. Lately it takes many open/close trials to get it to start to spin a disk when inserted and even freezes during playback on new DVDs.Judging from other reviews on the web, I seem to be an isolated case."
4,portrait in death review,"I have found all of the books in JDRobb's ""in death"" series to be worth reading. They are suspenseful with lots of twists and turns and give you what you want if you like mysteries. My only complaint about her is that she gets a bit too graphic with her sexual encounters. I can do without that so I skip over it. The length of these books is fine--not too long and not too short. She's very descriptive of her characters; you really get to know them and picture them. All in all, I like her books."
1,Terrible--Who Wrote This?,"Nora Roberts (as J.D. Robb and otherwise) is typically a good writer with an excellent rhythm and a distinctive writing style. I've read a lot of her work and can't believe she wrote this book. The language is bland, the descriptions off, the characters constantly described rather than shown. Everything falls flat. I couldn't get past the first few lines and am extremely annoyed at having wasted my money on this terrible piece of work. If you've read any of her other ""In Death"" books, you won't be able to believe this was written by the same author. I can't, and won't be buying any more books with Roberts' name on them. I like to know that the book I'm reading is actually written by the person whose name is on the cover."
4,good at first,"Commandos 2: Men of Courage is a really fun and challenging game. I emphasize the word challenging. By the third level, I was spending hours trying to figure out how to beat it. I finally had to result to a guide to show me how to beat the level. Once I did, the next was even more hard. I gave it a try, but decided it was too hard. If you like really challenging games, and are willing to sit for hours to beat one level, then this game's for you."
3,"Great graphics, terrible game play","Yes, the graphics and the music are great, but what about the game play? Aside from the fact that the controls are not easy to learn, this game features an absolutely ridiculous line of site and AI. Even the graphics do not satisfy when you consider that only 4 camera angles and only 1 camera height is available. This game is a waste of time. If you want to see great visual effects, go to the movies or buy the new Medal Of Honor. If you want a real strategy game with amazing realism and inexhaustibly fun game play, get Combat Mission."
4,Commandos: A MUST!,"I love this game! First I tried Commandos 1 and good hooked up! It's not just a boring ego shooter... THINK, be fast and watch. GREAT! Be different characters end enjoy different skills!"
4,"Tete ""who"" ???","Tete Montoli is a type of musician that makes an enthusiast of Jazz wonder why he is so little known.He is an amazing two handed player who sits with Tatum and Peterson in ability and improvisation added to which he has been blind since birth.If he had been born in America i am sure his talents would have been recognised and lauded like so many American pianists are .The CD in question shows his talents but there are better recordings of his playing,namely""Music for Perla"" which is a must buy for any Jazz collecter.He has played with Dexter Gorden,Don Byas(who lived in the Montoli home while in Barcellona)and with Lionel Hampton in 1956 which was his recording debut.Other recordings followed with Roland Kirk,Shepp,Don Cherryalso Anthony Braxton with extensive travelling around Europs and the USA.If you do not know of Vincent ""Tete"" Montoli i would suggest you treat yourself,you will not be disappointed."
1,"Promise, but fell very short.","The story had alot of promise, but it just dragged. The characters were uninteresting, seemed very flat, and had little chemistry. The dialogue felt very forced. It's been a while since I have read this book, but at one point, I glanced at the page number, which was near 200, and thought to myself, ""Wow, nothing interesting has happened."" I'm sure he had good ideas/plans for this, but it was executed poorly, which may be harsh, but it didn't work for me. I did read his collection Emporium, which I would recommend over this book."
4,Very funny look at the end of the world,"Great characters and dead-on satire that had me laughing out loud page after page. My only gripe is with the marketing rather than the book itself; though pitched as an end of the world story, most of the book takes place pre-apocalypse, which occasionally led me to be impatient for the Big Event. The apocalypse is no disappointment when it does come, but the real appeal here is the surprising and hilarious antics of the broad and appealing cast."
4,ELMO!!!!,"This toy is fun to drive the different Elmo cars up, down, and around. The only problem with it is the detachable ramp. It doesn't stay on and is very small. I had to have my husband glue it on, so it wouldn't come off again. It could be a choking hazard. You can leave the ramp off or glue it permentaly."
3,Small book with lovely designs,I love William Morris designs so this book is wonderful for me. The book is small and the designs are the typical William Morris fare - no surprises.
5,"""If you love Enya, you'll also love her sister.......""","Maire Brennan ( pronounced Moya ) is a fabulous celtic singer. Her voice seems to float over her words. My favorite is ""Where I Stand"", it is one of those songs you can just close your eyes to and soak it in. I also love ""Bhi Thusa Mo Shuil"" ( that's gaelic for ""Thou Be My Vision"") a lovely classic hymn. Maire was the lead singer and originator of the group Clannad. Enya is her younger sister who was a member also. Enya left the group back in the eighties to pursue her solo carrier. She did ok, didn't she? I absolutely adore Enya's music. Where Enya is a little more new age, her sister Maire is more classic celtish. Their voices are extremely similar, so this one I think is definately worth it."
3,Lost On The Moors ~ Contemporary Isn't Necessarily Better,"I hate to say it but Maire Brennan's 'Whisper to the Wild Water' is the least favorite CD to be found amongst my Clannad, Enya, Maire collection. Yes her voice is beautiful as always but it seems somewhat lost and out of place in the techno-pop music that dominates this -13 track- CD. Those tracks that do manage to stay away from the contemporary beat fair a little better but still not up to past performances and material.If you want just one or maybe two Maire CD's in your collection this is not the one to get."
5,Be prepaired to be a Super SEX GOD,"Was feeling down and needed something to pick up my confidence. Dont have ed but some times you just need a pick me up. let me say, worked amazing. Absolutely 10x better than I thought it ever would. I was able to perform 4 times in one day with in a 8 hour period which is unheard of for me. And you are harder and longer than normal. Also notice more sensation. I highly recommend.Age: 27Shape: Fit/AthleticSex: M"
4,Capone on your computer,This game is easily described....The Sims meet the Sopranos.....I really enjoy this game your goals are simple..become the top dog in the mafia business or die trying the graphics are nothing special and the controls are unfortunatly frustrating sometimes whoever the game is still a great buy.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!,(Let me first say this disc should not even get a one star.) I was very excited to see finally a live disc but was very upset how misleading the cover of the disc was. To anyone out there who may want to buy this disc DONT!!!!!!!!! I think Kool & The Gang should give all us fans a apology for this disc.
1,"This rip-off should be titled ""MISLED""","JT Taylor's voice made The Gang cool, and without him singing vocals, you are wasting your hard earned cash. The CD cover pictures Taylor leading the band in concert, but to my dismay some second rate voice covers the hits (we are purposely misled and should receive an apology from Kool & the lame-duck gang). With JT now back in the band, why release a live CD without him as the main ingredient??? I have lost all respect for Kool. Good night."
3,interesting setup,"I liked how you could see at a 270 degree view with the clock. That way, it would never get ""turned around"" in the middle of the night. The numbers of the time could be a little larger, and the sound quality a little better, but it is great being able to wake up to my choice of CD, radio, or buzzer. To sum it all up, don't be fooled by the fact that the 270 degree viewing makes it different from all other CD clocks, it's actually really not. A decent buy for your money."
4,Classic For Sure,"This album is a straight classic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of a couple songs that are faster and harder, I just think they are better off doin straight slow jams. Anyway, definitely a go hard. Bought it in 8th grade, I'm 22 now and throw it in the deck still"
5,"What You Tryin' To Do For It, You Go Boyz!","This album is a must buy! I loved the whole CD. But I have my favorites, ""What you tryin' to do,"" ""He can't love you,"" ""Let's get married,"" ""Promise,"" ""Keys to the range,"" and ""True Man."" If you have not gone out to get this CD, please do. Much Love to JE!"
4,"New Stars, Jagged Edge","I think that Jagged Edge is a very vivatious sounding group. I love the lead singers voice he has a sound that any song he sang you would know it was him and I like that. They aren't much to look at, but I love there sound and thats what counts. I liked there other album even though alot of people think that this is there first. I think that they should stick to slow love songs cause their voices are to beautiful to waste on hard loud beats where you can't appreciate their voices. They could take the place of Dru Hill now that Siscos doing his own thing. I really would encourage people to listen to this group and buy there old C.D. as well as this one! Jagged Edge Fan, Marrie"
5,R&B - J.E.,"J.E's second release under the wings on producer Jermaine Dupri, puts the quartet in a league with the best male, r&b groups of today. With a more rugged style even the ballads will become a classic for this group. ""Heartbreak"", the intro, short, simple, sweet and flaunts the talent and work put into J.E. Heartbreak. Quickly taking a more upbeat tempo to set you for the love songs, the first song ""Did She Say"" sampled The Beatnuts' ""Off The Books"". By track four the speed decreases. ""What You Tryin' To Do"" where the lead vocals are more of a twisted, fast almost sounding like rapping flow harmony over a mid-tempo production. By the airplay of ""Let's Get Married"" and ""Promise"" I don't need to dissect those two. You could say it is like this. This could have every song as a single with its strong production and appeal with ""Healing"" and ""True Man"". ""Lace You"" was a great way to pick back up your spirits with an uptempo song. All 12 of the titles of the tracks says it all about this release."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! LOCK CHANGES COMBOS!!!,"I am a college student and recently bought this lock for computer security. My sister, who is also in college, bought one as well. Both of us have now had to saw this lock off our computers because it has suddenly changed the combination and became locked on my computer, keeping me from taking it anywhere. The only solution Targus gives is to ""try every possible combination."" There are 10,000 possible combos. This is an extremely terrible product, do not buy it."
2,"Unfortunately, all these bad reviews are true...","I had the same problem - lock ""magically"" reset itself and the combination I had been using for 1 year no longer worked. Fortunately, I was able to cut it off in 3 minutes with a hacksaw. Unfortunately, I am out $10 for the hacksaw and $30 for the lock. Here are the instructions for cutting the lock off that Targus doesn't post on the website, but will email to you:Obtain a hacksaw from a hardware store or similar location. Make sure that it has a high-speed metal cutting blade. After stabilizing the tail of the DEFCON CL in a vise, saw through the head. Do not try to saw the teeth of the DEFCON CL, it is much easier to begin sawing at the gap next to the cable attachment ring. After sawing all the way through, you will be able to take apart DEFCON CL and remove it from the notebook. This should take an average of 10 minutes."
1,Defcon CL reset itself!,"Like most other reviewers here, my Defcon CL reset itself. I have been using it for 3 years and today I entered my combination and found that it would not unlock. Luckily, the internet revealed many reviews that confirmed that I wasn't crazy, the lock actually resets itself!I discovered the new random combination using a slice of an aluminum can (search google). Then it finally unlocked and I will never buy another Targus product again!!"
2,Missing Features that are present in cheaper locks,"I'm using the cable for about a month now and haven't encountered (yet?) the dreaded ""sudden change of lock combination"" so many people here encountered. Yet, I am missing a feature that I had in a cheap clone lock looking almost similar to the Targus Defcon CL. See the black bulk that closes the cable loop ? On the clone it was actually a metalic disk with a hole (similar to the one you find in the laptop). This allows you to lock the cable to itself when going away with the laptop. You might think noone would steal a lock cable because they don't know the combination and would be useless, but it happens (especially because they get a better chance to steal your laptop later on). This forces you every time you need to walk away with your own laptop to have to carry the cable lock with you."
1,Combination mysteriously changed,"I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble. All of a sudden, today, as I went to pick up the lock, which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it, it decided to change combinations by itself. So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I can't rely on!"
1,"Don't Buy ""d","on Jan.6,2008 I bought my son a ""Defcon CL"" combo cable lock. I brought it home ,picked a combination and tried it 3 times and it worked all 3 times!! I then went and put it on my son's computer and guess what? I can't get it off. I guess it changed the combination on it's own. WONDERFUL!!!!I then read all the wonderful reviews about this lock. I hope there are people who will read this before they buy."
4,Good Brand,"I got one of these before and they are really good. I was going to get one at Staples but it was $32. I paid $10 less for the same product, that is a good deal to me."
1,horrible! got stuck with correct combo,"Do not get this, it got stuck in my new macbook pro...and the combination was correct! Would not come out. Look elsewear."
2,"Very average, but there are better choices","Series relies too much on computer animated recreations and talking heads. Not quite boring, but there are better choices like the new History Channel series, Mankind--The Story of Us. Where this fails to captivate the average viewer (for me that's a group of 15 year olds--I teach world history), MANKIND grabs them by the throat and holds their little attention spans hostage for the duration of the program. Might be more of interest to an architect class than a history class. Good info, but weak delivery."
4,Good with caveats.,"I just got this pair, and at first I was angry at the headphones. I couldn't believe how horrible they were.I've finally found the secret to them, though. You have to have the volume on the source turned up all the way for the maximum SNR (signal to noise ratio). If the volume on the source is up all the way, these are pretty good headphones. There are still some goofy issues with them, but I think they'll do just fine.Sound is good, they're comfortable if you have the band at at the proper tightness, and the range is adequate (no 150 feet, though)."
3,Wagner-2900,Like the other HVLP only inportant is the gun.Turbyne on all of them is a reverse vaqume no new technology .Technology like this exsist in Europe from 1976 wen the regular vaqume usto come with one gun similar like this.Sory but everiting her come olmost with 10years after
2,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the poorest books on topology have have ever had the misfortune to purchase. There are several problems with it.1. The typesetting is horrible 2. The notation is poor 3. The choice of material is very questionable (a good portion of the material has nothing whatsoever to do with topology, but rather with set theory and analysis). It goes without saying that there is very little focus on algebraic topology. 4. The ""problems"" mainly consist of ""Prove this.."", where ""this turns out to be a standard theorem proved in most any text or ""Describe that.."", where ""that"" turns out to be a standard definition defined in most any text.A ""real"" topology problem solver would include solutions to the types of problems found in Munkres/Lee/Massey."
1,"Don't bother, the sound quality is terrible.","I bought this CD for the song ""I'm doing fine now "", I went to play it, it has very poor sound quality, no bass, or treble. Sounded like it was recorded right off a vinl album in somebody's garage. I looked at a review afterwared, it pretty much said the same thing. If you do like this group New York City, do yourself a favor, the other CD that's available, "":The best of New York City is MUCH better sound quality. Ten times better."
4,9 sons,".the movie was good ,except that the audio could have been better for 9 songs.the picture quality was good.theplot was easy to follow."
4,i got a secret for you,"Woodstock is a pretty much big festival and it was obvious that Megadeth made it big with its ""a secret place"" song...Megadeth rules the world..."
3,"Woodstock '94 & '99. Peace, Love, Happiness??? OK.","Now, music wise they had good groups but it doesn't deserve to be called Woodstock. It should be called Sellout cause that's just what it's done. Is there going to be a ""Woodstock"" every 5 years now, or how about every year? The CD is good, if you don't mind contributing to a bunch of money hungry people who are using the name ""Woodstock"" to get rich(er). Good CD, Bad Backround."
2,Could Be A LOT Better,"The way this album should've been released was like the original Woodstock album, in a 4 CD box set with at least three songs from every band and in the order that they played too just to make the album seem more complete. I borrowed this album from a friend and I'm glad I didn't buy it. I won't be buying the video either since it's thesame type of thing. The 8 hour Woodstock special that I taped off MuchMusic here in Canada was much more enjoyable."
2,The live Pay-Per-View and Radio Broadcasts were better,"I preferred the experience of the live radio broadcast. Part of this is inevitable: Anything is more exciting when it's happening in-the-moment. The other part is due to the poor CD planning. I agree with everybody else on this page that complained about the CD's ""roster"". Either present the whole thing or the high-lights--not just random selections. My other gripe is that the sound quality sounds little better than an off-the-sound-board tape. Anyone playing in a band knows the clogged, bass-heavy sound I mean. The live radio broadcast sounded much better in that it included ambience. I suspect they tweaked some vocal performances (on the CD) and had to mix out the ambient mics so that we wouldn't hear the sour notes in the distant echo. I don't know for sure, though"
2,Video quality substandard,This performance of the 9th symphony by von Karajan is certainly not his best (I refer to the 1963 recording). But more disturbing is the low picture quality and the highly sterile and colorless images of the concert. The absence of an audience is well noted. In general there is a lack of good classical music dvd.
4,"Works, but poor design","Like the 4"" model (Gator Clamps 404-05 4-Inch Micro Bar-Man Clamps (Pair)), this clamp suffers from two poor design choices:- hard rubber on the pads cause them to constantly slide/fall off- release button on the back of the handle makes it difficult to press it without also pressing the main level which causes it to bind and not releaseThe release button is not a big problem when the clamp is clamped down, but activating it one-handed (which is the point of bar clamps) while unattached is very difficult as you have to hold the whole clamp with just your thumb and index finger."
2,Very hard game,"Pong has good graphics for a computer game, and is non-violent, but I almost screamed the first time I played it. It has dozens of games with random play where the odds are strongly against you. This game probably isn't good for kids."
4,"Champions, Cheaters, and Childhood Dreams: Memories of the A",Just curious...I wrote a review a week ago and it has yet to appear....?
2,"One more ""one night stand""","I love Beverly Barton, but this is just one of the same old things. One man, one woman, one night = one baby. Of course the baby is kidnapped and then the father is the only one who can help find her, or him in this case.I will say it is nice to hear a man admit that it wasn't all her fault. He can accept that he is equally at fault for the pregnancy. However, He can't be a loving husband and father because of a bad experience with his first wife.The Protectors is a good series. But this plot has been done to death, and even Beverly barton can't save it.I wonder if it is a set-up for her next book. Maybe about Kate or Dante.A very so-so read."
5,Great for travel,"Traveling in South America we found toilet paper to be at a premium, and thus the Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes Travel Pack is always in my purse---and came in handy in so many places, including Machu Picchu. The pack is nice and thin so it doesn't take up much room in a purse or pocket."
1,A real disappointment compared to Sheepfarmer's Daughter,"I was badly disappointed with this sequel. It had some promise, but the boring parts were drawn out and the few bright spots were fleeting, and generally destroyed by stupid sub-plots. I really hope that the third book is better than this."
2,The Under-rated Super Producer,"If you discovered Tim Miner on later projects like I did, you might be disappointed with this project. But not for this suggested price.I discovered Tim from listening to rapper, D-Boy Rodriguez. Tim was his producer on the former Frontline Records music label. And because i loved the music and his silky soul vocals, I looked for his name and bought just about every project that he had a producer's credit on -- Margaret Bell, Al Green's ""Love Is Reality"", Vickie Winans' ""The Lady"" and on and on.On this project, buy it for two powerful ballads, ""Cover Me"" and ""Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep"" featuring bgvs by The Winans.TruSoulDJ"
4,Nice roomy pool,"Bought this several years ago and dumped a dirty water out couple days later and never filled it again. It takes a lot of water and since there is no filtering system, you have to empty and refill quite a lot. I put it in a garage, even bumped into it with my car couple times, then finally put it away deflated. Finally got it out again for my now two year old and the pool is still fine, it withstood all the abuse. If you don't mind emptying and refilling frequently even with a little bit of bleach, this pool will serve you well. To empty is a pain though as the plug is on the bottom and if you don't lift it up somehow, the water just sits there. Inflating it takes a while with a camping pump, can't do this by mouth."
2,More Obtuse than the Average TA Book,"Perhaps with time Ehlers writing improved but I found most of this book to be unclear - except the parts at the end about how to use the MESA cycles for trading. He has one idea, a ELI (Ehlers Leading Indicator), that sounds intriguing but darned if I can figure out how to calculate it based on his passing description of it. When he tries to explain phasors by ""think of an engine"" example, he only made me more confused. I really want to understand the mathematical ideas presented herein so I'll keep at it but I'm hoping I'll find a cycle writer with a style I can decipher better. Haven't read his later stuff yet though. Maybe he got alot more clear."
2,Just buy Cybernetic Analysis,"From a historical perspective, this is an important Ehlers book; from a practical perspective it's terrible. I've read all of Ehlers books and this is the worst; it's also the oldest.Just buy Ehlers' Cybernetic Analysis for Stocks and Futures; it is by far the best technical analysis book I've ever read !!!"
3,Good album.,"I bought this album and the more sad hits together. I really liked both albums, but I found this one less accesible. More sad hits is close to Galaxie 500, thats why I liked it so much. This one is really calm, so it got me some time to enjoy the songs. It lacks the melodies you can find in More sad hits or in Galaxie 500's albums, but it has its beauty. I also think the album gets better in the last songs. I see this album as a stairway. The first song is not so good and then it keeps growing and getting better with every next song. If you don't own any Damon and Naomi album, you should go for More sad hits first."
2,Nostalgia was not enough for me!,"Any child or adult that for matter that has been raised on Pixar & Dreamworks will find this poorly directed & coarsely edited film utterly BORING. The only ray of sunshine in is Harry Morgan, however the rest cast including Tim Conway is completely wasted."
4,very good,plays good on machine and is funny enough to make you laugh a lot has a lot of different ways the problem can be solved with you seeing humor
5,Classic family movie - Apple Dumpling Gang,This is a classic movie with great comedy provided by Don Knotts and Tim Conway. Family friendly in every way.
5,Good stuff,"My lips tend to crack in the corners because of spicy foods, lipsticks, and other reasons I haven't figured out yet. Taking L-Lysine has lessened the problem."
3,WEEEELLLLLLLL....,WELLLL. okay. this game is very good exept for a few things.1. you have to beat the game like 4 times to unlock everything2. its really fun the first time you play it.3. if you really want to play the funnest game of all time buy Megaman battle newtork 3: white version.
2,Not for XBOX 360 yet it pairs with your PC the same way,"I bought this for my XBOX 360 since I was doing a search for xbox 360 headsets and this came up and the details lead you to think its for that system + the PC but instead its only PC. It comes with a dock that allows you to pair all your 360 stuff with your PC but for some odd reason you cannot pair it with your 360. I will keep it for my wireless PC calls since it was cheap, but now I need another one... lame."
1,Not Compatible.......,"To whom this may concern, this headset is listed under XBOX 360 wireless headset. So when it came to my home at such a low price, I was of coarse elated to see it show up a week and half later. But when I opened the box the headset was wrapped in regular scotch tape and the headset does not even link with the XBOX! So I'm stuck with this wirless headset that my 3yr. old plays drive thru with. Well I guess it's good for something.......I have made many purchases on Amazon over the years and this has been the absolute worst! Congrats on being the 1st!**Since I have submitted my review they have changed the discription of the headset to(for personal computers)..... stop listing it under XBOX 360 HEADSETS!!!"
3,tough to setup and disconnects easily,This was tough to get to work the first time. There are no instructions and it disconnects frequently. This was frustrating.Still not sure what all the little lights are. They say it is for battery life and signal strength but I am not sure which is which and how I am supposed to see it when it is pressed against my cheek.THis is a great product idea but not ready for regular use. I would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Don't Be Fooled,Where to start i purchased this product thinking it would work with my Xbox 360 and it dose not but on the adapter it actually says Xbox 360. So I tried to return it but to no avail the company said it clearly stated it wasn't meant to be used for the Xbox if I had been smart I would have taken the time to read the reviews because someone else had the same problem. Ok so I was like so its not a total lose I will try it on my computer but it dose not work on my windows system so needless to say I have no use for it I don't feel like looking for all the updates or whatever to get it to run
3,CHEAP BUT WORTH IT...,I use this head set at work so i don't distrube my cube mates. The range is somewhat short but thats to be expected working around many other such devices.
1,Very disappointed,"After reading many reviews for this camera and exploring the many other cameras out there, I finally decided on the Minolta A200. While the camera is really outstanding in normal situations, the auto focus is absolutely useless in low light. Moreover, the camera vibrated roughly when it was trying to focus. Pictures taken in AF mode in low light were very out of focus. I assumed the camera was defective and returned it to Minolta. But when I received it back from them (after 3 weeks), it still had the same problem. The camera is completely unacceptable, if you're ever planning to take a pictures indoors in moderate to low light. I really can't understand anyone giving it a positive review."
3,Poor auto focus and EVF,"The quality of the this camera and lens is good but the auto focus operation is quite poor. Low light auto focus is next to impossible and even in good light the auto focus performance is quite slow. The EVF performance in low light is not very good. I was hoping this camera would be my answer to an ""almost SLR"" but it underperformed. Picture quality was good and flash performance was quite good as well."
1,Not as solid as one would have hoped,"On my workbench the straight rails that form the frame for this kit have warped over the past two years, twisting about 10-15 degrees so that the sliding doors are no longer held in place. Also the drawers and sliding doors are rather flimsy."
5,Above and Beyond,"... not only was i once again quite pleased with the numerous & varied books Amazon can provide, i was also surprised with the speed & accuracy of obtaining my order with above & beyond the expected delivery time & quality of the book which i received ... thanks again Amazon & providers who value books & care about those of us who read them ... geri goldsberry, orofino, idaho"
1,What a mistake,"I've had this printer for 2 years. I don't do a lot of printing - just 2-3 pages per month - but it's been a constant battle with this Epson. Heads are clogged more than 90% of the time. When it does work, I'm lucky if I can print just a few pages before I'm ""out"" of ink. In 2 years, I've printed a total of maybe 50 pages, yet I've had to replace the hi-capacity black ink twice and each of the colors twice. I figure I've paid about $8 per page. What a money pit."
3,Good printer lasted 6 years; died by clogged printhead,"The CX6600 endured light home use for 6 years. Then it started printing streaks. Replaced ink cartridges with no effect. Even bought some of that print-head cleaning solution to try and unclog the print head, which only partially fixed the problem. Looked online for a replacement for the printhead, and saw prices ~$150, which is the price I paid for a brand new Canon all-in-one.The Epson was a good printer for 6 years, so I can't complain too much. But it was frustrating to have the failure of a single part render the whole unit economically dead. Glad to see that my new Canon printer has the print-head itself as a user-replaceable part."
1,Good at first - sucks up ink - ink tubes dry up - do not buy,"At first the printer worked well and did a nice job printing. I then did not print for a few months and went back to use the printer. It printed terribly!!! I tried seven nozzle checks and seven head cleanings. I then called Epson, they sent me a refurbished printer. Again it worked well at the beginning. Now I am in the same boat. The ink has clogged in the printer again and it is not under warranty. I plan to write Epson to share my concerns. Don't get sold on the single ink cartridges either - the printer thinks it is out of ink and the cartidges are still a 1/3 full, yet the printer will not allow you to print.Bottom Line: If you print every day and like to spend a lot of money on ink this is the printer for you."
1,Works well for a while...then stops completely!,"I will not longer buy an Epson printer. This is the 4th Epson printer I have owned and had problems with. Maybe I should have stopped buying them a long time ago, but I didn't. In any case, I always thought that Epson's had great great print quality and they do. The only problem with them all is that the print heads stop working and there is no way that you can get them to start working again. No amount of cleaning the print heads, while using all of your ink during the cleaning, will make the printer print again. So, after buying multiple cartridges because of multiple cleanings, and replacing my printer four times in five years, I am completely fed up with Epson. Your best bet, and mine, will be to buy a Canon printer because with each new ink cartridge you replace, you also replace the print head, so it does not suck (all of your ink and money) like an Epson. Don't spend too much money on garbage."
2,"When it fails- call customer care, they will ship you a new one","Great printer, when it works. If it fails (prints only blank pages after changing cartridges) call tech support to establish yourself in their database. Tell tech support you purchased it just over 1 year ago (unless purchase was more recent). Go through the process, then when it still won't print, call their customer care (not tech support) at 562-276-1311. They will look you up in their support system, see you've already tried to resolve problem, and will offer a free replacement. It's at least worth a shot before buying something else.I've done all this today and waiting for my new 6600 to arrive in 3-4 days."
1,Clogged print heads after 15 months,"I tried the built-in ""Head Cleaning"" and even bought a cleaning solution from a third party. Neither worked and I wasted a tremendous amount of time on it :-/Otherwise, it was a fine printer. But, now it is fairly useless."
2,Good print quality - Poor software / driver,"The initial software and driver install went fine on my XP box. Then I attempted to install the driver on my Win2000 laptop in order to access the CX6600 as a shared printer (over cat5 based Ethernet). No luck so I called Epson tech support. The support rep had me try several things to get the printer to work as a shared device. By the time they gave up, the printer would no longer work even from my XP computer. The driver would say printer not ready even though the printer status said everything is fine.So the support rep basically says, ""sorry, nothing more I can do - have nice life.""Time to return the printer and of course unintall the printer software and drivers. What a mess - as others have reported. Uninstall does basically nothing. Manual directory deletion and removal of registry keys and values are required to clear out the software.A nice piece of hardware is handicapped by very poor software. What a shame."
2,Be prepared for a trip to the repair shop!,"We bought an Epson Stylux cx5200 last year, only to return it a couple of months later because it stopped working. We exchanged it for another, which we returned AGAIN a couple of months later because it, too stopped working. This time they replaced it with the CX6600, which we have had for a couple of months, and it is already sounding like the bathroom fan when it runs. Also have had several problems with printer heads/cleaning, etc. I do have to give it credit for the printing quality.....we have been pretty happy as far as that goes, but I'm pretty sure I will NEVER buy another epson. Unless it comes with DOOR TO DOOR service. Talk about a PAIN!!!!!!!"
4,The original Ant sound,Before Adam Ant took off to stardom this is what the Ants sounded like. After having heard a number of live tapes 1978-79 with some really good songs the Ants first release was the single Young Parisians which was as the english would say rather silly. Dirk wears white socks straightened it all out but success was limited. The album includes classic Ants tracks like Cleopatra and Never trust a man with egg on his face. For further listening try the Complete BBC recordings which includes additional early tracks.
4,Grit and Bare It,This is good stuff. It is indispensible for rounding edges on artistic stuff I do with a scroll saw.
2,Nantucket History and Travel Guide...,"This book was awful and painful to get through! Although it's a short book, it felt as though it would take me forever to finish... which is why I had to put it down. If you're thinking of taking a trip to Nantucket and want to know all of it's history and what it has to offer, then this may be the book for you. If you wanted a good, gripping true crime novel, then look up Tom Henderson, Ann Rule, M. William Phelps, Diane Fanning- PRETTY MUCH ANYONE OTHER THAN BRIAN MCDONALD! Bad writing out of what could have been made into a great book... BIG disappointment!"
3,Okay book but lacking...,"This book was wonderful in outlining Beth's life; however it was extremely lacking details about the ""psycho"" relationship between Beth and Toolan. Not enough details or pictures. The book describes many important pictures of Beth's accomplishments--but no photo is presented in the book. Thought it was written prematurely too."
3,"Another ""Run of the Mill"" Murder","There is nothing ""run of the mill"" about murder, or the victim in this case - a very successful and likeable young woman. Certainly one wishes it never happened.On the other hand, the story lacks mystery (we learn who did it in the first chapter), and goes on ad nauseum regarding the background of the area and those who formerly lived there.Bottom Line: Just another story of a psychotic killer with a history of excess drinking, losing jobs, and abusing women, who periodically manages to act acceptably and temporarily win others over, and in then in this case kills the person who at first thought she had found her ""Sir Gallahad."""
1,You've gotta be kidding me!,"The notion that I had a ""soprano"" voice at any point in middle school, not to mention the sheer absurdity of ANYONE calling me ""painfully shy"" are only two small items indicative of the lack of research that went into rushing this book to press. Of course, it's not about me,but it's a story that deserves to be told properly-not merely cobbled together with web page research......""painfully shy""-it is to laugh...."
3,Good stuff,This was once software you could rely on but because there are so many now that could be better it's really a personal preference with this software.
3,"Love it, but its too big for a 1.5"" hitch","Tried to find out before ordering what size hitch it was for. Saw ""2 hole adapter to fit most applications"" listed. Figured maybe it came with an adapter... NOPE.So now I have it, but need their adapter so it will fit on my hitch.Its good quality, just can't put it on my SUV just yet...."
5,The Container as the First Human Invention,"Around pp. 165-167, in the essay ""The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,"" LeGuin discusses the possibility that the first human invention was not the weapon, but the container -- the sling, the sack, the bag, the carrier. (I remembered it as ""the vessel,"" but that term doesn't appear in the book.) What good is generating a lot of stuff to eat if you don't have any way to get it back to camp? She argues the point persuasively and passionately.I read this book in 1991 or 1992, nearly 20 years ago. I've not seen the idea anywhere else (although she cites an anthropologist writing in 1975) but it has shaped my perception since. Not to diminish the rest of the book, but this single idea in this one essay is, I believe, worth getting the whole book for."
4,Menu Organizer is Handy,"It's a great tool to keep all those menus that float around the kitchen. My husband knows right where to find them all now. It probably could have used a few other categories, but easy to tailor it to what you want it to be."
3,Never received order,I love this movie. I was waiting for 3 weeks for the order and never received it. It sucks!
4,Beautiful Bavarian Alps,"Winter Sleepers is a film that still haunts me years after having first seen it. Set in a ski resort town in the Bavarian Alps, I recall first its beautiful aerial shots and second its beautiful actors costumed in color coded wardrobes, one always red, another always in soft forest green. Literally filmed sleeping often, but figuratively sleeping while awake, the characters remain unaware of common touch points in their lives. Like other films: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie by Bunnel and Hanna and Her Sisters by Woody Allen, it is painful to watch the narcissism which unfortunately provides a clear picture of contemporary society for reflection."
1,JUNK,"I bought this plastic cover after having my license plate and registration sticker removed from my car. Beware: these covers are made of cheap plastic that easily cracks and breaks. In addition, these covers are illegal in California and some other states. Not a good product."
4,Great band!,"This is a very good album. This band as a very nice pop sound ,with an electronic touch and a distinctive european feel. The song ""Play some rock"" as made an apparition on a canadian radio station (this is how a discover this band) and I had to go buy it right away! Very distinctives melodies ,go get it!"
2,Needs more flavor!,"I was disappointed in this product since their bread mix is so quick and easy and very good. First of all, it needs more flavor, which I intend to supplement with spices on future batches until it's gone. Next, it isn't crunchy, at least when oven baked. I prefer to use cornflake crumbs. Gluten-free cornflakes are available - check in health food stores. Just put the flakes in a plastic bag and run over with a rolling pin to get crumbs, add spices of your choice (I like a teaspoon each of paprika and salt plus 1/4 teaspoon pepper to 1/2 cup of crumbs), dip the chicken in egg, roll in crumbs and bake."
1,Big Disappointment,"Given the high quality of most Kinnikinnick products, I was sorely disappointed with the Chicken Coating Mix. Awful is the best I can describe it. Just awful. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Accomplishes it's purpose...,This book is intended to be an introduction to economics - macro and micro - for those who don't know what those two words are. It was an easy read - I would say enjoyable but reading economics books can't be too much fun can it? Not having any economics since college I wanted to get a refresher mostly because of the the way our country is racking up debt to simply help me make better decisions as a voter. I feel like this book did just that. Everything from inflation to the balance of supply and demand...
1,Amazon Eliminates Entire Movements from A Composition: BAD AMAZON!,"The greatest detriment and absolute dishonor to the recording is that for the MP3 downloads Amazon withholds entire movements.Does anyone have a clue as to why Amazon chooses to ruin otherwise wonderful sets of music?I love 20th century classical composers. Amazon seems to have complete disregard for the music of our recent masters.Bad. Very bad reasoning to cut a movement, an ENTIRE movement from a composition. Who decides to kill the composition?I give it a ONE star because Amazon seems to hate classical music. I love Janacek and the Sinfonietta is one of the greats.So what does the MP3 download service do for this amazing recording? They shove a knife into manuscript and arbitrarilydestroy it. It's like taking a book and cutting out the next to last chapter.Sinfonietta is Five Stars. The Whole Sinfonietta is 5 Stars, the butchered version just says go away."
5,OBAMA,"I was looking for a good book about President Obama's life story, and I found this DVD: President Barack Obama: The Man and His Journey. It comes out officially on Inauguration Day, January 20th, and documents both his personal story AND his remarkable campaign up until Election Day. It's really comprehensive; there are amazing interviews and also the beautiful Brian McKnight song for the campaign, ""Yes We Can"". If you've been wanting to know more about this incredible man, I recommend this DVD. I mean it's a keepsake, so I think it's definitely nice to have to look back on how we lived through such a historic election."
5,Wow! A great book for grandparents and grandchildren,"What a charming and interesting book! The book is made all the more interesting knowing that it was a collaboration between the young author and his artist father. We shared this book with our grandsons, ages 8 and 10. It is hard to capture their enthusiasm; suffice it to say it was a hit!"
3,"very interesting sound, but not quite my style","a good sound, a couple stand-out tracks but didn't impress me too much."
2,Don't waste your time. Fatal bugs.,"I found that the game has fatal bugs in it that are impossible to work around. In some scenarios in the campaign there are ruins you have to enter and if you kill a certain monster, which you have to of course, the game crashes to the desk top every time no matter what variation you try.Even if you don't play the campaign, which is mostly what people buy these games for, the combat system is more like something you would expect in a game from 10 or 15 years ago.It's too bad because it could have been a much better game with a very small amount of work. Developers should try playing some other games in the genre before they release these things."
2,Color selection wrong,"I order White album, however received Green. I called Adorama Camera and they said that they have no White albums."
2,Pockets too small,"I bought this album and 10 packets of refills to house our trip pictures to China when we adopted our daughter. I had over 1000 photos and when I started to try to insert them (TRY IS EMPHASISED) into the pockets I found them too tight and too small. I ended up having to cut each photo by 1/8 inch and use a shoe horn, no joke, to ease them in. The whole project took me days to complete. These albums and refills may be fine for a few pages but for any larger album project buy something else. I wouldn't have even bothered to write this review if I wasn't so pissed off."
4,Listings Needs Work,I only ordered this item because the listing said detachable blades. But once I received this item and opened the package which was really easy I saw that this item was more for a switchable clipper set rather then a detachable clipper set. Detachable is for screws that hold the blades to the clippers and switchable is for pop off - pop on blades. Returned and refunded TY
2,Stanley ain't what it used to be,"Bought it to throw into my helper's tool bag. Definetly not for precision work. Lock is flimsy, blade is thin, takes a lot of effort to set the blade depth to just where you want it. If you want a real block plane, go Veritas or Lie Nielsen!"
3,This is no Lie-Nielsen plane,"If you have some time and skill to fine tune this plane, it has the potential to be a useful tool. I was initially taken aback by how much refining the plane needed. I dont mean just honing. It comes with an edge that needs work before it can be honed to the point I would call it sharp. The other parts fit tightly, causing you to fight them just to make an adjustment. I expected better fit and finish. I like a plane, or any other tool to work smoothly, like it was passed down to you from your grandfather.It isn't something that a little time and patience can't fix. And I suppose that you could make the argument that this fine tuning will make you more familar and thus more confident with this tool.All in all, it's worth the price. Just plan on breaking it in."
3,"Good cast of actors, but watch the age group","The stories are the ones you already know. Children under 5 don't appreciate this as much as I thought they would. It would not hold their attention at all. Movies like Toy Story did hold their attention. The stories were a little dry. I give it a lower rating because we could not get the second disk to play. My player is fine. I never had this experience ever, with a brand new disk. There are no scratches on it. I had to keep skipping ahead until we finally got it to start. This indicates that the manufacturing process for the DVD disks is poor. The other disks play fine. I would recommend this for children between 5 and 9 years old."
3,Missing components,"Had watched this as a kid, so was eager to buy it. Plus the low price and free gifts along with were further incentives.However, am not very pleased with what I got.For starters, didn't receive the 3 in 1 card game.The quality of the picture is not that great, and there are no subtitles.I haven't watched all the Faerie Tales yet, but the Pied Piper of Hamlin had a scene cut(the rat's explanation of the music). Makes me wonder if the other stories have scenes which have been edited out too.It gets 3 stars because its Faerie Tale Theatre."
4,would like a higher quality image,"I love this series, the episodes of which are essentially plays of the fairy tales in which the characters are portrayed by well-known movie and TV stars. However, I was hoping that the film quality would be better than it is. Even with an ""upconverting"" blu ray player, the videos are not as good as one would hope, at least not on a 50"" tv. I would love to see these remastered onto blu ray disks in HD quality. I think there would definitely be a larger audience for a higher quality version."
2,You Can't Go Home Again,"I received the Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection but was sadly disappointed. It was nice to see many famous actors before they attained greatness but it at the same time, viewing the various faerie stories was not as I remembered. It just proves the point that past experiences of one's youth tend to take on a patina of nostalgia that does not relate to the original experience. ""You can't go home again"" is definitely true."
5,Great deal for the full collection!,"I am so excited that these movies are now available again. I grew up watching them. My sister and I would play the dancing princesses over and over. We never saw the full collection, but made it through quite a few of them and each time was fun and enjoyable. I do, however, remember some of the movies being a bit freakish, as many fairy tales generally are. Hansel and Gretel scared me to death when I was younger, but other than a few scary moments these movies are great. I would say that each movie should be carefully considered according to the ages of those watching. Some may be too scary for five yearolds for instance. Ultimately run out and get this collection. It holds so many fond memories for me."
5,Classic,Shelley Duvall and her all-star cast bring these tales to life with wit and humor seldom seen on film or TV.I recommend them to all but the very young.
4,The Sweet Invention of a Child's Dream,"I have been watching Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre since I was very young, and now am delighted that all her wonderful plays (although I have to admit the Three Little Pigs is definetely her best) is finally on DVD in a full collection. These classic stories are pleasant to watch for any age, and my mom has never hesitated to show them to her second graders, but she also took pleasure in them herself. I recommend this set for any lover of fairy tales, or dreamer of dreams, I promise you won't be dissapointed."
5,Quality,Received this in a timely fashion! Very quality product still in shrink wrap. Very satisfied customer. DVD brings back good memories!!!
1,Missing Farro,"I never recieved this item. I wrote the company and told them but they never replied. Soooo, I can't tell you how it is."
3,Refreshing renditions of Disney's songs,"For Disney lovers, this CD will breathe a new life of the familiar Disney songs you've known before.Best songs in this CD (at least for me) are: A Whole New World (Nick Lachey & Jessica Simpson), Proud of Your Boy (Clay Aiken), A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes (Kimberley Locke), When You Wish Upon A Star (Jesse McCartney) and Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah (Aly & AJ)."
3,I wanna tear Jump 5 apart...,"My only real complaint with this CD is Jump 5's version of Hawaiian Rollercoaster Ride.Although a catchy tune, they need to realize that they are not Hawaiian, and have not, and will never be able to pull of singing in Hawaiian, especially after the Kamehameha School in Hawaii did such a beautiful job. On top of that, they got many of the pronounciations wrong.Having lived in Hawaii for three years, and getting to know the culture, and the fact that their music is so wonderful, I am thouroughly disappointed with Jump 5's rendition.I have been a Jump 5 fan for a long time, but this just killed it. The truth is, I think now they should quit while they are a head, and not kill the beautiful music that belongs Hawaii."
1,Never got mine to work... I had to return it.,"After hooking up my mouse and installing the latest software off the Kensington website, I could not get this mouse to work. Tried fresh batteries, tried different USB ports, tried everything Kensington asked to no avail... So I took it back.The buttons and the rubber grip felt great. The buttons had a strong tactical feel and the rubber does not make your hand slip like on other Kensington designs. The software is very robust and highly customizable for Mac OS X too. At a store price of $30, it's not a bad deal, assuming you can find one that works. I opted to try another Microsoft mouse since I've been used to using one for several years now."
2,doesn't track well,"I bought this mouse as a traveling laptop mouse, and haven't been especially impressed. The software included with the mouse overwrote my laptop's touchpad driver, rendering it useless. The mouse is also unbalanced, which (I believe) causes it to not track correctly, as it stutters quite a bit and sometimes hops across the screen. I'd suggest looking elsewhere, possibly at a Microsoft mouse instead."
5,A MUST HAVE book for any family.,"This is truly a must have book for any family.If you are like most people you do not get enough fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. Jill Nussinow's recipes in this book are mouth watering and very delicious. These recipes will make the vegetables the ""feature"" at dinner time.I love all the interesting tid bits and cooking tips that Jill spreads out throughout the book.You will never think vegetables are boring once you have tried some of the recipes in this great book.Jill also has a great DVD available on her site,[...] called Pressure Cooking: A Fresh Look at Delicious Dishes in Minutes. This is another MUST HAVE! She teaches you a lot about pressure cookers and teaches you some amazing recipes.You can read my blog review by clicking here: http://shescribes.blogspot.com/2009/01/love-your-veggies-with-veggie-queen.html."
1,false advertising,"don't get me wrong, this is a great song. but there's only the one song here. the album version of threesome. the product description says there's a live version of threesome and a live version of a song for everyone. plus the video for threesome. this is misleading and i am very disappointed. i have the album lechuza, where this song comes from, so i basically just wasted $2.50 plus $2.50 for shipping for one song i already have."
3,Too bad,"A co-worker told me about this product and how it had worked for her daughter and husband. Another co-worker was actually using it and claimed it helped her. I bought this for my son and myself because I wanted to stop using the Cortisone-10 Eczema lotion because of the steroid. I was hopeful that this would work for us, but it did not even in the slightest. I also gave a tube for my sister-in-law to use for my niece, but she said it didn't help her either. So we continue to use the Cortisone-10 which does help a lot and still searching for something without a steroid in it. I've tried a lot of things, but nothing has helped as much as the C-10."
2,Dissappointed,"I bought this in hopes that it would help relieve the itch associated with PUPPS, but it didn't give me much relief, not even temporarily. Moreover, I didn't like the smell of the product. I haven't used this product to treat other type of rashes or itch so I don't know how effective it is - it just didn't work for me. Plus, it took a long time for this product to be shipped to me by the vendor so by the time I received it, I was dissappointed it not only arrived late, it wasn't effective."
2,Poor Fit,"I wanted a casual shoe to wear with jeans. When I put these shoes on, I felt the heal coverage was too low. They felt like they were slipping off my foot."
1,A great buy if...,"You are a religious person who has failed to communicate with the person you are in a relationship with since the day you met. The description of this book fails to mention any religious nonsense that fills this book. Reading through the comments after purchasing is the only place that this theme can be found and it is on this basis that I have returned the book to Amazon for a full refund. If you are not a devout Christian, don't buy this book."
5,Very pleased with this cart,"I ordered this for my grandpa who just recently had his gallbladder removed. He has since been healing, but is unable to drag and/or lift anything even remotely heavy. This cart is perfect for him so he can cut the grass and do yardwork and use this."
3,Leaf Cart,THIS IS A HANDY CART...BUT I FELT IT WAS NOT AS LARGE AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED. DO BE CAREFUL OF THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE BAG...AS THEY CAN BE LOST .ALSO YOU MUST BE CAREFUL OF THE FRAME AS IT IS PLASTIC...AND CAN BREAK EASILY I AM AFRAID.
2,"Disappointingly flimsy, unstable","This cart is adequate (I guess) for light filling by hand but leaves much to be desired even for that. It offers virtually no lateral support to the plastic leaf bag; thus, as the bag begins to fill, it can pop off the plastic clips holding it to the top of the cart. (It took only one use to lose two of those clips which now lie either somewhere in the yard or at the bottom of a leaf bag in some land fill!) At that point, the cart can tip over and/or spill the bagged debris. It is entirely too flimsy and unstable to be used for emptying a blower/vac bag. The opening is too small and any downward weight on the top of the cart will cause it to roll out from under your vac bag and fall over.I strongly recommend spending your money instead on one of the Fiskar's Kangaroo collapsible leaf bags -- especially the one with the hard shell bottomFiskars 9413 30-Gallon Hard Shell Base Kangaroo Gardening Container. You can thank me later."
4,Strength from within,"Blackbird, by Jennifer Lauck was selected reading for discussion in our local Book Club. I immediately fell in love with Jenny, the main character and narrator. She was wise beyond her years and had such strength! Many parts of this book were sad and Jennifer Lauck successfully balances this with humor and unexpected kindness. It reminded me that little people are often much more intuitive,graceful and intelligent than the adults that surround them. It was a great story on many levels."
4,Poor Baby!,"This is a memoir of someones life that you would want to wrap your arms around and say ""There There it is going to be ok""After closing the book you then realize this little girl was not completely aware of everything she was experiencing ""Until"" she became an adult and looked back. The resilency and resourcefulness of oppressed spirits is truly a mercy from the Creator."
3,Very simple words and phrases to remember,This is a very basic introduction to spanish words and phrases that will help you to get into basic conversations. It will let spanish speaking natives know that you are trying to learn their language and will make them more appreciative of your efforts.I especially find the restaurant and transportation/directions information very useful and will use this information in my trip to mexico next week.
2,"The MC5 through a long, noisy tunnel","""Archive"" releases are a double-edged sword. Yeah, it's cool to get a live cd of the 5, but damn, this sounds like it was recorded with a boombox OUTSIDE of the venue where the 5 were kickin' 'em out, dig? Tape speed is messed up, too, on some tracks Tyner sounds about 300 pounds heavier than he did normally. Killer version of ""Shakin' Street"" is a saving grace, but unless you're a FANATIC, avoid this at all costs. You want a killer live MC5 recording, pick up Thunder Express (live in the studio, tight as hell)."
1,Terrible Sound.....,"The sound quality here renders this album unlistenable to even the most devout MC5 fan. I strongly advise saving your cash here and spending your hard earned money on the new ""Purity, Accuracy"" box set. You can get it here on zShops for almost half off the list and it is worth every single cent."
3,subpar sound quality,My only complaint is that... I can hear the other language version in the background... I dont understand how this could be... but it screams cheap quality.
1,Not So Great,"The product I received was in Japanese/Chinese instead of English and did not contain the entire set. One of the DVDs had been replaced with a Christmas DVD, non related to what I had ordered. I have asked for the set to be replace with an English speaking version. So far, I have not heard from the provider nor have I received a refund."
5,"""Systems Survival Guide"" Michele M. Pavlyak",Excellent resource for anyone considering a systems change. Steps are outlined in a thoroughly logical and easy to understand manner. Contains all the pertinent information needed to have a successful software systems changeover.
4,Crackling Fireplace Video 3 Pack,"I have never written a review on this site before but feel compelled to write this one. A few weeks ago I purchased all three videos of this series. I was a little uneasy about buying anything online but did so anyway, and I'm VERY pleased that I did. I am going to buy all three Crackling fire tapes again as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. These videos are just great to read my books by, its like having a real fire! I would recommend them."
4,"Seems to hold as good as charge as Canon OEM battery, after initial break-in period","Very low price, thought it might not hold up well. At very first, the battery lost its power quickly. But after using it several times over a few days, fully charging it after depleting it fully, the battery seems to hold a good solid charge, comparable to the Canon OEM battery that I still have."
2,One minor R&B hit...,"Best cut here is the first single 'Baby can't leave it alone'; a smoldering groove featuring compelling lyrics about a drug-addicted woman. Very nice song, although not groundbreaking(see Stevie Wonder's cut 'Too High' from the Innervisions CD). The other cuts on the album are far less appealing. Repetitive, cookie cutter beats and choruses (Don't Cry, Sweet Melody) and bland, melancholy ballads(My World, High Desert Woman) abound on this CD. Small wonder that we haven't heard anything from him since. He does have this raspy thing in his voice that is strangely appealing. I think some people might call it hissy like a snake, or maybe even froggy. Interesting, but its not awe-inspiring or powerful. But if you're a dedicated fan of neo-soul(I hate that title), and if you like listening to music by under-the-radar artists, or if you just liked the debut single and the voice, you might not mind investing in the whole disc. Everybody else: I'd try to get the single."
3,The best of the trilogy,"I really did not expect to like Rachel at all, but Raleigh delves below the surface to present a woman the reader can like. She's not quite as self-centered and vain as she appeared in the other books. Anthony is a very nice hero who knows exactly how to handle her. The secondary romance was a little awkward for me. The story of the Devilish Dandy and all three Cresswell sisters is nicely wrapped up, giving the trilogy a sense of completion.Raleigh does sometimes wreak havoc with the English language, her characters are not the most inspired, nor her plots the the most engrossing. Neither is her emotional content anywhere near the level of, say, Mary Balogh. But Raleigh can spin an enjoyable yarn, and this book is just right for a few hours of light reading."
2,Limited Interest,"A very easy read with one-dimensional characters of most interest, I should think, to those familiar with Boston and Chatham."
1,RIPPED OFF,"I loved the song ""Don't Come Around Here"", but expected a full CD, NOT 3 SONGS! One of them ""Cupid""!?!?!?! All I've seen are overpriced."
5,Willie and P,willie and pals. I really like Willie Nelson and like all three of the Highwayman albums. All four members are superstars of country and other fields. There are some group songs like highwayman as well as songs by each artist. A classic album by four classic singers
4,Full Circle,I like the exposure to other musicians and the fact that the album was one take is impressive to say the least.
3,Grey Blues,"Love you Walter. But like all of us you're losing the battle with time and gravity. Two stars are for notstalgia, one is for your unquestionable authenticity. The one you didn't get is for an abscence of stinging tobasco that is usually found in your blues-rock brew. I'm glad I bought it and I will defintely be returning to the album on days when I notice a few extra lines on my face."
5,Blues cd,"If you are truly a ""blues"" lover, and enjoy blues music, then this cd is one that you need to add to your collection."
3,NOT EXACTLY WALTER TROUT!,"This CD is for Walter Trout fans who want all his stuff, even if he is joined by other artists. If you are expecting that nice raw heavy blues that is Walter's trademark, you will be in for a big letdown. He is so much better than his guests! His singing--and even his speed guitar playing--saves this offering from the garbage heap. WORKING OVERTIME, with Jeff Healey, and CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON, with Joe Bonamassa, are standouts: Trout's kind of material. WHEN WILL IT EVER CHANGE, WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER, and CAN'T HELP FALLING APART sound good to me. Some bad points: Eric Sardinas, who's great with his Johnny Winter style, is wasted on a boring acoustic cut. The last track is a DJ taking, with some backgroung music. You see what I mean. We are the ones who have to pay for these throw away selections! The audio is very good. Buy it to complete your Trout collection. If you're new to Walter's music, get GO THE DISTANCE, it may be his best effort."
4,still looking for an identity,"Is it just me, or does the title track of this album sound exactly like ""Footloose""? It is obvious that this is one of SCC's earliest releases. He is still mired in a very generic, ordinary sound. He has not yet found his musical wings, although as a lyricist he has started to shine.At this stage Chapman has already found how to transfer his passion to paper, but hasn't quite figured out how to bring it to the microphone. While technically sound, the music and his vocals are still quite stiff and uninspired. Hey, you have to start somewhere, and this does at least hint of good things to come.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
1,Dated album,This albums sound is very dated and nothing really stands out on this disc. I like some of SCC songs but I just couldnt get into this album that sounds like early 80s ripoffs of some secular artists.
2,Very frustrated with this book and its missing files,"I was extremely frustrated with this book when I sat down to use it, inserted the CD-ROM, and, after some time, realized that very important files were missing (including an index page that other pages supposedly linked to). Not only that, there was nothing indicating any kind of support on the publisher's web site! I can understand publishers being in a hurry to get these books out to the public in a timely manner, but when the whole point is having a CD to work with, this kind of sloppiness is unforgivable. I will even admit that if I'd had a place to vent to the publisher I might not be writing this review here."
2,"Good information, but...many errors","There is a lot of useful information in this book. It is obvious that Ms. Peck knows what she is talking about, has used Dreamweaver and is speaking from experience. Unfortunately, there are many errors in the tutorial exercises that are presented in the book. This makes them very frustrating to do and defeats their purpose. In addition, there needs to be more realistic projects/examples to demonstrate the concepts nd principles. Because of the many errors, I would not buy a book from her again."
2,Holes didn't line up,Very disappointing. Just bought more at local craft store. Holes didn't line up and hard to put in album. sorry
2,albums and inserts,"ONE THING I CAN SAY IS THIS: I ORDERED M46 ALBUMS AND INSERTS FOR THIS ALBUM---I HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS ORDER. THEY CHARGED ME TOO MUCH ON SHIPPING THESE ALBUMS. I CALLED SO MANY TIMES ABOUT THIS, ALSO THE M46 INSERTS DIDN'T MATCH THE ALBUMS AND I HAD OVER 3,000 PHOTOS TO WORK WITH AND PUT IN THE 6 ALBUMS I RECEIVED. IT TOOK ME 2 WEEKS TO DO THIS BIG JOB I HAD, NOT NOTICING THE INSERTS DIDN'T MATCH THE ALBUMS. FINALLY I DID RECEIVE 24.00 CREDIT FOR OVERCHARGE ON THE INSERTS. I WAS TO RECEIVE A 30.00 CREDIT ON MY NEXT ORDER FROM AMAZON- I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING ON THIS IN AN EMAIL.......SO, IF YOU ORDER FROM AMAZON-WATCH-BECAUSE THE ORDERS DON'T ALWAYS COME FROM AMAZON''''''''''I LEARNED THE HARD WAY---WHERE IS MY 30.00 CREDIT//Pioneer Photo Albums MP46-BAB Full Size Album 4 x 6 6 per Page, 300 Photo Bay BlueCHECK WHAT I WAS CHARGED'''''''"
2,I need help,"It is not what I thought it would be. In the same order I ordered a Photo Album and I thought that these were refill pages for that album. When they got here I saw that they were not for the album that I ordered. It would have cost me more money to return them, then what they are worth. What I am really looking for is for photo pages that fit into a regular 3 ring binder. I am doing Family Tree books, and I would like to insert pictures that I have into a 3 ring binder. Could you please help!!"
1,had to return it,"Had to return it. Service staff were VERY helpful but the print head did NOT work on our plotter, so we had to scramble and get one locally, and are still waiting to confirm our refund happened."
4,Fast,Great shape came in the mail faster than I expected No scratches on the disk and it was used all together good review great product
4,Great,"Just great. The new one is better but this is very good classic Common. Also you get Common without Kanye West whose helium voice choruses are distracting. It has this good vibe that's kind of seventies. It reminds me of hat feeling you have at a cookout with your best friends. A good time without violence, misogyny, or self denial that you hear in most rappers' lyrics. It has that good kind of honesty without sounding like he's trying to hard. If you compare ""G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition)"" to Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"" the difference shows. Common sounds a lot more insightful and honest. That sums up his lyrics about anything."
4,ok...,"to me this is common's third best album.ressurrection is number one and like water for choclate is number two.retrospect for life with lauryn hill is one of his top 3 songs he's ever been involved with though (just amazing).common's great-every album has a different feel to it.i'd take ressurrection over this just because i think he was at his absolute freshest then and ""i used to love h.e.r."" may be the greatest song in hip hop history.i'd take like water for choclate over this because of the production and overall feel of the album.this is still a must have for any common/hip hop fan though."
5,Mr. Lynn Has Done It Again,"Common is the best emcee ever. That's quite an audacious statement, I know. Yet, speaking as a hip-hop purist, I've never heard another artist bring so many issues to the table with such eloquence as does Common [Sense]. Life, death, education, abortion, religion, urban blight - all covered in this outstanding thrid album. Coupled with Com's lyricism (not to mention NO I.D.'s production, Sinister's scratches, and the presence and artistic diversity of guest contributers De La Soul, Lauryn Hill, Cee-Lo, Erykah Badu, Black Thought, Q-Tip, Canibus, Chantay Savage, and ""Pops"" Lynn) this album has affected me more than any other...ever. Folks, I cried through ""Retrospect for Life"" and ""G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition)""! Why Common [Sense] isn't more respected in the hip-hop community, I don't know, but I pray that ""one day it will all make sense."""
1,Save your time and effort,... It was so out of alinement and out of plane that any amount of tuning couldn't salvage it...
5,non-sequiter humor at its most profound,For awhile I just didn't get Zippy but once I did...this collection of Zippy comics is one of my all time favorites!
2,Blah!,"SimCity 2000 was far and away one of the most addicting games I had ever played. Well, when I heard that SimCity 3000 was coming out, I could not wait to see what kind of improvements they had made. Well, imagine my surprise when I had found that this great game series had actually taken a step back in terms of gameplay. The visuals in the new SimCity are fantastic though. I love being able to zoom on down to street level and see the people walking down the sidewalk and [stuff] piling up in people‚Äôs yards, but this does not make up for the lack of enjoyment I feel when I play this game. It seems like no matter what I do in this game, the industrial areas just continue to get filthy and look [bad]. Perhaps this game really is more of a challenge than the original in that respect, but I‚Äôll stick to the ease and fun of the original anyday!"
3,"Okay, but 2000 lead greater improvements","The new version of Sim City is cool but simply doesn't offer the satisfaction that Sim City 2000 offered. It really feels more like a nasty version of Sim City 2000 with new buildings. Still, everyone who loves Sim City will probably like this game all the same."
3,A great game that's too needy,"Believe it or not, this is a great game...........great content within quite an interactive interface. The news ticker at the bottom of the screen IS better than an interrupting swirling newspaper, as in the previous version. The graphics are superb if your running a G3 or better. However, when I first bought the game I was disappointed by how MUCH memory was needed just to load it. Don't kid yourself--you'll need 96 megs built-in if you want to take advantage of all the game's features. It took forever, and I do mean forever, to install. And it runs increasingly (and frustratingly...) slower as your city increases in size. I would love to give this game a 5-star rating, but it doesn't deserve it. You need a supercomputer to run the thing, and you better pray to the Big Guy if you have any problems; Maxis' online help is just terrible. However, if you are prepared to beef up your mac to testosterone-infected levels, this game IS very fun and fulfilling."
3,"Fine album, but there's no Cadaveria","This album is the first Opera IX album after they split with Cadaveria, their female growl vocalist.Music is fine, maybe even better than their previous materials, production is good, but without Cadaveria's vocals, Opera IX has lost it's authentic occult atmosphere.That is why I prefer listening to their older releases although they were awfully produced."
5,Still my favorite dance song of all time!,I can't believe this song never got popular outside the Tampa club scene. This song and Take My Love are the best!!! I still have my CD's and downloaded them to my Ipod. Mon A Q - wherever you are - you're the best!!!
5,The right one,"I must have read every review out there on bench vises when it came time to buy one for my new bench. I picked this one and I am very pleased! The quick release mechanism works like a champ, vise has nice wide jaws, and the price was very reasonable. I had read about the packaging being shoddy; well, they must have fixed that because my vise arrived with a very heavy duty box. For anyone out there that might be agonizing about which vise to buy: get this one!"
5,Great!,"This is the best wood working vise that I have ever used, and I use it a LOT. It did not come with wooden jaws, but adding them was no problem as the jaw plates are predrilled. It is large enough to hold anything that a furniture-maker or hobbyist would need, and the slip screw makes working with it a breeze. I wish that I had owned this 20 years ago!"
3,Great looking bootie,Unfortunately it has a seam right across the back heel that makes it unwearable for me. Too bad as it is so cute.
5,Amazing,"My favorite book, hands down. I have read this through completely many dozens of times, and re-read favorite passages regularly. Very well-written, evocative, beautiful, simply a great book. Anytime I need an escape, or a recharge, I pick this book up and read a few paragraphs or pages. I highly, highly recommend this book."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I love Alcatrazz with Malsteam or Vai, but his 2011 release is a big disappointment. Disk 1 is the same as the original release except the last song was reduced by 2 minutes. It got cut off during Vai's solo. All songs on disk 2 are bootlegged quality. It sounds like the record company just copied these songs from the live video concert. Poor Job."
4,very nice product,works as advertised ...I am not sure if will last 3x's as long as 'standard' belt ...which would justify the cost for these premium belts.
1,Needs work,"They ask you to create a Web Site in one way, and then after a while they say, if you haven't created your site this way, you might not get this result. Page 206 will ask you to create a Web Site under the Default Web Site. But on page 546, they say ""For the purposes of this example, I will be using the Interknowlogy site that we have created earlier in this book......Also, this example assumes the site is am isnatnce of the Web Server and not just a virtual directory under Default Web Site"". Author spends too much time for the Installation, but the installation instructions from Microsoft site is updated. The title should for this book should be ""Teach Yourself Site Server in 3 Days"""
4,Okay,"After I read Eight Cousins, which I loved, of course I decided to read this book. The book is about Rose, and her life as a woman, & her relationships with her male cousins. The book wasn't as good as Eight Cousins, and much more confusing.I would suggest that you only read this book after you have read Eight Cousins, because the starts right away, with no intro, so Eight Cousins prepares you.ENJOY!!!"
2,"poor product, company would not stand by it's own product","Bought this item, seems like a good idea but it's not a good long term house for Martins. In the last spring we had high winds, bent the cheap pole that was supplied by the company, they refused to replace it stating the wind could not have bent it,I even sent pictures, but then they would not reply. Took the bent mess down through it all in the Trash where it belonged, put up aT14 have raised Martins successfully now for five years"
1,not an introductory tex,"I rarely write these reviews. But this is a truly terrible book. Very few worked examples and no answeres to odd or even problems. Several of the problems at the end of chapters are not easily solved based on the information (often cursory) provided in the text. This is a poor learning tool for introductions to open channel hydraulics and design. I have a 4.0 GPA, I will make it throught this course, but this text stands alone as possibly the worst I have ever used."
2,"A developers dream, a gamers 'meh'",This offers an intriguing story and a couple of clever plot devices. It didn't set the world on fire when it was released and it isn't a must play game.If you have played other RPG's like Deus Ex you will find several hours of solid entertainment in playing it.
2,"Good idea, not so good implementation","I bought one of these looking for a lightweight, easy to use sander for my bed/bath redecorating project. The grit paper it came with was just what I needed, and I bought extra as I had two bath vanities and a windowsill to refinish, plus lots of spackled holes to sand down.Although the sander is comfortable to hold and use, I was CONSTANTLY opening up the clip on the pointy end to reseat the sandpaper. Every time you put a little pressure on the thing, the sandpaper would pop out. I tried refolding the paper, new paper, repositioning the paper deeper into the clip, nothing worked. I think I spent more time fixing this thing than I did using it. Look elsewhere for a sander."
2,NOT SO HOT,"Disappointing. Very little written about Annie Palmer and why she became the evil person she was. No mention of the slaves she bedded and killed. Punctuation, when present, was misplaced and distracting."
3,Different,I was told about this book from a cab driver in Jamaica. I bought it thinking it was nonfiction. It is based on fact but it is not nonfiction. It does give an incite on what really went on in Jamaica. That was a real eye opener. I wouldn't recommend friends to buy it but would offer to let them read it.
3,Rose Hall's White Witch,This book is pretty good. There are some grammatical errors but all in all this is a fun book.
5,GLENN MILLER,"Just what I was looking for..great price, perfect condition. Fast service.Awesome CD and would order again from this seller!!!"
5,Perfect Fit,Glad I didn't have to buy another cooler just because the hinges broke. Simple to install. Just unscrew the old ones and screw in the new ones. Comes with everything you need. Hope these ones last longer than the originals! (Originals lasted over 3 years)
5,Perfect,"Exactly what you'd expect. As far as I can tell they're factory parts, the same ones on retail-sold coolers. I replaced a broken hinge in my 4 year old 5-Day Extreme cooler and you can barely tell the difference. I was afraid removing the old screws would strip the holes but the new ones screwed in nice and tight, no issues."
4,Good Value For Its Purpose,"We bought this for our 11 year old daughter and it's perfect for her. It is portable, provides good sound and also charges while the IPod is docked. This IPod dock is a good value for the price. It can be plugged into the wall or run on batteries. It has several IPod adapters and even has a jack for video output. If your looking for more serious sound quality (with less portability) I would recommed the iLive IHT3817DT which we purchased for our older daughter.iLive 2.1-Channel Speaker Bar with iPod Dock (Black)"
1,ruined my ipod,I bought this product in black for my son's 2nd generation ipod nano. We plugged it in using the apprpriate bracket and then the ipod screen turned dark and will no longer respond at all. A $30 product ruined a $150 product. great
2,Hard to call this rock...,"Borrowed this album from a friend to see what all the hype was about. I was left unimpressed. People have claimed that it stands up well to today's CCM, but I disagree. It may have held up for much of the 90's, but it sounds too light, almost weak in comparison.Sorry, too many synthesizers and echoing vocals for my taste. Not enough beefy guitars to be considered rock. If one likes 80's pop music though, I can see how this album could be tolerated."
4,Hott . . .,"This cd is a good cd. ""Make her feel good"" and ""No Daddy"" were great singles. They are true and have a good beat! So stop hating!"
3,Not bad,"its really not a bad album...u just gotta look past her age. a lot of people are putting her age factor into this album but u know what, its the real world, people younger than her use foul language so why can't she? anyways, the girl can sing her ass off thats a given and her slow songs like Phonebooth...INCREDIBLE, also Stay in Ya Lane and Lala, great songs...she just needs to be polished. She's not gonna be to Roc-A-Fella what Ashanti was to Murder Inc. but she can come close...but make it know Ashanti is still the baddest bitch in the RnB game! Ashanti new album out Summer 2006!"
4,Average,This CD wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special. I had no problem listening to it all the way through on the first try. CD wasn't bad for what it was worth.
3,Guilty pleasure.,"This album has some catchy material. If I had to describe this CD in two words, it would be guilty pleasure. Her voice is nothing special, just a notch above Ashanti's. But she makes this CD work, with standout tracks like ""New (...)"" and ""Stay In Ya Lane."" But there are still some mediocre songs on here. ""No Daddy"" for example. (And don't ask me why they decided to put a remix of it at the end, which is even worse than the original.)"
1,"The whining generation of ""R&B Stars""","It's not a typo, I said WHINING, not WINNING. These singers whine! Amerie and Alicia Keys are the only truth for contemporary female R&B; stars and Keyshia Cole barely makes the non-whiners list. Even Solange's Solo Star 2003 CD sounds better than most of these carbon-copy Ashanti ""chant-singing"" whiners and she gets slept on because her older sister Beyonc√© gets all the media attention and promotion!!I just don't understand why R&B; vets like 'face (Babyface), Jon B., Toni Braxton, Mint Condition, Stevie Wonder (YET HAVE ALL GOOD NEW CDS RELEASED IN 2005!!) get slept the fcuk on!If it wasn't for these vets, half of you muppet babies wouldn't have even been born!!!! That's what's up; real talk, baby!!Izzy"
1,amy bento hi/low dynamics,This was hard to follow. I do lots of workouts and I felt I was just jumping in this workout. No good directions. I would skip purchasing these in the future.
1,WMD Perspective Behind the Times,"Mr. Campbell's work, written as part of his current doctoral thesis at Hebrew University, falls behind the times regarding the rapid paced developments in the field of weapons of mass destruction. His socio-scientific approach stems from this works academic research requirement which was spun off as a coffee table book treatment of this important field. Well researched concerning nuclear weapons, but falling seriously behind in his regards concening biological or chemical weapons. I would recommend this book for those that need a very, very basic, primer concerning nuclear weapons but nothing more."
4,Don't Get Played,"An intriguing drama filled story of life in an HBCU. Love, hate, betrayal, and redemption are just a few of the many issues to arise from the story. The charcaters are so richly brought to life that you will easily relate them to someone in your own life. A great story of players get played."
1,"Weak, Soulness Latin Vibe","Don't bother adding this to your Latin and/or Lounge collection. The mood is overly electronic and sterile. Percussions sounds like choppy programming, melodies are subtley trite, and vocals are less than soulful. This is a sleepy, wimply collection of elevator music disguised in chic packaging by some industry people. You're much better off going with the Carlos Campos collections, Barcelona Tribe (B-Tribe), or the Havana-esque work of Up Bustle and Out."
4,good,When Karen is in a Thanksgiving play she gets the worst part of all! The turkry.Then she dose somthing to ake her part more exciting. But that only leads to trouble. Read #13.
4,this is really interesting...,"could just surprise everybody, this record. Like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, but Dave Matthews and Three Dog Night too...a little bit of Grand Funk Railroad. This guy cares. very interesting. this is real rock and roll."
5,Great Gospel music,"CD was in pristine condition. It actually arrived a couple days ahead of the estimated delivery. The music is just as I remembered it, excellent. A very satisfied customer."
4,"Great Hardware, Awful Software","This is a really handy scanner. It grabs the pages nicely and feeds through smoothly and straight. The ""leatherette"" carrying case is a nice addition, and I feel confident that I can stuff it in my computer bag and have it emerge in one piece (as I have done already a number of times).My gripe is that the software is truly awful. Granted, you don't have to use it, it's a standard TWAIN device, but most people don't have a better alternative handy. I've been suffering through it since I don't really use the unit more than once or twice a week, but more frequent users are going to want a better replacement (maybe Adobe Acrobat)."
1,Horrible customer Service Be prepared,"I orderd a Brother DS 600 Scanner from ANTOnline. On arrival I tried every method known to install this scanner and it would not install. It has conflicts with other imaging devices.When trying to return a defective product, we were denied!I filed a complaint with Visa and will file a complaint with Amazon.ANTonline finally issued an RMA, but wants me to pay to have their bad product returned.This should never be a fight. ANTonline will not be getting return business from me.I am an I'T' professional and know what I'm dealing with.If given the choice, I highly recommend you use a different company."
5,Best Portable Scanner for Trade Show Use,We have put 5 of these scanners into use at showsite and it has been a quick and easy solution for getting clean compressed file copies of paperwork back to the corporate office. Setup is easy for non-techy people and using it is even easier.
1,Not for Mac's,Purchased two work and home . Works great with PC did download for Mac off web site could not get installed on Mac :(. Returned one and purchased Scansnap S300 by Fujitsu twice as much but if does all it says well worth it! It will save time and money and frustration!
1,Could not install the scanner,"The scanner may have been defective because I could not install it on the computer. I tried three different desktop/laptops with windows xp and 7. None of them worked. All computers detected a USB scanner but none were able to install the driver for it. I even downloaded the most updated software from Brother's website, still did not work. I sent the scanner back to Amazon which did not have an exchange option."
4,"Great scanner, slightly difficult feed","I purchased the Pentax DSMobile600 scanner to scan multi-page documents, some as pressure paper copies, into my laptop, running Windows Vista Professional, and it works well. The small size and light weight make it fit easily into my computer bag. Black and white scanned images are very sharp; contrast and brightness can be adjusted to scan even the faintest of copies (most of my scans are black and white, so I can't attest to color properties). Scanning speed is great for a mobile scanner; the the software's ability to scan into several formats is a great plus.The only problem that I have with this scanner is that the documents have to be precisely positioned for accurate feed. Documents often get hung up on a small lip created by the union of the upper and lower plastic parts in the feed slot, slowing the process of scanning. Otherwise, this is a great scanner."
2,incompetant,"it must be at least 4 weeks since we ordered this item....have you seen it ??? well, we haven't !!!! i am deeply dissapointed, and you have set my office systems back for at least a month...it will take another month to catch up on our scanning....hope you get my message, and by the way, WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE PRODUCT YET !!!!!!!"
2,"Received two defective units, gave up","First unit I received had a broken servo drive right out of the box. After several weeks waiting for Pentax to deal with the warranty return, I received a replacement with a defective CIS (two thick black stripes across all scans). Judging from the many positive reviews, my experience must be a fluke... but two defective scanners, both with totally different problems? What are the chances? I definitely won't be touching another Pentax product anytime soon."
4,worth reading,"This book is worth a read, I finished it two weeks ago, and I find myself thinking about it still.Very interesting concept. The second book is more peopled and I liked it better then the firsthalf. It is just different, very different!"
4,Another excellent concept book from the sci-fi master,"I don't think anyone who has read Niven would argue thathe is the master of what I like to call the ""concept""novel. He invents a fantastic concept, throroughlydevelops the idea, then writes a story around it. Theshortcoming of the method is that characters, and inparticular the flow of the stories from beginning to endis compromised. The Integral Trees is no exception tothis rule, though characters are developed marginally betterthan in many Niven novels. The concept is based arounda society of people descended from a single space shipwhich was stranded near a neutron star. The neutron starsustains a unique ecosystem in the ""smoke ring"" ofbreathable gasses in orbit around it. The integral treesare giant trees, shaped like the calculus symbol for anintegral. The people inhabit the trees, and this is wherethe story begins. This novel is a very quick read, andas I mentioned, the concept is fabulous. I recommend it."
5,Me gusto,"La raqueta no la habia probado, pero me acomodo y me gusto, llego sin problemas y en perfecto estado"
5,terrific racquet,the head ti s5 tennis racquet is an amazing product. the grip is very large and extremely comfortable and soft. the racquet face is nice and large providing an easier way to hit the ball. the racquet is made of titanium which makes it extremely light but thick and strong at the same time. I highly reccomend you buy this racquet to fit your needs. i loved this racquet and so will you.
5,Works fine.,No complaints. Works as intended. Stays on belt sander and on track as it is supposed to. Good value for money.
3,Dont need it.....yet.,"I bought this as a extra thing to have with my high lift jack. i havent needed it, yet, but i would imagine it would work if i did. just as a warning though, it is a small hook. from the tip to the arm of the hook the gap is only about 2"" at the most. so it doesnt fit many bumpers, but with a little modification, you can attach a second tow hook to fit almost any application."
2,I'd Give this Game One and a Half Stars If I Could!,"THis was the most offensive, lame, and, well, STUPID game I've ever played!!!! First of all, the swearing, disgusting humor, and inappropriate descriptions get so frequent and annoying it isn't funny! I only played this game up to where you get out of the bathroom of the abandoned house, but from my friend's description of the REST of the game, well, let's just it pitches a perfect no-hitter to those of you like me who have to tolerate inappropriate humor but hate it(there are others like me out there, aren't there?) This game is a total waste of money. Don't wait up for a sequel."
5,Becker is the Best in Christian Music!,"Margaret Becker voice is phenomenal, plus her musical talents are on top. So why isn't Becker one of the top performers in Christian music? Well, she should be. You're missing out on the best. This album Becker pays tribute to her Irish roots and her grandparents as she relates in the title track, 'Immigrant's Daughter.' This album was named one of the top 100 best gospel albums by CCM. She digs deep into her spiritual longing in family traditions. She accomplishes this in the passion of her songs. This can be heard in 'This is My Passion,' 'Hunger Stays,' 'I Commit' and ""People Get Ready.' The music is a mixture of mellow folk rock with some bluesy overtones and a little irishness. Her work carries over into 'Falling Forward' album. Another you can't pass up. This gal can really sing! Just try one of her album and see what you're really missing. It's a wonder why she's not a BIG artist. Maybe that's a blessing in disguise. You won't be disappointed."
2,Nothing compared to Quake.,"For starters this is an ok game....nothing more. The controls and gameplay suck hard compared to Quake and DOOM, the storyline sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM and the multiplayer sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM. So go play Quake or DOOM :)"
3,Not bad,"Pros: keeps your collar stiff, good priceCons: It's metal inside of cloth so eventually I think it will actually damage my shirts collars, the sizes are limited; should have smaller sizes."
5,Marvelous for meditation and relaxation!,"JM Talbot's ""The Quiet"" is wonderful in its simplicity, its beauty and its spiritually uplifting peacefulness. It's one of my favorite choices to play whenever I'm trying to come to a sense of prayerful quiet of my own during a busy day. This all-instrumental collection from Talbot on guitar, accompanied by a small group of string and wind musicians, is strongly recommended!"
2,Confused!!!,"Please don't waste your money. I couldn't figure out where the plot was headed. I got halfway through and got a phone call and never watched the rest of it. It was boring with a capital 'B'. I still never started it over and watched the whole thing after that phone call. I gave it 2 stars: one for having the guts to make this movie, and the other for filming it in Africa."
2,Adequate but...,"This product is adequate but has a couple of significant drawbacks. On the plus side, it keeps the front child dry. On the negative side:1. It doesn't fit well if you have the extra seat attached at the rear and reclined. If reclined, the rear part of the cover tends to ride up over the back of the seat allowing water to run into the rear seat.2. It is difficult to pass items to the child in the front seat, eg. drink, snack. A front access zipper/panel would be a great improvement.3. It is cumbersome to put on which exaggerates the access problem: once on, it's easier to leave on and hence a roll up panel or zipper to access the front child would be a big help.These comments also apply for the double sun cover. As someone who does a lot of walking/shopping with the stroller, I'm about to take the scissors to both my covers to do the mods myself... For a company that has such a great stroller design, I expected more user friendly accessories."
4,Studio session with Buddy Guy and John Lee Hooker,"This album was recorded in the studio in Hamburg, Germany on Oct. 7, 1965. Buddy Guy is on tracks 4-11, sometimes on bass. John Lee Hooker on tracks 8 and 9. Also appearing on this album are Fred McDowell, Roosevelt Sykes, Eddie Boyd and Big Mama Thornton."
4,DePalma's Best Homage to Hitchcock,"When I consider the career of Brian DePalma I am disappointed. Early on many of his films (especially this one) demonstrated great talent and innovation. Now it seems that he has just become another Hollywood hack director for hire.Dressed To Kill is a gem from the past that shouldn't be missed by any fan of A. Hitchcock. I applaud the performance of Michael Caine, the cinematography (especially the opening sequence in the Metropolitan), the moody and atmospheric score, and the restrained direction of DePalma (most of his later films are loaded with the current Hollywood disease - the constant reminders to the audience that scream out ""Yes you ARE watching a movie here! ""). I hope that someone can make a suspense film this good again someday, but it looks like DePalma isn't up to the task."
1,PORNO,"I think this movie was HORRIBLE, and its WAY TOO risque for the 80's and even for now. We were intending to watch a thriller, but got to see naked women in the shower which is very inappropriate for my little eyes. Even our dog was shocked. BAD MOVIE -0 stars in my book and i am a movie critic-Sarah Jessica Waterman"
3,A Suspenceful DePalma at one of his best,"Now this is DePalma at the top of his game. It's a superb suspence thriller copmbining sex, fear, a transsexual killer, and one of the best actress around-Nancy Allen, who is always awesome and I think is underrated as a actress. DePalma move the story along with suspence and kept me guessing at what would happen next. A interesting film combining hitchcockian techniques, it can be seen as something similar but what I love about DePalma is that he takes something and makes it his own. Anyone that hasn't seen the film- see it. And the extras are informative. A great buy for the fans."
2,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * *,"Who would like this? : psycho, crime, thriller, mystery, & slice 'em up fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : no-rent it : maybeCast:Michael CaineAngie DickinsonNancy AllenKeith Gordon__________________Brian De PalmaDirector* ok so I'm little disappointed that wasn't Angie we were looking at in the shower - still a pretty good scene even if it wasn't the first of it's kind."
2,It Won't Make You Forget No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith,"This disc appears to be identical to the King Biscuit Flower Hour disc although in cheaper packaging and at a lower price.The sound quality is mediocre to poor, but this does have the distinction of being one of the few ""legitimate"" live recordings of the Brian Robertson-era Motorhead. Save for this feature, this disc would only get one star.The interview is interesting, but the interviewer seems like a doofus. Lemmy doesn't seem to care for him very much."
2,sandhill moving blanket quality,I purchased 2 sandhill moving blankets. My following comments would cause me not to buy them again:1) Because of backorder it took me almost a month to receive them.2) Multiple colors cause edges to not be sewed.3) After 2 weeks usage one blanket has stitching coming out in 2 places
3,David Cronenberg's Scanners,"The Scanners are a group of beings who have a power that they can bend,twist,mutilate,and explode other human beings,using the powers of their minds. There are two groups of scanners good and bad.One of the scanners Revok wants the scanners to band together for his evil purposes, he spends his time trying to locate his brother, a good scanner, Cameron and finds him for the ultimate showdown between the good and evil scanners. In between all this we get to see a couple heads explode.Not really among Cronenberg's best, but it's ok."
3,Assassinate anyone just by thinking it. The Scanners can.,"A film I have been wanting to see for 22 years. Now on DVD, I can. Imagine having the will power to make someone do anything you want them to do without touching them or physically blocking them. Your mind of ESP or telepathy was so strong they can do exactly what you wanted. They have a seizure, a heart attack, give themselves a shot instead, have a car accident. In this film, these exceptional people are called ""scanners"". Some do this for goodwill. It's just a quiet form of communication. But the character Michael Ironside plays is so powerful with telepathy, he can assassinate at will using only his mind.Followed by:Scanners II: The New Order (1991).Scanners III: The Takeover (1992).Scanner Cop (1994), Scanners: The Showdown (also known as Scanner Cop II: Volkin's Revenge [1994]).Michael Ironside can also be seen inVisiting Hours,V: The Final Battle(1984),V: The Complete Series(1984-85)."
1,"Shame on you, MGM.","My one-star rating is for this DVD, not the film, which is Cronenberg at his brilliant best. I find it utterly contemptible that such an obscenely rich company as MGM would have the gall to release such a shoddy DVD. Simply put, the last reel is out of sync, effectively ruining the crucial final 30 minutes of the film. Don't make the same mistake I did. Avoid this DVD like the plague until a more reputable company gives SCANNERS the proper DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves."
2,Not An Everyday Shoe - Returned after a few months,"While the styling on the Merge shoe is current, the quality is questionable. In the last few years, Kenneth Cole began manufacturing shoes in China. Consequently, the quality quality of materials and construction have degraded.When worn periodically (evenings/weekends), these shoes should last 12 to 18 months. When worn on a daily basis, I doubt they will longer than 6 months. Eventually, the inexpensive leather cracks and the sole wears.However, I just purchased my second pair of these shoes. They are a bit expensive for low quality shoes, but I need the extended size and appreciate the styling.UPDATE: Well, the leather split on these shoes like they did on my first pair. The Kenneth Cole shoes coming from China are garbage in my opinion. Since I paid full retail for these, I sent them back and Amazon customer service worked with me to find a replacement."
1,EXTREMELY uncomfortable,"I love the Kenneth Cole brand, but I had a HORRIBLE experience with these shoes. The shoes were constantly rubbing my feet the wrong way (despite being the proper size) and left my feet extremely uncomfortable. I returned these and got a pair of Kenneth Cole Reaction Shoes, Strong Force Moc Toe Oxfords - these shoes were like walking on a CLOUD...GREAT, comfortable shoe."
5,Seanie at his best!,"Or maybe it is because the subject area is so close to my heart. Condon disproves the myth that the second book you write is the 'difficult' one.We meet Sean and David on the plane from Australia and leave them there at the end. In between we travel through 2 countries and umpteen states with the gagster Sean and quiet, thoughtful David. I loved this book; I loved the fractured writing style and I loved the offbeat overly-descriptive descriptions of whatever caugt Condon's eye."
4,Traveling the Road to El Dorado is a Whole Lotta Fun!,"Until I purchased the DVD version of the Eldorado movie, which contained a demo of this PC game. I didn't even know it existed. Once I tried it, I knew I had to have the full version of the game.The game has enough challenges and humor to keep both kids and adults hooked on it, from beginning to end. In fact, as soon as I finished it, I wanted to play it again!The elements of the movie are all there, as you start your journey trying to figure out how to escape capture from the guards in Spain, finding a way off of Cortez's ship, and of course making your way to the city of El Dorado. There are also cut scenes between the action sequences from the actual movie.This is not a long game, but the fun factor and graphics make up for the shortness of it. If you liked the movie, you will really enjoy this game!"
2,The Road to El Dahhhhh,"This game is half cut scene / half game. The DVD was great, but my 5 year old and I are trying to get through the game with great agony for me. He is plugging away. I'm giving hints via a handy walkthrough I found via google (Thank you MaGtRo).Walk three steps, 2 minutes of dialog over and over. Yikes!"
3,Good but is it necessary?,"I always query these ""how to write..."" books, because everything they tell you is taken for granted by the most mediocre authors. This book is well written and everything in it seems very sensible and sound advice, but wouldn't it be better to be original and devise your own method of plotting, rather than writing to someone elses formula.If you are completely clueless, by all means, this book is worth-your-while, but for the more serious 'authorial' hopefuls try something of your own devising, it will be better in the end."
2,This anthology saves you the time cost of course handouts,"Reprints and introductions. A collection of Singer and Dunn's chosen favorites...no contemporary aesthetics to speak of, a brace of their class handouts and lectures with the modern period curiously under-represented.If you teach this kind of course and want to save yourself the trouble of gathering materials, this is the anthology for you.It is the purpose of this Blackwell series to serve the teaching community in this way. A real text book; a book of texts by various hands."
2,Dont Buy,"This item broke within the first 30 minutes I recieved it. I pulled out the cords to see first how long they were and how it worked and was used. So I pulled both sides out and it pressed the retract button to have the cords go back inside then it got stuck. I somehow mnaged to get them back in but when I used it later and had to pull them out then this time the cords didnt go back in. So now my retract button doesnt work and the cords are hanging out. But other than that the item works fine, Just have to be careful with the cords."
3,OK,It is fun for a couple of hours. But it gets boring after a while. If you like boxing this game is for you. It is a good game to start off with because you learn the controls well while playing this game.
5,Haunted Honeymoon A Hoot!,"I had seen Haunted Honeymoon many years ago when it first came out. I have always been a Dom DeLuise,Gilda Radner and Gene Wilder fan. This movie brought them all together in one FUN movie. Sometimes, an escape from reality is a good thing and Dom DeLouise in drag throughout most of the movie is just that. (He actually looked like a teacher I had in elementary school) Don't expect a deep message, there isn't one in this movie. It's just fun to watch."
3,Not an excat match,This is more a Tiffany Green than a Tiffany Blue. Doesn't match the rest of my Tiffany Blue bridesmaid dresses for our wedding so can't use them. Nice quality ties though.
2,"nice quality paper, not excited about the fortunes","This book is printed on very nice, high quality paper. The designs are fun and eye-catching.However, I was really disappointed with the ""fortunes"".... a lot of boy/girl stuff and for other items I thought the overall tone was flippant, kind of ""in your face"".I have fond memories of making cootie catchers at Girls Scout Camp many years ago, so I was excited to introduce my kids to them. But I didn't think the overall theme here is appropriate for a seven and nine year old. It is very ""worldly"" for lack of a better term.There are several blank pages at the back, so you can create your own themes, so that is one redeeming thing. I love Klutz products, but I just don't want my young kids thinking about and ""playing"" with a lot of boyfriend/girlfriend themed material. I'm passing this one on."
5,The only belts I buy,"The purple belt from 3m is the only belts I will buy for use on my portable belt sander. I have been a cabinetmaker for over 20 years, and I find that these are the strongest, longest lasting belts on the market. Beleive me, I have tried many brands over the years and they all have fallen short compared to these belts. You will burn these belts before they break; and you will have to work at making them burn."
2,Doesn't take kindly to Kindle version,"It's not a field guide. If the sample function had worked, I would have realised that the illustrations were small, and black-and-white, despite the color cover. Since I can't zoom the images on my iPod Touch, it's like viewing a postage stamp. The detailed illustrations are useless. It's also for sportfish mainly, not reef fish. No key or arrangement other than alphabetical, so you need to slog through every entry until you see one that looks like what you have (in black-and-white).Wish I could return it."
2,Not much new for LMTs,"I am an LMT in CT & was disappointed when this book arrived. Out of 236 pages there is only 20 pages of massage techniques (one to two on each page). Many of these were taucht in school (not much new). Most of the book went into Anatomy and Physiology (skin, hair, skeleton, muscles, blood circ, lymph, nervous, olfactory, respiratory). I thought this book was about Indian Head massage not Anatomy/Physiology. If you are not an LMT & are looking for a well rounded book about Anatomy & pathologies(100pg), consultations (15pgs), chakras (15pgs), workplace ergonomics(10pgs), and a little bit of massage, then this book is for you."
2,socks,"They are over the calf, at least for the first 10 min. Fabric is very thin and cheap. I'm figuring these socks will last 6 months. If you bleach your whites, possibly only 3 months."
2,Did not wear well,"I bought a package of these tube socks for my husband within the past couple months and they've already worn holes in the heels. I've bought this same type and brand of socks before and they've usually lasted a year or more, but these have started wearing holes in them within a couple weeks. It's like the knitting comes undone and forms holes in the stress points. Usually you have to wear through them. Anyway, I'm not pleased with them and very hesitant to try even buying them locally now. Very disappointing."
5,A vanishing breed........,I love over the calf socks but I have been unable to find them locally. Great socks! My thanks to Hane's and Amazon.
1,indigo prophesy,"I really wish that I could give this game a good rating but when it arrived I tried to load it and it would not load in my computer.Of course I have a C**py Dell and they dident put in the 32MG card I need to run this game. And Who knows just how much it will be to get one,HA HAMost likely a new computer though I just bought this one in Nov,08.AS Far as rating the Seller, it arrived fast and in great condition.To the people who did not like how I rated this game, It is hard to give a good rating to a game that I could not play. I did saythat it was my computer not the game itself.So if you like this kind of game buy it! I wish like heck it that I could have played it."
1,Indigo Prophecy,This was one of the worst games I ever played as I could not use my mouse and I didn't have anything else to use.
4,"great fun overall, left me longing for more","This was a great game! So what if it was copied from some movies? I had fun and that's what matters. The controls were a little hard to get by but redefining the Num 1,2,3,5 to match the arrows keys did the job for me. The cinematics though nothing new were still awesome because you could feel the hard work that went into making it. Overall I would recommend playing it because its a great game for killing a whole day."
1,elvis! a documentary,"This is the worst product that I have ever seen, very, very poor quality, this looks like someone taped from another poor quality tape then reproduced it, I would like very much to return for full refund. Amazon should look at what they are selling. This item dosen't even rate a one star."
5,Opened My Eyes,"Another view that many handicappers, make that most handicappers don't fully utilize. Barry Meadows spells it out, and shows the bettor how to get the most money for their money wagered. I have noticed a better return on my winnings since I have read the book."
5,20-year listener,"I have nothing but good things to say about this album. My mom first bought it on cassette tape before I was born over 20 years ago and it played in my nursery as a baby. The original tape even had a part where she'd accidentally hit ""RECORD"" while trying to turn on the tape player and taped over the song with a few seconds of me (as an infant) crying. I listened to the tape incessantly as a little girl and, upon upgrading to a new boom box for my room several years ago, got this CD as a birthday present. I'm now 20 years old and a (well adjusted, I promise! haha) sophomore in college and I still listen to this CD every night while at home and even at school when I'm having trouble sleeping. It's an incredibly peaceful, calming and beautiful collective and I cannot WAIT to play it for my children some day."
3,damaged case,"I appreciated the good price of this item, but I was disappointed that it was not packaged better. The cd case had a long crack in it; and I had bought it as a gift."
3,Arena Football meets NBA JAM,"If you like Arena Football and love fast paced, thumb twitching, sweaty palm action then this game is for you. If you're looking for REAL football go for NFL 2K1. THE GOOD NEWS. This is really a game about scoring massive amounts of points, pounding the crud out of NFL players that you hate in real life, and having ARCADE fun. The tackles are right out of the WWE, the game speed is that of NBA JAM, and the thrill of winning is surpassed by none. THE BAD NEWS. The big hits get boring, you get used to the game speed as you keep playing, and winning flat out becomes way too easy. All in all, this game was fun for awhile (it lasted longer than some games), and the more I played it the less I said WOW! LOOK AT THAT! The only real replay value comes from inviting your friends to partake in the slugfest and then talking crap as the feel of the bone-breaking hits make you say WOW! again."
4,It keeps you going,This game has great graphics. It has about 4 different football stadiums to play in but it can also be challenging. You'll never truly dominate the computer. It always comes back for more. It kind of get's boring playing it by yourself.
3,"Excellent Sim, very real but difficult to learn.","I found Israeli Air Force to be an incredible simulation game. However some of the training scenarios were difficult to follow especially in the critical air to ground training. Many missions are hard to perform since the sim seems to easily kill your wingmen and assisting sections. All in all worth the money, especially if you want to engage foreign fighters such as the awesome Mig-29 and the lightning fast Mig-25."
4,big bouncy curls,"bought this iron to create volume and big waves. so far i love it! also like that since i have fine hair this iron isnt as damaging as the original.my hair looks gorgeous when i use this.dont recommend for ppl with shorter hair as i think the barrel is too large to make an actual curl. if you dont know how to use a marcel iron,its really not hard and u get used to it. try it! you can always return"
1,Poppycock!,"This book starts out rationally enough, but soon deteriorates into some annoying quasi-scientific posturing. Psychoanalysis is compelling and convincing without the 'data' - much of it questionable - Vaughan cites. The wonder, the mystery, and the beauty of her topic are subsumed by her gimmicky neurobiological slant. Many of her theories are unprovable. The specious science is a little scary - she's a psychiatrist, and ought to know better."
3,Bratty Heroine,There were times when I truly wanted to strangle the hero. She was so spoiled and was ALWAYS getting everybody in trouble!
4,Great food for small - medium crickets,I've been buying this product for 3 years and have consistently had good results with my small to medium sized crickets. I order 1000 at a time and usually only have 100 or so die but usually that is in the first day after I get them shipped in so I think it is travel shock. Recently I ran out of the cubes before I could get more and found a homemade solution online of mixing dry catfood with powdered milk. Now my crickets like that better than the cubes and will horde the catfood while the cubes dry up. So - lesson is don't use this with other foods or they may choose the other first. This stuff is super convenient and will keep them hydraded as well as fed (unlike catfood/milk). I like the idea someone else put of sticking them in a plastic milk lid of water to keep the cubes hydraded longer without drowning the crickets. My western painted turtle and gecko love the crickets that eat the cubes too.
2,A Loser,"What a disappointment. The actors went through the motions. I didn't care what happened by the end except that the movie be over. The ending was the best part of the film, though. It was unexpected. I did not find this film suspenseful. I was bored by it."
3,I contradicted Candyman,"In the origional story, Candyman's ashes were scattered on Cabrini Green. How did they get their if he was killed in New Orleans. The movie wasn't bad, the acting was good (all except the man who plays Annie's brother). Good to rent, but the first is so much better."
1,"Do not purchase, rent or see this movie","Compared to the original and Barker's masterpiece which once again blurs the thin line between pleasure and pain this movie is a complete let down. The sub plots and annoying disc jockey mesh to form what one might call an extremely annoying and trite horror experience. The plot is predictable and obviously if your considering purchasing this film you have not seen it. Trust me, Clive Barker's other films Hellraiser I, II and IV are where you should be browsing."
2,Sequel,"I thougth that this film would of been better but it wasn't. It was a corney, chessey, and cheap sequel. The film had no value in special effects and meaning, and it wasn't as close to be good as the cult classic orignal. I only gave it two stars because it had the same music, and themes, as the orignal, and that it had characters and pictures from the orignal."
4,Great Getting-Started Book,"This children's book is aimed at young kids learning to read. It has large type that doesn't overrun the pictures, so young eyes can focus clearly on the words. Simple vocabulary and a fun topic (eaking cake at a birthday party!) makes this a fun book for a preschooler's library."
3,The games are excellent but...,"I have had problems with not only the Ultima 7's but EXODUS and Ultima 2 as well. They barely work on my computer and are a mess to start or deal with so I don't play them. As for 7 and serpent Isle, these were very good games even graphic wise but now that my old SBPro card has been damaged I can't play them despite the fact that I have a SBLive. I warn you, there are NO cards that use ISA slots(required for these games) You can't buy them, you can't special order them, and half the ""tech-heads"" I talk to don't even know what they are! You'd better have a good ISA card if you want to buy this product. Or Roland Daughterboard which cannot be purchased anywhere these days."
1,Don't buy this,"It's pretty simple, here. Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7. So you want three games if want old-school Ultima: Ultima 7, Ultima 7 Serpents Isle, and Ultima 8. The rest of the titles are just garbage, and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable. Is anybody really buying this? And will your PC even play the older titles? And would you even want it to? They're bad. I mean, really, really, bad.This is a nostalgia purchase, nothing more. It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming, but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play; Ultima 8? A little less so, mostly because it is smaller in scope. This is where the Baldur's Gate Series began, which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games, so there is an historical component. Still, it's just not worth this price. I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again (maybe). Yeah, maybe."
1,This has nothing to do with a Review,I know that the Ultima games are awesome but I can't play any of them.This title has been on backorder since early January. Don't waste your time ordering. I will get my software the day after never..!!
2,not for serious reptiles,"Don't use Zilla lights for any reptile that really needs proper UVB, like bearded dragons. Spend the extra money and get a ReptiSun bulb and a good fixture. If your animal just needs a little UVB then this can work, when the ballast wants to fire..."
3,Evil play in an Evil time.,"Using the Satanic occult in an attempt to bring down Hitler in WWII?It's always fun when an author uses alternative means as to the fall of Nazi Germany or a parallel dimension to it's surival.Here Dennis Wheatley uses one of the more famous events to portray his story. The fall of Hitler and the reason behind it, duping Hitler to believe that he will be ressurected as a superbeing that would rule the world. As if he wasn't trying to already.A little dark for those with a weak stomach but you soon get use to it."
3,"Decent overview, poor organization","It has the information for basic controls, but the organization is tough for beginners to follow. It is just tough to read through, and I am one who reads many EE and math books cover to cover."
4,Very useful as both an introduction and a reference text,"Control systems are a difficult subject to cover, but this book does a good job of bringing the novice reader up to speed. This is a very straightforward treatment of an extremely technical field, and while it could hardly be described as gripping reading, Phillips has done a good job of presenting the main concepts clearly and understandably. The book is nicely divided into self-contained sections, allowing undergraduate students to immediately identify those topics relevant to their course. Probably the most useful textbook available to the undergraduate control student."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"I was totally blown away by this album. Pete Bender expresses his Native American heritage in a way that makes you feel what it is like to be an Indian. In a way I found this album a political expression of the sadness felt by the American Indian (over the loss of their land) that is still with them today. That sadness resonates throughout this album, it touches your soul in a such a way, that it makes you feel what it must have been like long, long ago during the Trail of Tears, The Long Walk; the tremendous emotional pain of that era is so evident yet beautifully expressed and deeply felt by the listener."
2,Bomb!!!!,"Unfortunately, I bought this album expecting it to be more like it's predecessor ""Wakin up the neighbors"", without even hearing anything off of it. My mistake! This album is Bryan's attempt to be hip to the alternative crowd. Be yourself Bryan! Half of the songs on this album are okay, and that's the problem! I would recommend, buy it, but don't expect too much!! If you wan't an excellent Bryan Adams album, buy Wakin' up the neighbors!!!!!"
3,Good one but..,"[Good songs: 1. Only thing that looks good on me. 2. Lets make a night to remember 3. Star 4. Have you ever really loved a woman ? ] [Cheeky songs: Of course, ""Underwear"".. ] [Lousy: The rest]. The good songs stand out because of outstanding lyrics and good music. The bad stick out like a sore thumb because they don't seem to mesh with the scheme of things in this album. They look like they belong someplace else. Now, we come to the cheeky one.. I, frankly, liked the song. It is unlike BA to sing songs like these.. so came as bit of a surprise.. a pleasant one at that..:-)"
4,You know what to expect from Bryan,"After ""Waking up the neighbours"" he put a new border for 5 stars, so this one deserves 4. A half of album is 4 to 5 stars, the rest is 2 or 3 stars. If you are fan or like to listen BA's R&R, this is for you. Else.... buy ""Waking..."" or at least ""So far..."" if this is gonna be only BA album in your collection."
1,I Know B.A. Fans Will Be Upset With Me...,"...But I don't care much for this album at all. I like the albums, ""On A Day Like Today"", ""Waking Up The Neighbours"" and love ""Reckless"", but ""18 Til I Die"" is a mess. The first track, ""The Only Thing That Looks Good..."" and ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman"" are good songs, but that's it. These two songs book-end an album of incoherent lyrics, strange teenage boy-like fantasies, and pop-rock melodies which have no hooks to them. I really do feel like this album was made by a group of teenage kids in a garage band. It feels like a step backwards for Bryan. We're talking 1970's. Even the romantic ballads feel contrived and un-romatic this time around. Strange and disappointing album from a great pop-rocker."
4,For the price it's just right,"I now owned this wind up clock for about a month. It has two wind up toggles on back, one for the clock and one for the alarm. Your fingers get jammed in between the back knobs for one of them when winding. It keeps pretty accurate time but you MUST wind ""EVERY"" night. The alarm is first class and ""WILL"" startle you easily awake with how loud it is. It feels cheap at first touch with the back plate feeling like it can just come off, but for the price it does the job. This is great for when you have those power outages and your clock radio is now out of wack and you still have this baby to back you up."
4,Nice looking alarm,Purchased for my daughter - it is too loud with a very little possibility to adjust. Not rigid enough as well. Negligently (while still in the dreams) dropped from the nightstand and broken. It is needed to be handled careful... or handled when you completely woke up ;)
2,Goddess Workout with Dolphina: Introduction to Bellydance Fi,"This DVD is good for people that are more interested in learning how to bellydance. Dolphina demonstrated the basic moves but because she is wearing bellydancing garb it is difficult to see the mechanics of her movement. I wanted a workout not a bellydancing lesson. There are more shots of her face than her body movements. After 10 minutes I was still doing the workout but I was beginning to get bored! Overall, I think this DVD is better suited for entertainment purposes. There are better bellydance workout/fitness DVDs out there."
2,Disapointing,"I was excited at first. I started feeling the burn with the arm moves. Beautiful scenery & costumes. I quickly got fustrated trying to follow what she was doing for hip, leg & footing- kinda hard when the camera only likes her upper body. She would be in the middle of a move & the camera would zone in on her chest, face, move on her smile- she would be done with the move & onto another one. I kept rewinding with no futher luck.My opinion is that if your able to see her whole body doing the moves, it would be great for a beginner. I'm not wasting my money on her other videos!"
1,Dont' bother,"This video is too concentrated on the instructor so basically, all camera angles are center towards her face. While she's trying to teach the hip movements, the camera is preoccupied on her face so you don't really know how you hip is suppose to go. This is an awful instructional video. Dont' bother paying for this."
3,Fun but has some flaws,"Overall, I did enjoy this DVD. It's fun and not that difficult of a workout. I've taken one class before so I'm familar with most of the moves. This helps to compensate for shortcomings in the video.Like many other posters pointed out, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired. When Dolphina's doing lower body work, the camera is often focused on her face which is very unhelpful. Another frustrating aspect is that she spends a lot of time of simpler moves (i.e., shimmy and head circles) but rushes through much harder moves (i.e., undulations and snakes). This video would also be better if she spent more time on the routine - maybe go through it once slowly and then up to rhythm.To end on a positive note, the scenery and costumes are lovely. She is a good teacher and has a very calming demeanor. I would recommend this DVD to someone who has taken a class before but not to a total novice."
4,Head Ti-S6 Tennis Racquet,"I used this racquet, for the first time, today. Not bad. Very light weight and easy to handle."
1,"Its so stupid, its almost scary","I saw this movie about 2 months ago, and I have to say its the worst movie I have ever sceen!!!. There have been better, The Place That Time Forgot and The Lost World (the original one) are great exmaples. The effects were terrible and the acting was sluggish and slipshod at times. I never stopped laughing at the effects of this movie. I may be only 17 but I know the classics I like, and this one is not a classic, it was a waste of of time and money."
5,Underbar Ber√§ttarkonst!,"Herman Lindqvist, Sweden's favourite narrator, has done it again, bringing us Swedish history through his popular narrative style. Lindqvist brings Axel von Fersen to life in this personal and intimate true tale of one of the most colourful people in Swedish history. If you like ""Hermans historia"" you'll love this book. The book is in Swedish so ""du fr l√§ra dig sprket."""
4,Gurcharan Randawa aka. George,"If anyone knows G. Randawa who is a big fan of Rush, please let me know. He is from England. We went together to see a Rush concert in Denver's Mc Nicols Sports Arena (RIP) back in 1986, what a blast, Rush is still one of the best bands, I am sure this DVD is worth it although I was a little bit Disappointed from the sound of Rush in Rio."
5,Much better than the Snakes & Arrows Blu-ray...,"... because, unlike the Snakes & Arrows Blu-ray, the video and audio on the R30 Blu-ray are perfectly in-sync. The setlist is better too, IMO. R30 is probably my favorite Blu-ray right now, and is a must have for Rush fans, especially since it includes the entire concert (the previously released DVD is shortened by several songs... see other reviews below)."
5,Yes! RUSH!,"A fantastic DVD of Rush in concert. I played it at a friends house and everyone was standing and dancing and cheering the whole show. It was as if Rush had stopped by to play. Incredible show, excellent sound and fantastic footage!"
2,"Nice to look at,, horrible sound","I am a rabid, avid Rush fan but folks, give me a break: while it's really nice to look at and the video editing impressive, the sound quality (on audio CD)and musicianship of this concert was surprising disappointing to me.Too bad.I wish they'd hurry up and release the remaster of Vapor Trails already.~G~"
3,Somebody answer me?,Disregard my rating.I have Rush in Rio on dvd and cd.Had A show of Hands. I have different Stages and every other Live Rush cd going back to All the worlds a stage. Is there anymore reason to buy another Live Rush release? Is the old material from the 70's worth it? Someone respond I would appreciate it.
5,this is THE rush concert dvd to own,"RUSH30 is the dvd that rush in rio wishes it was. that previous release was ruined (in my opinion) by the nonstop singing,chanting,and screaming of the brazillian audience. RUSH30 was filmed in Germany, where apparently they have seen live music before and act accordingly, you can actually HEAR the music and the audience cheers between songs, just like it should be.the audio and visual quality on this dvd are excellent, aq top notch concert film."
3,Uninspired crowd also included!!,"Being a long-time Rush fan, I understand why its so much fun to see this band - the crowd and band feed off one another and you can feel the energy in the air. But due to a lack-luster crowd, 'R30' fails to capture the magic that I've experienced at every Rush concert including the many times that I have watched the 'Rush in Rio' DVD. At times the lads almost seem to give up on trying to get the crowd into the moment. Neil and Alex also seemed frustrated with the vibe, but Geddy really tried to carry them through and stayed enthusiastic. Even though the production value of 'R30' is far superior to 'Rush in Rio' and the coveted track ""Between The Wheels"" is finally available, I would much rather watch 'Rush in Rio' any day. Would I still buy R30? Of course! :)"
3,Missing Cd's,"Can't really comment on DVD, since I havn't watched it yet. Just received my second DVD and it's missing the cd's also. I'm sending this one back also. I would like to get what I paid for. Do I keep sending them back till I get one with the cd's? Wish somebody at Amazon would sort this out with the supplier."
4,A Must Have,"This is definately the edition to purchase. Make sure it says deluxe edition. The other world tour is that of 2 videos. It is worth the little extra to get that plus the 2 music cd's. You will also get an extra little bonus in the deluxe edition. It sounds great. It is a joy to watch. Great performances. If you like Rush music, you will love this"
4,Great concert!,"Excellent audio quality!, excellent video quality!, excellent show!!! More than 2 hours of excellent music full of excelllent memories!I can't give 5 stars to this show 'cause I expected more classic songs from this band that are not present in this BD, but at the end of the history...only 2 words: buy it!"
2,too much back ground synthesizer ruins it,"it is a shame such talent wasted on reptitious background sythesier that drowns out the talent, it is very repitious and irritating, just play the vilion and forget the other insturments"
5,The Roar of Love: A Musical Journey Into the Wonder of C.S. Lewis' Narnia,"I enjoyed this album immensely when it first came out in the 80's. Now after seeing the movie in the theatre, I purchased it again as I found it has been remastered and put on CD. I LOVE IT. THE SONGS ARE PHENOM! Service from Amazon was great too! Thanks. It was worth every penny. Linda"
3,Picture Quality Comment,"Many dvds these days are digitally remastered, so that picture quality is clean, sharp, pristine. This isn't one of them. The pictuire quality here israther poor. Unusual as many other Midnight Movie prints are excellent.Plus the ratio is NOT 1.66 as stated on the box. It is 14x9, with black borders; or, with x zoom to fill the screen, the picture is softened and some picture is lost."
1,Do not order from this company!,I reached out to them telling them the DVD does not work - and I never heard back from them. It is not formatted for this region. When I changed the region on my computer - the DVD still did not work.
1,WOW,this movie wasnt the movie i was lookign for first and for most. I didnt really watch it have it on FF the whole time
1,"Oh God no, the pain.",">> Spoilers <<but you REALLY shouldn't watch this anyway. Legit.This was quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen. It was hilariously terrible. I am NOT using that lightly. TERRIBLE. We literally had to stop the movie to recoup, then finish it. The Terribly awkward shaped 80's boobs, the fact that the plot was vague at best, and the God awful acting made the movie watchable. That every woman in the ENTIRE movie (except for 2, I swear) is raped by (aliens? perhaps) and murdered. Level of nakedness: high. Number of naked people you would ever want to see naked: Zero.Seriously, AWFUL.Do yourself a favor, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's just not worth the pain."
1,Why did I even bother,"I should of known better after picking up and reading the back. It just screamed cheesyness and poor production values. Yet I went ahead and viewed it anyways and here is the result.This movie is Garbage.THe idea behind breeders is that these giant fly like creatures are in New York City on the sole purpose of impreginating Human Female Virgins. In the course of the movie with the exception of the first victim all of them get naked before the creatures arrive, in fact on is doing stretching exercises in the nude before the creature shows up. What were they expecting these things or do all female virgins roam around the house, work, general vacinity in the nude when no one is around. Any way a police detective and Doctor decide to investigate and in the end they find the girls again swimming around naked in lotion. Overall there are a lot of naked women to a bad 80's sci fi movie. This should not be viewed by anyone."
1,Let's hope it never BREEDS more,"Good lord... who ever thought of making this movie? Talk about boring and just plain bad. I'm a huge fan of no-budget ""b"", or even ""z"" movies, but there's just no excuse for this tripe. The acting has to be some of the worst EVER, especially Teresa Farley - yikes!There's absolutely no emotion from these people. And the monster... you get such a quick glimpse of it at the very end you can only tell it's a man in a bad rubber suit, which looks more like a halloween mask and a garbage bag. The rest of the movie is just no-reason-for-them-to-be naked girls screaming at the shadow of the monster. Save your money and get a shot-on-video movie with some attempt at creativity instead."
1,What is this?!,"This movie ranks as one of the worst ""sci-fi"" movies I've ever seen. It truely had no point to it. The plot has been done way too many times. The acting is so bad I found myself laughing at the majority of it.Anyway, so aliens come down to earth and begin to impregnate young women.This movie is horrid beyond all human words. To add to the horrendous acting is embarssing directing and an extremely laughable script.Your money will be happier in your pocket than spent on this rubbish."
2,Hallmark 4 pack,I don't know how Hallmark 4 Pack came to me for review as I don't own it and have never ordered it
5,Hallmark 4 Pack,"This Hallmark 4 Pack is such a great value and it is so nice to watch movies that are family friendly. I particularly enjoyed Bridal Fever- it is a fun story but the others good too. I love watching ""The Good Witch"" during the fall. Well done, Hallmark and Amazon!!!"
2,Okay,"Wayyyy over priced! Should have just used a cloth diaper tucked in. Material is kinda rough. Small and skimpy. But does do the job. Wouldn't purchase again. Two does come in a pack, but for $16 it should be 6!"
4,Good idea,"Any baby will spit up, or just drool, while you are out walking, so this will help save your carrier somewhat. Honestly though, any burp rag/towel would fit this purpose in a pinch. The nice thing about this is it is attached, so won't fall off - but you can 'attach' a towel etc. yourself and save the money. Convenient, but might not be worth the price. That being said, we use it, so I'm glad we have it."
1,Glad I don't have to paddle with this guy...,"You have to give the guy credit for trying, but he seems to miss the whole point of outdoor adventure through his self-serving and misdirected outings. It's like a train wreck, though, and you just have to keep on reading it to see how bad the author is going to get messed up on his next ""expedition"". The editorial ""praise"" is understandably vague, since the only thing the author does worse than ""adventureing"" is writing about it. We have all met people in our own lives that ""just don't get it"", right? Well Genereaux is, unfortunately, that guy."
1,Piece of junk,Normally I wouldn't say something like this about an SMC product but the thing couldn't even reach 10 feet direct line of sight from the wireless router. On top of this we were using a very powerfull router so it shouldn't have had a problem within a hundred and fifty feet. The only way we could get it to work was wired and that defeats the purpose of a wireless print server very poor work on SMC's part and this really surprises me because everything else we've gotten from them was excellent...
2,"Simple to use, but sounds terrible","I installed the video convertor on a laptop running Windows XP. I had no trouble with installation, although I did have a lousy time trying to get the product registered at the link provided during installation.It took some poking around to figure out how to create the video files I wanted. The software is actually pretty easy to use.I never could get the sound I liked. The signal was significantly degraded coming from my audio equipment, compared with recording directly to DVD or sending the signal to my TV."
5,Attn: History Buffs,"I bought this because I knew it was one of my husbands favorite TV shows way back when. We took it on our family vacation (no cable tv) and watched it in the evenings as a family. My girls (ages 13 & 14) enjoyed it as much as we did. I wish there were more shows like this. When we got through the last disc, both my girls said ""Bats Breath""."
3,"It's OK, but not worth purchasing","You know how when you're talking with your friends and someone says something like, ""Hey remember Mushmouth from Fat Albert?"" And you say, ""Yeah, that show was cool. Remember H.R. Puffinstuff or Sigmund and the Sea Monsters?"" And your friends say, ""Yeah, that was cool"". But then you catch an episode of Sigmund and the Seamonsters and realize that it was cool when you were seven, and only because they only other thing on at the time were repeats of Bugs Bunny and Road Runner. I'm not dissing Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner, I'm just saying that you'd seen them a hundred times before, so Sigmund was different. Not better, just different.Then you are up late one night and Nickelodeon shows a repeat of Sigmund and the Sea Monsters and you think to yourself, ""Wow. Did I really use to watch this? This is awful.""Well, Voyagers isn't awful, but it's not as good as your twelve-year-old brain is telling you it is."
5,GOOD FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,THIS SHOW WAS MY SON'S FAVORITE AS A CHILD. IT JUST WENT AWAY AND WE DID'T KNOW WHY BEFORE COMPUTERS MADE INFO SO EASY! NOW I FOUND IT AGAIN AND IT'S 1 OF MY GRANDSON'S FAVORITES TOO! GREAT TO GET THAT IMAGINATION GOING!*
5,Great Value,"I have been using Mirka sanding discs for years. Quality is always good, dispenser box is convienent, Just a great product"
4,Sanding Discs,Mirka 120 grit no-hole adhesive really came in handy for my shelf and mirror project. Price was comparable to stores but became a mess keeping the tape from getting twisted in-between discs. TKS.
5,Great Toons,My grand kids love this. The always look forward to seeing the new episodes. They laugh out load. So cute.
5,Good Delivery,"My husband and I both use this product. None other is as good as Depends, and it is so convenient to order them from Amazon. Delivery is prompt and well done."
2,big pants,"I had thought these would be similar in fit with the pull on pants but with tabs. How wrong was I. I am a small size and can't get these to fit properly, they are huge. The tabs come undone also(when they re pulled tight. I am sorry I bought a case, what a waste of money."
3,Short and sweet.,"1. Good customized fitting for those who use the tabs.2. They hold about 2 good wettings. After that, the leaks come.3. Not my preferred diaper, but they work when my regulars haven't shipped yet.4. They still sag, but not as badly as the regular pull ups.5. Slight crinkly sound and a bit bulgy but not noticeable enough for people to know you're wearing a diaper."
4,Good product,"I used to buy these at BJs Wholesaler but don't see them or at least in small/medium size anymore. I'd just re-ordered using the subscription service for first time. Quick delivery. Pretty convenient and discount is a nice perk although it was a bit confusing re-ordering for the first time. My order was duped in the shopping cart with higher price after I was already charged. It may have been that I was supposed to order it separately from other non-subscription products.I had similar problem as a previous review about some of the adhesive tabs on the undergarments being defective. The tabs were stuck to undergarment when unfolding to use and required fumbling with. I had a few where the tabs came unglued and fell off. I also had to somewhat carefully rip open to separate opening for feet to go through. Overall, good product and best price I found so far. I will continue service for now."
5,The Vecro style tabs help when changing a bedridden person.,"The Vecro style tabs help when changing a bedridden person. Because the side tabs are soft hook and loop, not glue, there is no glue to stick to and damage an elderly person's fragile skin."
1,Depend adjustable underwear,"I was not impressed with this item. Every time my son wears them he gets leaks.They are a convenient method, if they were a bit thicker and had a better leak barrier. I would not order them again."
4,great job,"Thanx for delivering the case in such a timely manner, glad to be able to depend on it getting there."
4,Really Like this Product,"I rated four stars, ""I Like It"", because the fifth star indicates ""I Love It"". I ""really like"" the product, but I save ""my love"" for my husband. Choose another title, and I will rate it five stars."
5,Works well,"The quality of our copies is very good, would buy from this buyer again. I give this product an A. Thank you"
1,Angst to the Nth,"I recorded this off of free cable, watched it, and having grown tired of all the angst by the end of the movie I broke the DVD-R into bits so I would never make the mistake of watching it again."
1,If you want to watch it don't!!,One star is too much for this movie. The plot was too confusing. The acting was horrible. Ivy whined thoroughout the whole movie. Hopkins' role was too confusing. The whole movie dragged.
3,things of soul also fails in cinema,"I don't think this is an terrific film as commonly catalogued. It's a fable about reincarnation as believed in Hindu religion and not so badly conceived although contains a basic failure. Audrey Rose, a little girl eleven years old has disturbing nightmares that worsen progressively. Furthermore his parents are alarmed because a man are watching her. The explanation is this man had years ago a daughter killed in a car accident and he believes Audrey Rose is truly a undue premature reincarnation of her daughter and these is the origin of the strange crises Audrey suffers. Audrey isn't posessed by any devil, simply she expects a better life. Well I find one uses to think things from beyond the grave can't have these defects more own of carnal, human incapacity."
3,still don't know what to make of it,"I had vague memories of this movie from when I was little, and remember being fascinated by it. So I was dying to get my hands on it as an adult, and reaquaint myself with the story. Well, naturally I was disappointed ... I can see how a little kid would be riveted to it, while an adult would be more critical. The family, in all their closeness, was hard to stomach. Ivy was indeed irritating, as others have proclaimed. (Anthony Hopkins was as great as always.) But it was the ending that let me down the most; it was so anticlimactic. I walked away from the whole thing with a bewildered, unsettled feeling."
4,"Review of ""Audrey Rose""","A suspenseful movie set in the 1970's, good acting. The story was believable. It took a little long for the father to really believe in re-incarnation, especially when it involved his beloved daughter. Anthony Hopkins gave a wonderful performance as always."
2,Not leather,"This is a very attractive shoe, but note that, contrary to the product description, as I write this review, the shoe upper is not leather as stated but ""100% synthetic"". I do not think this will last as well as leather, so I do not believe this is good value for the price.You will note that I am an Amazon verified purchaser, so any coxcomb who disputes my experience without purchasing the shoe should be treated with the contempt they deserve."
5,best that's ever been,"This music brought me to tears and laughter w/in the space of a few minutes,such is the power of this man's music-may God Bless him..."
1,how did this average out to 4 stars?,"I agree with the readers who said this book is poorly edited, poorly written, and poorly organized. Tries soap opera ploys to get you to keep reading and is not worth it in the end. Waste of time, the only reason I finished it was I was sick at home."
1,only bad purchase from amazon,"This is something my husband has asked for because of his outside job always made his coffee get cold to quick. It looked really nice and definitely kept his coffee hot, but then coffee would taste like the inner plastic liner after the first 5-10 minutes of being plugged in. Then after 2 weeks of use the charger port became loose and it would no longer work. It wasn't worth my time and money to ship back for a replacement....I just won't buy from that company again.."
5,Great quality,"Perfect for my application, needed to install on my BBQ feed off my deck to have another feed for my generator. Worked out perfect just as planned."
4,A powerful performance by Karajan and Anne Sophie Mutter,"Karajan and Mutter give a very impressive performance of the 4 seasons, it is both pleasurable and entertaining, a highly recommended concert and Mutter is both precise and highly energetic!"
3,"Excellent performance, poor video",I have heard many fine four seasons and this one does not stand out. I still think the performance with Gerald Scwartz on the Delos label with the Seattle Symphony is more lush with better sound. The reason to get this on DVD is to actually see the performance. Yes we do get to see it.....but not very well. The video is quite poor which is perplexing since it is only 20 years ago. The other problem is the concert is only 45 minutes long which is chintzy. I think the standard for DVD concerts should be at least 90 minutes. Redemptively it is going for about $6 on Amazon. Looking forward to a Blu-ray version in DTS HD.
1,Ugh.,"As an adoptive Mother who DID breastfeed, this book just plain annoys me. I both breastfed, (the author of this book states this is not possible), and I bottlefed expressed milk.Studies show that women who formula feed are generally of lower education than those who breastfeed. The way this book is written serves to confirm that."
1,A disservice to ALL mothers!,"Can we give a NO star rating? I am a breastfeeding mom, but I do not consider formula to be 'poison' and I do respect every mother's right to make her own feeding choices for her child without feeling guilty about them. (My older son was both breast and bottle fed.) This book however does NOT focus on bottlefeeding without guilt, but rather it focuses on discrediting breastfeeding and mud-slinging towards breastfeeding mothers. The author seems to have a HUGE chip on her shoulder against all breastfeeding mothers and uses the topic of bottlefeeding as her own personal vindetta against breastfeeding. If someone chooses to formula feed, I do hope that it will be an informed decision because of their own personal feelings and not because of the misinformation that this author chooses to perpetuate."
3,Bottle Feeding Without Guilt,"I ordered this book when my baby was 3 weeks old and I was crying constantly from severe pain as well as emotional distress at the thought of having to quit breastfeeding. I was seeing a lactation consultant but continued to have multiple problems. This was all very difficult especially after breastfeeding my first child easily. My baby is now 11 weeks old and I am continueing to breastfeed thanks, in part, to advice given in this book on how to treat sore nipples. I found this book very reassuring and supportive. Our problems with breastfeeding continue on much smaller scale but I now have peace about the fact I MIGHT have to quit nursing. I did find that the book spent too much time dealing with breast feeding militants who truely are a minority. After speaking with a few bottle feeding moms I have not found any who have had to deal with these fanantics."
1,A thinly veiled attack on breastfeeding advocates.,"Bottlefeeding Without Guilt was of special interest to mebecause I have one child (adopted) who was bottlefed, and two I havebreastfed. I picked this book up expecting support and encouragement, and that is there . . . but it is so surrounded by negative comments about breastfeeding and breastfeeding advocates that the book loses any credibility.I thought the book was tacky. I am certainly the first to advocate for understanding and acceptance for bottlefeeding mothers, but this book went about it the WRONG way."
5,Excellent quality sanding disk,"I am very pleased with the quality of these sanding disks. They are long lasting. They fit the dust hole pattern on my Porter Cable sander perfectly and have just enough adhesive to stay in place, but remove easily. Just to note, each disk does not have a removable backing. This isn't a problem for me. Just keep the new discs in the box and remove one at a time as needed."
2,Cheaply made,"This is not made of hard plastic like other light saber toys I have bought. It is a very thin flimsy plastic that bends easily. My three-year-old loves fighting with his light sabers, but this one is way too weak to hit anything with it."
4,Porter Cable Stikit Abrasive Roll 100 Grit Sandpaper,"I'm a ""do it yourself"" homeowner who has been using the Porter Cable Stikit sandpaper for years. My 100 grit roll is finally coming to an end after at least 5 years of use. I've used it on my Porter Cable Speed-Bloc Finish Sander for upteen projects. I've even used it sanding drywall seams when I built an in-law apartment. There are several things that I feel make this a superior product. First is the ease of installation. All you need is a flat surface, a utility knife and about 10 seconds. Second is the sanding quality, which is very good. Third is the no waste when attaching to the sander. The entire roll is used because no clamps are necessary. And I've never had a piece of sandpaper shift while on my sander. So I can't think of any reason why not to buy this product."
1,wrong color,I'm not sure why this can't get posted this is my third attempt. I ordered white and got Green. Poor attention to detail will not shop here again.
1,Beckers Simple House,I just couldnt do this CD at all. Becker has some good songs and a good voice but this Cd just didnt do it for me. Also has a great producer in Charlie Peacock. This Album came out in 1991 but is kinda dated by the sound and just doesnt have that oustanding sound that keeps you wanting to listen to it over and over.
1,product key did not work,this was a bad experience for me. seller told me to call norton to solve the problem and norton told me to call the seller. I have to go and buy this product all over again.please make sure your sellers have some responsibility over the product they sell and help the customer with the issues.thanks
1,"Poor quality, poor tech support","Norton Antivirus 2007 (Internet Worm Protection) blocks the built-in VPN functionality of Windows XP Professional. Norton Tech Support are clueless and useless in resolving this issue. More gripes: 1) the /NORESULTS command-line option has been removed; as a result, must log in console to scan computer; 2) during installation, NAV 2007 will delete items in your task scheduler (be sure to save items in your task scheduler before installing)."
1,Don't buy version 2007 .. not compatible with other programs,"I purchased Norton Antivirus 2007 as I have been using Norton for years. But I have to say that Symantec has been going down hill fast since the sell out by Barry Greenstein. And Norton Antivirus 2007 never got installed on my computer after buying it here.When I went to install it, a screen came up saying I HAD to uninstall Spy Sweeper and Zonealarm before installing Norton as the programs are not compatible.Well I don't use Spy Sweeper all that much, so that was okay, but I likes Zonealarm and wanted to keep it. When I went to Symantec tech support, all they would tell me is I could not run Norton 2007 with Zonealarm and I should return it for a refund and then go buy the suite with Norton's Internet Security. That is ""BS"" if you know what I mean!!!"
1,ARH...Annoying Resource Hog,"Have used for three years on three machines. It bogs down your system resources, the updates are not fully automatic and often require time consuming reboot to finish.THE MOST ANNOYING ISSUE IS THE 30 DAY EXPIRATION POPUP which incessantly reminds you you need to repay your annual upgrade ransom at the end of 365 days from first machine install. I will not upgrade again solely becuase of the popup approach (from an antivirus company!).Never has caught anything dangerous on my machines. Waste of money.I bought the 3 machine package last year. Installed the third license on dual boot iMac (Windows) only to find 45 days of remaining coverage. That is really fair. No more money for Norton products.HINT: Try full suite complimentary McAfee for free if you use Comcast highspeed internet service.Wish I could give it 0 stars."
1,Be afraid,"Just got the shaft from Norton. Have a three user license, currently installed on 2 systems but cannot activate third because their database shows 8 installations! Their solution, after hours on the phone and in tech support chat: Buy More! I am so absolutely frustrated with them I am beside myself. Would love to see them hit by a class action. The upside, downloaded Kaspersky. Faster, less intrusive and better protection."
2,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen","NAV used to be one of the best anti-virus packages out there. It's disappointing to see just how bad it's become. I get this free through the university that I work at, but I still uninstalled and paid money for a different package. Major problems include:1) It's a *hugh* resource hog. My computer was pretty much worthless for at least a minute after login due to NAV's virus scanning.2) Buggy. I had different problems with it on two different installs. One time, Windows had to keep killing off some ""missing virus definition"" process after logout. This happened even after doing Live Update. On another install, I had problems right clicking on any file or folder without NAV hanging.3) Difficult to use. The control panel just left me scratching my head.Stay away from this, and go with Kasperski instead. You won't be dissappointed."
3,Disappointed,"The item was very late getting to me, and I had to contact seller several times, otherwise, I would not have gotten it at all. Don't even know if the activation code works yet."
3,"Love the songs, but navigation is difficult","There aren't any tags in this book, so it's difficult to skip straight to the one you are looking for. I was going to use it to leads group of carolers and found it more cumbersome than helpful."
5,An outstanding anthology of thirteen stories,"Author Thomas Vasseur's Discovering The World: Collected Stories is an outstanding anthology of thirteen stories set in the disappearing rural South, the New South, and the grand world at large. Variety spices the tales, from a little boy who discovers the wonder of flight to the rocky relationship between a German woman who has immigrated to the Deep South and her troubled teenage daughter. In the title novella, a ""Southern Native"" and a veteran of the Vietnam War travel to an island in Fiji to repair a damaged sailboat. A common theme of looking within the self unites all the tales, which take a hard look at America's class structure and at human spirituality. Thomas Vasseur's stories are as original and thought-provoking as they are highly recommended."
1,...,"Book was far too long. Thirteen stories was far too many, one or two would have sufficed. Plus, with the great photo on the front I was led to believe there would be more on the inside. Where are the pics??? ..."
5,Life Changing!,"Worth the buy! It will change your perspective on life. Your definition of ""possible"" will be altered! Come and visit the City Church in Kirkland to see Wendell Smith in action and get more of that ""Great Faith""!"
1,I'm a Science Teacher too!,"This book is ridiculous! I also teach science and this book is random in its presentation of concepts. Chapter 2 starts with trying to explain balancing chemical reactions while explaining chemical/physical changes. Then in Chapter 3, it introduces states of matter, gas laws (we're ok so far...), but then throws in Archimedes Law, Bernoulli's Law and Pascal's Law - all of these need time to process the fact that they have to do with forces (which haven't been introduced yet) AND they require mathematical formulas. If you work for Holt, contact me and I'll rewrite the dang thing for you!"
2,more techniques than you can shake a stick at!,"180 pages of more techniques than you could possibly use. The formulas are well explained, the strategies (series of 7, magic number of three, moving averages, exponential moving averages, stochastics, csi, rsi, regression analysis, etc) are also well explained. As somone who has searched for the ultimate formula, oscillator, technique or what ever for trading commodities, after reading this book, I've concluded that you can find a chart or group of charts to justify ANY idea. Given any market, depending on which combination of indicators one chooses, one could justify any decision. Now what good is that?"
5,Still speaks after all these years,"I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out. The turntable and vinyl copy are long gone, but hearing it again on CD was a joy. It is still one of my favorite albums of all time."
1,A good story ruined by a crappy movie,"A good history legend made crappy by overzealous hollywood writers. As is typical of most movies from the mid eighties era. The writing is crappy, the actors could just barely pull it off. And who cares about a lil kid with progeria. Id rather have a real life midget in makeup play the alien than the kid with no acting experiance. This all seems like a Make-A-Wish foundation event gone horribly wrong. Dont waste your money!!!!"
3,Invaders From Mars......Again,"While this version doesnt come close to the original, its not as terrible as some would imply. Karen Black (Linda) does a good job of playing the school nurse to whom little David (Hunter Thompson) can confide. Timothy Bottoms shows beyond a doubt he cannot act his way out of a paper bag and the monsters look like they could have escaped from the H.R. Puff N' Stuff saturday morning show of old. The special effects are pretty good and its a good story to start with. Hopefully the 1953 version will be re-released on DVD so those of us who missed it can enjoy both versions."
2,Theres no place on earth to hide!,"From this terrible dvd that is! IF you don't mind the terrible acting and story, this could be a fairly enjoyable film. The only positive thing to say about this film is the special effects are pretty good for its time. Other than that, it is very bad. Unless you really like B-movies, steer clear, it is that bad."
1,Avoid this one,"kid sees a spaceship crash behind his house, his father goes to check it out and comes back not right, finally it is revealed that the father is really an alien using his fathers body as a host. Then his mother and school teacher becomes aliens as well while they try to lure the kid and the entire town into becoming one of them. Bad acting, weak storyline, bad special effects and the movie just drags on with a terrible ending. I can't believe this is the same director that did the texas chainsaw massacre."
2,eerie B- movie that scared the crap out of kids in the 80's!,"First of all Tobe Hooper gets a PG rating again! That's scarier than The Chainsaw Massacre! I was a beginning horror fan and 11 years old when this little film came on cable, before my mom got rid of it! This scared the crap out of me! A very young boy is watching his family and teacher get possessed by aliens, with little help. This is silly now but at the time really creepy. First of all this was a not a PG movie or an R but at least PG-13! The movie involves a child and is aimed was aimed at the wrong audience at the time. That's because Tobe, who I'm a fan of is not right for this kids horror type of movie without Spielberg involved. Watching it now its just an OK B movie and somewhat entertaining. As a kid I turned it off. I've seen thousands of Horror movies since and eventually,""The Exorcist"" beat this one out! Anyway that's why this one didn't go over big. Tobe realized he needed to stick with the older kids later on."
4,Classic 1950s Horror/Sci-Fi Film,"Kind of makes me think of ""The Thing"". Good acting and actors. Must have for any Sci-Fi/Horror movie collection. I recommend it."
2,Don't believe the hype-- This is badly scripted.,I know the man who scripted this movie is also credited with Twilight Zone episodes. Maybe he had a better editor while working in televison. This feels like it could have been a decent half hour episode-- but it is extended-- until it becomes a chore to watch--Something I've noticed about the early sci-fi movies-- The movies about space exploration are not usually as well done as the movies about alien invasion. You need a certain budget to make spacecraft and alien worlds look believable-- You don't need a really big budget to make an alien invasion look good-- just enough money for a UFO and an alien costume. Forget this movie and check out INVADERS FROM MARS or IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. Both are very well done.
1,"I know it was made in the '50's, but. . . .","I know it was made in the '50's, when sci-fi films were made on shoestring budgets, but this movie is horribly disappointing. I really expected a lot more, especially since screenwriter Jerome Bixby wrote some memorable episodes of The Twilight Zone and Star Trek. The story does little to hold your attention, and the acting is pathetic. A lot of other movies from this era did a much better job of holding audience attention without necessarily having a better budget (see the original version of The Thing). It could have easily been so much better."
5,Argyle Socks,I love this movie...nobody ever seems to know about it. Glad to see some folks here that do!!! I love the crew smoking ciggies and drinking coffee like they are at the local coffee shop. My favorite part though is when the men take off their shoes to sneak up on the creature (who is hiding in the deck below) as the crew descends the spiral stairwell you can't help but notice one of the guys is wearing argyle socks...that was worth every penny!!!
3,"Decent, Influential 50s Hokum","This tightly paced 1950s sci-fi, horror movie was the main inspiration for ""Alien."" ""It!"" is not bad, even though the special effects, sets, and acting are cheesy. The movie is not really scary, but it does have some suspense. If you're expecting a movie on par with today's horror movies, then you'll be sorely disappointed. See this movie with an open mind and enjoy the 1950s vibe, and you'll probably end up enjoying it. As a bonus, one of the characters is played by Dabbs Greer, who was Reverend Alden on ""Little House on the Prairie."""
3,better brother Jack elsewhere,"back beats, repetitive, dated sound effects...Brother Jack has many better efforts elsewhere. Some people may really enjoy this combination of new age and funk, 70s style..for me, it wears thin quickly."
1,Not product pictured,"Didnt receive product pictured. Product had composite and s-video. S-video signal had diagonal black lines. Purchased this because picture didn't have composite video output, only s-video which others have said is a better product than those with both outputs."
1,Made cheaply and to short,"Regardless of the primarily positive reviews this item has gotten the one I received, sold by Amazon themselves, was cheaply made to short, and frayed."
4,A great supplement to the book,"If your child likes the book, he/she will love the video. Even if the child has never read the book, the video is delightful. This video really gives personality to the characters and captures a child's attention. All of the stories are entertaining and are great at stimulating a child's curiosity."
5,Amazing. Hilarious. Must See.,"I originally caught this film on Netflix and couldn't stop watching it. I held onto my rental for so long, I figured I should just buy the DVD already.Now the DVD itself isn't that well produced, it's kind of cheap, but the film is so amazing that the package doesn't matter, it's what's inside that counts.BARSTOOL COWBOY is truly a gem of a film. It's original, well written, and even though the production value is obviously pretty low, the film has heart. I really treasure this film.There is also a sense of humor that the film has that I cannot properly define. It's the type of humor that isn't forced, like big budget Hollywood films. It's organic to the movie and when the laughs come, they hit hard.I've tried to force all my friends to watch this film, some at gun point, but they don't see the magic that I see in it and that's a shame.I look forward to this director's next films."
3,The sound of one hand clapping,"It's an exercise in futility to try and present any multi-day music festival on disc. The net accumulation of music - the quality of any given performance aside - makes production prohibitively expensive and physically cumbersome. I would suggest that while `Woodstock' and `Monterey Pop' comes closest to a duplication of the event via a four CD arrangement, what is missing still exceeds what is presented by orders of magnitude. The problem is exacerbated with two disc sets light `No Nukes' and the `Isle of Wight Festival which become soundtracks of the movies rather than of the show itself.So, what does one make of a 10 song, single CD of the Big Sur Festival from 1970? Good songs by great performers but no sense whatsoever of the event."
3,All installations expire one year from date of first install,"Although this software allows 10 different installations, the expiration date for ALL of them will be the expiration date for the FIRST one you actually install. For example, if you make the first install on June 3, 2007, expiration will be the following June 2008. If you make the second install in August 2007, its expiration also will be the following June 2008. If I had known about this limitation, I would not have purchased. The software itself, of course, lives up to Norton's reputation (excellent) and it is not difficult to install."
1,This cd is a fake.,Don't by this cd it is fake artists. Wonder why they don't say what songs are on it
3,Two Mexican films called Cielito Lindo,"Cielito lindo de 1957 y Cielito lindo de 1936, las dos hechas durante el Siglo de Oro del Cine mexicano.1936 Dir. Roberto Gavald√≥n. Writer, Emilio Fern√°ndez. Perf. Arturo de C√≥rdova, Lupita Gallardo.1957 Dir. Miguel M. Delgado. Writer, Eduardo Galindo. Perf. Rosita Quintana, Luis Aguilar, Carlos L√≥pez Moctezuma. Prod. Galindo Hermanos, Filmadora Chapultepec.Both ""music and drama,"" per IMDb.A film called Cielito Lindo made in 2007 has a contemporary setting and is about restoring a talisman called ""cielito lindo"" to a group of Tarahumara (indians) and has nothing to do with the Mexican Revolution--or with music and comedy.**It is impossible to know whether you are buying both the 1936 and 1957 films contained in one DVD (shown here) without buying the product. So Amazon, how about some better information on the product? Or a good image of the back of the case?"
1,Brassy hair,"It did not do any ""magic"" trick to my hair. I was expecting a good product indeed, but I was not impressed or satisfied therefore I wont purchase it again."
2,If you REALLY like to read about blackjack . . .,"This book works well as in-flight entertainment on the way to a gambling vacation, although Meadow's writing is about as predictable as a cocktail waitress with a 25-cent tip. I'm not sure what that means, but that's a good illustration of Barry Meadow's prose style.Over and over and over and over he employs that technique, which for lack of a better name I'll call sarcastic simile. Card counters are about as popular with casino personnel as Jerry Falwell at a gay-pride parade. Over the long haul, counters are as likely to lose as Mister Rogers is to be caught in a Watts cocaine bust. Mesquite, Nevada, is growing faster than Warren Buffett's bank account. There are probably 200 more examples. If you can put up with that, it's a decent book. If not, imagine being stuck in an elevator with an unfunny version of Dennis Miller. (There -- are you happy, Barry? Now you've got me doing it!)"
4,Haunting,The set and music really made the movie. Juliette Binoche was wonderful as well as Judi Dench (who can do no wrong). The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated and adds to the movement of the film.
3,Just O.K.,"Not as good as I hoped. Let me preface my review with the cuation that this is not the sort of movie I ususally like or watch. However, I thought I would give it a try becuase I really like the actors and it was nominated for so many awards. The english patient isn't my type of movie, but i gave it a shot becuase it won so many awards and i had liked it, so i hoped that might be the case this time. However, (despite the fact that Depp is in it!) this movie was rather lukewarm. It seemed somewhat mundane and unfocused. I saw it maybe half a year ago and nothing jumps out at me about it. It's pretty forgetable. So, if you like sentimental romances, you might like this. If you like something that has a good plot and a backbone, don't go there."
3,Charming and old fashioned,"This is a movie that many find too slight, but it is nonetheless entertaining and a little touching. If you expect too much, perhaps the picture disappoints. If you take it for what it is--a pleasant diversion that reflects on the life's fearful tightness--then it is a small gem. Well worth owning."
4,Mary Poppins for a self-martyred generation,"A Mary Poppin's theme (or the Parcival enters the Grail Castle and does/says the right things to releave the inhabitants of their inauthentic - living death - lives.). This movie, however, is for the self-made outcastes, hypocrital dregs, self-sorrowing martyrs, nearly lost drug adicts, punks, Rebel W/O a Cause sorts etc. of the past (two?) generations - who have made despising life an art - to change their minds and join the living in some sort of human (humane) form. It even has the appealing (to these people) Johnny Depp (a pretty good actor). But it is, none-the-less, Mary Poppins. However, with a twist - she stays."
1,Dullified retro Jive,Was this really nominated for a an Oscar? The bar keeps lowering . All this movie turned up into as a cheesy Flashdance ripoff which was worse than Coyote Ugly if that is humanly possible.Other than the lead actress I never saw so many canned hams in 1 picture
1,Boring pointless story!,"I am just now seeing this movie for the first time in 2010 (lol). However, it is classified as a ""romance"" film so I decided to check it out. This is far from a romantic storyline. I was hoping to see more of Johnny Depp in the film but he had a passing character that showed up mid-film, had a brief encounter with the main character, then disappears again until the end of the film. The whole storyline is dull and pointless. The main character opens a chocolate shop and the town is against it and the mayor goes through everything to sabatoge her store. For what? It's just a chocolate store not a strip club. Who would go through all of that to close down a shop that sells candy? I just found the story to be ridiculous. The acting was excellent, the set, costumes and classic French town were beautiful but the movie left much to the imagination. I was highly disappointed!"
2,Those who have read the novel will likely be disappointed...,"I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed Joanne Harris's novel Chocolat. I thought that viewing the film version would be a way to share this wonderful, rich story with my boyfriend, but I was sorely disappointed!I realize that when a film version of a novel is made, there always have to be some changes. Yet it is possible to stay true to the novel's characters, plot, themes, etc. in the film. This was not the case with the film version of Chocolat. I don't want to give away too much...but significant changes are especially noticable in the central characters, Vianne and Reynaud. The ending of the movie is almost totally different as well. Be warned - Chocolat has practically become a different story!Overall, the characters and plot just did not seem developed enough to make this a satisfying movie. I would highly recommend reading the novel instead!"
5,Great Great Great!,"DVD works great, and the movies great! Chocolat is one of my all time favorite movies - I saw it for the first time when I was on a bus traveling from Lyon to Avignon. And don't worry, Johnny Depp is not the real star here. It's a story about a mother and her daughter and their mystical power on chocolate and people!"
3,Pleasant comfectionary,"I am beginning to fear the pre- emptive titles 'a film by Lasse Halstrom' more and more as he issues forth such lightweight niceties as 'Chocolat' and 'The Shipping News'. True the film is gorgeously shot, and obvioulsy warmly regarded by those involved in its production, but this film borders on simplistic naivety, coming on like an anaemic, charmless, witless version of 'Amelie' through characterisations (such as the mayor) that are way to broad and crudely sketched and caricatured to be anywhere close to enamouring. Through a few tepid patches in the narrative, the film generates a high 'oh get on with it' quotient. All this is redeemed somewhat by Binoche and especially Olin's performances, their luminance enough to acrry the film through most of its moribund patches."
4,Wonderful story,I absolutely love this unique and wonderful story. The acting is great. The story is a modern day fairytale if you like good writing and directing you will like this movie.the story is engaging humorous yet deep.
2,Mildly Entertaining Tale of Libertines vs. Christian Bigots,"""I enjoyed the movie on its own sweet level, while musing idly on the box-office prospects of a film in which the glowing, life-affirming local Christians prevailed over glowering, prejudiced, puritan and bitter Druid worshippers. That'll be--as John Wayne once said--the day."" -- Roger Ebert""Chocolat"" is a paint-by numbers tale of of a confrontation between a village dominated by humorless, legalistic, pleasure-denying Catholics and the pleasure-seeking, chocolate-making Juliette Binoche who seeks to liberate them. The Catholics are for the most part wooden and sterotypical, though not portrayed as outright evil. It all plays out predictably. The ironic thing is that this day in age it is often the politically correct secularists who are the dour puritans while religious people are the ones who just want to be left alone to enjoy life."
5,Chocolat,"I ordered this movie the week before Christmas, and was alerted that it may arrive after Christmas, which was not a problem, given the season. And just as alerted, the movie came the week after Christmas. Even though it was a used purchase, it arrived in good condition and was viewable. It was a Christmas gift for my sister, who was pleased to receive it.Thank you,Andrea Daniel"
2,Disappointing!,I thought this movie was going to be high-quality because of all the hype it received but it was STUPID. To the point where I didn't even finish watching it.
1,"""...relax your intellectual faculties...""","All the women I know -many far more bright than I am- liked this movie. (I suspect a rather different attitude to food and the ""witch complex"" might have something to do with it).I happen to believe that ""magical realism"" has devolved to a nearly protoplasmic state since Borges: so I liked the movie too, as it reaffirmed my belief.People have mentioned several movies that did the same, but better: dare I add to the (long) list, and suggest ""Breaking the Waves"" (a good example of how ""arty chick flicks"" actually can have guts sometimes) or Kubrics ""Clockwork Orange"" (as it shows the consequences of ""Chocolat""s attempt at philosophy)?.Or maybe there just wasnt enough topless scenes. What do I know..."
2,Buyer beware,"The movie is unfair to religious sensibilities. The United States Catholic Conference of Bishops says the move is""Unpalatable fable set during the late 1950s in which a single mother (Juliette Binoche) arrives at a provincial French village to open an enticing chocolate shop during Lent, causing bitterness and opposition from the townsfolk tempted by her rich confections during a season of penance. Director Lasse Hallstrom's film insults with its disingenuous rallying cry for tolerance while it mocks faith traditions, religious tenets and Catholic sacraments. Brief violence, a sexual encounter with shadowy nudity, an instance of profanity and fleeting crass language. The U.S. Catholic Conference classification is (O) -- morally offensive. (PG-13) -- parents are strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 2000 (Miramax)"
2,sugar coated,"My criticism here is about the issue of chocolate. This movie must have had backing by Ghirardelli chocolate, because it seems to be an obvious plug for selling more chocolate. They made it sound like chocolate is good for you. Well it is, the way the Mayans drank it. Nowadays it's loaded with sugar and butterfat, which we're all now finding out how serious the damage is from refined pollutants that sends your adrenals on a roller-coaster ride.Don't believe the sugar-coated acting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche, they're mainstream people who don't understand the messages they have the power to produce. Sure, I sound like a whiny party-pooper, but then, someone had to say this."
3,Just OK,A little does NOT go a long way. Went through the product very fast. The conditioner stained my hands as well. It worked but washed out (not a permanent fix) and ultimately not worth the money
5,Good information.,"Information is the key, My uncle is a war time veteran and he lives in Michigan where Cannabis is legal, I purchased this for him and he said it was useful. Bless him and all veterans."
4,look into pot grower's gardens!,How fun it was to take a full-color tour of forbidden places with Ed. I've thought for years how great it must be as a well known marijuana author...the things they must see.Each garden in the book has an interesting story and it's own unique circumstances making it packed with grow tips. There's lots of pictures and the whole design is coolI would tell my friends to buy this book and because of the reasonable price of 13 bucks they can.
3,Adequate,"I purchased this computer in November of 2003 from Amazon.com. I am not particularly hard on my computers. Since I've bought this computer, I've been extremely busy, and haven't had the free time to do much more than check my email. As a resuly, the computer has essentially been sitting on a desk since I've gotten it.This Saturday, I had to send it in for a repair. The screen completely died. I've only had this computer for five months, and it isn't as though I've been hauling it around, abusing it, or even using it a whole lot. While I'm not saying this is a bad computer--after all, I've only tried this one--I feel obligated to post this problem. The computer has to be sent out to Texas; I'm in Illinois. I'm going to be without a computer for over a month. I like this computer--I really do. Aside from this, it's been a great little notebook. This incident, however, doesn't bode well for its reliability."
4,Rickie-Lee Jones,"pleased I bought it, has some great moments and she is an astonishing musician. Low point is that drummer! Is he a drummer? DId he add anything?"
2,Allergic reaction,"I bought this item to increase bust size but was unable to see results because I had an allergic reaction (rash) after one week of using the oil. When I did use it, it had an awful smell, was sticky, and left a lot of color on my skin. I would not recommend this product."
3,B Grade Fun,"From the title you'd be expecting something pretty daft & not too taxing on the brain. This is what you get with KILLER KLOWNS. That said, this is a compliment. If you are a horror buff or just enjoy the odd helping of pulp this is well worth a look, though it might be a while before you decide to eat cotton candy again. PS: This review is not up to my usual standard as I have had a few beers prior to writing this. ARRRRGGGHHH!!!!"
5,KLOWNZILLA,I Love this movie my favorite part is where the short klown punched off a bikers head I also like the part where one of the klowns drives a guy off the road in an invisible car and than the same klown swallows people up with a shadow puppet my favorite part was where Officer Dave Hansen fought KLOWNZILLA AWESOME
5,"If You Thought You Were Scared Of Clowns Now, Just Wait Until You See This...","I love this movie, it is one of the best sci-fi cult classics (or should that be kult Klassics?) to surface from the 80's.The humor is nerdy, the effects ok and the storyline original.The opening tune from The Dickies is fun too.So if you want a film about just what might happen if a space circus came to town, put this on your must see list, who knows it might just push you over the edge enough to run away and join the circus."
4,An Awesome Crazy Horror Film!!!,"My best friend showed me this movie last night, and I thought it was crazy funny! It reminds me of the classic b-movies from the 1950's. Cotton Candy guns, evil shadow puppets, screaming popcorn, killer pies, balloon hunting dogs and much more await you. An army of sadistic aliens, who resemble clowns land their circus tent in a small American town. Mike and Debbie; a young couple try to warn everyone but nobody believes them. The killer klowns are funny and creepy at the same time. If you love clowns, horror and comedy, you'll love KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE!!!"
1,Worst Ever,"I gave this movie one star because I couldn't figure out the ""no stars"" option.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. At the end, I felt that the Chiodo Brothers owed me 100+ minutes of my life back.If you are a fan of B movies, I would forget this one and see ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" That movie is much funnier.As for Killer Klowns, if you're the kind of person who slows down when passing the scene of an accident, then this movie is for you."
4,Very clever and funny sci-fi movie!!!,"I would guess that most sci-fi movie lovers would think this is one of those movies that were turned out by the dozens in the 70's. Cheap lousy movies with lousy actors that seemed to have a budget of maybe $50. This is NOT one of those movies. It's truly a classic piece of work that has clever use of the whole clown genre. With cotton candy, magic tricks and carnival atmosphere the clowns use everything they can to get their victims.I really enjoyed this movie."
4,A Classic,"I cringe when I see people refer to Killer Klowns from Outer Space as a ""good bad movie."" It's a good good movie, as much as Airplane was a good good movie and it's almost as ingenious as that classic genre spoof. Besides the inherent dark comedy of clowns (I mean come on. Does anyone really think clowns are funny?), these clowns inflict their mayhem as only clowns could do, resorting to a fun house or even a big top of murderous, blood-letting shtick. Some reviewers have dismissed Killer Klowns as a cheapie sci-fi/horror parody with bad acting. The actors may not be Ian McKellen, but this movie is very knowing, very clever, very smart and very good."
3,"One of the Better ""Bad"" Movies","This movie has quite a reputation. I've heard it mentioned many times, and I had a roommate who would beg me to watch it with him on a regular basis. Leave it to Netflix Instant to finally coax me into viewing something I wouldn't normally be interested in. I watched the movie a little over halfway through before I felt like it was a solid buy. I jumped on Amazon and it was on sale for under five bucks! On blu-ray! Now, this is no hi-def treat by any means. But for the price, it was certainly worth it for me and I got to finish the movie a few days later when it finally arrived. This movie is good, but not great as far as low budget ""bad"" movies are concerned. It's certainly no ""Night of the Creeps"", which is perhaps the best hidden treasure Netflix ever gave me!"
4,Killer Klowns is Krazy!,"The movie is a must have if you are a fan of funny, poorly produced and poorly acted horror movies. The movie is great in its cornyness! Even though the budget of the movie shows greatly It still has wonderful Fx and makeup. Alien Klowns arrive in a town Via a flying crius tent. A rookie cop and some college kids are the only ones that can stop the blood sucking klown's evilness! A great movie to watch on a sleepy boring day. Pick it up! it rocks!"
4,Who's Klowning Around?,"4 Stars = ClassicTruly an imaginative, hilarious, sometimes disturbing, sci-fi horror black comedy, cult classic.The ""Klowns"" make up is impressive for such a low budget affair, & their certainly inventive of ways to capture the hapless human victims for a snack later, LOL!Cotton candy anyone?"
1,Every recipe a disappointment,"Every recipe I have tried from this book has been very labor-intensive and a complete disappointment. I'm baffled by all the good reviews here. I am getting rid of this book so that I am never tempted to cook from it again. (For a great everyday veggie cookbook, try Simple Vegetarian Pleasures instead!)"
4,Inventive and Delicious!,My husband and I are not vegetarian but enjoy vegetarian cooking. We get a box of organic produce from a local farm every two weeks and look for novel dishes in which to use them. Roasted Eggplant Strata is out of this world. I've made Bitter Greens with Sweet Onions and Tart Cheese over pasta more times than I can count. The Coconut-Lime Rice is ravishing. The roasted red pepper and walnut paste is as good as aioli. The Stovetop Cassoulet could have had more depth of flavor for the amount of work. I had trouble today with Mollie's coconut macaroon recipe. Luckily she makes herself available for questions on molliekatzen.com via a bulletin board.* I highly recommend this book for those who want to eat well and healthfully. *She did indeed reply; the trouble was my oven!
5,Delish!,"Can't wait to try all of the recipes in here.I'm a meat-cutter's daughter with very little natural inclination with vegetables other than good ol' broccoli and brussel sprouts. I'm looking forward to really making vegetables the center focus, with Mollie (my grandmother's and daughter's name) the teacher!"
1,She's running out of the ideas...,"I regret I bought this one.While her very first one (the moosewood cookbook) is full of very creative and very tasty dishes, in this book she is merely trying to scrounge any ideas from any sources (her childhood memories, very common dishes with little changes...).To make the recipes appealing and in a way deluding (b/c they are not really good or her own), and for her fun, she loaded the book with so many of her paintings--- which may be whimsically cute, but not artistic.And even some of the recipes I tried turned out to be very bland, many times not tasty at all.I don't try the recipes in the book any more.But I do still use her other book (the moosewood) quite often.--it is a very good one."
2,Beamtracer is not informed,"I have to disagree with beamtracer's comments. This book has some very basic info, and mr. beck seems to not cover as much as mr. ablan. I'll give you an example - the ablan books inform you not only what to do, but why you're doing it, and add to that the variations which are possible. This book just suggests to perform a function (such as create text) without telling you how to load text, text options, or mac users.The examples are extremely simplistic and like lw applied, it should not have a v.7 in the title as it's clearly not written for anything involoving lightwave 7. Why are these publishers saying it's for v.7? There is a ton of stuff not covered dealing with lw 7. If they're not going to cover it, then don't put it on the title. I was hoping to find more useful real world examples using particles or expressions or better modelling.-Molly Grant"
5,Tremendous sound in a small box,"I purchased this radio for my work cubicle. It replaces a very old clock/radio purchased many moons ago. Wow! What a difference - high quality sound, easy to use buttons and doesn't take up much space. Although taller than my old clock/radio - the footprint is about the same. It is also a good looking unit - would work on anyone's desk - in the mailroom or the boardroom.The digital tuning is one of the features I like the best - as radio signals can be pesky around Hartford.I bought this unit, after my husband purchased one for his office and raved about the sound and quality. Well he was right!If I ever need another clock/radio/cd player - this will be the one - but I don't expect to need another one for my office - as Sony products are very high quality.Highly recommended!"
4,Quite satisfied,My search was for a CD player combined with a clock radio that would play not only retail CD's but also music burned onto a CD from the computer. I purchased a remanufactured Sony that had not only this ability but also the promise of good sound. Now close to a year later I am quite pleased with the quality of this unit and the features. It lacks a battery back up for the time function but overall I find it to be a well built stereo player and well worth the price.
3,OK product,This product is fairly good. It has limitations and issues that shouldn't be in a Sony product. The CD player is good but shouldn't have the noise from the rotation mechanism. It is not difficult to set up but not easy. There is no backup power source to keep the time and alarm active.
2,Maybe their worst album,Their previous album Primitive was a good one with many differences and new elements. But the basic principle was rhythm . Well in this albums the tracks lack the good compositions and rhythms to make you like this album. This album is even worst than their first album Soulfly (another bad album ). I hope they change in the future.
4,Soulfly F&(^'s S&!% Up,This album like the other self titled Soulfly album reaches out to you and Downstroy is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I recommend this album just to hear Downstroy. The first 4 songs make this cd worth buying because1. Downstroy has really sweet repeating riffs2. Seek n strike here we go!! has a good getting through everything feel3. enter faith is kinda repetative but stands up for SOUL power (religion)4. One is another good song by soulfly One God One faith One Life (shows that everybody has similar senses so they should be able to relate better)5.-9. a bunch of unrelated stuff to the cd but Brasil's lyrics translated is sorta soulfly -like and 9-11-01 is a good tribute.10.-14. more soulfly is good.
1,Rehash rehash rehash,"This is the ultimate rehash album, half the songs actually contain riffs that are exactly like other songs Max has done in the past. Seriously, Max needs to get some creativity back or just retire."
3,"SOULFLY 4 ""PROPHECY""","Screw this Cd check out ""prophecy"" their next Cd, comes out March 30th. trust me all you headbangers hear the song at soulfly.com Its ""prophecy"" ok...hear it till the ending of the song whooo! now thats headbangin' I didn't knewthat Max had his hidden rage all inside of him........he should let it out ...alot!!I recommend you soulfly fans to get the next CD Im going to preorder it hahahahha!"
3,more like 3.5 star...,"Soulflys debut was a definite classic, so when they followed it up with primitive, it made me wonder where this bad was going....in my opinion, primitive was embarassing to listen to and tried to be diverse but instead was more of a mockery. So I had my doubts about 3. Then i saw them live again which restored my faith, so I gave 3 a try. I was pleased. 3 isn't doesnt stray to far from the sound that ""soulfly"" had, and thats a good thing. Right off that bat ""downstroy"" cuts like a knife and leave you nothing to do but nod your head with a grin during the breakdowns. All in all if you liked the first soulfly realease, you will love this album."
2,Not what I expected. To Unoriginal,Well I am a Soulfly fan and an even bigger Sepultura fan new and old. Soulfly 3 was just primitive remade again with too many special guest except this time they didnt mention who everyone was. If you read the lyrics and listen to the music closely you can clearly see the unoriginality in many of the songs. For example the intro to the song brasil is the same intro to the Sepultura classic attitude except it was just speeded up. And in the song seek and strike you can see that many of the lyrics are similar to lyrics from attitude as well. Unlike Soulfly Sepultura had taken a new route in their music and both there albums were a great success with many new classics such as choke and sepulnation. Well Max your first album was good but you really need to change your ideas because the Roots day's are over and its time to find something new. So bette rluck next time and I better be blown away when I see you guys opening up for Slayer on August 13th.
4,Excellent Quality set,"greay head set, it it were wireless and worked this good you would have this as an industry standard."
3,for the price its good,this mic works good but eventually it gets a little uncomfortable if you play for long hours. It kind of feels like its just there on your ear and might fall off but you can use it left or right.
3,its okay...,"simply put the item itself is slightly uncomfortable especially for glasses wearers, it has problems picking up your voice so you have to speak loudly and slowly(which wont work very well in games like FPS)and you have to always bend and play around with it to get some recognition and still it will be alot lower than others, however you do hear everyone clearly its better than the basic xbox model since people with big heads can wear it but if like me you'll be thinking about sacrificing some game buying cash on a higher quality one"
3,an ok headset,this headset is ok but it has some issues. 1 its too loose on your head. 2 the mic is in a bad spot. 3 audio control is horrible because the adjuster is in the middle of the cord on a crappy clip.
2,Not for me - too small,"I'm considering selling mine on ebay after only 2 weeks. It's hard to get the mic itself to come around to being in front of my mouth and I've had several complaints about being too quiet. I have been able to force it over but it really needs a longer mic stalk. I have also not found it as comfortable as so many reviews here led me to believe it would be. It's usuable but I really think I would like to find something else. I consider my head, ears, etc. to be of pretty average size so I don't think it's just my physique leading to these problems."
5,great buy!,My nephew was so excited to receive four Free Willy dvd's for his birthday. He already had one dvd but it was cheaper to buy this collection than each dvd indivually.
4,Durable set,"Heavy duty and sturdy design, this set is not for the weak handed. Great gift for the die hard summer and or all season griller."
2,It's a little out there...,"The words, ""Are you kidding me?"" came to mind a lot while reading this. I thought it would be about early childhood education. It was... a little bit. The main message of the book is that women and minorities are so picked on in education. Um... NO- I am NOT picked on just because I am female. I chose to go into education and will not whine about my circumstances. The author seems to indicate that we should all become whiners and attack the men in education."
1,Dont waste your time,Please dont waste your time reading this book. It's one of the worst book i've read in a long time. The story line is really disjointed and there isn't any real meaning to the ending.
3,An interesting read,"I read this book because I found the premise to be very interesting. I agree with other reviewers that the plot was somewhat disjointed and the ending a bit ubrupt. May, the main character, is by far the most interesting of the bunch. I pretty much skimmed through all the parts that revolved around the other characters. I believe the story could have been a lot more developed and one does feel a bit dissatisfied at the end but I'm not sorry I read it, if only for the history lesson in the brutal ritual of footbinding."
3,"Good, but not great","You know the drill - East meets West, conflict ensues - yada, yada, yada. Good writing, although some of the events in the novel are just plain harsh and will make even the most jaded cringe. The novel is well researched, and should definitely hold your attention. I particularly liked the explanation of binding - what it is, how it's done, why it's done. That said, the only thing that I really didn't like was the end, it seemed flat and a little contrived. And the dysfunctional relationship may seem a bit too convenient, but you have to have some conflict in a novel, and most of the conflict here is character driven."
3,Slightly better than reading a ceral box,"Well, once again I pick up a book with great hope & end up disappointed. Like other reviewers I found the constantly changing narrative difficult to follow and extremely distracting. By the end of the book I hated it. I thought the ending of the book was terrible!!!Once more I am left convinced that I have already read all the really good books."
2,Flashy but unsatisfying,"Pretty at first glance, but lacking sufficient substance. A book for high end people who want to know the expensive exclusive places to shop/eat. The book devotes a lot of space to larger than usual photographs of the establishments reviewed but without labeling the photos, so you are frequently not sure which goes to which. On the left page you might have 5 places reviewed, on the facing page 4 photographs: Sometimes you can guess the correlation, many times not. Only a few very stylish hotels are reviewed. Most of the outdoor photographs are dullish as if taken on a cloudy day. The city is divided into sections and broken down with maps of the restaurants, bars, cafes, shops in that are. This would be a great book if you are very interested in shopping for women's clothing and accessories. For all it's promise, was almost pretty but not worth the money. The cover became separated from the binding after about 6 weeks on my copy."
1,come ON people,"This book is absolutely ridiculous. Obviously someone with a delusional, gigantic ego wrote this fictional book. I have a friend reading this and eating up every word and it just makes me sick. There was nothing in this book that made me believe that it is true. The only thing the author is good at is twisting recent changes in the Church and making them appear evil. As someone who is active in the Church I can tell you he good that has come about because of the changes from Vatican II. Do not believe the lies portrayed in this book!"
4,Giant Mollusks,"This is an excellent low-budget movie of the 50's about giant mollusks. In an underwater earthquake ""prehistoric"" eggs, which look like half inflated balloons, are disrupted and then hatch (radiation get the blame once again). The giant mollusks suck all the liquids from the bodies of their victims. This movie is worth watching."
3,no real challenge to the world,"good monster movie for 30 mins, very good even, but after that the plot dissappears and we have to endure the romance between tim holt (way past his prime, no matter how many times the other members of the cast try and assure us otherwise) and some starlet...And really the monster doesn't challenge the world like a harryhausen one usually does, it doesn't attack a city or anything... film is in desperate need of such a climax and some editing of the padding in the middle.good midnight movies fare"
1,Bad movie but needs a better presentation,"OK, I'm not going to say anything about the film itself.This is a DVD review and NOT a movie review.The DVD is a pan-and-scan. Therefore the DVD automatically gets negative 100%. Nothing else needs to be said.MGM needs to release this again in the proper screen format.What a great day for movie buffs when butchers who chop up films to fit TV screens are forced to seek work recycling bottles, and scrounging in dumpsters,"
2,Like watching paint dry...,"... except that I think that I'm being unfair to paint. There are movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space that are so bad they're good. There are movies like Monster-a-Go-Go that are so bad they're simply torture. But Mars Needs Women is a whole new kind of bad: it's a movie which is so incredibly boring that you'll need some heavy stimulants to stay awake through it all. This film is only for the hardest of the hard-core bad movie buffs, and the only reason to watch it is to say that you did. If you're in this category, my advice is to watch it for 20 minutes, do something else more interesting (you won't have any trouble finding something -- even staring off into space would do it) and then watch another 20 minutes etc. until you're done with it. I give it one extra star because I actually liked what little plot there was -- properly edited, it would have made a decent half-hour movie. I sleep now."
3,Grand and flawed,"A long overdue book---a compilation of hundreds of essentially contemporary documents and other accounts concerning the Alamo battle, which comprise its main strength. It's a pity the editor felt it necessary to comment on each historical issue rather than let the accounts speak for themselves, since he falls into the same, subjective, ""I-have-a-hunch"" trap of so many writers on this subject. E.g., he gives the questionable account of ""Ben"" more weight than those of Mexican officers regarding Crockett's demise, and on the question of the location of the Alamo flag, completely ignores the drawing by Captain Sanchez-Navarro that explicity places it atop the church. As a source book on the Alamo, this tome stands alone. As reliable scholarship on the subject--reader beware!"
1,Too scary for little ones.,"My 1-and-a-half year old loves Olie and the other two videos, but this one was much too scary for him. It is also awfully short."
3,smaller than pictured,"This was a gift, so I have not used the item myself. It arrived in a timely matter and in good condition but was surprisingly small. It folds to fit on a cardboard display package. But even unfolded I don't see how a whole rack of ribs could fit on this."
4,Love this singer,"I thought I already had all of Annie Herrings CDs and was thrilled to find another one to add to my collection. She is one of my favortie gospel singers. If you like Annie Herring, you will be happy with this one."
1,No quantity listed.,"I can't tell you how good the product is, because I haven't purchased it yet. I am still trying to find out how many disks you get for this price!!! If it is price for 1 it is way too expensive, if it is for 100 it is a good price, if it is for 50 it is just an ok price."
4,The ultimate advanced origami book,"If you have entered the realm of the origami seniors, then your collection is incomplete without this book. The discussion at the beginning dealing with the history, art, logic and science of origami is superb, and the 24 models range from the very high intermediate to the seemingly impossible! The setback is that diagrams and instructions are on different pages and that makes it a little hard to follow, but the diagrams are at least clear enough. Do not buy this book unless you take origami very seriously. I have had it for almost two years and three of the models in the book (Elephant, Knight on Horseback and Butterfly) continue to stump me even to this day!"
1,Not good,"I agree with the negative rating, this does not sound original at all, poorly done. I will look for another; I hope I find something original."
3,"Product is great, seller is not.","I received this product in an appropriate amount of time. However, I'm very familiar with Aveda products & know exactly how they smell and this didn't smell like Aveda AT ALL. I'm wondering if the conditioner was just an off-brand that was put in an Aveda container. I've bought this specific Aveda conditioner from other stores/ vendors and this is the only time it's smelled different."
2,Sanding discs that wear out too quickly...,I bought these discs because they were a great price but having used them now I am finding they wear out super fast. I went through 3 discs just cleaning up the top of a table that was not too rough to begin with. The grit on the discs disappears and leaves the paper smooth after a few minutes of use. They did the job in the end but my more expensive discs last longer and don't wear out as fast. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Bad disks,"The reviews said the Mirka discs lasted a long time. They would if I could get them to stay on the sander. I have used many different brands of discs and have never had this problem before. The velcro on the back seems to be very thin and seems to stay on the sander about 15 to 20 min. If you take one off to change grit, it won't stay on at all if you try to use it again. Bad product."
2,The Bracelet,"This book was mistakenly placed in my preschool classroom and read to the children by another teacher. If you are planning to buy this book be aware that some of the themes in the book may not be appropriate for children under 6-7 years old. This book deals with a child being taken away from home, friends and family then losing a prized possesion. The book also includes talk about war and soldiers with guns. My class had difficulty understanding why Emi was being taken away. This book is more suited to children much older."
3,okay,"The blue tool is okay. It feels very hard but does loosen up tight muscles. Ofcourse it can't give you the sort of relief that a massage therapist's hand does; that human touch cannot be replicated. I was hoping to be as thrilled as many other reviewers who are ecstatic with this product, but that did not happen for me. I haven't yet tried the small cream colored tool."
3,Neat Gift,"I ordered this Body Back Buddy for my husband who experiences a pesky knot in his shoulder from a muscle tear. I wanted to get him something he could use on himself when I wasn't around to help rub the knot out. It really comes in handy after a hard work-out and it does help put pressure on those hard to reach spots and trigger points. If you sit at a desk for long periods of time (or drive long distances)and have tension in the shoulders you should give this a try. It can come in handy and the plastic is really good, solid and sturdy. However, this is one of those items that can wind up in the back of a closet or in your next yard sale."
4,Works pretty well,This product works pretty well. You just have to spend some time learning the right angles to give you relief. The small one that comes with it doesn't work that well. It doesn't provide enough leverage.
5,Spagetti Jesus,"I have to admit, I bought this single not because I'm a fan of Yo la Tengo, but because I'm a huge fan of the Upright Citizen's Brigade. For those of you who don't know the wonders of the UCB, this is a picture of Colby (played by Amy Poehler) during the Spagetti Jesus (Spirituality Expo) episode. When I found this cd (at Borders, no less) I started laughing hysterically, & it's safe to say it made my week. After listening to it a few times, I'm not really impressed, but again, I'm not really a Yo la Tengo fan either. So I guess the point is, the Upright Citizens Brigade rocks & so does Yo la Tengo since they used the picture for their cd cover. That's all."
5,Conrad's characters sizzle!,"Another great read from Linda Conrad. Lainie and Sloane drive each other stark raving crazy - in more ways than one! He's trying to protect her body and she's trying to protect her heart. The attraction is inevitable and, as Conrad's fans have come to expect, so is the danger. I won't spoil the ending, but readers who resist peeking will love the last line...as much as the first."
1,Not gonna happen,This album was cancelled due to copyright issues involving use of certain sound samples.
1,Save your money!,"I understand how alluring it can be to sing some of the beautiful music in the Bel Canto repetoire, but there are some things people should not sing! This CD was given to me as a gift. I listened to it once and could take no more! It is currently serving as a coaster on my coffee table. It is most ridiculous how one can have pitch problems on a CD that is recorded in a studio. I do not understand it one bit. Save yourself money and a severe headache!"
3,Makes no sense!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book (it was a good exercise in my vocabulary!), but it made no sense!! How can a gypsy boy be soulmates with a young patrician girl? Why doesn't he succeed? What is Bronte trying to tell us? Frankly, I was frustrated trying to decipher the meaning of this novel. I was required to read it for an English course, and I would not read it again because it is so frustrating!"
3,Limited strong light output hurts usefulness,"This product is handy and well made, but its light output weakens so quickly that its usefulness is quite limited. My flashlight will produce about two minutes of quite strong light, followed by a long stretch of 'night light' strength that doesn't do much good at all. If I had to do it over again, I'd try another brand."
4,"Warm, warm, warm!","Good fit, true to size. Very comfortable under clothing (unlike regular thermals). Spent an entire 20 - 40 degree day outside and these silks kept me toasty. Did not shrink after washing/hang dry. Very good purchase!"
2,It's too thin,"And on the Amazon website, the product description says can be machine washed, but the label says hand wash only."
2,Okay.,"Bought these for my husband last year. He's worn them a few times, likes the feel. Unfortunatly I got him red (go Rutgers!) and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear. I'd think for the money they wouldn't bleed."
5,Mirka 8-hole H&L sanding Disk Review,I have been using multiple grits of this sanding disk by Mirka on my wood working projects. It is very easy to apply with the Hook & Loop feature and has performed well. It does not leave circular scratches and is best used climbing through the grits. I have used between 80-grit to 220 grit and each disk delivers as advertised. I would not recommend using this for sanding wood that has any hardened glue or other finish since it will reduce the life of the paper however this is common for most sand papers. I plan to continue using this product on my orbital sander since it performs well at a fair cost.
1,Author fails in proving her point,"The author'e premise is that Dante used marijuana ( !!?) , and that led him to write his most esteemed works.Obviously this is wild and unfounded speculation and makes the author look unprofessional and unschooled. She fails miserably in her ""proof"" of that fallacious and malicious speculation.Fans of Dante,the world's greatest poet ever , will want to steer clear of this pile of nonsense, and the author , Barbara Renalds, should attend a school where Dante is taught properly!Have a great day."
5,Great,"I bought these for my Dewalt orbital sander and they work great. I use them for bulding furniture and use my sander in tight spots that I probably shouldn't and they stick great, never fall out or get out of alignment. They last a long time."
2,Sub-Standard Sand Paper,"This sand paper leaves a lot to be desired. If you have a lot of sanding to do you had better purchase a lot of these sanding discs. In no time it seems they are all used up and aren't doing the job. I might have got these from a bad lot, but I think I will stick with Norton."
2,Discs wear out too fast ...,"I bought these discs along with some others but as I said in the other review the discs wear out super fast even thought they did get the job done. I just ended up using more discs than I would have if I had used my more expensive brand. Once again, you get what you pay for. However, if you just want to do a little light sanding for a smaller job on softer wood surfaces these might just be right for you."
4,Masterpiece,"I am not really that big a fan of the band, but a tremendous fan of this album!It is truly a masterpiece. Yes it is dark and melancholy, but it is true art. The soundscape is magnificent, I marvel at the atmosphere they create. The back cover features an angel holding his head in what could be agony or frustration, and that is what this sounds like. Beautiful agony! To quite from the title track: ""Happiness in a broken vision"".And most importantly, the album is a cohesive whole, not just a bunch of songs stuck together in a compilation. Listen to the full artwork, not just individual songs, and you might appreciate the journey it takes you on."
4,Prince Joe,Good read with lots of intrigue. It moves fast but lingers too long in the romance areas. The other parts are very well written.
2,MAJOR REMIX,"Review title says it all! If you've read any of her other stuff, this will be totally boring. She has explained most of the chakra stuff in her other books. If I had to read anyone else's chakra-related story, I was gonna scream!!Can't think of any reason to purchase or read this one!"
4,Everyday Sacred stories,"At last the power of the invisibles in our ordinary, everyday sacred lives is being valued and highlighted. Well done."
4,Caroline Myss - another blockbuster,"As usual, all Caroline Myss books are relevant and straight to the point - makes you really think about what you are doing in your life."
4,A good read for children,"This book may be dated, being that its time span ends in 1998, after Tony Gwynn's second World Series appearance, and that he would pass the 3,000-hit mark in 1999 and play his last major-league game in 1991. However, for a book aimed at a juvenile audience it is very well-written with a great attention to detail. This story about a modern-day athlete who, in addition to being one of baseball's greatest hitters (eight National League batting titles, tied for the record with Honus Wagner), has been an outstanding citizen and role model, is one that children, not only those who are sports fans, should read."
5,Absolutely the Greatest!!!,"I don't know how else to explain how much of an impact this man has had on my musical life. Every since I was about 5! I remember back in the day riding with my pops in his dark blue chevy pick up ....bumping Mr. Magic!!! That's when I discovered how much I loved jazz and Mr. Washington made it happen! Whenever I'm sad...i throw in Grover...doesn't matter which CD it is...because they all are the bomb. But Mr. Magic is my joint...and it always lifts my spirits!!!Anyway, enjoy the album...and don't hesitate to get it if you haven't already!!! He's a musical genius and you must ...ABSOLUTELY MUST experience him!!!Beetle aka Tonya :-)"
3,B-Movies on a budget.,The Alien Invasion DVD includes the following four fifties science fiction films.Unknown World (1951)The Day the Sky Exploded (1958)Phantom from Space (1953)Crash of Moons (1953)None are great but taken as a whole the set makes a bargain package of low budget 50's science fiction. Quality of all the films is fair and as an extra ; chapters of a Flash Gordon serial are included as well. (There is a link from imdb linking the British Sci-Fi film Thin Air to this package. It is not on it.)
4,mirka sanding discs,"good paper with a very good life. the only complaint would be, the paper often has a high piece of grit which leaves a scratch pattern and doesn't show up until you stain the wood. The most commonly seen occurance is on Oak, the other woods seem to not show this. The answer of course is to sand with a finer and then a finer grit.A tedious job when you have 30 or so doors to sand."
5,Thank you,"For continuing to drive home the message that what customers really want are awesome, inspiring, exceptional experiences! With so much competition out there it's amazing that some companies are still not focused on this."
4,"""He's definitly trouble""",The movie was good. Another blaxploitation film to add to your 1970's collection.
2,Oooooooooooooooooooook...lol,"Without Marvin?????? Anyways, what is that suppose to mean. I don't know what the cat was listening to but you can tell he don't know anything about Marvin Gaye, because he (Mr. Gaye) did the whole soundtrack, and as far as that somebody else singing....it was Marvin. Anyways, getting back to the movie, it was so-so, it was trying to be Shaft, but without the depth...being that it was an blaxploitation flick, it was what it was...it was so-so @ best. The soundtrack is what made the movie..."
5,THANK YOU FOR AN 800!,"I credit my 800 on SAT Chemistry mostly to this book (partly to McGraw-Hill's). It has an impressive depth of explanation that is easy to follow, and doesn't miss a thing."
3,Maybe this is what some people are looking for...,"..., but it was not what I wanted to read. I love to read about baseball, and especially about 19th century baseball. However, this book deals more extensively with the management of the early leagues, and the development of the rules, administration, the problems of revolving, etc. I wanted to read about Ross Barnes, Deacon White, and the other great players of the era. I've seen the stats, but I am still looking for the book that will bring the National Association players back to life. (Any suggestions?)Like I alluded to at the beginning, this may be just what you want to read. But if you are looking for a book about the players and what happened between the foul lines (and in the saloons), you might want to look somewhere else. (I much prefer David Nemec's ""The Beer And Whisky League,"" on the narrower topic of the AA.)"
3,Entertaining but Unremarkable Drake,"A good read, but Drake has done better. Some of the events and character decisions just didn't quite ring true. Enjoyable, and worth reading for those who like David Drake's work. If you don't know Drake's work yet, go find a copy of THE FORLORN HOPE or WITH THE LIGHTNINGS or perhaps KILLER."
2,Sub-Standard Sanding Discs,"It seems as though these discs don't last as long as the editorial sais. You'll need to buy twice as many to get the job done. I might of got a batch from a bad lot, but I think I will stick with Norton from this point on. I am very disappointed in these discs."
2,Not for this price!,"It is a decent headset, but for the price, I expected so much more. I am sensitive to those who have to listen to me, and the feedback I get is that when I place the mouthpiece in just the right spot (about an inch from the corner of my lips, and at the exact same elevation), the sound is tolerable. The earpiece is plastic, and snaps off of the unit rather easily. It is just a matter of time before I lose it. It does not look like the unit will travel well, which is when I need my soft phone the most."
1,Not what I was expecting,We currently upgraded our phone system to a VOIP Shoretel solution and bought 20 Plantronics CS50 USB Headsets for our call center. Initially the volume was too low to even hear the callers voice. We adjusted our phone system to the max (were told nobody has ever gone above a 3 and we are at an 8 max) and all the Windows volume settings turned as high as they can go. At this point the volume is acceptable but nowhere near what it should be. When contacting Plantronics support they advised us to buy there newest model out. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!!
2,Anyone else?,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas because he works from home and I wanted him to be able to move through the house with ease. However, the last two weeks he has reported having problems with customers hearing him on the other end as well as it requesting to be charged after it has been removed from the charger. I'm wondering if anyone else has had any problems with this item!The item worked great the first week of use, just started having problems in the last week."
4,Good Overall,"I am using with Dragon NaturallySpeaking so i can dump my wired headset. It works pretty good. There is a small delay and a little extra training of the software required...but it does eliminate the wires, which is nice."
1,VERY disappointed...more like carnival mirrors,"The image shows 3 clear reflections, when in fact what you get looks more like a mirror from a carnival. The type when your head looks huge, your body small and crooked and your feet nonexistent. I was very much looking forward to seeing my 2yo play with his reflection, but he pretty much ignores these mirrors. I feel the product description and images are quite deceiving."
5,There were Two Trees in the Garden,This is an awesome book. It deals with your flesh and your spirit. That is what the two trees are.
5,Revelations,"Occasionally you read a book that opens the door to your heart for an amazing revelation from God. This is one of those. The author begins by showing that there is just as much death in the knowledge of good as there is in the knowledge of evil. It sounds simplistic, but this book helped me shift my focus from trying harder to growing more in love with Jesus getting to know more of him. The change is amazing. I highly recommend the book."
2,Not overly informative,"Honestly, the only way to help a loved one understand depression is to talk to them about it. Do some research on the internet about the symptoms, common issues and what to look out for. I don't expect someone to read a book about depression because no case is the same."
1,"Inconsistent sound, over-filtered tracks, good booklet.","This budget set seems to be made up largely (or entirely) of material lifted from earlier reissues. I think many of the 'newly remastered' recordings are simply filtered versions of other recordings I already have in my collection. In general, the sound is bland, mid-rangy, over-filtered and lifeless. There is SOOOOO much more sound on these recordings than this release lets us hear. The material itself is great -- basically the Bix everyone wants! The booklet is superb. But sorry -- I can't get around the inferior sound. You get what you pay for."
2,A Nasty Bit of Reading,"Feherty is good at one-liners, but a piece of fiction?.. NO!There are far too many characters here, many of them with more than one name, as first names, last names, and nicknames appear at random. After the first couple of chapters, I thought this funny story had potential, but the more pages I turned, the more disappointed I became.Stay with the CBS microphone, David."
3,Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Guide to Motorcycling Excelle,"A review of the MSF course I took. A lot of technical explanations I couldn't get, such as degrees of lean angle. I would have preferred this to be an easier and simpler read."
1,"Not a good paper, disappointed","Unfortunatley, This paper is useless, despite the gloss, the ink smeared immdiatley even during printing. I am much much happier with the matte version, Hammermill color copy paper, (green apple on front) which gets 5 stars in my book, It is supreme, professional paper, the best. Sorry the gloss is bad, because the ink smears within seconds."
2,Disappointed,"The stick was bulkier/thicker than Revlon's makeup correcting stick, which made it difficult to use on my upper eye lid (to remove spots of mascara). The product itself worked fine, just wish it was a thinner stick."
4,fun series,"I enjoyed the program. It is really just for entertainment, but some info can be gleaned for it. makes be remmber the goodtime when I lived in Alaska."
2,If it wasn't for the likable stars...,"Though the main idea for this show is clever enough as no good Earl Hickey tries to make up for past misdeeds after discovering the concept of Karma (a concept which he never fully understands), the jokes are weak and far more tasteless than they are witty. I, for one, am cool with tastelessness as long as a modicum of wit is perceptible, say as when South Park's Cartman declares that he's HIV positive he has AIDS.If it wasn't for the likable stars (really all of them), no one in their right mind would watch this show as it has very little to offer. On the other hand I find it hard to leave the room when my roommates watch it mainly because the stars of the show seem to be having fun even if they know they're slumming. Ultimately they're the show's strength."
2,Stupid TV types for LYING is BAD KARMA,Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING .... and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free .... don't support these writers ...
3,Only one problem,"Most of the discs in the season of shows were fine, but one episode of one disc is messed up. Cleaning with a DVD cleaner has not resolved the problem. Shipping was prompt. No other issues, but it was disappointing to lose an episode."
1,Three to one,"I have purchased this brand of sandpaper before and I thought it was just fine sandpaper, that is before I received a free sample of 3M sandpaper,I was shocked to discover that it took three Mirkasandpaper disk to do the same area that a single 3M sandpaper disk was able to accomplish the same area. while I do not believe you get what you pay for his true in all cases it is the case when it comes to cheap sandpaper and 3M sandpaper."
1,False Advertisement,They have a photo of a larger size and send you the smaller one. The ounces are even off. What a rip off. Now they wont even answer! Scam!
2,Watery Chicken Soup,"Got this based on reviews. First time I've been snookered on that basis. I'm sixty-something and found this book sappy, couldn't last past 3 stories. Guess I don't fit the ""profile."" I do, however, remember one review referring to it as sappy (the only negative one), and now I find that review missing. Is this a way Amazon pushes book sales? By upping review averages? Gave this two stars instead of one because based on the title I should have had a tipoff as to the mishmosh inside. Follow your gut instinct."
5,These discs work well,"Bought a box of these for paint removal and they work well, adhere to the sander perfectly and don't clog up with paint too badly--think I would get the 60 grit next time, however as it would take the paint off faster."
2,shipping is too slow.,"I have no problems with Ridata, but I do have something to say about Amazon shipping. placed my order on 2/20/05 for Ridata DVD-RW and checked its status on 2/22/05: NOt Yet Shipped, Estimate Shipping Data is 2/28/05 which is way beyond the 24 hours which they say they will usually ship. can't take it, so just cancelled my order."
4,"Ok, but","Well, i've bought this item but when it arrived it wasn't the original case as shown in the picture, well..... the games are very good so far as i've played it before."
5,Best RPG Ever? Maybe....,"This game is so much fun. There's so much to do, and you can never do it all. Good, Evil, you decide which you are!"
3,"Good Game, but not great","Both of these games are adictive at first, but lack much substance. the constant one way aproach and short length of the game makes it a little dull after a while. Peronaly I think the ripped off the RIFTS RPG series. RIFTS is also post nuclear apocolyptic, and the Enclave and Brotherhood of Steel resemble the RIFTS' Coalition. At first the game is so adictive that you cant stop playing and after you beat it you put it up and never play it again. Good game, but not great"
2,"Maybe I'm spoiled, but ...","Fallout is a turn-based game, and I prefer real-time games like Diablo II and Baldur's Gate far better. Fallout just seems too slow."
5,Great Replacement for Tranquilizers,"When I was in the seminary, this record is what you were likely to hear walking down the hall on any given evening. Whatever one might think of it musically or simply aesthetically, it might serve a purpose as a replacement for certain anxiety relieving pill for Catholics fed up with the vagaries of the faith community."
1,a Major Disappointment,"Very poorly researched, contains numerous inaccuracies and fallacies about a number of issues. I wonder what became of the Germaine Greer who did write positive things for the women's movement, this obviously was NOT written by her."
1,The facts I can check are WRONG.,"My area of special knowledge is in Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. Professor Greer's wanton disregard for the facts of this condition is frightening in such a book. If the remainder of her ""facts"" are similar the book is a disaster."
2,Very fragile,"My husband and I got these for a wedding present and they are quite cute, but they are very fragile. My husband broke a glass while washing it and cut his finger badly. Let's just say we learned our lesson about thin glasses."
1,Handle with Care,These are very nice looking glasses and are comfortable in the hand but unfortunately they are extremely fragile and break easily. I believe I have 2 left from my original set of 8. One time I was drinking from the glass and put it down (normally - I didn't slam it down or use too much force) and when I next picked it up it had a large crack down the side. The glass is very thin and it just seems that anything can cause them to fracture. I really like the look of the glasses and would certainly buy more if they didn't break so easily.
2,And then there were three...,"These glasses are very pretty but not very hardy. Out of a set of 8, I only have three left. I handwash all my dishes and all five glasses broke as I washed them. Would not recommend. Currently on the lookout for better quality."
1,THEY BREAK SO EASILY!,These glasses are beyond ridiculous. They break way too easily. We are now down to 2 and while I'd buy them again to match the smaller glasses...I'll probably just buy a new set.
4,Great shoe,"I buy only black tennis shoes and this is my favorite model. I ordered it via Amazon and the entire buying experience, the delivery and the wearing was great. I didn't need to use any shoe tread to walk to the mall!"
4,Typical nice Reebok quality,They are comfortable and still not worn out after two years of wearing them outside of work.I am a software enegineer so I can pretty much where whatever I want. I save my reebok's for outside of work though becuase I work in the city and I have to typically walk 5 city blocks to my car. These reeboks have served me well.
1,not what they used to be,"I've bought these sneakers for about fifteen years. I can't find them in local stores any more, so I tried online. The first pair, same size I've always worn, was way too small and narrow. I returned them and tried two sizes bigger and wide. That pair is equally bad, ill-fitting and uncomfortable. I conclude that Reebok is no longer making good shoes."
5,Finally Found 'Em!,My husband has worn Reeboks for years. We moved to the beach and everyone wore Romeos because the salty wet weather is so harsh on shoes. When we moved back recently we could not find any at any store!! I was so frustrated as my husband rarely wants anything specific. I thought about Amazon... of course it worked! I now have a happy hubby!! Thanks Amazon!!!
4,good sandpaper,"This is good sandpaper, lasts longer than cheapo sandpaper. hook and loop system is well made enhancing stickiness to pad, not all sandpapers are like this."
5,Entertaining mystery,"I've enjoyed Stephanie Bond's ""romantic mystery"" series. The characters are believable and the plots are interesting. Good writing and very entertaining."
5,love it,"love it. rent buy. if you like to laugh out loud, giggle. I would recommend this book and her other books"
3,Once I got going,The first half of the book to me was boring with way too much about Angora and her spoiled life.In about 50% of the book the characaters became interesting and seemed to take on life and I really enjoyed the book then but like I said I skimed through the first 50% and wasn't sure I was going to make it to where I got interested but once I did I could not put the book down until I finished it.
5,Great cookbook,"This cookbook is easy to follow and has great suggestions for meals broken down into several categories. The categories include meat, poultry, fish and seafood, veggies, cookies etc. There is at least 150 recipes in this cookbook. It is a really old but for people who are starting out, its a must buy."
5,Better Homes & Gardens Step By Step Cook Book,An all time favorite with me. I refer back to this book often. Have not found a poor recipe in all of it. Lots of helpful techniques & good recipes!
1,Visual Flop,"I am in total agreement with the preceding reviews. As a visual performance, not worth a dime. Aurally, very good. As a video, a total waste of good money."
2,Bizarre Production,"I enjoy conventional productions of opera which feature lavish sets and huge ensembles to complement the vocal, dramatic, and instrumental aspects of the subject. This production by the Opera National de Lyon is an off-the-wall avant garde exercise that is so bizarre that it would have been funded by the National Endowment for the Arts if Europe were the 51st state. It features stark sets, bald women, and a hand full of supernumeraries selected from a nursing home and a mental hospital. If they spent over 50 cents on the set they were robbed. At one point there was a dual between a stage curtain and one of the performers that reminded me of Woody Allen battling the Giant Tit in the movie ""Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask"". I did enjoy the sound track. It was when I opened by eyes that the horror began. But, if this is your cup of tea, bottoms up."
1,Keep your eyes closed.,"I concur completly with the person from Georgia's assesment. I'm sorry I didn't it read in time to save my money. (I guess I'm lucky I wasn't in Lyon.) This fiasco can only be enjoyed from another room, and what makes it even worse is that some of the opera's best music has been left out. Perhaps the production from the Met, or one I once saw with Beverly Sills will one day be made available on DVD. In the meantime, I'll go see Hoffmann in person hoping to erase this memory."
2,Very Basic,"This is a very bland book with little new to offer. The book is broken down into the most basic systems of training. If you like to keep things very simple you might like the book.If you want more scientific information, running pace tables, and more detailed information about the hows and whys of training, I would suggest one of the ""Daniels"" books.As a long time runner this is one of the books I will look through once and put aside. If you are an experienced runner and racer you will probably be wasting your money."
5,Stylish and smart,"These shoes are quite adorable and easy to walk in. The soles are comfortable, and although I did get blisters the first time I wore them, I think they just need to be broken in."
2,Who puts a plant in a USPS box?!,"I'm not surprised this plant is dying. When the postman dropped it, literally, on my doorstep, I had no idea what was in the box. How could I- it was a flat rate priority mail box with no markers to indicate a living plant was in it! When I opened it there was an explosion of styrofoam packing peanuts( did anyone realize that they give off gases which could damage the plant?!) and dirt from this poor unwatered, bare set of olive twigs. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Nicole M.,"I simply love this CD. The music is catchy and so Americana, and reminds me of the songs that my grandparents and my Mom would sign when I was little. Great complication, too!"
4,Hard read but interesting,Very interesting things in this book. It goes through cycles of incredibly hard to read to very understandable. It isn't a long book but it may take you a while to get through.
2,Lower Quality,"These shoes are good looking; but, are of a lower quality that the Aididas and Otomix martial arts sneakers. Very little arch support and the seams are not welded at high quality."
5,martial art shoes,Arrived as featured. They fit perfert. These were for my 15 year old son. He uses them for salsa dancing. Our marital arts teacher recommended these shoes for dancing. Great for spins!
2,QUESTIONABLE DATA,"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't see where this was a scientifically controlled experiment at all. In a cellar? At seances? Moving objects? Ectoplasm? You have got to be kidding. This was just a farce presented in pseudo scientific jargon. As with all these contacts with the dead, nothing of any substance is ever revealed. It is all the same- the loved ones are happy in the afterlife, peaceful, love us, are watching over us, etc. etc. How about some real knowledge- like a cure for cancer? Why can't the ""dead"" ever tell us anything of value?Don't waste your money on this book- I'm sorry I even bought it.Lorrayne"
4,Report Card,"I am very satisfied with the availability & service of the all products I have received. Some of the DVD's were bad, But I realize that that is beyond your control and you made every effort to make good on the problem. All else has been perfect. I applaud you, and highly recommend you to my friends.Robert A. Maloney"
1,Expensive hair grease,"If you want to spend 20 bucks on some hair grease then go ahead, but this did nothing that a dollar jar of hair grease could do. It did not do anything to prevent frizz at all. I have natural hair and this product did nothing for it. It does smell nice- like gardenia flowers."
2,Strong Smell Overpowers Use,"The product does what it's advertised to do, maybe a little bit too greasy for my short, Asian hair, but I just used a little less. However, I could not continue to use it because the smell was sooooo fragrant. I have a pretty sensitive nose to a floral smell (I can't wear perfumes) and this product has an overpowering fragrance. Too bad it's in your hair, so it's right next to your nose, all the time, until you take a shower!"
3,Quality,"The movies are a good value. However, the Papillon movie was of such poor quality (stopped and then skipped constantly) that it was unwatchable."
5,A Must Have!,"This video is simply delightful! My family has enjoyed it immensely. The artwork is stunning and the story is just wonderful. This is definitely a great addition to your collection, and something you'll be watching year-round (not just at Halloween!)"
3,Wow - Who'd a thunk it?,"I found this album's link on a Worst Album Covers site, and upon reading the reviews was shocked to discovered that I know a Playmates song. ""Beep Beep"" was a standard on Dr. Demento's playlist back in the 70's. That sort of says it all."
4,Look for the Unexpected,"The Playmates are, unfortunately, best known for their ""hit"" Beep Beep. They say in Latin ""Non es Disputendum"" or there is no arguing about tastes. Well sorry to say that I find ""Beep Beep"" an insufferably annoying novelty song. So how does a CD featuring a song that I find thoroughly obnoxious earn four stars? That's because if ""Beep Beep"" is everything bad about an era, the Playmates song ""Wait For Me"" is everything that's good about their era. ""Wait For Me"" features lovely vocal harmony and skilled arrangement unheard in today's popular music. Unlike the rediculous ""Beep Beep"" and it's little mash Rambler challenging a Cadillac, ""Wait For Me"" tells an intricate and touching tale. Unlike most story telling songs, ""Wait for Me"" never lets its lyrics interfer with its music. ""Wait For Me"" alone is worth the price of the CD."
3,Mirka Discs,"These discs would wear out much quicker than the Norton discs although the Nortons are more expensive. I have switched to a 5"" Porter Cable low profile unit so I do not use the 6"" discs anymore. They also gum up faster if you hit some gooy spots, the bain of all discs.JJK"
4,like other sand paper,"This sand papaer had no issues, it seemed to work well. I found that slowing down the sander helped with clogging, but the cloging was not a factor of the sand paper."
1,How can I review something that never shipped?,"It's odd that Amazon is asking me to review something that never shipped. They need to do their homework, and have real people look into things, instead of using automated computer systems to do surveys."
5,Much help,"This book is very helpful and offers excellent advice, gives you things to think about that you normally wouldn't have. AND LETS YOU REALIZE your not alone. Gives you hope"
1,"Bottles weren't sealed, like all the other Kerastase Products I've ever purchased.","I don't think this product is an original Kerastase product (maybe the containers were but can't say that about the product itself). The safety/quality seal was missing, so there's no way one can tell this is an original Kerastase product. All the other Kerastase items I've ever purchased (either from Salons or from Target, as some Target stores do carry Kerastase products) came sealed. So I returned the item to Amazon. On my invoice says sold by Angelas Beauty Supply Inc., so I don't know if ordered from a different seller I would encounter the same issue... I decided to get the product from the official Kerastase website instead."
3,Not 3M brand but they work,what more can I say? The don't last as long as 3M does but they work and get the job done.
4,"Lord Brocktree is a good book, but not up to standards","Lord Brocktree is a great book, but it is not has good as other Redwall books. It seems like Brian Jacques rushed through the book. There was little character development before the fighting started. I was hyped up about this book coming out, but it was a slight dissappointment. It starts out with Lord Stonepaw and his aged hares all living on Salamandastron. As always, they smell a war brewing. Then Salamandastron is attacked by a horde led by a wildcat named Ungatt Trunn. Lord Stonepaw is left dead. Then Lord Brocktree comes into play. He has a vision, like all badgers do, telling him to go to Salamadastron. He finds out about the Blue Hordes, and realizes the Bloodwrath won't help him. While he is traveling, he gathers up and army to go fight Ungatt Trunn..."
2,Lord Brocktree by: jake penrod,This book was a okay book but not a great book. I think this because the plot of the story is very good and the setting really paints a good picture for you. But the characters are kind of strange and Brian Jacques doesn't really give good descriptions. Also i feel that the story skips around a lot and making you feel that something is missing. Because of all of these reasons i have to give Lord Brocktree by Brain Jacques a 3 out of 5 stars.
5,One of Brian Jacques Best!,"Lord Brocktree is yet another masterpiece of author Brian Jacques. This tale depicts an adventure of two companions, Brocktree of Brockhall, and Dotti the haremaid. These two warriors set out to defeat Ungatt Trunn and his Blue Hoarde to bring peace back to the mountain of Salamandastron, once again.I thought this book was fantastic. Brian Jacques really puts images into the readers' minds. For example, ""It was situated in broad, beautiful woodland glade, backed by a steep, rocky hill, with a stream bordering one side, fringed with [junk] willow, guilder rose, and osier."" This book was a lot like Martin the Warrior and all the other Redwall books because they all have characters who set out to bring peace to good creatures and to defeat evil. You won't be able to put this book down!"
5,One of the Best Redwall books.,"This book is definitely Brian Jacques's best since Redwall. The adventure, detail, and overall fun are still shining through. I don't want to give away anything, but I will say this: In this book, Lord Brocktree faces perilous, heart-stopping challenges, and with the help of his faithful hares, he tries to make it through. This book takes place before Mossflower, but after The Legend of Luke, his previous novel. Lord Brocktree is a must-read for any Redwall fans. I'd recommend it to everyone."
5,An Indispensable Resouce,"As a researcher period clothing and producer of reproduction clothing, I find this book is a fabulous resource! Not only is there a wide scope of social backgrounds represented here, but the accompanying writings are an additional insight to the people on those pages. A great work!"
4,good pep talk; not useful as a reference guide,"This book is good, but it is not a useful substitute for a more traditional pregnancy guide (I like the week-by-week guides). There are no illustrations (aside from a few photographs of post-partum moms exercising to get back into shape). The book focuses more on how you, as a mom, can cope with all of the changes, rather than focusing on what is going on with the developing baby during pregnancy. It does fill a unique niche in pregnancy books, but I wouldn't rely on it as a primary source of information. It is more useful as a source of emotional support."
5,Happy!,"Just what I wanted. Well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. Now, if I could only figure out what to do with all the ""ghost poo"". Hard to find cobalt blue glasses. Great price. Matches stem glassware at World Market, if you want to add to the set. Great price on Amazon."
5,the look expensive,This don't look like a set of glasses you would get for $15. I bought these thinking I'd use them as back-ups when I ran out of other glasses or had guests. Now I use them as my main set of glasses and I love them. I keep forgetting what a great deal they were since these would look good in any kitchen. They appear to by much fancier than they are. Definately a great buy!
4,Nice glasses,"Some of the other reviews gave me to think they were thin and flimsy, but they're actually fairly thick and quite sturdy. Not quite as thick as, say, a pub glass, but closer to that end of the spectrum than the other. The color is great, too."
3,1st Season is Way better,"I'd give this season an overall rating of ""B-"" Perhaps I had too high of expectations after the novelty factor of Season 1. I won't be buying Season 3."
3,The Controllers' debut album now on CD.,"The anguished ballad ""Somebody's Gotta Win,Somebody's Gotta Lose"" remains a truly poignant--but gorgeous--Soul ballad. By the same token, the sublime ""Heaven Is Only One Step Away"" is a great ballad on which lead singer Reginald McArthur croons smoothly, convincingly and with a lot of class. This was not The Controllers' best album but it's a worthwhile addition for your collection. Originally released in 1977 and produced by Frederick Knight."
5,Baby steps...,"This is a great book for teaching the fundamentals, the baby steps it takes to make real change in your life. It has really helped me to make some changes that I needed to implement. I used this book along with another one my friend recommended calledSuperhero Successto get a better job. I think with what I have learned here Ill be well on my way to starting my own business soon."
3,Many things to learn in a very short space,"My 2 and 1/2 years old daughter loves books with pull-out tabs -- and, believe me, this book has lovely ones. Very colorful, you can explore the ilustrations to teach many things as colors, name of instruments, animals, numbers... But there only four scenes/double pages and I am afraid it is to short."
5,Absolute Must-Have,"Every serious sport-tourer should have Mr. Coyner's book. I've used it to plan a number of trips to the Appalachians. Dale shows you the best of the best, and includes plenty of photos, descriptive text, and resources of each area. His writing is so engaging I enjoy just reading it and daydreaming of future trips !"
2,A real crime.,"I bought this CD over 8 months ago, I loved listening to this fantastic R%B group of the seventies. I have bought several cd's from Amazon but this cd is the absolutely ""worst"" sounding. The sound quality is so bad I would have been better off recording it ""off the radio""...I gave it only ""2 stars"" just because I know its not the groups fault. If you care about sound quality DO NOT BUY..."
3,Overall a pretty good system,"My system (same as here, but honey finish) looks good, but before buying, you should know two things:1. Unless you get really lucky, you are likely to need a fair amount of experience in rough carpentry to make these systems work in your space. We had to do a fair amount of sawing of wood and metal poles. The hanging hardware requires one-sixteenth-inch precision -- not an easy goal in an older home with less-than-square walls. My wife and I are experienced do-it-yourselfers, and needed that experience to come up with a good solution.2. The wood looks good, but it is really soft and splits along the grain easily. I would not recommend this system for a kid's room. During the installation, we had to take care in putting in screws.On the plus side, the finish looks good, and I really like the hanger-bar system, which allows free movement of the clothes past the supports."
3,Pricey for what it is...,"I originally purchased this for a guest room application. I thought it looked beautiful in the pictures and it is just as nice when you get done with the installation. The installation was not that easy, that's why only 3 stars. For something that has been purchased by the masses, you would think that the installation would be smooth, but it's not. In addition, what made the whole installation longer 4.5 hours was that there were errors in the manual. I had to call customer service on it whom were great, but they did admit to the wrong measurements printed of some of the parts. Be careful when spacing out the shelves. When done, the closet organizer looks great, but a little pricey for what it is. For that price, I found semi-custom closets afterwards for almost the same price. Closet tecniks is the name. Might want to check them out."
1,Waste of money don't buy it. It's a piece of junk!,This product is not good. The power cord that connects to the swatter does not make good contact and I bought it brand new. This is how I received it. It's a waste of my money. I don't have time to return it so it's sitting around!
1,This devise does not work,I purchased this more expensive device after my cheaper version fell and broke into pieces. I like it because it definitely looked to be of better quality. But zapping and killing flies are impossible! I still have to zap the first fly!I am very disapointed. The cheaper version worked 100% better.
5,Hooked on some hooks...,"What can you say about wrought iron hooks? Made in the USA! is a good start. I'm planning to make drawer pulls with these to go along with all the other bathroom doodads the Amish make. These will be installed upside down, of course. I guess you would call these ""primitives"". Fine with me. Since there is only one screw hole, it would be best to use a machine screw, and run it all the way through the wood for strength. And a small can of flat black paint will make the screw head disappear. Better than a black marker pen. These hooks will make a very nice addition to a bath or anywhere else you might bathe."
3,"Bad acting,bad games all around","FrankensteinThis is the better of the games.Pretty easy,easy puzzles and easy to follow story.Bad acting from Tim Curry.I bought this games since he was in it.Good for the low priceMummyHorrible,bad story at the end of the game you are left with items you didnt even use,confusing."
2,Out-door wear only!,The shoes are well fitting and good looking. Major problem is ugly black marks from the soles of the shoes left on hardwood/tile floors which are difficult to remove. I would not have purchased these shoes had I known about this problem! The manufacturer should correct this.
2,Didn't work for me.,"I ordered the wide width in these. Have had to use the shoe stretcher many times, and they are still not right. The leather is stiff and uncomfortable.The shoe is very pretty, but I doubt if I wil ever find them comfortable."
2,Not close to the best,"After going through some of the reviews a couple of months ago,i ordered a copy of this book through the net.To my greatest surprise this book is grossly deficient of most obvious facts and harmful to say the least.You cannot use this book for step 3....don't be deceived.I don't know the author and i have no personal problems with him."
3,not so strong medicine,"after reading this book, i feel as though i'm still not ready to take step 3. i think first aid did a better job presenting the cases as well as giving more comprehensive and easy to remember management protocols."
2,PLEASE READ!!!,"this book is awesome as an ultra quick review for STEP 3 for internal medicine residents. however, for someone like me (Psych resident) who forgot most of the rest of medicine, i felt that the information was just too concise without adequate enough of an explanation. i recommend going with the Kaplan review books."
5,It's all in there,It covers all the topics and is the only book with worked out answers to the CCS sections.
2,Misinformation -- caution!,"I began studying this book with the Infectious Disease chapter. I ran into some typos but thought ""so what"" and ploughed on... but soon realized that the author was mixing up several of the bug names (like Cryptosporidium for Cryptococcosis, Herpes Simplex Virus for Human Herpes Virus, and Human Papillomavirus B-19 for Parvovirus B-19). I decided to stop reading and find a better book, if he's having trouble with bug names, he might be mixing up drug names too!Maybe it could be a good book for a final stage review, to help you run through everything in an organized way, but only AFTER you've mastered the material and can pick out any errors yourself (I guess that makes it useless as a review book, huh!).The problem might just be in this chapter, I don't know but, bottom line... I wouldn't risk my Step 3 score or my patients. Nor waste my time double checking the info for correctness."
3,Exhausted,"The book in general has an interesting story line. Though Alexis was quite a character jumping into bed with everyone she met. The sex lacked emotional intensity because she was drawn to everyone and everyone drawn to her, no true emotional attraction. The book was indeed a good read."
4,Not a teach yourself book !!!,"We used this case book in our MBA course for corporate finance. The real cases are exciting. The topics are very broad and ranging from cash budgeting to financial risk management. Most of the cases are supported with good background material like charts and income statements. The book is excellent for class discussions, but not for the ambituous reader who wants to teach himself corporate finance. There are simply no right or wrong answers why there's no solution provided. It's a great book to work with, but deadly boring if you want to read it page by page."
5,2.4 GHz of Mega-coolness,"Reading reviews helped me decide on this model phone that isn't available at 'brick & mortar"" stores.This phone has excellent sound clarity, it's powerful, and it's easy to set up.What I really like about it is this--- Most cordless and cell phones are designed to be so small that you need a microscope and a pair of needle nose pliers! This is a good sized phone, sturdy, and a wide ear piece. You won't regret this purchse, I didn't! :)"
2,Horrible,"I bought this phone about 1 yr ago, it was very expensive and never quite worked right. I can be standing next to the charger and it will tell me it is out of range, it does not allow you to answer calls or anything when it does this. Also when I dial numbers it gets all confused and makes these weird noises and I have to hang up and keep trying until I finally get it to dial correctly. I would not recommend any Panasonic phones after using this one. Right now I am in the market for a new phone and I am probably going with a V-Tech. I know a few people who have these and love them."
3,The outline doesn't match the story.,"It's not a horrible book, but the outline of the book and the actual story are two different things. That's something I would want to know before paying - I got it as a free download, so I didn't really mind."
3,Amazing Story,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed four of Wambaugh's earlier books, I was sure this one would be a page turner; however, it was strictly the story and not the writing that kept my interest. So my feelings are mixed and my rating is lukewarm. Wambaugh tries too hard to depict John Orr as evil, yet without the hard-sell, the reader would come to that conclusion anyway. I finished the book still feeling that there is more on John Orr that could have been included in the book. An additional thought - one reviewer mentions that Wambaugh copies Truman Capote's style of not including photographs of the characters, yet Wambaugh's own picture is on the back. I'd much rather see who I'm reading about."
1,NOT Received This Item,"Up to today's date 04/11/2006, I still have not received this item even though my credit card was charged and the item was ordered three months ago"
4,Not a baseball nut!,"Though I am in the minority baseball league of fans, even I thoroughly enjoyed ""It Happens Every Spring."" I laughed and guffawed all through the film and have purchased a copy for my favorite baseball fan!"
2,Disappointing,Not enough photos to convey an overall feeling of the east meets west look. Many pictures were too item specific. Some of the commentary interesting but not comprehensive enough.
5,Worth reading,"""Chinese America"" is a fabulous book chronicling a misunderstood ethnic group. Today's stereotype is that all Chinese Americans are wealthy overachievers. This book debunks that myth and is very good at explaining how it came about as a result of only professionals being admitted to the U.S. at a certain point and most of those professionals being the creme of the crop from Taiwan. This contrasts with the early immigration which came largely from the Hong Kong region and consisted of rural people so discriminated against that 60 percent of Chinese in New York City in the 1920s were engaged in the hand laundry business, not by choice but because of discrimination.This is not an America-bashing book, not at all. It only retells a complex story that today is not widely understood."
1,Over-hyped,"Repetitious, hard on the joints and more about the guy, than Trudie Styler. Also, the constant reminder to breath was completely irritating. Not my favorite yoga workout, but will be my last w/Trudie Styler."
1,Not so great,"This box is pretty, but that's all it has going for it. There is no picture of the inside, which consists of 1 pull out tray, about 5"" X 5"", with a small side slotted for rings, may hold eight medium size rings. Underneath that is a simple 3 sectioned bottom. Best of all, no way to latch it, even my 30+ year old jewelry box had a latch, so be aware that the clip in front is just a swinging decoration, not functional at all.Pretty, but overpriced and usless if you want to keep things in it, forget about any sort of security, pick it up wrong and you will be picking up your jewelry. Today I discovered that although you get a real person when you call Oriental Furniture (shocking, I know), you get to pick up the tab for shipping the item back, and they insist on insurance AND a tracking number, seems like all you get to do is pay for a big bunch of nothing. Merry Xmas to me!"
3,Broke in the Mail,"The item came quickly, but when I unpacked it one of the plastic handles to a bolt was broken. I think I can replace it from hardware store. And I have managed to use it. So it isn't worth the shipping to return it."
5,Where are our great women leaders?,I thought this book was fantastic. I found Lynn Sherr made Susan B. Anthony come real to me. I loved the speeches and correspondence included in the biography...I would have loved to have met this woman...in her lifelong battle for the vote she went from a social oddball to esteemed matriarch of the cause. I really enjoyed the contrast between her a Mrs. Cady-Stanton. My previous knowledge of Ms. Anthony consisted of the 3 lines included in most high school history books....now I have a profound respect for her work and achievement and found her an inspiration.
4,Parent Manual on Sex terms: A prep for sex education of children.,"This is a must have book for parents of young children. Parents in the monogomus-marriage religious traditions (Jewish, Christian,& Muslim) will value this book as their manual to learn to speak comfortably with each about sex, and, when time indicates it's needed with their children."
5,Sensitive and compelling... a family's growth after tragedy,"My wife introduced me to this wonderful book. With relentless authenticity, RoseMary Cohen describes the circumstances of her daughter's deadly accident and how each family member deals with it differently. Their journey and growth, their suffering and spiritual renewal. She interconnects past stories with the present, and discovers new meanings in them. Liana lives on -- in the faces, actions, emotions of everyone in the family and the many aspects of life they shared with her -- music, art and religion. With great sensitivity, RoseMary Cohen brings us close to human suffering and growth. Highly recommended."
4,"Muy buena tarjeta, a veces se siente algo lenta.","Esta tarjeta realmente es muy buena, no he tenido ning√∫n tipo de problema, aunque hay veces cuando se toman varias fotos consecutivas, que si se siente un poco la lentitud de lectura o cuando la foto va muy cargada de luz.En resumen, es una tarjeta recomendable!"
5,Quintessential reading for any America,"Every American, or anyone that desires Liberty, should read this book. It presents the argument for why historic liberalism should be the route of government."
3,definitly something I need,and it was a freebie....it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
1,naaaa,"easy to deal with, thank you very much for the rapid delivery and help in the getting this to my son"
5,Must have for history buffs,If you are interested in the events that lead up to the American Revolution; you need to pick up this pick to get a perspective from that era.
4,Excellent and thought provoking.,"An essential read for all students of history. Common Sense is the perfect title for these sentiments of reason against monarchy in general and British supremacy over a continent in particular, reminding us that monarchy was originally set in place of man's trust in God."
3,A Short But Important Glimpse Into American History,"Common Sense is an intersting historical book. It was written during the heated national debates that were taking place during the period of time just prior to the Declaration of Independence. Paine puts together a great argument regarding the reasons why the U.S. should separate from England. It also provides an interesting historical context that outlines what the major issues and arguments were at the time for and against separating from Great Britain. The often passionate (but always logical) argument for U.S. independence serves as an excellent snapshot of one of the most important moments in world history. It also provides a great historical argument about why the new form of government that was being designed by the founders was far superior to anything else available at the time. It is hard to refer to this as a book because it is so short, but it is definitely an important historical work that every American should read at least once."
2,OK for a while......,"I bought this game and the add-on pack a long time ago for 10 bucks; I would charge about half that amount now. The game will make you laugh for a while but the joke gets old real fast. The graphics are poor (awful compared to today's standard) and it has some game killing bugs. Download and install any/all the patches before playing. If you are aching for some quick run-and-gunplay and you can find this game for under 10 bucks, buy it; just don't expect too much."
