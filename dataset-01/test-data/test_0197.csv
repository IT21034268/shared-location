3,Untethered from much plot moorings but ....,10 Reasons to like this movie if you watch it with modest expectations:1. Catchy soundtrack.2. Paz Vega is hot3. Unpretentious Morgan Freeman4. The car wash scene5. Live your dreams6. Shopping at Target can be an adventure7. Did I mention Paz Vega is hot?8. The trailer park scene9. The misery of dead end jobs10. Human connections transcend roles or ethnicity.
2,NEJ-Chicago,This has got to be one of the worst film Morgan Freeman has ever made. I am not sure what he or the director was thinking? The best part out of the entire film is the car washing scene. There are three songs in the film that are worth listening to. So the soundtrack is not bad if it is ever made available.
2,Richard and Karen's nostalgia craze,"Apart from the gigantic hit Yesterday Once More,this set pretty much misses the mark. Karen and Richard's attempt to include a nostialgic 50s and 60s medley that nearly occupies one third of the disc indicates that there wasn't substantial material to begin with.Sing,Heather,This Masquerade,Jambalaya etc. all sound average and without any real substance when compared to Yesterday...which by it's self is a true masterpiece and probably their biggest worldwide hit.True Karen's beautiful vocal chords are angelic and clear ,while Richard's prodution skills are outstanding in their own right.Yet this album 's lightweight nature as compared to previous releases would deter any true music buyer."
4,good,"was like new, case was broken probably during shipping but the disc and paper insert were in great condition"
3,Now & Then Begin Again,"For those fans considering purchasing this newly remastered version of 1973's commercial ""Now & Then"" album, allow me to say it IS worth the investment; I already own all of their original albums and have been impressed with the remasters I have purchased. This album, from an audio standpoint, has gotten the best result from the remastering. The former hiss on tracks such as ""I Can't Make Music"" & the sprightly ""Sing"" are thankfully absent; the overall sonic quailty has greatly improved, and for anyone interested in the original studio recording of the classic ""Yesterday Once More"". it's here. For what it's worth, this is not my personal favorite Carpenters album, but for fans, it's just what was needed to keep this ""oldie but goodie"" alive and singing."
4,Entertainment,"Cam'ron is a writer. This is the first movie that hes directed. Most people expected this to be on the level of Paid In Full or even State Property.. but it wasn't. Why spent over a $100,000 to make a movie anyway? With the DV cameras that are out now, you can make a decent movie with under $25,000. This is a perfect example. Most people who dislike ""Killa Season"" don't know what it takes, how long and how much goes into a Holywood movie anyway.I liked it. The movie was nothing but serious comedy. It was fun. This movie is not to be taken seriously. Its just entertainment. Don't get caught up in the production.Get ""Killa Season"" & ""FDTV: Volume One"" DVDs"
2,Not her best Stuff,"I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it. It's nothing new. It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good. The songs are a little more fast paced and ""pop-ish."" Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style. I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead."
4,Worth buying for all of her fans,"Recorded and released before the breakthrough ""Fumbling"" album, Solace provides listeners with ample evidence of her musical strength and songwriting ability--already in full bloom. A lot of the same themes which run through her other albums--love, pain, coping, etc.--appear here, along with the variety of song styles (bluesy, ballads, rollicking pop) we've come to expect from a talented young musician who loves to experiment."
1,Piece of Junk,Avoid this product - After a few months of use I am down to 5 working channels. Some of the connectors have randomly fallen off! You will have several channels go bad on you. Everyday common handling is too much for this fragile snake. Loose connection. They named it Pyle for a reason!
2,Good & Bad,"Let me clarify why I am only giving this 2 stars. The chrome frame and wheels are 5 star. This part is great. The only reason it is being given 2 stars all over, is due to the fact that the material part of this laundry sorter is make of thin cheap material. It rips at the weight of the laundry you put in it. I did not overload it. The pieces that separate the compartments just started to tear. I do not know if you can get a replacement compartment piece, but if you can't then it really is not worth it."
5,serching for years,I had been serching for this album for years. It arrived in perfect condition and I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Must Buy For Pre-Meds!,"I'm a pre-med student at Louisiana Tech, and I purchased this book after it was recommened to me in a medical school information course. It's very informative! It'll give you insight into alot of areas. It also will shine some light on areas you may not have been paying attention too."
3,Not her Best,"I have read this book and it was ok, but for the book to be about regina and justin it focus more on maude and her sex life with johann than with regina, it was just lacking something. i didn't know regina and justin had been together until regina mention it but it was vidid info with maude. so her book was ok but i had to fight to keep reading it."
3,...right,ok I would give it 1 but since the glasses probably strain your eyes like every other virtual whatever. but it is a cool idea so 3*
4,Great receiver,"Not knowing a whole lot about audio features, I bought this based on research, reviews, in-stock, and price. It has thoroughly transformed my families entertaining experience.Although extremely lite on documentation for a novice, nevertheless, I was able to put on ""Kipper the Dog"" for the kids in about an hour.I would have given 5 stars, but for the manual. Otherwise, a quality piece of hardware!"
3,"GOOD SOUND, NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY.","Great sound... but very difficult to set up. I don't even think it supports Dolby 5.1, just 7.1. Not bad, but a lot less user friendly than my last receiver which was a Sony. Also doesn't look quite as nice as the Sony receivers."
4,Solid Euro-Dance & Euro-Pop,"This is not the best Sheena album but it is not the worst. Her vocals are confident but not overbaring. The standout tracks are the two original songs ""Get Here To Me"" & ""You Never Gave Me the Chance."" I love the hit single ""Giving Up, Giving In,"" it is a firece Euro-Dance song. This album is best suited the dance music lovers & Sheena fans."
3,Not That 'Fabulous',"After a seemingly endless respite from the public eye, Sheena Easton resurfaced(at least in Europe)with this album of primarily disco covers. Though the idea was well-intentioned, it would have been so much better had it been more well executed. The song selection is flawless, but unfortunately the production reduces such classics as 'Best Of My Love' and 'Don't Leave Me This Way' to middling Europop fodder, with the few exceptions being a muscular reworking of 'Giving Up, Giving In'and a pretty good take on Gloria Gaynor's classic 'Never Can Say Goodbye'. Also unfortunate is Easton's voice, which has lost much of the nuance and range that marked much of her eighties work, and now just sounds thin and strained. It doesn't help her cause that the production often swallows her whole, with the background vocals sometimes heard over Easton herself. This is a project that will probably appeal only to Easton fans alone, as there are only a few standouts here."
2,"Good piano skills, poor sound quality","Although the musicality of Ms. Hewitt and performance is outstanding, I found the sound very muffled, and ended up returning the CD."
1,"Angela, fell asleep did you?","A middle of the road, non-risky display here from Hewitt. Verging on boring. I can't understand how Penguin could give this recording a good review. There are lots of better stuff to choose from out there. Everything from the hypnotic (Gould), the sublime (Janda), or just very nice (Schiff). OK, better than Martins, but that is about it."
5,Delicious Food,"I am of Bulgarian descent, so this review happens to be slightly biased, however, I find this book to be fantastic! It is full of easy to follow recipies and photographs of nearly all the dishes. If you love to cook and enjoy trying new foods, this is the book for you!"
1,"Meandering, confusing, plain irritating","Supposedly about the history and inner workings of the SS, this book also takes you on a disorienting ride into the world of convoluted sentences and uninspired phraseology. Koehl isn't out to enlighten the reader; rather than telling his story in a clear and methodical fashion, he simply plunges the reader right smack into his ramblings, dropping names and using terms without explanation. This is a book meant for someone who already has significant background knowledge on the subject and who would have no problem immediately understanding terms like ""folkish movement"", ""Kapp Putsch"" and ""the Kahr regime"". Read this book if you enjoy having to go over long sentences again and again and again... I can honestly say this is the worst history of *anything* I've ever read."
4,"Wow, Can't sit still when you hear this CD!!!","If you are looking for a CD that will motivate your workout, this is it!!You will want to walk, dance, or even ride your bike. A great combination of music for just that."
5,Great book for children facing a move.,"Becca leaves her best friend and the ways of the city to live in a less populated area of Maine. Also has a wide of variety of options for unit studies for homeschooling. Ursa Major, 4th of July, Maine and its berries, etc. My children really enjoy reading it over and over."
5,"Got the right item, no problems","I was hesitant to order these because previous reviews said that the vendor kept shipping the wrong product. After I noticed that the product is now shipped by Amazon rather than the vendor, I decided to take a chance.I'm glad I did, because my only other option was to buy much longer USB extensions. Even when you coil them neatly, they are still in the way. All I am trying to do is gain access to the USB ports on the back of my machine so that I can reach them from the front without fumbling. (A hub isn't an option, because some of my devices don't work reliably with hubs.) These little cables are neat and tidy, and they work flawlessly."
1,Does not work! DOA,This extension cable does not work. I have tried it on both of our computers and it is faulty and is not recognized by either computer. Cheap junk.
5,Excellent book,"My teenage brother studies World Wars I and II for pleasure, so I gave him this book. He reads it a lot, as does my pre-teen brother. In fact, he probably reads it as much or more than his other favorite book, a book of studies on World War II battles. Definitely worth getting!"
1,Dangerous rubbish,"These books are dangerous rubbish. They take serious and complex issues and treat them in simplistic, patronising and highly selective terms. They misinform. I would advise parents who care about their children's education to keep their children well away from them."
5,try Goat's milk instead..,"we moved to NY where we could not find fresh Goat's milk., so we ordered the canned milk to see how it would be. After trying it, I will now never return to the fresh. No need to. This is wonderful. I have it on blueberries every morning. It's like desert. A true treat."
5,Great for newborn puppies.,This can be a life saver for your puppies. If you have puppies that need extra milk that the mother dog cannnot give or has too many puppiesto feed them all. Give this milk using a medicine dropper to puppies once every two hours or sooner if needed. This milk is most like the mother'smilk. The puppies will live when given this milk. The puppy milk sold at pet stores are inferior.
3,Goat Milk,"I love Meyenberg's fresh goat milk, but this canned milk has a bit of a goaty taste--still it's ok. Raw goat's milk where the nannies have been separated from the billies tastes better than cow's milk!"
3,Not rugged enough,"I bought this for my son.CON: Immediately the spring grenade launcher (which is really a single shot gun with very low velocity) broke. the metal rod across the gun body broke out the holes in the plastic. The two piece barrel cover where the battery goes when the grenade launcher (which is now broken) is not used, is very hard to get into place while holding the battery in place and pulling back on a spring loaded retainer. Two type of stocks seemed like a good idea but really once one is in place that's whats going to stay there.PRO: The gun seems to be fun to use and the velocity makes it more competitive with the others playing airsoft.I think they tried making too much flexibility in this gun and gave up rigidity.AIRSoft TEK"
2,not for the novice...,"They say ""easy"" but it ain't easy. If you are not well versed in chemistry, don't expect this book to actually teach you anything. WAY over my head."
2,Increased Potency,"I don't plan to read or buy this book. The VOGEL textbook is the best book for lab technique. It is doubtful that Strike's book talks about enantiomers. MDMA exists as right and left handed enantiomers. Probably only one enantiomer has the biological activity. The other enantiomer is probably just inert filler. Thus, optically pure MDMA would be twice as active as the mixture of right and left handed enantiomers. Buy a book on Resolution procedures."
1,interesting,quite interesting. in health class we watched a special that had been on nbc and it was about extasy and strike. so i thought i check this out. noone would want this if they saw the tape of the kids from arizona on extasy and they used strikes book. strikes name is hobart huson or something like that and it's really sad that he's doing this but it evidently does give all the info you need but i wouldn't reccomend it
3,"Be careful, might be the wrong one","I have a 2004 ford focus, and bought this product. It turned out not to connect to my car properly. A little research showed that there were two different stereos installed in the 03 and 04 focus. This was for the base model. If the radio says Blaupunkt on it you will need to add this word to your search to find the correct one.Also, while I still haven't got my radio to work snd may be mistaken, it appears that this product has not been completely assembled. You will need to solder several wires together and tape them up. I do not know if a fully assembled product exists, but if it does it may be worth finding it. I am sure it is more expensive but I suspect a soldering iron costs more than the price difference."
2,A Poor Disguise,"I found this book to be a poorly disguised sermon. Disguised as what, I'm not sure. A novel? No, there was only a vague attempt at one character who changed or morphed throughout the book in order to deliver the stale sermon. There was no plot, the ideas were simplistic and obvious and the author's attempt at creativity only muddled his point (if there was one) and caused confusion. Sadly, I do not recommend this book. If this book were a movie, I would have walked out in the middle and asked for my money back."
3,"good stuff, but far from the best JGB recording","If you want primo Jerry Garcia live, buy Live at the KeyStone vol 1 or vol 2 and hear Jerry G and Merle Saunders in 1973 in their prime. I loved going to see Jerry's band in many incarnations throughout the 1980s, but his voice and his energy gradually decreased into the 1990s. Years of touring took their toll. His voice on much of this JGB release is very weak and rough compared to his earlier years, and these band members are no match for the great JG Bands of the mid 1970s. Really, skip this one and buy the KeyStone recordings. There is no comparison."
4,For Want of A Ladder,"Clues so subtle, Charlie Moon needs a rap on the shins to follow them, but with all of his cleverness a woman to share his life eludes him. Lila McTeague, FBI agent leaves him behind for other pastures.This series is like a comfortable shoe where as you read you remember other stories in the series.I miss the almost lyrical quality of previous books, but Aunt Daisy continues to surprise as she maneuvers her overgrown nephew to do her bidding. Daisy Perika is a character you wish you could meet in person. One of a kind, who keeps the reader coming back for the next installment.THE WITCH'S TONGUE, is not the best of Doss, but a good read despite its flaws.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,Surprisingly Laid Back G-Funk; A Great Album,"Big Syke's first album is a striking contrast to what you would expect from a member from Tupac's (R.I.P.) Thug Life Crew. One would expect that it would be hard knock gangsta rap. However, Syke takes a 180 turn and throws out conscientious minded rhymes. In songs like ""Why"", ""Wasted Talent"" (f/ Mac Mall),he seems more concerned with educating youth about the reality of life and politics. He seems intent on helping young people think about the decisions they make in life. He gets reminiscent of his youth in ""Good Timez."" Overall, the album is sonically good. He puts in laid back g-funk beats, a few of which border on R&B and Soul. He does get a little gangsta in songs like ""Highdollaz"" with harder rhymes over old school Roger and Zapp like beats laced with the whiny keyboard synth in the hooks. It is a total lowrider song. He seems a little more upbeat and positive than his fellow Thug Life alumni!"
4,Great Solo Album,"This is probably the best Solo Album by and Outlaw. Syke hooks it up with Above the Law,Mac Mall and Mopreme. The Album is all around good and you should pick it up if your a fan of sykes flow and a Outlaw fan. Since this Album Syke has signed to Rap-A-Lot Records with Napoleon,Kastro, Edi and Young Noble and he will be dropping another album late 99-early 2000."
2,Saul from Samo,"I chose to read this book because I love soccer, but it ended up dissapointing me. Never have I read a book where there are meetings and arguments in every page. The excess amount of meetings that Bose describes made me feel like I too was sitting in the meeting trying to stay awake. The greed that this club had to become the best helped them do so. Their were key moves by club officials that lead to this story of success. The only thing exciting about this book were the arguments thinking that at any time some club officials would literally fight each other in the meetings. If your interested in business and strategy you would probably enjoy it, if you play soccer and try to read this book after practice I guarantee you will have trouble trying to stay awake."
4,Goat's Good Gift,This is a very good gift for the price. It has very generous full size amounts. The smell of the product is acquired but it is a soft baby smell. The washcloth is strong yet soft. The beeny goat that's included is a great addition and baby's will love it. I am thoroughly enjoying this purchase
3,Solid biography about Chamberlain's later life but...,"Joshua Chamberlain's post-Civil-War life never reached the heights of his military exploits. John Pullen has done an excellent job researching and writing about Chamberlain after the Civil War, but, like Chamberlain's civilian life, it's not as gripping as his Civil War experiences. For die-hard Chamberlain fans and those interested in Maine's and Bowdoin's history, it's worth reading, but if it's excitement you want, read Killer Angels."
2,maybe the production is the problem,"This is merely bland, easy-listening country music that I think has been rendered so by boring production. They sound like they could be a good live act with some real fire, especially if all of the vocals were given equal volume (the harmonies complement the lead, but that's all they do, they're just in the background). There's just something about what I'd have to guess to be the production that really flattens and dulls all of the songs on this album, and prevents justice from being done to the potential talent. Something else odd about this album is that the songs are all grouped according to what key they're in, which makes it less interesting as well. That said, I do think this record has its value and makes for good easy-listening or background music. My chosen tracks are ""Goodbye Says It All"" and ""I Sure Can Smell the Rain"", with the former being the only really unique song on the record."
3,A story that needed to be told,"This is a well told story, with quality production values.The only issue I had with the entire show was the Director dressing up in WW2 GI attire and ""Playing Soldier"" on camera.I'm sure his efforts helped him get a better feel for the story he was trying to tell, but he seemed out of place, uncomfortably out of place, in this show.Other than that, it was a good production"
2,that's not german!,"I'm sorry, but the actors trying to speak German sounded like someone from a grade school trying to parrot the language tape. Surely, the producers could have hired someone on-line to ad-lib for a small fee. Lost all credibility in the first 5 minutes"
3,Solid Mistery,"He has done better in the past, I felt like he rushed this through because the strong continuity he has had in past books did not seam to be here in this one. The story had some good aspects for example there was no shortage of interesting characters to get into (how many killers can there be in DC?). The one thing that I did like is the speed of the book; I think it is the short chapters just make me feel good, like I am really accomplishing something. Not a bad book, just not his top game."
2,"BAD B.C I CANT HEAR AL, A LEAD GUITARIST","It is a decent introduction into moe.'s style, yet a huge portion of their sound is missing!! I CANT HEAR AL! A major guitarist in moe. is nearly entirely inaudible, leading to a huge misout in their overall sound. with chuck and al always playing off eachother flawlessly, you cant hear anything but chuck, even when only al is playing its very hard to hear. overall i still like the dvd and moe.rons should/could get it, cept al is really missed out in it"
1,disappointed,"We were very disappointed when our travel bar did not arrive before our trip. We paid $30 for ""expedited shipping"", to have it take 5 days from order date."
1,This is awful.,"This is a terrible movie. It won't satisfy those looking for a gay film, nor someone who wants to watch a horror film. Only the most depraved sadomasochist could enjoy something like this--and they would have to put up with a ludicrous plot, senseless torture and, above all, the worst acting I've seen in a horror film, which is saying a lot."
2,atrocious soundtrack,"Too bad the soundtrack is so muffled to be almost unintelligible.Too bad, good story."
5,The Voice!,"This album establishes that Whitney does indeed have the greatest voice ever! Powerful and beautiful ballads with that glorius voice, driving dance tunes that beg you to get up and boogie! What a set of pipes!"
3,Whiny Houston?,"OK, somebody has to say it. Whitney murdered Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" The arrangement is so lame, and it just sounds ridiculous especially when Whitney sings like a cat in heat or something. I wish somebody would tell Whitney, Mariah, and Michael B. that sometimes less is more. Look , the lady has a great set of pipes, but TURN IT DOWN LADY! Listen to your cousin Dionne Warwick and learn some restraint! We are not impressed by screaming and other ""vocal gymnastics."""
4,Great soundtrack album,Nice to hear the S.Y.S.T.E.M. on this and Whitney blows the roof off with her soaring voice...songs match the movie which is nice...
3,ipod swim belt,"This is pretty slick, but the place for the ipod is a bit small. I see mine has a little tear already. It could have a better velcro holder deal. It comes undone a bit in the water. It does not create any drag while swimming."
3,So-so product,"I bought the lotion and this body wash bu Goat's Milk. But felt conservative to say ""great"". No big difference to other products of this price range and doubt how much milk in it--Fresh goat's milk is the 10th ingredients on its label."
3,Dreams of My Father,"A worthy read, I've heard that this is one of the two books of Gallmann that Bill Ayers used to add some African content when writing Barack Obama's ""biography"" ""Dreams of my Father"". (African Nights was the other one) NOT plagiarized mind you, but just mined it for some local color of Kenya which neither Obama nor Ayers had a great deal of familiarity with. Interesting."
3,Good substitute for cow's milk protein allergy,"Half a teaspoon is good for coffee or tea; use instead of cow's milk for making pancakes and waffles, etc. Travels easily. If the entire packet is not used in one week, keep it in the freezer as it will go off."
2,Not hard at all,I did not buy my dvds from amazon. I purchased them separately. One from Walmart and another from a garage sale. I have been doing tae bo since it first came out. These dvds are a disappointment. They are not in the least bit challangeing. I barely broke a sweat. I now only do these dvds when Ihave had a bad night and don't have the energy for a more intense workout come morning. Something is better than nothing.
1,Couldn't get past page 52,"I had hoped to give this book to my 11-year old daughter to use as a jumping-off point for many of the subjects we would be studying in our home school. I decided to review it myself first and was surprised to find on page 52 that Mr. Hirsch credits Harriet Beecher Stowe instead of Julia Ward Howe with writing ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" Instead of continuing through the book with a red pencil, I decided to throw it away and start somewhere else."
5,A showcase of one of the most talented musicians ever.,"There is something for everyone in this set. As a fan from the ""Mandy"" days, it's great to have so many of his greatest songs in one collection. One of the best Christmas presents I ever received. His music really speaks to me."
2,Not Worth the Money,"When I discarded my vinyl collection, I lost such gems as Last Duet. It was omitted from Ultimate Collection. Keep your money and try and find a used copy of the Barry album released in 1980."
4,Addicting fun,This is a casual game that gamers and non-gamers alike will find themselves playing way too much.
1,Wrong item,I was sent a wrong item. I received something totally different that I didn't order. I had to return it.
1,A truely horribly book!,"i really didnt like this book. it was long, boring, and far fetched. i doubt every1 in a school can turn against a person cuz he didnt sell some boxes of chocolates. although it had a good theme -kill or be killed- it still stunk!"
4,"Good, depressing, but the ending?","I read about this book online somewhere, and decided to check it out of the local library. It only took a couple of days to read, and in spite of a few flaws, I did enjoy it quite a bit. First of all, I never read this when I was in school (perhaps because I attended Catholic schools?), in fact I'd never heard of it until a few weeks ago. All I can say is that I'm 43 now, and I found it to be rather chilling in spots! Some of the main characters are as evil as you will ever find, which is okay with me (I tend to enjoy ""dark"" stuff). The main problem I had was with the ending, which left several things unresolved. That said, I would recommend this book for adults and mature teens who want something different. It is especially meaningful when you are or have attended private Parochial schools (yep, I had to sell chocolate in my youth!). Yes it's kind of depressing, but it's still engrossing, a quick read and very good. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel!"
1,I did not like the book,"I think the book was the least interesting, really boring, and too darn long."
4,Good depiction of private school teens,Cormier does a great job of depicting the teen society of private school. The Various rivalries and corruption give the book a superb plotline. Recomended to all interested in fictional drama based on catholic school teens.
2,Not a very good book.,"Personnaly, I hated the chocolate war. It was very obscenm and profane for starters. It was also not particuarly interesting and overall not a book. Moreover, it has a terrible ending ad teaches terrible moral lessons I would reccomend to someone to read. It;s not the worst book I've ver read, but it's up there.It's about a kid name Jerry Renault who is just trying to fit in and wants to play on the football team. everything was fine iuntill he got an assaignment from the Vigils, a secret society of students, who for all intents and purposes, run the school. The vigils tell jerry not to sell chocolates at the annual sale for 10 days, when Jerry still doesn't sell chocolates, he risks life and limb for the sole purpose of being different."
1,I Put it Down,"My book review website: [...]In only the first chapter and a half, there is numerous cursing, a reference to masturbation, and a character outright tells another that he does not believe in Jesus because He was ""just a popular figure who caught people's eye"" more or less. I put it down after that.Research on the book uncovered that, because of the novel's language, the concept of a high school's secret society using extreme violence to enforce the cultural norms of the school, and the protagonist's sexual ponderings, it has been the frequent target of censors and appears at number three on the American Library Association's list of the ""Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books in 2000-2009."""
2,This book makes absolutely no sense,"I remember reading this book when I was in seventh grade, and I had to stop myself from falling asleep (maybe because we were forced to LISTEN to it on audio tape). Anyway, I tried reading it again, and it's just too bizarre for words. The only part I vaguely understood was that there were some chocolates being fund-raised at school for a baseball game, I think. But from there things got crazy, because it seemed like new ""storylines"" and new characters were popping up on every page. Also, this is supposed to be a children's book, but the ""s"" word is thrown around an awful lot. If you can understand any part of this book, give yourself a pat on the back.Anthony Rupert"
1,I'd give zero stars if I could,"Hands down this was the worst book I have ever read. All the characters are detestible, the plot is cynical, the language filthy, the behavior of the characters repulsive. Do yourself a favor and do not waste a precious minute of your life on this trash."
2,Umm....presents stark but exaggerated views on life!,"We had to analyse this book for english. This book, without a deep review, appears so boring. And it is. Even with the 3000 essays (!) we had to write on it, it did not seem any better. I believe it was a pointless book that really dwelled upon the harsh yet trivial things in life. A HORRIBLE READ"
4,This is a great book!,"Robert Comier is a magnifiscent writer. He beautifully tells the story of teenage boys attending a private, catholic, highschool. But, the story goes much deeper than that, and there are wonderful surprises at each turn of the page. You'll have your head in the book the entire day!"
3,Chocolate War is bittersweet,This book has some decent ideas and themes that are relevant to teens and adults but I found the plot to be a bit of a stretch. The character of Jerry I thought was portrayed with sensitivity and realism. Cormier gets into his head and voices his fear and insecurity with precision. It's worth reading because it raises important questions that teens and adults should always be pondering. Where is your life going? Why are you here? What are you going to do? What should you fight for?
4,I just love this book,"No matter how many of my birthdays have passed since I first read this book, I still love it. How can you not fall in love with determined Jerry and the cold but intriguing Archie? I was eager to find out what would happen next throughout the whole book.If you like this one, I suggest you try other Robert Cormier books because their all just as good as the last. Oh yes, and if you read this one, you MUST read ""Beyond the Chocolate War"" too. How can you not want to know what happens after?"
2,Wish the School could Teach Lesson with High Moral Standard,"I read this book 1st. I do not want my daughter reading the Mature Content definitely not PG-13.. Yes it's for high school.. most of the parents are saying. There are themes in this book that we do not allow in the movies that she sees, and do not understand why school and district FILLED WITH EDUCATORS, maybe not with children..., could not teach whatever lesson that they are trying to convey without the vulgarities within this book. Someone decided that the ""classics"" were no longer valuable I gather.My purchase from amazon was great, as the book was for 1 cent and shipping was 3.99. At least I do not feel robbed AND disappointed. We love the option of used books particularly when it's for a school assignment."
4,"A dark, complex tale of power told in an American highschool","Robert Cormier was born in the United States during the Great Depression. His first major writing piece published was `The Chocolate War' in 1978. Soon after he went on to write I am the Cheese and After the First Death yet it was only until 1985 that he began to write again with The Bumblebee Flies Anyway which was followed by Beyond the Chocolate War, his short story collection Eight Plus One in 1988, and his 1990 masterpiece Fade.The Chocolate Wars is a story of a high school, mafia-type gang called the Vigils who maintain control through humiliation. When a Chocolate Sale is organised by the teachers to raise money, the Vigils are called in to `encourage' the students to participate. All of the students fall in line but one, and it is his story that the narrative tells.The Chocolate War is a complex, dark narrative that illustrates the capacity for individuals to bootstrap themselves to power through the manipulation of others."
2,Ups and downs of the Chocolate War for teens.,"The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier, somewhat describes the high school scene today. The books theme mainly revolves around peer pressure and individuality. The story isn't exactly realistic but it does bring up many interesting points. Many of these points deal with things we teenagers have to deal with on a day to day basis. From masturbation to fighting. It seems to deal with it all, but in a very awkward manner. Robert Cormier brings too many people into the book all at once which really doesn't help you understand too much about the character introduced, the setting, or the plot at the time. The dialogue of actual teens in this book isn't very masterful but in his own way it seems he is trying to understand us as teens and our way of thinking. All in all it isn't a bad book but if you really want to spend time wandering and guessing this book is for you."
4,The Good Guy Finishes Last,"The Chocolate War is a novel written by Robert Cormier. This particular book is a perfect example oh how words can keep you on the edge of your seat. The author does a remarkable job of keeping the reader involved as each chapter flows into the next. The main reason readers enjoy this novel is because of the story line. There are many different events all happening at the same time throughout the novel and in the end each event ties together to create a rather ironic ending. Like most movies and books as well the good guy is the hero at the end; however, The Chocolate War has a rather sad ending, disappointing many readers like myself. The protagonist in the novel gives young adult readers a more realistic view on life which makes this novel four stars in my opinion."
2,Chocolate War,"This book is very different from any book I've ever read.This book teaches important life lessons. Also, this book has a very good theme. But, the way Cormier writes is very confusing because he changes the point of view every chapter. This takes away from the book because half the time you're reading you don't know whose eyes you are seeing through. Except for the very end this book is very boring , and almost nothing interesting happens until the last 3 chapters. This is one of those books that you will put down, and never want to start reading again. This book is also not suitable for younger readers because it has some graphic images, and swearing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you love Robert Cormier, and read every one of his books. In conclusion, this book teaches wonderful lessons about life and has a good theme, but the book is so boring and confusing that even the great theme can't make this book great."
3,The Chocolate War Review,"The Chocolate War was not a realistic book at all. First, how could there be a group as powerful as The Vigils in high school? Second, it is not very realistic that a school would order 15,000 boxes of chocolates and try to make the students sell every last box. Last, it is not realistic that teachers would let a student physically abuse another student and get away with it. In conclusion, the Chocolate War was not a realistic book, which is why I gave it two stars."
4,The creepiness in the story does not feel dated.,This story is more frightening than anything written by Stephen King. It is a staple of high school reading and has been for decades.
3,amazingly realistic,"im 14 yrs old and in yr 9. For literature we read robert cormier's ""the chocolate war"" and i thought it was very well written from a kids perspective.I was very pleased with the ending of the story as it wasnt the steriotypical ""they all lived happily ever after"" ending.It was also a rather unusual story line and not at all what i expected. because mr.cormier uses occasional strong language it makes the book seem more realistic and thereby holding the readers interest. , because lets face it- what teenage kid doesnt occassionally use strong language?! Also this book shows how strong peer pressure can be and how far kids are willing to go just to fit in.i suggest this book to any kid who loves reading realsitic books and any adult who is just a big kid at heart!"
4,A Classic Tale of Good &Evil is found in The Chocalate War,"The Chocolate War marks Robert Cormier's entrance into the young adult area of literature. This novel is a coming of age story about a young boy, Jerry Renault, and his mission to stop the tyranny of Archie Costello, the leader of a secret society, the Vigils. His crusade begins as a small act of disobedience when he refuses to sell the chocolates in the annual school wide chocolate sale. It ends when the Vigils start a chain of events that will inevitably lead to Jerry's or their own societies destruction."
2,Not a page turner.,This book was not a page turner at all. The whole book was based on a kid not selling chocolates. Page after page was just about a kid not selling chocolates and worrying about being beat up. The book was okay at sometimes and horrible at others. One of the better parts is when Jerry got into a fight with Janza and his gang. The horrible parts were when the gang was planning to do something or when the school and the gang were thinking up ways to sell all of the chocolates. There were to many different people and to many points of view. It was almost confusing at sometimes. A small matter that came up in the story could drag on page through page until your finally tired of reading about it.
3,Nice story!!,"The Chocolate War story make me laugh, made me think, and also made me mad. This story unlocks many secrets about public and private schools.Many of the issues that were revealed in The Chocolate War are in our daily school life. Problems between students and other students, and teachers with student. This story is not just revealing real life situations but also gives out a cool message to all students who are being influenced by certain groups of people in school. Dont let your self get bullied around, if you dont want to do something your being force to do just do what Jerry did and stand up for what you want. Even if you have to confront the whole school tooo."
4,"awesome- I mean, pretty good, for some part of it","ok, I was reading some of the reviews up there and I can't quite believe there are people rating it an 1. Even though then I discovered there IS something missing in the book, the whole conduct is still beautiful. What was missing is a more convincing ending, is what I think. Well, I haven't found out what ""Beyond the Chocolate War"" is about, just gonna check it out after finishing this, and to find if there is a satisfactory ending"
3,One of the books that Young Adults should read.,"After your young adult reads the typical young adult novels like Lord of the Flies, and you want to encourage them to keep reading, try this one.Usually rated in the top 20 of Young Adult fiction (usually around 13-16), The Chocolate War is more specific to the Junior High crowd. It is a bit deeper than some other Young Adult novels, but still teaches lessons that can be of valuable use to the developing teenager."
4,practical and useful,"Practical and useful book. A good refresher for someone who knows, and a good guide for someone who is starting."
3,"C9 Magazine Review - Lolita Storm ""GFSU""","Lolita Storm is fronted by three, that's three, female singers. Spex, Nhung Napalm & Romy Medina propel poppy punk vocals over scratchy, noisy beats, fast drums, and punk guitars. Yet, I can't seem to find the person given credit for playing the guitars in the linear notes. With songs entitled ""You Make Me High (When You Go Down Low)"", ""Hot Lips - Wet Pants"", "" (I wanna) Meat Injection"", and ""He's So Bad I Luv Him"", the lyrics are often tongue in cheek expressions of abuse, boys, and sex. Let's not forget the song about stimulants, ""I Luv Speed""! A lot of the songs on this album oddly sound a bit like one another, but different at the same time. After all, it is fast girly punk with synths and an attitude. It actually has some rhythm, no real noise here. Hopefully this won't be the only CD these three females and their keyboardist Jimmy Too-Bad put out. It will be interesting to see if they expound their sound any in the future. ...."
2,Dissapointed.,"I just got this album last week and it is definitely not on the same level as their first album. The whole tone of this album is almost ""new age-y"", very weak stuff. It has none of the underlying dub funkyness of their debut. In fact, this seems to go out of it's way to be much more soft and commercial. My wife likes this one, but she also has 10,000 Maniacs CDs in her car, so take that recommendation as you will."
3,Too many typos,I enjoyed the story line and would have liked it better if I didn't have to decipher words on every other page. I read 2 to 3 books a week and I can honestly say that this book (kindle version) had more mistakes then any book I've ever read before. I'm reluctant to read anything else by this author because of this.
2,if you like to hear the same thoughts over and over again...this book is for you,I dont even know where to start with this book..it was so boring..and they kept repeating the same thoughts over and over again..and I dont want to get into the editing...wow...please keep your money... I wish someone would have given me that advice.
4,Added tracks,I had this on cassette and wanted it on CD...it came in the same case so I thought it was the same as the cassette...but much to my surprise...it has some added tracks..very nice...but some are duplicated...it is a bit redundant.
2,"""The White Room/Justified And Ancient"" Major let down.","I had eagerly awaited the two pack cd and man was I let down. I even saw Blue Man group 3 times before the soundtrack came out and I even heard about KLF. ""Last Train to Trancentral"" is KLF's only good song, aside from that I found the rest cliched and old. Major let down...guess I am going to have to sample music more BEFORE I buy. (Insert argument PRO-MP3 here. =) )"
5,"We came a long time ago, 992 but you did not know.","I have been a KLF fan ever since I heard the song 3 A.M. Eternal. If you really like really soft and hard songs, then get this CD. Also the CD that comes with it is really great. I myself am glad to own a little KLF history.I really recommend this CD to anyone. Especially other KLF fans. I also own The White Room - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Which was only given out to the KLF fan club."
3,it was a trip out film,"i watched this film recently&was cracking up in certain spots. it was cool how the Cast wasn't predictable&this film had a freshness about it. certain things wear it down in spots,but on a whole it was cool for some laughs."
2,More commedy for men,"Has anyone noticed that while women have advanced in dramas they are probably worse off than ever in commedies? Little more than playthings or opponents for men in virtually EVERY modern commedy, from Harold and Kumar to 40 Year Old Virgin, Beerfest, etc. I think women were stronger characters and got better lines in the old screwball commedies of the 1930s!!!"
4,Super movie - great movie to watch while getting drunk.,"I was laughing all throughout the movie. Not only that, the movie is quite intelligent too, the stupid cops, typical Kwikie mart owner, typical asian are all quite funny. Unlike other high budget BS movies that advertise the heck out of a movie and then fall awfully short, this movie delivers more than enough bang for the buck. I think everyone needs more brainless movies such as this one."
3,Extremely underwhelming...,"Well; when it first came out, it was the funniest buddy movie i've seen. Fast forward to this blu-ray edition, supposedly extreme unrated; Harold & Kumar have become stale. Btw, why the 'extreme unrated' tag, because of the 'topless' scenes? please...Don't get me wrong, the feature film looked good visually. It just that the shock/comedic value have gone down. Meant to be seen only once, not for repeated viewings.The special features: there's nothing impressive there. All done in 'glorious' 480p resolution.Final ThoughtsRent it, borrow it. Never own it, unless this brand of comedy is right in your alley..."
5,No `Scary Movie' or `American Pie' beats this!!!,"This film is going down with the classics! Not only is the movie one of the funniest I've seen, but deals with a social issue that plagues all our lives. If you hang out with a lady named maryjane, you HAVE to invite her over before you watch this flick! If you like `South Park' type humour, get ready to pee yourself! Monty Python, Cheech & Chong, and THIS!!!"
4,"Odd premise, but entertaining film.","If you live within driving distance of a White Castle (or Krystal), and can watch this movie WITHOUT having to get in the car and go there to have dinner (or lunch, or a midnight snack) when it's over... well, you're a stronger man than I am.Yes, it's silly. Sometimes dumb. Sometimes downright stupid. But it's very, very entertaining, and that's what a movie is supposed to be. The point of the film is that, sometimes, when life is kicking us in the teeth, we just have to grin and continue on towards a goal. Harold & Kumar's goal? A meal at White Castle. And while several (and I mean *several*) obstacles try to prevent them from reaching that goal, they rarely lose focus.If only we all had that degree of intensity... and if only the ""prize"" we're all looking for was as satisfying as a White Castle when you're really craving them...Definitely worth a rental if you've never seen it."
4,"Hey, I liked it!","This is the best party movie I've seen in quite awhile. It has all the main ingredients you look for in a party movie; plenty of laughs, gratuitous nudity & zany good times.Our heroes find themselves craving White Castle burgers after getting stoned. It does not sound like too big a deal to get to the burger joint, but their trip turns into one filled with so many quaint twists & turns that it turns into a miniature version ofRoad Trip (Unrated Edition)!The funniest part of the movie was their run-in with a creepy tow-truck driver, aptly named ""Freakshow."" While some of it was a bit predictable, it was humorous nonetheless. The cameo by Neil Patrick Harris (AKA: Doogie Howser) was cute as well.While I'm never big on movies that aggrandize getting high, I'm willing to make an exception in this case. If you're into the party movie genre @ all, this one is worth a look!"
1,Worst Ever,Finally saw this piece of garbage. Worst thing I have ever seen.How can anyone give this a good rating other than tasteless Americans?
1,Pure Garbage!!!,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is horrible. I love stoner movies, but they try way to hard to be funny in this movie. The writing is trash and the acting is horrible as well. Those Ernest movies are funnier than this crap. If you want to see a funny movie, check out 40 Year old Virgin instead. I should beat my friends ass for recommending this bile. Schindler's List was funnier than this crap!!!"
1,profoundly stupid and crude,"I'm amazed to see all the positive reviews of this movie. There are a few funny scenes, but generally this is a stupid and crude movie that makes the Austin Powers series look sophisticated. The ethnic politics of this movie are also pretty appalling, with the protagonists encountering a series of white characters who were either: evil racists, stupid, or both (and always over-sexed!).The clincher is how when H & K repeatedly encounter some poor soul being terrorized by the aforementioned evil white folk, they simply turn tail and run, without even considering offering any assistance. Uggh."
1,"OMG, stupid crap!!","This is the stupidest, sh*ttiest piece of crap I have ever watched. It goes right beside Sorority Boys. The only funny thing was the weed fantasy and the racist cops. But the movie... omg, what a huge waste of my time. It's horrible. SO BAD. How the hell can anyone enjoy this movie? It's a dude movie, and it SUCKS. The humour is obvious, dry, and the plot is just stupid. Don't waste your money on this. Heck, don't waste your time. It's MUY STUPIDO."
4,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels do not star in this movie, AMAZON!!!","First of all, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels do no star in this movie, AMAZON!!! Get your heads out of your Patookus's and take some notes! You might learn something!!!This movie stars two very funny men, of middle and Eastern Asian Descent, and provides a look at our two main men, as they head out on their pursuit to score some White Castle burgers! Mmmm, mmmm. Can't you just taste them?They meet lots of colorful characters, and you know this is just a 90 minute excuse to watch them chase after pot all over New Jersey.I loved this movie, and laughed hard at the gross and super funny humor.I would recommend it.MC White said: Check it out!!!"
5,Great Pan!,I purchased one for myself and have since purchased two more for a wedding gift and a birthday gift. This gift will last forever and can be handed down for generations to come! I absolutely love mine!
4,Nice Basic Grill Pan,"I've grilled turkey burgers, hamburgers, chicken breast, fish filets and veggies with this thing and I've been pretty much universally impressed. The more delicate fish varieties will stick but then that's true with a real grill as well. Firm fish like salmon, swordfish, tuna, etc. are fine. It holds heat tremendously well and gives delicious results for indoor grilling. (If only it came with applewood smoke flavor.)It's a real cooks tool and it takes a litte technique to use it effectively. You have to use the proper temperature, follow the cleaning instructions (no soap), and maintain the ""seasoning"". If you're looking for non-stick, easy clean up or dishwasher safe, it's not for you. Also, it's cast iron, so it will give your forearms a workout.But if you want to grill indoors I don't think you can beat old fashioned cast iron and you certainly can't beat the price."
1,I don't get it!,"I bought this pan based on all the good reviews and I just don't get it. It doesn't cook well, drys out the food, is difficult to clean, weighs a ton and requires you to dry it and 'oil' it after each use. What a waste! I would have given it 0 stars if I could have."
3,Does the job but plate is not non-stick,Learned the hard way that I have to spray with non stick cooking spray before use. I bought this after having a george foreman grill and I think I may go back to my foreman grill. Thick pieces of meat also take longer to cook too vs. the foreman grill.
5,Couldn't live without it..,"After owning this for a few months, I honestly don't know how we lived without it. This is easily the most used thing in our house, it's absolutely great for grilled chicken and steak.. tastes like it just came off of a grill! Very easily maintained and relatively easy to clean. We love it."
3,grill pan,"I love lodge cookware but I am somewhat disappointed in this pan. Whatever food or oils that fall down in the groves really smoke up the kitchen. The clean up isn't as easy as my other lodge cast iron because of the groves, when the water hits them it sprays everywhere so turn your faucet on easy or have the water go through or over your hand first."
5,This works great,"We've had this machine for over a month now and used it 4 times. I have to say that the spaghetti, pizza dough, macaroni and fettucini we've made so far have been superb.The instructions for measuring the flour tell you to measure by weight (pounds) not by volume (cups) but they give simple conversion instructions. So far I've just put in several cups of flour and the right number of eggs and the dough has turned out perfect each time. They do provide a number of recipes for different types of dough such as spinach or tomato pasta. We will get to those eventually.I have to say that fresh pasta is far better than any store bought dry version and we love this machine.It has been very solid and dependable so far, I don't see any areas where it might fail easily.Enjoy!"
4,Solid Construction,"I have had the Ron Popiel pasta maker in the past. This is a replacement for that maker which finaly failed after ten years. This pasta maker is much beter constructed. It feels hardy and sits with a comfortable weight on the counter top. Made pasta in the same manner. It took a little practice to get the consistancy right, so a little patience is needed."
2,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed this author's first two books, but I was extremely disappointed with this one.I could see no logical explanation for why Carrie was involving herself with this investigation. It had nothing to do with her, and very little to do with anyone she was associated with -- certainly not enough to warrant the extent of her involvement. And even more difficult to comprehend was her annoyance with others, especially her boyfriend and best friend, when they tried to get her to back off something that had nothing to do with her and kept putting her in danger.I hope the next book in the series is better."
3,Strong Start to Fun Formula,"The main character, Lt. Col. Evan Burton, is an engaging military man close to retirement with some moral issues but truly out to do good. As a bit of a fixer of difficult problems he finds himself on the hunt for a kidnapped daughter of an American Senator. The action takes places in a former Soviet republic which provides a rich environment for the range of factions and interests that Peters includes in his plot. What holds the reader's interest is the potentially plausible kidnapping at the core of the story. A good travel or beach read that begins very well but soon becomes your standard thriller."
3,"Cliched potboiler, but very good","I hate potboilers, and I hate cliches, so that's why I give it three stars. But this book is so over the top in both categories that it's actually entertaining. The author tries hard to pack as many cliches in one page as possible--and the effect is a surprisingly good read.Having visited some of the places in the book, I can say that the book is not accurate in daily life depictions, but it is realistic and plausible, which gives it depth.Peters is definitely better than Clancy."
2,Random & Incomplete mess,"My first exposure to the EARLY Moody Blues was the awful-sounding US LP ""GO NOW"". I'm bemoaning the ""electronic stereo"" remix, not the music! At least that was (more or less) a legitimate ""album"" (in the way US butcher-versions of great UK albums were in the 60's). THIS has no point in existing-- a seemingly random sampling of 45 and album tracks thrown together to make a quick buck (and I've seen a number of these over the years).Let me be clear-- I've grown to LOVE the Denny Laine incarnation of The Moodies-- and to share my enthusiasm, I highly recommend anyone track down a copy of the complete version of THE MAGNIFICENT MOODIES (the one with all the 45 and LP sides-- 25 songs in all)."
2,"Poker Diary, not a Novel","This is effectively a collection of sections from Brandon's diary (perhaps poker diary). Each 'Chapter' starts with the date and location. The average chapter is 6 pages. This does make it easy to pause at logical places should you need to do something else during the 90 minutes it might take you to read it.After a quick Internet search, it turns out the publisher is a self-publishing site. This really shows. No major house would have let this get to press. It does read well, but would be better in a collection of short works than as a stand alone 'novel'."
4,A nice addition to any occult library.,This book is entertaining. It focuses on herbs and spices that can be readily found in your spice cabinet or at the grocery store. Also it is full of small tid bits of information about Wicca.
4,A Great Primer,"This is a great book to have on hand if you cast a lot of spells. It's loaded wtih wonderful information and includes acceptable substitutes. As a beginning caster, I'm a little overwhelmed, but I can see where this is going to be one of my most consulted tomes."
5,Absolutely Necessary,"As a Never-Before-In-Any-Fashion weaver, I ordered a rigid heddle loom and this book. Without it, I would not have known which side was up on my new loom. With it, I was quickly and simply able to take all the steps necessary to be up and weaving in a matter of a couple of hours. If you're new to weaving, Buy it!"
4,Rigid Heddle Weaving,"Excellent rendered illustrations of process & equipment; good color photgraphs of projects and easy to follow directions. Since my only loom is rigid heddle -- it is great to not have to ""interpret"" directions & techniques for the other kind. Good book for beginners to intermediates."
1,Poorly made,"I ordered this item looking for an sorted rolling laundry basket. Within a week of using the product, the dividers between each bag ripped. The entire bag is made of a very a cheap material that seems to be a type of paper. I continued to use the basket for roughly nine months until one of the metal legs actually snapped off. This product is worth maybe $5-10 instead of the 30 something I paid for it."
5,Definitely Great!,"Schubert's Symphony No. 9 is written on such a grand scale and full of such bravado that you cannot help but be inspired to conquer a small country while listening to it. Sir Charles Mackerras brings dedicated restraint into line with optimum tempo and the result is momentous. You will wish you were conducting yourself! The orchestra is an hybrid mix of modern instruments and natural horns. The effect is splendid on the ear and actually balances quite well. The Scherzo is thunderous and the Finale will stampede from your speakers. The ""Unfinished"" symphony is plaintive and actually seems quite remorseful. It is lovingly rendered here just after the 9th. So you will have to wipe the big smile off your face and reach for your hankie. Telarc captures all the nuances in shining clarity. You will not want to miss this recording!"
5,Mystery and Horses- What Could Be Better?,"After being awaken in the middle of the night, Alec finds out that someone was trying to kill his beloved horse. But why? When Abu Ishak appears and claims that the Black is his horse the next day, Alec is deeply suspicious. Alec, after Abu Ishak greets the Black, realizes that Abu is the Black's real owner. Soon the Black is back in Arabia, and Alec is lonely. He hatches a plan to see the Black, and try to get him back. Alec, Henry, and a weathly horse breeder depart to Arabia to find the Black and Abu Ishak. In the desert, not all is as it seems. Who was that infant found alone in the desert? Who stole the Black? Mystery and intrigue can be found between the pages."
3,Did not live up to the hype of the other reviews.,"Good, but not that good. Daughter, who is 2 1/2, enjoyed watching the whole movie, but has not asked to see it again, which can be interpreted as a marginal thumbs down from her.Music is good, but I didn't find myself humming any tunes afterwards. Animation is reminiscent of retro styles, which is nostalgic and kind of nice."
5,Heavenly spice!,"We love it! Grains of Paradise has a spicy, peppery flavor. Shipping was fast and the price of the bulk bag was reasonable."
5,PPLLLLEEEASSSEEEE Bring it back,Practically grew up on this stuff as a kid and loved it as a young adult. I was totally bummed when they discontinued this product and hope they bring it back some day...
3,Just OK,"Another fine example of great musicians who can't write a great song. This CD has Jeff Healey searching for a new direction and ending up somewhere between rock and dare I say it rap. Even the stronger songs seem to have elements that seem out of place. A good example would be ""Leave the light on"". Probably the strongest song on the CD. It is marred by distorted guitars from start to finish. This is a long way from the blues rock that Jeff was known for. If that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere"
4,Another Brown Triumph,"Dale Brown serves up another ""what-if"" techno thriller. This time China and the Philippines go to war, dragging the US into the action' As Usual, it's up to Patrick McLanahan to develop a plan to stop the aggression. Another excellent thriller by Brown"
1,Not the original recordings!,"The CD is titled ""18 Greatest Hits"" but they're not the original recordings. They're re-done and they are HORRIBLE. Nothing against the genius of Duane Eddy, but if a giant evil eyeball comes from outer space and destroys all of his recordings except this one, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,"Ok, not great","I purchased this item upon finding out I was pregnant and thought the taste would be GREAT based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the taste was just OK. Tasted kind of fake...but since it is healthy, it is a fairly good alternative to some of the other junk food we are tempted to eat. So overall, decent for taste good for nutrition."
5,very tasty!,"these bars are perfect for throwing in your purse for when you are out and about and that 'i have to eat NOW' hunger hits you. they are really tasty, and have all the vitamins you need for the day. i tried other pregnancy bars and found them kind of gross tasting, so this one was a nice surprise."
4,Dr Peter brought AIDS out into reality from thousands,The short segments the Dr Peter Jepson-Young did for the CBC evening news in Vancouver in the early 90's made the disease of AIDS real for thousands of people in the suburbs.This book expands on that and follows the life of the disease through one reluctant spokesperson
3,"Great Music, Poor Sound","The choice of pieces is exceptional but the sound quality of the recording is pretty awful. It sounds like the microphone was covered with a thick blanket. The guitar Russell plays is a Dammann but the quality of recording is so poor it might as well be a cigar box. Shame, and you know what, it's just as bad on the other CD I have of his: ""Baroque Guitar."" I like your playing and taste but David, please get a better engineer."
1,Did not fit,The mats did not fit. I called the company and asked for a RA and they said they would mail it to me. That was 3 weeks ago and now they won't answer the phone at all. I am assuming I am just out the money for the mats. I would NOT use this company again!
4,Picture book,"Having gone through the Blizzard of 78 I was pleased there was mention that about two weeks before the Blizzard there was a substantial snow storm with plenty of snow still on the ground. This made the actual Blizzard much worse that it may otherwise have been. The book is interesting and shows pictures from many areas, along the coast, on Rt. 128 (now part is I95) and other places. The coast was extensively eroded and D Troop 5th Cav. had it's tracks on the seashore rescuing people. My son joined them seven years later."
3,Not overly embracing this book,"I have recently become a KEW fan since receiving a copy of The Elusive Flame for Christmas. This is not one of her best, but it is acceptable. The character development (of the heroine especially) is not as deep as I have come to expect from a KEW novel. It just seems that Russia is not a locale that she excels in describing either...not in the same class as her Great Britain or US set books."
5,a wonderful book,"I have read all of Mrs. Woodiwiss's books and I loved them. Forever in your embrace is one of the best, It has mystery and a lot of love sceens like all of her books do. She explains the sceens so realisticly its like you can see exackly what is going on. You can picture what the charicters look like and what they are wearing. So if you arnt a real big mushy romance fan you will probably like this book. The caracters are very well thought up and believable. She Is one of the best authors that I have ever read. If you get a chance read the others."
1,blah blah blah,when i first read this book it was a couple of years ago. how can this be copyrighted this year? anyway this book was so fakey. how boring the only reason how i got through it was because i had detention in high school. that was it but damn it sure made me sleep plenty of times.
4,A very interesting trancendal album,"As a music lover, I considered this album to be very smooth and easy listening."
3,Low budget action movie fun,"I saw the reviews for this movie on another DVD and figured what the heck, I'd try it out. I wasn't expecting anything major. What I got was a mediocre movie with some fun comedic scenes and outdated-but-realistic-looking special effects. The same special effects team that did Independence day worked on this film. They used many of the same techniques which include miniatures. It's impressive that these special effects still hold their own, even though the norm nowadays is to use CGI. I think this movie is probably going to be one of the last of a dying breed, using miniatures and slow motion/high speed captures. The movie keeps pace pretty well, but the bad acting and low budget make this a mediocre movie to watch. I did burst out laughing a few times, which is worth the rental I think. 3 stars."
2,not great for toasting,"Not the toaster for you if you mainly want to toast bread. It takes forever and doesn't really brown it. Holds more toast, but doesn't necessarily toast the second row. Bakes well though...."
5,Great Album,"I was introduced to Fairweather by one of the guys at Equal Vison records and like wise I was also instantly addicted, there singer sings with such passion and energy and the songs are so powerfully charged. You will be hearing alot about thing band in the future, I know that I can't wait to see them live in concert. ..."
1,No good for DSL,"I own the older model EE400-R and it has worked like a charm, but my internet connection is broadband modem and I never tested it vs DSL.On the basis of my experience with the EE400-R, I recommended the newer EE420-R to a friend who is a DSL bunny. Bad news! As reported in the previous review by E.A.P., the thing would not accept the DSL password and so could not connect to the ISP - end of story.Could be that the EE420-R would still work with broadband modem connections - I dunno. But for DSLers - stay away!"
1,Come on...what kind of title is this?,"[...]Go out and buy the original ""I Spit On Your Grave"" and watch a film that will shake you up...below your belt buckle! Have your freaky girlfriend watch it with you...while she will ""act"" like she thinks its too violent or upsetting...check her panties to get the real truth what she thinks of it...Skip this cheap movie and have your freaky girl piss on you instead!"
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is easily Sarah's greatest album. While surfacing seems to fall into a pattern of sound alike sappy love songs, the lyrics on Fumbling are far more meaningful, with a brooding, almost dark edge to them, but still remaining ever hopeful. Musically the album is superb as well, with brilliant production and a subtle layered sound that takes more than one listen to fully appreciate. If you're a fan, you MUST own this album. If not, it may be the one to change your mind."
5,Pure Sarah,"This is the best Sarah CD available. From ""Possession"" to ""Fumbling.."" everything is pure Sarah. Every single word on this CD touches one's soul. I played my cassette version of this until it could be played no more. This CD is the most powerful and emotional CD that I own and is Sarah's best."
3,Not worthy of all the hype,"Reading the numerous reviews written in these pages would lead one to believe this is a life changing album - it isn't. Or that Ms. Mclachlan has a voice beyond compare - she doesn't. The music is definitely worth a liten and in the right mood is certainly charming and atmospheric. However I wish people would live with an album for a while before awarding five stars, then I wouldn't have to waste so much money!!"
4,Ethereal,"For someone who is heavily into techno/ electronica/alternative/metal music, I just had to put my two cents in here. Sarah's voice is beautiful, her lyrics are moving, her piano playing is intense. This is definitely an album everyone should own. ""Fear"" literally sends shivers down my spine each and every time I hear it. Do your entire body a favor...go out, buy this ablum, grab a glass of wine, light some candles, slide into bathtub and lose yourself in her voice. (""company"" optional, but highly recommended!)"
5,This CD is Awesome,"the cd really moves u, especially ""hold on"" and ""fumbling towards ecstasy."" i would recommend it to anyone"
5,Oh Yeah..She is the Queen of soul,You will love this CD. I can't stop plaing it and never tire oh hearing this sweet voice.This is how music use to be....and I love it!
1,Be careful...,"I bought this cd just for Aretha's version of 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' which is listed as track 16 in the Amazon listing. The cd I received only has 15 tracks and does not include 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. Amazon's listing is deceptive at best and should be corrected. Apparantly you have to buy the import version of this cd to get track 16, which would have been nice to know before I wasted time and money buying this one. Guess I'll have to start all over."
2,"A beloved, but not scholarly, writer","Unger's commentary came highly recommended, but when I began reading it, I was pretty disappointed.For example, in the book, at the point of commentary for Job 38:2, Unger says that the word ""my"" is present in that verse, and that it should be read as God referring to his own counsel. That is wrong. ""My"" is not at all in the Hebrew.I could have let that go, since it is a common, but wrong, view.But then I saw Unger use the word ""Jehovah"" for God's sacred name, which is an error dating from the Reformation. The vowel signs are for the name ""Adonai"", signaling the scroll reader to speak ""Adonai"" in place of the sacred name for God. It was mistakenly translated as ""Jehovah"" when the vowels were mistakenly combined with those 4 consonants.Any beginning Hebrew student learns about this. So, I suggest that students wanting in-depth study in The Old Testment look elsewhere."
4,The best of Parson's post-Project work,"Don't let the 3 star raters fool you, this album has every musical element from the Project days plus it has an EDGE to it, both musically and vocally. Woolfson ran out of consistent creative ideas and it showed in virtually all of the Projects 80s work. This album is better than just about anything short of the first three Project albums and Freudiana. However, it's not a ""one listen will blow you away"" type of album. Give it time and repeated playings. Andrew Powell is given particular showcasing here--it's worth it."
5,Should we expect anything less.,"This guy engineered The Beatles ""Abbey Road"" and Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Should we expect anything less from Alan? He is a perfectionist in all of his music period. I have all of his albums and ALL of them stand out. No one can put out instrumentals like Alan can."
3,Not all bad.,"This book smacks of a work done by someone who had a thesis and then did everything he could to prove it, rather than letting the research bring him to a conclusion.Fortunately, I did get the feeling that the basic history of Killpatrick was decent and reasonably fair-minded. At the end of each chapter, however, Martin adds his commentaty about how the foregoing information shows that Kilpatrick was a horrible leader, womanizer, thief, etc. At one point, Martin suggests that the attempt on Jefferson Davis' life introduced the idea of assination, even to the point of possibly leading to Lincoln's murder. Right.Killpatrick's womanizing, thievery, etc comes out, for sure, but were his casualities really highter than comparable commanders? That's not clear. He won some battles and lost others--like most Civil War leaders."
5,Used by my Music instructor,"My music instructor assign home study using this book, great tool for studing and practicing skills."
3,Our recommended age: 18 months - 4 years,"I am afraid, this toy is not suitable for ages more than 8 months. It is very small indeed.I request the manufacturer to look into this and come up with an appropriate age recommendation.The best part of the toy is...Comes with electronic sound and wheels. The nose moves to breathe while it is singing."
2,"Solid game for Indy fans, but ends undramatically.","Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford.And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran, swung, punched and kicked your way through level after level, trap after trap.Good if you're an Indiana Jones fan, but others should either rent or stay away altogether."
4,Very good game but a few flaws,"This game is very fun to play. Great story, good graphics, and very good sound.This game is addictive, its a preety long game but you might finish it a week. You get to go to places like Celyon, Hong kong and Istanbul. The fighting controls are awsome. You get weapons like the revolver, shotgun, machine gun, and the crossbow. The A.I. is good, which means the enemies won't just stand there there, they will hide behind things and follow you. You will also need to use stelth in some parts of the game (which is cool). There are a good verity of levels too. Now for some of the flaws. A mechete takes about 10 hits to kill somebody. If you shoot sombody in the head they'll still fight you.You will also find yourself using too many bullets on one guy.And one other thing: how do you crounch?The bottem line is this game sounds a lot better than ""Tomb Raider AOD"". So if you like adventure games definetly get this one."
5,"My favorite ""career book""","This book just amazes me. So simple, humble, yet she knows just what to write for those following their hearts. I highly recommend get her newsletters, as they too are full of wisdom."
1,Now anyone can sing better than Ashlee,"Thats right boys and girls, Ashlee Simpson lets everyone know that anyone can make it in the music industry. Do you need talent? Absolutely NOT.The only thing that is important is that you have a famous sister. You can lip sing on SNL and get booed off stage at the Orange Bowl. But you know what? That is okay because you can suck at singing as long as your sister is famous.Practice lip singing like Ashlee with this Karaoke CD. Unfortunately large crowd too boo you off stage will need to be purchased separately."
5,It works,These brakes stop K2 skates faster than any other break available. Of course there are no other choices of brake (other than color) for your K2 late model skates so get this one. It works.
4,OK!,"I think I have had enough of My Morning Jacket. They are good but, the releases become a bit repetitious after a time."
2,Worked for 6 months,Bought this item in November of 2007 and it lasted until April 2008. When it worked it was quiet and did the job well. I just wish it would have lasted longer...
1,Product does not keep automatic watches going,"Perhaps I am not using the product correctly. There are no instructions enclosed within the product. Although I have placed both of my automatic watches within the winder and the winder does rotate for an hour and then rests for 3 hours, both of my watches still need to be wound when I want to use them. I do not understand why the product does not keep the my automatic watches going. So the product works but it doesn't keep my watches wound."
1,Dont buy it,Horrible motor.. My product broke within first 1 week.. then i got a replacement and that broke after another week. Just stops winding.
2,Spectacular bid,This book was a bit formulaic and sophomoric. I was looking for more in depth information and a warmer story about a beloved athlete.
2,Not All I Wanted !!!!!!!,"Sorry to disagree with other reviewers, but this was weak. Victoria was a very cold unlikeable character. I would read 100 pages and still feel that all I knew was that Victoria did not like her own parents, loved the Yorks, was career driven, had no time for dating and thought that Daryn was her best friend. It was soooo repetitive.I found the book to be the same thing over and over. If Mama York said, ""Victoria, child"" one more time--- Yikes! I found it funny that she did not speak to her own children that way. I really don't mean to be negative, but I really did force myself to finish the book.Also the book had probably one hundred typographical and grammatical errors that a good editor should have corrected. This also distracted from the flow of the book."
5,This book is divine,"At the benginning of the book I found myself already liking Ariana.Then out of the blue she was kidnapped. .While capitive she had to stay in very poor living quaters,with only her Bible to comforrt her.The bosse's son starts taking care of her if you could call it that.Then the daring escape to Araiana's reltives.But what will become of her?Will she ever wear the gown of spanish lace? I found this book Exciting.I have read it over and over again and I love it more every time.I would recommened it to anyone and everyone"
4,"Colorful, functional, and carefree","The classically-inspired design is complementary to many kinds of dinnerware and table settings. I have contemporary, square white plates and it's a nice look. The ruby color has strong pink tones and goes well with floral napkins and fresh roses. The placemats are extremely easy-care, just sponge clean and stains disappear. One minus: if you leave them on the table in bright sunlight, they fade. I've had mine out for about a month, and corners of the mat are definitely lighter where the sun hits."
1,Walking the dog,"Try whistling this was a great solo effort full of great songs. One nil's songs are OK at first, but by the final whistle, I'm just left feeling cold and thinking what was that all about? However if your a dog lover you might get somethin' out of this album as some of the songs mention dogs and several of them were apparently inspired by walks with the dog. I must say I personally prefer non-dog inspired music."
5,"If you hated ""Try whistling this"".....","....like I did, ""One Nil"" will restore your faith in Neil Finn's songwriting. Whereas ""TWT"" was poorly produced with a third-rate band, ""1-0"" has great upbeat songs beautifully produced by Tchad Blake with 1st class musicians (Mitchell Froom, Sheryl Crow, Wendy Melvoin, Jim Keltner, et al). The album has a beautiful, lush sound to it. Here's a tip: try listening to the CD with your headphones on -- you'll be in for a treat not found since ""Temple of Low Men""."
5,Ace Of Base's Best CD,"Ace of Base's debut CD ""The Sign"" is their best album to date and remains one of my favorite CDs of all time. The pop hits ""The Sign"", ""Don't Turn Around"", and ""All That She Wants"" are here, but that doesn't mean the rest of the album is trash.Unlike many artists who seem that only their hits are the only thing worthwhile off an album, ""The Sign"" keeps the beat grooving in songs like ""Happy Nation"", ""Waiting For Magic"", and ""Living in Danger"", and ""Dancer in a Daydream"". Personally I think all the songs are downright awesome except ""Young and Proud"".Impressed with the first, I bought their second album, ""The Bridge"", and was thoroughly unimpressed. If you liked these early hits from Ace of Base, I can guarentee that you'll like the vibes of ""The Sign"". A real essential recording in a modern pop collection."
3,"The glory days of ""Club"" music are over","Ace of Base came out with this album at the height of the club music boom. It just so happens that I was in my club phase and was tuned into 103.5 KTU almost all the time (anyone from Jersey or NYC knows about this station (: I have to say that this isnt a bad album, and even though they were another flash in the pan band, they did manage to put out some pretty solid ""pop club"" tunes on this one. Music has changed so much for the worse in this genere, that today we dont even get to hear music Ace of Base, but are stuck with duds like Christina Agularia, Britney Spears, and Gwen Stafani, whos music which isnt up to par with the great club songs from the mid and late 1990's. This one will bring back memories of driving down to the Jersey Shore, with our windows partly opened, and our bass turned all the way up. This one is more fun then anything serious, but its kinda a reminder of the good ole days.."
3,Euro-fluff,"Remember that Hanson song, ""Mmm-bop""? Everyone was humming it, but no one admitted to iliking it. Reminds me a lot of this debut from Ace of Base. Songs like ""The Sign"" were enormously catchy, but this disc is really uneven, as you might expect from a new european dance band. As a whole, Ace of Base has more talent than most of the imports we have seen in recent years (I am thinking of Aqua here), but the songs here tend to be shallow and fluffy. This is a good disc to pick up used."
4,Gotta love it!,"I adore Ace of Base. I loved them 15 years ago, and I still love them. The beats are strong, solid, funky, the vocals are cool and very 90's. I don't listen to it as much as I should, with all the other music calling to me all the dang time, but when I listen, it's one that I can put on and enjoy the ENTIRE thing!"
5,The whole family will enjoy this one!,"I received this CD as a gift when my daughter was born. Not only has she enjoyed the calming, gentle tunes, but her older brother and sister have also been soothed to sleep many a night by these lullabies. They are also a welcome relief to a stressful day for any parent!"
2,Drinking Tea is a Guilty Pleasure,"Unlike a good cup of tea, this book does not satisfy. Rather than being a history of tea and tea drinking it is more a vehicle for the McFarlanes to purge their guilt of being a family who greatly benefited by their former attachment to the tea growing industry. A discussion of the condition of the tea worker over time is valid enough but this work is ultimately an exercise at excessive hand- wringing. For those looking for a more comprehensive history of tea, especially commentary on the origins of various blends and regional tastes, one must look elsewhere."
2,"TOO SMALL FOR AVERAGE ""BIG GUY""","I'm 6' and 225 lbs and this thing was like a collar around my neck and did not fit like an adult PFD. It is sold ""as one size fits all"" but there is no way I could wear it with just a shirt on, let alone with jacket and / or rainsuit. I unpacked it, tried it on, and packed it back up and returned it with no hassle."
2,Maybe there is a better selection....,"I bought two of these at one time, but only rated one...now several months later, I can honestly say that my children do not like this videos. They just don't capture their attention. They love learning sign language and about new things, but these videos are extremely overpriced and not an engaging learning experience. I would still like to find a good sign-language teaching video for them; this series is not it."
2,Not quite what I expected!,I wasn't that satisfied with the product. Didn't seem to hold my children's interest very well. I would recommend Happy Signs. My children seemed to love that movie!
2,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I received this video as a baby gift. I was disappointed because there are only 18 signs on it! I was also disappointed that there are only two songs, one during the opening and one during the credits. I really liked the beautiful mommy, kids signing, and the two songs, but wanted more signs. I also felt there was too much time spent on each sign."
5,A must have for children with speech delays!,"Our son Jack just turned 3 and has been diagnosed with Apraxia, a speech delay. Thanks to Rachel Coleman (we own them all!) he is able to communicate through sign language and just loves the music and the upbeat themes. Excellent purchase for toddlers!"
5,Not just for kids...,"I am a young adult who has used ""Signing Time"" as a springboard in an attempt to get back into practice with sign language. It has proved invaluable to me! Rachel, Alex, and Leah make it easy and fun to remember the signs with catchy music and plenty of child and adult models for each sign. Signing Time! is a useful and fun tool allowing kids and adults to learn this beautiful, visual language."
5,Amazingly Interesting!,"Signing Time is a great video for anyone wanting to show their children how easy learning to sign can be! I am a presenter/Teacher for hearing parents of hearing children, using Joseph Garcia's Sigh with your Baby program in my classes and workshops. This video is one that I show my parents as an additional video to purchase. The signs are very clear which makes it easy to understand and it appeals to not only children, but to the adults that will watch it with their children. The music is great and will hold your child's attention through the entire tape! This is a MUST HAVE tape for your children!"
1,Work on it,I couldn't get into this play because the audio is so bad with an echo or something that I couldn't understand what was being said. I think somebody forgot to preview the DVD quality before distribution.
4,A marvelous look at the U.S. Senate,"JFK has written an indepth look at the glory days of the U.S. Senate: the 1800s. With beautiful language and a thorough understanding of the material about which he is writing, Kennedy biographs a group of men who stood up for themselves and their beliefs (emancipation, etc.) in the Senate against the majority of men and popular thinking. Although sometimes it goes a little slow, this Pulitzer Prize winning work is necessary for any American history buff."
4,A must buy,"I have never been a big fan of JFK and I have found that many things remotely associated with him to be unnecessarily praised because he is a Kennedy, American royalty. However, I found the book ""a must buy"" for the two objectives JFK wanted to demonstrate:- The courage of individuals at key points in their careers who risked and usually lost everything for what they believed in- That politicians are forced in their careers to balance of the interests of their parties, their voters, their state, the nation, and their conscience. It is very hard to serve so many masters.The book increased my understanding of the difficulty of the political process."
4,"One of JFK's best, along with Why England Slept","Profiles in Courage is one of authorJohn Fitzgerald's best alltime. Thechapter slone on Robert Taft, A Rep.Senator from Ohio is a classic allby itself although JFK terminologyon a couple minor points is not ex-actly correct. JFK was a very welleducated man and would have beenone of the great Presidents of ournation's history. His writings provethat!"
2,"It was very well-written, but I found it quite boring.","Parts of the book are quite interesting, but the majority of the book was quite boring. I admire JFK because he himself had a lot of courage and didn't brag about it. JFK was in the Navy (1943) during WWII and his boat (PT-109) was sunk by the Japanese. The whole crew got off, but there was one man that was injured, so JFK took him off the boat and into the water. he put a rope from the man's lifejacket in his mouth and pulled him to shore. He was in the water for hours!!! While doing this he aggrivated an old back injury and got Malaria! Now that is what I call courage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very infomative but it put me to sleep.,"This book has a lot of facts and information but is very boring to read. I am not kidding when I say that it put me to sleep, it really did. As a ninth grade student, I would not recommend this book. However, if you like history (and boring books) this book is for you. If I were a history teacher I probably wouldn't make my students read it."
1,PRETTY EXPENSIVE!!,"I'm sure that it's every bit as good as a Roomba but, holy cow, look at that price!Electrolux is a great name. We had them install a central vac in our last home (at great expense) because we thought it (the name) would be a good investment at resale -- it was. I don't believe, however that this item has much resale potential any more than a Roomba does, but the Roomba only cost us $199.00 for a refurbished unit (4230) which gives no trouble."
4,Beyond the call of duty,I watched this movies back 1992 on a tape but this DVd missed the startingof the movies when they was testing the sergeant in the military campfor shooting stimulated targets before sending him for the call of dutythat part was nice but transfering and old VHS with the whole ORIGINALMOVIE INTO DVD IS NOT EASY BECAUSE I REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE WAS VERYLONG. Good movie I rated it four stars for some missing part
4,Timeless love story,"Rich girl meets poor guy. They fall in love. Rich girl's parents nix the romance. They're still in love. She becomes engaged to another man. They're still in love. And so it goes...as Allie and Noah go through a lifetime of barriers to an unlikely, but never-ending love story. The acting is good, the scenery is beautiful, and all in all this is a great tear-jerker. In his autobiography/travelogue, Three Weeks With My Brother, Nicholas Sparks writes that this book is based on his grandparents' love story. That makes this movie even more poignant. Watch this movie, but don't forget the Kleenex box."
3,pretty good considering the genre,"I was forced to watch this with my wife and daughter. They loved every minute of it. Although the storyline is nothing new, it was a pretty good movie - and that is coming from a grown man who generally dislikes romantic movies."
2,saccharine storytelling,"Other than the scenes of the beautiful South Carolina low country, and James Garner's touching depiction of The Reader, this movie is pure sap. The South Carolina depicted is all so so pretty, and so so white - the Negro servant caricatures were offensive.Young Allie was all surface and no substance - ""oh, boo hoo! Two attractive and intelligent men want me, but I don't paint anymore!"" Young Noah comes off a bit better, with his quiet mastery of facial expression. Sam Shepherd and Joan Allen play their parts well, but their talent was wasted on such one-dimensional characters.However Your Mileage May Vary. There was enough sobbing and sniffling going on around me, that obviously many people were touched by the movie. I just wasn't one of them. A little vinegar in this sugar would have been more than welcome."
4,An enjoyable movie,I have a special collection of VCR tapes and wanted to update to DVD's. This was my first DVD purchase and I couldn't be happier. The audio and picture were both great. I enjoy purchasing my DVD's online especially when there is a sale.
1,Hours that I'll never get back,"After so much hype and all of the special DVD releases, I have been wanting to watch this movie for a long, long time. But to say that I was bitterly bored and disappointed once I finally managed to see it, would be a massive understatement. This movie was boring, predictable and long and at the end of it, all I could think about was that I had wasted $8 of my hard earned money on this rubbish, but more importantly, those were 2 hours that I'll never ever get back again.I was looking for a little bit of entertainment on a quiet Winter's Sunday, I wasn't looking for a sleeping aid. Though if you are having trouble getting a good nights sleep, then this movie may solve all of your problems.There are a lot of bad movies out there, but I think I hate this one just a little bit more than any other."
3,A little long,"The Notebook is a cute movie, but it drags on in some parts and is as slow as an old person. I much prefered A Walk to Remember. The Notebook loses some of it's magic as you're forced to look at your watch and realize that 120 minutes seem longer than it really is."
4,"Fiction, but very romantic and touching","It is a very moving movie, that covers different key aspects of life (love, loyalty, feelings vs the-right-thing-to-do, etc). I could not stop crying at the end. But remember this is a film so DO NOT compare your love life to it. Just enjoy it."
1,"An awful, boring love story!","I watched this movie several times, trying to figure out what was so good about this movie. I discovered what was good about The Notebook was NOTHING. This movie did not make me think about love or anything. I found it very pathetic. Why everyone likes it, I'm not sure. However, there was a couple of things I liked about The Notebook... the previews and the credits (which confirmed it was finally over!). If you want to see a real love story go see The Titanic, go see Brokeback Mountain, even go see Superstar! But not The Notebook. You will be bored out of your mind! Guaranteed!"
5,Cried my eyes out,"Resisted watching this for years, thought it would be sappy but really enjoyed the actors and the story very much. Watch it if you believe in love that lasts and prevails. AAAA+++++++++++++"
5,CLASSIC LOVE STORY,"Simply, a must see. This is such a classic love story that everyone will love no matter what age. GET IT"
5,Fabulous,Wow...this is a GREAT romance. The best I've ever seen. I want to see it over and over. It made me long for a love like the one protrayed. I will buy the DVD the day that it's released. This is a must see for everyone.
3,Chick Movie - Buy it for your wife if you want time to yourself,"This is my wifes favorite movie. I think it sucks! This movie is one of the only things that shuts her up, I guess its not all that bad."
5,Not your average love story,What I liked about this movie is that it was original. It's not your typical corny sappy love story. It has depth that I feel many people can relate to. We all know what it's like to be young and in love and this makes for a great love story. Take a chance. It's worth watching.
5,this is what true love is all about!,"I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I WATCHED THIS MOVIE 3 TIMES. I COUDN'T HELP BUT CRY IN SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE.THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST LOVE STORIES I HAVE SEEN.PLEASE DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND BUY/RENT WHATEVER YOU PREFER BUT PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED! THE MOVIE IS GREAT"
5,Made me want to be a better person,"When I read a book and/or see a movie that inspires me, I want to become a better person. Everyone should be so lucky to have a person love them just a fraction of the time this story tells. This is the best love story I have ever seen. It inspired me to look at my life and remind myself how very lucky I am, as well."
3,"Good movie, not good timing",I ordered this movie as a Christmas present because the price was good. The gift didn't come in until after Christmas so I ended up having to buy another one and just kept this one for myself when it came in. I love this movie though....
3,not bad,"I like this product. I was everything i expected it to be, and i would recommend it for anyone looking for something like this"
2,not up to the hype,"Sorry to have to bring things down to reality, but the only reason I gave this two stars were for the main male leads being played by James Garner (one of my favorites) and the upcoming Ryan Gosling.The film may have ""garnered"" more stars if they hadn't blown the more-interesting subplot half way through the movie by introducing the children. If they would have held that to almost the end, the impact of their relationship would had maximum romantic and emotional impact. Instead, it became more of a case study of Alzheimer's disease."
3,Really not bad.,"I just watched The Notebook. My date loved it (her third time to see it). I thought it was pretty good. Fairly predictable and a bit sappy. I had the ending guessed less than half way through.Not so terrible that I wish I had those two hours of my life back, but I don't think I'll be watching it a second time."
4,"A chick flick, but...",Actually a pretty good movie. Watch it with your lady and she will be melting into your arms by movies end.
5,One of the greatest love story ever told,"Everybody said it is a very good movie, I bought it, I watch it and I totally agreed. It is one of the greatest love story ever told, simple yet romantic. It is hard to say it has a sad ending or a happy ending. It depends on one's points of view. It is sad that at the end she didn't even recognize him, it is happy that they were together till the end. DVD's picture and sound quality are excellent."
5,Great movie for out time,"You don't see many movies that our made like this anymore. I am normaly not a love story sappy person. not that there is anything wrong with them i am just not the person who normaly rents them. But I did this one, it was great I was so blown away by the story that I had to go buy it. My husband got chills from the story and he hates love stories. I know quite a few people who said the cried. But the other thing is it is not a story that leaves you upset all day. when and if you cry about it , its not like your dog got ran over kind of thing. It is a great movie and the story is well written."
2,Contrary to popular belief...it's really not that good,"So I finally got around to seeing the movie that I heard was SO sad and SO good and was thoroughly disappointed. Boring romance; nothing really unique. I'm assuming the story is about the power of love, but isn't every love story about that? It lacked depth, and I've seen comedies that were sadder. Literally.Fortunately, it saved itself from one star I would otherwise have given by the redeeming (though sadly brief) role of James Marsden, just by his being so gorgeous."
3,IT WAS O.K.,"This movie was pretty good, but not as good asit's hyped up to be. That acting was good, andthe story was decent. It's a good rainy day movie,just don't expect too much out of it."
4,Wonderful book brought to life,"I am a big believer in the book is always better and with a tearjerker like this I really didn't think Hollywood could do it justice. But they did a very good job bringing these heartwarming characters to life. They did change one major detail that will affect their ability to make a movie of the Wedding Nicolas Spark's sequel, but I actually thought the change added to the story. Definitely worth seeing!"
5,The Notebook,It is a beautiful story of endearing love and loyalty. The movie has great characters portrayed by an awesome cast.
2,The Notebook,"An avid Spark reader, I expected to have a romantic, sad tale as its precessors, the tale started off a cute, lighthearted, sweet story of summer love. AFter about 30 minutes into the film, I lost all interest as Hollywood took this tale into a questionable movie to show teens. It was sweet and loveable, but for parental sake, I would watchg this movie BEFORE showing your young teens."
1,This cd sux,"Uber Alles may have been a little entertaining but this album stinks. Have we not heard enough of the same old repetative guitar hooks and cookie monster vocals already? All the songs sound the same and the hype didnt live up to its expectations, kind of like the album. DOnt buy it if you hate repetative Nu-Metal esque music. I sold this cd instantly."
2,Not useful if targeting a 700+ score,"I recently, completed reading this book.This book's decent reviews attracted me as I required some extra practice.But after reading the book I am surprised why people have given good reviews to the book.Here is my take:Positive:1. The book is OK for beginners who need guidance on very basics.2. I can't think of anything else good about this book.Negatives:1. The book has very few sample questions2. The introduction to each section is useful for very beginners. Anyone who has read kaplan or OG would not find the theory interesting.3. The most important: The answer choices in critical reasoning/reading comprehension not similar to actual test. Some of the explanations are actually silly and it's hard to agree with the book at several places.I would not recommend this book to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Doesn't taste good,I noticed this helped my 14 year old Border Collie with her mobility. Problem is that it's a real chore for her to eat it. She simply does not like the taste of these tablets.
4,My dog thanks you,Gunnar is about 10 years old. He is a huge lab and is beginning to feel the effects of age. This product eases his way in the world. Your prices were good and service as described.Thanks.
1,Dog refuses to eat tablets,"Prior to trying this product, we used Pet Naturals soft chews for hip & Joint, which we purchased through Puritans Pride. They were more expensive, but appeared to work very well on our 13 year old Husky. After reading the positive reviews on this product we decided to try and save some money and purchased Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint. Our dog is not a fussy eater, and has never rejected any type of medicine or treats. She spit these out immediately and refused to eat them. I broke off a piece and tasted it myself and found that it had a very, very strong citrus flavor. I can never recall seeing anything citrus on any dog food or treats. I absolutely cannot understand how all these other reviewers could possibly endorse this supplement (I can, but it would only be unfounded speculation.Please consider my advice and avoid this medication."
2,Broke second time I wore it.,I love the look of the pin but it's not very strong. I put it on my hat and it broke the second day I wore it. :( The decorative front just fell off the pin part. I know it's an inexpensive piece but I was expecting a bit more even so.
2,Too much head-hopping.,"I purchased the unabridged audio edition of this novel, and while I was impressed with the narration, I was disappointed overall with the story. I'm a fan of vampire novels, but the vampires in this story were all evil. I just didn't care about any of them, and they spent most of the time killing and murdering each other in gruesome ways. Also, there was too much head-hopping. I would just get used to one set of characters when the author went off to discuss another group. Perhaps if I were a big white wolf gaming geek I might be overcome with interest about what one vampire clan was doing to another. But as fiction goes for the uninitiated this bored me to tears. 2 stars."
4,Good book but not up to salvotre,First let me say that I love salvatore's books. I think he is an amazing author not just drizzt but also the demonwar saga and vector prime. That said I think this book could have been done better. The end was pretty anti climatic of course I also didn't like how the love interest ended. What I did like was the fact that we got to understand how entreti ended up the way that he was. The fight scenes were great and the fact that entreti never backed down even when faced with death was awesome. The end did leave room for more books on entreti which I would love to read.
3,Inferior to the first two,"The first two books were superior to this latest and final installment. The book just seemed to be missing a true purpose. Everything done in the book seemed to have no real point or consequence.Also Artemis Entreri seems to have become less and less relevant as the books continue. What once was a truly dangerous, no change that, deadly character seems to becoming hardly able to hold his own in many situations. And that is a shame. Entreri, in my opinion, is a great character. Hopefully Salvatore will change direction with this character in the future.All-in-all if you read the first two books than you really do need to read this one. Even though it does have many pitfalls it is still an alright read."
2,A great fall off from the first two books in this series.,"I am a great fan of R.A. Salvatore, but this book is a disappointment. It starts off very well, only to die out in the middle. Salvatore does a great job of building up events to epic proportions, only to have an anticlimactic ending. For the rest of the book we plod along looking into Enteri's past. It could have been interesting, but it was too slow and drawn out. Maybe it was just out of place in this book. And don't even get me started about the strange handling of the love interest! Oh well, I guess you can't knock them all out of the park."
5,Ramazzotti's best,This is surely one of Ramazzotti's best works. His great voice with some great guitar licks here and there are magnificent. Wish I'd known about amazon.com before - it'd have saved me many trips back to Italy to buy music!!!
1,Never again,I will never get the time I spent with this book back. Could the scene at the end be any more freakin drawn out? Someone recommended this book to me.......I was Slaughtered...never again!
4,Read these in order,"I've read all of Karin Slaughter's books now. And, in typical fashion I read the entire series backward. This may have nothing to do with my dislexia, but you never know. Karin writes a very good suspese story and manages to capture much of the feel of Georgia. And for those of you that aren't blessed to live here, it's not all deliverance country. Karin takes a look at a community based on faith, in a believable way in this book without making them all seem like Jim Jones followers, although that does come to mind at times.Karin as created some very well thought out and crafted characters and this book continues to give them life."
3,"Well, okay.","Women, power, murder, politics, confusion. Someone assasinated the woman president of the US. This novel no worse than the ones pouring out of WDC by Senators, former Cabinet Officers, and whatever."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"The person I bought this for was VERY happy about this. The fact that it was engraved, and packaged in a nice box (easy for wrapping) was a HIT.It was a bargain, too!I wish I had more gators fans with business cards, so I could order more!I did not have any trouble with shipping and received it in plenty of time."
1,WTF is up with this copy right stuff!,Luv the tracks Manny but wtf. I just got an iPOD and that what i use only.Cany play the disc in my car and cant transfer to iPOD. Remixes are really great but not classified material. The store actually wont take it back cause its some NY state law. Sux!
5,A Classic in its Time,"In reading Heart Sense by Dr. Paula Reeves,I have found this book to be a vast and deep sounce of the most practical and applicable knowledge and wisdom for changing your life from a fate-oriented, sad and unfulfilled life to one of living consciously into your own personal destiny .Dr. Reeves has given us a truly brilliant blueprint intergrating the current scientific and medical research with the intuitive wisdom of the body mind heart. For me, this is the jewel in an immense array of ""self-help"" books out there. It is so much more that it falls beyond that catagory. Thank you, Dr. Reeves, for this profound work."
4,"I loved it all, mellows me out with tear in my eye.","I loved the movie, it's a thinking movie. I hope that one day I may be able to have a relationship much like the characters in the movie. This soundtrack lets me relive the moments of the movie. The final track on the CD is absolutely beautiful. With a tender voice and the emotion-stirring instrumentals in the background working in conjunction with the lyrics of Track 12, I can listen to the song repeatedly. The song is so powerful, it's perfect for a wedding."
2,"much smaller than you'd think, otherwise good","It's not really 'winter weight' or thick in any way.Order 1 or 2 sizes bigger than you think, my pants would be 32x32, I ordered a medium, it's too small. I will order a large though, since its otherwise a good product."
2,Great vendor - not so great product,"This vendor, East Valley Apparel, is the first Amazon shipper I've found to ship as fast as Amazon, which is quite a feat. I received the union suit in three days. Unfortunately, the suit did not fit my long, skinny frame and I found the material a bit scratchy so I sent it back. They received it back without issue. Wow! I give the vendor five stars."
4,SAFE FUN for younger children,Great fun for 7-12 year olds--safe for younger kids without having to balance as much as the anti gravity boots
2,difficult to use/clean,"It looks decent. But it is not as good as the plain ugly-looking pressure cookers I used 10 year ago. Better in looking, worse in functioning. And it is time-consuming to clean it - at least 10 minutes. In a word, I regret that I bought it."
3,Very Basic and Disappointing--A Glorified Pamphlet,"I guess I should have expected that a thirty-page booklet wouldn't have much meat, and I was right. This material is good, as far as it goes. It's just a gloss, however.If you're new to management and are concerned or intimidated about giving direct, honest feedback to subordinates then this pamphlet is a good (although expensive for what it is) place to start. If you've been around for awhile, then look elsewhere and spend your money more wisely.Some of the other titles in this ""For the Practicing Manager"" series looked intriguing but I'll look elsewhere. Given the bad taste in my mouth about this one, I won't purchase another twelve-dollar pamphlet."
4,Bypassing Bypass,"I have not had heart problems, thank God,though I know others that have and then did Chelation Therapy and can attest to the improvements they have experienced as a result. I read this book as a marketer of Oral Chelation products with EDTA. Dr. Cranton's description of treatments and the help that he documents patients receiving is truely astounding! I since have had others in the CardioCare industry admit to me that, as Dr. Cranton states, some 50% or more of Bypass surgery is unneccasary! It is Big business! EDTA has been used for 30+ years by the Navy to cleanse sailors of lead and Dr. cranton makes the point that it is also effective in chelating many other metals from our system. I continue to take Oral Chelation daily and at 53 continue to act like I'm 33. A wonderful and inspiring book to open ones eyes to the wonders of Alternative medicines ignored and discouraged by the established Medical/Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex."
2,How gullible are you?,"In a nutshell: apparently, there are a number of alien races who have come here to earth in order to take our resources. These aliens live under the earth in caves and are quietly influencing our political leaders and as much of the population as possible in order to easily gain those resources.Meanwhile, there is a group of benevolent wise alien races on the outskirts of our solar system. These guys have (telepathically) sent books and books worth of messages on how to defeat these intervening aliens to this one guy in Colorado. Very convincing."
4,Must have fantasy football book!,"Anyone involved in fantasy football, even fantasy sports in general, should read this book.Highly entertaining read from a person who left his job to write a book on fantasy football.Enjoy."
2,Waste of time,"I guess I'm in the minority here, but I found this book to be an utter waste of time. I suppose if you've never played fantasy football before, you might find it insightful, but if the dude's going to quit his job, I'd expect him to elevate his game just a bit. I've been playing FF for a few years, and I honestly can say that I learned nothing from this book. Additionally, his writing style was immature and dull. He gave us very little reason to care about him or his quest, other than the fact that he's lost a lot in the past. Save your money."
1,Not made like they used to be,"I purchased these exact boots four years ago and they were durable for the most part and wore out as synthetic shoes usually do after a few years. I was very disappointed to find that the quality of these boots have decreased dramatically. The soles were wavy/warped, there was still some residual glue on the sides that I had to clean off, and when I wore them for the first time one boot scratched the other and I had to use a black marker to try and disguise it. This never happened with my previous pair. I realize that they are not leather so I lowered my expectations for the quality, but really, this is rediculous for $50 boots. I didn't return them because it is hard for me to find non-leather shoes that I really like so I am trying to make them work...plus I didn't want to be out of any more money by paying to have them shipped back to the company. Oh yeah, and I ordered the wide calf and got the regular...fortunately they are stretchy and they still fit my leg."
1,"Boring, dry, and uninformative","This book is boring, boring, boring. It's as boring as its title. Additionally, the book is simply not informative. I bought it expecting real-world stories from the trenches. What I got was a rehash of the BOL (Books Online) with no real DBA advice. I'm very sorry I bought this book and intend to return it."
1,Not worthy of publication,"Not only is this book NOT the ""best choice for the DBA of the new millenium"" (snicker,snicker) -- it wasn't even worthy of publication in this millenium or any other. The book is a complete waste of print. It is merely a guided tour of the books online. It's rife with glib comments and generalizations. You get the impression that the author does not really know the technology. So, combine lack of technical prowess with poor writing and what do you get? This book."
4,Oz does MB20,"First heard these fellas while visiting Sydney seven years ago. The stateside band they most resemble musically and lyrically would be Matchbox 20. So if you like Rob Thomas and the boys, treat yourself to an Oz rendition; you won't be sorry. Just Beautiful!"
1,Lil Mama should have charged little to nothing for this book,This book was stupid and it talked about nothing!
1,HATED IT!!!,"at the risk of sounding completely street trash -- which is what the book was -- it ranked just short of airport trash. you know, the type of book you buy when you're going through an airport and just HAVE to have SOMETHING to read. i gave the book away, and this was AFTER someone talked me out of burning it.however, it was actually BETTER than her first book, the name of which i have, by the grace of God, forgotten."
3,Great Book - Long story,Very cute idea...very great premise. Bad part is it could have been told in a shorter book.It's just too long. My kids lose interest a few pages after the boy is on the side of the road.I get it...but it could have done the same job/purpose faster/shorter.my opinion - good for kids 10+ but it reads for kids younger. Adults will like it...it's written for us really.
4,a matter of perspective,"This book is essential for the library of every scholar of American constitutionalism. For those who have studied the subject, the superb selection of essays on different aspects of American political thought is enlightening. Those who are simply interested in America's founding may however be at a loss and overwhelmed by the wide range of arguments put forward in the different essays even if Gary L.Gregg did an excellent job in the introduction giving an overview to the reader of what he should expect in each essay. Thus, since all and even the American constituiton and its origins is a matter of perspective, this book can only be enjoyed after a thorough study of American political thought. For constitution freaks however it is not only useful to have, it is a real joy to browse through the essays."
2,Will not work on large watches,"So beware, for regular size watch's only. Will not open a Marine Star, or anything bigger."
4,Waterproof Watch Case Opener,"There were no instructions sent with the opener, but was able to open most of the watch cases I tried."
2,sucky.,I was able to open one watch with this. The rest I fought for hours trying to get the pins to stay when i went to unscrew the back. don't waste your time with this. i'm ready to throw mine in the garbage.
1,Very disappointed!,"I received my watch case wrench today but without a single key included. Nothing but the wrench was shipped. Obviously, without the key inserts, the wrench is nothing more than a paperweight. Now I will have to order another wrench but I assure you that it will not be from Paylak."
3,A great album,"I think this album is as good as 'scream if you wanna go faster' of geri halliwell. The two have been made with a marketting and capitalist target! Its desappointing! the two spice have a good single of introduction but the others of their album arent as good, and most rae very bad!My favorites: 1.What took you so long (very good) 2.Take my breath away (my favorite) 3.A world without you (good ballad) 4.What i am (not bad but..) 5.Spell it out (not very goos, passable)its all that! ... mp3 rulez! ;D"
2,The lid does NOT stay on - EVER!!,"If you look at almost every review here, they will all mention the lid that doesn't fit. But yet most of those people give it a 4 and 5 start review. I am sorry but a toy whose lid does not fit is a disaster. It falls down and falls apart, pieces get lost, kids get aggravated, etc.... The idea is adorable. It is learning (colors, shapes, counting, matching) until about the age of 3 and then can be used as pretend play. So this toy has the potential to be used for a long time. But calling Learning Resources - this item is discontinued and yeah, you guessed it - you are OUT OF LUCK. So ours stays in a large ziplock bag to avoid losing the chocolates and my daughter who is almost 3 is beyond annoyed that the lid DOES NOT FIT. So sorry folks, this is NOT a 5 or even a 3 start item if Learning Resources couldn't even make a lid that locked in place, let alone even just stay closed. 2.5 stars"
4,super cute!,"This is a very nice set- great for fine motor skills, memory games, and appealing for little ones. The chocolates have good colors, a nice, smooth texture and are pleasant to handle. The chocolates are larger than they appear in the photo which is also a nice bonus.I will be using this set as a therapist(OT)and I think my kiddos will love it.The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the lid on the heart shaped box doesn't have good closure. When you put it on, it doesn't stay closed- a problem for me since I'll be transporting it from house to house. I can just see all the spilled pieces in my car now! Otherwise, love it."
3,Not that bad - not that good either.,"Thought I would get album versions on some tracks but no...Thought I would get 12"" original remixes but no...Newly remixed versions of tracks that should be their original 12"" versions. THAT was a dissapointment. They even left out some songs that were their great songs late 80's. And why even save playtime on a greatest hits album.... 65 min on 15 tracks you do the math. It could be longer about 77 min could might do the trick. Add on the title ""Almost"" Greatest Hits."
4,Great compilation of Expose's best work.,"I've been a fan for about 12 years. I was hooked as a young teen and have adored them ever since. This definitely has some of their best work yet. The two songs on this album that best represent their work from early on and more recently are: Seasons Change and I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me. Then there are all the great hits in between, i.e. Point of No Return & Let Me Be The One. I have been looking high and low for this CD in stores, but it's impossible to find. If you find it, BUY IT!!!"
5,Great condition,"Book arrived in great condition and on time. My daughter needed it for college, so it was great to get it so quickly so she could take it back to school with her after Winter Break."
2,falls apart,"I recieved two koala brand hooded towels as gifts and BOTH came apart at the seams by the second wash...cute, but not made well."
1,Crummy Craftmanship,"I registered for and received this adorable hooded towel as a gift. I washed it one time, gentle cycle with Dreft and both the ears ripped open and all the stuffing came out. Not good! Go with the duck or the frog."
2,Orientalist Fantasy,"I'm with Kimberly. Although the book is richly peppered with colour and B&W photos and drawings, the book as a whole is a prime example of Orientalist fantasizing about ""othered"" Muslim women gone wild. Croutier makes blanket generalised assertions such as ""In traditional Islamic cultures, most women would sooner stand naked in a marketplace than uncover their faces"" and incorrectly misquotes hadith as Qur'anic text betraying ignorance of the most basic tenets and foundational structures of Islam. If Croutier can make such simple mistakes as this, can we trust anything she has written as being anything more than snippits of wild Orientalist fantasies passed off as ""fact"" to an unsuspecting audience? I think not. My advice is to cut out the pretty pictures and throw away the rest (or recycle it if you're environmentally conscious)."
5,"Exquisite look into ""the world behind the veil""","A beautiful, well written book, richly illustrated with paintings by Ingres, Sargent, and Lewis, as well as traditional Turkish woodcuts & miniatures. Croutier takes an intimate look at an obscure subject, making for a fascinating read. All aspects of harem life, from eunuchs to the elaborate bathing rituals, are detailed, with the gorgeous color plates enhancing the experience. Definitely a book you will remember."
3,"Good, but not enough to stand by itself","I've always been loyal to Yamaha keyboards, so when I decided to purchase a new (consumer-level) keyboard, I figured I'd continue to be loyal to the tradition. Well, after having dropped by the local Sam Ash music store, it seems like it's going to be the end of that tradition. As much as I continue to love the sounds that Yamaha offers in its keyboards, the power that this one delivers, along with the design it comes with (don't know... things are just oddly placed, in my opinion), made me drop my wish for another Yamaha, considering my budget max of $300 for a keyboard these holidays. Instead, I will be buying the Casio WK-3000 Professional Series 76 Key Digital Recording Studio Styled Keyboard, which came out in late 2003."
2,Westender,"The service in receiving this movie was exemplary. I wanted a copy so I could point myself out to friends and family. As movies go, it is slow, disjointed, and painfully predictable. Some of the acting is decent and some of the choreography was excellent."
1,Like being bored? Buy this movie!,"Wow. I watch a LOT of film...and manage to enjoy most of it just for production's sake, or for my own edification. This takes the cake as something I tried to enjoy from ANY angle and just couldn't. I tried to stay awake for most of the film but actually fell asleep due to lack of plot. I convinced myself to restart the film the following day thinking it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong.Getting past the lousy quality of story and action, be warned that this DVD would not play on ANY of three computer DVD machines I normally use to watch movies (my personal plus two at work) and I was amazed that it loaded quickly into an older Sony component model DVD easily.Don't waste your time, find something that offers any of the above instead: a story, some decent acting, passable cinematography, a good swordfight, beautiful scenery, lush music, pretty production elements. Westender has none of them."
5,A Great Introduction to Louis Braille For Children,"First off, I would like to warn customers that this is definitely a children's book and geared for a very young audience (readers between maybe 1st and 4th grade). I didn't realize it at the time when I bought it so I thought I would mention it to other customers so they are aware of it. However, I read the book anyways and I must say as an adult reader I still enjoyed reading this book very much! It took me a little over an hour to read the whole thing, but in the end I still enjoyed learning about Louis Braille and his amazing, inspirational life. This book has definitely inspired me to go on and try to find more books about his incredible life."
5,Great book on Louis Braille,"I bought this book to read to my two children, ages 4 and 5, to help them get inspired to learn Braille. It worked! This book is fantastic. Well written, engaging story, fast paced, but still makes you cry at the end. At approx. 80 pages, it took us about an hour to read, in one sitting. I am glad to know more about this amazing man."
1,Returned - POS,"Seems like the quality on this product has gone down the tubes - because the balls certainly don't! Ball gets stuck at the bottom of the tube. After failing to get the ball in the tube on the green, I went to the sidewalk and that didn't even work. Handle also bent after a couple of smacks. Total POS. Actual bag looks like cheap nylon. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Weak design,"I received it today and picked up about 5 golf balls and I noticed that the bracket holding the handle to the tube was starting to bend, so I immediately boxed it up and returned it. Even for lightweight use at home I can't recommend this"
2,Not up to par,"It is difficult for me to understand the more positive reviews for this shag bag. This is the first one I've purchased, so perhaps the grade is based on a curve. Sure it is all metal, but the thin aluminum that connects the handle to the tube bends easily with the pressure needed to pick up balls. after 2 or 3 balls, it is quite bent. It takes quite a bit of pressure to get balls into the tube. I envision over a season, that these brackets will break off, so I returned mine."
4,"Great to have, very useful",I practice ALOT so i needed one of these awesome shag bags. like every other one it does what its supposed to. BUT i wouldv'e been happier if it was better quality. it came broken (a screw wasn't in). i fixed it and it was fine. its a little junky but for the price i wasnt expecting any better. it serves its purpose thats for sure.
2,So-So Product,"I purchased theInTech Shag Bag (Red)for what I thought was a fair price. And it probably was a fair price compared to more expensive models.However, they say you get what you pay for and that's the case with this product. It is a bit flimsy and if you aren't careful, I could see where the handle would eventually break off due to the weakness of the metal used.So, if you're looking for an inexpensive ball shagger that won't last you a lifetime, the InTech Shag Bag will probably work for you. If you plan on using your ball shagger more than once a week, I'd recommend purchasing a more durable product."
4,This album really rocks! 4 1/2 stars.,"OK, I like everything Xymox does - even the much despised ""Headclouds"" (which was the one before this one). There is a distinct Sisters of Mercy sound to parts of this CD, but with the characteristic Xymox dark/spacy textures. Surprising enough in places to be more interesting than some of their previous albums. A real solid work."
5,Great Rumpole collection,"Barrister Horace Rumpole suffered a near-fatal heart attack (see RUMPOLE RESTS HIS CASE) and convalescences in the Primrose Path Home while his colleagues mount a death watch and a competition to replace him. Bored, cranky, at war with much of the staff, and feeling like a prisoner with a life sentence, Rumpole learns that another patient fellow patient died under strange circumstances. Refusing to rest at the rest home, Rumpole escapes confinement and is back on the case trying to learn what happened to his rest home mate.That is the first of five cleverly designed stories and one other well written but flawed tale that brilliantly return Rumpole back in London solving cases, obeying his wife Hilda, and entertaining his myriad of fans while he achieves all that. John Mortimer scores big time with this superb collection that ends with a toast the barrister's fans will join Hilda in hoping that Horace has more escapades next year.Harriet Klausner"
2,Rumpole and the Primrose Path,"When I received the book, I discovered that it started on page 39, went to 86, started over at 39 and went to the conclusion. I prefer to read all of the pages and not just 39 until the end."
4,Worthy successors,"I have been a Rumpole fan for many years, and although I agree that these stories are not quite up to some of the earlier stories, I still find them highly enjoyable."
3,"A ""gawker's handbook"" on trees","This is a reprint of a 1967 original, but actually it looks even older, both in the kind of illustrations (smallish black & white photographs of a quality that varies from fair to excellent) and in the style it is written. I imagine this will be prevent it from being very popular among today's spoiled readers.Having said that, there is a wealth of information here measured out in easy-to-digest bits. It is good that this book continues to be in print: it will reward the reader who takes the trouble of digging out what he needs."
5,The return of the tall blond man withe one black shoes,"If you saw the first movie ""The tall blond man with one black shoes"",and enjoy it,you 're not going to be desapointed with this one."
3,AAIGHT DEBUT.,"CLASSIC.LYRICS ----------- 7/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF D.J PREMIER & CO. -------- 8/10ALBUM COVER ------------ 7/10CONCEPT --------- 9/10THEME --------- 9/10GUEST APPEARANCE --------- JAZ O,SAUCE MONEY & BIGSTANDOUT TRACKS -------- D'EVILS,BRING IT ON,DEAD PRESIDENTS&22'S.OVERALL -------- AAIGHT."
5,YOU GOTTA GET IT!,"This is what is known as a hip-hop classic. From such groud-breaking cuts as ""Ain't no nigga"" and ""Dead Presidents"" to the true to life experiences expressed in ""Regrets"" and ""Can't Knock the Hustle"", anybody with a true love of hip-hop can relate to and enjoy this album. Jay-Z is a true lyrisist, which is so hard to find these days. Just how Biggie made you feel his work, Jigga paints a vivid picture of life in the game."
5,Probably the BEST c.d. ever made!,"All true hip-hop heads agree that this is top 5 minimum. But for this fan, it doesn't get any better than this. Jay-Z makes words ryhme that shouldnt. This is not for those who started listening to rap because of Eminem and 50 Cent. If want truly mind-blowing lyrics amazingly delivered right on beat, Jay-Z is the artists for you. And this is him at his best. Jigga doesn't try to tell you how to live your life a certain way and sound like he is preaching(Nas has done this too much). He is giving you poetry from the streets of Brooklyn. If on first listen you don't believe me, its cool. It takes a couple listens to catch everything, like all great cd's do. And what are the other 4 best hip-hop cd's of all time you ask? Outkast: Aquemini. Biggie: Life After Death. 2Pac: All Eyez on Me. Nas: Illmatic. Holla."
5,hip hop classic,i wish i could give this album more stars its just that good.This is the perfect hip hop album. even the weakest song aint no .... is good.what more can you ask for in this album.If you love hip hop then you will love this cd. it is 1 of the greatest albums of all time
5,ridiculous,"How could someone put words together so smoothly and intelligently as Jay-Z did? It'll take you a hundred listens to even begin to comprehend these rhymes and a hundred more to get the album down. The beats complement Jay so perfectly and make his rhymes stand out even better.Blueprint was better musically thanks to Kanye, but Reasonable Doubt is right up there with Illmatic and 36 Chambers in lyrical mastery."
1,Very Disappointed,"We were very disappointed with this Bob the Builder dvd. My children love Bob the Builder and own every video. We were excited to hear that a new one was coming out soon (especially on Dvd). However, it is not new! Every episode on this dvd is on the other videos (or has been on the Nick Jr. show at least 6 months ago). I would have never thought they would release a new dvd/video without any new episodes. If this is your first Bob the Builder dvd/video, then I would recommend it. If you own many others, then don't bother getting this one because you have already seen it."
5,Bob the Builder vidoes,"Bob the Builder videos are great! I bought these for my 4 year old son, and I am hooked on them too! I can't wait for new ones to come out! I only let my son watch education movies that teach cooperation, manners, etc. I can't stand movies like Rugrats that have rude, obnoxious children that disobey their parents, etc. Bob the Builder is a winner!"
5,BOB,"Bob the Builder are great for little ones and easy to understand the concepts of sharing, working together and completing a job!"
5,Good Machine,"I've had this machine for 3 or 4 years now and I'm very happy with it. It gives a great workout. I busted a bolt holding the vertical handles in place a couiple of years in and was happy to find it was a common part that I picked up from my local hardware store. Two hours and a tub of grease later it's running better and quieter than ever. It's reasonably self-serviceable.It's also designed with humans in mind, not your furniture, which is a good thing. I checked out machines for 18 months before I found this one and every other machine was designed for folding for storage or novelty value, with bad stride length and no life span. This one was the only home machine I found that took biomechanics into consideration rather then trying to fit it under your bed. It's great. If you want a proper resistance free workout, buy it. Btw, it mentioned above that there's a PC interface? I haven't found it but I'm going to take another look."
3,Pretty Good,with the right Music Taylor Dayne would have been more interesting.Her voice is Good.but the material hurts it alot.I'll always Love you was the Cut.but tell it to my heart was Dinky then&now.Can't Get enough of your Love does Barry WHite a bad InJustice.it misses the Soul&fire that Barry gave it on the Original.The Mixes here also water down this Disc.with the Right Material She may have been Bigger.we will never know.
2,weekly critic,"Too confusing, for the most part, hard to keep track of time periods. Most important, the movie left me highly depressed. Skip this movie!!"
4,Reprint of the history of British Rifles,"For the average Lee Enfield owner it will be an interesting thing to know that its older brothers where even flintlocks. Did you know that the british laborers planted walnut trees in 1800 and that this was the basis for a succesion of fine guns.The first part of this reprint tells the history of the rifles and in the last part it deals with questions from readers, including exploded views of the No1 and No4 rifle.Lots of little details like ""Enfield"" indicating the type of rifling and not the place of the facotry, types of amunitions in charts etc.If you have a Lee Enfield this is a book you can not mis."
3,not his dreamy happy stuff but good effort,I love Ferry Corsten for his dream-like epic anthems he is reknown for...but I think he was probably experimenting a little here moving more towards darker themes with added vocals.... He still maintains some of his traditional tunes eg Gouryella's Tenshi track 14 is amazing....
1,Never received item,"I ordered the 32 oz. Acetone and never received my order its been about 2 months. Shipment arrival estimate was 6/8/2010 and its 6/25/2010 today, i ordered it 5/15/2010."
5,Best book on how to get the most from Nikon's NX software,If you like NX this book will make you love NX. It gives details not covered in the manual and how to's that you will not find anywhere else. Jason Odell has given NX users the simplest and best book on how to get the most from your Nikon RAW files and NX. If you use NX you need this book.Highly Recommended
1,Has absolutely no cheese flavor what so ever !,"I just tried this popcorn and it has absolutely no cheese flavor what so ever! It just tastes like regular butter flavor.The one reviewer below said it tastes just like the fancy tin containers of cheese popcorn, but this is not true.Don't waste your precious hard earned money on this product if you are looking for good cheese flavor on your popcorn.I'll have to try another brand I guess.Thanks"
1,Competition Reloading with Brian Enos,"I was expecting so much more from this title.This video should be retitled ""Reloading 101"". A very basic and disappointingly short video featuring the Dillon 650 press. Brian Enos may be a great shooter, but he does not share any secrets about reloading. Best parts of this video are the the Dillon products they use and a fairly adequate job of explaining a taper crimp. You will learn a lot more by taking the NRA reloading course or reading a book on basic reloading techniques. In short, save your money and buy a good reloading manual instead."
4,cool summary of design,"the book's grid is cool and entertaining. the layout is very proffesional and i had many laughs examining the different objects described. recommanded to all design lovers. and if you are interested in graphic design too, a must have title is david carson's ""the end of print"" -isbn 1811811999."
3,"Not typical... yet not quite ""there""...",This CD could be one of the best undiscovered gems... if it were a little more put together. Most of the tracks seem somewhat thrown together without thought... yet the band had *so* much potential to become a legend.Instead they sort of fizzled... and this is the end result.
5,the first mixed cd of classic Salsoul Records,"Labels such as Salsoul, Prelude and West End represented the disco era in the 70's. Salsoul has always been my favourite. This label included artists such as Inner Life, Salsoul Orchestra (Vince Montana) and Double Exposure. I've been waiting for a mixed cd of Salsoul Records for a long time and finally Dimitri's in the house! You will just flow with the music from the first song called ""Seconds"" by Salsoul Orchestra featuring Loleatta Holloway to the last ""Let No Man Put Asunder"" by First Choice. Some of these songs have never been out on cds. Among all of my disco music cds, this one has to be the best!"
5,Not for prudes,"If you can get past the subject matter, (referances to mild acts of bestiality by a young woman) you will love this movie. You almost get the feeling you are looking at a bit of someone's real life. It just has that feel. My hat is off to Bobcat for a truly unique movie."
4,Interesting high tech mix of synthesizer Singing and Rap,"I have never heard any other albumns by them but I like this one. It doesn't fit cleanly into any category and is therfore unique. I don't like rap, but I like the way that this music was put together."
4,See the first setence below.,"The fact that there's only one bad song on it,(Sleeping With An Angel because of bad lyrics,), makes it an extreemly good album. I don't like, ""Sleeping With An Angel"" because there are explicit lyrics in it and I don't like explicit lyrics in music, but the rest of it is really fine. ""Operator"" is an extreemly silly song about aliens coming down to save Earth, (and I mean that as a Compliment!), but I like it anyway. Among my favrite songs are, ""Operator,"" ""Come and Get Your Love,"" and, ""Run Away,"" but there other songs, too. I reccommend this album to you. It's really cool, especially, ""Love and Devotion"" and, ""I Want You."" I like the House Mix of, ""Another Night,"" too!"
4,One-Hit Wonders to the Body,"Ahh, fond memories of this one, I'll tell ya.Dancehall was still fun, still about enthusiasm, still about production, and ""Another Night"" was one of those must own albums back in the day.The whole album doesn't hold up, but it's not supposed to. Dig out the essential singles (""I Want You"", ""Come And Get Your Love"", and especially ""Runaway""), crank the volume up to 10, and get on the good foot."
3,Not too comfy,"The shoes are beautiful, how can they not be, Miu Miu, but now I know why they're reduced from $300 to $60 or something like that. They are not the most comfortable shoes I now own.The more expensive a shoe, usually the more comfortabble. Thanx Susan"
4,"Good, but maybe pace is flagging",As usual pace overall is good. Would like to see more of the Ranger character. Morelli is now somewhat of a sobersides. I think Stephanie needs to progrss rather than stay in the same timewarpStill a good buy
1,Hard Eight,"This was the first book that I have read by this author and if this is any indication of her writing, it will be the last. The only reason that I eventually did finish this book was that I kept thinking that it just had to get better but unfortunately it never did."
4,"Good Book, bad reading on the audio","We have listened to all seven of the previous Stephanie Plum books on audio cassette as we traveled to and from work. This Lorelei person is by far the worst reader. She does an okay job on the characters like Grandma Mazur, but Stephanie's voice is awful. She doesn't sound like a Trenton girl at all. We love the stories, but the previous readers made Stephanie so real to us, that this woman seems like a sick impostor."
3,Not the best,"This was not Evanovick's best effort, I don't think. BUt I kept going and there are definitely some laugh out loud parts, which is what keeps us all coming back!"
3,Not quite as good as others in the series,"I have so far enjoyed all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series (I am reading them in order), but Hard Eight was not as tightly constructed as some of the previous books. The book was enjoyable, but relied too heavily on the established formula for the series, and the ending in particular was disappointing. The ending almost seemed edited drastically to meet a publisher's deadline or page limit. I will continue to read the series, though, as I enjoy the lighthearted intrigue, and Stephanie Plum's character just makes me laugh out loud at times."
2,Big disappointment,I have enjoyed this series of books enormously until Hard Eight. The new characters were not interesting or well developed. The romance was minimal. The story wrapped up way too quickly. This was a very unsatisfying book that would not have stood up on its own if I had not read the previous seven.
2,Hard to Believe....,"..... that this kind of strained nonsense gets published. This is my first and last Evanovich novel and I gave it a 2 only because some of it is funny. But who reads mystery stories for comedy? Hard Eight has something to annoy everyone. The most tepid feminist will hate the incompetent female protagonist who is constantly being rescued by males drawn by her looks. Those looking for even a hint of gritty realism beneath the comedy will look in vain. The characters are cartoons. Men will grind their teeth in frustration at being set up for an ending that doesn't happen. This woman is in need of a editor. But hey, if it sells, plot and character are just incidentals."
3,Still good,"More of the same, but I think this one was a walk in the park for Evanovich. She adds a few plot devices that lack inspiration and toys with them long enough to fill the book... take Bender in already. The lost handcuffs got tired. The Rabbit. And I'm glad Albert Kloughn's, Joe Pesci character got distracted from bounty hunting midway through the book. Lula's character is good, but there only needs to be one.I'm ready for Stephanie Plum to get some skills. I want Stephanie to get the upper hand on Abruzzi and to be a part of bringing him down. I like that when she gets scared she walks right up to her fear and tells him to back off, but why not put some bullets in the gun and keep it handy instead of half loaded at the bottom of an overstuffed handbag. This ending was a disappointment.This series is fun enough to continue following, but I'm glad to be almost caught up so I can cut down to one book a year. Maybe that will help keep it fun. 2.5 stars"
3,"Tired, Lost","Ms. Evanovich hasn't lived near or apparently seen Trenton in many years. I'm tired of Plum. For the real deal, for real comedy try Chris Klim's Jesus Lives in Trenton instead."
4,"Like a Tastykake, but Without the Fat and Calories","Janet E's Stephanie Plum series is one of my guilty reading pleasures. I brought Hard Eight with me on a six hour flight and it entertained me the entire way (wish I could same the same of the airline...). This particular offering doesn't really break any new ground - Stephanie is still the bad luck bounty hunter with an attraction for blown up cars and dangerous men. The regular cast of characters is out in full force - Lula, Grandma Mazur, Joe Morelli, Ranger, and Cousin Vinnie - as Stephanie tries to find a missing woman and child on the run from a mobster and capture a few bond hearing deadbeats (always amusing). The dialog is sarcastic and snappy, but in a few scenes it felt a bit overdone and contrived - no matter though, it's still an entertaining and fun read. I always wondered why they haven't turned any of these stories into a film or TV series - it could really be a great combination of comedy and action/adventure."
4,Eight is Good (not Great),"I like this book series, this one just like the rest. I don't think it's the best in the series but really, if you're reading this review you likely already took in the first 7 so there's no reason to stop now. Some of the situations are forced, particularly the series of handcuff incidents. But in all it's a good & entertaining read and I'll move on the the 9th in the series sooner than later."
2,Janet has beat this dead horse enough,"I loved the first six books. Seven was... It contained material that seemed to be recycled from earlier books and detailed descriptions of Bob's poop. We went from Bob's poop to Bob's puke. Not much improvement at my house. If there is a dumber main character than Stephanie Plum, I've missed the book. She is such a colossal screwup and gets worse at being a bounty hunter instead of better. I wasn't surprised that Ranger broke off the affair after one night. Stephanie is incompetent at everything else, this seemed to be more...than a passionate affair. Kloughn would be more her speed than Ranger or Joe. Stephanie has gone from cute, endearing, gutsy to boring, incompetent, and about as smart as her grandmother who has also lost her charm. Book eight is more original than seven. For that I rated it a 2-star, but it wasn't worth the price of the book."
3,Wrong voice,for those of you that enjoyed the first 7 books on cd and thought the voice was perfect - will not like the voice on this one. the voice is nice - but it is in no way a jersey girl!! names are pronounced differently - and once the wrong name is used. I will think hard before I order book 9 on cd!
2,stephanie never seems to learn from her mistakes,"I've read all eight Stephanie Plum novels (in order), so clearly I got hooked early on. They are funny, clever, quick reading. Janet Evanovich has a gift for writing quirky (if annoying) characters and laugh-out-loud dialogue. However, Stephanie makes the same lame mistakes from one book to another, and usually within the same book. It is frustrating to see ineptitude over and over again, and I began to wonder what the men in her life see in her. Someone once said that what a man really wants in a woman is competence, which Stephanie seems stubbornly determined not to acquire.I may have spoiled the fun for myself somewhat by reading Joshua Armstrong's excellent ""The Seekers,"" about his true exploits as a tough yet compassionate bounty hunter in New Jersey. Nah--I'm just tired of seeing the same old dumb behavior, with no learning curve in sight. It's been fun, but I want Stephanie to gracefully retire."
3,Hard Eight,"As much as I looked forward to this most recent Stephanie Plum book, I found myself being disappointed as I read it. With the preceeding seven books, I had a hard time putting each one down to catch a few winks of sleep before the sun came in the windows. With Hard Eight, I didn't have that problem. I kept reading, thinking that something different was going to happen, but, with one exception, nothing did. It was the same old story with the troublesome bond-skipper and the exploding cars. Fortunately, the humor and relationship tensions were still there, but trying to recreate Benito Ramirez in the person on Eddie Abruzzi didn't quite make the grade. The ending was rather disjointed, as if Ms. Evanovich didn't quite know how to end this story to continue on to the next one.While I didn't dislike this book, I didn't think it was up to the standard of the previous seven. Here's hoping the next one will capture that elusive quality again."
3,Aimless,I've read all of the Stephanie Plum books and this one was my least favorite. I found it rambling and silly. There was not any real mystery or intrigue-just more of the same-the perils of Plum. It's time for some changes.
4,Great stuff!,I must have found 2000 slides in my basement one day and the Opteka Slide Copier helped me duplicated them and now have them in my computers. This is a great product and I feel it works better than using a flat bed scanner to copy slides. It's fun reviewing old slides on the computer and now I can throw out the olds slides which I don't need anymore.
5,All crock-pot owners should have this book!,"As a die-hard crock-pot fan, if one really wants to know what your crock-pot can REALLY do, buy these older cookbooks. The new ones simply don't have that much information in them."
5,Still a Good Way to Get Lucky,This early example of Victor Mollo's bridge writing foretold the great works to come. This play technique tutorial remains as fresh and valuable as it was in 1955. If any of the following is true about you . . .1) No one pays you for lessons2) No one pays you to be their partner3) You too often leave more money on the table than you pick up. . . you can probably learn a thing or three in this classic from Mollo and Gardener.
5,story and characters remain the same,"In the film conversion of Shakespeare's Richard III the time has changed but the story and characters remain the same. The main purpose of this story is to make the film viewer love to hate Richard, which it accomplishes. The movie successfully portrays Richard as a ruthless murderer, liar, thief, and as a downright thug. The setting, in mid to early 1900's is unique, and makes the story more entertaining to the younger viewer. The film successfully uses the most famous and memorable parts of Shakespeare's original play with no awkward moments due to the extensive time change. Overall this film uses Shakespeare's Richard III in a unique and explosively upbeat way."
4,Lovely Nasty Slimeball Fascist,"For me, this was a very enjoyable bit of filmed Shakespeare. The period update to an imaginary fascist Britain is wonderfully fitting for this tale of an ambitious killer and the corpses he leaves in his wake. I loved the 1930's costumes (weren't any women fat back then?)Ian McKellan's Richard is nice and evil. For some reason, he's good at these sneaky, twitchy parts, and in this production he lurches around in his fascist uniform like a good (oops, evil) Richard should. I always wonder why people are taken in by RIchard - he's so transparently wicked. But I guess that's how they liked their propaganda villains back in the day. The sets and overall look of the piece are wonderful."
3,"McKellen, Broadbent, and a broad bore","McKellen shines; when does he not? Broadbent's performance could be easily overshadowed with a viewer that lacks familiarity with his work, but take my word, pay attention to the little things - his mannerisms - that a master actor can do.Now, I realize that I used the word ""broad"" in my title, and while I originally intended it as word-play and to communicate my overall boredom at watching this film, I would be remiss if I didn't comment on what my subconscious wanted to say. Annette Bening is not a great actress. She's not as horrible as Irene Jacob in 'Othello' but she does very little that's good. Kristin Scott Thomas, however, deserves accolades for her understated performance.Additionally, the inclusion of Robert Downey Jr. on the cover is misleading - he plays Rivers, and might be in the film for a total of 5 minutes; as a fan of his work, I was looking forward to seeing him act with the big boys, but that was not to be."
3,This shelf works,"I did a search on ""shelf over washing machine"" and found this item. It is exactly that. Assembly is easy, and it does what it claims. There are more pricey shelving units but this one will hold four or five bottles of detergent, etc.in reach and works fine. You have to play around with the support legs a little to customize it to your washing machine or dryer. It seems more sturdy with the weight of a detergent bottle or two on it than when you first assemble it."
4,Great space saver,"Just received the shelf and it took me about 2 minutes to put together. Just 4 screws with washers and bolts to attach the supports to the rack. I bent the supports to adjust the rack level and had no issues getting it to fit properly. Overall I am quite pleased as it is holding my large laundry detergent, fabric softener, dryer sheets, bleach and stain removal pen. I had to move around the tubes in the back of the washer and pull the washer forward a bit to have enough space for the shelf, but not a big deal at all. Definitely recommend."
4,Great space saver,Good storage for the money! Wish it was a little more sturdy but it's good storage and I already had one for the washer so purchased another for over the dryer. Just make sure that your machine is flat across the top or it will not sit level.
2,not good,this product is not good small and not really helpful for my washer or dryer i am pretty upset with the way this product was made.
5,Wonderful Product,"I will never use any other nail polish except this one again. This is the absolute best nail polish on the market. It has no chemicals, no strong smell, great colors to choose from, and because it is water-based, it does not need any chemical-based polish remover to take it off."
2,Risque is risky,I took the risk and was very displeased. The color was not pretty at all and took too long to dry especially in thehumidity of summer. Don't even try it...Revlon has been recommended in a natural cosmetic book and it's so much better.
4,great photos!,"Great photos abound in this book about various martial arts and some of their famed practioners. Some of the arts profiled are lesser known, but the martial instructors profiled do a decent job describing their art, and the lessons learned about life through its practice.Particularly inspiring are profiles of the only 10th dan female practioner in Judo, and the beautiful shots of Shorinji Kempo in action.A good reminder that martial arts are not always about fighting...but a type of physical zen that leads to discipline and independence."
3,First Discworld and Probably the Only One,"Creating a newspaper in a world that previously hadn't had one was a real eye-opener. It certainly put a new spin on how news is done, how pervasive it is, and explains why ""if it's written down it must be the truth"" is such a truism in our society. The various subplots were interesting enough to keep me reading but the main story of W. De Worde was the most entertaining. I wasn't to keen on the bad guys, they weren't very believable, nor were their deaths. If this is typical of his work I doubt very much that I'd read another."
1,Absolutely Worthless!,I bought this as a girt for my wife a year ago. It has done nothing but confuse and frustrate both of us. The instructions may have well been written in Martian. Leave this alone! If you get it for free you have still paid too much.
2,"THIS CD WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA, BUT....","I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE A LOT OF BARRY CDS AS WELL AS BIG BAND CDS AND THIS PROJECT DOES NOT SERVE EITHER VERY WELL. WHEN I READ THE CREDITS ON THIS CD I THOUGHT I HAD A DIAMOND IN MY HANDS, BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THERE IS A THING CALLED FOOLS GOLD. AS I CAREFULLY PLAYED EACH TRACK I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS. OF THE 16 SONGS LISTED ALL I COULD RELATE TO WAS 6. I GUESS I AM TOO HARD TO PLEASE."
1,Barry Manilow couldn't swing to save the world...,"Good thing saving the would doesn't depend on weather Barry Manilow can swing. because we'd all be in deep sh*t. Manilow is not capable of swinging, he doesn't have a swingin' bone in his body. He sounds like he can't keep up with the ebergy of the band. Manilow is the last person on earth who should be singing with a big band. Barley Man Enough just doesn't pull this off. Too bad..."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE Donut Man!!,"And my 2 year old does too!! This video is her absolute favorite!! The songs are great- very encouraging, Biblical, fun and upbeat! Our daughter claps along, and tries to do the motions to the songs! She gets so excited whenever we turn ""Donut Man"" on! I appreciate that his videos have positive messages about Jesus Christ and teach good values! What more could you ask for in a video?!?! :-) I highly recommend these videos!!!"
5,Good for younger children too,Our nearly 3 yr old loves this book. He doesn't always want to hear the Panda's stories - they are a little dense for him - but he loves the gentility of the panda. This has become his favorite story to hear when he's upset.
1,Not what I expected,"I read the previous reviews and thought, ""finally some working examples"". I got the book and it's a collection of code snippets!?I was particulary looking for datbase and table design. All I got was creating, opening and searching a database. I already knew how to do that. There is no mention of tables, their use and design and no indepth look at data input and manipulation. This is very much a beginners book to get there feet wet in coding for the Palm but any other type of programmer making the move to the Palm enviornment will need to look elswhere."
5,Praise from Smith's #1 Fan,"He is brilliant. His words are a delicious brew that will keep you captivated for days on end, and although each page you turn fascinates you more, you regret the fact that you are ever so close to the end...Monsoon is Wilbur Smith's finest work to date. Levs01@go.com was right; the long wait since Birds of Prey was well worth it. Ignore the critics; this book is so easy to relate to that you are unable to differentiate its plot from your own memories by the time you are done. On behalf of my country (Peru), Mr. Smith, I congratulate you for your latest masterpiece."
5,"Thrilling adventure mixed with love, fate, and irony.",A wonderful book that depicts the life of a sailor in all aspects. A truly great story of one family growing in directions I never imagined. The book never slowed down and many twists to the plot kept me interested for hours on end.
2,Disappointment followed by disppointment.,"I was introduced to Wilbur Smith by the ""River God"" Which I loved, as well as as ""The Seventh Scroll"" and ""Elephant Song"". I couldn't wait to read what came next. I was sorely disappointed by the cheap Harlequin novel set on the sea that was ""Birds of Prey."" It was boring, predictable and unimaginative. After reading the reviews of the sequel ""Monsoon"" I held out hope that was rescue in sight, only to be disappointed again. Boring, predictable and unimaginative repeated."
2,Looks better than it works,"I got this dispenser because it has many good qualities I wanted: red color and high capacity. However, after a few months of use the soap began to leak around the sides of the nozzle when pumped. This makes soap stream down the sides of the unit. In addition, the bottom of the dispenser stained my porcelan sink with a red ring. I wouldnt recommend this product."
2,Propaganda piece,"You may think you're about to read a funny book about family relationships, but beware! This is a propaganda piece for the Catholic Church. Scientific thinking takes a dump here as amazing ""miracles' occur in an already thin plot. This, plus the horrible stereotype of the Italian wife, are too much to stomach."
1,Disappointing...,"I really loved her earlier books, but I've noticed a sort of slide lately. The past three releases, ""Shem Creek,"" ""Pawleys Island"" and this latest one have an ultra-simplistic viewpoint. The plots are becoming less plausible, and for some reason, I am not sympathetic towards the main characters. ""Plantation"" and ""Sullivans Island"" were so rich and fulfilling that I feel as though the author is now just adding water and stirring."
2,A Turn About,"The presentation and theme of this book was a huge turn about from the past writings of Dorothea Benton Frank. Previously, her stories were enormously witty, fast paced, and a mixture of light heartedness and reality. Much emphysis was on the geographical area of the story giving it an almost pulsating feeling of the weather in South Carolina. I truly missed the former way of her writing as I have read all the books she has done. Perhaps she has had a religious experience that has made the difference. I hope in her future writings that she recaptures the excitement, fun, and warmth, she put forth in her other books."
2,Disappointing!,"Full of Grace is such a BIG disappointment! Hopefully, this is just a temporary ""phase"" the writer is experiencing... The characters, especially Grace, lack depth to the extent that they're like paper dolls and stereotypes - in fact, the whole book is just too ""cute,"" had too much religion and too many miracles. In these days of political correctness, if I want to read about religious experiences and conversions, I'll read my newspaper - the storyline in this book was so ""correct,"" that I skimmed over a good portion of it. I've read all of Doreatha Benton Frank's books - Plantation is one that I've kept and have re-read about 4 times - the characters and the lifestyle are warm and funny and interesting."
1,Not worth sinking any money into,"This movie revolves around Jess, who finds out through research that she has Vagina Dentata (Toothed Vagina). She learns this only after she has maimed a male friend who tried to rape her in an isolated cave and a doctor examining her, who ends up with 4 severed fingers that he has to get reattached. Later, she seduces her step-brother, and maims him as well. Over time, she learns that she can control this ""power"" or ""mutant ability"", if you will, if she is relaxed, but if she is stressed, then the condition comes about. This is evident at the end of the movie, when she gives a kind of evil smile as she sits of the car of an elderly man who won't let her out unless he gets some you know what.I saw this movie only after hearing about it from a radio deejay whom had seen it himself. Despite my anticipation, the horror/thrill/chill factor was not there. I was not impressed with the movie at all, and actually found myself laughing through most of the movie."
2,So bad it's good,"This movie is based on a medical condition known as vagina dentata, teeth in the vagina that bite off the particular part of a man that goes past that barrier uninvited. This condition is nothing more than an urban legend, there is no basis in fact.Of course, basis in fact is hardly required for horror movies, since they're almost always based in the supernatural. The issue here is that the plotline is so predictable, the acting so horrendously bad, that the movie leaves you laughing where you're supposed to be scared. This movie is classified as a ""horror comedy"". It certainly achieves the second part, the first is left open to just how far you can distance yourself from what a terribly made movie it is."
1,horrible,That has got to be one of the most horrible idea's for a movie i've ever seen.it was so stupid and ignorant.
4,"OOH, I wish I had that power!","I have been hearing so much about this wild, cult-like film for a while. My Amazon buddies Blackshere, Puzzlebox, Jenny and Tantrum raved about it and enticed me to watch it. Wow, I'm glad they did!I wouldn't call this a horror film (except if you're a guy) but a kind of weird comedy with a twist.What a concept---a girl that has teeth down below! Dawn, a prim virgin high school girl, knows she is different, because she has vagina dentata. At first she doesn't know how to control it, but she soon perfects her wonderful gift. Dawn then uses her magic powers to hurt the men who hurt her. This gets good!I know a lot of us women would like this power!This movie was fairly well filmed and never got boring. There were a few good comic scenes---like what a Rotweiller won't eat and a real dirty old man.All in all it's a fun film to watch. Grab some popcorn, no hot dogs this time!"
1,A Bad Case of Vagingivitis!,"This may be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I mean, how could the director and studio go so wrong with such a beautiful, solid concept? It's basically a feel-good movie about a young woman coming-of-age, dealing with the trials and tribulations of having teeth in her nether-region. I think the script is probably more suitable to the likes of James Cameron or Michael Bay. Imagine what they could've done with it!"
5,CCRP products,This book is provided free to the public through the CCRP web site. It's a shame someone is trying to make a profit of these books.
4,"Very Good, Calming Christmas CD","All the tracks on this CD are beautiful and very calming. Essentially, you can ""feel"" yourself sitting in a darkened room before a crackling fire while snow falls outside. Of the 11 tracks, I've rated six of them as Very Good, four of them as Good, and only one as merely OK (I use Media Player's five star rating system where two stars (not three stars) is OK). My specific track ratings are:1. Winter Wonderland -- 4 Stars2. White Christmas -- 4 Stars3. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas -- 4 Stars4. Silent Night -- 3 Stars5. Greensleeves -- 4 Stars6. Miracles -- 3 Stars7. Little Drummer Boy -- 3 Stars8. Chanukah Song -- 2 Stars9. Silver Bells -- 4 Stars10. Away in a Manger -- 4 Stars11. Brahms' Lullaby -- 3 Stars"
1,Hah. Bad.,"Don't buy this. Please, please, don't encourage this. The way Kenny G ""writes"" is to take an old song, play it at half tempo, and add a grace note, trill, or turn every measure. So basically, purchase of this album could be entirely circumvented by playing a Christmas record on 45 at 33 rpms, and occasionally hitting the turntable.Honestly, if you want good jazz, try maybe Keith Jarrett? He's pretty good. Billie Holiday is a standard, and technically all her music is Holiday music, so you should be all set there. But come on, people, Kenny G? Not jazz."
1,worst cd EVER,I listened to this cd and I threw it out the window. It is the absolute worst cd I have ever listened to. 2pac 4ever!
3,NOT as pictured,"Picture is of CD....received cassette ! ! Kenny G is awesome though. I have this on a CD, have had it for years and love it for Christmas.If one is selling a cassette then the picture should be a cassette! ! ! This is referred to as ""ALBUM"""
5,Holding On and Letting Go,"Transitions present odd responses. Some would suggest we throw out the old and usher in the new. Others consider anything new dangerous and a risk to orthodoxy. Spencer Burke provokes the reader to consider how to navigate the transitions we face. The metaphors he uses capture a very real awareness of the need both to hold on and to let go. Conversations from TheOoze.com offer a glimpse into the very sincere wrestling with what it is to ""be"" the church. Spencer's background makes him a credible fellow traveler on the road to making sense of church."
3,"Nice story, bad book","This book would have been a good online article, but it wasnt a good book. Spencer Burke has a great story and is doing some great things with the ooze.com. I even like the idea of putting the conversations from the ooze into the form of a book, but somehow the book ended up being a cynical approach to most people's forms of Christianity. I am all for the postmodern movement of living the gospel in the context of our culture, but I do not appreciate when the church starts criticizing the church. I felt like this book did that and didnt provide any solutions to what we can do.However, if you want to get a pulse for what the emerging church is doing, this might be a good book for you."
2,Don't Reach Back but Look 4ward to a DIFFERENT BOOK!,"Let me begin by telling you to save your money buy another book. I did not enjoy REACHING BACK. This book had the makings of a really great read. The story of Carrie, Mignon's grandmother was very interesting. The story of Ana, Mignon's mother was like a fantasy or fairytale. The author, seemed to dedicate the last 1/3 of the book to Ana and her adventures with some French prince Pierre. The book just went downhill after Ana's debutante. It should have focused on how Stella/David worked out there marriage after the big bomb that was landed on Stella at the debutante. Or it should have focused on Stella/C.P relationship, did he go throughout life never knowing his parentage? I don't know why the author had to go and mess up a perfectly good story. I've read she is writing a sequel to Reaching Back which will focus on Ana/Mignon more."
4,i've found a new writer!,"i really liked this one. some kids are walking about in the woods. they hear a baby. they see it. it disappears. after a while they start fearing there is something [bad] about this baby. meanwhile, something about the story, seem to upset a woman with a family. something from the past haunts her. then begins some acts of violence. there were some good descriptions here, and there was a good deal of suspence. J's foremost quality, i think, is that she never goes too far. many writers do very stupid things trying to be inventive, or lose interest in their story writing very stupid dialogues, e.g. J has a fantastic self-control it seems. she delivers, and goes not astray. ver good read"
2,"Not a ""Master Class"" - just the very basics",This book would be ideal for beginners to Photoshop and HTML. It has absolutely nothing to offer more advanced users.There is no reason to buy this book for the Photoshop section. The program manual covers the same topics in better detail.As for HTML - there are better books.This was an insult as well as a waste of time and money.
1,Big disappointment,"The Eyewitness Guides are an oustanding series, so I bought this one without a second thought. Alas, this seems more like a placeholder than a serious attempt at writing a guidebook - a kind of ""watch this space"" advertisement masquerading as a book. It's so thin, in fact, that the cover seems to sag; the spine is thicker than the pages! The coverage of Oahu is decent, so if you only plan to go to Honolulu, the book might be worthwhile. But the coverage of Kauai (where we spent most of our time) and the Big Island were very poor. I'd very highly recommend the ""Ultimate Kauai Guidebook"" for Kauai instead."
3,Nice travel book with photos.,"It is a great book, has a lot of color pictures, but dont have great maps and is difficult for travelers.I recommend only for first time visitors to Hawaii."
5,Awsome Movie,OMG. when i finally got this movie i watched it right away and to be honest this movie was to funny. I really enjoyed watching this movie i love the actress she is so awsome.
5,My favorite,"I have loved Patti Smith ever since I was awkward teenager trying to be inconspicuous in an all girls Catholic high school. It seems like whenever I need inspiration or encouragement she has an album, CD, or MP3 I can turn to. This CD is my favorite. The music is distinctly American. With the exception of Summer Cannibals which rocks it combines a kind of Appalachian folk sound with Patti's powerful haunted vocals. My favorite songs are Southern Cross, Ravens, and Wing. There is a universal empathy too intense love, loss and grief. She is not bitter or angry, instead she offers an alternative..... wistful, grateful powerful hope!"
1,Did not receive as promised for Christmas,The stamp set was not delivered by Christmas as indicated when I ordered it. A little girl will be very disappointed!
4,"Doo Wop & Lollipops, Vo 2","My boys (3 and 5) love this CD. They also love the the first Doo Wop & Lollipops CD. They love to sing along and rock in their car seats. They are both quite a sight in the minivan. I would recommend this CD to anyone with young kids. The songs should be familar to adults, as they span from the 1950s to the 1990s. I had to order this CD twice. The first company was unable to get it quickly from the supplier and canceled the order. The second company, CD Universe, delivered the CD to my mailbox in about a week. No complaint with CD Universe."
5,Sensative topic handeled with decerning questioning and reflection,"This is one of my favorite film. Most of us deal with challanges in our faith. On our journy some stay on the train the whole way, some of us get off on different stations only to find out we want to get back on the train, while others get off never to look back at that train track."
3,lotta truth,"Very informative , I hope the narrator found another occupation.His lack of input ruined a well structured piece of history,also ,Custer was a thoughtless butcher the historian was too cavalry sided and knew little about Custer.After the Washita massacre Custer should have been hung , But whitie needed heroes and the Indians weren't part of that picture"
1,Outdated,"This is a horrible documentary. This is American biased, for one example they say during the Wounded Knee Massacre that it wasn't a massacre and that it is controversy on whether they had friendly fire. Research American Horse's account of the events when he testified before congress. Also the narrator has the most boring monotone voice AND he is trying to sound dramatic and exiting... lame!"
2,Not that helpful,"it doesn't absorb that well and leaves a white layer of film around the scar and hair area. Also, it gives my scalp a sensation (not a good one) after use.I might as well just use Mederma scar remove as it's a known and proven product and will also moisturize"
4,wrong service set,"I received the service set with 2 complete sets of silverwear. They were all to match. The silverwear was what I orderd but the service set was a different style. I didn't complain at the time so they could make it right, so that's why I gave 4 stars."
3,disappointing sequel,"While Desert Places, Crouch's debut novel, charges forward from its first pages with unflagging suspense, Locked Doors begins to disappoint as it sags in the middle. The plot borders on preposterous, descriptions of the Outer Banks grow tiresome, and the villians are so one-note that they fail to generate much terror. That being said, the novel is by no means unbearable, and it is worth a read if you're interested in a continuation of the story. Nonetheless, the finale is so bleak that nothing in this book feels hard-won - for the characters or the reader. After two books and seven fictional years, a little closure would have been nice."
1,Handgun Basics for Self Defense & Target Shooting,"I paid much le$$ for this DVD somewhere else online but still to expensive for its contents. Excellent and very entertaining for beginners men, women & juniors with ""cero"" knowledge of guns or shooting experience. Covers the difference between a single action and double action revolvers and semi-automatic pistols plus everything you need to know about owning, operating and shooting accurately.Useless for handgun owners or experienced shotters already familiar with both, revolvers and semi-automatic pistols."
2,Let's All Not Bother,"A self-indulgent conceit from a highly successful and respected author who knows he does not have to try very hard any more. All the characters speak with the same voice. The story leads nowhere and says nothing. The many fantasy elements are used not to illuminate truths, which good fantasy can do, but as an excuse for implausibility and incoherence. The one saving grace of the novel is the affectionate description of some aspects of Los Angeles history and geography. The passages about Mount Lowe are fascinating to anyone who lives here. But if I want to learn more about my adopted city I'll look to a guidebook rather than a third-rate fantasy thriller. There is no doubting Bradbury's greatness. How sad that he now feels able to reel off routine dross like this."
4,An Invaluable Record of the Early Days,"This book is the most important work recording the early days of the apparitions of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, at Medjugorje, a village in Hercegovina. Printed in 1984, it has interviews with the visionaries and other principal personalities closely connected with the phenomenon, some of which were used in Fr. Pelletier's later work ""The Queen of Peace Visits Medugorje"".The work is not a sensationalist piece but an organised and focussed work, giving good background information, a faithful rendering of the facts and balanced theological perspective. You get a good feel of the place in the days before it became a popular destination for millions of pilgrims.I especially appreciate precious details like the names of the other villages in the region, and that the parish of St. James has given 19 priests and 20 nuns, a stunning record of vocations."
2,Not as indepth as expected,The write up of the book is detailed and promises a wealth of information regarding the title. A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the book turns out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and unsophisticated review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book.
1,98 Accord Coupe,When i got it I was excited however it does not fit my car so I ended up throwing it away. The opening is too small for my car.
1,This is a joke!,"I usually look at the reviews, but I didn't because I thought that by now (2012) a company would have a grip on what fits what. I'd like to think that you could trust someones word on the fit of such a simple little item such as a shift knob. This knob by this company that I bought it from is a money grab of some type, because shift knobs don't just fit any car. I fell for it. The part itself is fine for wtfever vehicle it is intended for. But I missed the memo on which one it is actually for. Not a 03 Cavalier, and I would have known that if I had taken just a minute to browse the reviews"
4,Just the facts,"If you are wanting to hit all the main ideas of matrices, this book is very helpful. A lot of the topics covered in the Matrix Operations book is covered in here. Personally, I would look here first. The chapters are broken down a bit more, so you can focus on what you want to work on.The answers aren't printed in this one like other books. In the supplementary problems, some have answers and some have hints. This is a little bothersome because I can't check my work as I would like. It is, nonetheless, helpful.Another good thing is that all key words are in bold to help you learn the terminology.I would recommend this book to help your learning matrices for class."
3,"Good, but could be simpler","It's a great heart rate monitor, but it's a little complicated.I think they could make it easier to use, but it has some cool features."
3,"Decent Product, Decent Value","Purchased as a replacement HRM, The unit does what its intended to do and it does it well. The quirks of changing face information or retrieving data takes a while to learn and get used to. The push-button sequencing doesn't always seem intuitive, but - the good news is - its easy to learn. I don't use my HRM as a watch except as a convenience after working out, so that feature is fairly useless to me, anyway. One simple improvement would be a strap thats a notch or two bigger - I have to wear my unit at the end notch making it somewhat more difficult to fasten and unfasten.Given the quirks and a design you have to grow into, its a decent product and a fair value."
5,Works great,"I got this Polar RS100 monitor to replace an older one I had used for years. My old one went crazy, saying my heart rate was 220 every time I ran past neighbor's yards which had an ""invisible"" dog fence. That threw off my recorded heart rate. This RS100 is not bothered by the ""invisible"" dog fences. Another advantage is that the included chest strap transmitter has a changeable battery. My old one was sealed. I've changed the battery on both the chest strap and wrist monitor, it's easy to do. The only problem I've experienced with this unit is if you don't wet the chest strap enough at the start of your run, it will not communicate well with the receiver (once you work up enough sweat, it works fine.) So be sure to wet it well at the start. It records one run, so I record my runs in a spreadsheet at the end. I've had this for a long time, and like it."
5,Excelente,Reloj de la Polar con muy buenos datos del recorrido y me ha respaldado en todos los recorrdiso hechos en largas distancias con la bicicleta
3,Shouldn't it be grounded in some way?,"Bought it, put it on, then it went dead. I may have shorted it out with static electricity. I've done that before, with several watches and other small cheaper time keeping devices. Must just be me, and I wanted to be able to post this review without a star rating at all (not that I wanted to give it zero stars, I just wanted to post what happend without having to rate it) but since I can't write a review w/o a rating I choose 3 stars to stay in the middle. Never got to use it since it shorted out. Shouldn't these types of devices be grounded in some way? If you're they type of person that gets ""shocked"" by static electricity a lot, I would not spend my money on any expensive electrical item that cannot be grounded."
5,RS100 Heart Rate Monitor,"I have had this HR monitor for about a year. It is very simple to learn to use, and really comfortable. I bought a second one for a friend for Christmas. She found it really easy to get use to too. Very affordable and a must tool for runners."
4,Good product,Works well. Good features. I think for the extra money this is a better value than the really inexpensive models that offer heart rate and nothing else.
4,Great Product,You can put my review on the good list. I have been using this Polar for a few months now and have no issues at all. Works as advertised. Keep it clean and completely wet the chest strap before putting it on and you're good to go. I would recommend the next step up in Polar product if you are looking for greater analysis (dowloading data online etc..) of your runs/workouts.
1,Be prepared to replace transmitter every 3-4 months,"I have used Polar heart rate monitors for several years (since 2005) because they are compatible with both my Precor treadmill and my Stairmaster. In my experience with the new snap-on transmitters, whenever the original battery begins to fade that's about the time the transmitter nears the end of its useful life (about 3-4 months). Putting in fresh batteries is hit and miss, but ultimately the transmitter becomes unreliable if not completely dead. Maybe it is the process of breaking the original seal of the battery compartment or something that causes it to fail. Regardless, I have finally come to the conclusion that these are flawed products. Replacing transmitters every 3-4 months is not acceptible in my opinion."
3,Challenging to program,I was warned that this watch would be difficult to program and the other reviewers were right on the money. The manual isn't much help and nothing about the design is intuitive. I'll probably never take advantage of all the features because I won't have the patience to grind through the programming. I probably should have purchased a more basic watch for a lot less money.
4,Good exercise equipment,Polar RS100 is a pretty good cardio monitor. Everything works as advertised. However the whole body is made of plastic including the wrist strap (part of the body). If the strap breaks then you have to buy another watch. Also the metal buckle on the strap is not designed right. The strap has a hard time to get around the buckle. This might induce material fatigue for the strap. I like the transmitter with a changeable battery. I don't want to throw away the transmitter (chest strap) even though it might be inexpensive. It is not good for the environment.
4,good but not great,"Over all am happy with it now that I have finally got comfortable with what button does what on it. The menu setup of your max heart rate, weight, etc is horrible, and the instructions make it worse. Maybe I have just gone soft in this smartphone era but I now expect a good bit of correlation between button location, button label and button function. All that said definitely four stars, the basic function of it is always rock solid, and has done a great bit for my cycling in the month I have had it. Transmitter works seamlessly with all equipment in my local gym.Note: the strap on the transmitter it comes with is not huge, I am 6' 185LB and only have a bit of slack left in it. If you are much over 200lb you will probably need a longer strap, try one on first."
4,works as i expected,been using for days now and totally satisfied using it as a heart monitor while doing my cardio excercise. excellent product
2,disappointment,It feels like low grade quality and the charging base is a pain to get plugged in. I would rethink this purchase.
3,pleasant surprize,"Id love to rate this one higher...but the songs dont always measure up. the band is not bad, not great, just above average so to speak...different singers on songs makes for a lack of continuity to my mind...I like several songs like colt 45, shade the light, dark of the moon and cry of love...its just that there is so much stuff available today that often decent music gets lost in the shuffle to the top...the musicianship is adequate {Im reluctant to say average or fair) just not memorable enough to make my top 20...that said Id still recommend this disc because it has its moments and thats enough to make it listenable...kind of a wilco/uncle tupelo sound with a female singer...its worth a shot"
1,No cotton,"I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton. There is no cotton in this bra. It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane. If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you."
5,Fantastic Movie!!!,"In my eyes, Beethoven's 3rd is a great movie.I like it the best out of all 4 Beethoven movies.Very exciting, silly and great fun. There are some funny badguys too.Overall a very good movie."
4,works well but also removes paint,"The windshield on my GSXR 600 sportbike went hazy after years of riding. It is made of a clear, hard plexiglass type of material. Based on the positive reviews on this product, I gave it a try.It works well at removing the haze and restored my windshield to about 90% clarity (some minor haze remains but that is probably because I was applying by hand, not with a motorized buffer).The real problem is it also removed small amount of paint from nearby fairings. I was careful to not apply this on any other body parts but even a small amount of rubbing on nearby fairings removed some paint.If I have to say whether this is a buy or no buy, I would say it is definitely a buy. Just be careful how you apply it."
4,great product for the $$!,"Inexpensive, easy to use solution for cleaning up those oxidized head lamps. My Subaru is nine years old, and in otherwise great shape but my headlights were pretty ""clouded."" This stuff took care of it within a few minutes and without too much trouble. The headlights don't look new but show significant calrity and improvement. Basically did exactly what it claimed."
3,Cleared up some of the hazing,I have an 2003 car with those plastic headlight lens and they had become somewhat yellow and hazy in appearance. I bought this in hopes it would clear them up. The product did a ok job it did remove at least some of the yellowing and some of the haze but not all. Can't say for sure if its my fault for letting them go so long or not???.
4,Product not working? Read this.,"If your headlights are really foggy, you will need to use this product more than once. After about 5 applications of this cleaner, my headlights were permanently restored to a decent degree. They are still clear after I wash my car. It's probably going to take 10 or 20 more more applications to get my headlights crystal clear, but it's worth it. This cleaner is cheap and although it takes time, it works well."
1,"If you need to see it in color to learn, you have problems.","With all the original footage out there of the Great War, someone finally decided to ""enhance"" it by colorizing it. Did this need to be done? No. How does anyone living in this day and age know what all the colors were in the scenes from over 92 years ago? Does our glorious modern technology know? I don't think so. So it becomes re-written history in a way (altered historical film footage). It is too bad that today's people can't simply learn from the original black & white footage. They need ""assumed"" colors to enhance their learning pleasure. This colorization is garbage and it belongs with all the other black & white movies that were colorized."
3,Colorized B&W -- Interesting,"A much better dvd series on WWI would be The First World War: The Complete Series (2004). World War I in Color is not a complete set, but less comprehensive and informative. The colorization is an attractive feature to augment the more complete version."
4,spaz... i love spaz,"i love the pictures of spaz. the way the mong drools makes me laugh. he makes me feel good.. how he walks on four legs, me on two. i'll feed spaz in a bowl if i could.. and take him for walks on a lead. good spaz.. good spaz.."
2,just read the book!!,"the little drummer girl was a great novel, but don't bother with the movie. the story is so complex that the movie has to oversimplify it to the point of being completely implausible. i don't think that diane keaton was the best choice for charlie, the actress, as she seemed too old and the clothes she wore (especially the shoulder pads!!) just made her seem too uptight, whereas the book made her seem more free-spirited. i guess the whole movie was just tainted by the 80s, which put a definite time frame on a story concerning issues that are not specific to that time. another problem with keaton was that charlie was supposed to be english. her actual acting in the movie was not bad, but the whole idea of an american star in the english theatre was strange. overall, unless you want a watered-down, mullet-crazy 2 hours, put in a little more time and read the book. it's worth it!"
4,Love This Movie,"I was happy to see this movie offered on DVD as I have watched it several times on VHS. Quality of picture much better on DVD but there were skips early on which could be corrected with fast forward. Since I have seen this movie so many times, it was only mildly frustrating but could prove to be annoying for first-timers. Not enough of a problem to keep me from ordering again from this vendor."
5,"""The Little Drummer Girl"" movie DVD",The Little Drummer GirlAn excellent suspense movie based on a novel by the award-winning author John le Carre.
3,Sources?,"I became interested in this book after the little preview shown on Amazon and Google Books. I was hoping to get a bibliography, but no luck. I've googled the books he mentions... and no luck either. Does the ""USDA nutrient composition book of Latin America"" really exist?"
1,Feet don't fit well,"The tights are nice color and thickness good. However, the fit are not fitted and when put feet inside ballet slippers there is extra material. I hate it when tights are made this way. I would not recommend. Also they run small."
2,"Cute Design, Cheap Materials","I bought this collar for my little peekapoo puppy who is named after the old New Orleans Saints mascot. He is barely 5 pounds and was able to break the clasp with his teeth. I can understand a big dog able to do that..but not my tiny puppy. It was cute while it last, but that wasn't long at all. :("
3,a boring way to start a long battle,"Hi I just want to say this tape is somewhat boring they have to get the saga started so that's this tape if your collecting the tapes buy it if your not collecting and just buying the good one don't bother buying it.Also always get uncut if you can afford it sure it's way goryer and the language can get roughf but cut has stuff cut out . I was waching a tape that was cut and all the sudden one of freizas henchman falls down dead and you son't even know how he died.If you want a good freiza tape get the new trunks tapes thats cool (he turns super saiyin) And while your at it pick up some brand new andriod tapes with three super sayins vegeta,goku, and trunks."
3,WIND IN THE WILLOWS,I RECEIVED THE VHS TAPE IN GOOD ORDER AND WAS PLEASED WITH HOW QUICKLY IT WAS DELIVERED.
2,"Disappointing, slow and racist...","After reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to my 5 and 7 year olds, I got down my childhood copy of Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. It made for a terrible read aloud! The plot was slow, the dialogue boring and I had to edit out some racist parts about China and the Chinese. We all decided to abandon the read aloud after Chapter 5. Very disappointing! I was actually surprised to still find the book in print!"
1,THE ONLY DAHL STORY WE HAVEN'T LIKED,"I am the mother of a two children, ages seven and five. We have read and reread nearly all of Roald Dahl's children,s stories. In general, I love this author. His stories are entertaining, even magical, and so beautifully written. When reading Dahl, I am always aware that my children are exposed to high quality literature with a richness of vocabulary and ideas. Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is the only exception to our general delight with Roald Dahl. It is dark and lacks the sense of optimism, the charm, the magic of his other stories. Neither of my children enjoyed this book and I did not either. My advice would be to stop after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and not pick up this sequel. Instead, grab Matilda, the BFG, or James and the Giant Peach and treat yourself and your kids to a real treasure!"
2,What a disappointment...,"Sorry, but this book was a real disappointment after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! If you are a parent, read it first before considering it for your children- mine were bored."
5,Happy nephew!,"The book is in great condition, priced right, and arrived promptly in the mail.Oh, this worked out so nicely. My nephew was asking the grown-ups for this book and through the relative telephone line, I was able to search on Amazon and find it and for his birthday, he had it in his hands! A great feeling all around. He thinks I am a great Aunt and he is a Happy nephew!"
5,Absolutely amazing.,"Not a week passes without me listening to this c.d from beginning to end.This is a wonderful addition to any collection.Once you start listening to this artist, you become hooked and you buy her whole body of work..."
2,One size does NOT fit all!,"The product arrived used and scratched with the imprint of the previous owner's iron - I was very disappointed as I had ordered a new item from Amazon. I returned the product only to be given the same item in the same (unsealed) box. I was surprised to receive such poor customer service from Amazon.The main hesitation I had prior to ordering the ironing-mount was the fact that it did not seem to accommodate all irons. Unfortunately turns out to be true - I was hoping to use it with my new iron but it did not fit at all - the newer designed irons are far too big for it. I had to use it with my very old iron instead, which I was planning on throwing out....Overall very disappointed. If you have a small old iron and don't mind receiving a used product then this is for you."
5,One kick butt album!!!,"I love this cd!!!! My friend Kim had gotten this cd for Hanukah when I was at her house and (even though I'm Christian) I got a present too. We immediatley went to listen to her new gift. When my family and I moved from CA to TX, we stopped by a store in NM and I saw the tape she had gotten and my mom bought it for me. I listened to it so much that a year later I broke the tape due to listening to it so often! Then my dad got me the cd for my b-day along w/ the Sign and a huge sterio system. I was very excited. The song that is really kickin' is Just an Image, even though all the songs are just out of this world. 10 stars!! Boy you guys really know how to make an album!! Keep up the fab work!!!!!! love Virginia"
4,Ace of Base,"I bought this when it first came out in 1995. This CD was good. To be honest I dont listen to it any longer, and as you can see, they are not heard of that much anymore. I wonder what happened??"
3,"Setting and History Great, Mystery Not","Even though I'm rating this mystery three stars, I have to say that I enjoyed it in the way that one enjoys learning fascinating new things -- in this case, new things about violin-making and the history of violins. And in the way that one enjoys vicariously learning about a part of the Italian countryside, or Italian customs. So if you read books for the sheer pleasure of learning new things, and aren't that concerned with whether something that purports to be a mystery is really a well-constructed mystery, then you will probably enjoy this book. If you want a mystery to drive the story forward, to stay in the reader's mind, to be the thing that the whole story is about, you should probably choose a less leisurely, more mystery-crafted story."
3,Fun little horror movie. Good find.,"I bought this cause it's not available on Netflix. Pretty good movie overall. Didn't have much blood,b ut the end is actually quite creepy. Once you discover the big ""secret"" at the end, it really plays with your head. Acting was good and the music was really unsettling. Chuck D."
5,Very insightful look at religion and community,"This book was my first foray into Eliade's work and was it ever a powerful place to start. His insights into the delineation of sacred space and what it signifies for a community - repetition of the cosmogonic acts, the establishment of what is termed the axis mundi, or world center and point of contact between the heavens and the earth (as Delphi was viewed by the ancient Greeks, or Mount Meru by the Indians, etc...) and so on - are brief yet fully packed. He covers sacred time as well, with sections that tie in with another of his excellent books, The Myth of the Eternal Return.If you're interested in the study of world religions, I would highly recommend this book. In my opinion, Eliade is a standout in this area."
2,Threads stripped out...,"I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this product. There are so many things that can be done to your wheels to speed them up, and almost all of them require a wheel mandrel. The screw that holds the wheel in place stripped out after it's 3rd use!! (with many more uses still to go!) Luckily, I was able to get a replacement screw at my local hardware store in time to finish the wheel-tuning before the race. For a few extra bux, I'll be getting the Pro-Wheel Mandrel from Derby Worx for my son's next race."
2,Cute But . . .,"To fill you have to struggle to get the stopper out of the bottom. Once you get it out, you have to tape the top of the shakers or the the salt/pepper floods out. It takes a lot of effort to get the stopper back in. Then you pull off the tape off the top. As I said, they are cute . . ."
4,"From a Member of New Madrid, Missouri","From a person who lives in New Madrid, this book is very helpful. It lists all the things, you need to know. Strategies for your survival, stuff for an emergency case; food, water, toliet paper."
3,"Interesting, but...","I thought the first part of this book was fascinating. I thought it probably gave a pretty accurate picture of what the damage was likely to be, and how the damage would occur. I was looking forward to reading about the probable psychological responses to a catastrophe like this. Once I got there, I found myself nodding my head, remembering Katrina. What gave me pause was when the author cited several quotes by a Dennis Mileti. Mileti claims that looting is almost non-existent in catastrophes. ""Sociologists, in fact, have tried to interview arrested looters after over one hundred disasters, according to Mileti, but they can never find any."" I then looked at the date of publication of this book - 1989. Even so, to say that looting has almost never occurred during disasters is very hard to believe.It's not my THINGS that I care about, it's the psychological unease of bands of criminals roaming the area. I felt that should have been researched and written about a little better."
5,Evergreen,Evergreen is a family saga that takes you through the ups and downs of a family in a very interesting time in our country.After a very few pages you feel you know this family personally and it is very hard to put it down.
4,Quality Control........,"I ordered a pair of these from Amazon. At first glance, they look great. So I set them aside until the weather warms up a bit. The other day, I was moving things around and happened to pay closer attention to the packaging.That's when I noticed they were not alike. In 1 package, it has the plastic peg with the hole to tie off. In the other package, there's what looks like a plastic cap instead.....Hopefully Taylor Made makes it right. Will update if not.*edit*Just received my replacement part from TaylorMade. So I'm a happy camper."
2,Sticks have nothing to do with Bill Bruford,"I assumed these were the Bill Bruford Signature Sticks, not the case."
2,disappointing ...,"If you are looking for a book about this filly buy ""Burning from the Start"" not this one. The ""Legend.."" book contains nothing you did not know about her. It is a book about mere facts, nothing new or personal. If you are looking for a book that covers the whole story buy ""Burning from ..."". I would not buy it again."
5,"""Good evening boys and girls...""","Ah, the 1975 release of the Live Sensational Alex Harvey Band!I remember buying this album back then and I still can't let itget too far away from my turntable. These guys had their own act.I never got to see them live but DID see them on TV on ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"" and I think it was from this same tour. From the opening chords of ""Faith Healer""(my favorite)and into ""Tomahawk Kid"" right on through the rest of the tunes this album rocks, is entertaining and has excellent sound quality for a live album. If you like alternate non-commercial rock from the mid '70's get your hands on this album! Give My Compliments To The Band and all who recorded and produced this album. Another good one by them is ""The Impossible Dream"" studio release from the same era. VAMBO RULES!!"
1,Never got the download,"I followed the instructions to purchase this item but because I didn't know to setup the download site first, I never received the download and when I tried to get it to download after my setup was complete, all I could get was a message saying already downloaded."
1,"Pay for what you get, $20","This thing is a piece of junk. I got it for a small table in a walk-in closet for a place to put things. But I'm embarrassed to have this thing. The lower shelf is so thin it looks like cardboard, and the entire thing screams cheap particle board. Pay for what you get!! On the other hand, after I painted this thing black and put a new knob on it, it looks OK for a cheap table in the garage, so maybe its worth the $20. I wouldn't pay more than that for this if for some reason the cost goes up."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought two of these tables for a bedroom in our small country-style cottage home. I put them together in about 5 minutes, and they are very pretty and surprisingly sturdy for the price. Perfect for the bedroom I put them in. The only downside was the ""distressed"" look was poorly executed, but I fixed that in minutes with some sandpaper! Excellent value."
2,Damaged,This table arrived with numerous scrapes and gouges caused by poor packing. I will have to strip it and refinish it before my wife can use it. Several of the legs have splits in the wood and were puttied up to hide this. I would return it BUT the vendor requires photos sent to them before they will decide if they will give you a PARTIAL refund. As this was under $40 it is not worth the hassle and I am sure this is what the seller counts on. So in conclusion.. Unless you are a woodworker or just like refinishing furniture I would stay away from this.
3,Distress lines look drawn by a bored three year old,"The night stand came quick and easy to assemble, although the one-paged ""instructions"" were inferior to helpful. It is cheaply made, as already previewed by the price, however it is very cute, but the distress lines on the top and bottom of the stand are aesthetically a joke-- it looks like someone just took a regular Bic pen and harshly scribbled a few lines on it. I painted over the top surface, and just turned the side on the bottom surface. I think the manufacturers of this product would have a lot more satisfied customers if they took away the scratches."
5,Shabby Chic Perfection!,"This carved white side table is shabby chic perfection! It arrived in excellent condition and was easily assembled. Its sturdy, all-wood construction fits nicely with my bedrooom decor. I'm very pleased."
5,"Great ring, lots of compliments.",This ring is gorgeous and I feel like I totally lucked out. Amethyst and Garnet are my two sons birthstones so this makes the ultimate mother's ring for me without spending too much. It wears really well too. I have worn it everyday and night for months and it still looks great.
1,Very Poor Quality,"This item began to rip and tear the second I started to place the cardboard separators inside. Due to it's very poor quality, I am returning this to Amazon."
1,101st nausea,"I don't think I should write a review. If the critical energies of man and monkey are successfully generated, we will all know about the book before others have to read it. What a blessing that would be for the unexposed, sorry, the unenlightened."
2,Very Disapointed,This game was not at all what I expected. The steering wheel and pedals are just for looks. You actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel. And many of the games had nothing to do with driving. So glad I opened it to try it before Christmas morning. This is one toy that is headed back to the store.
3,Great look but no support -It's meant for -ahem- one thing only...,"Bought this as a gift for my wife. While she finds the fit as acurate and loves the look, it's not something she will wear every day as it has no support (none). It's really meant for show and not for on-the-go. She advises to get a wire support version for daily use. But if you want to impress your man, toss this one on before hitting the bed!"
4,Instep Rocket Bike Trailer,Works great. The grandchildren love it. A great value.Very light weight. Easy to fold down.Someone designed this one very well.Even has cup holders for the children.
4,A good buy,"I bought this trailer to practice my biking during the summer. It was easy to assemble and very light. The material is not as resistant as the pricier models and it doesn't have tinted sides or front panels so be prepared to improvise some shades for your child. I liked the side bars that protects the tires they saved the wheels from a ""sudden detachment"" a few times while pasing through the bike path entrances. It is really important to be aware of the whidth needed to make it through all the time. As other poeple has mentioned, the harness latches could be better and they are difficult to remove. I haven't used it as a double stroller but it doesn't have brakes so It would be a little tricky to go on a hilly ride. I've tried the trailer with two kids and it works fine and two 30 lb kids can ride pretty comfortably, the challenge will be keeping them from fighting. Cup holders form each child are a great help.In general it was a good buy for me."
3,Nice but the box was falling apart when it got here...,When I received this item it looked used. The tires were bent and there were scratches all over. So far it's held up but I would think twice before Ordering off amazon.
1,Does not attach to all bikes!,"This trailer does not attach to all bikes. Upon receipt of the product, I assembled the trailer and attempted to take it for a spin. I was extremely frustrated when I found that the trailer would not attach to my GT Avalanche 3.0. I contacted the manufacturer and they told me to return the product as there is no attachment that would fix the problem. My bike does not have an abnormal frame and I was shocked to learn that the trailer would not work. Unless you have a bike frame with a very WIDE and FLAT area where the quick release mechanism attaches to the bike, I would suggest staying away from this product. I am now looking for a trailer that will attach to the actual frame and NOT to the quick release mechanism."
4,Very Sharp,Hi I just got this paring knife a month ago and only use it a few times before leaving on a deployment. I am not a professional chef just trying to act like one. I am left handed explaining why I got a left handed knife LOL. I will say this knife is very very sharp it will slice a potato as if it was butter. My only issue and it maybe cause I have not used it often enough. Is it pulls to the middle of the potato as if it was a right handed knife. The knife does not seem to have a one sided blade so maybe I was holding it wrong. Again I only had a chance to use it a few times before leaving town.
5,THE BEST,I WANTED THESE BECAUSE THEY HAVE GREASE FITTING BUILT IN.THE ONES FROM THE FACTORY DO NOT.THEY ARE A PERFECT FIT.
3,Pro Pedestal; seats,"Received package as schedule, Seats look great, and feel okay, could use a little more padding, but it works so I would do business with this company again."
1,Muffin maker,"Wish I would have known these contain trans fats, Although its only 1 gram I would have reconsidered this purchase had the nutrition facts been noted on amazon."
1,"ZERO berries in this ""triple berry"" mix!!","If you really want berries in your muffins, go elsewhere! It's hard to see from the small picture on amazon, but this ""triple berry"" mix has only ""imitation berries"" -- i.e. collections of chemicals/food coloring to make them look like blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Yuck! If you really want ""triple berry"" muffins, try a plain blueberry muffin mix with REAL blueberries and add your own fresh blackberries and raspberries. Now THAT'S yummy!P.S. Guess I sounded overly snotty as I have only 1 helpful review out of 5! Can't figure out why the other 4 people didn't find the review useful -- if I were thinking of buying something called a ""triple berry muffin mix"" I would want to know if it really had any berries in it. This mix doesn't! Now come on, isn't that helpful to know? :-)"
2,Put it down for over a year before finishing...,"I started out really liking this book - the premise, the setting of Northern CA and the mystery...unfortunately, it lost steam midway through and I felt as though I were reading a travelogue rather than a novel. I actually skipped pages toward the end because I felt like I was reading the action in slow motion. Too descriptive! Less words to keep the plot going at a good pace would have been much better, and could have cut the pages by at least a third if not half.I have read the T2 books and enjoyed them. I have Dies the Fire and will still give it a chance. One unenjoyable book won't put me off Stirling completely."
2,"Ok story, but way too S L O W","I read the first two books of the Islands in the Sea of Time series. About halfway through the second one, it just got too boring for me. The original idea was very good, but there just wasn't much of interest beyond that. Conquistador shares a similar feel.The story wasn't bad and the characters were OK, but the dialog was bad and the book was just way longer than it should have been, packed with slow boring parts with a little action sprinkled in. I also felt like the author was trying to force in a lot of little trivia all along the way, and a lot of the time it seemed forced. Add to this an anticlimactic ending and it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.I wouldn't recommend this book. Stirling seems to have good ideas, but doesn't deliver much with them."
3,Recent book purchase,The book was not incorrectly described. I had had another book in this series and it was a much bigger book so I expected the same. My fault.
1,Boring and Homophobic,"This book is terrible. The author wastes words describing landscapes when he should be moving the plot along. Additionally, there are at least 3 homophobic remarks. Really not cool or necessary. Skip it."
4,Decent alt-history,"The plot's been summarized in other reviews, and I won't bother duplicating it. Stirling takes an old idea and executes it in an at-least-somewhat original way. He does his usual good extrapolations of well-researched technology; the man is thorough in his worldbuilding and his research, and in this book manages to keep the extensive tech extrapolations to a minimum.Well-drawn cast of characters, although as usual the antagonists are the more interesting side. I'm waiting for the sequel."
4,Nice to kick back and listen to,"My favourite song on this album is 'Who do you love'. I also love 'Sentimental'. This is a nice CD to listen to. Deborah has a beautiful voice and this was certainly a good debut. I didnt know it has the song 'Where do we go from here', so that was a nice surprise. For those who remember the 90s, this is a good addition to your collection."
5,Just the tip of the iceburg!,"Wow...those were my first words when I heard the voice of the very talented Deborah Cox. I know this has been said several times, but Deborah is no doubt the next Whitney! I believe she has just as much of a future of fame as Whitney Houston has had. The thing that really impresses me is that Deborah doesn't feel she has to dress in a slutty manner to impress her fans and listeners like several of the rising female artists of today...two thumbs up Deborah!"
2,If only the songs looked as good as she does .............,"This album announced a major new talent in music with a unique sound. Unfortunately most of the songs are ordinary and partly succeeded in hiding that talent. ""My First Night With You"" is the only song that allows her to show what her voice can do when heartfelt but restrained. I'm guessing production by Babyface is mainly responsible for that.On other tracks her fondness for Whitney Houston style vocal gymnastics makes its unwelcome presence felt, and it got markedly worse on her second album.The worst track for me is ""Just Be Good To Me"". The production here is woeful, and whoever thought Deborah could make a success out of a song that so clearly suited the completely different vocal style of Lindy Layton should not be making those kinds of decisions.I'm thankful that this album got her career started, but you wouldn't call it one of the great debuts."
3,Book editors must be in short supply.,The authors' attempt at giving the reader a feel for the physics of flight is lost in a sea of laughably poor grammar and typographic errors.My favorite error is in Figure 2.10 which shows the 'Angel of Attack' of a wing. All I can think of is 'Cherubim with an attitude'.
2,ug Author Is Not Correct,"After listening to the author speak on Science Friday, it appears that he thinks lift is the product on air being viscously ""pulled"" (accelerated) down across the top of the wing. That is totally impossible because air does not support tension (just as yarn does not support compression, or ""push"") Air fills the space above the wing surface because air pressure existing far above the wing maintains, to the extent possible, the static air pressure exerted on the top surface of the wing. Air mass/inertia prevents instantaneous space-filling above and behind the moving wing. If air had no inertia, wings would produce no lift. The True Simple Explanation of Flight: Wings experience a differential between the upper and lower surface pressures due to air inertia (air can't immediately get out of the way of the wing's bottom surface, and the air can't immediately fill the space above the wing, as the wing passes through the stationary air). Todesvogel"
4,Works just fine,"Not much to say, other than it works fine and costs less than some other putting aids out there. It is more compact than most and also doesn't limit your distance like the putting mats. If you're looking for inexpensive putting practice, this is for you."
2,Sounds like?,"For some reason I thought the sample sound clips were pretty good when I listened to them on the amazon site. Was I drunk? These two guys seem to be going for that late sixties or early seventies psychedelic sound. I'm sure these are a couple of multi talented and creative musicians evident through an occasional glimmer or spark of interest created by some of the sounds on this disc. But there is an overuse of sound effects that muddy up the musical landscape. While there is a consistency to the sound of this recording, I can't put my finger on what is going on here because it mostly just sounds like mush. There are far too many effects, like the thick reverberation, on the vocals that make the lyrics unintelligible. If there is an appeal to this music I haven't found it yet. Should I try playing this backwards? I doubt it will get much play on my sound system."
2,This book was written two years too early,"When this book was written Saban hadn't really done much. He did win the SEC Championship, but they just won the mythical national championship. NOW would have been the time to write this one. Like I said...two years too early.Try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" by Chris Warner. It's a good one."
4,"Here's to you, Soul Shadow...","I really do appreciate the gesture of helping people by telling them what they are about to buy (seriously...no sarcasm), BUT...perhaps you should read the discription...and I quote...""Dub and Sub""...yeah...thats a hard one to miss...WELL NOW, ON TO BUSINESS...this looks really great, I don't see why any anime fan wouldn't wantt to pick this up, other than the sheer magnitude of episodes. Also, the holidays are right aroung the corner...*hint hint...wink wink*..."
4,"Ah, Inuyasha's prime season!!","Inuyasha was my first anime (Otaku for THREE years here people!) and this was the season that got me into this wonderful series.In my personal opinion, this is the VERY best season. Alot of the classic moments are right in here. This is where things in the series really heat up as well. For an example, we just learn that Naraku has enough poew to create INCARNATIONS from parts of his own body!! (o.O)And for all you romantics out there, the realtionship between Inuyasha and Kagome deepens. (See episode 48. =]) Comedey is great in this season too!! ( AHAA! Miroku ,you pervert! XDD)The point is to pick up this boxed set!! ITs freakin awesome and its a must have for every Inuyasha fanatic!!! ^^"
4,It does the job.!,"I bought this ratchet to use to adjust the airflow screw on my MC carborators. There is not enough room to get a screw driver in and not enough room to use a regular ratchet. This ratchet fit nto the available space and because of the rotator handle allows me to easily turn the screw either direction. The only thing I would change is, no matter which direction you turn the rotator handle the ratchet turns the same direction."
1,Loire Valley (Eyewitness Travel Guides),I was extremely disapointed with this book. It's just pretty pictures with very little useful information.I will never buy another Eyewiness guide again.
5,The ONE book a new Linspire user must have,"The info in this book tells how to do everything a typical home user will want to do with Linspire, and how to configure and tweak things, and more important, how to resolve problems that creep up.I think any company that sells pre-installed Linspire computers would be very well served by jacking up their price $30 and including this book. For a Windows user who buys a pre-installed Linspire system for the first time, this book can be the difference between 1) frustration and regreting the purchase, and 2) a happy conversion to Linux and ALL it has to offer."
3,"Good, but not a thorough basic text.","I used this book in an upper level seminary systematic theology course. Thomas covers all the basics, but depends on a lot of apriori knowledge, so this is not a book for beginners. Also, he spends far too much time doing Anglican appologetics for us non-Anglicans/Episcopalians."
2,Not enough information,"I have read many books on the Roman civilization and sorry to say when I was reading this book the information was too condense and I could not get involved in the book as I should.The reason being he the author condensed the material and he occassionally would jump from one historian to another throwing my though process out of focus. In some regards,I tried to find what the book was really all about."
3,Pants look nothing like picture,The color and style of the pants do not match the picture. The pants that shipped were a much lighter blue than shown here. Also the bottom of the pant leg was made for cowboy boots vice a regular shoe. This made an excessive taper of the leg.
2,Poor Quality,"VHS Tape copy I received had considerable tape hiss and was ""jumpy"" in large segments of the film. Wish there had been a DVD copy available instead."
3,fairly good book,"Is a good basic book, but the format and pictures are like 30 years old. Some pictures are not clear at all."
3,Firestorm battery,"Battery seems to be new and has functioned ok so far. Only time will tell. New items tend to come in packaging with instructions for their care and use. As with any Nicad battery, a full discharge a d then a recharge may add to the life of the battery."
3,Too expensive.,Lowes sales this 18V in 2-battery-per-package for $36 only.The lowest price I have found.
2,no information,Did not need to buy this extra one but it did not state that it came with one when I bought the saw. You should put that the battery and charger comes with it. so it cost me more money because of this and now I had to pay to have it shipped it back.
4,Great to have portable power,"Yes, I wish 18V cranked up like a gas powered unit...but the balance of power and length of charge is just right.It'll keep whatever BD unit you're using going long enough for most jobs. Suggest keeping a second on the new power charger and keep on working."
4,Epitome of southern (Kentucky) cooking.,"Mr. Hougen went a long, long way in detailing the scrumptiousness of Kentucky cooking as compared to other southern cookery. It's all in there .. chicken, beef, veggies, soups ... and SPOONBREAD! You will never again taste anything like it, especially so north of the Ohio River. His recipes remain staples of the cuisine from the reknown Boone Tavern in Berea, Kentucky just south of Lexington, where the student body of Berea College exclusively are employed to meet their tuitions. Among cookbooks, this one should be a must-have."
1,How can I review this product....,"... when I never received it? I've e-mail this fact twice. IT NEVER CAME IN THE MAIL! and yet I was billed for it.This will be my last Amazon purchase unless I get some satisfaction.Dave HintonPaxton, IL"
5,The power of flower!,A wonderfully informative and thought provoking book. I had no idea there was so much to learn about the health benefits of fresh flour. This book is a must for everyone concerned about living a healthy lifestyle.
2,Something's missing...,"Block's stories receive wonderful praise, but after reading just the first book in this collection, I've got to ask ""Why?"" Yes, the prose is beautiful, sprinkled with sentences that are magic. But I put the book down feeling like something was lacking. The writing is too detached from the characters and story, choosing instead to focus on fantastical descriptions of a picture-perfect Hollywood where clouds are made of cotton candy. I found it hard to relate to Weetzie, Dirk, etc. when I only had the briefest glimpse of who they are. They start in high school, then are suddenly living on their own, with boyfriends, having babies. How did that happen? I wanted some more insight into the characters to make them seem more like real, relatable people, not puppets controlled by the author with no inner thoughts or feelings."
5,beautiful book,"You don't have to be a fan of feathered friends to enjoy this book... you just have to have an eye and appreciation for beauty. The photography is stunning and the chickens are unbelievably majestic and interesting. I highly recommend it for those in the design field who are looking for inspiration, asyou will find it on these pages!"
2,"Beautiful Pictures, Almost Useless For Information","Looking for a book to give me more information about various chicken breeds, I took a chance on this book. My children love it because there is no writing. The entire book is images of chickens, and there are tiny notes to indicate the breed...but not the sex of the pictured chicken, and NO breed traits, characteristics, stats at all. The images are beautiful overall, and it's not a bad coffee table book if one is in the mood for chickens...just know that it is nothing more than a picture book."
5,Gorgeous photos of gorgeous chickens!,"Great book for people who love chickens! It's all photos, with very little to actually read, so don't buy it looking for information. But if you enjoy looking at amazing breeds of chickens, you'll love this (I'd love to see his pictures in a book about chickens as pets--few people appreciate the affectionate, endearing, and comical nature of these birds). If you DON'T like chickens you will probably find the pictures somewhat horrifying, as some breeds are really strange-looking (think the chicken equivalent of bulldogs or shar-peis, or other weird ""purebred"" mutations). This is a really fun book by an extremely talented photographer."
1,Old Old Old ideas,Poorly written......... very old ideas..... worked back in the 50's but not today. Companies need a fully collaborative approach to planning based on a solid business strategy or supply chain specific strategy not a master schedule only based on internal bias only.
5,This book will teach you to focus on your strengths!,This book changed my way of thinking. Helped me prepare for an interview -I got the job!
3,Interesting 'listen'; author should take his own advice,"Listened to the audio (CD) version. Interesting; online test was OK, too.For the future, Author Buckingham should take his book's advice about playing to one's strengths. Mr. B. is probably an OK author but the role of 'narrator' is NOT one of his strengths. Next time hire an actor whose strengths/skills match the job.As an audio/video producer, I know there is no shortage of professional actors whose talents bring 'life' to the content of authors and similar experts.Maybe next time..."
2,Buyer beware,"I read reviews about this book before I purchased it and many warned buyers that they should buy the book new, as there is a one-use password to take the test online. Once the password has been used once, it cannot be reused.I made sure I purchased the book new. It looked new when I received it. Yet, when I went online to take the test and I entered the passcode I found inside the flap of my book, the system said that the password had already been used. So, someone had already accessed that particular password.I gave the review 2 stars because I still got a bit of useful information from the book, but without having my personal results for the online test, most of the book was of little use to me."
3,Good Management Text,"The strength of ""Now Discover Your Strengths"" lies not with discovering one's own strenghts (mine were all self-obvious), but in learning to manage the strengths of others and in providing the concept of a ""strengths-based organization"". The book recommended numerous useful strategies for managing people who exhibit each of the various traits/strenghts and in providing strategies for creating a strenght-based organization.For learning better how one's personality relates to one's career, try ""Do What You Are"", a more self-insightful personality text."
1,Snake oil for the 21st century! Step right up!,"What a joke! What a huge waste of money and time! I could take the survey mutiple times (if it's possible...which it's not) and come up with completely different lists of my so-called ""Top Five"" strengths.A 1 star rating is 1 star too many for this presumptuous, pretentious psychobabble.There's one born every minute and Marcus Buckingham is waiting to take your money."
1,Content is good but no option for online delivery - Not good!,The content is worthwhile and I would have definitely provided a higher rating (likely a 4).However I am baffled as to why the publisher does not offer a kindle version. And even worse there is no option to take the Strengthfinders test (which is mandatory for understanding the material) if you have purchased a used book or were given the book from a friend or colleague.Gallup should be doing its part to improve the environment and reduce their footprint.
4,Very Insightful,"I like this book because the authors based it on a scientific study of gallup poll questionaires of great managers. They spotted patterns in them. All of these managers honed their strengths and worked around their weaknesses. This book is a no BS analysis of what you need to do to excel. And it doesn't include focusing on your negatives. Instead, make your talents into strengths!"
4,"Needed new, excellent condition","I required for this book to be delivered quickly and brand new as the cover has a code on it that was required for a class I'm taking. The code is then used as part of the reading for an online evaluation of the reader. The book appeared to be brand new, excellent condition. The seller did a great job. The code on the book didn't work and I had to notify the website of the problem. It was corrected within a day and all was well."
2,WARNING This book is only a manual for a software tool that you might not be able to get,"You'll go page after page wondering when the content is going to start. It starts when you log into a site, using the registration number in the book, and take a test. You cannot use the number if it has been used before, which means that -all- the used books offered here are completely worthless.As far as the idea is concerned, it makes sense to have an outside analysis of what you might be good at, if you suspect that you have some undiscovered talent.But the book is a hoax, in that it is only the minor part of what it promises, and you'll likely spend your money before you find out that you won't receive the major part."
4,worth it,"This book is worth purchasing just for the Strengthfinder online ""test"". I've been through these types of assessments before-- this was by far the most insightful & helped me understand WHY I work the way I do. It has helped to keep me on track in capitalizing on my individual strenghts. Now I don't view my ""quirks"" as impediments. I understand that these are the motivating factors that keep my work ethic afloat.Of course, knowing the strengths of your boss will help you respond & react to him/her in the most productive way. And with subordinates, you'll be able to help them work in a way that is more gratifying to them, which will sustain their morale & most likely generate a lot of new ideas for your workplace.Buy it for yourself, and some for co-workers. Then share your Strengths!(Once you get your online assessment, you can also sign-up to receive for Strength-specific tips on a regular basis!)"
1,do not buy used...,"There is a code that you need and it can only be used once, therefore this book is completely useless after the first 3 chapters."
2,"Interesting, not compelling","So, people can't change their basic personalities. We've heard this before. So, build on people's strengths. We've heard this before too. If the HR people listen to this, maybe it will help the corporate world, once they understand that diversity is more than race, religion, politics, etc... The strengths test is interesting, my top five were facets that show in my personal life (the bookish little nerd liberal arts major) much more than in my professional life (hard Harvard MBA). What is missing is how to apply this insight...what the particular combination of strengths means, how to communicate with and lead people with differing strengths, etc., etc. Perhaps I am expecting too much, since I am basing my expectations on the Myers-Briggs and other personality tests with larger data and research bases....."
1,Not as advertised!!!,"I would have gave this a 0 out of 5 if I could have. I recently bought this book, ""brand new"" and when I went to register the access code on the Clifton website I received this message,""The following error(s) occurred:* The access code you entered has already been registered or is invalid. Please enter an unused and valid access code or re-enter this code if you think you may have mistyped it.""Save yourself the hassle plus money in purchasing a new book with an access code and do *NOT* buy from this seller in the belief that it is new!"
3,Sorry,"I got this book as a self help book, and did not realize that it was more for business aplication"
5,Valuable tool... even if you have been through similar books,"Buckingham helps shift one's perspective.. so although much of the material is not ""new"" or earth-shattering, ""reframing"" the process of assessing our strengths and skills I found to be a valuable exercise."
1,Disappointment,The web site access code was missing from the book. This code was needed to connect the information in the book to you. Very disappointed.Amazon.com purchase.
3,"A free, second test is available if you ask for it.","This book ""locks up"" any one else's opportunity to take the test as soon as the code provided is used once. Their web site provides a help number where you can obtain a free second code for a family member, which is an annoyingly un-advertised option which no one knows unless you call and forcefully complain. Bah. This is hardly professional. The test seems fairly right-on; although the results were no surprise, the authors' phrasings of strentghs and their characteristics are insightful, and useful within a process of self-understanding. The book would rate probably a bit more star if the authors were not so stingy as to how many tests were available per book."
1,I want my money back,"I purchased this music expecting to be able to put it on my i pod, but I can't and I can't talk with anyone who might be able to help me. I am not very good with computer stuff. There may be a way to do it, but I can't figure it out. The music is probably fine, but not much good when i can't get it onto my i pod."
5,Tops,I love Jeeves and Bertie Wooster. Everybody should have a Jeeves to rely on. Bertie not as lame as Aunt Agatha claims.
3,Classic - but not all Jeeves stories,"This is classic P.G. Wodehouse, and everyone who likes his stuff will like this book. However, not all the stories are Bertie Wooster & Jeeves; and personally, I find silly twits by themselves, unredeemed by Jeeves, to become a bit tiresome after a time.But pleasant, light entertainment."
4,"Cute, but I wouldn't want a whole diet of Bertie Wooster","Amusing but without chapter breaks it tends to run together. Everyone must have a Jeeves story in their library. I've got mine, enjoyed it, and will now move on."
2,Perhaps you have to be British,"Perhaps you have to be British to ""get"" the humor that this book is said to possess. Perhaps even better to have read it in the 1920s. I found it just ""much ado about nothing."""
1,The only book on Mariner's Compass Quilts you'll ever need.,"I have many, many quilting books in my library, and buy new ones as I can but I doubt I'll ever buy another Mariner's Compass book! This book has it all, from gorgeous photos to clear, concise instructions on all aspects of these stunning quilts including full sizes patterns. Or draft your own patterns with Judy's easy to understand (even for someone who doesn't ""do"" math"" ;-). Highly recommended!"
5,Happy,"have started picking my fabric, can't wait to start making one. I love this quilt. The Mariner's Compass is a very pretty quilt."
2,Terrible Translation!,"The book itself is really interesting, but the translation is so bad as to be almost unreadable. I'm not quite sure how it even got published. Buy it in Spanish if possible!!"
4,Very great,When i ordered this gun i was told that it was out of stock so i instead got a gun from the 304 series and i love it. it shoots nice and feels and looks very durable. shipping was fairly fast. My only concerns/problems are that the trigger has to be pulled back very far which makes it so you can shoot as fast but this isn't much of a problem. The other this is that the puncture screw feels and looks very flimsy. overall i love it though.
3,Bitter truth,"I read this book in 1969 when my mother taught the author's daughter piano. I was a senior in High School in Daytona Beach, FL. This book was very enlightening and hard to take at some points. The story of Mr. Vining's life during the war years was a story of true courage and horror. He told of the atrocities men suffered at the hands of a Godless people who knew no mercy. His story of survival is an inspiration and a call to courage in the face of adversity. Thank God for people who faced their memories and told what they endured during that period of the 1940's."
5,Better living,I'm glad that the book will be back in print. It's been a real blessing for me. I've purchased many different types of grain online and have been treating my family (and extended families) to wonderful breads and other baked items. I made stew and put in some crumbs from the whole wheat bread that I made to thicken the soup. It did a wonderful job and I feel good about using the whole grains another way. Check out this book if you want to eat/live better.
1,mostly asterisks,"the work in this book is an example of why poetry is marginal and going to remain that way. Kelsey is more interested in white space than in language, which means that not only the pages but the poems themselves are empty. I tried reading the poems aloud to see if that gave them any more substance, to see if there was something compelling about the actual sounds that silent reading didn't evoke, but unfortunately, there's not much music to found in these poems. There are, however, many, many asterisks--the book is littered with them. And like the lines of letters and words Kelsey arranges, they're symbols of lack you really just skip over. Skip the book too."
1,The Law is a Lady,I did not like this book. It was very hard to get into from the beginning. I would not recommend this book to my friends.
4,Review,Good book. I enjoyed it very much. Like the author very much. Very easy read. Will read another of this author.
1,Not As Advertised,"When I ordered this plug, I expected it to be in one piece. However, the casing was separate from the 3.5 mm plug and I was unable to successfully insert the plug into the casing. Consequently, I sent this item back. Thus, this item is not recommended."
1,doesn't work with my Mac,"After weeks of troubleshooting I have given up. Cannot get my Mac to recognize the device (at least not as anything resembling a scanner.) It can apparently scan, or at least recognize a barcode enough to produce a ""beep"", but only once, and without any readout on screen, and the scanner then turns itself off immediately."
3,Does not work for us,The application we are using needs a port and could not get this to work in Windows 7 . I probably should have dug deeper before buying.
1,Dud,Product dead on arrival.Unable to get through to anyone at telephone or e-mail customer service.Returned for refund.
1,Junk...,"I would not recommend this to anyone. I got this thinking it would come with all the normal features all of the other scanners did (i.e. thick manual that had different options, such as lower case, etc...) Sent it back because I couldn't use it at all... The manual that it came with was only a few pages and no advanced settings.Also, if you try to get support over the phone or via email... it won't help. They do not respond to multiple emails and phone calls. The people that made this product are Adesso.com. Will not purchase their cheap junky products in the future.PS - I normally do not like to write bad reviews, I just had to let everyone know how bad this scanner was..."
3,not as catchy as gizmodgery,"This album is good, but it just doesn't hook me in as much as gozmodgery did. maybe i need to give it more listens, but this CD just didnt have a song equivalent to ""ilovetoloveyourlovemylove""."
4,SAIKANO,"This is the only show I've been able to watch all in one sitting.The English dub work is wonderfully bad, with a charm I just couldn't help but like. About a fifth of the scenes will feature someone crying, someone dying, or someone crying over someone dying. I laughed, cried, cheered, bawwwwed, raged, and I enjoyed every minute of it."
5,What a wonderful story,"Set in a potential modern Japan, at first one would presume this is just another Japanese High School story, about love and relationships. Until the end of the first episode. In the second half of the first episode we are shown some violence and action in a graphic nature."
4,Scream if you Don`t buy It!!,"MAN,SHE`S HOT!SHE JUST DISAPEARED FOR A WHILE BUT SHE DID COME BACK WITH A GREAT BODY AND A NEW STILE OF MUSIC.SHE`S GETTING HER OWN STILE AND LEAVING THE SPICE GIRL`S OLD SHADOW BEHIND.SINCE THE SELFTITLE SCREAM IF YOU WANNA GO FASTER TILL THE AUTO BIOGRAPHIC BEING GERI HALLIWELL SHE KEEPS THE RYTHM IN THE BRITSH WAY..."
4,The best import album you'll ever buy...,"I bought this album in the UK, and it really is brilliant. Its everyhing you ever wanted from the UK Club scene rolled into 2 CD's. Its, the culmination of popular songs from the clubs of Ibiza to the UK charts. Any Americans into the club music of the UK should definately buy this CD... its not the best Kiss album the radio station has ever released but it sure does contend with the other compilation albums of this year."
1,"Awesome game, but bad CD!","Do not buy this CD unless you have Win 3.1 or 95. If you have XP, NT or 2000, expect problems with this software. Expect the ""Unable to link to KERNEL32.DLL"" error and more. Get the SNES version instead."
5,A kids review,"This is a very cool game. It was a little hard at first, but once you were finished training it got easier. I recommend this for kids that know how to read because there is a lot of reading to do. You can go shopping. You can do contests with your dogs, not to mention that you earn money from them. This is one of the best games ever made."
2,Dogs.........,"I have always wanted a dog. I wanted a cute little sheltie so much! So when I saw this game, I was really happy! I got the chihuahua one because it has a sheltie on it. (: It was fun at fist. I got my sheltie and named it Julie. I fed her... Trained her... Took her for walks. Got new collars and stuff. But then came the day my dream came true... I got a real, live, sheltie named Sadie. After that I didn't play my dog game so much... I was too busy playing with my real dog. This game is absolutely great for someone who doesn't have a real dog. But if you have a real dog already, there is no point in getting this game."
5,The first pet simulator that really explores pet ownership,"First off, some of the reviews on this product is astonishing, this game's rating is being brought down because of senseless opinions, not on gameplay. This is a game, it has nothing to do with adopting homeless pets from the shelter, someone could say the same thing about the Sims. So if you played the Sims should you go out and adopt a homeless person or adopt a child? This game was created to bring joy to the person who plays it, I would even recommend it for anyone who is thinking about owning a pet, but don't want to get in over their heads. Some people are allergic to dogs, so this is a great way to ""pretend"". It is a very innovative and thoughtful game, I see that a lot of time and study of canine personality went into the development process. I think this game is wonderful and I hope to see more from this genre of games, you definitely will not be disappointed!"
5,ALMOST THERE,"Well i got the game(Chihuahua version).... now all i need is the DS!!!!! I wanted this game soo much that i bought it to make sure it didn't run out of stock at the store. with my luck i got the last one. anyaway i have read all the reviews on this game and most of them are great. i mean overall almost 5 stars out of 292 reviews thats must be a good game. i might get the DS on X-mas... or maybe sooner. i know that this review isn't really helping you but it must be an exellent game if somebody bought the game before the DS right??? this is probbably the closest you will ever get to getting a real puppy.... of course nothing can replace the real thing. but if you can't get one for whatever reason this is the game for you. as soon as i get my DS i'll write a real review.well have fun.Lexie, age 12"
5,help me!!!!!!,"remember me! the girl said who was gonna buy a ds and nintendogs well i did! and its perfect, i got a girl husky and named it sasha as you see i played my friends at school and you probably saw that review too! anyway its awsome i taught her to sit, paw, lie down, and roll over but its my second day!! the mic really suprised me by how good it is and touch screen is like magic! nintendogs has so much you can do! give a bath, feed, play with over 100 toys, go on walks, go to the gym, or go to contests and so much more! my dog is now in the opens obiedience class!!! it rocks my dad and mom are so awsome for buying it but someone out there with chihuahua and friends i want a chihuahua but i have dashhund and friends please try to be in bark mode so i can unluck it or give a tip on how to unluck!!!!"
5,This will NEVER go PSP,"First off I am only giving it 5 stars so it will not make its rating go down. I myself have only played it once at Target, but I couldnt play it that much. My birthdays next week and I dont know if I should buy it. I like star wars, the jak games, and of course destroy all humans, but i just got a new pupy that is one of the ones on this game. Should I buy it? And buy the way this wont go psp because its called NINTENDOdogs. Sony might make something like petstation or sonydogs."
4,best dvd evre,worth the money spent for this dvd love it love it.have watch it so many times i lost track. would recommend to all reggae lovers. am getting the cd version of this.
1,Nice Desktop Replacement - Terrible Support,Don't buy the P25 if you want mobile computing. The battery life is short and the screen will be too dim to work comfortably unless you use the High Power setting which REALLY eats up the battery.There is no way to operate the P25 in a car or plane. Power inverters DO NOT WORK with the P25 (I have tried 4) and the 19 volt input requirement rules out cigarette lighteradapters.Tech support is in Turkey. Very pleasant people but it takes a long time to get a problem resolved. They don't seem to know this product very well. You will need them however because the on-board documentation (pdf) is awful. Example - I still haven't found the instructions for burning a CD.I expected much more from Toshiba!
4,"""Straight Bangin""","If you want some music to bang your head to, this is the cd you must have. Production is phenomenal. This is a vintage Warren G album."
5,The Ultimate BEST Baby Book,"I'm am so glad to find this darling little journal here at amazon.com. I purchased it for my first two babies (1996 & 1998) at local bookstores but have been unable to locate it since. With baby #3 due next month,I was about to give up hope on finding it again. The reason I like this book enough to want to use it three times in a row is that it has a really open format that allows you to create areas for baby momentos that are important to you. My biggest ""peeve"" with traditionally formatted baby books is all the blank lines to fill in! I am not that organized of a person to record every detail of baby life that the book thought to make a blank line for-- my children would have been destined to blank pages! This book has a lovely nuetral color scheme, classic photo backdrops on many pages and is spirally bound to accomodate a lot of momentos. I reccomend it for any new little baby!"
5,"If a creationist reviewer, then will flat-earthers be next?",Why give the spotlighted review of this fine book to a creationist? I'm sure flat-earthers could find objections to it too. Would you include those too?
1,Ouch,At 599.00 a can I think Ill pass. Not sure whats in it but I will go with activia and have some car repair.money left over.
1,"No more, please",I can't believe I bought this. I want my money back and the hour of my life that I spent listening to it. DON'T BUY THIS!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!
3,Needs More Christmas Episodes,Since this DVD shows a Christnas themed picture on the cover it would have been great to have 4 Christmas themed episodes.All the episodes on this DVD(including the one Christmas episode) have been shown on the Dora TV series.We all know that Dora has a baby brother and sister but since they were first introduced this spring they have only been in 3-4 episodes.The Dora series needs to have some new life breathed into it.Even my 27 month granddaughter is beginning to tire of the same episodes being shown constantly.
1,Not Dora Christmas,I was VERY dissapointed to see that only the first episode was about christmas. i thought i was buying a dora christmas movie or atleast 3-4 episodes about christmas!!!!
5,Best cleaner on the market,"I read how the Hoover SteamVac with Spin Brush series was the best carpet cleaner on the market so I decided to give the F5906-900 a try. Got it at WalMart for $139.95. This cleaner is amazing. It removed stains from our carpet that multiple stain removers in a bottle could not get out. Very easy to use, carpets dry fast and you can clean about 500 sq ft on one tank of water. This model is the best for the money however if you want to upgrade to one of the higher models of SteamVac's i'm sure the spinning brushes in the power hand attachment of the other models would be worth it. This model comes with a hand cleaning attachment that sprays cleaner and has stationary brushes. Worked great, even without the spinning brushes. I've used a lot of professional carpet cleaning services and the Hoover seems to match the quality of a professional carpet cleaner so I probably won't be needing one again."
5,Maxxima Ultra Bright Red Light LED Flashlight,"This flashlight is very well made of quality materials. My wife even likes it which is quite a ringing endorsement since she's not a flashlight nut like me. The light has an effective cone range of about 20 feet. At night, this light is very useful for astronomy and other nighttime activities. The light is very bright red with a slight orange tint and is emitted through a unique lens that seems reminiscent of a honeycomb. There are three concentric O rings near the lens end that I think are used for traction and maybe even a small degree of shock absorption. It feels good in the hand and is very sturdy. I highly recommend this light."
4,Will keep taking it,"I take it for shrinking my fibroids. So far I have taken it for over a month. 2 times a day and 3 capsules each time. I have not seen any big improvement yet. But I believe if we take it for a longer period of time, the condition will improve and we will benefit from it anyway."
3,Could have been better,A quick overview of John Wayne's movies. Brought down by poor picture reproduction and print so small it was almost illegible.
5,Awesome!,"I just recently re-visited this audio while at the gym- -on a treadmill.I had thought I knew how good this cd was, but I was shocked by how relevant, and unpredictable, and TRUE all of it was, the second time around. Deep insight into my own life. Mesmerizing!"
3,"Lots about the Aluetians, not much mystery though","My husband and I are both big fans of the Kate Chugak series. We both came away disappointed with this installment. The problem is pretty basic. In the other books in this series, the mystery is the core of the book and the setting is the frosting on the cake. The mix is seriously reversed in this book, which is fine if you really want to learn about the Aluetian Islands. It's not so hot if you want a page turning mystery.Bottom line -- if you really like reading your mysteries in order, this is worth reading since the horrors of the crab boat are referred to often in later books. Otherwise, don't go out of your way to find this book."
5,Another great mystery by Dana Stabenow,"Number 3 in the Kate Shugak mystery series, this book is set in the Aleutian Islands. I enjoyed the plot and felt immersed in the diffucult and dangerous life on a fishing boat. I greatly enjoyed the interaction between Kate and the elder, Olga.Dana Stabenow again sparked my curiousity about Alaskan history, leading me to research and learn more about the Aleutian Islands and the battles that took place there in WWII. It's wonderful that she included a reference to a good historical writer on the subject."
5,Dead in the Water,"Shugak is ""Wonder Woman"" for sure. Best Shugak mystery to date. Looking forward to see what Dana will do to top this one!"
4,A mystery to solve.,"I started reading Dana Stabenow since I received my first kindle e reader, up untill then I had not read any of her books, fell for Kate Shugak as a character, I now buy all of kate shugak series, this was not my favorite as it put her on a fishing boat, and I figured out who done it right away, but it was full of interesting insights into Alaska and her life there."
5,Deeeelicious,"I have used this product for years but for some reason it is just no longer available in stores. It has a long shelf life too! I am not really lazy but at the same time I appreciate the effort this product saves me. I have a family that really likes boiled fluffy frosting and this is just as good as home made from scratch. However, if I am frosting a big cake I prefer to use two boxes. One may seem plenty but it usually ""goes back"" a little. I like a high, high, topping for party appeal.I was just thrilled to find this available at Amazon. I would bet that most of today's cooks have NEVER made a boiled frosting, and those that have, may have had to try a few times to get it just right. Too much beating and it goes to sugar. Too little beating and it fails to reach its proper consistency. Weather plays a factor too----hot weather and humidity can affect results. A box mix for this is a great way to go."
5,Just like the old product!,"I ordered this product for my mother who frequently bakes cakes...let's just say I will be ordering more soon. Good product, great price! Thx!"
3,Good,"I enjoyed what was presented. I wanted more though. I liked the interviews but I was more drawn in by the sessions. Each group represented different aspects of Irish music. If you have ever been curious about Irish music and its roots, then this is required watching."
5,great book,"I have a collection of around 40 books on investing, so far this one is the best. It is technical, yet fairly easy to read, and more importantly it makes since."
5,Perhaps THE best investing book for laypeople,"I'm an investment advisor.I recommend this book to all laypeople who want to self-educate.In my opinion, this may be the best investing book for laypeople ever written.The first part was kind of thick, in my opinion (it is about history of investing and the risk/reward tradeoff). But if you slog through those first few dozen pages, you will be richly rewarded by the rest of the book.Only other books that come close to this book, in my opinion, for self-education of laypeople are:- Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by Bogle, and- A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Malkiel"
4,Good general concepts...can be inaccurate at times,"The author makes a worthy stab at reviewing the topic of investing, its theory, history, psychology, and business practices. For the most part, this is a good book for the beginner and intermediate investor. With the right level of attention, it could leave the reader with a road map for the future which would be solid enough.But, the author gets a little too passionate about his arguments and points more than once, and overstates his case. Since the book is written for a novice investor, this is a dis-service. Also, the book has some inaccuracies and inconsistencies, none of which are fatal, but some are material.Finally, the author tries to run the reader through some asset allocation examples - which turn out to be overly complex on the one hand, and simplistic on the other.All in all, a good book, but should only be a starting point for the curious investor."
5,Does the Job,"This is a very simple item, which does its job of protecting you from the heat of the Lodge skillet's handle. I thought I'd just use a pot holder but am glad I bought this as I don't have to worry about accidentally touching a searing hot pan handle (especially since all my other pans don't conduct heat, it would be easy to forget if distracted)."
5,You can't go wrong,"These are great quality and really protect you from heat. They slip on easily and make for a comfortable grip, too. What more is there to say? You can't go wrong."
3,"Can you put a penny next to every picture, Amazon?","So, this is hilarious. I ordered this handle mitt thinking it was a regular sized oven mitt. When it arrived in the mail, I thought Amazon made some sort of mistake. I mean, I could only get two fingers inside this thing. I actually, for a second, considered trying to use it as an oven mitt--""Maybe I can just buy six more..."" Anyways, it'd be awesome if Amazon had a picture of a penny or a regular-sized oven mitt next to every picture so us uncareful readers could get a sense of scale.P.S. Does anyone want to buy a mini oven mitt for their kid/pet?"
2,Not what I wanted,"I meant to get a regular oven mitt. Should have paid closer attention to the ""Handle Mitt"" part of the title. This item seems a little pointless to have. It doesn't really bend at all. It seems really small too. It wouldn't fit on the handle of our pan. So it would only fit on a small handle basically."
3,"Good for heat, bad if left on","If you simply use this to move a hot pan and take it back off, it's fine. I made the mistake of leaving it on the pan while cooking and it actually began to melt at the end. I have a gas range, and either the flames were a little high or the heat transferred to this - either way BE CAREFUL when using this - and don't leave it on while cooking."
4,"High-quality, high-tech heat protection","When buying my Lodge skillet, I debated about buying this Max-Temp Handle mitt, and now I'm happy I bought it. As a professional quilter, I was unsure if it was worth it to spend $6 on something I could easily make myself. Adding this small accessory qualified my order for free shipping, which is always a good thing. Plus, the mitt is made from a variety of high-tech, heat-resistant materials that are obviously more expensive to produce and acquire. The mitt is a little loose side to side and a little short front to back, but I still think it works great. The construction and materials are top quality, and there is a little hanging loop built into the side for easy storage. Overall, the product seems to deliver everything it claims, and it's also capable of withstanding higher temperatures than competing products."
4,Works well,"This handle mitt works pretty well, and is thick so you can barely feel the heat through it. I haven't had them long though, so I can't comment on the durability. So far, so good."
5,Small but mighty,"It's definitely worth getting this little handle mitt for the cast iron skillets. It is very effective for its size. It works better than most standard oven mitts and is far more convenient than constantly reaching for a standard oven mitt and far better insulated. For average cooking, it can even be left on the handle while cooking. If you're going to buy cast iron skillets, definitely get one for each pan."
1,Lit on fire,"This handle cover seemed to work for a week or so, then today it lit on fire. I guess this one just doesn't stand up to the heat."
5,Works great,"I feel no heat through this when I use it. I leave it on while I'm cooking on the stove top so I don't accidentally grab the horribly hot handle, and this thing is cool as a cucumber. I have several and love them! I have not tested the cheaper ones in the two pack, but these are reasonably priced."
2,Dragon puzzle,"Not my favorite puzzle. The image isn't as crisp as it should be, the colors are all very similiar, and after four days of puzzling I only had the border done. Too hard due to the similiar colors and lack of crispness."
5,Wonderful book!,"This is a very nice book for all all ages. Kids have fun looking at the pictures, then turning out the lights to see the bones glowing in the dark. Wonderful book!"
5,1st Album Ever Purchased,"Let's Get Serious was the first album I purchased! I was eleven and thought I had gone to heaven when I listened to this gem. So sorry I gave it to my brother when I ""grew up"". Hope it is re-released because $237 is too rich for my blood. Would love to have it again. Wish Jermaine would have continued to write and perform."
4,Great Buy,Great product.The quality of the Cookware is excellent and will recommend any one to purchase this reasonably priced set.
1,Terrible Product,"I bought this thing 7 months ago & it doesn't clean the pool. It's hard pipe design, doesn't let it get around in the middle of the pool & also gets itself tangled into knots. The pipe just came apart in the pool yesterday, so now I have to go buy a new pool cleaner. Very expensive product that doesn't work at all!!!!"
1,Don't buy it,"The Phantom is overpriced and really poorly designed. We just had ours replaced after basically every part of it (hose, housing, wheels, jets) had broken - our pool expert (NOT a Leslie's employee pushing the Phantom) confirmed that the issues we had occur widely among his other customers and shared some other horror stories.We also had similar problems to Franklin, where the Phantom would get twisted up and generally stuck in anything even closely resembling a corner...We ended up switching to the Polaris 380 instead. We had a Polaris model at our last house and were really happy with it, based on initial results I'm very happy with our decision."
5,A-TOWN BIG OOMP Running thangs pt. 1,"DJ Jelly and MC assault are the best rap producers I know today. The A-town is hildin it down fo real. This album only has a few tracks but it's still tight and should be up there with other famous rap stars. If you want a bass compilation, go get this album. Hold it down Big Oomp. Don't stop it."
4,Fun way to plan future flights!,"My husband was very excited when he opened this book for Father's Day. It is well written and easy layout to find places to go. some destinations are forced with a place to eat (White Castle, for example) however overall, fun book!"
5,"Everything I've always wanted to know, but was too young to understand","The review title really says it all. I love sixties music and I've read a lot about the counter-culture, but this book really hits the spot."
1,"Lame, not funny","I thought this was going to be a book more about actual uses for turds. Turns out, this is just a comic book. It's nothing more than a bunch of ink drawings of silly uses for turds. Most of them impractical."
3,Very small to size,"I realize that ""comforters"" are meant to be used with a bedskirt (and this comes with a plaid bedskirt, and pillow sham that matches the comforter) -- but I ordered a twin size, and it barely drops down far enough on the two sides and end of the mattress to reach the bedskirt. It's extremely thick and stiff. Too thick. It doesn't drape down the side of the bed, but rather, sticks out. For the money, and the name brand, I'm very disappointed."
2,Sounds funerary to my ears . . .,"The music while beautiful, seems very sad. It is not uplifting to me and is actually rather depressing. I bought the CD based upon the reputation of the Gordons and now wish I had shopped around more before purchasing this one. I have some of their other works that I like. But, yes, do listen to the samples before purchasing."
3,Big Time - Whigfield,"German CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""BIG TIME"" - WHIGFIELD1) Big Time (Album Version) - 3:212) Big Time (Summer Zone Remix) - 5:183) Big Time (Dancing Divaz Club Mix) - 6:544) Big Time (MBRG Remix) - 4:505) Saturday Night (US Classic Vocal Remix) - 7:156) Close To You (Album Version) - 4:071995"
4,works as expected,"Works as expected, bent the connection for my speaker system, i use this to compensate now as the bent wire creates a lot of white noise when plugged in directly to my computer."
2,Overly Complex,"I am an experienced VB6 programmer so I thought I could skip the ""Beginning"" edition from Wrox. I went onto this ""Professional"" edition. Boy was that a mistake. While I could follow the concepts in the book, they were presented in a very overly-complex manner. It seemed the authors (and there were a lot of authors) tried to present the most complex scenario they could think of for each topic. But then did not give any ""real-world"" cases where you would ever use all of the complexity and nuances discussed. They could have made the code examples much more direct and to the point without trying to confuse the reader. I think I could have gotten a basic skillset from the Beginning book and picked up anything else I needed through development. Also this book is absolutely filled with errors. Even the index is complete garbage, you have to download a corrected one from Wrox.com. I don't want to carry a bunch of loose pages around with the book as a side-bar."
2,Not what I had hoped,"After reading ""VB.NET For Developers"" I was looking for something to take me the next step. This wasnt the book. It seamed that all of the authors did not work together to come up with a concise guide. There is a great deal of content on different topics but not meaty enough to merit the title and I felt lots of duplication (Should have expected with so many authors). My recommendation is to pick up either the ""VB.NET For Developers"" book or the Dan Appleman book. And wait for a true Professional VB.NET book in several months."
2,You might skip this one...,"In my opinion, I don't feel this was a very well written book. It is quite prevalent that the book was pieced together by many different authors (as the cover implies), and in the true spirit of WROX, I am somewhat disappointed. While I did like the code samples (being a visually motivated learner), the inconsistency between chapters and examples was somewhat perplexing."
1,Trust not trustworthy,"I filled out the trust form, and a friend had a trust attorney in another state look at it. He told me it was a confusing document and not to use it, and at no charge, gave me an outline of what should have been written. Do not bother with this book."
3,Not for Louisiana,"Because of Louisiana's Napoleonic Law, this book can not help anyone living here. I went through the book a bit anyway and it seems to have a lot to offer, just not to me. I went back through the description and it does not let you know this point before you get it, very disappointing. Maybe I should know this, but then why would I need help from a book if I did."
1,Total piece of JUNK!,"I have owned this unit for almost a year. It has given me nothing but problems from the beginning. I think all the problems with this unit boil down to the software. This unit actually has an operating system like Windows. But I am not talking about Windows XP, it's more like Windows 1.0. It crashes and freezes constantly. It has so many glitches it would take me pages to describe all of them. Just don't buy this unit. For my part I will never buy another RCA product. I have owned a few RCA products in the last 10 years and all of them have been pieces of junk. The bad thing about this unit is that you cannot even ask to exchange it for a different model because the DRC8335 is the only VCR/DVD-R combo that RCA has ever produced. Mine has died for the second time and I am now struggling with throwing it in the garbage or warranting it out again only to suffer another couple months of frustration."
3,Doc Savage Man of bronze,"I purchased this movie as a gift for somebody else.I did not see it myself,but the person I purchased it for said they really enjoyed it."
2,"Too much camp, not enough adventure","I first saw this film in it's original theater release where I was very disappointed. The books are all high adventure with a naive 1930's idealism. This movie did a good job of captuing that feel but stepped too far into the Batman and Lost in Space campyness of the 1960's. It just becomes insulting to the audiance. I still watch it every few years since I enjoy Doc Savage, Ron Ely does a good job as Doc, and the casting of the Five was decent. Find some of the old books and read them instead. If you enjoy them, watch the movie and imagine what it could have been. Memorable Quote: ""Mona, you're a brick."""
5,Dom Irrera- Is this thing on?,"one of my all time favorite comedians...this DVD doesn't disappoint! Loved it! FUNNY,FUNNY,FUNNY!"
4,Good down-to-earth suggestions about one-income living!,"When I was preparing to make the ""big jump"" from two to one income in our family, I read many books about frugal living, expecting the worst. This book was informative, encouraging, and down-to-earth. I think we can all find a little of our life in her examples. Although I did not agree with some of her ideas (or maybe I'm just not willing to try them yet!), for the most part I found Joni's plan very do-able. Some very good recipes included, and a good chapter on shopping and cooking ahead."
5,Life changing book,"This book is a must have for any woman transitioning from ""work outside the home"" to ""stay at home"". It is chock full of wisdom and great ideas! This is no ""wash & reuse your plastic baggies"" kind of book. It has fantastic practical helps on everything from helping your grocery budget to making your own play-dough and non-toxic cleaning products. I have read and re-read this book many times."
4,"easy, practical information","Especially helpful for those moms looking to stay home full time, and know how to do without the second income."
2,For beginners only,This book will be helpful to you only if:a. You are a complete beginner to the art of living frugally.b. You don't wish to really go headfirst into frugal living.I have yet to find something truly original in this book. Most of her tips are common sense ideas that I have been practicing for quite some time. The writing style is poor as well.I much prefer The Tightwad Gazette. See my review for that book for my opinions.
2,Look elsewhere,"This muffled-sounding disc features Lightnin' with the psychedelic group 13th Floor Elevators (!) backing him, along with friend Billy Bizor on harmonica. This set is in a fight to the death with 'Lonesome Life', 'Live 1971' and 'It's a Sin to be Rich' for worst Lightnin' Hopkins album, but it's still not all bad. His playing is fine, but he hands over the vocal chores to Bizor on one track, another is an instrumental, and most of the songs lack the focus of his best material. This version of 'Mr. Charlie' rambles, and overall the feeling is one of punching the clock, 'get me my money'."
1,These used to be good but now they're junk,"I've ordered many of these over the past few years and quality control is gone way down hill. They basically arrive disassembled with either missing hardware or broken bones. The spines are all twisted like it should be called bucky the cripple skeleton. You have to take the entire skeleton apart just to correct the warping. The screw on the top can barely stay on and will collapse thanks to the excessively warped spine. All the screws along the spine are loose, floating around in the box or lost in transit. You can't find screws like this in the home improvement centers. Last one I got his arms were on backwards! The one before that had a bad drilling where the leg connects and too short a screw to attach the thumb screw. It's no good his leg wont stay on. Next time I think I'll order a Mr. Skeleton and see if they're any better."
4,won't play on all SACD players.,Wouldn't play on Pioneer and Yamaha. PLays on Cambridge Audio and SONY!
2,Doesn't quite hit the mark,I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much. I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc. Why would you disable that option? I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD. The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content.
5,the best!,In my view this is one of the best albums ever made. Have everything. One never get tired of it.
3,Good song....but overplayed,"Let me review this album for Money for Nothing,What are these idiots talking about? First of all, chicks aren'tfor free. You got the idea? Then Money is not for nothing. Yougot it right? Anyway, I've always liked this CD for Money for Nothing and it is one of the best songs by the band. The othergood songs on this are Walk of Life, (Very good), and So FarAway. But the rest....I can't stand this CD, it is really notgood stuff. I love this band but this isn't the band's best work.Get a better Straits album which has Tunnel of Love, TelegraphRoad, or Heavy Fuel. Don't fool with the most popular albums bythe band, this, and the Dire Straits debut. And all I hear onthe radio is Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing, those 2 arejust OVERPLAYED!!!!! Why can't I hear the lovely Tunnel of Loveor even Heavy Fuel on the radio????Those 2 are just as great. 3stars for this poor made cd. LISTEN TO THE OTHERS INSTED."
1,The Only Overplayed Dire Straits Album And Is The Weakest of the Straits albums,"This is just as bad as Communique. 5 of the songs on this arereally lame & weak. Why is this considered classic? Another overplayed album is Making Movies and I love that one, it hassome really nice tunes. If this is overplayed, I never see Moneyfor Nothing. All I see is So Far Away. And all I hear on the radio is either Sultans of Swing or Money for Nothing. If I'mgonna listen to this overplayed and overrated album, I will justlisten to the good songs. Plus this is also all I see in stores.Why is this also so popular, I mean why does everyone like thisso much? Especially radios need to stop playing just this andCommunique, and go with Love Over Gold, or On Every Street.See Ya Later."
5,A must-read for students of Computer Science theory,This textbook is an excellent overview of computer-science related mathematics. I don't know what I would have done in recent coursework without this resource. Kudos to Kenneth H. Rosen.
2,The Elusive Computing Rabbit just ...,"Discrete Mathematics is a conceptually taxing but often mechanically trivial subject. Comprehension of this subject is clearly essential for the good software engineer. Mr. Rosen exhibits a special skill in letting the unsuspecting student immediately fall down the old pedagogical rabbit hole where, like Alice in Wonderland, we're bewildered by cerebral cul-de-sacs, awash in incontrovertible inconsistencies, served a panoply of unsolveable puzzles, with a peppering of paradoxes for good measure. This all may be engaging for mathematical sycophants of the Red Queen with boku time on their hands but makes for restless sleep for the rest of us."
2,Okay but thats all,"The CZ does not sparkle at all, I doubt it is even CZ at all. It looks like gumball plastic. One of the hoops broke about a week after wearing them. Shame because I liked the hidden lock. The design seemed good enough to be considered contemporary not cheesy but oh well."
1,Video Review. See for yourself.,"Length:: 1:10 MinsVideo review for the Intech Automatic Putting Cup that will disprove most other reviews posted here. This review was taken one put after the product was first removed from the packaging. After sinking a 10 foot put, I was extremely disappointed that the electric put return was less than 2 feet. Terrible product. Should have returned it while I still could and not waited until 6 days after my return expiration date to open it. Highly advise NOT to buy this product. The video evidence does not lie like the other reviews do [low price and reviews were why I bought the product]."
1,Don't even waste your time.......,"To the want to be better putters out there, save your money. I knew there was a reason this item was priced so cheap. Everything arrived in good shape and on time and that's all the good I have to say. Very thin plastic and it only throws the ball back about 2-3 inches, maybe. I tried it on more than one plug in. Maybe I got a lemon, not worth my time to waste gas and spend money on the postage to return it, even if Amazon did offer to pay for it. I can't believe Amazon would let such a company sell this product on their web site. Surely, somebody tested it. Maybe not and maybe that's why the price was so low. Spend a little more and actually get a return that gets the ball back out of the tray.Thanks,OpenMinded"
4,Can't find it locally,I purchased this because it is not sold locally in stores any more. Now I have 12 which would probably last me a couple years but the expiration date was almost exactly a year from when I purchased it. But I had not been able to purchase it in years so it was good to be able to get it again. It's nothing great and not restaurant quality but I haven't found anything else that can easily be made at home that tastes better.
1,World War II book,I paid $40 for a book that was classified as acceptable. I am so completely disappointed with this product. It is falling apart. It is barely together. My post office even stamped it as damaged. To top that off it was wrapped in CHRISTMAS WRAPPING PAPER. I'm ready to get my money back. That is outrageous to be quite frank. I will never buy from this person ever again.
2,Made me feel clumsy and confused,"I bought this Crunch video with high expectations and was very dissappionted. The warm up is confusing, constantly adding more moves upon moves, and they don't even exercise to the beat of the music. It's bizarre to listen to music but not follow the beat. I will say that I definitely felt it in my muscles like I got a good workout, but I don't see myself ever using this video again. I want my workout to make me feel good about myself, this one just made me feel clumsy and confused."
4,total body workout,"This workout is not extremely intense, but you will get a good workout that includes your total body. The ab segment is short but you will feel the burn."
2,boring,The instructor is annoying. The workout is too easy. I didn't feel like I got a workout after doing it. My grandma could do this video! The only difficult part is the ab work @ the end.
1,Zumba Ditch the Workout,I thought the book and dvd was a cool plan to read to understand and dvd to watch & learn. Wrong -- what a major disappointment. I understood the dvd was a learning workout but it only shows steps but no actual workout. Major waste of money.
3,"Zumba: Ditch the Workout, Join the Party! The Zumba Weight Loss Progam","Zumba is the latest rage, and I can appreciate Beto's enthusiasm. However, I was very disappointed with the DVD. It was too basic so I'm donating it to the local Senior Center."
1,Great book but do not purchase for DVD,This book is very informative but unfortunately the DVD is not very helpful at all. Definitively get this if you are interested in signing up for a class but do not expect the DVD to be used in place of a class.
1,Misleading description,"From the description, I'd expect to receive a Zumba DVD, so that I can work out at my own schedule at home.How disappointed I was to find out it was a book with DVD sample of Zumba- that's all !!The description should mention that is a book.I'm not interested in reading Zumba at length, just want to do it."
1,So glad there are reviews to read!,I am so glad there are reviews to read about products before you buy them! I was seriously about to buy this when I read in the reviews that this is a BOOK that 'show' you dance moves! I mean come on! you can't do fitness from a book!!!
3,read about Zumba -the new porn exercise,The book is GREAT but the exercise is the new PORN dance. Keep your teens out of the Fitness Club Gyms.
2,MsM,Simply disappointing. Most of the book was his autobiography and that would have been o.k. if the DVD would have been an actual exercise DVD rather than just showing the basic dance steps. The nutrition portion of the book is good.
2,Not what you think,"Be sure to READ what you are ordering! I ordered this thinking it was an acutal work-out DVD, but it is a book and a DVD of music...no routine. After receiving it, I went back and THEN read the reviews-which I should have done first. Since I wanted a routine, I then went back and ordered the DVD ""Total Body Transformation System"" which I love."
2,Zumba,thought i was getting a music cd. wad really fooled. to much trouble to return the book. book not but help without the cd
3,"Zuma: Ditch the Workout, Join the Party! The Zumba Weight Loss Pogram","I was truely diasppoined that the dvd included was so very, very very short. Tthe story of Mr. Perez's life early life didn't fit with the title. I will purchase the video set, but this was not a wise use of my money."
3,reliable but loud,"This item seems to work just fine so far (I bought it a few months ago). It's a little noisy, but since I've never had one before I don't know if they all are. Anyway, for as inexpensive as it was, I figure I've gotten my money's worth."
1,failed after rewinding only three cassettes,Don't buy this piece of junk.Mine rewound about 3 tapes and then refused to work anymore.
2,"Great musicianship, but lacking impact","I have many, many fado CDs in my collection. Although the musicianship displayed in the CD is very good, the emotional delivery of the fado is overshadowed by arrangements that are too complex, effectively preventing the musicians from expressing the feeling that makes the fado a special art form. Cristina Branco's voice is good, but it lacks the despair and anguish found in other fadistas.If you want a display of technical musical ability, this is your CD..."
4,"The first I read, but not the best.","When I first read this book, I was expecting it to be about writing stuff that publishers would buy. Well, it had that all right, but not until it went through what they ARE buying, what other genres there are, how others broke in to the business, etc. In other words, stuff you could find pretty much any other place you look. On the other hand, when it does get into the actual ""writing"" of the book, it gives good information and good techniques that I believe any good writer could use. Whether or not you actually want to get published is beyond the point - you can skip that part if you want to."
3,An average energy bar,"It is unclear from the way this is listed exactly what they are selling. For 12 bars, the ""list price"" is outrageous, and the Amazon savings are suspect. For 12 bars the Amazon price is high, as supermarkets sell these for under $2 each (a recent sale has been at $1 each).These are an average energy bar. They come in a variety of flavors. The flavors are OK, but not exceptional. The sugar content is somewhat high. The values given for protein and fiber content are lower than some other bars on the market, for exampleClif Bar Energy Bar Chocolate Chip 12 Barswhich are available from Amazon at a lower price. The bar actually left me somewhat hungry.So, it is an OK bar, but you can shop around and find better bars at a lower price."
3,STAY AWAY FROM THE GAME,it is sooo dumb!! all they do is race. i thought it was going to be like the movie like trying to find back to the road or something but it is just racing. the graphics are terrible. save your 30 bucks and buy another game!!!
4,"Excellent, good resource to have...","The book is very good, it's an excellent resource for nursing students or even graduate nurses. I highly recommend it."
2,ouch...,"This book was a horrible disappointment.It initially sounds interesting: A wanna be Saint and his assistant help people that are having technical problems, and for his help the Saint advises the assistant in his love life. Interesting, right?The reality is more confusing than interesting.First of all is the problem with it is the book's flow. It's more like a series of short stories about the same general characters. There is almost no transition between the assistant's real life and his battles against a variety of technological demons, added to the fact that the fights themselves are more confusing than interesting.The aspect of the story that talks about the assistant and his relationship to his girlfriend is confusing as well.So does he do it or not (you'll understand of you read the book)?Besides, how good of advice about your love life would a celibate Catholic Priest give?"
5,You'll use this for years!,"This is just a very sweet lullaby album to remind you of how special your little girl is. My daughter is almost 4 and has been listening to this all her life. She is just starting to understand the lyrics and tonight she heard, ""Mama's pearl."" and asked what that meant. So I was able to explain that a pearl was a special jewel and she is like a special jewel to me. I am looking forward to her listening to it for many more years. Now I am going to buy the boy version for our new baby boy. I hope it's as good as the girl one."
2,Made absolutely no difference in my daughter's speech,"I'd love to write that this DVD was the key to unlocking my 2 year old daughter's speech, but it was not. She doesn't speak at all, and to make a long story short we are in the midst of early intervention, currently in speech therapy and attending a toddler program for kids with similar issues. I'm not saying that this is a bad DVD, but it hasn't worked for us."
3,My kid did get involved,"I will say that the production is cheasy but I did find my son repeating the words and giggling. My 2yr old son wanted to watch spongebob but instead I turned this on since I had just purchased it. I stayed in the room to see if it interested him and to my surprise, it did. I rate this a 3 because it does get kids involved and try to teach them to talk but a buyer expects a more impressive video. It is not up to date as far as production."
1,awful,"This has to be the stupidest dvd that I have ever purchased. I am not a complainer at all, but OMG my kids absolutely hated it. I have 1 with Autism that I was trying to get interested in it, but even he didn't like it :("
5,I wish I had it sooner!,"My son is 2 and receives speech therapy 5 times a week since he is not speaking any true words yet. I was amazed to see that much of what is on this DVD has been tought to him by his speech therapist. He was very proud of himself as he was able to mimic most of the facial expressions, sounds and the ""more"" sign upon first viewing. He looks back at me smiling as if to say ""see mom, I can do that!"" It is like having his speech therapist in the house 24/7! It's great for practice for him and he really seems to enjoy it as he mostly watches it twice. I wish I had it sooner to use alongside his therapy. My next child will start watching this DVD by a few months of age. I believe this DVD is beneficial to both parents and babies, speech delay or not."
3,A bit annoyed,"I was very excited to buy this video because of all the reviews. When we watched it for the first time my kids tried to repeat everything and enjoyed makeing there mouths like theres. However I was extremely dissapointed how short this movie is, makes it not worth wanting to watch it again.If given the choice to return it and get something else, I would!"
3,My son hates it,"I have a one year old and I have started showing him this DVD at the age of 9 months. He enjoys the colorful toys and it does capture his attention, however as soon as one of the tutors appears on the screen mouthing a certain sound he screams in horror. He's one and still has the same exact reaction. Definitely a bad buy at my end."
1,Toy ad,"There are several segments to this video. The parent section has 12 helpful points for helping your baby talk. The 3rd section is some basic signs, its short and ok.The main section is where the baby is supposed to be helped talking. It is a very boring, sterile, low budget toy advertisement. Many of the segments don't make any sense at all. Mostly showing a closeup of some toy with Fisherprice logo prominently displayed for no particular reason. The speech pathologists are completely stone faced during the entire video. It is painful to watch.Some of the segment focuses more on language than speech, ie trying to convey the concept of in and out. But rather than use a simple container and placing something in and taking it out, they have some bizarre complex toy where you drop a ball and it meanders around some obstacles to illustrate ""in"". Very confusing.This is one time I really wished I could have seen an excerpt before I bought it."
1,My son refuses to watch this :(,We ordered both Baby Babble DVDs for my 16 month old son. He absolutely loves Baby Babble 2 but he does not like the original Baby Babble. It does not grab his attention and he refuses to watch it. Go figure....
4,Great Video,I bought this for my 6 month old daughter. She's about to turn 2 now and still loves this video. It didn't help her talk early but now that she is getting better at talking she will copy the sound demostrations. Right now it's her favorite.
5,The Best.,"This DVD is by far the best video to encourage speech. I have 2 children that are both late talkers. I'm telling you, it is well worth the money. Great info for us parents. The sign language tutorial alone is gold. I own Baby Babble 2 as well and I'm so excited about Baby Babble 3! One of the BEST tools I have in overcoming my communication challenges"
5,Great DVD for Speech Delayed Toddlers,"Even if your kids don't watch TV, they will like this video. My son NEVER watched anything on TV until this video. He has a very short attention span, so we started with just watching 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, etc.. Now he watches almost 20 minutes at a time (not everyday, but most days). He really enjoys it. It is simple and fun. The writers offer good parent tips at the end of the ""show"" for kids."
4,ok,I bought this video because of the reviews here. I tried it at home and my 20 months was scared of the ladies making those sound. We have a big 55 inch tv and it focuses the mouth so big and she got so scared so I played it no more. I think this is a good learning dvd but doesnt work for my daughter.
5,"Wonderful for ALL children, especially families with children who have Apraxia","My son was diagnosed with Apraxia (he isn't able to connect his thoughts and verbalize them) which caused a lot of stress in our household due to problems communicating. Even though he was nearly 3 years old, his vocabulary was at best that of a 1 year old. After watching this video a couple of times, he started mimicking the sounds and copying the signs. It brought almost instant relief to our family. Suddenly my son was letting us know when he wanted something to eat or drink by signing rather than whining while we guessed what he wanted. I strongly suggest this video to all parents...even if an infant can start to pick up on the signs which he/she can use long before ""speech"" is expected."
1,Poor quality; very little worth...,"This is my third and last time writing a review for this item. The last two have been erased by the staff at amazon, although I don't know why.My wife bought Baby Babble for our daughter (21 months old) to help her along with speaking.There is very little in this video to aid in talking. Many of the expressions of the women (Speech Pathologists) in the video are either almost scarry or just plain bizarre. The quality of the video is very ""camcorder like"". We've got the entire series of DVD's of just about everything out there for a child, but I never thought any were cheap/poor quality until I saw this one.During the video you will see: A stoic woman sticking her tongue out; rolling her tongue; slurping followed by a cheap toy suspended by a string with no attempt to hide it.There are a few signs that they teach within the dvd, like how to sign, ""thank you"", or ""drink"", but there couldn't be more than 10 the entire dvd.This video IS NOT WORTH IT!!!"
3,KINYO UV-520SIL 1-WAY,This is the second VHS rewinder purchased from this Amazon seller -bay521-. First one that I purchased was the KINYO UV-413 1-Way VHS Rewinder. It lasted just about a full year. Hopefully this one will last as long or longer. I use it for about 1 to 2 VHS tapes per week.
1,Brand New but Didn't Work,"inserted tape. Rewinder would not close. When held closed, rewinder did not rewind tape. All it did was make a high-pitched squeal. Returned."
3,a trip down memory lane,"This dvd is a blast from the past. It doesn't contain any of the newer ponies that my daughter has become familiar with, but she loved it just the same. She asks for Pinkie Pie everytime she watches it so I had to order another dvd that includes her but this dvd still holds her attention."
4,Fastforward The Comercial,"Look,if you don't like the comercials before you are allowed to watch the show just fast forward the comercial and before you know it,your at he main menu of this DVD to choose go to ""Character Gallery"", then go to ""Play All Stories."" Now,for the other one star review,if you don't like the inapropriate language on this DVD,then give it away to somebody else and buy ""Percy's Choclate Crunch"" instead. So take my advice from now on."
1,Jive? I don't think so.,"This CD which misuses the word ""Jive"" has nothing on it that remotely resembles any Jive I've ever heard. Jive is supposed to swing, and none of these tunes swing. I doubt if the drummer could swing if he were hanging! This is the second time Amazon has led me down the wrong path with their ""recommendations."" I asked for my money back but Amazon didn't respond. Anyway that's the last time I do recommendations."
1,low quality,"I liked the idea of this product, but its too easy to break. they should make metal clip instead of plastic. I bought 4 of them and ALL THE CLIP BROKE!!"
2,Disappointed with this item...,"The metal clips that hook onto the tops and bottoms of the doors are not made well enough to hold your purses. Once we got the purses onto the holders, the hooks would fly off of the doors. One of the holders wouldn't even stay without the purses on it. We had bought a set of purse racks like these before from LTD Commodities a few years ago, and they worked just fine. It must be that the metal clips on these holders are not as sturdy. The only way I would recommend buying this product is if you plan on screwing it to your wall. This is not what we were planning on doing and I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known this in advance. This was a disappointing purchase."
2,Quality is not good!,"What I got is different from what I saw in the picture,the material is not the same, and the quality is not good.I returned it."
1,ehh,"I purchased this thinking that it would be better storage than the coat rack I had in the closet that housed my belts, scarves and bags. This doesn't hold any of my two handle bags, most belts but it does hold my scarves. I should have stuck with my system."
1,Hanging purse rack,This is not worth the money. I'm sorry that I purchased this. Cheap plastic clips which break each time you open the closet door. Very poor construction. This product even arrived with one clip already broken. Don't waste your money like I did.
3,Check your Dimensions,Great idea and works well. We had to nail it to the wall as our doors were too wide and long for the top and bottom clips. J
3,Small bags only need apply,"Although I purchased this as a means of storing ALL my bags, I discovered that anything greater than the weight of the smallest bags will cause the door clip to release. The hooks are easily adjustable, but are too narrow to accommodate wider purse straps without folding the straps (which is undesirable).My smaller bags have found a happy home. I sincerely hope the company creates a sturdier version for more serious bags sometime soon."
1,doesn't fit every door,"The big issue with this product is that the description doesn't make it clear that the ""over the door"" hanger will only fit thin doors. Yes they do provide some hardware that will allow you to attach the product to the face of the door...but this requires drilling holes into your door! Drilling holes would, in my opinion, defeat the purpose of an over the door storage system."
5,Really enjoyable,"Sherrie Austin's ""Words"" is an incredible showcase for some amazing vocal talents. Austin, even on her first album, has found her own distinctive style and sound without it sounding produced and contrived."
5,Sherrie Austin is the next Faith Hill and Shania Twain!,"Every song on this cd is great. One Solitary Tear should be up for some type of award, if it hasn't already been nominated. From start to finish, this cd is one of my favorite country albums. I would highly recommend it!"
4,Vibrant Life in a Dead City,"Kevin Brockmeier's novel, A Brief History of the Dead, brings a thought provoking story framework around an old idea - that the dead exist in a place based on who remembers them in life. His story: What if Everyone Dies and no one is around to remember the dead? It's so well-defined and character driven that the lives he gives to the dead are rich and beautiful. I've been thinking of this story often since reading it, and that's the true test of whether a novel works or not.It's not all great, however. Where I think A Brief History of the Dead failed is that it took a decent concept and then went ""end of the world"" with it. Brockmeier tried to make it too significant, too important, and in the end I thought it was an impersonal story, so for me it failed.** Note, this is an edited review. I thought about it for several months before realizing that the flaws came through with contemplation. Please accept my revision with that in mind.- CV Rick"
3,Meh,"I was excited about this book, but it failed to live up to my expectations. It was a lovely meditation...but that was about all. (Might have worked better as a short story, which I think it may originally have been.) I didn't find the story terribly engrossing, aside from the first few chapters of Laura's expedition in the arctic. And the ending was seriously lacking any sort of emotional high point or closure."
2,Just Average,"Not sure why this was a bestseller. Found it flat, predictable and just plain not interesting."
3,"Great premise, but...","The idea behind this book was great, although I am sure it would have made a much better short story. I finished the book because I had to, not because I wanted to."
4,Complex and Inviting,"Brockmeier creates an unusual image of the afterlife, one that not many would find themselves contemplating. His descriptions are vivid, and as each character in the City of the Living Dead is explored through individual chapters, the reader can gain the sense that this City is just as alive as the world its inhabitants left behind.This book also contains subtly throughout a call to acknowledge the somewhat complex and, at times, dark values we as a society hold dear: Capitalism, commercialism, vengeance. His detailed account of Coca-Cola's public relations in this elaborate corporate future may make the reader never want to drink another Coke product for the rest of her days!A definite must read! Thought-provoking and poignant, ""The Brief History of the Dead"" begs those of us still alive to examine what is most important (our relationships with others) and to abandon those things which detract from it."
3,falls flat,"Found this book to be fascinating, thought provoking and engaging until the very end, where it just falls flat. Not sure how publisher did not send back and say come up with a better ending. If it had been re-worked a little more it could have been a great book. The potential is there.Listened to this on mp3 player through NetLibrary and LOVED Richard Poe's narration. That was stellar. Will be sure to look for more books that he has narrated."
4,Really good,"Beautifully written, and quite a good read. I first read the beginning section of this in the New Yorker, and it was haunting -- hard to forget. The ending of the book is disappointing. I suspect the author is still used to writing short stories, and found it difficult to sustain his tale through a whole novel. I hope that he goes on to write many more successful ones, because this is an impressive start."
2,Great premise but left a little frustrated,"This is a great premise of a story. I did enjoy the sections based in both Laura's world and the city but on the whole I found the book frustrating.It is true, you do start to realise there is not going to be a happy ending and the end of the book is so obvious that you do feel a little let down in the last few pages.Some of this book is beautifully written and some of the characters are wonderful but in contrast I found other parts of the book boring - I disliked the sections of the religious man's life and indeed the last chapter of Laura's.Maybe it just wasn't for me but I got to the end and felt - what was the point?If you find a copy try reading it - maybe this will be somebody's little gem of a book."
5,"A very good movie, but where is the DVD.","I Have seen this movie on television many times and i like it very much. It is a very exciting and entertaining movie with a good story that keep you interested from start to finish.I can't understand why this fine movie not has been realeased on DVD,It deserves so and i would have bought it immediately if it had been released.This is a much better movie than many of the other movies that has reached the DVD-market."
4,The Best of Elizabeth George's Novels,"This is my favorite George novel of the 4 I've read so far.It keeps you in suspense throughout and adds new twists, turns and characters as it goes along. It also has a variety of unusual topics (I won't ruin the surprise for you). I enjoyed St. James' increased visibility and Lynley's character and history are explained in more detail. St. James' sister is a great kook. Deborah's character and conflicts are very touching (ok, ok, maybe more so for women).I just wish I'd started reading her novels in chronological order because the characters have become very interesting but some of the surprises lose their impact when read out of order.Overall a great read!"
2,Boring Soap Opera,"This is the 4th E. George book I've read, and had I read it first it would have been the only one. I'm reminded of why I like ""Law and Order"" on TV, because everything has to do with the plot and there is very little to do with the characters' private lives. This book should really be under the ""romance"" category, because it positively obsesses over Deborah and Simon's romance, yet never makes me care one iota whether they get together or not. In fact, I didn't care one iota about anybody in the book and rather hoped that many of them would die. I only read it because I was on a long flight and had no options. Please, don't waste your time folks."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book really stinks. The character who gets murdered first doesn't even have one spoken line before he dies. The reader doesn't care who killed him because you never get to know the guy... or care about him. And, frankly, I thought the rest of the characters should have been mass slaughtered. Where's Jason when you really need him? Don't read this book without a chainsaw on hand!"
1,What?,"Usually after listening to a cd 5 times or so you grow to like it. With this cd you don't. Its just horrible. I think there was like one ok song on it. I don't know why i bought it. If you are thinking about buying this don't. Buy: Jump, Little Children, Stereophonics, Marvelous 3, Dovetail Joint, Memory Dean, Granian, Switchfoot, Guster, Athenaeum. Anything but this. Please!"
5,Rhodiola and Dr. Ramazanov have radically changed my life,"I have had a number of serious health problems which have impacted my imune function, energy, and general vitality. I began taking Dr. Ramazanov's formulation of Rhodiola and 3 other botanicals, named Frutaiga, and my health has been incredibly impacted for the better. I have energy, my body is resisting illness and stress, and I've lost 21 pounds in about 8 weeks. My wife just had our third child, and she weighs ten pounds lighter than pre-pregnancy in just 2 weeks after childbirth and her clothes fit her already! Don't stop at just reading this book. Put it into practice by putting Dr. Ramazanov's botanical blend into you! Dr. Ramazanov doesn't mention his botanical blend he formulated for Frutaiga because the book released before the product.

5,It has the WOW factor for my table,I love this flatware. I purchased one box from TJ Maxx but could not locate another box at the same great price. I came online and found it for $30 more but it is still a lot of style for less then $75.It looks terrific and modern in my new renovated kitchen. The set is a little large for children to use. You won't be sorry to buy this flatware....
5,"Heavy, stylish flatware","I had been needing a new set of flatware for years, but hadn't really seen a design that caught my eye in a good quality 18/10 product. Since I'm not always prompt with getting things into the dishwasher, I wanted to make sure I got the quality stuff that wouldn't stain and tarnish by sitting in dishwater too long.When I spotted these, I knew I had found what I had been looking for -- heavy, substantial flatware with the high quality stainless (18/10), and a fun and unusual design. This flatware pattern is not for wimps -- the pieces are large, heavy, and you know they will last a lifetime. They have been through several cycles in the dishwasher and come out sparkling and shiny. My guests have complimented me on the cool design, too! I've also ordered some cocktail forks and serving pieces to fill out the set."
5,What a Blessing!,"I was given this CD by a very dear friend, and what a blessing it is. It is a pleasant blend of fun songs and mother's prayers. A must-have for all mothers of baby boys! For the first few weeks of my son's life, we rocked and sang to it over and over. What special times those are! Now that he's (slightly) older, I keep it in the car to soothe him on long road trips. We love it!"
5,Steven Wright I have a pony,"This cd contains the material on his 1985 HBO special.It is not an import only, you can find it on stevenwright.com as well as ebay. He has jokes like ""I bought some used paint, it was in the form of a house"". ""Sometimes I like to look up in the sky and smile for a satelite picture"". If you like Stevn Wright you should google comedians Mitch Hedberg (mitchhedberg.net) and Austin Peterson (apcomedy.com) Both do one liner comedy."
2,Buy Taylor's Book Instead,"Simply put, not as clear as John Taylor's error analysis book. If you want a good explanation for how and why to approach error analysis, this book does not do the job."
1,Boring and Stiff Pilates,"This was very disappointing and non motivating instruction. They did not really go over breathing very well, which is so essential in Pilates. Did not provide any good visuals mentally to help you relax and get into the exercises. The women instructors were very boring and stiff. My past instructors at the gym were so much more fun and motivating. I wish they would do a video. Totally inappropriate title of ""Breakthru Pilates"""
2,Would be nice if they send what the picture was.,"I was really happy when the sifter came in the mail, but was very disappointed to find that it was not the one I thought I was ordering in the picture. The one I did get looks like a giant one cup measuring cup. It can hold up to 5 cups it says and need one C battery. Nice pluses, but if I really wanted this item I would have looked for it and bought it. Kinda disappointing."
5,Never would have guessed this works so well.,"I love this sifter. It holds a very large capacity, sifts quickly, without any problems. You can sift a large amount very efficiently. It makes using the hand held sieve sifting method obsolete. I also was very surprised and pleased how easy it is to disassemble and clean. Great feature. I highly recommend this product."
4,Norpro Battery operated sifter,"I have used this product before, but I washed it and it broke, so I ordered a new one. Just use a dry or damp cloth to clean it. I have arthritis in my fingers, so this effortless product is just the thing I need to sift without any pain in my hands. Just put the ingredients in the sifter, hold it over a bowl and press the button. No more banging my hand on an old fashioned sifter. It works quickly! I love gadgets this this. Wouldn't be without it."
1,Waste of money,"I was so excited to get this product because I sift a lot of flour, powdered sugar, etc. I used it for a few minutes and set it aside for good. It is very slow. The sifting is done via vibration rather than any type of shifting paddle so it takes much longer than doing it by hand. Plus the product design allows clumps to get through three small grooves on the bottom where the screen attaches. I had to use my hand to catch the clumps and finally just re-sifted."
2,Have to BANG AGAINST SURFACE to START WORKING,"I had an old one of these only used once, I think. I'm cooking again, so needed the sifter. Nothing happened when I put in the new C battery...I tried another one... then another one. None worked. Then I read review from someone who said she/he had to bang it against a surface to start working. I'll be darned... it worked! But, since I already used old hand sifter for what I needed, I didn't test how long it would stay vibrating after first bang.Since there are so many great reviews here, I'm going to try another one.. and hope that this newer one will work."
1,Led Zeppelin No Quater,"My last review of this C.D. was while I was listening to the beginning and middle of it. I would seriously reconsider purhcasing this C.D. or the D.V.D. as ""4 sticks"" and ""Kashmir"" are severely discouraging; these two songs are as if a balloon just lost all its air. I wish I could return the darn C.D., though unfortunately I can not as there is technically nothing wrong with it - this is a huge disappointment...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL...."
3,Don't throw the old version away.,"I wanted to give this the top rating and say how excellent it is, what a nice version of ""The Rain Song"" is included, how improved the remastering is. But I can't rave about it and have mixed feelings due to a very unethical and unadvertised change. The best new song, ""City Don't Cry"", was hacked in half, a fact not mentioned anywhere. Why was this done? To make room for ""Wah Wah"" so they could advertise a new song on the cover sticker? I like ""Wah Wah"" okay, but not the expense of the much better ""City"". It's just unacceptable to hack up a great song and take advantage of fans like that. The sad thing is if not for this botch, everything else about this is 5 stars. I don't mind the melancholy ""The Rain Song"" replacing ""Thank You"" or even the weird name change to ""Yallah"". The duel vocals on ""The Battle of Evermore"" are as thrilling as ever. ""Kashmir"" is one the greatest rock songs of all time. The sound quality is much better. But they blew it."
4,For All Time,Jill Barber has just a soft and mellow voice for her folk(ish)songs. I'm very happy with this CD and will likely get more from her catalog.
3,"Decent artbook, but not the original","I was happy to discover that artbooks were being adapted by American companies, for much cheaper than the Japanese ones! This artbook has the same pretty pictures of the Japanese: beautiful color of Hikaru, Umi, Fuu and friends as well as some notes towards the end.However, compared to a japanese artbook, the pages are thicker and it looks more like a completed coloring book than a true artbook. However, this costs about half the price of what I've seen the original book for. Therefore, buying this is not a bad idea ---same pictures, lower quality, lower price---but still definitely worth it."
4,this is a shirt,"This shirt is muscly, I am not, that means this shirt becomes flabby. I like fish sticks and yogurt. Not at the same time. I don't like dip the fish sticks into the yogurt or anything, that's gross!"
3,OK,"I felt the language did not flow. It was hard for me to read and for my 5 year old to understand. He was asking questions about all the pictures because the story was hard for him to understand. I checked the book from the library, but I would not buy."
5,DS Game,Game was purchase to go with the DS system; the recepient is loving every momemnt of this game.
4,Keeps going,"This is an entertaining game that keeps going and can't be beat. It can be loads of fun if your friend's have the game on DS and you connect together and play. Also, it can be a little tiring going for the same walks over and over. This is a great long trip game."
1,Bought Used -- No Good,"It was used and couldn't access some of the options (entering contests and competitions) to get the money needed in the game to do things. Plus, could not clear out puppy first user had to get our own puppy. My daughter won't play it anymore. Maybe new is better."
4,Nintendogs,"First off, I've only watched my sister play, so I'm not that accurate.It's fun. What's not fun about a puppy? No messes, and great for people with allergies who want a furry (virtualy) friend.But it gets sort of old. You do the same things, every time. And no matter how cute Benny the Lab is, he's not real, and's sorta boring."
5,The Cooooooooooooooolest game ever,"This game is sooooooooooo cool you just have to get it.you can walk your dog. the more times you walk your dog the further you can go next time. you can enter your dogs in contests. there are three types of contest. Agility, obidence and disc trials. i find obidence the hardest. you can also go shopping. go to the discount shops. their prices are much lower. when you see a light bulb or a bone appear above your dogs head press and drag it to your dogs mouth. he shoud then eat it and learn a trick or trust.Thats me. i hope it was a help. you just have to get it. bye"
1,A GAME OF DOGS!?,"Who would want to control a dog's life digitally! For God's sake, just buy a freakin dog! And if you're allergic or not allowed to own one, then you are pathetic to stooping so low to buy a video game of owning a dog! IT'S AN ANIMAL WITH NO SOUL! Video games are supposed to have action / adventure / skill in them. I don't see any action / adventure / skill in changing your dog's water bowl. Training an imaginary dog? What an adventure!! Overall- it's not even one star. There is no number of stars to describe a game so boring / lame / ridiculous / embarrassing / pathetic!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU OWN THIS, YOU MUST HAVE NNNOOO LIFE!! What a waste of productive time!!It just blows my mind!!! A GAME OF CONTROLLING A DOG!!! AAAHH!!"
1,Cute but boring.,"My mom,sister and i went to bestbuy and my sister Zoe got the chihuahuaand friends version. When we got home Zoe started playing her new game.I wanted to see what she was doing so i looked at her little chihuahuarunning around on the screen.... that was a mistake. I fell in love.I felt bad about not buying the lab&friends; version. So the next day wewent back to bestbuy and i got the lab&friends; game. It was fun fora week but it got repetative and boring. Do not get this game it is awaste of money."
3,Nothing new,"This book has nothing that I was looking for...It's not very well fundamented on scientific studies, nor it is a thourough study of what Nature (genes) and Nurture (environment, education) can influence you.It's just a fun reading for a weekend, nothing more.The author just finalizes by saying that it's not anyone's fault that they are what they are... and they can't blame their parents for their inherited genes or by the education they had, because parents allways hope for the best...Nothing new..."
5,Have a cocktail with this on!,I work in a gallery and put this cd on as an experiment. I couldn't help but notice people humming along! It's lovely music.
5,Un Homme et Une Femme,"This is one of the most beautiful collection of songs that I have ever heard. Every time I listen to my CD (morning, noon and night) I see the movie all over again. Every song while different in its own way, relates to the other, either with subtle counter melodies or sweeping harmonies. Every time I listen to this soundtrack, I hear something interesting that I missed before. If you can appreciate the classics, this should definately be in your selection for listening pleasure. Thirty five years after it's release this music is as fresh today as it was then. Definately the work of a true genius."
4,Great Product !,"I searched everywhere for a product that would result in a ""just came from the beauty parlor"" look. I have difficult frizzy/wavy/has its own mind hair. It worked! The only drawback is you can't use it on wet hair. My daughter whose curly hair is very difficult to manage, loved it! I sectioned my hair, used only a little bit of product per section and using a round, stiff brush, blew out each section. Voila! Jam Heat Styles straightened out and conditioned my hair. My hair came out shiny, bouncy soft and manageable. It really protects your hair from heat damage as advertised. I ordered from Amazon because I could not find it in my local area at any drugstore, department store or beauty supply store. I would recommend this product without reservation"
4,"it really works, but so do you!","1. It works, but expect to use a buffer or a drill attachment. Doing by hand was not very effective.2. This stuff is very expensive for such a small amount.3. Don't waste your money on the Blue Job polishing cloth. It's just a soft cloth that is over-priced. Had I seen it in person, I would not have purchased it.4. Four stars due to the price and amount received. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars."
5,"Good Product, if a little cheaply made.",This kit works well for what it's for. However I would not recommend this for hard core off-roaders. The parts are cheaply made and do compromise some of the strength of the frame. The only part that is a hassle is installing the rear bumper. It requires cutting and some expertise. One thing to note is that this kit does not require a steering wheel shaft extender as some kits do.
1,Freud P410 burns wood,"Since day one, this saw has burned wood while ripping. Thinking my table saw was out of line, I kept trying to tweak alignment of blade to table and to fence, tho it never needed little if any correction. Yesterday it burned samples badly and I again checked all alignments, everything dead on! I checked side clearance, tooth to plate, about .004"" each side. I then used an old blade and got no burning. Today I called Freud. Answer was, ""That's the way it is designed, coating is to eliminate burning(?). We can't help, but if it is not satisfactory, check with Amazon, replace it with a blade with more side clearance.""I sure can't say the P410 is satisfactory for me!"
4,A Good Book to Read Regarding the Death Penalty,"Loren Estleman is known as an excellent storyteller. In fact, even Elmore Leonard has praised him for the way he can craft a tale. The interesting thing about this book is that he manages to examine and address one of the more pressing social issues of our time. This story about a hangman, takes a long look at the death penalty. Thankfully, it's done in a subtle matter. On its face, this is not a ""political"" book. Instead, it's an interesting read that will make you think long and hard about the death penalty when you finish the book at the end.I downgraded the book to 4 stars because the chronological flow of the story was sometimes confusing, but overall, this book is worth the investment and would be a great book for discussion in a book club."
3,not for the city dweller,"not as practical as I expected--more for the hiker or camper. I was hoping for ideas to use while walking in the neighborhood, sitting in an urban backyard, or visiting a city park. Some neat ideas for those on their way to the real outdoors, though!"
3,Half/Half,"Ok, Lucas, a 14 yr. old nerdy boy, falls madly in love with an older prettier cheerleader (who ends up dating a football player). Meanwhile, a cute girl is into Lucas and he doesnt notice. What's he do? Like a typical guy he tries to impress the cheerleader, so he joins the football team. What happens? He almost ends up dying. To make matters worse, he still doesnt end up with the chick by the end of the movie. I gave this movie 3 stars because Lucas was cute and i would of gone out with him because of his persistence and innocence...whatever. Um, also I like the shower scene he did...'cause it was funny, that's it, ok!"
1,Not family friendly!,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Anyone with half a brain knows what's coming next. It is not family friendly as there is male nudity, swearing and the ""f"" bomb. I can't wait to trade it in on something worth my time."
3,"Great introduction, but missing crucial info","My son brought this book home from school, and we both enjoyed reading it. It was a good reading level for him (he's a precocious 6 1/2). It's an endlessly fascinating topic, one of the most significant finds ever in the field of archeology, it would seem.But there is a large and surprising omission from the story of the Iceman, which is that he died not from hypothermia as ""Ice Mummy"" claims, but from being shot by an arrow. The flint arrowhead is embedded in his shoulder, but its existence was overlooked (incredibly) for two whole years after his discovery. ""Ice Mummy"", however, was published seven years after the discovery, so one wonders why this information is not included.Except for this big hole, it's a great book, and even *with* the hole, I still recommend it, especially if you can fill in the remaining part of the story yourself (it's easy to find more information on the net)."
3,It works just ok.,"The idea is good. A lot of plungers dont work with new low flush toilets because they don't produce a good seal when plunging and water escapes the side. I thought this one would be THE plunger but it comes up short. First it is made of a harder plastic rather than soft rubber so it also has a difficult time sealing too. Also, the vent valve is strange and seems to hinder the force of the water when plunged. The design is good and does a good job of going deeper into the toilet. It did work on a tough clog but it took a while and some time. I think if the bottom portion was soft rubber and was design to seal better, it would unclog stuff much quicker. I'm still looking for a better one."
4,Great Plunger,Works great. Clears clogs effectively and avoids splashing. So much better than the old style plungers. Every home needs one of these for those emergencies.
5,I like this one.,This book does very well in continuing the saga of Jamie Ian McCallister. It follows Jamie on his path of revenge and commitment. I would have to say that this book #4 in the series of 6 brings to life the west and a special moment in American History namely speaking the...never mind if you want to know what I am talking about I would reccomend that you get the book because it is well worth it.
4,Good solo debut,"Bizzy Bone's solo debut album ""Heaven'z Movie"" is a very good first solo. There are only two reasons as to why this album doesn't get a full 5 stars from me. The first reason is that some of the songs were cut short and it could've used a little more tracks. The second reason is that Bizzy's new solo album ""The Gift"" is better. I highly recommend you buy ""The Gift"" if you are a Bone fan like me. I rated the songs on how I feel how good they are. One star means the worst, and 5 stars means the best.1. Roll Call**2. Thugz Cry*****(BEST SONG!)3. Marchin' On Washington***4. Yes Yes Y'all*(Too short)5. Menensky Mobbin'****6. Waitin' For Warfare*****7. Mr. Majesty II****8. Brain On Drugs***9. On The Freeway****10. Demons Surround Me****11. (The Roof Is) On Fire*****12. Nobody Can Stop Me****13. Social Studies*****"
3,A few Good ones...,"This album was pretty good but there's hardly any tracks, kinda of a rip off, mad lyrics, try track 12, it's phisat. Peace"
5,Da Bomb!!,"This album is all that and a bag of chips. I love Bizzy cuz he is so damn fine, and his voice is so different, you cant help but listen to what he has to say. He really needs all tha props cuz his album wuz Da Bomb. Much luv to him and hiz album, cuz they goin all the way!!!"
5,Love and Gravity Best of the Four,"I purchased this Cd last, after aquirring 1, 2, and 4. And without a doubt this is the bands finest, and strongest offering. I find myself constantly pulled back to this CD, the structure and flow is excellent. Van Stephensons ""If That Was A Lie"" is heart wrenching, and very moving, why he isn't utlized more is beyond me, and considering what has happened to him, its kind of a shame. Everyone should be aware of what a great talent he was, he wrote alot for Restless Heart early on, and Henry Paul too, fronted the Outlaws in their infancy, and was responsible for quite a few of their hits."
1,save some cash and get a real harmonica,"these hunks of metal arent even good as toys, the reed plates are too stiff and unresponsive, giving out on the draws and squeaking on the blows.after considerable tweaking I got 3 out of 8 harps to work, if they hadn't been a gift I would of ditched them into the trash..."
5,Felix is the one who knows the cause of things,"Benjamin Taylor's Tales Out of School combines a beautiful coming of age/coming out tale, reminiscent of Edmund White's A Boy's Own Story, with an intellectual bildungsroman, with an attentive historical novel about Jews in turn of the century Texas, with an almost Pynchonesque sub-plot about the early days of manned flight. It is a strange and wonderful concoction, and a novel I have returned to many times, enjoying it more with each reading."
5,all them,Parabenizo todos os americanos pelo excelente trabalho de seu conterrneo - o Kenny G. É muito bom poder ter em sua terra um artista com tal talento. Suas músicas so belas e agradáveis. Possuo quase toda a sua coleo e no me canso de ouvir e relaxar com suas músicas.Parabéns Kenny G.
1,"If You Don't Want Bad Reviews, Don't Release Bad Music!","Most of Kenny G's music is the same from album to album. Most of the reviews of his other albums apply to this one. As a result, I present to you some quick exerpts from other albums: ""relaxes me"", ""boring"", ""not jazz"", ""insipid"", ""repetitive""."
1,not comfortable,"They hurt to wear -- the soles create pressure points all over, inherent in the design."
1,comfort,These really are not at all comfortable to wear. I tossed them out after I brought them on vacation.
4,"Songs About Me, Oh Yeah","Ok, I admit that I have fallen in love with Trace's voice, it is just one of those raspy, deep voices that makes me melt, the fact that he is tall and not hard on the eyes doesn't hurt either. After hearing the first single, Songs About Me, off his new CD on the radio got me excited about the new music coming out and he didn't disappoint. From the title track to the final Honky Tonk Badonkadonk this CD is full of ballads and fun songs that Trace does so well. His emotions come thru on his songs."
3,Shoulda waited for the next Greatest Hits album,"This was my first Trace Adkins album, and I'm sorry to say that I shoulda just waited for the greatest hits version, cause I really only enjoyed 2 tracks, the popular ones that'll definitely be on a greatest hits, Songs About Me and Honky Tonk Badonkadonk. I had no idea Trace sang so many slow songs, is that true of all his CDs?? If I wanted the slow songs, I'd have gone to another artist known for his beautiful vocals, not someone known for his tough and cool demeanor."
3,First part good but second part not enough,"I passed both exams end 2002 using this book and other materials.It is certainly a good preparation tool for the first exam but it is not enough for the second part. You need 46 correct answers on 60 questions which is one of the highest score needed for an Oracle exam.For at least 15 questions I had during my exams, the answer could not be found in this book. For some points of the exam Test Content Checklist which can be found on the Oracle web site, there is not even a word in this book.My advice :- use this book to have a general understanding of the subject.- do all the exercices of the book, it's really useful if you don't work with Forms everyday.- buy youself a Self Test Software. At least 15 questions I had during my exam were simular to the ones you can find in this preparation tool and there are not in the book.Good luck for your exam"
2,Not Adequate,"This book might have covered the exam material in sufficient detail back when the pass marks were set in the low 60% range, but now they are set at 75%+ this book is not adequate. This is particularly true for the second exam. At first glance the book appears to cover all the topics, but it will not give you the level of understanding required to ensure a pass in the exams. Study the book, try some STS exam questions, and you will see what I mean.Consider buying additional material to supplement this for study purposes."

4,Brooks and Dunn are fun!,"I have always enjoyed their songs. I particularly like the songs My Maria and Lost and Found. I like the fact that the songs tell stories. they are also nice to dance to with your honey at home. they may tend to get a little sidetracked with some of their songs not being too ""country"" but I do enjoy them anyway."
5,Brooks & Dunn / The Greatest Hits Collection,"You don't have to be a fan to like this one. Country, Rock, and Honky Tonk. Cd has 19 excellent songs, my favorite is ""My Maria"". Would I buy this Cd again? Yes, in a heart beat. I highly recomend this one."
1,Yechhhh.,"I can't stand Brooks and Dunn. However, their public relations man must be the best! So much fuss over so much garbage!"
4,Amazing Binocular At This Price Point,Thse binoculars offer a wide field of view which is an advantage when birding. Close focus is also very useful. Case and strap are nothing to rave about but the binocular's quality of construction and ease of focus were very good.
1,inadvertantly amusing,"Clearly there is a divergence of opinion about this book, but if you are considering buying it consider also why our host tolerates unfavorable reviews at all. It knows that ""fan"" is short for ""fanatic"", that authors and musicans attract energetic (or otherwise unengaged) partisan proponents, and thus that most reviews will be favorable and inflated. The most suspect favorable reviews here are those that praise this book's litary qualities, for the long and short of it are that it has none. (Aesthetically this is pretty much the equivalent of daytime TV. If you haven't seen it for some time, the unabashedness of its banality can fascinate you briefly.)"
1,dreadful but also (sadly) typical: pulp,"This is the stuff that tarnishes science-fiction's reputation. Yes, the group telepathy was fun, but persons as inept at handling English prose as ""Chrysalids""'s author proves himself to be should never, ever be published. Dreck."
4,A Sci-Fi Classic,"Reading this book was very enjoyable, it showed me the genesis point for a lot of the later books I have read - especially the Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody.The story is so well written that it doesn't seem dated in the least, a really enjoyable read. One of the few Sci-Fi classics that really hold up to the test of time!"
3,I liked it..,"This book was required reading in my high school one year, and I thought it was kinda cool then. I don't like Sci-Fi but in this book, Sci-Fi is not what it's about.. it's merely the vehicle that is used to tell the story. And this story is very thought-provoking, a message about tolerance and redemption and standing up for yourself. I've recently started collecting books, and this is one that is definitely gonna be added to my collection."
3,OK Book Boring For Teens,"We Read this book in our grade 9 class at SSS. Most people found it boring and I did to. Even though it does talk about mutating and stuff like that it did not have enough action to keep a youth interested. It's also a book heavily weighed on ""GOD"" so if you are not a beliver, not a very great book to read. It makes a lot of mentions towards Jesus and God and i Didn't think it was very appropriate to read in a public school. Anyway im sure if you were an adult you would enjoy this book!"
4,A book with a lot of details and actions.,This book is packed with actions and surprises. This book shows how thoughtful John Wyndham is.
4,An excellent read for any age!,"I read this book back in high school, grade 10 I think. This was the best book I have ever read and I have read many other good books! Obviously most of these high schoolers who bash the book are a bunch of high schoolers with NO imagination! It was a timely story which took advantage of our internal fear of the end of the world and thereafter. What I liked even more is that what the author predicted what could happend didn't seem too unrealistic. Highly recommended!"
4,It was good,"We had to read this book for our NS class, and a lot of people found it boring. It's provocative, it makes you think. There's so many ""why's?"" and ""what's?"" in the beginning, and at first, it was quite dull. But as you go on, there's something about the idea of thought shapes and Aunt Emily's death that's very mesmerizing, that keeps you hooked. Overall, I think it was an amazing book"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","The only way to read this book is with the Coles Notes, the other way is long and dry. The book doesn't make any sense, why is it so stupid? Don't read this book unless you are forced to by the School Board. The book should be cut down to 25 pages, and could have been if the author didn't use so much detail, and unimportant facts."
5,Great for kids!,My sons love Thomas. Thanks for having such a great selection of children's shows available. Keep up the good work!
2,The House Of Pendragon - Am I Missing Something?,"I bought this book on the strength of the 3 reviews posted on the first page of the book entry, all of which gave it very high marks. There is some good writing in the genre of fantasy/historical fiction, and I am always in search of it. This wasn't it.I guess the plot twist of Arthur actually having a (gasp) daughter was supposed to be enough. The characters are not even remotely believable and the action is strained to the point of histrionics and repetitive to boot.I have to confess that I quit reading it a little more than halfway through, which is almost unheard of for me. So if the last part morphed into reasonably engaging literature, it's my loss. But I won't be buying the other two."
4,A great album people don't know about.,"There are some really good tracks on this album. One I feel that is great is ""I Bet You Never Thought I'd Find You."" This album makes for a nice chill out session."
3,returned,There were several things I liked about this bag. Shoe storage on each side of the handle is a smart use of space. The pockets made sense as well. So nice organization in this bag I returned it because I just didn't like the look and needed more room for clothing and less for files. This bag might be better suited to men then women. Just personal preference.
1,very disappointed,"I purchased this rolling bag about six months ago. I travel frequently for work and depend on this bag to get me through airports and into and out of schools. The telescoping handle stopped retracting about a month ago and an airline agent showed me how to push the little button in the rear compartment to free the mechanism. Picture lots of people waiting as I unzipped the bag to fool with the handle on shuttle buses, in airline aisles, etc. Then last week the black plastic handle that is supposed to cradle inside the other handle snapped off the bag as a bus driver lifted it. I am going to contact Kensington about a refund because the bag is still under warrantee. I do not want a replacement unless the bag has been redesigned. I really liked that vertical design of this bag because it could be pulled down aisles in planes."
3,What is this a compilaiton or a cd?,"Every song features 2 or more people. Some of these songs are really wack, but sum like get yo ride on ft. eazy e are sick. If u want a good mack 10 cd buy the self titled"
3,should have been a magazine article,"The message here is good, but it could have been put across ina magazine article...[this book] is the first thing I have ever wantedto send back because I do not feel like I have gotten value for my money.Live in the moment. Big deal! I have no doubt that the Kane's are beautiful people who really do walk their talk and have valuable things to teach- but this book really left me disappointed. Their anecdotal stories are almost annoying and hardly pertinent.I give this book three stars because it does contain valuable truths- I just don't like the way it was packaged.I am reading The Four Agreements at the moment and agree with other reviewers that this book is far more profound and thought provoking. Don't waste your money on ""Working on Yourself..""."
2,Nothing new under the sun,This book and the ideas proposed by the author's have a registered trademark! This is an oversimplified layout of acheiving internal peace and transformation. The authors propose that living in the moment and forgiving others are the means to achieve inner peace. Although this has been pertinent advice throughout the ages I am unclear how they could claim a registered trademark on these ideas. Save your money.
3,beginner's stuff,"If you have any previous experience with meditation and mindfulness practices, this material is pretty much rank beginner stuff. Great for people who haven't figured out that they are not their thoughts; if you've moved beyond that point, forget it. There is a widely circulated Tibetan technique for pain control, originally called ""shinay"" included in the book, but it's not that big of a deal - you can find that practice in lots of places."
1,Another Anti-Environmental Rant,"Ron Arnold has made a career out of attacking people who want to leave to the next generation an intact, beautiful, natural world. This book is one more instalment in his apparently endless series of tomes berating clean air and water. Basically, the book boils down to Arnold's outrage at the fact that environmentalism has value, and can compete for the dollars of good citizens, who use their economic clout (through foundations) to protect the environment. The book proves the maxim: capitalists want capitalism for everyone but themselves. Arnold can't stand the fact that environmentalism successfully competes in the marketplace and the marketplace of ideas. His response, as always, is to insult. A thoroughly disagreeable book, and a worthy addition to the Arnold repetitive oevre of industrialism for industrialism's sake."
3,Beware of inaccuracies even at non-technical levels,"There are numerous inaccuracies such as page 53 that states that BT range is NOT affected by walls, doors or other solid objects. This is so basic an error and important that one must wonder about anything this book states."
1,RUBBISH,"WORST piece of garbage ever put on film! Production value is like a bad 70's after-school special. NOT a thriller or suspenseful in any way. The score had me laughing, I think it may have been tracks from the Barnababy Jones TV show. It's a horror all right, horrible story, writing, plot, character development - you name it. Aside from the fact that Jody Foster is very good in her roll - this was worse than sitting through ""Water World"" again."
5,Good stuff from the teen Jodie,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a teen. It creeped me out then (the Martin Sheen character), and still does today. But Jodie and her boyfriend play great parts. I believed that a girl that young could be that smart."
3,No phone lifter included,This package does NOT include the lifter - you really want to check this out before buying this model. Without the lifter you have to manually lift the handset off the phone and place it on the desk to answer or make a call - and you cannot answer the phone while walking around your office/house. I would suggest buying the package with the lifter.
5,Love it,"Knew Ide love it when I saw the picture of it. Its really cute. Not too tall, has a small lamp shade but that doesnt make it less attractive."
5,Perfect,"I'll leave this short and simple.This movie is raw, its well written, the hardcore pornography isnt important to the storyline, but personally i think it works in the movie's favour to add to the grittiness of it.If this is generally not you're opinion, i wouldnt bother with this version."
2,Unreasonably bland,"Great story, terribly executed. A real chore to get through, and not for it's ""harshness"", but for my ability to refrain from pressing the fast forward button. Now, I'm not the kind of egg yoke for brains that has to have non-stop action to keep me entertained, but really, this movie is slower than a slug with a slipped disk. That, and the almost complete lack of musical score make this would be awesome movie extremely boring. No doubt the story is indeed powerful, and yes harsh, it is the way in which it is told that makes it so unenjoyable.yawn..."
1,edited,I hate buying stuff that's edited they need to be clearly marked don't buy if you have seen the original you will be disappointed
1,Thriller--An Overrated Picture,"I'm having a really hard time understanding why anyone likes this movie. I was expecting so much, given some of the reviews here and the Tarantino seal of approval. ""Roughest revenge picture ever???"" Quentin obviously hasn't seen ""Irreversible."" If you're looking for a good revenge picture, please buy that instead of this. It has everything this movie has but is actually good. Hardcore sex--yep. Violence--yes, and it doesn't look like your neighbor's teenage son did the special effects. And best of all, it's got people who can actually ACT. I frankly didn't give a damn when the lady in this movie gets abused because I can't empathize with a character when the actress has no talent. She was obviously only used because of her ""Eye Candy"" quotient--and frankly, she's not as hot as some people here think. Contrast this with the rape scene in ""Irreversible"", which had me cringing for about 8 minutes straight."
3,Chris & Tina get it right,"Finally, after several disappointing, amateurish albums, the Tom Tom Club lives up to its potential. Still lighter-than-air but not as corny as before, the chemistry is right...more infectious grooves, a more roots/funk sound, and better arrangements..lots of fun! It's great to see Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth score like this."
5,On Par With Jewel in the Palace,"After watching Jewel In The Palace (Dae Jang Geum) my Korean drama adventure had begun. Yi San was my second stop on this adventure andI was not disapointed. This story is about a King in the 1800's who fought for the people of his nation through thick and thin and never gave up, even after many assasination attempts. This series has it all, suspense,romance,comedy,action,,mystery and so forth. This series was actually suppose to only go 50 episodes, but because of the overwelming demand and love for the series it continued for 77 episodes.Each episode is 1 hour long, meaning this is a 77 HOUR movie. I spent some days staying up late just so i could see the outcome of events only wanting to watch more and more. It's that addicting."
1,Not the entire book!,This is not a complete version of the novel by Emile Zola. It ends in part 5 with Catherine coming out of the mine to the cheers of the people. This is Part 5 Chapter 2. The entire story of the strike and the resolution of the most significant drama of the book is MISSING! The actual novel ends in Part 7 Chapter 6. This version is a rip-off!
1,Germinal by Emile Zola,"As a native French speaker and having read Emile Zola in my teens (some years ago..) I am very disappointed to see words spelled without the accents! Not nice to read like this. Please, please correct this also for those who are learning French. I have always loved Emile Zola's books and wish to reread them but this makes it hard."
2,hmmmm,"I ordered the same exact cutains before and these are a dull yellow, not the same bright yellow I purchased before. Very dissapointed."
4,A True Dance Party!,"While many dance compilations try to please as many people as possible by combining as many different types of dance music as possible, all the songs on this CD work together wonderfully. The Amber song This Is Your Night is the highlight of this CD, but the songs by La Bouche, Taylor Dayne, Ace Of Base and Quad City DJs are huge party starters. The only annoying song here is the overplayed Macarena, but since it's the last song on the CD you can easily skip it. Even if you think this CD is older, still get it because it's still very enjoyable."
3,An ok dance CD,"This is an ok dance CD. Only about 4 good dance tracks worth the listen such as ""Who Do U Love"" - Deborah Cox, ""Be My Lover"" - La Bouche feat. Melanie Thornton, ""Dreamer"" - Livin' Joy, ""Beautiful Life"" - Ace of Base. The rest is basically pretty boring. Not a great dance CD, but still an ok one. Get this only if you like most of the tracks and artists on this dance compilation album."
5,Always in my CD player,"This CD is my favorite dance compilation. I listen to it again and again. The songs are mixed together very well so the transition from one song to the next is very smooth and natural. I usually skip by the rap songs, but the rest a gold."
2,Poorly written and badly bound,"The ""useable"" content of this book could easily be distilled down to 12-15 pages. Nichols uses the book as an opportunity to strike out against those that he feels have personally wronged him. The ""evidence"" that he draws on is heavily biased. His stated strategies are often contradictory and to top it all off the book literally fell apart...the binding is cheap. Don't waste your money."
1,Corporate Fascism,"Some don't believe that corporatism or corporate fascism is on the rise, I think this book only shows otherwise. Corporations believe that they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions, and regard the general population as unwashed heathens for which they are to exploit... it's the new fascism, american style!"
1,Poorly Written Corporate Diatribe,"Mr. Nichols no doubt feels upstaged by his more eloquent business partner, Eric Dezenhall, and his writing ability. As he well should. I do battle with some of the same groups he describes in his book and though some of his tactics may be applicable, his hysterical and poorly thought through style of writing forced me to ignore the better parts of the book and just struggle to get through it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Rodney's good...,"I was going to rate this three stars but I saw they'd removed one of the sections (to the DVD's benefit). Then I was going to rate it 5-star rating but then I saw Gaiam put their retarded ad (which you can get around by pressing the dvd menu button as soon as you can when the dvd is playing) at the beginning. Cut the crap out Gaiam! You're pissing people off. You know... people who will BUY YOUR PRODUCT!!Rodney Yee is a great yoga instructor and the DVD is worth buying for his AM Yoga if not for anything else. I'm glad they took Susan Deeson's ""Stress Relief"" yoga section out because she has the most God awful ingratiating tone in her voice when instructing. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, not as ingratiating or annoying as Deeson.I recommend this DVD, especially since Susan Deeson isn't on it anymore. It's fantastic and it will relax you or give you a great warm-up before moving on to more yoga."
3,I could lie down for free..,"Having recently discovered a 5:00 a.m. yoga show, I quickly came to love it. Of course, being the night owl that I am, waking up so early was getting a little hard, so I decided to buy this DVD. My show is an hour long. This DVD, if you don't count the introduction, is 30 minutes long. The morning is 15 minutes, as well as the evening section. I like the evening section more because it is the harder positions, whereas the morning is mostly lying on your back and sitting for meditation. I enjoy yoga because of the stretching, which is why I do not prefer this portion. But at a low price, I have no qualms with this product."
4,Excellent Place to Start,"This was a fantastic dvd for me when I was just starting out with Yoga, and it worked for me for a long time. It is kind of along the lines of the Yoga for Dummies video, except more tastefully done, and better looking boxcover, so you don't feel like such a dummie for using it. When you are ready to step up to a more strenuous workout, I would advise trying the Pilates dvd series, whihc you can also get here on ama zon. They take you to places that this dvd could never get you to, just like the ""New Sex Now"" dvd will take you to places far beyond regular sex and the regular sex instruction dvds will ever go."
3,NOT VERY GOOD,WIERD A.M. YOGA- NO GOOD.... P.M. IS BETTER BUT THE ALOT OF THE C.D. IS MEDITATING>>>NOT YOGA
4,A.M. and P.M. Yoga for Beginners,"When I ordered this DVD, I was not sure that I would be able to do even the beginning basics of Yoga, but this was very good for beginners. As of yet, I am not able to do all of the positions, and probably never will be able to do them all, but I can do enough to feel good about it."
1,Disappointing,"This should be titled pre-beginner. The morning exercise hardly even gives you a stretch. It really is just a waste of time. The afternoon exercise is a little more of a stretch, but neither is close to being a good solid yoga stretch/workout. I am just a beginner, but this is totally a waste of time and very limited energy."
5,Great Video!,This is a great video for everyday use and for any fitness level. I use it just about everyday and love it.
3,Good one for beginners.,"I was a bit disappointed in this dvd. Its great for beginnings, which I am, but I wished it would have either been longer or had more ""routines"". I think its something I will tire of quickly."
2,eh,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a couple short workouts to fit into my weekdays, but the advertisements that you HAVE to watch have done nothing but irritate me. They suck up time I don't have, defeating the purpose of the DVD. The workouts themselves are fine, although I expected a bit more guidance since it also says it's for beginners. I think their teaching style just isn't right for me, I like to be reminded to keep my back straight, to release/hold my breath as I perform a certain pose, etc. These two like to use their pose terms, which doesn't mean anything if I have no idea what that means. Also, there are only French subtitles - no English."
4,Great DVD for Beginning Yoga!,The AM yoga is very gentle and a great way to start the day. The PM yoga is more challenging and works you a little bit more.Good DVD to try when you want to start a yoga routine.
5,Easy and invigorating way to begin your day,AM PM yoga is an easy and invigorating way to begin your day as well as the prelude to a wonderful nights rest in the evening.
3,Good for the morning but the evening is a dud.,"The guy is really wonderful and easy to follow but the girl is like a circus freak with her fabulous ability to bend and stretch and fold up in half. Hey, this is supposed to be Yoga for Beginners not contortionists. I cant follow along with her. My tendons scream out with pain so forget about PM go to the circus instead and watch the acrobats. AM is very nice and pleasant and easy to do. Oh, where will I find the perfect yoga dvd? Also everytime you use the dvd you have to go through the ads and advice and junk before you get to the AM or PM. There has to be something better than this one. Rodney Yee is pretty good."
4,do any time of the day,"I have owned these for years (vhs and then dvd version) and have suggested others purchase them. The queing leaves a lot to be desired;however, I believe any beginner and even the experienced yogi will enjoy these quick and relaxing videos. I generally tell people to use the AM in the evening before bed since I think it helps a busy person wind down; but, if you suffer from stiffness in the morning then I do recommend the AM to be used then."
1,End your day annoyed,"I really wanted to enjoy and appreciate this program. I am a longtime fan of Rodney Yee, and I like some of his other work very much. For me, the trouble was with the P.M. section -- I found Patricia Walden to be so incredibly annoying that instead of growing relaxed and ready for restorative sleep, I got more and more tense. Her instructions were unhelpful and even though the poses were quite basic, I found myself getting turned around, and even felt physically uncomfortable at times, simply because the directions were unclear.Simply put, this is just not good. I'll try Rodney Yee's other work, but the next time I see Patricia Walden's name associated with a project, I will be certain to give it a miss. I wish I could return this disk, but unfortunately, the fact that the program itself is defective does not qualify as a reason for a refund."
5,am/pm yoga excellent for the beginner!,"Rodney Yee keeps his yoga relaxing, gentle and to the point. Perfect for the begginer as well as the experienced yoga student the 15 to 20 minute time factor makes it easy to fit into any ones routine. Wheather it's am or pm now you have no excuse not to have yoga become a part of your excercise protocol. And the price works too!"
4,Great intro to Yoga,"As I age, it's harder and harder to get up in the morning. And stress of a busy, traveling work schedule is gruelling. This tape has really helped start the day out right with gentle stretching and light meditation. I find I am taking it with me on business trips and even on vacations to start my days. I am, however, not as thrilled with the PM session. Probably just me, though. It's a fine evening ""cool-down"" from the day but I just didn't care for her voice as much as Rodney Yee's in the morning. No reason why you couldn't do the AM portion in the PM as well. I would definitely recommend this, especially for those who have not done much yoga previously."
1,The first one is the best!,"I was like about 8 years old when I saw Ghostbusters 2 in the theater and I really enjoyed it. But a couple of years later it gotten kind of dumb and boring. I have to say I like the first one. The new edition to the first Ghostbusters on DVD is great. It has alot of great features like theatrical trailers, making of, deleted scenes, and the tracks and trivia. The tracks and trivia is my favorite because you'll find out of what really happened during the movie. I hope they make a Ghostbusters 3 soon, that would be awesome. I think Bill Murray is hilarious and so is Dan Aykroyd. But there not that funny in the second one. The second one just has references to the first Ghostbusters except for the jello scene. If you don't have any of the Ghostbusters movie stick with the first one because it's great, the second one is not very good."
4,Ghostbusters 2,No problem with this pre-owned copy. We got this movie because my daughter watched it on Netflix but then it wasn't available anymore.
4,A good film but NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"I've always liked the film. Saw it in the theater.The cast is still perfect in their roles.Good film BUT NOT CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.The story was lacking Dana got married & divorce between films & has Oscar. So, The spark between her & Peter was lost.Bill you can NOT beat his performance in both films as Venkman.The DVD package. Lack of anything special. NO EXTRAS EXCEPT 2 EPISODES OF THE ANIMATED SHOW. CHEAP.REAL CHEAP.They did NOT even add a trailer or anything else. No video for the Bobby Brown song. Nothing.Next time we release the film on DVD LET'S DO A BETTER JOB. YOU GUYS DID NOT EVEN TRY."
3,"""I thought it was going to be He-Man!""","The Ghostbusters are at it again in this 1989 sequel. This time, the Ghostbusters are up against a painting with an evil spirit living in it. The spirit is a ghost of a powerful magican by the name of Vigo. Vigo wants to live again, and to do that he needs a child. Vigo is helped by a museum worker.Meanwhile, the ghostbusters find some strange slime under the streets of New York and quickly finds out the slime reacts to human emotions. This slime is made from all the evil that goes on in NYC (""Hey, New York, what a town"")."
3,A good guide book but -,"There is a lot of practical information on getting around in the country packed into this guidebook, as well as a concise but illuminating summary of Poland's complex history. Although the book is filled with pictures and brief descriptions of key sites, we found it only modestly useful in prioritizing the things we most wanted to see and in laying out an itinerary."
1,Purchase not deliverd by Amazon.com,"I can not make any review as I did not received till now, August 3, the book I have purchased.RegardsRoberto Coimbra"
1,Bring your iron,"Crumpled. Gave to son. Wore one time at convention and left in hotel room as wife doesn't iron, or do much of anything else."
4,Worth the money!,Its not wrinkle free as it says. But even then its worth the money. Ideal for u if u are the kind of person who can not wear the same clothes for a long time.
4,Good shirt for the price.,Summer wear. Very thin which some may like some may not. Good for the value. Decently wrinkle free and easy to iron. Color is pretty crisp as well.
3,cheap but not bad,"i bought this shirt only for $5 so i am happy with the price. After i got the shirt, i was surprise with the shirt because it is not relaly bad for $5 shirt. the color look good and the thread quality is not bad but a little bit thin. But i dont like the way they fold and knit the shirt with needles. FOr $5 shirt , this is not bad."
5,Smash hits and tight harmonies,"One of the best of the recent reissues put out by BMG's catalog division is this 2 CD set of the Fifth Dimension's best. All the hits(big and small) are included. The colorful packaging and the well annotated booklet are impressive, but what really knocked me out was how good these songs sound. If you've bought any of the other Fifth Dimension CD's in the past you know the sound quality left a lot to be desired. All of the songs here have been remastered from the original first generation master tapes which have been in the possession of the group's producer/engineer Bones Howe all these years. The end result is stunning with the music coming out so bright and clear you can practically reach out and touch it. Because this group had many great songs that weren't singles and may have not been included, the reissues of the original albums are terrific too(and include bonus tracks), but the majority should be more than happy with this great compilation."
1,Faulty mastering,"I am disappointed with the mastering on this cd. Many of the tracks have little 1/2 second pops of noise right at the beginning of the song. It sounds like there was some problem with the digital conversion. It's very noticeable with headphones. With ""Up up and away"", it sounds as if the very beginning of the song is sliced off. A couple tracks have very quick unnatural fades.I think junior engineer ""Johnny Presto"" was given the duties to hurry this project out. The overall audio quality is very degraded from the original vinyl release of ""Greatest hits on earth"". This is very noticeable with ""One less bell to answer"". The original recordings of this group are clean, clear and lusciously transparent. It's a shame this CD does not reflect that. I would steer away from this release."
2,Soulless effort,"I guess I have a minority opinion but I cannot find as much excitement over Whitney's voice at all. OK, it is very strong and clear, it can sing very high and very low. But does that make a good voice, does that make expression? To me, Whitney's voice does not sound sensitive nor does it sound pleasant. To me, it's rather a voice with a huge lack of expressional character. It expresses nothing to me but a woman who wants to break all chords and alter the music business into an olympic competition for breaking chords. Also the Georgia Mass Choir is somewhat disappointing, I've heard some good RnB and Gospel but this album is one scream to me. There is no spiritual softness here rather an unbalanced attempt to pump religion into a commercial record. Religion as an individual process is not promoted in here. Also the non-gospel Whitney songs on this album are kinda weak and sound fairly hypocritical to me. If u want a good gospel album pick Mahalia Jackson."
5,Great price!,I love this soundtrack and had to replace my CD after some one stole mine. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who loved the voice of Whitney Houston.
5,Preachers Wife,"Loved, Loved, Loved the movie and now I can listen to those great and wonderful songs that Whitney has made famous."
4,Soul Shining,"Here it is: the gospel album she's discussed for years- and it is every bit as good as we hoped it would be!The Spirit moves while she wails ""I Go To The Rock""! And for secular love songs ""I Believe in You and Me"" stands among her classics. Friends join her on ""Somebody Bigger Than You and I"" and it satisfies the soul.A couple of weak cuts by Babyface and Diane Warren keep this from 5 stars, but this CD is a keeper!Give us more gospel!"
2,Twins Lie Bleeding,"Exactly just how many ""greatest hits"" albums are going to be released from this greatest band of the 80's? Do we really need so many different CDs with the same songs on them? How about getting some of those videos (""Single Vision"", ""Into The Gap Live"", etc) digitally remastered onto DVD!!!"
2,You gotta be kidding,"The greatest hits of the Thompson Twins? You gotta be kidding. What's next? The greatest hits of Bianca Castafiore, perhaps? Will Captain Haddock sing an aria about the Ancient Mariner, backed up by Professor Calculus on guitar?I remember this band. It wasn't funny. ""King for a Day"", ""Revolution"" and all that stuff.And those haircuts...In Sweden, nobody understood their name. People always said: ""They're not really twins, you know"".Well, obviously not. But that's another show.Bianca...?"
5,Legacy of Phyllis Hyman,Phyllis Hyman is one of the greatest R&B/Jazz artist of all time. If she was still alive she would still be going strong.
3,A Bit Of A Disappointment... But Still Pretty Good!,"The thing that bothered me the most with this Soundtrack was the fact that several of the songs appear two or three times on the CD in some sort of variation. I sat there listening and I kept thinking. ""Haven't I already heard this song?"" The songs have a good beat... although not very ""African"" sounding. I would have also liked to have seen more than one artist singing the songs... I like Phil Collins, but where's the variety? I collect all the soundtracks to Disney Animated films so I will gladly keep this one in my collection... however it probably won't see as much playing time as the others."
4,It's got a lot of beat!,"Now, I'll admit, I'm not much of a Phil Collins fan, but the Tarzan soundtrack IS very good. I really hate Trashin' the Camp, though, and I think N' Sync was a waste of good talent for such a stupid song. I adore ""You'll Be In My Heart"", though, and also ""Son of Man"" and ""Two Worlds"". I really wish that they had more songs be that were sung by the characters, though. All in all, cool soundtrack."
2,Unlike other Disney-Soundtracks,"If you liked the Lion King soundtrack, the Beauty And The Beast soundtrack and the Hunchback score (like I did), you might think that the Tarzan-music should be enjoyable, too. However, Marc Mancina does not even come close to the standart Hans Zimmer set with 'Lion King' and the whole album sounds more like a Phil Collins-CD than a soundtrack (with only 3 songs being written by Mancina alone). You'll be surprised not to find any song performed by the Tarzan-cast--and might as well listen to your older Collins-tapes!"
4,Good Soundtrack,"Well, this soundtrack is great - all the songs my daughter and I love from the movie are there, and it's great to hear them. There are two versions of ""Trashin the Camp"" - the song by the gorillas playing items in the camp - but one we didn't like much is a studio mix, not in character voices or from the movie. It doesn't work for us!"
4,Product was as advertised,The product shipped quickly. Product details were specific. Product was what we needed at a reasonable price. I will shop here again.
1,NOT REAL SONG LIST INFORMATION,"THE SONG LIST THAT APPEARS ON THIS PAGE FOR THIS ALBUM IT'S NOT TRUEI DON'T KNOW WHY THIS CD DON'T HAVE THE RAVEN AND [THE SYSTEM OF]DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER.IF YOU LIKE THE COMPLETE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF ALAN PARSONS PROJECT DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM,PLEASE BUY THE USA VERSION OF THIS CD."
4,"Good, Not Great","The Alan Parsons Project released several incredible albums in the late 70s, after which the band lost momentum and became something less than what it had been. The great albums include ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination,"" ""I Robot,"" ""Turn of a Friendly Card,"" and to a somewhat lesser extent, ""Eve"" and ""Pyramid."" The Definitive Collection contains good sounding renditions of many classics from early days, when the band was at its best. The first disc is incredible. Not a bad song. Disc two is disappointing. There's way too much stuff from the 80s. This just isn't the band's strongest material. I'm thinking more songs from ""Tales"" and ""Robot"" should have been included. As result, this is a good, not great, collection. Buy it, but know it could be better."
4,"Comfortable, but shocking","I've had a pair for about three months now. I'm notoriously fickle about shoes, but these quite fit the bill for me. I have wide feet and I'm often a perfect 8.5, which can make fitting difficult. A set of these in 9 seemed a bit long, and tight across the arch of my feet. Less than a couple of days of wear and they fit like a glove.We're only part-way through a very mild winter, so I can't say much about weatherability. They seem to hold up well to my rather aggressive use. Scuffs are minimal, and the lace eye inserts have held fast. The leather upper seems high-quality, and supple. The moderate tread has kept me from slipping on snow-covered streets. The sole is made of rather soft material, and I am noticing some wear already.I have to add, though: these shoes are shocking. Say after 5 minutes working at my desk touching any metal is a static-charged affair. None of my other shoes do this ... so it has something to do with the Rockports."
4,awesome product!,The product was great. It cleaned my laptop screen with no problems. Will purchase this product again once I run out.
4,I like it,"This is a great little book. Good examples. I just wish it was a little bigger for the price I paid, but I'm glad I got it."
3,Gazza's forever love,"Gary Barlow has an excellent voice & amazingly it keeps getting better with every new effort. Although I had high expections of this album, which it didn't live upto Gary has still managed to excel. The title track is fantabulous & inspirational with precise lyrical poetry. Other favourites include Forever Love, a gem of a song, the haunting Never Knew, the nostalgic Are you ready & even a song like Everthing I ever wanted shows Gary's variety in style simply because he's never attempted music like that before. All & all it's worth the buy but Stonger Now will definitely be an even better, I say 5 star album"
2,"NOT ""WHERE TIME BEGAN""","It's kind of amusing that everyone thinks that this version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH starring EMO PHILLIPS is actually the spanish film WHERE TIME BEGAN. Of course it does not help that MGM and AMAZON have listed the credits for WHERE TIME BEGAN, which is also an adaption of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH. This film is actually from 1988 and I think even more obscure than WHERE TIME BEGAN if such a thing is possible.I bought this version knowing it was not WHERE TIME BEGAN. I wish it was WHERE TIME BEGAN because I love that film. I have never seen this 1988 version starring comedian EMO PHILLIPS but I have always wanted to."
1,Obsolete - j2ee 1.4 beta,"Bought this book just to play around with j2ee14 sdk. I found this book is written using a beta version of j2ee 1.4. The book examples does not work with the current version of j2ee 1.4 sdk and authors confuse the readers with their own assumptions on j2ee14, showing some sample snippets without appropriate documentation. I find once you try using this book you are able to do nothing with the current version of j2ee."
5,"Outstanding, ""Definitive"" though would require a box set.","I suppose if you had to have just one Eric Carmen CD, this would be the one. Ever track is classic EC and a good sampling of songs throughout his career, particularly the singles. Be advised that this disc is contagious. A couple of listens and you're going to want more, in fact all 4 Raspberries albums, and all 6 solo albums. Eric Carmen is the most underrated and misunderstood singer/songwriter/performer of his time. His infectious melodies are custom made for the most expressive voice in the biz. This disc goes along way to demonstrate EC's versatility, effortlessly moving from scorching rockers such as ""Tonight"" and ""Go All the Way"" & ""That's Rock and Roll"" to smooth as silk ballads such as ""Boats Against the Current"", ""Desparate Fools"" and the famous ""All By Myself"". Take a listen and you'll be amazed. The liner notes are great. This guys got class, and boy can he write, sing, and play."
4,Something is different,"Excellent CD, although a few points should be made. Boats Against The Current is adifferent verson from the original version. It has a backing chorus, some listeners might enjoy it as an enhansment. Also, I Want To Hear It From Your Lips is missing. It is the only charted single from the Geffin album. The song chosen to represent that album is a good one, but not a greatest hit. That's all. Enjoy as I have done."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I have enjoyed all of Howard Frank MOsher's books, particularly NORTHERN BORDERS. This book is a great addition to his work. The stories about the people of Kingdom County are sagacious, loving and enchanting. I thought the book started a bit slowly, but it ineluctably gained steam, getting better and better, and it culminated in a magical, wonderful way. Mosher's descriptions of small town life in northern New England evoke a nostalgic era that has passed, and his portrait of the North Country itself is vivid. This is a magical, marvelous book, and I hope it is a success for Mr. Mosher."
3,"Fun, but please don't take this one too seriously","This was a fun read. If you want depth, read ""Stranger in the Kingdom"" by Mosher. But the characters in THIS book were too outrageous to take TOO seriously. Yet each character was remarkably interesting and quirky. A little campy at times,and certainly they behaved in unrealistic ways but that's what made this book fun. You had no idea what would happen next. I liked it- it was a great beach book."
1,I was not impressed at all,"The book seems to me like a random collection of obvious statements; however, it is possible I missed the point. Either way, I did not learn anything useful from this book."
5,"Excellent value, great box set!","As other reviewers have noted, this is a very well-executed box set collection. The current prices on it from Amazon sellers are a steal. Hopefully if you are looking at this product you are a fan of this genre and appreciate the older movies. If you are, you will love this set. The picture quality is better than most of the previous releases of these films and it is all presented in anamorphic widescreen in Japanese with English subs (although there is an international cast that speaks English at times in Fifth Level Fist). The included booklet is great for fans! I just wanted to add a five star review to bolster what others have already written."
1,Item misrepresented / categorized,"The pictured and described item adapts NEMA 5 20R male to a NEMA R32U male. While the shipped item adapts NEMA R32U male to NEMA 5 20R male.So far I'm out return shipping cost.The actual item seems of sufficient construction, but if you need what's pictured here, you probably won't get it.Interestingly the stuff you ordered list that amazon maintains links this image: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31kvmlr3sEL._SS100_SS100_.jpg Which is what they shipped."
5,Excellent tool,"I needed to replace two sets of old leaking bathroom faucets. They were some 40 years old and the big fastening nuts below were rusty. Removing the old faucets was a tough job. The smaller basin wrenches that I could get in local stores were too small. So, I got this bigger Ridgid basin wrench. Its jaws could just fit into the tight space. I was amazed to find that the teeth could bite so well onto the nut that I could apply a lot of torque without slipping. After applying a bit of WD-40 on the rusty nuts, and with the help of a 18"" steel pipe added onto the T bar at the end of the wrench to increase the torque, I managed to loosen the nuts. Without this wrench, I would have to hire a professional plumber for the job."
3,"Can't tell much from the ""Look Inside""","I probably shouldn't have put any stars on this because I don't actually have this book, but I just had to say somthing about the way this product was presented in the ""Look Inside"" feature. The publisher apparently didn't want any of the images in the book shown in the preview. You couldn't get any idea of what the projects really were!Terrible way to market your book. I wouldn't take a chance on this book on a bet."
3,well done,"An engaging fiction tale. I might have forgotten I was reading a romance! Excitement (begining had an Oliver Twist feel). Enjoyed the fun & play. Loved the settings. I adored all the characters.Easy to get into. Smooth writing-style. Real adverture, more so than most romance. This was just my first KR book, I'll be getting all her stuff."
1,Apologetics disguised as philosophy,"This book, a modified version of the author's philosophy doctoral thesis, is actually a text of Christian apologetics. It steadfastly evades strong empirical arguments which would successfully overcome its position and ultimately provides little that would be convincing absent an a priori acceptance of theistic premises."
5,Kicks My Wife's Butt,"I bought this for my wife who requested it so that she could do a barre workout on days when she was having to miss a class because of work. Well, from what I heard this isn't your typical ballet barre but it IS typical Cathe, with a new prop. Low impact yes, low intensity, no. I repeat this secondhand, but judging by the sweat, it's a great workout."
5,Such a cute movie!,"Reese Witherspoon did such a great job playing Elle Woods. Sure, the plot is a little far-fetched. Come on, airhead girl who works her ass off to get into Harvard Law actually gets in....and she only does it to try and get back with her ex boyfriend! She goes through hell when she's there and then....okay I won't spoil it, but this movie really is cute though. It's so not real. Hence, the perfect movie!"
4,Good piece of fun,"... It has a university comedy film without drinking, gross sex scenes or anything else. Playing Elle Woods, the ditzy heroine, Witherspoon carries the film through a series of impossible turns as she conquers Harvard law school. Drawing on the dumb blonde characters made famous by Marilyn Monroe and others, Witherspoon charms her way through a lovely piece of fluff. It has no social commentary of any kind. My lawyer wife groaned through the trial scenes as they became more ludicrous. The final cross examination is just hilarious.I had a cold when I watched it and it met the intellectual depth I needed at that time."
4,"Just an FYI, ""bend-and-snap"" doesn't work unless you are a blonde!","As funny as this movie has remained, over the years, it still can't capture the greatness of Reese Witherspoon's performance until you watch her in other movies. Watch her in ""Just like Heaven"" or ""Rendition"", Witherspoon still has so much to give.P.S. don't try the ""bend-and-snap"" move if you are over 35 years old; nobody is watching... even if you are a blonde!"
4,It's so cute!,"When I began watching this movie, I thought it was kind of waste. Silly and unfunny. But it wasn't. Oh, yesssssss! It, really, wasn't. I have enjoyed this movie. Reese Witherspoon is wonderful. She's so beautiful and talented. Of course, it would never become a classics. Screenplay is not original, actors sometimes are overacting, but... But I really LIKE ""Legally Blonde"". It is one of the brightest pictures, I've ever seen."
2,There Is A Thin Line Between Funny and Just Plain Dumb...,"And Legally Blonde is more dumb than anything. I just watched this film to see the big praise for it, assuming it might be funny. I found myself hating it more than anything. Reese acts like such a ditz in this film that at times it really annoyed me and the storyline itself was silly with only a few okay parts that could in no way save this film. And I heard there is a sequel to this film? Oh no.I know this is supposed to be a feel good movie but come on everyone has to admit it is more stupid than anything. And I can't believe Reese wants to be remembered like that. Thankfully she has done other movie roles that are much better.Anyway, for people who have not seen it, don't expect much intellectual stimulation. It's pretty simple and foolish and Reese acts like the stereotypical blonde in the beginning who becomes smart in the end- case closed basically."
2,Now wasn't that fuuuuun...(note sarcasm),"If you are looking for something completly mindless....you found it. For me watching this was like pulling teeth, no matter how many good reviews it gets....I wouldn't recommend this to my dog."
3,Entertaining Fluff,"What can you say about this film? It is enjoyable enough. It certainly isn't a movie that you can hate. I did get a bit tired of that fact that every character in the movie was a broadly-drawn caricature, but that is my only quibble.Three stars for the fact that 20 minutes after you've finished viewing it, you will have forgotten most of the details of the movie, even if you enjoyed watching it. Just rent it, don't buy it."
2,LEGALLY CONNED,"Seemes an utter waste of talent. Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair were the best part of the highly uneven CRUEL INTENTIONS. Seeing them back together should have been a delight. But in this movie the first plays just plain stupid and the second a jealous, not too likeable character portrayed too positively. But the main reason I felt legally conned by this is how it sells itself as light comedy. That lured me in for an easygoing two hours of movie, but that ain't what I got. I wasn't in the mood for heavy-handed delvings into cutthroat competition and sexual harrassment. And Blair's character was away too insensitive with the title character's plight with both to be the sort-of heroic character she's ultimate portrayed as. There's at least one character in the movie considerably less unlikeable than Blair's but mercilessly trashed in the end."
4,Hilarious!,"The ONLY reason this didn't get 5 stars was due to the underplaying of one of the lawyer's sexual advances toward Elle. I loved the movie, thought it was absolutely side-stitch funny, and wanted to rewind and watch it all over. Just the beauty shop scenes alone are worth the rental, or the scenes with Elle and her dog. Precious! Reminded me a bit of ""Troop Beverly Hills"" or ""Private Benjamin""."
3,Good Silly Fun,"This Hollywood vehicle for bigger-than-life actress (though it's p.c. now to say ""actor"" instead) Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly polished and funny, not the mindless hackwork one might expect from its marketing campaign. The story is shamelessly derivative, true, with obvious nods to THE PAPER CHASE, MY COUSIN VINNIE, CLUELESS, and, it's easy to imagine, any number of other movies I've missed. No matter: It's a hoot, and works fine on its own terms.It's entertainingly written, capably directed, and uniformly well-crafted in every area: acting, casting (several of the bit players are dead-on), costuming, set design, cinematography, editing. Not a ""deep"" film, but fun, with some hip, timely satire.Extras include a nice documentary short plus two different audio commentaries that provide considerable insight as to how a Hollywood production like this is put together. All in all, terrific light entertainment for the intelligent viewer."
2,"Special Features, missing... BUT all-in-all, a great movie","This DVD version of ""Legally Blonde"" is corrupt. They SAY it includes many many special features on the box, but when you open it and pop it into your DVD player, it does NOT have these special features:1) Deleted Scenes2) 2 Featurettes: ""Inside Legally Blonde"" & ""The Hair That Ate Hollywood""3) Hit Music Video ""Perfect Day"" By Hoku4) Original Theatrical TrailerWhat it DOES include, though, is this:1) 2 Audio Commentaries Featuring Robert Luketic, Reese Witherspoon, Marc Platt & Film Crew2) a Trivia TrackIf you want ""the whole enchilada"", I strongly suggest you don't buy this DVD. It's a waste of money and a big fake.On the upside, though, ""Legally Blonde"" is 'a feel-good girl-power [movie]'. It's one of my favorites and it should be your's too! Some parts are hilarious and the plot is great too. If you just want to buy this DVD/movie just for the sake of enjoying the movie, then I'd say ""GO FOR IT!!!!!"" :)"
3,More Decent than I Expected,"I'll admit that I went into this expecting fluff, and that's exactly what I got. But at the same time there WAS a decent story (better than I can say about most frilly films nowadays) and there is something very empowering about the ending, sort of a reverse Grease effect, that had me grinning."
4,A bit too gurly,"Not the best movie and way too cliche. However, it's okay I guess and it shows that a dumb blonde can make a difference. It's a bit off though because it's degrading Harvard and saying that practically anyone can get in."
3,LEGALLY TOLERABLE,"I really didn't know what to expect of this when I rented it, but being the deranged movie maniac I am (in the nicest possible way) I plunked down a whole NZ$3 (which is probably something like 30c US) and took the durn thing home, grabbed a nice cold beer and slammed it into my VCR. For a while, my friends; it was heavy going: giggly dopey airheads saying ""like"" endlessly. But I persevered.... and things got better. Sure, the ending is so stupid and unlikely that you will be rolling your eyeballs toward the heavens, but this story of a blonde bimbo who becomes a lawyer to prove to her ex-boyfriend there's more to her than being blonde and having a body you could eat off, is actually quite likeable, in large part to Reese Witherspoon's performance (plus she looks really hot in a bikini too)."
4,Cute Escapism,"I found Legally Blonde to be the type of movie that helps you forget your troubles. Of course, that's what it's meant to do. The heroine is very blonde, very rich and devastated when her boyfriend, instead of proposing marriage, dumps her. So what does she do? Leave California behind and follow him to his prestigious law school, naturally. There, she will show them she's no dumb blonde. Her little dog is cute, too. An endearing little creature, if ever there was one."
4,Great movie for Courtroom Dramedy fans...,"I loved the movie. I thought Reese was wonderful. There are other comic oddities that you catch after viewing the movie a couple of times. It also has a pop-up video version that gives cool information about the movie, the stars and women in general. Overall a really great movie--considering the target audience."
2,Stupider for watching it?,"You ever watch one of them movies that you feel that you are just plain stupider for watching? That it had no point, it was a waist of your time, and just killed good brain cells? That was my opinion of this ""comedy"". I didn't even crack a smile once. This was a ""comedy"" correct? It wasn't a comedy. A comedy makes you smile,laugh, feel merry. Personally, I did not get any of those feelings from the movie. If you like slapdash comedies that should have went straight to video, then this is for you. However, if you want something with a little more depth... Try something else."
4,"Great, girlie movie","This is such a fun, girlie movie. For some reason, I really like these movies.. probably because there's no thought involved, just pure fun.This movie is about a girl, Elle who decides to go to Harvard law because to try and win back her exboyfriend. She discovers a few things about him and herself along the way.Grab your gal pals for a fun and entertaining movie!!!"
5,One of the best comedies of 2001,"This has got to be one of the best comedies I have seen this year.It was too perfect.Reese Witherspoone was perfect in this movie.The cast all did a perfect job in this movie.The movie was not only very funny,but it had a bit of a moral to it.The moral is to believe in yourself and thats a very good moral.If you saw Clueless and loved it,then you'll definatly love Legally Blonde"
3,Rhetoric class,"A student used a clip for this movie in her presentation on classical rhetoric for or rhetoric/composition class. It was the scene where the blonde is crossexamining the wintess and uses the witness's own words to prove she had lied. I plan on showing that clip in the future! The movie is cute, but not one I'd watch a doxen times."
4,A Surprisingly Funny and Witty Movie,"When my wife forced me to watch this movie, I originally thought that this was going to be a ""chick flick"" that I would have to sit through. I was sure that it was going to be a one-joke movie. I was pleasantly surprised.This movie was smart in delivery. There is no doubt that Reese Witherspoon carried this movie, and I doubt that anyone else could have. She was able to portray her ""ditzy blonde"" character as someone with true intelligence and confidence.While the very ending is a little lame, the entire movie is enjoyable and well worth watching."
2,Snoozer,"Hoping to find some new material in this movie, I was greatly disappointed. This is a retread of old ideas, about becoming, about dumb blonde jokes, about spoiled rich kid jokes, about nothing we haven't seen already a dozen times already. There were only two genuinely funny moments, other than that, it was time I'll never get back."
3,Good,"I just watched this film tonight. In my honest opinion, its a ""Clueless"" wannabe. I couldn't help but compare the two films, and I hate to say this film comes up short. But, Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous and did a great job. The plot is somewhat predictable, and alittle too convenient, but it still works. This is a feel-good, ""girl power"" comedy film.I would recommend this film to any girl/woman who has been dumped by someone they considered the love of their life. You just might feel better afterwards (for a while maybe)."
4,cute,I was expecting this movie to be another one of those dumb blonde movies. I was pleasantly suprised that there was an actual story line and a good ending.
4,Lots of fun,"Although the myth of the ""dumb blonde"" will live on after this movie, it was nice to see a film that celebrates human achievement over preconceived notions. The movie is upbeat, encouraging, and lots and lots of fun."
4,VERY FUN AND SATISFYING LIGHT-HEARTED COMEDY,"I'm glad I caught this movie today. ""Legally Blonde"" was very satisfying and gave me quite a few laughs. It plays kind of like a good 80's movie with its ""valley"" girls, ""flashy-pink"" tones and soundtrack. I hate giving storylines and plots away so just go see this one for yourself. I had a lot of fun watching it and I recommend it."
2,Didn't like the main character,"I liked Christopher right away but I was absolutely tired of Ellen within the first few pages. I HATE ""by the book"" , can't break rules type of people and that's what Ellen is (until the end of the book of course). I thought I would scream if I read ""he's not the one"" one more time. In fact, I started skimming the book pretty early on (I couldn't bring myself to just throw the book away because unlike Ellen, I can't afford to just buy books to throw them away. I feel like I actually need to read them.)I gave the book two stars because the mystery weekend was a pretty good setup even if nothing very interesting happened."
4,Huge improvement,"Having looked at the Sixth edition of this book, I nearly didn't bother with the Seventh. I'm glad I did. In the 7th edition of Hollinshead's Functional Anatomy of the Limbs and Back, David Jenkins has succeeded in covering almost exactly the knowledge area and depth for which I was looking. No other book I have found gives enough practical detail of the ""what"" of anatomy while maintaining a focus on the ""how"" and ""why"" of function. The level of understanding required does not exclude less academic students, while still covering the material in sufficient detail.Well done.NB: This book certainly is not out of print in Australia at least!"
3,short fit,"I have another surf shirt (O'Neil brand) and loved it. Wanted to get another one and thought this would be a good buy. It is made well but the length of the shirt is short. I'm only 5'8"" and thought a medium would be fine but it is short in length, about 2"" shorter than my O'Neil shirt. I like it but it just doesn't fit all that well. Guess that is what I get for buying clothes online form a brand I've never tried..."
1,Late for Christmas,"Wish I could tell you the plant was beautiful, but it didn't arrive before Christmas as promised. Delivery date was 12-23-2010. I ordered it 12-18-2010. It's Christmas day and my mother-in-law called to see if I got her present. Of course she said she didn't receive anything from us."
2,ok not the best,you like big boobs and kick ass girls that beat the piss out of guy this is the movie for you . poor story line and other then that I thought it was ok ! not great . but story line really suck when there is no story . sleep threw some of the movie!
4,guilty pleasure,"The type of movie you recommend only to 'special friends'. After all, you are admiting to real guilty pleasure here. It's offensive, violent, and absolutely not 'politically correct'. Yet compellingly sexy, clever, funny. And gods help me, watching those three women? It feels down right dirty. Yet I bought the movie anyway; they are just plain 'HOT'! Hence the guilt!"
4,A modern day B movie.....,"Attractive scantily clad women, guns, chick fights, explosions, gratuitous violence and gore. Seriously, what's not to like?"
5,T & A HOMMAGE,"From one of the producers of the 'Hercules' and 'Xena' Television series of the 90's comes this hilarious, over the top hommage to 'B' movie babes from the early silent screen to the present. The movie relentlessly assaults the senses through flashbacks, split screen images, and a powerhouse music soundtrack,to keep the viewer from catching a breather. Naturally, you will see 'Quentin Tarantino' nuances but the hard core viewer will see tributes to 'Russ Meyer', 'Jack Hill' and even 'Jess Franco' to keep this wonderful stew brewing. Cameos by 'Kevin Sorbo' and 'Lucy Lawless' and even 'Hercules' sidekick 'Michael Hurst' enhance the proceedings. Highly recommended to every fan who loves bitch slapping tough babes from 'Tura Satana' to 'Pam Grier'. You'll probably need a shower after the film concludes."
1,Not worth watching.,"This movie had better bits on a famous web sight. All of the action scenes were pretty pathetic and the worst part is they even say this is a better than average B movie. Stick with real low budget B movies and don't even wast more than $1000 US dollars if you want to make a real B movie. I will stick to older crappier movies that used to be shown at 3 AM twenty years ago for my entertainment. The women on this movie are great eye candy, but even that gets old quick since they don't show too much anyway. Not recommended unless you just have to collect movies like this. I thought with the way society has gone the last decade or so this might actually be a good movie, it isn't. Marina on her Hot for Words sight can keep having her guest on though. I am just not going to waste my time on this movie."
4,Title says it all,"I recomend this movie if your into terrintino/rodregez movies (i am, im just illiterate and too lazy to grab planet terror to see how its spelled) especially if you liked sucker-punch, its a guy movies that my girlfriend that was badass ""chris pandolfi"" reviews it best but if your lazy like me lotta blood, lotta booMs, lesbian love, one of the girls goes ape-$^*& crazy as the movie progresses (great acting) so read Chris's review and just buy it"
1,Really?,"This supposed ""B"" Movie is disgusting and pointless. I would give it an ""F""! Not even one of those movies you hope is going to get better if you just watch a little more. Feels hopeless and is! Save your money even if it is only $1.99! Mine is available for FREE you pay the shipping."
2,Not all it's slapped up to be - buy it used if you must,"This should have been the best B-movie ever, but it's not quite there. Never really stylish, the direction and editing are sloppy and ruin the few good scenes to be found. It's like a cheesy ""Tarantino Jr"" movie with annoyingly jumbled sequences and sadistic violence."
3,TERRIBLE BUT FUN,"It's not a very good movie, but who can resist not too attractive but very sexy girls in tank tops and denim short shorts?There is a very good Roman bath orgy scene"
1,Avoid this cheap junk...,"In all the years I have used laptops for work, I have never been motivated to actually buy my own personal laptop in addition -- until now. My company got me an IBM Thinkpad, and it's a piece of junk. It's so bad, I actually forked over $1800 of my own money to get a Dell. The Dell is lightyears beyond the IBM in every way. The IBM is less than a year old, and has already had the motherboard replaced under warranty. Everything about it screams ""cheap"", from the lousy keyboard, to the nearly non-functional touch pad (it constantly jumps around, causing you to lose just-typed text). I wouldn't buy one of these for $100. Remember, I warned you."
4,NotFredDurstFan,"Hey Fred Fan. Are you being facetious or are you really thatignorant. You can't be serious when you say that you like Springsteen's cover of the Manfred Mann song, Blinded by the Light. It is a known fact that Springsteen wrote the song and released it before Manfred Mann and that Manfred Mann covered this song along with 2 other songs from the Sprinsteen Asbury Park album subsequently. And puhleeeeeeezze, Bon Jovi????? Get real. Even Bon Jovi idolizes Springsteen. Springsteen is a legend and his music is timeless. His music has lasted 30 years and will last at least another 50 years MR. Duran Duran fan. Springsteen is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I would bet your life and mine that neither Bon Jovi or Duran Duran (both born in the black hole void of music known as the Eighties and MTV-style over substance years) will EVER be even considered for induction. Over and out."
2,Not essential,"Sony really got me down with this one. I've expected the real essentials, but got the expanded Greatest Hits package. With the exception of the third disc, of course. Where are the really essential songs that made Bruce an important songwriter? Songs like It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City, Wild Billy's Circus Story, Incident On The 57th Street, Jungleland, Downbound Train to name but a few? This is by all means a collection of great songs, but it's merely an expanded greatest hits collection and NOT a collection of essentials. So if you want hits, buy Greatest Hits for less money. If you want essential Bruce Springsteen, buy original albums and leave this collection alone!!!Two stars for the great songs, but then again two stars for misleading the people. There is more essential in Springsteen than that."
5,I don't understand,"Basically I want to say that I'm tired of hearing the whining from the ""die-hard"" fans. I am a die-hard fan as well, but it seems most can't figure out that the Essentials isn't for the die-hard. One day maybe they will"
2,"""Cover Me"" because ""I'm On Fire"" over this so callled essential release!","You can't have an essential Bruce Springsteen compilation without including 2 of his biggest hits ""Cover Me"" & ""I'm On Fire"" especially over 3 discs, it's just unheard of. These 2 songs were also left out of the other Bruce Springsteen greatest hits cd, for what reason I don't know but something strange seems to be going on here. I'm not going to buy this release either because i'm sure one day the people who put these cd's together will hopefully get it right, maybe on the next Springsteen Best Of perhaps!!"
4,Two hours of male beauty,"This documentary was shot while photographer Francois Rousseau was photographing 46 beautiful nude young athletic Frenchmen for a 2004 calendar. The calendar sold 1 million copies.The documentary is all in French and is not subtitled. It is filmed in black and white, which actually heightens the contracts between light and dark and shows the male body in the most flattering light.The documentary focuses on the models rather than the photograhpers and support staff. I guess this is the whole point, but while watching it you wonder what the make-up artists, the hairdressers, the lighting technicians were thinking. Some of the young men were obviously heterosexual whereas a few shots had homoerotic tension during the photography, but not overt sexual play takes place. The most interesting thing to me was how relaxed these nude men were around 6 or 8 photography staff.This 140 minute DVD is a tribute to young male athletic beauty. That is all you get, nothing more."
2,Steamy but Not Hot,"Erotic quality is there and the models are willing to show it off. Sadly for several reasons most of the ""making of"" is sensored to show almost no [...]. The models are obviously not embarrassed or shy and more than willing, on the contrary it is the producers/directors/editors that wanted to keep things G rated. I didn't expect [...] or sexual content, but I certainly didn't expect the film to stop when the pubic hair started. Judging from the BOOK, there was more [...] to be seen as it is a very important part of the male body and absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I do understand these are real people but I can't believe they are all prudes."
5,"Excellent text, totally accessible","If you are searching for the one uncomplicated text on electronic devices and circuits, then Bell will help. The author knows that the reader knows nothing. So he assumes nothing. And presents everything in an accessible way.Reading this book will give any student a clear idea of the basic concepts, with which one can attack a tougher textbook. I found reading this book enjoyable."
4,good,Great information. I love the history in this book. Would enjoy seeing the video some time also. I got one for me and one for my mother-in-law.
5,The Documented Truth of Our Founding,"America's Godly Heritage is a short booklet with a lot of information. Using the words of the Founders themselves, David Barton sheds light on the truth of America's founding. America's Godly Heritage is an excellent defense against the progressive movement's lies that America did not begin as a Christian nation. No other historian living today is more knowledgeable on the events and writings of our nations early history. It is evident that David Barton has spent years researching the documents and the letters of our 56 Founders.The book also gives evidence of our nations stray from our godly roots and the demoralization that has followed. David Barton uses the information to press the fact that we must return to our godly heritage by allowing God back into the public sector.America's Godly Heritage is a must read for anyone wanting to know and defend the truth our our founding."
2,Hard to eat,"They are very pretty- look like real pearls. But they are very hard and I'm afraid to use them on my cupcakes. Don't want anyone to break a tooth on these! Seller was prompt, and the photo is exact."
3,New Testament Greek,"This book is very hard to learn the N.T. Greek. Fortunately, I found another book by Mounce that allowed me to learn Greek. However, I did learn some things in English Grammar. Just not my cup of tea."
4,Does what it says on the tin,"Good product. Good customer service. Had a problem receiving the products originally, but the sellers helped resolve it professionally and courteously. Would buy from them again.Regards,Stan"
1,wont last long,"This item broke twice within two weeks from pretty light use. A shame, because I think it was hoping I could use it for a few months to help fix a hip running injury"
1,never got it,I really needed this poster for the holiday season but I never got it. Because of that along with several other gifts meant to be given for the holiday season I was out a significant amount of money because of my purchases and empty handed!
5,Classic,"Perfect for my movie room, the delivery was fast and you cannot beat the price. the colors for me was way better than I expected."
3,Good Poster but poor quality framing,The poster itself is great however after deciding to purchase the pre-framing service (which is not cheap) I didn't think the quality would be so poor. I recommend purchasing the poster from here and having the framing done locally.
1,RAY BROWN aka RAYMOND LONNIE STINNETT IS A FELON.,"IN THE OPINION OF THE READER THE PUBLISHER SHOULD NOT PRINT THE MATERIALS PORTRAYING ""HEROS"" WHO ARE IN REAL LIFE AND BY THEIR REAL NAMES FELONS. LAW ENFORCEMENT DESERVES MORE RESPECT THAN TO HAVE MR. STINNETT'S WRITING REPORTED AS TRUE CRIME. THE CREDIBILITY OF A FELON DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO 'TRUE CRIME' - OR DOES IT?"
4,A Satisfying Tale That Overcomes it's Faults,"This is the first novel I've read by Hogan. I was immediately hooked by the premise, and pleasantly surprised that the science held up so well after a decade.Can't really argue with many of the complaints voiced by other readers, and the book did drag on more than few times. Yes, there were some poorly fleshed-out characters and some vague plot points. I felt the central characters and main plot line were quite intriguing and very well done.I don't run across many novels that I wish hadn't ended--this was one of them. There doesn't seem to be a sequel, but I'd welcome one gladly."
5,One of THE best books I ever read!!,"I am a book snob. Name authors only is my rule. But through a strange series of events I found myself reading Sock Monkey Blues. This author packs a mighty wallop with a dynamite story line AND excellent writing style. There is action, intrigue, humor, and horror, all wrapped up into this one fine package.No other bad guy I recall comes close to the horrible Boneless Chuck. I highly recommend this book."
4,This is the album that started it all!,"The songs, ""Mandy"" and ""It's a Miracle"" got Barry's career started. The bonus track on the reissue is good too. My favorite songs are ""Mandy, Home Again, Sandra, Something's Comin' Up."""
2,RETURNED!,"First, let me say that I was very pleased with the look of this unit. It ""looks"" like REAL quality when you remove it from the box. That's about where the pleasure ends though. The radio stations don't program well (oodles of static). The sound quality was really bad and I initially planned to buy external speakers until it stopped working. Yep, I bought this unit as a Christmas gift and in 3 days, the recipient told me she walked over to the unit to hit stop on the playing CD and everything went black. She tells me that the carpet probably caused a charge that killed the unit but she wasn't sure. I sent the Crosley back to Amazon with my CD still held hostage. I was very pleased with Amazon though, they gave me a FULL refund, shipping and return charges included. I would buy OTHER brands from Amazon again."
1,Not worth the money,"I agree with the other reviewers who said the sound quality was extremely poor, not better than a clock radio. I was forced to use external speakers with the unit just to get an acceptable amount of sound. That is until the CD player completely died a year to the day that I bought it. I returned the unit and would not purchase another Crosley product"
3,the hot tools straightener,"This straightener is good cuz its really basic. It was the first straightener I got and it's good for that. However, if you want a good straightener, spring for one with ceramic plates.. it won't damage your hair quite as much as this one. But, it is a good straightener for basic upkeep and it doesnt smell like something burning like other straighteners i've used.When they say 1- year warranty, they mean it like clockwork. After a year it just doesnt work well and takes me twice as long to straighten my hair. But.. a one year warranty is better than others I've come across. Hope this helped."
1,NOT ANOTHER 1!!!,Heres another cd that umm... I don't know... sucks!!! maybe. All the songs on here suck ecept 1 called (Mesa Que Mas Aplauda). I mean it this cd reaks!!! There again I wanted a song and I thought the cd would be good but listining to the song clips to the other songs they sound so weak. Man it's like these people do a great song so they will become popular but then the other songs they do are crapy. Many artist are like this they just want to becaome popular for a song or to and make the rest of the cd sound horrible. Weird if you ask me wouldent you want people to like all your stuff not just a song or two. In this case only 1 song. I'm telling you the music these days!!! Well not worth it!!! Keep your money!!! Get somthing else. As for the final words on this album pity!!! trash!!! not worth it!!! i'm out el rato!!!
4,great floor mats,"Had a pair in a 02 Silverado that I thought were a little heavier duty than these new ones, but would still recommend these new ones. Great look and price."
2,BREAKING NEWS!!! THIS IS BORING...,"JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT. OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE! NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP!"
3,Good,"She has huge potential but none of the songs are that great. Her sister Ashlee is actually a better performer and has more edge in her songs and better lyrics or something. Overall, good but something missing in the songs or songwriting."
1,Produto no recebido,Fiz um pedido em abril de 2012 e até o momento os produtos no foram recebidos a data de hoje é dia 22/10/2012. Solicito esclarecimento imediato.
1,REALITY OF A BIMBO TOUR,"I cannot understand why people would buy anything by this brainless ,talentless bimbo. She cant sing a song without stupid vocal gymnastics,she cant say anything intelligent and she has a perpetual spaced out expression on her uncharasmatic face.Im sick of switching on the tv and seeing her and that equally boring and talentless ""husband"" of hers.Please avoid this tripe and support people who actually made it because of talent and not a slick marketing team."
3,A superb study on U2 creations,"Niall Stokes did perfectly well by compilling such precious informations on U2's songs. If you have any of the band's biographies published to date, you're not done not until you get this book. It contains fascinating stories on the writing of the music and lyrics. Thanks for writing and releasing it, mr. Stokes!"
1,Laughably awful...,"""Into the Heart"" takes equal turns being thick-headed and cheesy. It purports to be ""the stories"" behind the songs but it regularly is nothing of the kind. Instead it focuses at great length on how the songs were mixed-something probably interesting to somebody but not me. His greatest weakness is that Stokes seems to have no concept of the spiritual dimension of the band-a fact that strikes most critics as crucial to understanding U2's music. Though he has clearly interviewed Bono, the quotes that the author uses often seem ripped from their likely context to support whatever Stokes already believes about the songs. The photo captions are howlingly hideous-the type of joke your three year old would tell and you only laugh because you love. I love my three year old. I hate this book. Save your hard-earned cash. Shoot, save the cash you find in the cushions of your sofa!"
1,A good thing it was a gift,"Bought this as a requested gift. Kind of sick looking when I got it, but the receipant was thrilled with it."
3,Pearls,Very Hard could hardly bite through them. They looked great on the cake though. My daughter liked how they looked.
5,A book to be experienced. :-),"Buy it and read it for the experience.I first read of it as a new type of book called a ""graphic novel"".Don't ask about the plot, just read it...."
5,Fantastic,"This was an absolute heart wrenching beautiful story of life, and love and family and loss. Grief, compassion, strength courage and vengance. What a powerful story great to read and even better to see depicted on the screen. Hats off to Tom Hanks who played a very passionate and convincing role."
4,"""You are the Devil."" -- Mrs. Keller","It's a long fall from the control tower. And well beyond that of its mere physical dimension. Control Tower tells the tale of a tartuffe spiral into Hell amidst the roger-wilco's and ample libidos. Looking beyond the viewer's imagination at the closing curtain for story closure, perhaps we'll learn more in a sequel. Including that from a prescient but presently drugged-into-silence Mrs. Keller. OAO"
4,"Almost, But Not Quite","AWESOME! Finally all the great hits of a wonderful singer/songwriter in one collection. Actually, not ALL. This is a GREAT collection, but I'm very disappointed that a box set containing this many great works by an artist, has left out one of his greatest novelty records, ""Opal, You Asked Me."" I mean, if we're going to have all of this man's great hits in a box set, let's have ALL his hits, especially in a box set this size. I mean, it's not one of those dinky two or three disc sets that only showcases his very best works. This has 5 discs with literaly all his songs. With such a big collection, why would you leave out ANY of his hits? Nonetheless, a GREAT collection, just a letdown that all his works didn't get included."
2,Weak on Encore DVD,"Very weak explanations of Encore DVD (how to actually make a DVD). Also scaled down file sizes for multi-cam and synching, probably because Premier Pro 2.0 is very touchy in these functionalities with larger (more realistic) file sizes. The least Total Training could do is to discuss what to expect and the workarounds...such as having triple the required internal hard drive space.Also - you will get no help from the folks at Total Training - about anything."
4,"6 men, One House let the games begin!",I love the book. I thought at first I was going to regret buying it but when the book picked up its pace I was more interested in knowing who was going to kicked out and who was going to end up lovers. I recommend this book to anyone. Many of todays issues where put on the plats. The myths of gay men. Closeted men and more. I really enjoyed it. One thing I have learned from the book is in order to defeats the myths of gays we must defeat our inner critics and be who we are.
1,lame,"Just for the record, let me start by saying that I wasn't expecting a truly great piece of fiction prior to reading this book, I did however expect much more after reading ""Tricks of the Trade""---which I liked. Basically, the plot is cheesy and the characters are lame--I didn't really care for or about any of them. The ending was really bad, most of the characters fall madly in love and the bad guys end up being good guys with good jobs. I was very disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I kept reading on, wondering when the book would start getting funny. Never mind the silly plot and the paper-thin characters -- I thought I would at least take away some funny lines. The only thing I got out of the book was some idea of London's social and physical geography -- where South London lies in relation to Fulham and Camden. (Sophie Kinsella does it so much better in Confessions of a Shopaholic). Compared to almost any other British chick lit effort out there (except for Jane Green, another let down), Amanda's Wedding suffers in every possible way. I agree with the reviewer who suggested Marian Keyes -- by far a superior writer who's funny to boot."
4,Entertaining!,"Amanda's Wedding is entertaining to say the least. Despite the main character, Mel, being a little on the pathetic side, I found I could relate to some of her emotions. The book really comes into its own as she gets a backbone throughout the story. I do recommend this book for anyone who enjoys this genre because it is funny and enjoyable."
2,weak characters = likable?,"seems that the only strength found in any of the characters is negative: Amanda gets what she wants by being snooty and bitchy, Fran gets what she wants by being bitter and bitchy, and Alex, Charlie, and even minor character Steve each get what they want by being drunk (and somehow that = cute). Mel, on the other hand, is not bitchy and so gets walked on more times than you can count, as do Angus and Fraser. The myriad other British-30-something-neurosis books are much more entertaining."
5,Finally Lucy Returns For A Sixth Season of The Lucy Show!,"I am so happy! I am probably one of the biggest fans of The Lucy show so it makes me very happy that the official sixth and final season is coming to DVD October 9th!This season is Lucy's last season of The Lucy Show, later she created a sitcom with her real life children called Here's Lucy. All five seasons of Here's Lucy are on DVD now and season six should be coming soon.The Lucy Show and all of Lucy's other sitcoms are funnier and better than most sitcoms on the air today, so I am very pleased that CBS and Paramount are releasing them on DVD.I can hardly wait until this comes out! Please buy this season if you are a Lucy fan and it you're not, than you will become one after getting this."
5,Perry Mason-ites are happy!,"The series holds up quite well, even after all these years. Like Columbo, years later, we're never surprised that Perry wins, but the byplay between characters is excellent."
4,"Once a Perry Mason fan, always a Perry Mason Fan!","This show was lways an enjoyable Television series experience. Give me more episodes, although full seasons would be more preferable."
5,Another Great Season for Perry Mason,"Ever since the Perry Mason episodes became available, I have been buying these DVDs and enjoying them immensely. Perry, Della, Paul, even Hamilton and the irrascible Lt. Tragg (who gets billing but has not appeared in any of the 7th season) have become like family. Guessing who the murderer is becomes a pleasant game. Can't wait for Season 8."
3,Oh Hum,Oh Hum. Just that the series never caught my interest and I never missed them after they went off the air. Friends younger than me are very dedicated to them.Go figure.
4,Great Pedal but YOU WILL need a noise gate.,"As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again, you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as ""ACTIVE"" as this one. Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it."
4,In Case You Forgot: she's still the queen!,"I am so glad to see that after the flop of her latest new studio album, aretha got back on the right track!She ensured this one would have worked out at its best, even though her vocals are not that powerful anymore...She's carefully chosen among the best new producers of R'n'B and Soul and the result is this real nice compilation of new songs.You can feel the energy she's about to unleash directly from the titletrack, a one-woman work done by Lauryn Hill.From there on til the last track, Aretha soulfully glides thru upbeats (HERE WE GO AGAIN, I'LL DIP) to the usual ballads she accomplishes grandly - my favourite ones are IN CASE YOU FORGOT and EVERY LIL' BIT HURTS.NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN is an odd pairing with Puff Daddy and HOW MANY TIMES with David Foster.THE WOMAN is the closing track, and it spells out Aretha's motto: I am the woman and I am here to stay!"
2,Shameful and disappointing.,"Unfortunately, this CD is among Aretha's all-time worst albums. Shame on Arista Records' boss Clive Davis and the producers involved for trying to make Aretha Franklin sound like just another Hip-Hop artist--instead of giving her better material that would do an artist of Aretha's status justice!!! Only ""The Woman"" and ""How Many Times"" manage to NOT sound dated. Not surprisingly, this CD is now out-of-print."
1,"""CLOSURE"" HAS NEVER BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED ON DVD","This 2 disc version of ""Closure"" that is on sale here, is a bootleg version of the official VHS version that was released back in 1997, whilst it might look like the real thing just Google Nine Inch Nails ""Closure"" and you will see that although it was intended for release on DVD it never came about.Trent Reznor uploaded the original version(with extras) and a whole 2nd disc on to a bit torrent site back in December 2006 so somebody here has now knocked up their own version and making a profit off it. So don't be caught out, the original video was never even remastered in the end."
4,"NIN, NIN & more NIN",This vid is just brilliant. Well...tape 2 is anyhow. It has all the videos prior to the Fragile's release on it and they are all great in their own way. I love the video for head like a hole b/c the editing is just so typically 80's. But the best videos are most definately Closer and The Perfect Drug. Happiness in Slavery is just so sick its unbelievable but I guess thats Trent for you. Tape 1 is OK but not anything special the quality of some of the footage is bad but a disclaimer tells you that at the beginning anyway. So all in all its worth getting just for tape 2.Oh and nice packaging also.
3,Neiko 3 Pc. Locking Clamp Set,"This was my first Neiko tool purchase that provided me with some disappointment. The large jaw pair doesn't open nearly as far as the leading brand, and the each of the pairs actions seem to be pretty stiff, but all lock as well as any other brand. When it comes down to these wearing out, I'll replace them with the old standby leading brand which is much better quality."
2,Neiko 3 Piece Locking Welding Clamp Set,These are cheaply made clamps. The first time I used the wide jawed clamp the locking arm bent. I guess these would be good in a throw away situation where you knew they were going to be damaged by the welding operation but I can't recommend them due to the low quality.
2,hatchet job,The House of Cards is brilliant. What a shame some inept editor cut out many of the best parts in this version. For what? Are you in a hurry when you're watching great performances? GIVE US THE WHOLE THING!
2,Could it be any averager?,"What can I say? There is absolutely nothing bad about this CD, and at the same time there is absolutely nothing very good about it either. From the angst-ridden 'Hate', the discordant brass of the title track, the acoustic bleakness of 'Gasoline', to 'Better Than You', this CD is too often bogged down in mediocrity. David Usher's distinct and pleasant voice helps give the band their own identity, but musically, there is very little originality or complexity overall. There are undoubtedly some decent-sounding songs in the lot - 'Leave It Alone', 'Shotgun', 'Baby Skin Tattoo' among them - but ultimately there isn't enough to set the band apart from other bands of its kind. Too often is the band compared to the likes of I Mother Earth and Our Lady Peace, and upon listening to this, I can't help to think that those comparisons are justified. Not a bad CD by any stretch of the imagination, but the band is much more talented than what's demonstrated here."
5,Best tongs I've found so far,"I initially bought these based on the Amazon reviews. Since, my wife has bought other pairs and I've tried various in stores. *Nothing* compares. They bounce-back is perfect, the feel is great, and the ability to hang and lock the tongs in a single motion is awesome.."
2,"""Stainless Steel"" rusts and hard to clean.","Although this item's description says it is made of ""Commercial quality stainless steel"" it arrived with several rust spots; so much for whatever ""Commercial quality stainless steel"" means. Also, be aware that the handles are not round, but are ""u"" shaped. It is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush.On the positive side, the locking mechanism seems to work well and I do like the non stick silicone tips. However, on the whole, I would not recommend these locking tongs."
4,VEGA$$ Season 3 Volume 1,"The Third Season Volume 1 follows the exact same track as the all previous releases with only half a season and virtually no special features. You do get episodic promos and subtitles. Picture quality is clean and audio is clear.The first half of season 3 features the 2-part episode filmed in beautiful Hawaii where Tanna is kidnapped and put under a trance in order to murder Casino magnate Phillip Roth. And Tony Curtis makes a return as the Roth character in 'Deadly Blessings'.This episode also features the Nun that appeared in season 1. Of course this set is a bit pricey for only half a season and no specials, but I am just glad that it is finally released(so many other classic TV show DVD's are stuck at a couple seasons or less and no further releases)."
5,My birds just LOVES these!,"I have no complaints at all!All of my birds love these avi cakes,I recently got them to try them and not one of them didn't like it.So I decided to order them a bunch off this site!They love munchin' out on them."
4,WWE Elimination Chamber 2011 Review,"The Alberto Del Rio-Kofi Kingston match was a pretty good bout even though the IC wasn't on the line. Both Raw & Smackdown Elimination Chamber were both hardcore and hard-hitting showstealers. The WWE Tag Team title match between The team of Santino Marella & Vladimir Kozlov against The Corre's Justin Gabriel & Heath Slater was not great but pretty good. The WWE title match between The Miz & Jerry Lawler was like the movie:Judge Dredd,hardly a classic but still passable. I give this event a 7 out of 10."
2,"The ""Essence"" is missing...","Melissa Manchester is truly a gifted singer, songwriter and song-interpreter (check out her ""Tribute"" album), but, for most of this CD, you'd never really know it. Basically, the songs just don't captivate; they don't stay with you either musically or lyrically. The CD's first three tracks do little to whet the appetite for more. A couple of standoudts include ""Home To Myself,"" and ""Through The Eyes of Grace,"" the latter being a thoughtful examination of a long-since-faltered marriage. Beyond these cuts and a sprinkling of others already found on her original ""Greatest Hits"" outing, there's not much to recommend. Gives you a clue as to why she only had three top-10 hits at Arista."
3,Quite a noisy little beeper,"If take your temp like you're supposed you, you should still be in bed, under the covers after having slept for three hours. However, I get up about an hour before my husband does. This thermometer is quite noisy, beeping every 2-3 seconds and then a final quick 4 four beeps to let you know it's finished. I have to go to the bathroom to check my temp every morning now... currently looking for a much quieter one. Might have to go with the traditional..."
3,3M digital thermometer,Ordered this thermometer thinking it would beep and let me know if my kids had it in the right position when I was taking their temps. However the beeping must only be a feature on the basal thermometers because this thermometer does NOT beep. I could have gone to the local drugstore and got a digital thermometer that does the same thing for cheaper.
4,The first three times I used the BD ...,"The first three times I used the BD Digital Basal Thermometer I also used a standard thermometer to compare the results. The temperatures were almost identical. The BD thermometer gave the readings within 10 seconds, which was a big help. The readout on the BD could've been displayed a bit longer, but it was adequate for my purposes. The item is not bulky and very simple to use."
3,Loud But Efficient,"THE GOOD:This is the only thermometer I have ever used to chart my cycles. It has always been accurate enough that I can clearly see when I have ovulated, so it definitely serves its purpose well. It is also great that it saves your temperature, which is a must have for me, especially since it doesn't light up when I'm done taking my temp, so I wouldn't be able to see it until I get up anyway.THE BAD:This thermometer is loud and annoying. It beeps the entire time you are taking your temperature. Within the first few times using it, I had to tape something over the speaker so that the beeps would at least be slightly muffled, but they are still loud even now. I like to doze while I'm taking my temperature, and I really don't see why all the beeping is necessary. Just one beep when I'm done would be fine. Also, the thermometer lights up before my temp is taken, but it doesn't light up to show me what my current temp is. What is the point of it lighting up at all?"
1,Worked TWICE,"Thermometer worked TWICE on two successive days. From that point the display only registered gibberish. Foolishly, I was very angry and frustrated and since the trash was being picked up that morning, I tossed the thermometer in with the garbage, so I have no recourse (but it felt good to put it where it really belonged). Given reviews of many other digital oral thermometers, I'm downright suspicious of these mass-produced, cheaply-made items (not limited to thermometers, of course - we're overrun with similar junk in this country). I'm going to try a couple of local drugstores to see if I can find a basic, traditional non-digital oral thermometer."
3,Arrived with Battery LOW,This BD Digital Fever Thermometer arrived with LOW battery indicated. I have not yet been able to remove the cover where the button battery is housed.
4,Works good. Annoying beeping though.,"I got this to help aid in the process of trying to conceive. I thought that the feature that alerts you if it's not in the right spot or you open your mouth or something was going to be a good thing to have so that I know I am getting the right temps. But the constant beeping every morning gets old fast. Especially when it wakes up hubby (light sleeper). I found that I can hold my finger over a little hole in the back and it dulls the sound, but they should have just made it do a different sound when something wasn't right. That would be a lot less annoying. Other than that I love that it stores my last temp taken. It comes in handy when I just wake up to take my temp and go back to sleep and forget to write down my temp. I think it's was worth the $10."
4,Best alarm ever,I use to use the regular glass thermometer but i would just fall back to sleep. this one keeps beeping and actually makes you wake up instead of being late. I recomend it
1,Couldn't read termpature on screen,"I was using this thermometer to track my cycle temperature. I had to use it everyday at 5:45am. However, the screen was messed up and I had to tilt it in all different lights to read the temp. Needless to say - that wasn't easy to do at 5:45 in the morning. I threw it away."
3,Not what I ordered and I'm not sure it's accurate,"I ordered the BD brand BBT and got this lavender colored Nexcare BBT model instead. It's back lit which is quite nice in the dark in the morning. I'm not sure it's all that accurate though -- sometimes I'll take my temp again right away to double check and it will be .2 to .3 off. On my old BD brand which wasn't even a BBT, it was usually no more than .1 or .2 off if I redid it immediately. The beeping is pretty quiet and doesn't bother me."
2,Beginner Guide,"A good starter guide for the novice reefer.I found lots of basic information,all care charts were to generalized.Good reading for identification yet lacks Big Time on care of each specific group. Look for the new release in March 2001 for hopefully a more detailed read."
3,Nice but NOT edible???,"I did a search for edible cake decor. These same up. I am new to cake decorating & I had no idea that these are inedible! I was going to use them to stencil peacock feathers onto cheesecakes for my wedding. Now, I had to purchase 5 lbs of fondant, cake rounds & parchment paper to make a removable top for the cakes to decorate. The color is a bit more plum than eggplant. Still good enough to use, but a little too red for my liking."
3,Most of the Thomas videos have repackaged episodes,"Every Thomas video we have has at least one repackaged episode. While annoying for me ad an adult, my three-year old doesn't mind at all. I can't complain too much as the subject matter is better for him than many other shows targetting his age group. Thomas and his friends still teach good values like trust, honesty, and hard work, which really need to be instilled in the younger generations. I'll settle for a few repackaged episodes as long as it keeps my son entertained while teaching him to be a decent person."
1,CD is useless!,"I would guess the artistic quality of this CD would be nothing short of four stars if I could play the CD. I would like to discourage the sleazy tactic of marketing cheap AOL internet software on audio CD's. It has rendered this CD unable to play on some computers. Computers think the disc is software not an audio CD. Other computers think the disc is totally corrupt. Since I listen to my CDs on my computer at work, this CD is basically useless. I'm having to send it back as defective. Is this what ""enhanced CD"" means?"
5,Best album yet!!,"Sarah McLachlan has done it again! This CD has many great songs, and can be listened to over and over! THIS CD IS A MUST BUY!"
2,Still wondering what happened!,"""Surfacing"" had me running back to my ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" cd in no time. I just never expected Sarah McLachlan to follow up FTE's sheer magic with Surfacing's sentimental AOR fodder. I really tried to like this album but most of it was just so boring. The only songs that are above average are ""Angel"", ""Witness"", and ""Full of Grace"". And FOG wasn't even a new song when it was included in the album. The other tracks have good melodies but trite and repetitive lyrics. Surfacing is good if you're looking for plain (and I mean _plain_) background music, but if you're the kind who likes to listen closely this cd may not be substantial enough. Heck, everyone should just get Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. (Ignore the fact that ""towards"" isn't even a word!)"
5,A beautiful singer with the voice of an angel,"No doubt about it, this album is beautiful. I barrowed it from my friends sister and fell in love with it, that I went and got my own. The lyrics are as beautiful as the music, now that's real poetry like Jewel and Tori Amos. Sarah has that nices comforting voice that can sing you right to sleep. From the guitar sonds og ""Building A Mystery"" to the soft and sweet piano sound of ""Angel"" and to the soft percussion sounds of the ballad ""I Love You"" Sarah is one of those rare people who's beautiful inside and out, not to mention her beautiful voice that sounds like an angel sent from above. If you haven't gotten this album or any other Sarah McLachlan CDs, well, HELLO! Get them!"
4,Surfacing-Sarah McLachlan,"This is a great album. I'm glad that I bought this CD because it's really nice and relaxing to listen to. My favorite songs on this are: Sweet Surrender, Building A Mystery, Witness, and Adia. All of the songs are just great because Sarah McLachlan has a really nice voice. I think that everyone should go out and buy this album."
5,Melodic dream!,This CD rivals with Sarah's others for the best visual imagery in songs. I completely adore every song on this CD and highly recommend it to her fans and non-fans alike.
5,The best cd I own,"I dont know what to say besides, BUY THIS NOW!!! This is the greatest cd ever made beginning with Building a Mystery, my favorite. Then, I also love Sweet Surrender, Adia, and Angel. Buy this and also buy Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and the Freedom Sessions. They are all works of art. Lilith Fair forever!!!!!"
5,Sarah's voice will touch the depths of your soul.,"All these reviews are accurate and useful, but if I may add one thing: few songs (much less anything in my life) are so moving as to make me cry, and ""Witness"" does it almost every time. Few albums have the raw, powerful, emotional quality that this album displays. Even the coldest heart cannot resist the penetrating vocals of Sarah McLachlan's Surfacing."
5,stunning! untapped spiritual energy streaming from her heart,"raw emotion that speaks to the heart of everyone seeking answers to the conflict in our souls between good and evil. An admission that we are powerless and desperately seek to know why. A voice that pulls up our own memories of defining moments of victories and defeats, of dreams not yet realized. A tapestery of emotions that allow us to dare to dream again without sabotaging ourselves before we succeed"
4,Bad description,"When the item I purchased said 12 count I imagined that meant twelve separators. Well, I needed 11 pairs, so I placed two orders. Turns out it means 12 PAIRS of separators. Hope that helps someone else!"
1,Good Idea - Poor Quality,"I purchased one to adapt to my stainless smoker. It worked well for about 10 times, then the heating element melted the metal around it, and the mechanizm that advances the 'pucks' jammed, then ran constantly. Unfortunately, its still the best on the market. I would avoid anything like this made in China. It will be less expensive, but poor quality. The stainless BBQs made in China are made from scrap, and the gas regulators are garbage. Buyer Beware"
4,"Uneven, but very high highs","Sebastien Tellier is not a very consistent musician, unfortunately. But with that inconsistency comes the amazing ability to write some great music. Unfortunately, because he loves to jump through stylistic hoops we end up with what sounds like the Best Of What Sebastien Tellier Was Playing With Over The Past Few Weeks. The styles jump around and it can be quite jarring.""Bye Bye"", ""Broadway"", and ""Le Ritournelle"" are both terrific pieces of music that fit well within the scope of labelmates Air. But tracks 8-11 are also quite good and sound closer to, maybe, Daft Punk. Maybe. There are a lot of '80s references there, and some of the compositions are great. But the album is not cogent in the slightest.All in all, this album is worth owning just to have Le Ritournelle."
4,LOOOOONG Book,"This book kept me in prison for a long time. It really bogs down in the middle and then hurries to wrap up. It's a much more ""satifying"" read in the first 1/3 of the book."
5,Doing the right thing,"Great book. The book inspires you to fight for your own causes, no matter how they compare in intensity to Nelson's monsterous battle. A great description of a man that went from a tiny village to being an inspirational leader of the world. A beautiful piece of history!"
3,Good but limited information,"The video has some good basic information on how to mount a scope, use a bore sighter, breaking in a new barrel, and finally sighting the rifle in on the range. The information is basic (assumes the shooter knows little). The video does NOT cover selection of scope, scope mounts, or any other equipment.The video is unnecessarily long and could easily be compressed into 30 minutes. For example, the break-in procedure demonstrated consists of firing one shot, running 20 patches of JB, and two patches of solvent. You repeat this procedure after the first 10 shots. Not only do get to watch Magill run through this procedure once, they included portions of him doing it after each shot.Contrary to the description (which is also on the DVD case), Magill only sights out to 400 yards -- not 800."
5,Absolutely Superb,"Superb and Wonderful beyond words! What more can I say?!Unfortunately, this album seems to be no longer available here on Amazon, but is worth seeking out wherever it can be found. Surely, it is still available somewhere. Seriously consider setting yourself to make an intentional quest for it. If you finally find this treasure, I feel confident in predicting you won't be sorry. (I'm unfamiliar with other of Malovany's albums so don't know whether to recommend some of them.)The beauty and artistry of this extremely gifted tenor singing HEBREW ARIAS (plus the really moving orchestral accompaniment) is an exquisite experience. As I've said: Beyond description!This music is what the adjective ""moving"" is all about. This music and singing is SUPER moving."
4,Very good if a little too long,"Competitive figure skater gay Garry Windsor has fallen on hard times. He bombed at the OLympics, his lover left him and he's performing in a tacky touring ice-skating show called ""Gold on Ice"". The only good thing is his equally gay best friend Jay Logan is in the show with him. On their travels they encounter gorgeous, young and innocent Tag Tempkin who also wants to ice skate like them. But it turns out that Tag is NOT as innocent as them and will do anything to get ahead.Yeah--it's a gay ""All About Eve"" on ice. The characters are interesting, the story moves quickly, the one-liners fly fast and furious and the sex is VERY hot. But there's two big problems with this. Tag is TOO vicious. When he gets mean he gets REAL mean and the fun sort of drains out of this. Also I thought the story was over halfway through but it tacks on one climax too many. Still, all the way through, it's entertaining and fun reading. A little too long but fun. Worth getting."
3,its ok,"Works well after lines are extended, but is to difficult to rewind lines to stored position. Best to just leave lines extended."
4,Great first novel!,"Wow, I just finished this book and man was it great! One thing you might ask yourself is how one child could be accused of something that could have been someone else? I say that while not revealing any spoilers but ask yourself this question when you are well into the book. It is really a disquieting book!"
1,Suffer the Reader,"As a fan of the horror genre, both film & fiction, it isn't often I find myself completely disgusted by a horror story. Bravo, John Saul.This book is both artless & hateful. The descriptions of torture of children, at the hand of another child, are graphic, sadistic, and completly nauseating.The story reads like a frustrated juvenille attempt at horror-porn.Do yourself a favor. Go to Peter Straub, Dean Koontz, Stephen King."
2,Disappointing,Good size but the most primitive pruning.I would have preferred that they hadn't pruned it at all and just left it for me to do. Really bad job for a bonsai.
1,Redwood...or kindling???,"Soooooo upset by this order. Ordered this as a christmas gift for my brother-in-law who LOVES the redwoods. When it arrived, it was deader than dead. It was the saddest looking stump I have ever seen in my life. Charlie Brown's Christmas Tree looks lush and full by comparison. Never have I been so upset by a purchase through Amazon."
2,Not sure about this one!,Tree is totally brown and appears dead...trimmed quite funky. I can only hope it may sprout something in the spring.
3,Ok to watch,"My opinion this Chinese moives lack on lay out of the story when one thing changes to another and looses it's orginal story, this one just in between good story with lots of heroic act"
3,Need a lot of updating,"Creating certificates using the X509V3CerificateGenerator, a key part of Chapter 6, has been deprecated in the Bouncy Castle API. For the moment his example still works in the BC API (1.47)A much more complicated X509v1CertificateBuilder has replaced it. This pretty much breaks a significant piece of the book."
3,Book needs update to J2SE 5.0,"This book does a good introduction but the book needs an update to J2SE 5.x security updates. I like Core Security Patterns by Steel, Nagappan, Lai covers a lot more details on Java security apis than this book."
3,weak but not bad.,"it was suprisingly weak and with short range, but feel sturdy and had a few metal parts."
1,Piece of junk,"Ignore my previous review, this gun was purchased for my younger brother and he had not had a chance to try it out yet.The high capacity magazine does not fit or click into the gun all the way. The only way to fire it is by holding it in upside down. The normal clip will run out in 10 seconds with conservative fire. Sometimes it doesn't fire at all. Sometimes is fires continuously on semi-auto. Sometimes the range drops to under 10 feet. The clips are faulty and the gun is cheaply made. This gun is a worthless waste of money that broke the first time it was used. A spring gun is always a safer investment. Besides, anything this cheap is bound to suck!"
3,Still waiting on my shippment its three weeks over due!,Hotimports need to establish a better delivery system have'nt recieved the guns just yet. But maybe anticipating that these might be some awsome airsoft weapons might help the wait. Hotimports did e-mail me on the problem and said it was some kind of mix up with the delivery company. They should give some kind of incentive for their customers who have these problems with them so they can keep in good standing if it is their fault or not on good customer satisfaction.
2,Low quality airsoft gun,"The quality of this gun is low. The plastic feels cheap. The construction is not solid; it feels like the gun will come apart. The BBs get jammed all the time. I think I spend more time clearing jams than shooting. I wouldn't even say ""you get what you pay for"" because I've bought airsoft guns for this price, which have a far superior quality than this one. The only reason I did not return it was because of the possible cost of shipping this overseas. However, now I'm thinking about it again. I would recommend fellow shoppers NOT to buy this gun."
3,Good fun gun,"I received this a week after i ordered it, not bad. The silencer is fake, not functional but is like an extended barrel. My laser sight came with dead batteries and it broke when i got new ones. My hi-cap mag also did not work. I would wind it forever and ever, then it exploded my BBs all over the place and broke. The gun itself was a great beginners gun but within a month a stubborn bb jammed my gearbox and broke the gun. I did all i could, even taking apart the gun to fix, but it would just not come out. I recommend this gun to beginners as long as you take good care of it, by good care i mean REALLY GOOD care."
1,Don't buy this. The companies send the non time release ones now.,"Before when they sold the time released versions, they were worth it. They worked well for the value.The last set they sent me were not the time released ones. I contacted them, they said it was an error. I asked them if they could send me the time released ones, and they said they don't sell them anymore.They still have the sale posted on Amazon.Do not buy from drugstore.com."
4,Great insight into the insider trading scandals of the 80s.,This is an insightful book that really gets into the culture and environment of the insider trading scandals of the 1980s.
5,"If Drexel Burnham or high yield bonds interest you, this is a must read.","I have always found the the wave leveraged buyouts in the 1980s fascinating. Stewart does an excellent job of illustrating the key players in the high yield debt market during that period, particularly its chief architect Michael Milken and his firm Drexel Burnham."
3,Greed is good and this book too.,"Vivid account about the corporate take-over wave in the 80s and the boom and crash of the junk-bond industry. Sometimes, a bit lenghty, but very absorbing anyway. Only read it if you are really interested, otherwwise I would suggest ""Predator's Ball""."
4,Good overview of Wall Street and the big scandals,Good overview of Wall Street and the big scandals. Gives you an understanding of why they did the things they did
1,Musical Difficulty - 10 / Lyrics & Message - 1,"If you can divorce yourself from the lyrics (and show) that really says nothing... and says it quite crassly, the music is amazing.I believe the composer is extremely talented and could make a competition quality arrangement of ""99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"". Too bad this set of music doesn't say something equally important. Perhaps next time."
