4,Thought provoking feminist revision of Robinson Crusoe,"I found this novel fun to read as well as provocative. The relationships between the woman and the animals (dog, cats, cow, bull calf) that are her only companions are lovingly and nicely drawn. I give it four stars instead of five only because of a two episodes in which I couldn't quite suspend disbelief."
2,No printer driver info.,There is absolutely no information about printer drivers in this book. The explanation about the printing process is so skimpy that you can't tell that it is wrong.
3,Error-filled and being revised,"While a relatively understandable introduction to the topic, it cannot serve as a reliable reference given the number of errors contained in it. Moreover, the author is working on a second edition, due at the end of the year; I can't recommend spending money on the current form.At the time it was written, it was the only thing available and valuable for that alone; but there are better alternatives today. Get the Anthony Mason/Peter Viscarola book instead."
1,Quality going downhill,"I had just ordered the 6.5 quart Amco Stainless Steel bowl so when I saw this back in stock after being unavailable for a number of weeks I ordered it right away.Well this bowl is nothing quality wise like the 6.5 quart I received a few weeks ago. The 6.5 is heavy steel, perfectly machined and finished, no dents, scratches, etc. It has a nice Amco label and the size silk screened on the bottom.This bowl on the other hand seems thinner, is loaded with scratches and dents, the machining on the inside is horrible (it's not even smooth is some places), the metal is pitted, the logo on the bottom is not there, just some SKU sticker. The worst is there seems to be some protective coating sprayed on the bowl.To me it seems Amco has changed suppliers or this bowl is made in a different facility. Both say they are made in India. Maybe I just got a lemon, I'll be watching the reviews here to see if anyone raves about the bowl after my purchase. This one is going back."
4,"Works well, filenaming size issue",Overall this product works well. I noticed other reviews complained about order of pictures being displayed. I shut off the shuffle option and mine did display pictures based on filename order. I prefer the shuffle option though. I have not had the power problem others talked about. One thing that was very frustrating was it would freeze at certain pictures. I finally determined that the picture filename of the succeeding picture was too long. Evidently the picture filenames must be 10 characters or less. Once I changed the filename lengths it worked flawlessly. I only use compactflash cards as that is what I have extra of. I have thousands of pictures on my computer so I setup different folders of pictures and copy those folders to a compactflash card to have the digital frame show different pictures when I get bored with the current set.
4,enjoyed,we really enjoyed this series. It is amazing what people can survive and continue to push thru when elements are against you
4,Alaska...,"This is a National Geography documentary which was released in 1993 but now out in DVD. My interest was the first DVD, BRAVING ALASKA where people live away from civilization and the closest neighbour is some 50 miles away. Good quality and very educational as I expected. Bravo."
1,BEWARE,"This is a VERY OLD series of shows that were done by National Geographic. The shows were broadcast several decades ago, around the mid 1980s, on PBS cable television. I watched them back then and remember them well. I thought from the packaging this was something NEW. Big mistake, so please don't make the same mistake.If I had known the DVDs consisted of OLD (re-packaged) National Geographic stuff I wouldn't have bought it ($15). The company is extremely careful in their advertising & packaging to NEVER mention the creator was National Geographic. The DVD introductions DO make the connection (but that is too late).Don't get hoodwinked by this company, they deceive people by portraying DVDs as something they are NOT. Spend your money on something else. Research all offerings and then call the company to determine if you can get your money back ...before you buy. I expected better from Amazon, but THIS ONE IS A PURE & SIMPLE RIP OFF! It deserves a minus 1,000 rating."
5,My Favorite Socks,"This is my second pair of these socks. They are super comfortable with a good deal of cushion. Originally I purchased for hiking (which they are great for), but I find myself wearing them everyday because they are so comfortable!"
3,nice sock,"The item was delivered on time and in good condition,. this was a birthday gift for someone so I can not make a review on how it feels or is going to last at this time. I will check with the person that I gave it to at a later date to see how they like it and it's general features."
2,"The ""Priest"" let me down.","The overall value of this disc is not very high at all.There are no extras whatsoever. There are no language soundtrack or subtitle options. All you get is dubbed English soundtrack.Despite the claims of a Xenon ""remaster"" the technichal quality here is very low. The print itself is in awful shape, really. The transfer is in fullscreen, yet the sides are compressed making everything look squashed.The story itself is entertaining but only standard fare. The action is somewhat sparse throughout. The acting/direction is grade B and not to be taken too seriously.Unless this film holds some great sentmental value to you I would recommend not spending your money on this dissapointing and careless ""remaster""."
4,Great collection,"After starting to read a borrowed copy, I decide to purchase this. It is a great collection of writers offering varied points of view. Great writers."
4,Ease and Convienience,"This cup holder is easy to install. It is very convienient for people persons who like to have a beverage with them while walking around. They still have both hands to manage the walker. When my friend showed off his cup holder, others asked how they could buy one. Jerry Hill"
2,"good concept, but flimsy","I bought this cup holder for my dad. It fights nicely on his wheelchair, but broke after only a few weeks. He has a tendency to run into doorways and when throwing the wheelchair in the car, it can get easily snapped. I was looking for something simple to use because he only has one good hand and this was at least simple to use. Soda cans fit the best, but coffee cups do not work well. His second one just broke and I am looking for a different model to replace it..."
1,awful,It's awful. I shouldn't have let my friend talk me into watching it. Traci is hideous and waxen.
1,"high voltage work out dvd, must be super android to participate","i love to work out, but not only is this dvd blurry,w/ very bad music...but extremely hard to do.i loved her book, so i got her dvd...you can hardly see her,so dark are the purple and turquoise lights...hated i got it."
2,"Not as good as ""Evidence"" or ""An Autobiography""","I'm glad I was able to check this book out at my local library, because I would have been majorly dispared if I had to pay for this book. Once you go through the book you will notice that it is not as grabbing as either ""Evidence"" or ""An Autoboigraphy. In fact much of the book can be found in the other Avedon book ""An Autiobography."" Overall I found the book to be boring and not up to the par that Richard Avedon is know for. The descriptions in the back of the various people and organizations are interesting but do not warrent the () price tag."
4,Nice & Easy,"I have had this for quite a while now. I really like it. For those of you who may be experiencing problems with it, here is some info. Make sure it is properly strapped tightly in the center (not off to the sides) of your left wrist so it can read correctly and make sure your arm is extended palm up at or slightly over your heart level. The only issue I have noted is that it apparently uses a lot of juice so if it is used every day it will go through batteries rather quickly."
2,Not as good as it seems,Very convenient to use butthe readings are not reproducible;gives higher readings than other machines.high error ratenot sure if reliable
5,BP monitor is great-have used it for years,"This WrisTech monitor is perfect. You must set it up (time & date, etc) before using or it won't work correctly. Follow the directions. It is fast, easy, convenient, has it's own case, and well, a monkey could use it. I have had mine for 7 years and it's still accurate. I tested it versus the one at the doctor's office. The two I bought recently are for family members with heart or BP problems. I got tired of them borrowing mine!"
3,malfunctioning machine,i bought 2 machine and one isnt working. it inflates when on and deflates immediately after without a reading. the other is working todate and is used more than mine. i think i have done about 10 nightly readings to date
1,BPM,"This BP Monitor was not accurate, maybe the wrist style ones are not as good as the arm cuff ones. This is why I had to return this one. Thank You for the refund. I have high BP so I need one that is accurate."
1,This is a fake product..,This is a fake product..I mean to say is it never shows correct readings.I have compared to to 2 different BP monitors. The 2 show the same result but this one always showa wrong results...its either too high or low.The range of error is more than 30%.I recommend not to buy this product.
1,This blood pressure monitor does not monitor blood pressure,"I have to admit it, before I placed the order, I read other people's reviews and I thought those people who said negative things either didn't know how to use a blood pressure monitor or were being nasty to the company who is selling the product. So, I placed the order and here I am, writing another negative review about this product. I am sorry to the seller or the manufacturer, but this is really a defective product. The basic problem is, the blood pressure that it measures is not even close to correct. I have other monitors and I compared the reading from this one with the ones in my doctor's office, and the results from this monitor are always so wrong. I can make this statement under oath that it is true that this thing doesn't work."
4,A Great Find,I love my North American Wristech Blood Pressure Monitor. The reason being it fits right on my wrist. when I have to take my test. I know right where it is. I most always shop at Amazon love the low prices and it doesn't take very long to get your Purchase
2,Don't working good,"I do not recommend this device, it is not accurate for measuring blood pressure. to make several test results are very different!"
1,It didn't work,They say you get what you pay for. Well when you go cheap on something important like this it's just a bad idea. It just didn't work.
4,Nice quality visor,This is a nice quality visor. My only complaint would be that it tends to stink when you sweat in it more than other visors or hats.
4,Shiny happy Trey!,"I have tried to ignore Phish. I am a Pop rock fan by way of Big Star and Badfinger. The endless jams and doodling I didn't like about Phish. However, they have always drawn me in with their studio pop songs. Chalk Dust Torture, Sample In a Jar, Free, The Connection and others I have really enjoyed enough to go out and buy some of the albums that annoy some Phish fans. I like Hoist, Billy Breathes, and Undermind which some of the hard -core hate. Well, if you are that kind of observer of Phish like me, you will LOVE this album! Concise 5 minute pop songs you can't get out of your head. I can't stop playing this CD! I even love the DVD part.Trey seems to be a complex guy, but I really love his simple pop side and its obvious he has a little Big Star in his heart. ""Shine"" alone is worth the price of the CD. Buy it now. All the cuts are strong and memorable."
2,Disappointing Live Show,"As an old KISS fan from NY, I was somewhat disappointed by this DVD which contained only 4 songs. Furthermore, their usual energy and charisma do not come through at all on this recording. I guess they just tried to sell this concert since thy had made a recording of it. It's too bad."
2,Only for the true KISS fanatic...,There are only 4 or 5 songs. These songs are repeated twice. Once with a regular camera angle and another with a very difficult to watch 4 camera composite view. Even the video was poor quality and the sound wasn't that great. The editing also wasn't so great with the extras. Being a HUGE KISS FAN I had to have it. I am glad to have it in my collection. I enjoyed some of the extras like seeing them get the star on the walk of fame and watching them goof around signing autographs. If you're not a KISS FANATIC don't bother....
1,Why can't I ZERO star this thing???,"I would have given this ZERO stars if I could. Like some others, I bought this without reading reviews...never again. This is an unimaginable piece of crud, given the resources that a band with Kiss's marketability *should* be able to produce.I would have gladly taken a full live concert with no touch ups and all the mistakes left in, over this four song embarassment and its worthless filler material...good god, a tribute band?!?!? Come on. Gene probably has 500 hours of private footage of theband through the years. They should be able to release DVD after DVD from each of the band's lineup's. I will question anything they put their name on now before i buy it."
5,Excellent for what it is.,"It is short, brief and the sound is mixed! It is exactly what it needs to be - a capture of a rare event! It is one of those snapshots of KISS that any fan or collector should definitely have. Just remember - it is not a full concert!"
1,Not an official product,"Please take note that this KISS live in Vegas is not an official KISS product, it's not licensed by KISS in any way. So instead of buying this, buy KISS Symphony."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY...,"I've been a KISS fan for over 25 years and own every one of their albums, videos and books. This particular DVD is one of their worst. Consisting of only 4 live songs with the remaining time filled with amateur shot public appearances, this DVD is very slow moving and rather boring. In defense of KISS, this DVD was not approved or endorsed by the band.If you are interested in a great KISS DVD, spend your hard earned money on KISS: The Second Coming. You won't be dissapointed.Dave Casper"
1,ES UNA PORQUERIA!!! UNA DESCEPCION!!!,"Tal parece que el título menciona como si fuera un concierto y nada, sólo ""tocan"" 4 canciones, pero viendolo bien, hacen playback!!!!!!! y se notan ya muuuyy cansados, todo lo demás son grabaciones de vil aficionados, o sea, nada del otro mundo, no tengo nada contra Kiss, de lo contrario me fascina el grupo, pero este DVD de verdad me pesó comprarlo. Como fui a verlos en vivo en el tour del Circus, pensé que era ese show que yo vi, pero nada... mejor ni lo compren... en serio no vale la pena, pagar tanto por 4 mugres canciones."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!,"Only four songs and a bounch of filler. The sound quality of the performance isn't very good. If Simmons and Stanley were smart and wanted to make an easy buck, which I am sure Simmons does, they would get the Last Kiss or some long form concert video out. This was a waste of money."
2,Live in Las Vegas...yeah they are.....a live but that is it!,"Reviewer: Paul from dayton, oh United StatesI am a huge Kiss fan and have been for many years. This was a major disapointment (wanted to check it out here before opening, but my wife did it without knowing). Well my suspicsions were correct. I wondered if it was only a few songs because it was on sale, but at the back bottom of the DVD is says it's 100 minutes...so I figure it's a whole concert. To sum this up...the 4 songs they show are great for a Kiss fan, but this is extremely dissapointing and mostly DECEIVING because I'm sure most people will think it's a full concert. Shame on u Kiss for letting this go thru as deceiving as it it. Give us a real full concert on DVD and prove us wrong that ur just in this for the money :( Ps....after the 4 songs, they show the same 4 songs again...but u see musicians playing at the same time in their own window......um...how gaaay is that."
1,kiss rocks but this dvd sucks,do not buy this kiss dvd. you'll get so badley ripped off. it only has 4 songs and has dumb bonus material. i prefer unplgged or alive iv but don't get this. this is the worst dvd you can get.
3,slight problem,this was an ok dvd there was a slight crack in the centerof the movie and luckily there were only a couple of skips.
5,A Moving Drama,"I discovered the film ""Rain"" because I wanted to enjoy more films starring Faye Dunaway. This film is a moving drama about realizing ones' dreams in the face of adversity. The film based on a story is well acted by all! The cinematograhy is high quality. I highly recommend ""Rain""!"
4,not as good as the book but still good,I got this movie because I had read the books series by V.C. Andrews and I wanted to watch the movie. It was a good movie but they changed a lot from the book. I'm still glad that I bought it but I wish they had stuck more to the storyline of the novel. If you read the book than I think you should watch the movie.
4,reader's delight,"This was the first book i've read from Renee Luke and i'm a fan. This book is a page-turner . The short stories are inviting and keeps your attention it's well written and tasteful, a definite must in erotic ficiton. If your into chocolate and hot steamy sex this is a must read, enjoy!"
1,Be aware of faux liberals!!!,Colmes is an invention by FAUX NEWS!!! He cant even be considered a FAUX liberal because he was invented to be Pawn Hannity's...uh pawn so he can announce that there will be a commercial during their so called liberal/conservative talk show. This book was so mind numbingly..uh..dull and as Faux as Colmes himself..he oughtta banish himself for such buffonry.
1,A Liberal Review,"Alan Colmes tries hard to provide a pithy explanation of the Liberal positions and their inherent correctness.I find that he unconsiously misses the point as he does so many times on air.Since he finds former President Clinton was America's Best President and O.J. Simpson innocent can only confirm his judgments are suspect at best and rise to the level of looney at worst.I feel bad for Mr. Colmes,his intentions seem honorable, but this book really misses the point and focuses on his own perceived level of superior intellect.Having said that,one is recommended to borrow it from the library or an associate before purchasing."
1,"Dull, Boring, Dimwitted","This book is the perfect example for why this time is now being called the post-literature period. Dull opinions given without any insight. Simple minded writing filled with buzz word and sound bite diatribe. He takes no chances, the issues in each chapter are either of low impact or outdated. The chapter on O.J. Simpson is a perfect example of his desire to just fill pages with anything in order to get a book published. Long gone are the days of Upton Sinclair and Thuber. Writers now come in the form of pop stars or even worst Fox news personalities. If Kafka had a frontal lobotomy he would still write a more coherent and insightful book."
1,Every bit as bad as one would imagine,"One of the other reviewers asks 'Why can't hebe ""this good"" on T.V.'? He's bad enough here.Another of the phony Fox News Bufoons who in-terrupts people who come on his show whom hedisagrees with. Take IHR Director Mark Weber.He Wouldn't even let that man talk. And I knowMark; he's one of the most articulate guys outthere. Colmes, who's real name is Goldenberg isa ZioNAZI phony. Let him move to Israel!"
4,Fox News's Porch Liberal,"Sean Hannity is the vilest of the vile. And yet, somehow, Alan Colmes is worse for the simple reason that he obviously knows better. Alan, let me ask you a couple questions: Why do you give that swine legitimacy? You don't debate him. You don't make him answer for his bizarre distortions. Your book made me sad to see you get shouted down by demagogues night after night."
1,Read the Editorial Reviews Before Purchasing,"Please read the Editorial reviews of Amazon and Publishers Weekly before considering this book. They are polite and to the point in their analysis. I, for one, should have followed this advice. The book is boring and self serving; there is no Inspirational Liberalism between the covers, just some more of his confusing opinions and semi-illogical beliefs one hears on his show."
2,Colmes: Self described moderate,"Newt Gingrich is on the back cover of this book giving Colmes accolades! On principle, a true liberal will not be taking this book seriously because of that alone. Self described moderate Colmes writing a book about liberals? Surely, you must be kidding. Hannity hand-picked Colmes (original title of show was ""Hannity and liberal to be named later""); you didn't see Bob Novak hand picking Carville and Begala on Crossfire, did you? Compared to Hannity's vitriol and mudslinging in his book, Colme's book is a total wuss of a challenger to his rightwing counterpart (paralleling the TV ""rivalry"" perfectly). Buy Franken's ""Lies"" book instead; it will stir up the anger, as a book titled ""Left Is Right & Right Is Wrong"" should (but doesn't)."
1,what a title!,"Think about the title of this book:""How Left is Right and Right is Wrong""Is he not saying the left is wrong?He's trying to sound clever but it backfires.He is saying how I am right, and right is wrong.Huh?"
2,The Man With the Worst Job on TV News,"You have to feel sorry for Alan Colmes. He is the ""designated liberal"" on FOX News. His book is the printed form of the way he is presented on TV. He is the,""Liberal that Conservatives can Like Personally although they politely disagree with his views."" He is like many black enertainers were earlier in the forties: the guy greed-heads can point to and say 'Why can't they all be like him?"" He is there for Sean Hannity to verbally step on night after night while Rupert can say, ""See, It's balanced: One conservative, one liberal."" Colmess has chapters about the innocence of OJ and the greatness of Clinton. Give us a break, Fox. Could be replaced on TV with a real straw man. This book exists for the worst ""fake balance and equal time"" reasons.Don't buy it Just go to the book store and move Sean Hannity's book to the ""Fantasy"" section."
1,Falls Short,Repetitive and poorly organized. This is little more than a rant. Dissappopinting. And this review is from a true blue Massachusetts Liberal!
3,Right Wing?,"First I had to buy his book, simply because it was on sale. Also I'm a true liberal and love to see other's perspective about my political views. But also I really enjoy most books, like Al's Lies and Lying Liars. I just didn't get that sense that Colmes really wanted to represent liberals. In the first pages of his book, he plugs books for his co-host Hannity and oddly thanks the conservatives for allowing him to write his book. Honestly I would like to see him write a book, maybe funded by a different publishing company. To me it just seemed like Colmes is being muted or watched by Fox executives.Also the most interesting part of this book is his acknowledgement that the liberal progressive is actually attacking him on his stance. It was interesting for me to see his words and realize that the fact he defends the Fox News Network tells me he is probably under a conservative watch-dog. Too bad, although I did tend to agree with many of his view points."
1,"Boring, boring and boring","I am a loyal liberal obsessed with how the Bush administration is ruining America's image both here and around the world. I bought this book because I knew I'd be able to relate to Colmes's view points and maybe learn something new.All Colmes does is use e-mails from his viewers to prove his point. What is his point? That Republican conservatives are all jerks who send him hateful e-mails. Every once in a while he'll throw in a self-serving e-mail that says something like, ""I'm a Republican and I watched your show and now I'm voting Democratic!""About half way through the book I decided that this was a waste of my time. Colmes tells us what we already know and puts me to sleep doing it. I wanted to like this book so badly, but all I've done is recommended that no one waste their money on this book."
3,Worth the Wait,"I picked this book up out of boredom one day, and quicky went through it. It's follows the general plot outline of your average vampire-type novel. However, what saves it from being irredeemable cheese is Burnell's new take on the genre. I'll admit to a fondness for tacky vampire fiction {Anita Blake anyone?} and I'd become sick and tired of the same plot, same story, same outcome. This was a very welcome change.While the majority of the book is interesting, though not brilliant, it is the ending {and I do mean the end, read it to the last page} that makes this something that I've been trying to hunt down a buy a copy of. If and when you can find it, it's worth the read."
5,Better Than the 60's,"I think I have every Petula Clark ""Greatest Hits collections known to man. (Guilty Pleasure). I truly have to say this is the best of the best. Number One, the fidelity of the re-master is flawless. The selection is wonderful. If you love ""Pet"" like I know most do, do yourself and all you play it for a super service and click the purchase now icon. djpaulegan"
5,canadian crime,daughter has been trying to get this dvd she said to say thanks.its a must have for any eveyln dick fan...
5,Great camera and great pictures,"I have been using the FZ30S for about a month and I am very happy with it's performance and features. I decided on the FZ30S over a digital SLR because of the lens, the feature set and the quality of the pictures. The 19X zoom lens is someting you have to experience to believe. The manual focus is very easy to use and allows me to take shots through a screened porch by setting a low F stop and focus on the subject at a distance. So far everything I have tryed works well and the picture quality is tops."
5,Great Camera - Bridges Gap Between Point-and-Shoot and SLRs,"""Santa"" brought us an FZ30K for Christmas. This was an upgrade from a point-and-shoot 35MM film camera. I checked out many models before deciding on this one. It has an excellent blend of features between the lower-priced point-and-shoot and higher-priced SLR digitals.Photo quality in sunlight and with flash is outstanding. We've had traditional prints made, as well as viewing on computer monitors and high-def TV (in a Christmas ""video"" of still shots that included some close-in pan-and-zoom effects).The picture sharpness far exceeds what our Olympus point-and-shoot 35MM could do. The Leica-branded lens on the Panasonic is great.I won't repeat the other reviews... but I must mention the autostabilizer. It's outstanding. I took a bunch of handheld shots of birds today at full telephoto. No sign of shakiness whatsoever in the photos."
5,Finally!,The next book in the Faiths and Avatar Sourcebook line. This book has been delayed multiply times by TSR and is finally going to come out! It is going to tell of other Dieties Such as Lloth the Spider Queen of the Menobranzan and Shevarash the Drow Slayer of Evermeet. At last players will be able to play demihuman clerics that worship the gods they should be Worshiping! A must have!
4,A wonderful view of the demihuman cults in the Realms,"As in all the Faiths & Avatars line of products, the religious practics and points of view are fully detailed in this book, that adds and enriches role-playing for priests on the Forgotten Realms. The only problem: the goblinoid, giant, and other humanoid priests are not detailed here. This put them below the demihuman priests and deities of this book."
2,The turkey was good anyway,"I thought I'd save a little money by going this route, but I should have just spent a little more and gotten quality tools. The bulb, on the sturdy looking baster, split the second time I went to baste the turkey. I ended up using a long-handled ladel to baste the bird. Given that I no longer have a baster, the cleaning tool is obsolete. I had a terrible time trying to get that twine untied (recommend you don't try to untie the twine after preparing the turkey; clean, dry hands would have helped (sure, it seems obvious now)). The knot was so tight that I had to pick it apart with the poultry lacers. The thermometer and poultry lacers worked fine. I didn't use the brush."
3,St. Peters Banker,the story line was very interesting but it just got so repetitive and frankly boring. Good for those history buffs
5,By far and away the best health book ever,"I give this book 15 stars. I have read over 200 books on health and nutrition--this is the best explanation of causes of poor health--it is the easiest to understand--it is the best guide to future health--tells you exactly how to improve your health--how to fight any and all sickness from lack of energy to cancer--names the exact products you should use and how to use them. This books sums it all up in terms that are detailed but easy to understand. Every person who treats patients in any medical field should use this book as their guide. this book is better, by far, than any doctors office visit or health advice I have ever receieved. don't miss this book--now that I know what is in it, if I had to pay $500 for the book it is worth every cent and more. Raymond Francis is my hero, and I thank him for this information."
3,Expensive,"Without commenting on the author's health claims, prospective readers should be forewarned that the recommended sources of vitamins and products are quite expensive -- hundreds or even a thousand dollar worth of supplements per month from the only source he finds ""pure"" enough, Beyond Health.Not surprisingly, the author seems to be the owner or at least a promoter of this website. That involves him in a serious conflict of interest and undercuts the credibility of his book.An example that doesn't even involve supplements is a trampoline rebounder. Rebounding is praised as an exercise activity, but rebounders are warned that ""inexpensive"" rebounders might cause ""permanent nerve damage."" The solution is to buy a $245 rebounder from Beyond Health.I mean, really."
2,recycled info...plus judgemental,"Some of the info is interesting, however it is so incomplete that you don't have the tools you require to make a proper choice.PLUS he tells you about healing modalities, then complains that they are creepy, again without the info needed to make a decision. I do not believe the author understood the materials he was putting forth."
4,driven by lajon witherspoon's beautifull voice,"lajon is probably the most underrated,rock singers in the world next to the lead singer of living color.his voice is just so soulful and melodic how can you not like him?.songs like dead set,crucified,and damaged shows his strong melodic voice over aggresive guitars,and it works.lajon should inspire other rockers to sing instead of scream cause this brotha can blow,i would be as bold to say i want a solo R&B/rock album from lajon.either way animosity shows a more focused sevendust,compared to their last albums"
4,The definitive Sevendust CD,"This CD is the strongest piece of work Sevendust has ever produced. It is not their most bruising (S/T) nor their heaviest (Home) but it is, in my opinion, their best. This may not be the album for those looking for those fast guitars topped off with screaming vocals (something i love, no doubt, but there's a time and a place!) Though there are some songs that sound like Sevendust of old, this is a soulful, emotional piece of work that plays on the superior vocals of Lajon and crew. One of the best vocalists in music today makes a guest appearance on one of the song's best tracks, as Aaron Lewis guests on Follow. This CD definitely focuses more on writing and singing than past ones, and it is a welcome change. Xmas Day is great, Follow and Live Again are special, and of course I'm partial to the single ""Praise,"" which I can't wait to see in concert so I can go crazy."
5,ONE (...) OF A RELEASE!,"I just bought this album a few hours ago and I must say that it is one (...) of an album! I like how they take a whole different approach to this new material than they did on their self-titled album and their Home album...not to say that their self-titled and Home releases were bad - they were awesome...it's just that it is a lot different on this one. Praise is definitely a major reason to buy this album, and the other tracks kick serious (...) as well! If you are a hardcore metalhead like me, you will buy this album - GUARANTEED!"
4,Another Step Forward,"I've been following Sevendust since the first CD, so it's been interesting hearing the progress they've made up to now. Animosity is much more a step forward than Home was compared to the first CD. Animosity has amazing technical showings, brutal riffs, sing-a-long choruses, and my favorite part - more of Morgan screaming from behind the drum kit. Not a boring CD at all, especially fun to listen to when driving. Take a good listen to Shine if you want to hear a freaking great song. Oh yeah, go see Sevendust, cause the live show will blow every single person out there away."
2,Yawn,"Yawn. Pass the chips. What happened? Who pulled the plug? Where's the kick? Where's the drive? Well, at least I've got one more coaster to put my beer on."
2,BCBG Kiso Pumps,"The color fades, it was actually fading when I received them via mail. Other than the fading they are fine."
3,Lots of parts - short on quality,"Package certainly contained all that you nominally need. However, quality was lacking in the non electrical portion."
5,Slammin Gothic,Savior Machine is honestly one of the most creative and imaganative bands in the Christian culture. There is no other band that displays their originality or style.
5,Adjustable and solid base,"I needed a base to raise by 27 inch monitor a couple of inches off my desk. Using the shortest legs, this is the PERFECT height for me. I took off two thirds of the length of the legs to get my correct height; someone who needed a higher monitor position might want the longer legs.This is quite sturdy; the monitor does not slip.Highly recommended, if you need this little stand."
4,"Nice for smaller monitors, otherwise opt for the wider stand","These are really nice for our 15"" Dell monitors. The wider 20"" - 24"" monitors really need the wider platform for stability and to not look funny.That being said, these are very durable for plastic construction, offer adjustments of the feet, and allow storage space under the monitor, which would otherwise be dead space."
2,mediocre repetition,"Although Steve Roach is my favorite ambient artist, I will also be honest in saying that this release is certainly among his most boring. It doesn't live up to 2003's Mystic Chords and Sacred Spaces by any means. However, being a fan of Steve Roach for 15 years, I've never been let down too much because with as much music as he releases from year to year, he always comes out with something else that gets back to what I like to hear from him."
5,Book review,This is an excellent book. My boss has MS and I could see where they have a lot of the same problems. Great courage!
3,Well...,"The book itself followed no real pattern, Mick was definitely all over the place. As another reviewer had stated, I didn't like how he really kept all focus away from the WWE product itself...and as far as him really calling out Vince, I didn't see it. If Vince was upset over anything ""controversial"" Mick may have said, then he is definitely an oversensitive individual. The book was about as controversial as an episode of The Golden Girls.I do believe Mick does believe the myth that he's more important than he is, though an undoubted legend who had a wonderful career, I believe Mick feels he is on the same plane as Shawn Michaels, The Rock, Steve Austin, Bret Hart, and Hulk Hogan, when that truly is not the case. I'll never knock Mick's work, as I enjoyed it, but he falls just short of that level, at least in my eyes.Still, it's a good read, worth the $14 purchase and I was entertained enough to feel that I got my money's worth."
4,Hardcore Fun !,Bought book for my hubby...he read it in very short order! Only problem...he shares parts of the book with ME all of the time !!!
4,Good Stuff,God product. My coworker stole this from me and used it on her freshly done ink. She claimed the irritation and redness went away the second she applied it. I personally like my bottle of Tattoo Tonic better as far as color enhancement goes but this stuff is great for portability and doesn't smell funky like the tattoo tonic does.
2,Worst Stuff Ever,"I have sensitive skin for starters and have tried many products for my tattoos. I used this on my arm sleeve and it didnt moisturize the skin at all. It made the skin real dry, extremely itchy, red, and was raised. I do not recommend this product at all. Yes it contains no extra additives that over the counter lotions do. My main lotion would be Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizer. Yes it has Petrolatum in it which your not suppose to have but the percentage is only between 5 to 1. Also it is a no fragrance lotion which is standard when it comes to tattoo lotion. Its mostly water and glycerin, which you look for when getting lotion for a fresh tattoo. My tattoos came out bright and brilliant using Aveeno to moisturize the skin. Hardly any peeling, dryness, or being itchy. Stay Away from this product if you have dry sensitive skin. It wont help."
4,Original,I have not used the new one yet as I usually clean my old one (until it rips). Nothing much to say but I am sure it will work just fine and like the original.
4,Can't wait until the next book,"I am enjoying the story of Dayne Matthews and Katy Hart but why spread the story over four books when it could have easily been tied in in one? I have just finished book 2 and it's going to be until the end of October 2006 when book 4 is released. It will be that long before I learn the outcome of the relationship. Oh, I know that true love will truimph and that they will end up together but why must we wait so long. Looking forward to book 3 when hopefully the Baxters will meet thier long lost family member."
3,Forgiven,Inspiring couldn't put the book downMust read in order very helpfulOn top the last book of the seriesIn
3,ZINC,"Faster by Dj Zinc is a little too electric for my taste, however there were a couple of tracks that were very cool. Overall I think most of the tracks would flow well in smooth mix."
2,Terrible...Of Course,"Let's face it...this kind of collection is basically for those who want a big slice of nostalgia for dessert. Birdman and the Galaxy Trio was terrible when it was released and it's terrible now. It's hard not to chuckle, though, when you hear Birdman scream his name every time he takes off to go after the villains. The naivete of the program can be a breath of fresh air from all of the violence on television these days but all in all, I'll take violence along with awareness in the media over censorship anyday. Worth it if you were alive during the Hanna-Barbera era...others won't be amused. A note on the packaging...in a sleazy attempt to save money, Warner Brothers has packaged these DVDs in an inconvenient, cardboard case in which the discs overlap each other. Getting them out and returning them is cumbersome if you happen to be one who doesn't like to get fingerprints and smudges all over their discs. Tsk, tsk, Warner Brothers..."
2,Haynes Repair Manual for Jeep Grand Wagoneer,"If you have a Jeep Grand Wagoneer, you will need to spend the extra money and buy the factory service manual. The Haynes manual is ok for a few small repairs, but I have found that owning a Wagoneer means you either have to be able to do any repairs yourself, or you at least need to thoroughly research what each repair involves before handing your baby over to a mechanic. This is a vehicle with a number of significant ""quirks."""
2,Handles Break Off Easily,"Loved how these cups function but once placed in the dishwasher 2-3 times, the handles easily came off. They seem to just be glued on. Don't recommend."
1,Poorly welded handles,"I am very disappointed to discover that when I gave these as a Christmas gift, we discovered that the quarter cup measure's handle was broken. The handles appear to be spot welded onto the cups and the workmanship is quite poor so the weld didn't hold during transport and packaging. These would not stand up to regular use. Unfortunately I have to pay for return because I bought them too early last year. I will be avoiding Amco products in the future."
1,Received another product than ordered and with missing pieces,"Instead of delivering me the Manfrotto tripod 756MF3 as ordered, I received the 745MFE which is 2 kgs heavier and no longer suitable for the travel that I wanted it for. Moreover, a critical key is missing so that I cannot fix the central column which therefore vibrates. Meaning that the camera is not stable on the tripod, and the tripod therefore useless.A very bad experience!"
3,"NOT a photo essay, per se...","Probably the most important point that I can make about this book is that it is NOT really a photo-packed review of the actual town and fire itself. It focuses primarily on the people of Centralia, and would be a great companion book to have open while you are reading say, ""Fire Underground; The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire"" by David DeKirk.It has a lot of the featured and talked-about people who weave in and out of the story. The photos are poignant and in Black and White, but there are very little photos of the actual town or the mine fire itself."
3,With a Grain of Salt,"As the business world is being inundated with books exalting their management theory as THE one that works, it's nice to see someone offer a method to discrimate genuinely good advice from pedantic meandering. The author brings us back to management basics and offers sound and wise advice. I'm purchasing another one to circulate through my management staff."
3,"Decent Keyboard - D-pad maddening. Right Size, Right Price.","My lovely wife purchased a gyro mouse/keyboard for our media room PC, so I've quit using the Adesso BUT when I was using it, the D-pad was barely tolerable.Before I got the Adesso, I had this Belkin keyboard/cursor control combo that, while trying to pause an episode of ""John From Cincinnati,"" went sailing across my den with much speed until it hit the fireplace and shattered into a storm of plastic squares dancing on our hardwood floor.The Adesso, despite the annoying D-pad, never took flight - and considering how I love to watch keyboards jet through the air, I still have it on a shelf waiting for the day I put a media center PC in the bedroom."
1,Disappointing!,"I ordered this ring and would like to say that I have never seen three diamonds so small in my entire life. I paid $350.00 for the ring, but even the box that szul.com shipped it in says it is only worth $99.99. The picture is misleading, so be warned that this ring is VERY TINY! My advice to all is keep looking and save yourself time because this ring isn't a bargain at all. I am returning this ring immediately because the ring is not worth the money."
1,Don't buy it if you don't want to be ripped off.,Think twice before you buy this DVD. It shows only the drill team performing at their Barrack area for those regular tourists. Nothing spectacular. Just like they are practicing or what. The video and audio quality are worse than an old video tape. The DVD contains quite a lot of advertisements to sustain the 45 minutes claimed duration. I feel nothing but being ripped off.
5,My review of A Song for the Asking,"It is rare to find a book better written than A Song for the Asking. The author does a masterful job of developing his characters and bringing them to life for us. I love finding a book that is a joy to read just for the sake of reading. This one is. I can't wait to start Kane, Steve Gannon's second novel."
5,An exceptional novel,"A Song For The Asking is a simply outstanding book, and one of the most captivating novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Steve Gannon is a truly under-recognized author, and I am excited for his next works. He does a phenomenal job of expressing the inner thoughts of each character, and is a true literally genius. Once I began reading his book, I didn't put it down until it was finished. Highly recommended."
2,NOT pocket sized.,"This is not a pocket dictionary. A pocket dictionary should fit in your pocket. This is a conveniently sized dictionary for a backpack or a large purse, but by no means a pocket."
2,Keep looking,I purchased this dictionary for a two week backpacking vacation. It was big and complex. The guy I was traveling with had a good dictionary. After carrying both of these for a couple of days we tossed this one in the the bottom of our bag and never opened it again.
3,Pocket Dictionary?,"This is a good book for translation, however I bought it for travel. The description is misleading so you better hava a very large pocket."
2,Laced,Very disappointing. Ms. Clark's style of writing is immature and would make a great read for middle schoolers!Definitely not in the same league as authors Alice Sebold or Sue Monck Kidd.Don't waste your time or money - unless you read at a grade school level.
5,Dump in a minute,I've had a Load Handler for over 21 years. As long as nothing gets caught behind the wheel well It will move as much material as you can load in a full size pickup even jack hammered concrete stacked to the top of the bed rails. I built sides that hit over the wheel wells to keep debris from getting caught and allow me to stack higher. I've had the standard models which lasted for years under constant abuse. This time I bought the Commercial Grade and for all the weight I haul it is worth it. It cranks much easier and dumps fast without a lot of back strain. Love going to the dump and pulling up next to the gardeners or professional re-modelers and unloading and leaving while they are still tossing stuff off there trucks.
1,Poor presentation of Ezekiel,"The author has no earned Ph.D. from a reputable university only a Th.D. from Dallas Seminary. The presentation can't be worth much as indicated by the price of the book indicating it's lack of demand. Secondly, published by southern baptists shows something must be wrong with Enn's dispensationalism."
4,Physical Flashback,"After exercising with Gilad for years when he was on another network, I am SO pleased to be able to lace up the sneakers again. This video is a good way for me to get reintroduced to regular exercise."
5,Our bun loves this!,He loves to dig and chew at the mat. It really gives him something to play with in his cage that I feel comfortable letting him eat.
3,easily eaten,My bunny is a large rabbit and ate this in a matter of days. Better for smaller rabbit. I ended up having to collect the remainder of this and compost it.
5,atomic77,GOT THE WOVEN GRASS MAT FOR MY RABBIT TO PULL AND TEAR UP AS WELL TO EAT -- THIS KEEPS HERE ENTERTAINED
2,VACUUM ACCESSORIES,"ALTHOUGH YOU ARE NOT TOLD, MOST OF THE MILWAUKEE VACUUM ATTACHMENTS WILL NOT FIT A TWO PIECE WAND. YOU WILL GET NO REPLY TO EMAIL AND NO SATISFACTION ON THE TELEPHONE. BUY IT AND LOVE IT."
3,Lie,This gun does not shoot at 400 FPS. Not to mention it says that its shoots 400 FPS with .12 and then 325 FPS with .20 on the box. Although it is very fun to shoot the product description is very decieving.
2,Very small,"Although my rabbit is too big, it is made out of fine-tasting hay. I bought this a long time ago. Most rabbits (mine) would hate this. I would recommend the grass mat because mr.bunny loves it! No normal rabbit would fit in this thing."
3,But what about the buckle?,But aren't you all forgetting the most important thing? Does this product or does it not do a quality job of fastening a leather strap that could effectively hold up my pants?
5,ORIGINAL COPY,"Ha Ha. Yes... I have one of the original LP""s. It's still V-E-R-Y FUNNY!!! In my previous lifetime I found many ""trueisms"" in this recording."
3,Good but not great,"I have been searching for a cookbook similar to this for some time. While many cookbooks offer a section on appetizers, or ""snacks"" as it were, they're generally limited to a small percentage of the book or too ""foo foo"" for my tastes. While there are quite a number of recipes in this book that don't whet my appetite or that I find downright gross, there are also a fair number that are interesting and/or inspirational. They also really run the gamut from rather effortless preparation to ""do I really like these people enough to expend all this energy?"" Rather than serving the same old, same old, it's nice to have a cookbook to look at for something a little different."
2,Major Mystery Transformed into Movie Disappointment,"I have read each and every Tony Hillerman mystery and thoroughly enjoyed each one. Likewise, I eagerly awaited this DVD, A Thief of Time. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything very good about it. Unlike the many (read British) PBS series that have dramatized great detective novels into entertaining movies, this installment in the initial ""American Mystery"" series is a hopeless dud.Tony Hillerman writes a rich, vivid novel in the nuance of the Navajo culture. His details and characters are too much for a 93 minute DVD to digest. Scenes flit around in small one and three minute sequences, disjointed and disorganized. Hillerman's plot device of having parallel plot lines join at the end create too many complexities for a rushed presentation.I deeply regret the disservice to a wonderful author and mystery novel, and frankly wish I could say something more positive. Well....let's try...the Four Corners scenery is beautiful."
5,Good adaption of Hillerman work...,"This is a good video and worth seeing, especially if you've read some of the author's wonderful Southwestern-themed books. Part of a great PBS American Mystery Series - nice production although I think it's very helpful to read the books first, which have a bit more helpful background story as well as detail about the interesting Native American culture and traditions."
2,Thief of time,Really terrible acting not worth the cost of the videosad really because the cultral scenes could show more of the story
5,A Thief of Time,A Thief of Time captures the 'lore and mystery' of the Navajo people and compliments the Tony Hillerman novel perfectly.
2,A Thief of MY time!,"Let me say first that I have read and love all of Hillerman's books and ""A Thief of Time"" is perhaps his best. I expect movies made from books to take some license with the story but....This is not even recognizable!! The characters are not anything like Hillerman's characters whom we have all learned to love and the story could not even be followed if you hadn't read Hillerman's version to fill in the blanks, and there were lots of them! I know these actors can all do much better so I don't blame it on them. It's kind of like they took the best parts of the book and said ""Let's see how BAD we can make this"" and then took the other parts and said ""Let's just leave that out""!!"
5,Why you need to read this book,"This amazing work (comprising three intertwined books of approx 160 words each)is a must have for any person looking to explore the way of Tao.*It is entertaining and a great read with much reader attachement to the unfolding story.**It is FULL of Taoist lessons on theory, practice and history.I would also reccomend other works by Deng Ming Dao without reservation.Enjoy your reading."
1,Sheer Fantasy,"I bought this book hoping to better understand Taoism and read about a real-life Taoist master. I had high hopes due to all the glowing reviews on this site. However, when I started reading, I quite quickly realized that this was not biography. It is a historical fantasy novel, with flying women warriors and everything. It makes very little pretense at being historical or based on fact, though the main character is apparently named after a real person. Now there's nothing wrong with that genre, and people seem to enjoy it. But it's not what I expected. And as to whether it somehow overcomes its lack of factual truth to reveal deep spiritual truth, well, I certainly hope the portrayal of Taoism as a cult of magic and longevity is inaccurate. It is certainly not worthy of the Taoism I know through reading the Tao Te Ching.So, if you want a historical fantasy novel set in China, you might like this. But if you are interested in Taoism or truth, look elsewhere."
1,Waste of four and half hours,"What's with these anthromorphic beings? What we need are not cat people but dog people. That is what was wrong with planet Pellicia, they needed dog people to help fight there way out.As I was reading the novel I always thought it was going to get better, but it just slowed down. It was as if the cast of Cats were captured and placed on the set of Battlefield Earth.The ways in which Simba described the characters was disturbing; I could care less for the detailed descriptions. The story needed more developement.There were good visual effects on the cover and on the back cover.In all the book was excruciatingly long and borring."
5,Logic3 Travel Kit for iPods,LOVE IT! Now everyone in the house wants one. I love not having to search for everything. The stretch pockets are a great help.
1,Horrible! Sharpens unevenly,"I have ruined so many pencils with this pencil sharpener. No matter what type I buy, it sharpens them on one side of the pencil and often leaves the other side still encased in the wood. We have a 20 year old Panasonic at work and I wind up taking the pencils to work to sharpen them and then bring them back home. Now, I getting a Panasonic. I hope it works better than this one."
1,Wasted money...poor Quality Control,Never worked correctly...got so frustrated I threw it on the ground and broke it. Don't buy it.
1,Stay Away,"This item only worked for a couple of weeks before it completely gave out. I sent it back to the warrantor. In a few weeks I got it or a replacement back. It worked for another couple of weeks, but now it doesn't shut off unless it is unplugged. I already spent around $10 sending it for repair as it is a big item so this time I will just junk it and accept the loss."
1,BAD pencil sharpener,"I am an artist, I do a lot of pencil drawing, so I wanted to get a high quality pencil sharpener. This one costs $30, so I thought I would be getting a good product. It isn't. Do not waste your money and time. It does not do anything it claims. It's supposed to bring the pencil to a perfect point with it's ""hands-free"" system. You're supposed to be able to put the pencil in and it will hold it automatically and sharpen it, then turn off when it's sharp. What it actually does is whirr, and look like it's doing something, but it never brings the pencil to a point, and never turns off automatically. To be fair, it does sharpen the pencils somewhat, but so do those little plastic sharpeners you can buy for 25 cents. For $30, though, I was, to say the least, disappointed. The only reason it got one star was because I couldn't give it zero. Boo on this product; Boooooo!"
3,Great Little Sharpener!,I have this pencil sharpener on the craft table in my house. I love it because my young daughter can sharpen her pencils and colored pencils by herself. When the pencil is sharpened it turns the sharpener off which is a great feature. It is lightweight and not real loud. The only down fall of this product is it is a little messy to clean out the shavings.
3,Don't expect much...,"I ordered 6 pairs of these gloves for the price of $8.00 each for my students. I didn't go in expecting much and for that I'm glad. They are made out of PU material and nice dense foam. The gloves look exactly like the pictures, and as you can clearly see are ugly as sin. I've personally used them and I will say that the gloves are nice and snug and the padding and weight are perfect for bag and pad work. I wouldn't recommend this glove to guys who are looking for something that will last years but if you need to fill your school up with loaner gloves or cheap competition gloves, I would use them."
1,Save your money. Buy Lava soap instead.,This stuff works to some extent. You will have much better/faster results using Lava soap and save money too. Poison ivy is an oil/resin that sticks to your skin. Nothing works better than Lava soap at removing the oil/resin of poison ivy from your skin so it can heal. Ask any oil-rig worker or mechanic what soap he or she uses to clean-up and they will all say Lava. Lava has significant percentage of pumice built into the soap that few soaps can match. The pumice is super-effective at scrubbing out the oil/resin.
4,Dank A$$ Jungle,This cd is an awesome cd to add to any collection for drum n bass heads. Most of the tracks on here are dark and heavy. With mass rolling basslines. Can't punish me is a killer track from Dom and Roland. Technical itch does an alright job mixing. MOs def a good buy!!
1,"Nothing like the original ""Jools'.","I bought this CD because I thought it was the same as the original ""Jools"" from the 60's. I love Julie Driscoll, and know every lyric from the original. This is a dreadful copy. The back up singers are horrid, the music lags like it's slow-motion, and it deadens Driscoll's vibrant voice. TOTAL RIP-OFF!"
3,It works sometimes.,I am using it to charge my iPhone directly from a desktop at work. When I try to plug it in my car USB it does not work. I have tried it on multiple cars. Take it for what it is worth.
4,very nice for such a low cost,"I knew this was going to be a cheaper quality item, but the pricing was great! You can buy the same item in stores for five times the price. In the end I say these are a good item and worth buying a couple of so you have spares! Also as a side note, aside from the stickers not being perfectly aligned, the quality was better than I anticipated..."
1,did not work,this did not work on my ipod not my wifes older model. Be careful of purchasing this for your ipod. I dont recommend.
4,Great product,"The cable is convenient and easy to store. I have only used it a few times and connecting was a little difficult (tight). Probably just me getting use to it. Convenient to carry. I ordered two, one in my carrying case and the other at home. I would definitely recommend."
1,"Shoddy construction quality, stopped working after 3 months","You get what you pay for, I suppose. I bought this to use with my iPhone 3GS along with a USB car charger. The retraction spring mechanism failed after 3 months or so. It also stopped functioning as a charger around the same time. It still can sync, but without the charging ability it is basically useless to me. Do not buy this brand."
2,Not good,"Not too good. See my pics, I think they explain everything. In the end, you get what you pay for, and this is no exception."
3,It's fine for 2 dollars,"I purchased it because it is the cheapest connector on Amazon. Well...it really does its job. However, even though I ordered a ""new"" one, this one looks really dirty and seems like a used one. Given that it cost me 2 dollars, I will say it's ok. So far, no problem using it."
1,Piece of junk,"What a piece of junk. It worked well the first two nights, connecting my iPhone 3GS to my car stereo and charging the iPhone at the same time. Then the iPhone started telling me ""charging is not supported with this device."" The next night the car stereo stopped reading the iPhone altogether. I switched it out for a standard cable and everything works fine again. I guess I'm only out 2 bucks, but I could have better spent those two bucks on a cup of coffee or few pieces of Laffy Taffy. At least with Laffy Taffy the laughs are intended."
1,iphone charger cable,doesn't work at all.. it's cheap.. but charged the iphone for the whole night.. doesn't charge at all!!!
3,ok,It was obviously very cheap and the quality is reflected. It does charge the phone but does so very slowly.
2,Not what I expected,"I was extremely unhappy with this cable. It says it is about 3 feet long, which is what I was expecting...not at all. I was looking for a cable longer than the one given with my iphone, it is approximately half the size. I would not recommend purchaseing this pruduct.I do like that it is retractable, but I don't see the purpose of the retractable cable if it is too short for the cord to even reach the table. I realize this product was cheap, but I feel as though I did not even get what I payed for. It was a complete waste of money!"
4,USB Charger Cable,Love this product for iPhone 4 even with an Otterbox works great. Will not work with iPhone 3 with an Otterbox! Works great for people that travel!
2,Not as pictured,"This item is not as pictured (purchased from SFPlanet). I ordered it because it showed the newer style dock connector which will work with cases but received a part with the older style connector. This is the second cable of this type that I've purchased which was not as advertised and it makes me mad because I'd pay more to return it than it's worth but meanwhile I'm stuck with two useless cables. So I'm saving you the hassle, don't order this product if you're looking for something like the picture which can be used with iphone cases. I see that the new seller (eTech) has a more representative picture up, but just be warned that you may not get exactly what you see pictured if you buy this product."
4,Surprisingly Well Made,"Being that this product was a mere $.33 when I bought it, I wasn't expecting much. The reviews said mostly positive things about it, but there are times when I speculate the validity of others ill advised opinions. That being said, this product broke my expectations.The retract feature works much better than I ever thought it would. I have had retractable ethernet cables before that were very cheaply made, resulting in a broken cable and increased latency. This product, on the other hand, is very simply made but with quality components. The retract feature works seemingly flawless.In addition, I had no problems charging or using data transfer. It connected and transferred flawlessly.The only thing that bothered me was the high shipping cost. I purchased 3 to have on hand at work/home/laptop bag and paid ~$1 for the product, but a wopping $9 for shipping. Nearly 10x the cost of the product for shipping? That just seems unreasonable."
2,Tim and Harvey in the Great Outdoors,"Not as funny as I thought it would be. Just Tim and Harvey being stupid. Sound was not good--got loud, then quiet, then loud."
3,Just this side of Normal,I was just a little disappointed with this book. I expected tosee more about how it affected the entire family (the brother Ben andthe Father who just disappeared from the rest of the book).
5,Chad I LOVE YOU!!!,ok first of all this is better then ever!! anyone who has nevver heard of 2gether get this single!! it will make you an automatic fan for life. it has that pop sound that makes you wanna play it over and over and over well you get my point. i already bought my copy why don't you and also one more thing CHAD I LOVE YOU!!!
3,Very Basic,Its a very basic overview of Ayurveda which is exactly what it claimed to be. It seems that knowing your own dosha before hand would have been a good idea.
1,"what this seller ""FORGOT"" to tell you!","Like all MDT drives, this one is also REFURBISHED (and there's a good reason why refurbished equipment costs considerably less than brand new...just like there are good reasons why consumers should buy from honest vendors who, unlike this one, tell the WHOLE truth!).In short, STAY AWAY! This sellers & his products are BAD NEWS!!!"
4,"Small, Simple, but Worthy","This book journeys back into biblical times, where the reader may learn about ancient customs, jobs, food, and furnishings of the Old and New Testaments. Now in its third edition, Concordia Publishing House first published this book in 1947 as part of the Concordia Leadership Training Series. Later, in 1959, Dr. Klinck revised the first edition (therefore, the 2nd edition). Now in this 3rd edition, Dr. Kiehl has revised the text, bringing it up to date.Each chapter of the text list dozens of specific Bible references, which will aid any reader from pastor to layperson. Also included in this little gem are simple line drawings and illustrations that show commonly used equipment, materials, structures, and raw goods. Last, the text includes review questions and exercises at the end of each chapter, which may or may not be used to increase biblical knowledge and strengthen the chapters' lessons."
4,Good item but duplicate Math CD (if you have Reader Rabbit Preschool),I bought this item (and looked for it specifically since I had the Reader Rabbit Preschool Variety Pak) and I am a little disappointed. I did not realize the Math CD was a duplicate of the Preschool Variety Pak... I know I should have read better but I was more interested to finding another awesome program for my 5 year to use. We have had Reader Rabbit Preschool Variety Pak for the last 1 1/2 and he loves it. I thought it was time to step up one and looked for another Reader Rabbit for the next age group. The other 2 disks are quite different and are worth it but I probably would have just purchased the Reading/phonics disk by itself and been just as happy.. Oh well.. overall I like the Reader Rabbit series and my little one loves learning with the characters
1,"False, misleading and dangerously unscriptural","The author repeatedly takes scripture passages out of context and/or twists them wildly to fit her bizarre belief system, and uses random anecdotes to manipulate the uncritical reader. She seems to teach a new kind of wierd religious feminism, while at the same time propogating doctrines to control people through fear and condemnation (spiritual abuse). READ IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
3,no dark goddess,"there were no dark goddesses in this deck. i was sad to see queen gwenyfar in the deck but not morgan le fay. where are Kali, Morrighan, Hecate, Pele and the like. the tarot is about a journey and lessons learned along the way."
3,ok,I bought for my Pre-K class and its ok some stories the kids like but most dont hold their attention.
4,"Good info, easy to understand","I ordered this to go along with a class on molecular systematics and evolution. So far it has been great. I haven't had a genetics class in a while, but I'm having no trouble following the reading. I'd definately recommend this book to anyone else new to the field of who is looking for a good desk reference."
3,not the best quality,"After installing these for the first time the caps on the front of the lug nuts came off, its just a little plastic piece but you would think they'd hold up better. Also it was very nerve-wracking tightening these, they kept feeling like they were about to strip and I only torqued to 100 ft/lbs. Still worth buying for the fact that all the locks are different."
4,Primer for You Creativity,"I thought the trading examples and strategies were creative and well explained. It might not be completely appropriate to take these ""trading systems"" and use them as-is directly in your trading, but they certainly are a good primer to get you thinking of creative ways to find and exploit market inefficiecies and tendencies. The stock market is not completely random, which is why I think these ""panic"" and other stategies have merit. You've got to think up you're own trading stategies to fit your personality and strengths and I think this book is a good start towards that objective. I've used my own adaptation of the QQQQ crash system and it has worked well. The only thing I wished the book covered more was maybe a short rebuttal chapter to those who would suggest that this is all data mining, which I don't believe it is.This is a unique book and one that is worth reading."
1,Remedial,"Big print, lots of charts and illustrations. Lots of hype, weak content. I was 50% through and couldn't take it anymore. I returned the book for a refund."
2,Careful!,I backtested most of the strategies listed in this book going back over a much longer period than the author used and found that most of them either lost money or made tiny profits.
2,no original thoughts,Much too simplistic- no new thoughts there. Very short daily blurbs that really have no new insights. Needed to be more thoughtful.
4,Hugable toy for grandson,"I bought this for my 21 month old grandson who loves monkeys. It's almost the same size as he is, but he drags it around with him everywhere and sleeps with it."
2,My 16 month old broke it in 1 day!,"I bought this table for my 16 month old daughter. She has another table like it that she absolutely LOVES, so I thought this one would be great, too. It held her attention for about an hour before she cam running to me with the block part in pieces. She had broken it.. and now, even with it repaired, won't touch it anymore."
3,neuropsychology of weight control,"This contained good information, but I have found Eat to Live much more helpful in my quest for weight control."
3,Music is distracting,"The female singers in this presentation sound like a militant Bananarama, invading your ears periodically throughout. It was distracting, but I actually liked this version of Elizabeth, this time around it is centered more upon the relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. Acting was quite good. If you like to collect movies of Elizabeth I, this will be good for your collection"
3,Nor for the time traveler,"I know it has a lot of drama and all. But this is not a film for viewers who don't want to hear a Queen Mary with a strong New York accent, see a bunch of people playing Elizabethan roles with decidedly modern movements and speech patterns, and hear rock-y modern music in the background."
5,Great Text for Teaching Incident Command,"Hank & Paul have taken a very complex topic and transformed it into an understandable format. The text is a much needed addition to EMS research & literature replete with teaching tips, ready to reproduce ICS forms and real world insight to make the tough job of managing these incidents easier and effective. Bravo guys GREAT BOOK!"
5,"Ask yourself ""Do I really need to spend money....""","Ask yourself ""Do I really need to spend money on a system to automate a task when it works already to a satisfactory level?"". It may be that buying and installing the equipment to automate the task causes more problems than it solves. We don't need to buy equipment to perform a task that works already, especially if the consequences can include apparently random problems that we don't have knowledge of, or aren't trained for. If you've never thought of these questions (and loads more besides) then read this book. You might find answers and you'll be glad you did."
3,Math Missions,"Eh, This software is okay.Positives- students really like it.Negatives- Too much talking and trying to sound cool all the time. You can skip through it but...annoying.I would like to see more structure in the way the curriculum is presented and delivered but it is not bad. Anyway I was hoping this software would be as good as Calculating Crew but IMO it is not."
4,Yummy Hawaiian Classics,"Forget you ever heard of the Hawaiian Lounge singers from the '50's and '60's... George Kahumoku, Jr, gives these terrific songs new life. If you love slack key, this album is a lot of fun. I have never been fond of ""Tiny Bubbles"", at least not until now. ""Pearly Shells"" is a sweet, compelling love song in GK's hands. This is 50 minutes of delight."
2,"If you don't know about IP and ARP, why are you doing NAT?","I picked up the book hoping to learn stuff about NAT that I didn't already know. Unfortunately, I found that I was reading a lot about basic concepts that anyone who is going to use NAT should already know. Sections about the IP protocol and TCP headers! At one point, the author says ARP is part of the invisible data link operations. Who is going to use NAT and not know about ARP??? Most of the book is about 5 main points about NAT rehashed over and over again. NAT is pretty simple; if Kernighan & Ritchie could get away with a book a quarter of the size of the NAT book, Dutcher (the auther of NAT Handbook) must have gotten paid by the page."
2,Save a tree...don't make another book like this,"This book is way vague. No specific examples, mainly lengthy hot air explinations of the theory of NAT. For (price) bucks, I would rather have bought a Cisco specific handbook. If you do NAT at work and need a few pointers and pratical solutions, this book is not for you.If it was on Survivor, it would have been voted off the first day."
1,not compressed air,I think it is misleading for Amazon to categorize this under compressed and canned air as it is neither but rather a product more similar to pledge and its used to wipe down your surfaces rather than clean your electronics. Be warned
5,Starlight Starbright,What a delightful book. It will simply take you back to your childhood.........especially if you grew up in a small town because this is about life in a small town. Excellent characters that will probably remind you of someone you knew in your hometown! I can't wait for the sequel.
4,A not so modest proposal,"Buckley is quite aware of Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" - he even has his protagonist, Cassandra Devine, reference it. Boomsday is a traditional satire, quite even-handed in poking fun at everybody: politicians, voters, senior citizens, young people, religiosity, even the Russian Mafia. His characters are broadly drawn and a bit cardboardy, but that is a requirement of the genre. If you liked ""Thank You For Smoking"", you'll love ""Boomsday""."
3,Trying too hard?,"I was disappointed in this book and actually didn't finish it. I had read Supreme Courtship and enjoyed it a lot. This book, however, seemed, as another reviewer mentioned, silly rather than satirical. In the beginning, I was intrigued by the main characters, but they quickly became cartoonish and I lost interest. For example, it seemed completely out of character that a woman who feels so intensely about her causes that she will go to jail for them would work a day job that required using outrageous spin to keep reprehensible clients out of the courts. Buckley can be funny and clever, but this book just seemed ham-handed. I may try another one of his books sometime, but not until the memory of this one has faded."
3,"Great for anyone else, but average for the Great Christopher","The White House Mess and Thank You for Smoking were so great that it would be hard to have to follow those up. I will read anything he puts out, but I found that I just didn't care for this as much. No big laughs, and the characters weren't as well fleshed out. He is still better than most, but read Mess and Thank You and you will thank me."
3,Painfully close-to-reality satire,"Christopher Buckley's humor is so close to real that it's sometimes hard to laugh -- but then, you do anyway. For anyone who follows politics -- and especially anyone who is still idealistic in the face of the creeping virus of unavoidable cynicism -- Buckley speaks for you. I find I want to compare him to Hiaasen, but it's an unjust comparison. Carl Hiaasen is comical and outrageous in his plot-lines and characterizations. When I read Hiaasen I feel like I do when I read Harry Potter. It's unreal in its bigness and broadness. Buckley is not like that. He is just a bit-beyond-the-completely-typical, which makes his work hysterically funny. Plus, it also flatters readers by intimating that they are ""in on"" something -- privy to a secret truth; the truth of how close he gets to reality without just writing current events or parody. Much like a very smart inside joke that you hoard for its delight and for the status if confers on you, if you get it."
1,"Tiresome, Unfunny, Typical","I have never found this writer other than labored and tiresome in his attempts at topical humor. This is probably the most strained attempt yet. As someone else has pointed out, Buckley strives to emulate Tom Wolfe but cannot manage the social minutiae. Everything he says seems to be regurgitated, and his characters are just silly names (Cassandra Devine) with no roots or nuance. This does not read like satire, but like a shallow parody of popular TV drama, the sort of popcult parody that might be conceived by an inebriated and aging closeted bunburyist, perhaps the type who is always overeager to remind people he has a wife, two children, and a dog named duck."
5,My little one LOVES this !,My brother bought this for his kids and bought it for me (10 years later). It has not changed much but it is so much fun. My little one started playing with it when he was about 3 1/2 and at 5 he is still playing the games and learning something new.... I would recommend this as a staple for kids learning software!
1,What happened?,"Almost Here was fantastic. It was one of my favorite indie-rock albums of recent years. It was lyrically clever and catchy. I'm not sure what happened to this album. Its not that it got more poppy sounding or too overproduced or anything. Its not even that they took another musical direction and it went awry. It just got worse. As if the band completely ran out of material to work with. Rather than being catchy the music is just annoying and lacking. Rather than being clever the lyrics are dumb. So this album just left me in a bad mood thinking, ""What happened to a band that had the potential to be so much better?"""
2,Downward Slide,"When Brian Eno produced James&#65533; Laid in 1993, he released a jam band&#65533;s tendencies from a tightly knit pop group. Every release since then has been a step back towards pro-forma songwriting, with uneven results (Whiplash, especially, seemed uninspired &#65533; it lost them their US label). Pleased to Meet You, again produced by Eno, doesn&#65533;t reverse the band&#65533;s downward slide. Still, there are moments. &#65533;Space&#65533; opens the CD with atmospheric promise, followed by &#65533;Falling Down&#65533;, a jaunty erotic jag. After that, it&#65533;s ten songs until we get to &#65533;Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)&#65533;, a chiming first single."
2,Double D avenger,"Product contained a lot of fully dressed UGLY women. Should be rated no higher than PG 13, and that for the one (out of focus)boob shot. Service was excellent, product was a waste of time and money."
1,"If you liked ""Citizen Kane""...","While I'm not entirely sure, ""Double-D Avenger"" has all the signs ofof being an unofficial ""Citizen Kane"" sequel. Just switch out Rosebud for oldstrippers and it's almost the same movie.Okay, seriously, a staggering piece of crap and not in the good, fun staggeringpiece of crap way.Not worth the rental."
3,"Pretty good, though missing some stuff.","Not a bad collection of America at war, though some things are missing like the Spanish and American War. World War II could've been better explained, but the Vietnam, Iraqi Freedom, Desert Storm, and Revolutionary War DVDs were quite impressive! I would recommend buying this collection just for those alone!"
3,It could have been better,"I tried to read the MTG books in the order they were published, and after reading Arena, I was very surprised by the difference. Also, you can't expect all the books to be the same. I think the book was good -- the plot was almost too predictable and the main characters are developped nicely. The name of the characters is another matter: they are way too ""green"" related. I used it with my students, and they seemed to have liked it more than I did."
4,"Good, but Early Work by Noted Greek Theologian","The author has made a name for himself in church circles even outside of Orthodoxy for his enlightening take on the centrality of the Eucharist in ecclesiology. I bought this thinking it was a new work, but it is in fact his original thesis from 1965. That said, it's still worth having and reading, regardless of one's denomination."
5,Incredible music and Powerful vocals,"I first saw Oskar Saville in Chicago when she was playing with Rubygrass and was totally captivated by her performance. I purchased their ""Fireflies"" CD and have played it a countless number times. It's been quite a while waiting for a follow-up to that CD. However, ""A Girl Named Oskar"" was well worth the wait (although hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the next one). Oskar is an amazing talent - her vocals are outstanding, her lyrics and music are great and she has a tremendous stage pressence. I highly recommend this CD - if you only buy one CD this year, this is it. You'll be hearing alot about Oskar Saville in the future - so get this CD now. If you get a chance to catch a live performance, don't miss it, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Phone not working,"Sir/Mam,I bought unlocked phone but it is not detecting my Airtel / Reliance simcard (In India). Is there any other interfacing software required to activate that. While purchasing, seller has assured me that it'll work in any netword since it was in unlocheked condition but it very odd feeling for me that seller lied with me.I'll appreciate you, if you provide solution for that.Amit (amitk_vnit@yahoo.com)"
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,"The story of the Champolion must be fascinating and someday I would like to read about it. I hoped that this book would be such a story, instead it turned out to be a confused mishmash of barely related stories with a bare minimum of information about Champollion and his quest. This must be the shotiest book I have ever read, below even amateur efforts. Avoid at all costs."
1,Completely Broke,"This product broke during install. When I first received the lock, one of the keys was already inserted into it. That didn't seem to be a problem at first, except when I attempted to pull it out. The key was stuck in the lock and after some coaxing I was able to remove it. Every time I inserted one of the keys it appeared to get stuck. I sprayed the keyhole with some WD-40 and it appeared to make it easier to remove the key. During installation, I wasn't able to turn the key completely into the locked position (making it impossible to remove the key). I removed the cam and the entire lock cylinder fell out, spilling all the pins and springs of the locking mechanism everywhere. I collected all the pieces and it appears that a few of the springs were completely bent out of shape."
1,Poor quality,I must say this pick-up sounded really good up until it stopped picking up the guitar and only produced a loud buzz. This happened after about a year of ownership. I was always very careful with this as well. My friend also bought one after he heard mine but his broke too. These things do not last. Don't buy one.
1,Incorrect tech advice,"I selected this pick-up due to the great reviews. Other advertised pick-ups were clear on sound hole diameter limits but this one made no mention. I called the company prior to purchase and gave model and size (Yamaha G231II 3.5 inch sound hole) and was assured it would be a fit. It is not a fit. I'm keeping it to see if it will fit my Fender 12 string, out on loan and returning to me at the end of June. If not, maybe I can sell it.What do you say to updating your Amazon specs page to include parameters and restrictions? (Don't ask the guy in the back room I was transferred to.) Sure would have saved my time, money and energy."
4,Honneger par excellence,"The French really haven't made an impact with the symphony with the possible exception of Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique which has remained in the concert halls while Frank's murky symphony in D and Saint Saens Organ symphony have been pushed aside by Mahler, Stravinsky, Bartok and other composers who captured the public in the latter half of the 20th century. These works by Honneger are comparable to and oddly sometimes sound like American symphonies from the same time period but without the awful folk references that trivialize so many American works. Here we have several works of typical French lightness and deftness but also some depth and poignance. It's not Beethoven and it's not Mahler, it's Honneger. To some it may be little more than wallpaper but it's French wallpaper. You probably already know Dutoit's reputation in the repertoire."
2,Disappointing,"Dutoit's rep in French music led me to buy this set. However, I've been disenchanted with Dutoit for a while. Early on, he had the laudable virtues of lightness and grace. He has become ponderous. I'm not saying that the Honegger symphonies aren't serious, but they *are* contrapuntal, and under Dutoit's leaden baton, they turn to mud. Far better (though certainly not perfect) are the sets by Serge Baudo and Fabio Luisi. There are fine individual performances by Munch, Ansermet, Karajan, and Markevitch. Honegger's symphonies are among the best of the 20th century. They deserve better than this."
3,Head bolt half set,"I must clarify. The bolts themselves are as I expected and worked fine. It was the information and description of the product that I have issue with. I think of ""Head bolt set"" as being enough head bolts to replace all of them on the engine. This is not the case. They are very expensive and you have to buy two sets! Not cool."
1,"Good cleaner, poor scratch remover","Tried this product on glasses (plastic lense) and cell phone screen. Tried multiple applications and a lot of rubbing, but it had no effect on even small scratches. It is a good lense cleaner."
1,Close but no cigar,"I got this hoping to use with my 5th generation iPod nano. I had a bunch of scratches, some moderately deep, other minor. This stuff didn't even touch the minor ones. I rubbed with a cotten pad: nothing happened. I tried i dremel: nothing happened. I think that the reason it works for the previous ipods, and not mine is because the 4th and 5th gen ipod screens are made out of scratch resistant glass. This stuff works better for plastic displays. The bottom line: Save your $money$."
1,Scratches way worse,All this did for my camera was make the scratches I already had more noticeable and add a few extra along with it.
2,Use this product with caution,"I used Displex to remove a tiny but deep scratch on the screen of my new Samsung Blackjack. As I polished, the scratch began to grow flatter and wider. I just assumed that was normal. So, being the optimist I am, I continued to work at it. After several applications, I ended up with a 1/4-inch diameter ""dimple"" on the screen that is much more noticeable than the original scratch!This product might work well on small, fine abrasions, but use with caution on deep scratches."
4,Good but it aint easy,"This product works, mostly. If you have pretty deep scratches on your electronic device (in my case a PSP), you'll need to do some extra hard scrubbing with this stuff. I was able to mostly get rid of the scratches, but it took some work. Make sure that you realize that this stuff aint magic, that it's going to require some work from you. When it buffs out the deep scratch it leaves what looks sort of like a smudge, but that's only visible in a certain light at a certain angle, this in turn buffs out the scratch. A good product."
1,Cowardly,"Well this certainly isn't Pascal. Or C.S. Lewis even.Let's see there are straw men set up to be knocked down, lazy generalizations, what one could generously call Pascalian leaps of faith or perhaps just sleights of hands, and a nice helping of cynical pandering to perceived right wing audience...do I scent the work of David Limbaugh? Yes indeed, he writes the intro and sets the tone. I guess what gives me enough faith to find this book in bad faith. For instance should someone who writes for a heretical cult like the Moonies (as our boy David does via the Washington Times) really feel fit to lecture the rest of us about Christianity or morals or even elementary logic? I think not.Oh and any ""athiests"" who were converted by this book I have some real estate I would love to sell you..."
1,NAZI style propoganda,"With such an interesting title I could'nt pass this one up. When I saw Mr. Turek speak online in one of his videos I thought he might have some creditals. Indeed on the back on this book it says he has some degrees. It was'nt until I went to his website that I found out he has no degrees in science. He has a degree in Christian apologetics and a masters in public administration. In other words he is nothing more than a motivational speaker. The book is anything but critical science. The author(s) bombard the reader with straw-man anologies, cherry-picking, circular logic, and ""nazi type propoganda. I'm surprised Turek/Geisler did'nt offer a ""final solution"" to deal with the atheist problem. More to follow...."
4,Great read!,Very thoughtful answers to give to those who don't believe in intelligent design and who refuse to acknowledge the history of the bible. Scientific reasons for believing in creation over evolution.
1,Certainly not written with atheists in mind.,"This was dropped on my doorstep one evening by an anonymous concernced Christian. After being so angry at the complete arrogance of the action (when do atheists leave material on people's doorsteps, dr.'s offices, bus stops, etc.?), I decided I would crack it open. Well...on the first page, the foreword, it states, ""Proof, of course, is no substitute for faith, which is essential to our salvation and for our communion with God."" For any atheist that values scientific evidence, this statement is unacceptable, illogical, and makes the rest of the book invalid."
1,zero stars was not an option . . .but it's what it deserves,"really stupid book. very predictable. flat characters. granted, i don't expect great ""literature"" from the romance genre but expect and generally receive entertainment and escapism. but this book provided neither. it is first kane book i've read and it will be my last. save your time and your money. don't bother with this one."
5,A compelling work,"Alexander's conclusion about the strategic value of Stonewall Jackson is notable, and worthy of study. It also fits with the portrait of Jackson painted by Burke Davis in his biography ""They Called Him Stonewall."" Jackson, had he been allowed to, and properly equipped, could very well have won the war before 1863. Had he taken the war to the North, and had Lee's disastrous and bloody Seven Days been averted, there might be two American nations on the continent."
1,dont waste your money,"This is a very cheaply made item. My bird wont even use it, its too small of an area where the water comes out. Don't waste your money. Get a larger glass bottle waterer."
2,Better for the younger set,"This game markets itself as appropriate for 4-6 year olds. I bought this for my 5 year old and she beat it in less than 30 minutes. The game itself is extremely short - only 6 activities. This may be better for 3 and 4 year olds just learning to count and learn shapes. But for those already competent or even familiar with them, its a waste of money."
2,Buyer beware !!!,"In a word - sad. Did Mick Box forget how to play solos or what?? If you think you're getting anything close to old Heep you're in for a shock. What you will get is a semi-documentary on the current lineup only, but unfortunately they are sorry replacements for Dave Byron and especially Ken Hensley. You would think that Mick Box would step up and carry the group now but instead he raises the white flag with lame guitar playing galore. Even on songs like Gypsy, which begs for a great wah-wah solo like he used to do, he wimps out big time. In addition, the fact that the lead singer is one of the most femmy dudes (especially in the Moscow show) ever to hit the stage doesn't help. And please, don't even get me started on that joke of a keyboard player. So, don't let the great Roger Dean cover artwork fool you. Get some other classic live Heep and if you can't find it, be happy with your memories."
1,TERRIBLE GUN & USELESS TAPE!!!,"I had the earlier ""non-safety"" model of this dispenser for 10+ years and it worked just fine until duct tape could no longer hold certain parts together anymore. This new retractable 'safety' blade is a complete pain... someone's gonna get hurt being 'safe'. Don't waste your money or your time. Get one of the other models without a retractable blade and in order for it to be ""safe"", put it away when you're finished... don't leave it lying around anywhere, and tell your children it's ""not safe for children""... only to be used by tool saavy grown-ups please. Some versions have a free roll of tape that comes with and it's for the trash too! Use a 3M dispenser with Duck HD double-roll tape. I do a LOT of packaging and it's the combo I prefer. I'm ordering the Duck Shark dispenser today to see how that is too. I love the tape and hoping to love the Shark just as much!"
1,Garbage,This is one of those products that is completely useless. I tried following the unclear diagram for loading the tape and apparently it just passed through the metal gate and roller and that's it. You still have to place it by hand on the box and then it is very difficult to cut. It would actually be easier and faster to just put the roll of tape on your wrist and have a scissors in the other hand. It's just that absolutely useless. The people who posted the positive reviews must either work for 3M or sell them for a living !
4,"Old faces, new plot","The book you should read after ""Whispering Woods"". Garth and Noreen from ""Arena"" return. Noreen, as a main character, has a fling with Gull. But she's married to Garth, a master magician! This causes guilt in Noreen and a fight near the end between Gull and Garth. Readers of ""Whispering Woods"" will know, along with other important plot points, that Gull has no magic. Garth appears only in beginning and end. Read ""Final Sacrifice"" after this"
4,Works great...,"I received the memory in a decent amount of time, shut down my computer and installed the memory chips all within a half hour. I had gone from 333mb to 1.8gb in half hour. Works great so far."
4,Works great with my P4P800 Deluxe,"i recently upgraded from 1GB Geil PC3500 ram to this 2GB of Kingston PC3200 RAM and its a world of difference.no more timing issues, computer never reboots under high load anymore, plus this ram should work fin eif i ever upgraded to another DDR motherboard"
2,no improvement in performance,I replaced my 500 meg with 2gb on my six year old desktop computer. I don't see noticeable performance improvement. It may be that the other components are not compatible or outdated.
1,"Poor shipping methods, false advertising!","Don't order anything using the Super saver method if you really want your items ever sent to you! 5-9 Business days turns into 2 weeks or longer! I ordered on a Sunday giving them all day Monday to prepare my order and it's now Wednesday and it still hasn't shipped! I ordered on the 16th of May with an estimated delivery of the 21st. Now I'm being told that I'll not be seeing it until June 4th if that!!! This is not the first time I've had this type of issue with Amazon. I tried ordering a Channel Master antenna with a different type of shipping method, I paid for it instead of it being sent super saver. They strung me along for over a month continuously reassuring me that it will get here and it never did! The next time I tried inquiring about it or looking up my order they had canceled it all out like it never happened! I won't be ordering from them again."
5,It works great!!,This product works great and it was easy to install... we noticed inmediate speed performance after the installation.. great stuff for half the price of the brand names!!!!
2,Kingston 2GBKIT 400MHZ DDR PC3200,I have multiple computers and I have bought RAM for them all. I thought I was getting a good deal here with the Kingston 2GBKIT 400MHZ DDR PC3200 but I was wrong. One of the sticks were bad when I got it out of the box it doesn't work with any of my computers(all take 400MHZ DDR) The other stick works and I still use it but I was had and I hope you don't have the same experience.
5,WYSIWYG -- for a good price,"Exactly what I ordered, easy snap out old RAM, snap in new RAM, just like it is supposed to work. Came well packaged. Better price than competition, but shipping was a tad high. Did what I wanted it to do, upgraded from 2GB of RAM to 4GB of RAM, enabled me to upgrade to Windows Vista with no slowdown in system performance. Baseline Vista takes ~1.3GB of RAM on my system w/o Aero, ~2.3GB of RAM with Aero. Leaves me with enough overhead to operate any application, including video games without stressing memory."
1,Kingston PC3200 1Gb memory,"Did not seem to work or, at best, worked intermittently. I have a 512mb stick which is essentially identical except for capacity. I thought, at first, that that it would not work because I paired it with the 512 stick but it also failed alone. The errors occurred during boot. Would not find the system disk and, also, some other error which I can't remember."
2,Far too obscure,"I picked this book up, because I'm interested in getting a high level overview of Nietzsche. The title read Very Short Introduction, so I assumed it would be a great starting point to figure out if I would want to dive into some of Nietzsche complete works and study him over time. Now, I'm not an English major, but I do hold a Masters degree, so I am educated. I found this book terrible in communicating its point. Yes, Tanner has a wonderful command of the English language, but does his book really need to require a dictionary to read? It's almost as if he ran it through a software thesaurus that converted every word to the most obscure word he could possibly use. Yes, Mr. Tanner your language is impressive, but if the average reader, like me, can't understand you then what's the point? Keep it simple; always use the simplest most widely used words to communicate the point. Anything else is just egotistical in my opinion."
3,Decent...not great,I download this for my kindle and really never got passed a few pages due to the way it is written.It may have been a decent read otherwise.I recommend for anyone using a kindle and loves true ghost stories to check out the Kindle Book/Blog/Magazine below:True Ghost Stories
1,Real Ghost Stories,The book did not keep my interest. It bounced around from subject to subject. I plan on finishing the book just because that is me however is going to take me awhile.
4,"Excellent installment in a ""series""","[b]Starbrat[/b] is one book in an interconnected ""series"" by Morressy. The other two books, [b]Stardrift[/b] and [b]Under a Calculating Star[/b], are equally good, if not better. Each book can stand completely alone, but various characters cameo in each novel. This is a dark future where man has reached the stars, but can no longer replicate the technology of his ancestors. Still, the starships endure, to carry mankind on to more bloody adventures. A fast-paced, well-written book.Note: two more books set several centuries later are [b]Frostworld and Dreamfire[/b] and [b]The Mansions of Space[/b]."
5,The latin jazz record of the year.,"Just the day I return to Lima , he played in manhattan (Jul 17). this record is FIRE...like Live & in clave, this year bobby must win the latin jazz Grammy."
3,"Respectable, but get Kenya Live","Sanabria is to be respected no matter what he does, and this isn't a bad record. It is also to be commended for its adventurous and wandering soul (""The Grand Wazoo""? Nice touch!). It is a great technical record.But Sanabria is fun to see and hear when he really gets cooking. Get ""Kenya Live"" first. See how much fun his arrangement style can REALLY be."
5,Okay!,"I am replying to ""Alicia Silverstone's"" Review. Do your research before you say something!!! You are being an idiot! I think these dolls, if maybe a little revealing, are just like anything else a child might be seeing on tv. For example; britney spears and avril lavigne and christina aguilara all make these dolls look like angels. And for another thing, Tokyo is a very interesting city, and the crime rate is lower in japan than in most places. Also, the bratz were vacationing in japan, so they dont look japanese, but the kimono collectors dolls do. So yes, I am calling you stupid...or ""baka"" in japanese, a culture you seem to judge while knowing nothing about it."
1,Great.................. (for a 20 year old!!),"The phrase ""every day's a fashion show"" is stupid! 6+? yeah right!!! They party all night!! AAAAAATTTTTTTTTEEEEENNNNNTTIIOOOONNN AALLLLLLLL PPPPPPAAAAAAAARRRRRRRREEEEEEENNNNNNNTTTTTTTTSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! They wear thongs! If you don't want a stripper teen then don't buy bratz!!! The only reason they made this playset is that if they didn't, tokyo would sue!"

AAAAAATTTTTTTTTEEEEENNNNNTTIIOOOONNN AALLLLLLLL PPPPPPAAAAAAAARRRRRRRREEEEEEENNNNNNNTTTTTTTTSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! They wear thongs! If you don't want a stripper teen then don't buy bratz!!! I hate bratz."
2,Had to buy 3 to get one that worked,Because of the needs of our small office I was determined to get a small water cooler/heater and this was the only model I could find.The 3rd unit seems to be fine (I returned the other two because they were defective and either didn't heat or didn't cool the water.Flush the unit well and run a little vinagar and water through it to get rid of the plastic taste.
1,Packaging still a problem,"Great films, (I've seen most of them before--checked out from the public library) but packaging is still a problem--mine still came in the cardboard packaging, with the disks held in slots in the cardboard. Whether or not the packaging is the cause, the first disk I tried kept stopping and finally wouldn't play at all, so I'm returning the whole set."
3,Newton Rules,Better than the titles would lead one to believe...especially good if you know little about Newton's fascinating life.
1,Faye should stick with Decker/Lazarus series,I couldn't get in this book. Faye Kellerman should stay with Peter and Rina. This series is really great!
2,very disappointing,I bought this book because I live in Las Vegas and I wanted a intelligent thriller about the area. I was disappointed by the unrealistic science fiction theme. I have heard that some of her other books are better but this one I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're into science fiction crime dramas.
3,DISAPPOINTING,"I ORDERED 'MOON MUSIC' AND 'THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY LAST WEEK AND JUST FINISHED 'MOON MUSIC'. I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WASN'T VERY GOOD. IT JUST FELL FLAT, IT'S NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS HER OTHER NOVELS."
1,Oh My God!,"I love both Faye and Jonathon Kellerman. Their books have always kept me enthralled, and I am usually dissapointed when I get to the end of them - not because I was dissatisfied, but because the book was so good I didn't want it to end! Well, Faye took care of that for me this time! What a GREAT dissapointment this book was. I had it figured out early on, but I thought it was a workable idea - so I continued to fight my way through the book. I shouldn't have wasted my time. It was horrible. She would bring in new scenarios or characters in such a way that you would think you must have missed something earlier on. She made it sound like it was the second or third time she had brought them up, and I'd flip through the pages I had already read to see where they were mentioned - but they were never there. I was so dissapointed in this book. Not up to her Decker/Lazarus books by a long shot! Don't waste your money on this one! Don't even use your Library card for it!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!,This is the first book I've read by Kellerman and the last! It's whole plot is way overdone and unbelievable. The descriptions of how the detectives are running their investigation don't ring true. The characters and the relationships between them are very poorly defined. I usually pass books on to my friends when I'm finished reading them. This one went right in the trash!
2,Moon Music a Disappointment,"Stephen King fans will love this book; Faye Kellerman fans will be vastly disappointed. As for the threat that the supernatural villain will return in a future episode, please spare us."
1,A real stinker,"I usually like Faye Kellerman's work, so I was excited to read this book. What a disappointment! Perhaps the worst thing about the book is that you don't realize until about 300+ pages into it that it is so, so awful. By that time, you don't know whether to keep reading and hope for the best (which is what I did) or cut your losses immediately. For those of you who haven't yet read the book, let me save you the trouble of making that decision--just don't start the book. Pick up another Faye Kellerman instead. This one stinks!"
2,No Fair!,"I usually love Faye Kellerman's books but this one was a real let down. I won't give the plot away, but as a compulsive and well-read mystery reader I felt absolutely cheated at the denoument. The author did not play fair with her readers."
2,A big disappointment from one of my favorite authors,"I've read all of Faye Kellerman's books and loved them. She writes strong characters who I get very involved with. This book was a departure from that. I never warmed up to or really became interested in any of these characters. And she completely lost me toward the end when things went into the relm of fantasy. I have faith in this author, though, and will buy her next book, even if it isn't a Decker--Lazarus mystery. But I really need to be pulled in more than this book allowed me to be. My suggestion for other readers is to skip this one and wait for her next one."
2,An unpleasant disappointment,"This is the first time that I have been disappointed in a book by Faye Kellerman. All of the main characters were unpleasant, with the single exception of Patricia. There was way too much emphasis on sexual activity, and the whole transformation business never became believable. I've read lots of books with farfetched situations, but this time I was unable to attain the necessary suspension of belief required before I could buy into this. What an astounding bunch of misfits! It's time for the author to focus again on Peter and Rina."
1,It was not what I expected from Faye Kellerman.,"I settled in to read a book by one of my favorite authors. I felt so let down that I had to force myself to finish the book. In the end there were no redeeming factors, it was really bad. I donated the book to the library, maybe someone else can borrow it and save their money."
1,Disappointed in the plot.,"I've read almsot all of Faye Kellerman books and enjoy reading most of them. However, this book was a real disappointment; not because this wasn't a Decker/Rina character driven book, but because the plot was unbelievable and ridiculous."
1,car looks good but under the trunk?,looks good but right from the start didnt work. as soon as you open a valve down the line from the pump the previous valves stop working. plus the knob dont stop turning in either direction making trouble shooting difficult. what did work was a splitter and a 5cent valve
2,This game is simply sad!!,"This game sucks I'll tell you why!!!1)There is only a few amount of lines to choose from so after awhile it gets really hard to make a story line. I thought you can make up your own lines!!2)There isen't enough charactors in it,They only have about 5 charactors for every show.3)The graphics suck really bad. Some of them don't look good in 3d.The positive things about this game(^_^)1)Thier is pretty good backrounds on this game and good props to use.2)The most important charactors are in it.3)You can put your own voice on it which I haven't tried.After about a week it's not fun anymore!!!"
3,Book o.k. Amazon's sale presentation terrible!,"The book is average for texts of this type. However, Amazon's presentation of the book for prospective customers is terrible! Unlike many other books they sell, they DO NOT allow you to see a table of contents, index, or sample pages. They seem to want the customer to ""buy a pig in a poke."" That's Amazon's fault--not the author's. I passed on purchase, not because the book is bad, but because Amazon does not seem to want to share what's in this particular book."
2,Rod is really weak,"Lots of stuff for the money if you buy the version that comes with line, but the rod broke way, WAY too easily. Not good for fish over 12 inches / 1lb or so IMO. Not bad for pan sized trout in the backcountry though..."
1,No good,"Seems like a good deal except you need to get fly line and ""normal"" line, a leader and backing. You can get a ""ready to fish"" kit for about 100 bucks and maybe it won't BREAK THE TIP OFF WHILE YOU ARE SPOOLING LINE ONTO IT!!! This pole is amazingly weak. Would rate it at -1 star as well."
2,Span--the kind that comes in a can,I travel to Hawaii quite often and you see Spam everywhere. I thought this book would make a funny Christmas gift for my niece and that is why I bought it. There isn't anything in it you couldn't figure out for yourself--just substitute Span for any other meat and you'd get the general idea. But it's fun and inexpensive if you also want to give a mainlander a funny gift.
3,"Does what it says, but is very fragile.","This Dual Lock creates a great bond for even heavy things. I was using it on my guitar pedalboard with decent success. One warning though: the little mushroom / fingers are VERY easily bent just by pressing on them with your finger (for example: trying to stick down the adhesive to a surface). They deform and don't move back into place. If your application isn't semi-permanent, you are better off with another type of (more durable) velcro."
2,I don't like it.,"This is nothing like velcro. Velcro has 2 different face materials while this just has one. You have to very firmly press the two pieces together and they kind of ""snap"" together. Since it's harder to mate the two sides than velcro it doesn't work as well for things you un-attach and re-attach frequently. It doesn't hold as well as the heavy duty velcro I've replaced it with."
3,"Good historical reference from 1997, but much better ones now available","This documentary, from 1997, is narrated by Martin Sheen. In my view, that's a plus. Moreover, the research aspects of the dvd are from a French perspective. That makes it different from the American or Russian views. Still, this disk has to be regarded as dated and lacking the latest scientifice analyses. In comparison to the NatGeo production, ""Titanic's Achilles Heel,"" for example, this disk has been superseded. Moreover, it lacks subtitles and time indicators. It claims to run 50 minutes, which I believe is the minimum. But there was no way for me to check that as the dvd ran. There is a scene index, but again, no time remaining advice. If available at a moderate price, I'd advise people to buy this dvd in the secondary market as it seems to be out-of-print. But there are newer ones that are far better."
5,The bestest and most powerful of the SPD megazords!!!!,"I've got another one from japan last christmas and it rocked!!!! And best of all, unlike all other megazords, the Supreme/SWAT(as called in the show)Megazord has the exact same paint job and colors like the japanese version!!! Its totally the bestest megazord in Power Rangers history!!! And if you watched this zord in TV, you'll see how much it kicks butt!! So get it already if you're a Power Ranger fan!!!!"
4,Ricoh Aficio AP610N works for me,"I'm an accountant and do approximately 40,000 pages per year. I have been using this machine for about 2 years and have nothing bad to say about it.It has way more features than I can possibly comprehend.I use it for 8 1/2 x 11 std 20# pages and it is a workhorse. Few jams or issues. I was cautioned by my salesperson to avoid heavy stock paper.I have done mailing labels with no issues.I love that it can do 11 x 17. Just amazing on this size machine.It is fast and wakes up quickly.My support guy was shocked that Ricoh has it set for major maintenance part replacement at 100,000 pages. That is not cheap -- parts $350 and labor additional.Cartridges are not cheap but they yield approximately 20,000 pages.I'm a very satisfied user."
5,Great game!!,"This is a great game. It took a little while to figure out the object of the game but once I did it's great. It would have been easier if I would have read the instructions first instead of trial and error. My five year old daughter loves the graphics. She plays it all by herself and is already good at it. (we just got it today.) It's a really cute game.I read in another review that it's not such a great game. The woman mentioned she had a 2 year old. Well, the box says for 4 to 6 years old. It's definitely not for a 2 year old.I had no problem installing the game and I just dragged the shortcut onto the desktop. I'm glad I bought it."
2,Not happy,This game has not worked well since it was loaded on the computer. We own two other versions and do not have trouble with those two.
5,I Spy Fantasy,"Enjoyable for the whole family but geared to 6-10 year olds. If you like the books, you'll love this game!"
5,A fascinating study filled with relevant information...,This book takes a serious look into the complaints of atheists and agnostics over the centuries. Wilson has an elegant writing style and provides illustrations from the past and present. He also incorporates numerous views from those who believe in God and those who do not. Delightful reading for atheist or believer or those who check undecided when asked about their belief in God.
5,Great bag for the price.,"I was a little nervous about getting this bag since it was so cheap. Of course after adding the $10.99 S&H it wasn't all that cheap anymore, but still a good price. Mainly I just wanted a solid black gym bag so I could take my bodybuilding stuff with me while in my Army PT uniform and not be told I was out of regulation. It is definitely solid black and will work very well to maintain regulation standards. It is a very roomy bag and feels more durable than I thought it would. The clips that hold the shoulder strap to the bag are plastic, so we'll have to see how long they last. All-in-all a good buy for me."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Colors are all similar & the polishes are low quality. I literally received 8 bottles of Love My Nails polishes, which can be purchased for 99 cents at many stores. This is not a $129.99 value, as it states under the product info. I was going to give this to a friend as a Christmas present, but would be completely embarrassed. I guess that's what I get for going into this blind & allowing them to choose the 20 polishes to put in my order. Do not make the same mistake I did! To the seller: maybe you should let the customer know exactly which polishes you plan on giving the customer before you send them 4 of the same shade polish (which is what happened to me!). Or maybe you should let the customer choose which colors/brands they would like. Because the system you have now is not customer-friendly & frankly, it's sketch. Can't believe I fell for it, but at least I have time to return it. Customers, SAVE YOUR MONEY. DO NOT BUY."
1,My mistake!,"I read a warning review that should not buy it. But i still made mistake. It came with 80% red and dark color, some couldn't use the brush, 1 is sample and 1 had no brush. They said no sample, no same color,.. But it was almost same color.. Again! Don't buy it..."
2,3 of 20 broke!,Just received my order ... in a thin priority mail document envelope! It is leaking and has an intense odor.Not only a mess but most colors are glittery and ugly. Should I even bother putting any in my girlfriends stocking?Next time spring for a box when shipping!
2,Product damaged during transit,"The neck was completely broken off of one bottle of nail polish. The nail polish from the broken bottle ran all over the rest of the botlles making the product unacceptable. The product was very poorly packed. All these glass bottles were loosely put in the box with a totally inadequate amount of ""peanuts""."
5,"GOOD DEAL! FAST, FAST shipper.",It made my grandson very happy and there is nothing wrong with that!Great seller and shipping was fassssst!My grandson is also learning Japanese and watching in the original version is very helpful.
2,Some Basic Info..,"I looked forward to getting this book for a long time, and now that I have it I'm a bit disappointed..it's a very quick read and while it does offer basic information for beginners (and there's something to be said for that!) it goes so far into detail and explanation of even simple words, I found myself losing interest. Also, though there are technically 139 pages, most have only a few words or one or two short chants, and several are blank pages to be used as a starting point for a Book of Shadows. It only took me about an hour to read. Plus I was slightly offended about the author telling us every detail of how to perform the magic and record it in our Book of Shadows. She states that we MUST write in our BOS at least weekly; well, I thought Wicca was supposed to be about individuality! I also recently purchased ""Be a Teen Goddess"" by Francesca De Grandis, and I thought De Grandis pulled the teen book off much better."
4,A parody is not an improvement,"I enjoyed Snowcrashed as a parody of Snow Crash and cyberpunk books. I do not share other reviewer's opinion that it is better than those other books. In fact, Headcrashed will only make sense if you have read those other books."
2,What a weak ending,"It's kind of like Dilbert as a narrative--but not as good. The book has an interesting premise, is quite amusing in bits, and the author had absolutely no idea how to end the story. Bethke also has some serious grammatical problems with his writing. If spelling and grammar mean anything to you as a reader, you should give this one a miss."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"I purchased the product because it offered Microsoft .Net compatibility. The product locks up regularly for no apparent reason. When it locks up the only option is to reset, clearing all data and software installs. If you purchase the product get very familiar with Backup and Restore procedures. I am currently restoring the system once per week."
5,One of the Best Sets,"Well being a tournament player I recomend this,Why?, well many cards from this set are in every serious yu-gi-oh players deck, although serious meaning alot of time and money put into this game and I am not saying you will get all of these cards in this box but some good ones are-Magic cylander-one of the best traps in game-Gemini Elf-best level 4> card with NO drawback effect-Kyoco the Ghost Destroyer- neccesariy in beatdown decks-Bazoo the Soul Eater-same as above-United We Stand- best power-up in game-Mage Power-second best power up in game-Torrential Tribute- a Great field Clearer-Dark NecroFear-FEAR IT-The Masked Beast- Can you say Power?FINAL Destiny- there is destiny board and spirit messages I,N,A,Lwhen you get all those onto the field you winthose are a few of the great cards around that any deck could benifit from a must buy"
2,Bad Buy,What a piece of junk. Unless you have an iPod shuffle the screen is upside down because of the stupid tripod shape. Sound quality is decent. Very lightweight and portable.
3,Teacher and Engineer,This book is ok for the beginner or undergradute student. The materil is not very detailed. It is good for the introduction for people who is usign Egnlish as a secound languge.
4,"Good, compact adapter for FireWire varieties.","A Mac user for several years I've collected several FireWire devices and cables. Through those years the ports have changed: 400 was prevalent, now 800 is all that's left. Adapters like this one are perfect for repurposing the connectors. Originally gotten for an older iPod which still supports FireWire. Battery shot, I couldn't add any extra media to it, needed FireWire to power it while syncing. My current Mac only has 800 connectors which made my cable useless. This adapter was perfect. I also find it useful with 400-to-400 cables for external drives when using with newer connectors.Without such an adapter, legacy devices and cables would be inaccessible, unusable. While it only permits 400 Mb/s throughput, it at least allows connection. Tight fit in ports, it's a great solution at a better price than on most sites."
4,"Eureka, it works!","I had an external hard drive that only had a FireWire 400 connection, while my MacBook Pro only had a FireWire 800 port. With the power of this magical thingamajig, I can now access all my files!A-ma-zing!Now if only it weren't so expensive..."
3,Performance is Better but with weird grinding noise!,Item came in on time and looked fine. Installed on a 3-series BMW with new rotors. Brake dust is much less now and performance s fine but its giving off a strange grinding noise almost similar to as if you have a worn out pad with its metal to rotor grinding scenario.
1,made mistake in ordering two,i thought i only ordered one of cenima rapsodhies of victor young i mistakenly got one from amzon and one from movie arts i have sent back the one from moviearts and hope for a refund
3,"Musically brilliant, mix down the lyrics.","I have loved Morrisey's work since the early days with The Smiths. I have virtually every CD now, all the import B sides, etc. This is the first Morrisey CD that I find nearly unlistenable because of his ""over the top"" whining, complaining, lyrics. How can someone fit so many boringly dreary complaints about the world and life into one CD? The lyrics are loud and VERY intelligible, it made me yearn for a ""mix it yourself"" CD where I could find the ""dismal"" slider and bring it down about 30 notches. The 3 stars are for the music and his wonderful voice, I can't stand his arrogant depressive whining on this one."
1,"Insipid, Uninspired Tripe","What a sad, sad effort, here. It's almost as if Mr. M was simply trying to throw the record company a bone, to placate them as they pressured him into rushing his next (final?) release.Morrissey, like Madonna, is struggling to retain relevance. And it is quite obvious. Both of them (like Eminem) have chosen to take the shock value path to selling records.Word to your mother, Vanilla Morrissey: The end is near.How soon is the end of Morrissey's career? Not soon enough."
4,All In Stride,"Nobody likes being told where to shove their hamburger, but anyone that is as seriously insulted by this as several people seem to be - willing to tear the entire album down because they've had their feelings hurt, needs to calm down. Morrissey needs to be handled with kid gloves, sort of taken with a grain of salt. Anyone that understands who he is, and what he's like can overlook this and say: ""Eh, it's just Morrissey."" It's like a mentally handicapped child screaming in the back of public gathering- it's annoying, but you take it in stride.As per the rest of the album, it's a very, almost neurotically dramatic collection of songs which blend together exceedingly well. ""First of the Gang to Die"" is by far the best track, and the others fit in line in various places of quality.I'm giving it a 3 1/2 out of five, rounding up for the stars."
1,I agree,"I agree with Diane in Phoenix... I am a supporter of freedom of speech, but this is just stupid. I should have listened to her review to begin with. When I put in this CD and heard the first song, I wanted to throw the CD out the window! If Morressey is so upset about what is going on in the world, why not take a PRO-ACTIVE approach and try to make things better rather than grumping about it all?Not to mention, the music is annoying and barely listenable. Save your money. Buy a CD by an artist that is part of the solution, rather than part of the whining.I am proud to be a supporter of our country and our president and if that makes me a crazy red neck, then maybe I'll just move to Phoenix and Diane and I can work on trying to solve this country's problems instead of just sitting around bitching about them and stirring up anti-American views."
4,"Beauty, mate!","It's 20 years on, and Morrissey is still the thinking man's singer/songwriter. ""You are the Quarry,"" released on the newly resuscitated Attack Records label, is a collection of gems.From the self-depreciating ""I have Forgiven Jesus"" and the anthemic first single ""Irish Blood, English Heart,"" to the lacerating wit of ""The World is Full of Crashing Bores"" and violent romanticism of ""The First of the Gang to Die,"" Morrissey is in top form. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, his soothing voice has never sounded more natural. And the music is rife with emotion; pure sonic genius. The lads are spot on!This album essentially rivals the greatness of ""Vauxhall and I."" In three words, ""Quarry"" is...brilliant, fantastic, superb!By the way, Moz, the truth is Jesus loves you. God cares about you, and He (obviously) has a wonderful plan for your life. Cheers for the last 20 years."
4,A Beginner's Point of View,"Please bear in mind that I am quite the novice.I bought this book for a quilting class I took. We made a table runner from one of the patterns. The quilt shop had offered several classes based on this book and it was quite popular. The quilts on display were fabulous.However, as a beginner, without the hands-on assistance at the class, I would have struggled with the pattern and probably given up!That being said, if you have any quilting experience I think you would like this book! It has great illustrations, helpful grids for designing your own variations, and clever nine-patch patterns. The nine-patch was fun to work with and my table runner is striking. And the book has inspired me to try another nine-patch."
1,I concur,"I concur with the majority of reviewers here in that this is a very dull recording from a one time rad musician.Boulez has become ""everything"" he once railed against and the majority of his recordings over the last 10 years (especially his dreadful Mahler recordings)show a dissillusioned and dissapointed musician.Yes, Pierre has undoubtedly become the most powerful conductor of this generation.But, in his lust for power, he has sold out his fellow modernists and consequently has caved into producing the populist repertoire.Unfortunately,one feels him going through the motions here and just about everywhere.This recording unfortunately justifies the 'anti-classical' types view that such music is outdated and sleep inducing.THE Boulez, one time rad modernist, producing 'easy listening' elevator musak?Groan. the hypocricy.Avoid this at all costs."
1,Plagiarism allowed?,"...It's bad. This book is really bad.If one does want to read something meaningful about the second-generation Indian American experience, I suggest ""Stealing The Ambassador"" also written by an Indian doctor. (What is with these guys? Study of medicine not time-consuming enough?) In fact, I think the author of Reinkarmation should read that book. Maybe he could come up with version 2.0 of his book. Or is that what software engineers (like myself) would do?"
2,"Harmless, but uninspiring","Take a generic middle school fantasy and then simplify, simplify, simplify until it is almost just an outline of a book. Now, who wants to read this?It's no good for story time reading because there is nothing to engage a little kid's imagination. There is nothing interesting for the child to follow. It's just an outline. Might as well read him an outline of ""War and Peace"".But, it's no good for an older reader, because it is too simple and simple-minded.So, I don't quite know who would want this. It is about the equivalent of reading Sugar Bear adventures on a cereal box. It might be interesting to a very first time reader. Sentences are short and simple. All easy words. Mostly all simple declarative sentences. I could see having one or two of these as a sort of intro/bridge reader in your kid's library, but boy I don't see having more.Try the sample, above. And remember, there are usually scads of these at ayrd sales for a dime each.)"
4,Interesting read for the most part - a little bit much at times,"This book was recommended to me by some fellow Marines from Nam days. I bought it and its a good read, with some real interesting points. At times the Author I think tries a little hard to share the 'victory' and those of us that fought their get it but those that didnt wont so ... overall he shares some much needed perspective on the war and one can see the Vietnam War in the current Iraqi debacle. Shame on our leaders once again."
2,Dorian Gray (1975 version),"I wasn't sure what to expect, having seen the version with Hurd Hatfield, which is excellent. This, no, not at all. It was pretty much a badly staged play. I usually like John Gielgud, but his acting in this was atrocious. The only person's acting I enjoyed was the young woman who played Sybil. The rest - very unnoteworthy."
5,Five stars plus!,Are you looking for a book that will present the solid facts on dinosaurs on a level anyone can understand? Look no further! Adults and children alike love this book. It's a book that will be used again and again.
4,Excellent book,"I have to smile at some of the other reviews I have read of this book. Evolutionists are squirming! In fact this book is one of many which are advancing the cause of creation while evolutionists are having to back down on many assumptions which weaken their arguments. Great illos, great script. I am buying it to start a young man on his journey toward true science and strengthen his faith in the God who made all things with intelligence."
1,Delightful craziness,"I really enjoyed this book for the outright silliness of it. God forbid my daughter should ever see it. The only thing that dampened my enjoyment was the thought that someone might actually take it seriously. We're Christian and respect a diversity of viewpoints but, wow, this thing is nuts."
2,Not a Keeper,"While I generally think it unfair to review a book when I haven't finished it, I could not bring myself to read past the second chapter. Life is too short, and this book appeared too trite to spend any more time on it. I don't like books where the characters are two-dimensional and their actions appear to depend on the author's need to move the plot along rather than on psychological honesty. When the hero clearly falls in love with the heroine the first time he sees her and she isn't even awake, I know it is time to put the book down and read something else."
4,Good Thermometer,"We have a 5 gallon fish tank that we need to ensure stays at least 76 degrees, this does the job perfectly"
2,Too small to read,"accuracy aside, this thermometer is too small to read. It has a hairline sized readout. not talking about the text, i'm talking about the red liquid that raises or decreases with temp changes."
2,It left permanent rings on my acrylic tank,"This is an ordinary thermometer, no big deal, but I must agree with what another reviewer said, i.e., the suction cups on this thermometer react somehow with my acrylic tank and left 2 permanent rings on my tank. It doesn't come out at all. Otherwise, a nice cheap little thermometer"
4,An excellent piece of WoD literature set in San Francisco.,"""The Beast Within,"" the first anthology released by White Wolf Publishing, is an excellent collection of short stories focusing around a three day period in the San Francisco Kindred population. From small power games to the riskiest and most daring of power plays, the city's Kindred cavort and consort in a seemingly unending dance of status and political power. From the opening tale, Blood Letters, to the final page of ""Prisons,"" Vannevar Thomas and all the rest cut a bloody swath across each other's unlives. I highly recommend it to all fans of vampire fiction and the World of Darkness."
5,phone charger,This is a 120V wall charger for Samsung cell I bought it to replace the one I lost works well very good value.
4,back on track,"when i first read romkey's I, Vampire, i was so impressed. here was a vampire book that was different from most, and outstandingly done. but as the ""series"" went on, the novels started to get weaker and weaker, but now, finally, romkey has written a novel as good as his first ones."
5,Wonderfully easy to use!,"I bought this edition because the version I had was too old to update. This was a real cost bargain, because the Collectors Edition was less money than the Deluxe Edition (at least on Amazon!), and is a better Edition. With more perks and features in the Collectors Edition, it is all I wanted in genealogy software. The free year with Ancestory.com that comes with the purchase of the Collectors Edition is the most useful bonus I can imagine. The new version merged perfectly with my previous version (I had version 6 and this new one is version 16!) and all my information was brought into this Edition without a hitch. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I would definitely recommend this software to anyone looking for an easy to use, comprehesive yet simple, genealogy program."
3,Not really review the the beauty of Niagara,"Though I haven't yet been to niagara falls, but it is obvious that some tracks in this album are just only relaxing, but not linked with the title: Niagara Falls - A Natural Wonder. They are just relaxing music but not carrying you to this natural wonder. I don't find myself getting any feelings of going to the niagara after listening to this. Even the nature sounds does not match with the title too. There are only a little waterfall sounds thoughtout the recording. I think you will only hear less than 5 minutes of waterfall sounds.Although there are still some tracks, like track 2, gives you a feeling of the niagara fall, but this is just a small proportion in the album. I would recommend Grand Canyon - a natural wonder instead. Also by dan gibson, this album really carries you to the natural wonder grand canyon. But this album does not give you such experience.But, if you are just looking for a CD to relax your body, this is still a good choice."
2,Lame,We put these on our registry for our wedding and we were excited to get them. We had been using cheap IKEA knives so this was definitely a step up. Used these for about 2 weeks now and we hate them. They can't cut raw meat worth anything. The only thing they're good for is cutting fruits (maybe that's what the blade is designed for). We will be investing in a better blade for sure.
4,Good buy.,"Got this knives, they are lighter than I would expect, but very sharp and do the job.I would recommend them."
5,Love these knives!,Finally decided to update the knives in my kitchen. My daughter got a set as a gift and after I used them I had to have a set of my own. Time to toss all the old knives out.
1,PRODUCT NOT AS SHOWN,"I ordered this calendar twice (the second time because I thought what they sent me the first time was a mistake, but they re-sent the same item) and both times they sent me ""A Fun Organizer for a CHRISTIAN FAMILY's Busy World"". The product is identical to that shown, except that it has a psalm quoted on the front of the pocket and about a quarter of the stickers are church-related. It's a really cute and useful calendar, but if you don't want a religious calendar I wouldn't order it."
1,Pretty dissapointed,"Purchased the PNY DVI-Y(DMS59) cables because of the name brand and also the photos made them look pretty solid. The last company I bought adapters from were poorly made and damaged some of my video cards. Upon receiving these adapters I noticed there were 3 different types in box and I only ordered 5 total. Some looked used. The 3 styles were different in color, length, and material. Some were extremely low quality. Sending them all back."
5,zenith mark 2,"We were ready to move our ten year old big screen , which still works just fine but is obviously missing a lot of the improvements of newer tvs , to our basement. Our old brand was a Zenith so we decided to go with them again since we had such good luck with the old one. I was afraid we would be disappointed but we absolutely love this tv. Not only does it have all the improvements that we were missing, but for the price the picture is fantastic and since we are setting it on a raised hearth the depth of less that 18"" is just fine. After looking at the more expensive really flat panels and deciding to hold off a while, we happened across this tv and have no regrets."
2,"Not bad, not good","I had high hopes for this set but in the end I think Swing the Handle suffers from overproduction. Merrins is a good teacher. His concepts are simply explained and the delivery is clear. However I kept wishing for more details. Merrins spends a great deal of time going over a few basic concepts, which is probably perfect for an in person lesson, but in a DVD I want lots of useful information presented concisely which I can re-watch at my leisure. I think the absolute beginner will get the most from this set. The DVDs are studded with golf and non-golf celebrities, but for the most part, they're just eye candy, providing a willing student for Merrins. If they're going to have PGA pros appear, they should provide some of their own tips and tricks instead of just being a foil for Merrins. In the end there is so much fat to get through to reach the real meat I just didn't feel like I learned anything useful."
5,VERY COOL HOME FOR THE BRATZ,THIS IS GREAT! FINALLY....A HOME FOR THE BRATZ! I AM SOO GLAD THAT THEY CAME UP WITH THIS!!! OR ELSE THE BRATZ WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN OLD BARBIE HOUSE OF MINE BECAUSE MY HAPPY FAMILY HOME IS ALREADY OCCUPIED BY MIDGE AND ALAN AND NIKKI AND RYAN AND BABY!***** FIVE STARS FOR FUN! BRATZ UR NUMBA ONE!THANX
5,Lighten Up!,"Absolutely the funniest Christmas album ever. Guaranteed to leave you in tears while driving ""squares"" crazy!"
3,Trendy!!!,"This album features Christmas songs played on, yes, rubber bands. It is fairly amusing, but potentially this kind of thing could get old really fast. Fortunately, the songs are kept short and the whole album is only 23 minutes long. There is an unlisted bonus track at the end, which is ""Carol of the Bells"" played on what sounds like combs."
1,Ummmm........Okay.,"This is a...um, interesting idea, but would you really waste money to buy a CD of songs being played on rubberbands?"
1,Pieces needed!!,"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I would have to agree with most of the other reviews (too bad I didn't read them before purchasing). The book says ""from bricks you have at home"". I do not have these bricks, nor does the book or the Lego website tell you which sets these ""odd bricks"" come from so that I can buy them. I'm not about to buy EVERY Lego set available on the hopes of getting the pieces we need. I will keep looking for where to find these pieces, but it was probably a waste of my money to buy the book."
4,yummy,"If you like Indian Cooking, this book provides Major Yum.However, it is impossible to find a recipe in the bookwhich does NOT have at least one tablespoon of oil or Ghee.It includes recipes for Naan, Paratha, Tandoori Chicken anda number of other regional favorites. As well as background."
3,Not really Indian food,"This book contains recipes for nothing but ""watered-down"" Indian food. Madhur has ""Americanized"" every dish, right down to the menu suggestions My question is why? Isn't this supposed to be an Indian cookbook? If you really want to eat REAL Indian food, I'd recommend buying a book by Shehzad Husain or Julie Sahni (author of Classical Indian Cooking, the best Indian cookbook out there!). Husain and Sahni don't water down their recipes, they add just as much spice as a cook in India would to their recipes, and the recipes are truly authentic.I must say, the recipes in Madhur's book are not atrocious, they all turn out quite tasty, and my ""American"" friends enjoy the food as well as my Indo-Pak friends. However, they don't taste ""Indian"", but rather like a hybrid of the two styles of cooking.I'm glad I only spent $... on this book. I saved the big bucks for Sahni and Husain's books."
2,DO NO PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hooked on Number Ones was not worth the money spent. Whoever the people were who singing or I should say were trying to sing like the originals were horrible.
4,Good used book,Satisfied with the buy.. No surprises and the book looked in good condition when received....
1,Great but out of date!,"The idea of this product is great. It clearly & easily presents a large amount of information about the Prince 2 method, and should be a great reference for those looking to take the Practitioners exam. Note however, the word should ... unfortunately on receiving the item I discovered that it is in fact out of date, as it does not reflect the changes to the Method as released in the 2005 edition.. and as it is this latest version of the method that candidates for the exam are now being tested on ... well, you get the picture!"
3,?,"this book will only make people like you because you are pretending to be like them in all ways, this is not impressive i thought everyone knew that, dont make friends with people who are unlike you using this method or once you let ur true colors out they will realize u were just saying what they wanted to hearim really surprised u needed a book to tell you that ""you are who you surround yourself with"""
5,We Only Have One First Impression,"We meet people every day in our lives, at work and outside of work. What if you could make such a first impression that they never forgot your name. This book can show you how to do that, what really goes on in someones mind. And how to use it in our benefit. The first minute and a half are the most important in any meeting, make it your best by learning and applying what this book talks about. And you will walk away every single time a winner.Armen TatiyantsAuthor,The Power of Leadership ""Becoming The Leader Others Will Follow"""
3,It was ok,"I didn't get that much out of the book. It was ok, but didn't convey what I thought it would. Pretty generic."
5,Good book,"It is a really good book, I enjoy it. If you looking for a book, You can choose this one, it's pretty good."
3,Good but goes overboard on NLP,"This book is definitly worth reading but, if you are familiar with neuro linguistic programming, you won't learn anything new. However you will get some insights on how to put it to use when you're with groups of people."
2,"Works, but doesn't last","First off the sponge is only attached at the base of blade (not the tip, the other end) which leaves the rest of the blade and sponge open for gravel to get in. After a few months, the sponge got lose and was not as effective, causing me to push harder and only in an up and down motion. Finally, after another month or 2, the handle simply broke."
1,What happened on this album??,"I loved ""Car Wheels"" more than any CD I can think of in recent memory. I bought ""WWT"" as soon as I saw it. I took it home and played it immediately with great anticipation. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD. I have tried several times to listen to this CD and get the same reaction everytime. With the exception of one or two songs I simply detest it. I do not understand the rave reviews and Grammy nominations. The songs are not nearly as strong as ""Car Wheels"" and the production is simply a disaster. I particulary hate the really cheesy guitar parts-the guitar parts on ""Car Wheels"" provided the hooks that really made the songs. Don't get this record it stinks."
4,RAWWWW,"Lu's new disc, cut live in the studio, is a beauty of raw, soul-bearing songs that digs deep into a relationship gone wrong! The more you listen, the more subtleties you discover...Do not pass up ""World w/o Tears""...you'd be missing out on a ragged beauty of song."
4,Great bluesy sound,This is an older recording and I was glad to find it. I enjoy her sound.and would buy it again. I have bought other cd's of hers but this one I like the best.
4,A Very Good Record,"World Without Tears is a very good Lucinda Williams record and is a worthy purchase for true Lucinda Williams fans. It's not as stellar as ""Car Wheels"" or her self-titled album - those albums were absolutely remarkable records - but this release is still very good and gets better with each listen. I love records like that.To those who have complained that the music on this record is too dark and melancholy, I don't understand. That's precisely what Lucinda Williams music is all about. It's what distinguishes Lucinda Williams from the others. She has the courage and an uncanny ability to write touching songs about themes that most other songwriters wouldn't dare touch. Her music touches the soul.Lucinda Williams is a gigantic talent and this record reaffirms the depth and breadth of her talent."
5,Transcendent and Astonishing,"If an artist is someone who takes chances in their work, then Lucinda Williams is one, and a great one too. This recording is unsettling and unflinching; if Williams was a painter, she'd be Goya. Three songs --""Ventura,"" ""Those Three Days"" and ""Minneapolis""--are the kind of songs that you hit the replay button on again and again. I've long been a fan of Lucinda Williams, but this record moves me into some other kind of category--devotee, perhaps, or committed admirer."
2,It's okay...,"Every song, as advertised, is in the key of C. That in itself is not so bad, but even so, there are a lot of songs beyond the average amateur musician.The book is just okay, like a lot of others. There are still a lot of filler songs that no one would ever play, but I guess that is to be expected.Learn as many chords as you can and forget the melody lines till you do. Once you've got the chords down pat, you probably won't really need this book or dozens more like it.I'm still waiting on the perfect book for those who want to make a fair effort at actually playing the piano. This one, while ""okay"" still just isn't quite it."
5,"very esoteric, gorgeously writen","Jeff Green, true to his writing style, conveys information in a very esoteric, soul- driven manner. If you are more spiritually inclined, this is a great book for exploring the meaning of Pluto and its indications for past and future lives, facilitating your own evolution, and a foundational text in the exploration of evolutionary astrology. His writing style does get very ethereal in moments, so some passages require the reader to stop and contemplate so that the full impact can be felt. not really an easy read, but so deep and profound that the effort is worthwhile, especially for those with a lot of Pluto action in their charts or experiencing a Pluto transit."
2,Disappointed,I was looking for a more in depth book on Pluto. Though it was general it did offer basic information for the new explorer. I just needed something more elaborate and as deep as the planet itself.
5,The best how-to guide for canoe camping/tripping,"This is the best how-to guide to canoe camping/tripping--period. Ms. Bell covers the gambut of canoe camping, from planning, equipment selection, considerations concerning traveling with children, health & safety issues, and on and on. It exhaustively covers every imaginable topic, and should answer any question any potential canoe tripper might have. We've been canoe tripping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for several years, and Roughing it Elegantly is our how-to guide book. Even veterans will find it useful."
4,Great,It is easy to use and detailed. I would have liked if it would have came with a few more conversational vocabulary words to make it excellent.
3,mkraze,this is a well made product with many features.the only downside i have experienced is the batter life.
1,MOTOROLA,If this is a great camera phone how come not one picture is posted from this phone ? also nobody is talking about phone reception quality or anything must be junk I gave it one star because it looks good and every review is lame and im not sure if i want to own it without knowing
2,Not the best Alexander book out there,"I have read several Victoria Alexander books and I have to say that this one was just not that great. While it did make me laugh out loud a few times, Reggie, the main male character, was less than inspiring. I found him to be wishy-washy and weaker than most of Alexander's characters usually are. He seems to have way too much dialog examining the fact that he has been in love more times than he can count but how this time is different. But he can never actually say why this time is different and I guess I never believed him or really cared for that matter. In fact, some of the supporting characters seemed much more interesting than Reggie and I was hoping Cassandra would fall for one of those people instead.All in all I like Alexander's books but this is not one of her best. I would recommend the Prince's Bride or When We Meet Again instead of this one."
4,i love that iit keeps the food clean but it gets stuck,i love that it keeps all the food clean and only does a little at a time but i find my self having to flick it to get the food out becuase it will get stuck. but its still okay
4,Love it!,"I heard up the bracket about a month ago and listenin to them is a totally new sound. They are very good, but on a couple songs I felt I just had to skip over. But songs like up the bracket, horror show, and tell your king keep this a solid album. I would give it a 4.5 not a 4."
5,Up the Bracket forever!!!,"With ""Up the Bracket"" The Libertines have established themselves as England's top garage rock band, despite the band's near collapse due to singer Pete Doherty's recent prison stay and drug addiction. The albums features some of the rawest punk guitar riffs anywhere, as well as a plethora of irresistable hooks. Guitarists Pete Doherty and Carl Barat steal the show as they also share duty on vocals. ""Vertigo"" is a fine opener. It grabs your attention with a catchy chorus and some explosive guitar, which you'll find on most of the rest of the album as well. Carl Barat's vocal showcase is the frenzied third track ""Horrorshow"", where he let's his leering vocal style steer the band as if he were a drunk pirate captain. The best songs on the album are the anthemic ""Boys in the band"", and the incredibly tight title track. Both are showcases for the potential this dynamic quartet have if they could just survive each other. I for one hope they do."
2,Smells like something I've heard before,"The stokes, white stripes, etc. etc. Truly a overhyped band if there ever was one. Mine is already being used as a coaster. Seriously about two good songs and Mick Jones production is so so. Bands that used to sound like this in the early punk new wave days had no choice,because a lot of the stuff was truly ameture. Now its cool to sound like you don't know what you;re doing. I don't buy it.(well i did, but no more!"
2,"""Where's My Pillow??""..or ""Happy Again? NO!""","Don't believe the hype. You've heard this before. About as good as two day old bread. Mick Jones production doesn't help this stand out from anything else in music today or yesterday. This CD's progressive slide of songs gets boring before you can get hooked. If you purchase this disc, you'll be trying to sell back to a used CD store by summers start."
1,what is this?,"right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshambles"
4,"Only the 3rd ""garage rock"" album worth listening to","What this whole ""THE band"" movement is seriously lacking is melody.""That's the whole point,"" you might say.But I don't think music should lack melody.That's the point of music.And the Libertines have it in spades.I can't put my finger on it, but these melodies are amazing--they're somewhere between Lawrence Welk, The Clash, and some Vaudville guy with a cane.And they yell sometimes too.Incredible songs that are always one step ahead of your ears. One big ball of fun.It sure is better than ""Elephant"""
3,"Eh. Hard to get used to and very ""un-ergonomic"".","I sometimes rather use the soft-keyboard that is built in, since that annoying screen protector is always in the way. Also the keyboard has shown me no glitches, but it is very hard to use especially in the dark [since it has no backlight].I keep it on at all times, just in case... I recommend it for those who do A LOT of typing on the go.Also it is possible to use the Targus [Stowaway] keyboard with it, you just have to make sure that the other device is disabled when using the current typing device respectively."
5,Fantastico!!!,"While it could be a little bigger, this book exactly what I was looking for. Nintey six pages filled with gorgeous photos of samurai and other troops from the various martial eras of Japanese history. Appearently like our Civil War reenacters the Japanese like to ""hang out"" and dress up all anachronistic. Which is just fine because this is the only book I've ever seen of actual people donning ""tosei gusoku,"" an' taking action in them. If you are an illustrator or just a fan of samurai this book IS FOR YOU!!!"
2,Its a good investment but...,"Purchased one two years ago and it didn't take me long to realize that it is too bulky to be stored anywhere handy. Not everyone has a spare corner in the house for a 3 gal bucket to stand ready to be grabbed. I ended up buying two more kits directly from [...]. Their kits come in a handy backpack which you can either have in the trunk of your car or just hang inside your closet. ""Grab-and-go"" as they call it, is a great feature. Their price seems to be right too!"
1,Sickening Photos of Deceased,"I first read this book at the Virgin Records Megastore in Orlando. My reaction? It made me so entirely sick, I wanted to throw up. The photos in this book are horrid, sickening, and utterly disgusting. This is something you'd never imagine happening in the early motoring era, and what makes the photos worse, they're all black & white toned. If blood makes you sick, stay away from this book."
4,Sitting without the robes,"Other reviews of this book have mentioned Clark Strand's wonderful, straightforward style and the simplicity with which he encourages the reader to pursue a daily meditation practice without expectations or self-criticism.The book's greatest gift is the author's recollection of the Chinese recluse Tsa Chung (or ""De Chun""), a Buddhist monk who drifted across the waters and made his home in a hut in Tennessee in the sixties. He lived a very simple life and taught only indirectly, by eating when he ate and wasting nothing (he would even save little pieces of foil, folding them up very neatly and putting them away). The author's often hilarious anecdotes about this man point us directly to the meat of our practice, letting the air out of spiritual pretension and connecting very simply and sweetly to our life just now."
4,THE MOVIE'S PATHETIC BUT THE BOOK IS GOOD,"The only thing the movie is good for is for you to laugh at it. In comparison the book is absolutely fantastic but when compared with other Clancys it comes down a few notches. Don't get me wrong, I thought the book was very good and I especially loved the development of the character John Clark but it doesn't quite live up to the expectations that Clancy set for himself in Patriot Games and The Cardinal of the Kremlin. (Is it just me or is anyone else starting to think that Jack Ryan is an oversized boyscout?). Still it's a must read in the Ryan saga."
5,Once of Clancy's finest Works!,"This is an incredible book. Mr. Clancy has managed to weave an extremely complex story of drugs, betrayal, murder, honor and ultimately justice. Woven throughout this book's pages are many great moral values, creating a truly positive reading experience.QUICK NOTEThis book has high levels of violence (hey it's a military novel) and not a little swearing. (Comprable every two hours of reading to a rated R war film."
2,Clear and Presblah blah blah -- just don't read it,"While there are a few compelling elements and episodes in this book, they are overshadowed and weighed down so heavily by tedious tangents into government machinations, legality of government actions, and military equipment/maneuvers that interest is quickly lost. People have said that the books are always better than the movies; in this case the movie-makers salvaged an awesome movie from boring source material."
3,"Strong page-turner, but could be smoother","I will not be the first to note that Clancy loves technical gadgets too much.I also find that sometimes sub-plot lines take too many pages to explore, I tried omitting the especially dull ones, and guess what - you still follow the plot perfectly, and the suspense does not suffer.Generally, a very strong book. You could do much worse at an airport bookshop."
5,WOW....Be Blown Away,I was an avid SF reader untill I read Clear and Present Danger. This was my first Clancy book and I plan on reading them all now. I wasn't able to put this book down it just kept me so caught up in the story I kept reading untill I was done. If you want to be blown away read this book!
4,NICE SPRAYER,DOES A NICE JOB ON THE SIMPLE PROJECTS AND CLEANS UP EASY . WOULD NOT USE ON SAY A AUTO PAINT JOB BECAUSE THE PAINT FLOW IS VERY HARD TO KEEP BALANCED . MUST BE A NEEDLE CONTROL PROBLEM . BUT WORKS WELL ON LAWN EQUIPMENT AND OTHER TYPES OF BASIC OBJECTS . OVERALL IT IS WORTH THE PRICE .
3,"Missing Parts, could not be used","Timely received ths sprayer and, when the weekend arrived, I had a project ready for its use. However, when attempting to assemble the sprayer, it turns out the parts bag that was included contained the wrong parts (apparently meant for another model). Thus, the sprayer could not be used. I have initiated the process for returning the sprayer to Amazon to exchange for another which I hope will have the correct parts. There was no means that I could find on the Amazon website for simply getting the correct parts without returning the entire sprayer, and there is no website for Tool Force in the materials that came with the sprayer or on the Amazon website that I could find. My project remains on hold and, since I was unable to use the sprayer, cannot comment on is merits or lack thereof."
3,"Spanner is Junk, Spray Gun OK","The spanner included with the spray gun is a piece of ****. I needed to use the 2.0 nozzle for latex paint, which meant I had to remove the pre-attached nozzle. Unfortunately, the spanner is too big for the nozzle, so it just ends up slipping and stripping things and causing general feelings of rage. After working it for maybe an hour, I was able to chisel enough of the nozzle to get a grip with some other tools and pry it free. A complete waste of time that I would gladly have paid more to avoid. That being said, after finally getting it working, the spray gun has worked decently."
5,My Favorite CD,I feel like I am enjoying a live performance of the London Philharmonic and the singing is extraordinary! This truly is my favorite CD. It plays in my preferred group every day and I never tire of it! I have given it to 2 friends for their Birthday gifts and they each love it as well! I will probably order another one so I can have it at home and in the car - that is how much I enjoy it!
5,Exceptional CD,"After listening to the music, the songs are very inspirational, and soothing to the soul."
3,Grandiose,"This is a nice collection of hymns, but done in a theatrical style, connecting groups of hymns without singing all of the verses (or at least the most familiar) verses. If you like splashy, stirring, hollywood renditions of hymns, you'll like this. If you don't like that sort of thing, you won't like it. I am planning to give my set to a family member who will appreciate it."
1,Very Noisy,"Loud rhythmic buzzing under a 400 watt max load. Item returned. Can anyone recommend a decent transformer, this is my 3rd go?"
5,It works well,"I bought it to run my high pressure cooker one month ago. So far, I'm very satisfied with it. No noise, no smell, it's good!"
1,do not order,absolutely no thought went into writing this book. I would send it back but anticipatethat the postage would cost as much as the book. I bought this book for a 3 yearold who loves kitties---will probably give it to the Goodwill instead.
2,I Don't Get It (And I'm Allergic to Cats),"Other reviewers have criticized this book as overly simplistic, even for very young children.The entire book makes use of but nine monosyllabic words. They are as follows:1. My2. You3. This4. Have5. Cat6. Seen7. Is8. Not9. WhereThis meager vocabulary is sufficient to convey the plot - a boy's worldwide quest for a missing kitty. The action is fleshed out by the author's arty and engaging illustrations.My problem with the book is not its repetitious simplicity. Rather it's the opposite; the complex and obscure nature of its ending. In the end the cat is found and the boy exclaims, ""This is my cat!""But what the reader sees is not one but a total of seven cats.Which one is it? Or is it all of them, in some mysterious expression of many facetted feline fascination?Or did the cat have kittens while its owner was away?Who knows?Who cares?"
5,Avation's Role in Shaping American History,"First World Flight tells the tale of Billy Mitchell, aviation pioneer and military hero who orchestrates the first flight around the world to promote the role of aviation in the United States. Author Spencer Lane steps into the shoes of the brave pilots who persevered to make the dream of flight a reality. Aviation, history, and war buffs will particularly enjoy this story of bravery, dedication and the will to succeed."
4,"Good, FOUND INSTRUCTIONS!!!","Overall this cage is sturdy and is not black, more of a rusty gray. The assembly took me about 2 hours because there are NO directions... It was pretty time consuming and required patience. I amd using it for two cockatiels and so far seems roomy enough for them to fly in. I think I got a different cage than the picture because mine doesn't have the swirls at the top, and surprisingly, they sent me steel bowls instead of plastic ones which I was happy about. The cage is bigger and heavier than it looks, and for this price, it's a great deal.EDIT: I found the instructions! They weren't in the box, so I assembled it without them. When I went to throw the box away, I figured I would save the front label on the box. When I peeled it off, the instructions were taped with it! Of course I was too late but for those of you who don't get how to assemble it, this'll help!"
3,travel cage,"The cage is perfect for a short stay.I have an Amazon parrot and it was too small of a cage to keep her in for long. The wires on the cage are also a little plyable,so you cannot attach anything heavy.Alot of shortcuts in workmanship,but I guess for $80 it still was a decent buy"
4,Alien seeks refuge from info-industrial complex.,"Poor Tedla. A ""bland"" it may be, but it's story is a rich broth of xeno-ethnology and perfectly non-Freudian psychology. All those well-meaning people telling it that it's 'problem' can be fixed. Why? It doesn't have a problem.But, it's advisors all seem to have problems and they all find Tedla to be the genetalia rasa to work them out on."
1,Not good. Not good at all.,"Not sure what I expected but I thought it was at least a little sci-fi. I kept waiting for the point. The character was describing it's childhood and I found myself just skipping whole sections. I wanted to see what it was leading up to what kind of plot it had, but it did not have any plot or point. I have a rule not to buy any book which has more than 10% of 1 and 2 stars combined and that was this book. I guess I have to revise my criteria. The good thing is Amazon refunded my money. Which is nice of them. I can't really recommend this to anyone because I don't know what kind of people would like it. Sorry."
3,Cute Romantic Story,This was a cute contemporary romantic story. Katarina just got out of a relationship with a cheating ex-fiance and Cole had abandonment fears. Both characters had trust issues to overcome in order to move forward with their relationship.
3,A good love story with unneeded explicit sex scenes,"A good love story but with much sexual explicitnessI was well-written but quite drawn out. It would havebeen better without the indulging sex scenes that added nothing to the story.""Rina had several issues from a dysfunctional childhood.After a miserable engagement for years with an ungrateful, displeased lover ,she discovered his unfaithfulness and decided to create a new life for herself.In her attempt to become a new person she went to a ""powwow'and discovered an intriguing warrior who immediately was attracted to her as well.She was mesmerized by him and followed him to his performance then to his teepeeafterwards. from there is escalates. Although he seem confident an arrogant , he hasserious abandonment issues which has kept him from the female population exceptfor brief flirtations...untill ""Rina"" came along. Their relationship was powerful, thennon-existent, then stormy. How would it end?"
5,Pretty amazing!!!,"Brent Jones and the TP Mobb have released an album that is really great. A lot of traditional gospel listeners may not like the way it sounds, but it sounds great to me. I never have a problem with the way music sounds. As Christians we should not be a microcosm of the culture, we should be leading it. With this effort, I think they even surpass a lot of the secular out there. With songs like ""Closer"" and ""When I see you"", you'll know that you're not listening to R & B. The lyrics are obviously praising and glorifying Christ. However, I do have a problem with them referring to God as ""Daddy"" on their songs. Never in scripture is God referred to as ""Daddy"". Only our earthly fathers should be referred to as such. Other than that, I think the CD is awesome! It will definitely turn some heads!"
4,A Beautiful Experience,"Without a doubt, Brent and the Mobb has captured the essence of their CD title. The Cd is beautiful in spirit, melody and laced with a beautiful array of R&B tracks that I can rock in my ride.I caught their concert in LA on Sunday and after hearing the performance I had to get the CD. I only wish they could've done a couple of more uptempo tracks on the CD."
3,One grouchy heroine,"Well, I read and enjoyed this during my weekly commute to work on mass transit. I liked Nicholas and the whole idea of relating a romantic story of second chances to the central theme prominent in Dicken's Christmas Carol. I guess what disappointed me a bit was the character of Elizabeth Effington Langley. I found myself a bit perplexed at times while reading this because her whole demeanor seemed to be an irritable young woman who got angry rather quickly and did little more than arch an eyebrow on occasion in her conversational exchanges. I was hoping for more of a heroine, I guess. I suppose I wanted someone with more depth or maybe a cheerier disposition. That was the only thing that left me feeling a little disappointed with this book. Otherwise, nice, fun read!"
2,Hate to give a book only 2 stars,"This is my first book by this author. I am a sucker for Christmas themed stories, so decided to give it a try in spite of the lukewarm reviews. I should have gone with the reviews. It's not a really bad story, just a boring one. I never really got into the flow of the book. Maybe the story had no flow? I had high hopes for reading more about the Effington family, but now I don't think I'll bother. One thing that was quite interesting to me was that Lizzie's parents are the Duke and Duchess of Roxborough. I happen to live in Roxborough, CO. And I must say, there was some quiet witty dialogue here and there."
1,Buyer Beware,"I tried to save money with this remanufactured item instead of an original HP cartridge, however I don't recommend purchasing this item. It was a waste of money for me. The cartridge would not work in my printer (HP Deskjet 400), all the printer would do is try to index the cartridge then illuminate the malfunction light.The green top of the cartridge was crooked, half glued on and loose, it came off in my hand when I took it out of the package. This signaled poor quality to me before I even put it in the printer. It never would work for me."
2,BonJour Caffe Latte,"I really wanted this to work! I like the idea that it uses 4 AA batteries. It really does have lots of power. My complaints are that the nearly flat disc of the Caffe Latte does a really poor job frothing compared to the round spring type used on the Primo Latte. Also, I am spoiled by the push button on/off switch of the Primo Latte, rather than the need to hold the button down the entire time you are frothing with the Caffe Latte. I have been using the BonJour Primo Latte for about a year and it worked great, until the motor finally became very weak and would hardly turn the shaft. Thinking the Caffe Latte would offer better results, I tried it, but i was sorely disappointed in the product itself. I am ordering another Primo Latte frother."
4,Bonjour Cafe Latte,"The frother works great for making Greek Frappe Coffee. The blade is the best at whipping up the coffee. The only problem is the push button. It is too hard to push down, and you have to push it at the right spot. Otherwise, it goes too slowly."
3,Frothing works well but it has a design flaw,"Frothing: 5 StarsBUT: - 1 Star only for battery installation!Reason: the connection of the top part that covers the batteries is very weak. The Cap is under a lot of pressure from 4 springs that ensure that the batteries are connected well. - The little plastic knobs that are supposed to hold the cap in place have to snap in by twisting. They are actually not up to this task and the cap sometimes pops off, ejecting the batteries everywhere.This can be triggered when you touch it the wrong way or even by the vibration of the frothing action.You really have to handle this frother very carefully to enjoy the frothing but I fear that the little knobs will wear out quickly."
2,Bubble Trouble,The unit makes great froth BUT it takes four batteries and it is heavy and difficut to reassemble once the batteries are installed. It is also very difficut to push down and maintain the pressure on the frothing mechanism. I do not reccommend this product if you have arthritis in your hands or fingers.
1,Cap Will Not Stay On,"I returned this item twice for an exchange, both times for the exact sames reasons below. The first time I had problems, I thought I had gotten a bad unit. But the second unit had the same problems, which are:*The batteries are difficult to get in*The battery + and - labels are impossible to see on the black plastic*The cap is extremely difficult to get on after you have inserted batteries*The cap will not stay on the unit*If you knock the stand over (which is easy to do because it is top heavy), the cap pops off and will not go back on againI will be ordering a completely different model today without this design problem. Can't believe I missed the bad reviews before ordering this item. It would have saved me a lot of trouble."
1,It is time to give up on Bonjour,I had BonJour's basic frother which I liked a lot. One day it just died on me after only a few months of use. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and try another one of their products. I bought this new and improved version of their frother. It literally worked for 5 seconds. It started spinning and then just went dead. Can't bring it back to life. Two defective products in 2 weeks? That is just poor quality. I'll never buy anything from them again.
3,Bonjour frother,"This model of the Bonjour Frother operates as advertised. It's main advantage over other frothers at a similar price is that it uses four batteries instead of two and, therefore, should be more powerful and last longer than other models. However, the battery enclosure is poorly designed and comes apart too easily. I have had to use tape to keep it closed. Also, while the correct battery orientation is marked, the marks are very difficult to see."
2,BROKEN,"I'm pretty displeased with what I received. It was broken when it arrived, so I can't really use it. Originally, I thought it was just difficult to close the battery hatch, but the plastic was just broken. I'm disappointed; from what I can tell, it would have worked well otherwise."
1,Beware of Cheap Imitations,"A perusal of the song titles included on this disc lead you to believe that it is worthy collection. However, buyer beware: many of the tracks on this collection are not original recordings, but pathetic re-makes. Listening to the re-recroded version of Fox on the Run or Indiana Wants Me is beyond painful. While the actual disc does bear a small-print disclaimer indicating the tracks are re-recorded versions, there is no such warning included in the on-line album sales information. I feel totally ripped off by this purchase."
3,I Love Virtue. Great music,"Virtue is a nice group but my only concern is what happen to the girls negelle and shavonn? that new girl heather looks a bit like tyra banks don't you think? well i haven't heard how they sound with her yet but i'm sure they sound great. I like this group alot because their songs are so beautiful and uplifting and refreshing. unlike alot of groups that are no longer together these girls still are. to me, they are like the gospel version of destinys child. buy this cd. i know im going to!"
5,Better than 5 stars!!,"This book was made for the horse-lovers! I have recently read Heartland, Chestnut Hill, BLack Stallion, Saddle Club, and Pony Pals, and I really do think this is the best series out of those. I have only read the first book, but I already recommend the others because I know that if they are anything close to the first book, they will be AWESOME!! Terri Farley has a wonderful gift of writing, and I hope that I can write stories like her! I think lots of people would love this book, even if they aren't horse-lovers. But that is my opinion. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book!! The Wild One is one of the best books I have ever read! :-DLeah"
5,Great Shoe,"My son wears a 12 EE and has a thick in-step. He's 24 yrs. old and wears these with everything. This is his second pair of the Rockport Northfield Oxfords and he's very happy them. His first pair he wore the soles down to no tread. He's on his feet for long periods of time and says these are the most comfortable shoe he owns, even compared to his sneakers. It's hard to find a shoe that both fits him comfortably and suits his taste."
3,A bit painful,Shoes are a bit uncomfortable. The back of the shoe has absolutely NO padding. My ankles are worn to nubs as a result.
4,very good,"comfortable. i try to compare this shoe with my ecco and clarks, but i feel like they all fit me well. BTW, waterproof seems not to be very necessary in LA.HAHA"
3,Tough but hard,"These shoes look nice and seem to be very durable but the sides are a little too stiff, I hope that once I break them in they will be more comfortable."
5,Rockport Northfield Oxford,"This is my second pair! My order arrived quickly. They are very comfortable and supportive, and they make an excellent business casual choice."
4,A recieved the product in the right time and in perfect conditions. Thank you very much.,"I choose this rate because i like the shoes. One thing that I didn't like, was the front of the shoes that is too round. In the picture it looked different."
5,Great Shoes for Portland Oregon,I have been using these Northfield shoes for several years and can purchase narrow ones only on line today. Thanks.
4,good shoe..,These shoes are a comfortable fit. great for all seasons. especially when it is wet (rain or snow)...would purchase again
3,Comfortable but dent easily,These shoes are comfortable and fit well to size. But a significant drawback is that the toe box dents and creases easily. It seems to be made with a thin material that's not stiff enough to resist dents/creases and not flexible enough to avoid having these creases stay in the shoe.
4,Getting this-for this price-changed my life,"I've had this phone, which stopped working, for about 2 years now sitting in a drawer. I figured it MIGHT be the battery, but the local cell phone company (Alltel-since gone out of business) wouldn't even test it-but they WOULD sell me a new battery for $45, and specifically told me, if the problem wasn't the battery-and it might not be-I was out of luck, no return, no refund. So, instead, I got a cheapy no feature one from them, just because I have a good plan that I got before they went nuts on the price of their plans prior to going under. When I saw this price, I figured, hey, what the heck-spending $7 and getting screwed was a LOT better than spending $50 and getting screwed, so I gave it a chance. You gussed it-it was the battery, and now it works perfectly. YIPEE!"
2,Wait until RANSOM comes out in Paperback!,"I read this author's books as soon as they are published; normally I preorder her books. This book, although good; it was not worth preordering; wait until it comes out in paperback.This is very different; much like ""The Klone and I"". I would not recommend this book if you are wanting a good love story as Mrs. Steel is so famous for writing! Get this ONLY if you want a good suspenseful book to read.Maybe her next will be better!"
4,Not her best by far,"While I did enjoy ""Ransom"", I didn't feel that this was one of DS best books. I was happy to see that it wasn't the same old, same old as some of her previous books. I did not, however, like the mystery aspect of the book. I found the middle of the book to be dull and found myself skipping whole paragraphs at times. Mystery/thriller novels are not DS style. I did enjoy Ted and Fernanda's exchanges throughout the book, and Sam was my favorite character."
3,SHOULD NOT BE IN THE TOP 10,"HELLO, I HAVE JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK. THE BEGINING IS GOOD BUT THEN THE ENDING DRAGS ON AND TURNS INTO HAPPILY EVER AFTER. SHORT AND SWEET NOT WORTH READING."
3,NOT TOO BAD.,"Lately I've found Danielle Steele's books to be a bit boring. Ransom wasn't too bad. It a totally different storyline than her other books which is probably why I bothered to finish it. But, I would wait until this book comes out in paperback or go to the library and take it out. It's not worth to spend the price of a hardback on it."
1,Not so hot...sorry,"Very confusing book, and shy on details. Also contains to much personal interjection (opinions). A better book I would recommend is 'A Buddhism Primer - And Introduction to Buddhism'."
4,Awesome floorwork!,"The first part of this tape is an aerobics routine that can be done either with or without a step and either non-impact or mixed impact. The step is used minimally; I wouldn't call this a ""real"" step routine. It's a fun routine that gives you a good workout (at the Beginner level without the step and possibly Intermediate level with the step). I downgraded this routine from 5 to 4 stars only because the aerobic portion of the routine is too short - only 21 or 27 minutes, depending on how you count the last section of standing leg work. The second part of this tape is the real reason to buy it! It contains the most awesome floor routine for the lower body that I've found so far. It's very concentrated and just plain difficult to do! I expect that a Beginner would tend to give up in frustration, an Intermediate would find it just enough of a challenge, and an Advanced would need to add ankle weights. Whatever your level, this is a great lower body floor routine!"
3,A Little Disappointed,Great literature on the history of dance. Great word discriptions on the steps but no foot pattern diagrams. The enclosed DVD is Couples Ultimate Dance Sampler which I already own. The DVD's are very good. All of the dances covered in the book are in one or the other of their several DVD's. If you have the DVD's you don't need the book
4,Re-read,I re-purchased this book after I couldn't find my original. I never played Werewolf: The Apocalypse or Vampire: the Masquerade Though I think the premise is clever. Usually I find books based on them to be campy and bogged down with game related terminology. However these stories were are really pretty clever and I enjoy picking it up from time to time. Highly recommended for anyone into World of Darkness.
2,suspicious,"My chief complaint about this crib is that the latch can easily be opened from the inside by curious and enterprising fingers.And though it is of sturdy make, I really wonder if my son's got enough room in there."
1,A book where research of companies is at a minimum,"I received this book for Christmas and just spent ten minutes laughing at the history of Xerox. The authors called the company's beginnings as the Harold company, then changed its name to the Harold Xerox Company. The original company's name was the Haloid Company, not the Harold Company. In my ten minutes of reading there was 4 more errors of company names or historical facts of the stock certificates. I did not read the ""history"" portion but feel if the authors can't get the histories of Xerox, Exxon, Playboy, Admiral, etc correct, why bother....The stock certificates are admirable, though"
4,stock certificates as art,"This book has brought me years of enjoyment; who knew you could learn so much from a stock certificate?? Now that a bank or brokerage holds these most times, we don't often see the detail and art on an issued stock certificate, and that's too bad. A great coffee table book."
3,slides,"i was happy enough when i first got this thermometer. i liked that it hangs over the side. however, after a while the glass tube began to slide down and since the makings are on the metal bracket it's difficult to know what exactly the temperature is suppose to be. why not a huge deal i am wishing i would have shelled out a little more for a different thermometer."
3,Strange read,"This is one of the most obsurd Sherlock Holmes Parodies I've ever read. The characters aren't even living! I have to admit though, that since it is so ridiculous- it's absolutely hilarious! This book is worth a read when you have nothing else on hand."
3,"movie's good, the dvd has a manufacturing glitch","Great to see this movie on dvd, however in at least 2 spots when selecting the english language version, it switches to german with english subtitles. One lasts about a minute, the 2nd spot lasts about 5-6 minutes. Not sure why this is and the seller has never seen this. Apparently the manufacturer had trouble with the english track and had to revert to german in a couple spots. If you don't mind that, then go for it. First time I've seen this movie since it originally aired on tv. I remember how emotional it was to see the students shot down in cold blood and the hatred I felt towards the military when watching it. Very moving."
5,You don't need to smoke anything to enjoy this album!,"The music is so surreal it takes you from one mental trip to the next. It makes you see bunnies, colors, and falling rose petals. Makes you feel like you are making endless love to a harem of beautiful women on puffy clouds. Her voice is enchanting it captures you under her spell. You happily surrender to her while she makes you explore the depths of your inner consciousness. Give up your whacky therapist and give in to the Thievary Corporation."
4,"Can I say they're ""Cool""?","Wow! Ya'know, I hear a disc like this andask myself ""where the *bleep-bleep* have I been?!"" - its2004 and I'm just hearing of the Thievery Corp! Allis not lost however: let this baby spin a few times and thenewbie's ears will find a new best friend in the Corp.Your speakers will ripple many dispinsations of 'coolness'from these talented chill-out meisters. And thoughI'm just now hearing them, I'm glad - there is allthe more to explore."
3,Laid-back pleasure,"After buying Richest Man in Babylon, I was craving more Thievery Corp. This CD is not another Richest Man in Babylon, though. It is much more downtempo and smooth. The first couple of tracks are excellent, with several tracks at the end being quite good as well. On the other hand, the majority of the middle and end tracks are relatively monotonous and not memorable. If you are looking for something that is more relaxing and quieting, then this is your ticket, but if you want something to captivate and groove you, then I might suggest something else."
2,I don't get it!,"Gee...really nice album cover. I wish the music was as good. I just don't get it. I think this is marginal at best. I love down tempo electronica but I think this is dull and uninspiring...ugly at times. If you want some good down tempo stuff, try The Starseeds or Ambient Dub Vol. Two! I know that others may love this material...but I don't!"
2,Not His Best By A Long Shot,"As a big Al Stewart fan I must say that ""The Last Days of the Century"" isn't up to his usual standards. Many of the songs seem a little half baked in the writing department, and a little over done in the production department. Melodies that don't hold attention for very long, and lyrics that seem awkward and forced are overcompensated for with lots of synthesizers and overly busy arrangements that seem to be designed to distract attention from the shortcomings the songs themselves tend to have.Not that things are a total loss. ""King of Portugal,"" while a tad on the overproduced side, is melodically memorable, ""Red Toupee"" is lots of fun, and ""Where Are They Now"" keeps things simple in the instrumentation department to reveal a song that bears repeated listening. But little else here can measure up to the best of Stewart's work."
4,Grandmothers Book,"I bought this book as a gift for my supervisor at work, who is about to be a grandmother for the first time. She absolutely loved it. Its sentimental and sweet and funny all at the same time. I am pleased with the purchase."
4,Excellent performance but the sound could be better,"I agree with one reviewer that the sound quality of this DVD, though very good, is a little limited in dynamic range. While the high notes are clear, the low notes are a little lacking in comparison with modern-day CD or DVD-Audio recordings, which are able to capture the dynamics of pianos that the listener can ""feel"". But all this comment about the audio quality should not (cannot) overshadow an excellent live performance by Lang Lang; particularly the Appassionata sonata, in which Lang Lang's artistry reminds me of great recordings by Gilels and Pollini. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
5,Lang Lang Impressive!!,"I've watched it at least 10 times. Definitely one of the best concert DVDs in my collection.The incredible part is that he played pieces from 4 composers of different eras and completely different music style.And he plays all of them extremely well - full of energy and passion, besides technically brilliant.Audiences in Vienna obviously agree, as he drove them to their feet many times.2 hours of note-perfection playing with style is indeed impressive!"
5,"This is available on DVD, but...","If you buy the VHS version you may risk wearing it out. The answer is to get the DVD version. But, for Region One and NTSC this seems to be the impossible dream. However, you will find a few copies of the DVD at Amazon.co.uk - as a Region TWO, PAL-encoded disk. For viewers in NTSC territory (e.g. USA), viewing the disk is a nightmare unless you are into all the technical issues, or purchase a region-free (or multi-region) DVD player that will convert PAL to NTSC. I've had good luck with the Philips players. I haven't tried a Sony player, but it seems that some of their players play multi-regions, but in any case require an external converter to turn a PAL signal into NTSC.Many PAL TV sets will display an NTSC signal, but few if any NTSC sets will display a PAL-encoded signal, so be warned if you don't elect to get the right player. Fortunately, the Philips multi-region, converting, players are not very expensive."
5,Good Clean Fun!,"What a clever bath time book! Start counting from one end reading catchy rhyming text about ten pigs who bathe until they ""aren't dirty anymore."" Then FLIP THE BOOK OVER and watch those same pigs get dirty all over again! My daughter was fascinating with the flip part. I liked the illustrations. Definitely worth a look."
2,Highly impractical -- should be easier to reference quickly,"The dressings in this book might be just fine, but it's lacking in features that would make the book more easily usable. For one, it doesn't have a table of contents. The only semblance of organization is that there are three sections: creamy-style, vinaigrettes and fat-free. Within each of those sections, the dressings are in no apparent order, not even alphabetical. In the absence of a table of contents, I don't know how the reader is supposed to be able to quickly look up a dressing. For me, that was the whole point in buying a book like this -- I wanted a quick reference. The dressing recipes seem okay, although it's disappointing that a dressing called Creamy Feta Dressing doesn't list feta cheese as an ingredient. In the serving suggestions on the page for this dressing, the last few words read ""additional crumbled feta cheese,"" to which I ask ""In addition to what?"" I'll keep looking for a better little salad dressing reference."
1,indignation,"I didn""t recieved this film. I have already write about to amazone and to the shop who sell it. This is my opinion. Is good for you? Is good for amazone? You have nothing to do whith that? An so am i. I""ve never had any problems....until now.Thanks,Rodrigo Patacki Nobre"
4,Great Book!,"The book describes the city, her quarters, habitants, history, gods, dangers and ""stars"" in a soberb way. The adventure with happens in a market chash is very good too. The ONLY drawback of the book in my oppinion are the pictures who are inferior to Warhammer FRP standards. Anyway the book surely worth the price."
4,American Music...Live!,"The Violent Femmes keep getting better and better over time. Their commitment to touring is to be admired and younger musicians should look to the Femmes as role models. Now we have a well-made testament to this band's live shows which captures their energy and musicianship. If you don't get the chance to see the Femmes live, this CD will fill the gap. For those of us who see them every chance we get, this CD will tide us over in between shows! I gave a four star rating only because this CD makes me miss them all the more..."
1,Too many mistakes,This book has an extraordinary number of errors. The synthesis of methamphetamine (scourge of the west) is described according to a method used by bikers in the seventies. Rape is defined as forcible sex between a man and a woman. One of the causes of violence is a high sugar diet. Feminism can lead to violence. Descriptions of criminal law are weak and full of errors. This is a bad book.
4,Pro: It's cheap; Con: It's cheap (see revised review),"Well, you get what you pay for. This item is has such a cheap look and feel that you wouldn't be surprised if it came free with a pie costing about $10.00. The good news is it's so cheap in $$$ that I can throw it out and order theRosle VS 600 Pie Serveror theNorpro Pie ServerI should have bought in the first place.7/19/10: Now that I've used this for a while, I think my review is too harsh. It is very well balanced and does the job. I've added two stars."
3,"decent introduction, but needs more","In an introduction to a topic, one expects lots of figures to explain just about every topic. This book, and indeed the entire series, generally has rather few figures. The series also, generally, focuses on the historical development of the topic and not necessarily on the current understanding of the topic. Therefore, the series sacrifices a better explanation of our current understanding to explain who thought what and when. However, that is a matter of personal taste as to whether this is a digression or not. Nonetheless, this book serves adequately in the capacity of a ""very short introduction."""
1,Arrived damaged,"We had seen other reviews warning that the packaging was poor, but we thought perhaps the situation had improved. Alas no. The refrigerator arrived with two large dents, a hole through the insulation in the back, and bent coils. Amazon was very good about taking it back, but could only give a refund since the model was out-of-stock."
1,Bad reliability.,"I bought this camera in Dec. 2004. After about 2000 shots, it went dead in March 2006. When I power on and off this camera, it behaves like it loses its mind. The lens retracts back and forth by itself, and it goes dead right away when I push the shutter button.Although the picture quality it took were nice, I am very disappointed by this A95's short life."
5,Excellent camera!!!,"The Canon A series are fantastic! We had a A80 for six years and loved it. We purchased the optional dive shell for ~$150 from Canon and used the camera above and below the surface to take AWESOME pictures--- I wanted to submit two lobster pics. (underwater)to National Geographic they were so good! Unfortunately after six years with a lot of abuse (dropped 4-5 times on concrete) our A80 started getting fuzzy so we upgraded to the A95 and love it as well. Same body, so it fits our underwater housing but it has even MORE features. Great camera! Congrats. to Canon--- I'm sorry to see they phased them out for slightly smaller models. If you can get your hands on a new or slightly used A80 or A95--- DO IT!!"
1,"Broke, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS! Boo, Canon!","I got the dreaded ""E18"" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year. Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again! This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem). My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another. Big mistake."
2,"Colors pretty good, but...","I got the Canon A95 -- the camera is okay, really. I am mostly satisfied. Most shots are in focus and clear, but i think the examples taken by Amazon customers show the problem I am having. The colors seem washed out sometimes. My friend's camera (a newer model Kodak) seems to have richer, deeper colors. She was printing on a Kodak printer at home. Maybe I am too picky?? I may have the Canon checked at a local repair shop to see if they can make the colors more rich. Overall, I recommend a Canon for a digital camera."
5,Used on my Honeymoon,"I loved using this camera! It's so easy to figure out and all the explanations are right on the flip out screen so there's no guessing which setting you are on. I used it to shoot fast moving waterfalls, and acrobats. It worked well at night and even caught fireworks and pyrotechnics perfectly. The 14 different shooting modes allow for any type of picture taking. All my wedding pictures look like they were done professionally and that makes my husband and I very happy with this camera (the first item we bought together)."
4,Defective CCD--Free fix by Canon,"The A95 and many other cameras of that era were made with defective Sony CCDs. Main symptom is distorted LCD and distorted or black photos and is more common in high heat situations. Canon will fix free of charge, regardless of warranty status. For more info, go to:www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=PgComSmModDisplayAct&fcategoryid;=221&modelid;=10468&keycode;=2112&id;=48264"
4,Canon PowerShot A95 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom,"Good product. It takes good pictures. Lots of settings, like sepia and black&white.;Processes pictures fairly fast. Although i've seen faster.Prepare to spend the money on rechargeable batteries, and a charger, or you'll spend it all in batteries, and still not have a charger.Overall, i really like the camera."
5,Canon PowerShot A95,Very easy to master basic functions. Excellent image quality. Many more features than can be quickly utilized.
2,Was good while it worked but pretty short life,"This was a pretty good camera while it worked, for about 2.5 years. It did go through batteries pretty fast and some of the shooting modes didn't work well (the pictures ended up corrupted and wouldn't transfer to desktop), but overall the Auto mode was good and it did a decent job. The biggest problem I see is a very short life."
1,Great Until E18 Struck,"I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004. A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck. I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling. I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it. For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.And then...There is an upgrade option. Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling. This comes with only 6-month warranty. Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON."
2,Interesting in retrospect,"This is a classic?Written between WWI and WWII, I found the Last and First Men interesting only in that the author completely missed predicting the future. Example: Germany becomes a 'peacenik' state. Then there is the boring writing style. This novel read like a laundry list--first this happened, then that, then they did this, etc. It was a completely detached perspective with no sense of connection to the story, no compulsion to find out what happens next. Someone described this as a history book, but history books are more interesting than this.I gave up after a couple chapters."
1,Consumer reports July 2010,"I threw mine out after reading this article in consumer reports. It may have been an isolated sample but its not worth the risk IMOThe samples of Muscle Milk Chocolate powder we tested contained all four heavy metals, and levels of three metals in the product were among the highest of all in our tests. Average cadmium levels of 5.6 g in three daily servings slightly exceeded the USP limit of 5 g per day, and the average lead level of 13.5 g also topped the USP limit of 10 g per day. The average arsenic level of 12.2 g was approaching the USP limit of 15 g per day, and the average for mercury was 0.7 g, well below the USP's 15 g-per-day limit. Three daily servings of Muscle Milk Vanilla Crème contained 12.2 g of lead, exceeding lead limits, and 11.2 g of arsenic. A fourth product, Muscle Milk Nutritional Shake Chocolate (liquid), provided an average of 14.3 g of arsenic per day from three servings, approaching the proposed USP limit."
5,It's great if you don't mind the price & the fat! Tasty too!,I love Muscle Milk! I've only had the vanilla creme flavor but it tastes great and has all the nutritional supplimentation I need.I drink it before bed and I find that it helps me sleep.It is more expensive and has more fat than others.
2,Beware,"I was not familar with the artist, but very attracted by the cover. The CD, unfortunately, was a disappointment."
4,Great music for creating a quiet atmosphere to work in.,"I work in a cube environment and I found this album to be excellent for creating an atmosphere of calm without distraction. I just put my headphones on and turn on the mp3 player, play this and I don't notice the hours roll by. I found the music very relaxing and the artist seems very accomplished. I would recommend this to other people seeking to create a calming atmosphere."
3,Good for meditation,"Very repetitious, but sounds great. I think that may be the idea. I would love to hear this with more layers of music. I may do that myself"
2,informational but not neutral...,the book offers some good insights and a history and evolution between dereg en regulated principles.However I strongly feel the book is a bit biased and only one side of the coin/story...
5,Essential background for the mess we're now in,"I read Harvey's book when it first came out. I'm not an expert on this subject, but the issues he raised in a highly accessable style worried me, although no one was talking about them at the time. Now, they're front page headlines. We think these decisions just happen, then discover when we read a book like this, that they're product of huge political interests, and that we, the ordinary citizens, pay the toll.A wonderful rallying cry for a more democratic approach to key energy issues.Paul Loeb Author Soul of a Citizen: Living With Conviction in a Cynical Time [www.soulofacitizen.org]"
1,"Fair tools, lousy battteries","My pal has an old 6 volt drill that can whip this Coleman set without sweating in the least. I got a generic 18 volt battery pack at Harbor Freight and have replaced the cells inside the Coleman's battery packs. The results have been much more satisfying. For the first time ever, these tools now actually work. I cannot recommend buying this set to anybody, but if you are stuck with one, and are handy with a soldering gun, this will cure it's ills for $10 per battery. DG"
1,Worst you can ever have.,"Dont even bother to look at it. I bought this set from Costco. I opened the set after a while about 6 months after purchase. Thats the biggest mistake I did, I cant return it anymore. As the other reviewer mentioned reciprocator eats up the whole battery in a small job. The biggest problem I had with this set is the batteries. They loose charge so often that keeping them charged in the box will not help at all in your next job. You have to either plan the next time you requires this toolset so that you can charge the battery an hour in advance or keep it charging at all times if you need them any minute.I would rather recommend deWalt or Hitachi or Makita any day. Better pay once and have it for life."
3,Better luck than the others,"I have had much better service than the other reviewers. I have had my set for several years and am still happy with it. I mainly use the drill, the light and the circular saw (in that order) but have had no problems. They don't seem like heavy duty tools but for light use I find them fine. I only paid about $75 for mine new and both batteries are still recharging and holding a charge."
3,Beautiful Music from Around the World,"This CD is a collection of music by various artists from South East Asia, Africa, Ireland, France, USA, etc. It's a bit ecclectic - the common thread is that it's all sacred music. But if you like variety and intense, melodic, ethnic music, than give this a try. Chances are after listening to the CD you'll want to buy CDs by the individual artists."
4,Not my 12 step program,"I do not recognize the 12-step program the previous writer refers to... ""the profoundly Christian slant..?"". Nah, that is not my 12 step program, thank god/God/HP... As far as I am concerned, part of Bill W's genius was that he made the AA program open for any spiritual orientation. You can get sober as an atheist, a buddhist, a muslim, a christian.. and a pagan of course....Which is not to say you should/n't read this book - my concern is people that try to make the 12-step program into something it is not. It IS a simple program for complex people, of course...Be wise!"
2,does not live up to its potential,Mazzas book on dreaming is really the same old dream stuff you read about every day I did not enjoy it and do not recommend it
3,Ice can make for a slippery slope,"This book, although not without its beauties, was a disappointment. Ehrlich's observations about this fast disappearing quasi-life form are valuable. Yet rather than speak to the question of what the average reader can do to help avoid the impending catastrophe she justifiably anticipates, we hear the same old old claptrap about human and corporate greed and way,way too much about her relationship with her now deceased dog named Sam. For the reader new to the wonderful writing of Ms. Ehrlich, I suggest going to her first book, The Solace of Open Spaces."
5,great SciFi show,"Great history like, very good acting. I love the characters and the way they integrated the super powers with the human flaws. Love it"
5,Alphas season 2,A great cast in a surprisingly creative and insightful plot line. Fun to watch and very nice visuals. Great writting- more thought provoking than much of the SyFy around- hope it continues on.Alphas -- Behind the Scenes Sneak Peek
4,"Good But Not As Good as ""Believe""","Enjoyed almost every song on Believe and enjoy most of the songs on ""Turn It Around"". Some of the pieces are not as happy as Believe and have a somewhat darker mood. The ones that are happier have a style similar to Believe and have the distinctive beat and tone of 4 Strings that I like. The darker mood ones feel more experimental. They are interesting, but I would not include them in a dance mix. Vanessa sings well in both albums and has a beautiful voice."
4,Extremely handy guide and terrific maps,"Just returned today from a week-long trip to New Orleans (my first). This book was an absolutely indispensable resource. Must have checked it 5-10 times per day. The best maps (by neighborhood) I've found in a travel guide, and the concise, informative notes on restaurants, parks and attractions were very helpful.Best plan is to combine this book with another (like Delahanty's Ultimate New Orleans) that contains more history and culture information. Taken together, you've got everything you need.But even by itself the Access New Orleans book is extremely useful. I found the information in the book to be spot on in every case, and it's so easy to use it makes you want to refer to it more..."
1,Completely useless stud sensor,"I already have a cheap Zircon stud sensor that works well enough but picked up this set because I had loaned mine out and couldn't get it back right away. I didn't mind since this one had AC sensing and I didn't think that my other sensor did that. I had pictures of the stud locations in the wall from before it was sheetrocked so all I needed the sensors to do was confirm locations that I could then mark. I could not get this sensor to give me any reliable indications after messing around with it for about 20 minutes trying every different calibration setting and location that I could over and over. It is the first and last Stanley stud sensor that I will ever buy.The tape measure seems fine but I haven't really used it much. Buy a good tape measure if you want a good tape measure. If you want a good(or even fair) stud sensor, buy something else."
5,How About A DVD?,The First Christmas Snow is a cute and touching Christmas special from Rankin and Bass and features Angela Lansbury as the voice of a nun who helps take care of a little blind shepherd boy and though this is shown every year on The Fox Family Channel (It was show about two or three times so far this December of 2005) I wish it would be transferred to DVD!
5,"Wailers, Wailers Everywhere!!! Tacoma's Rock Band Icons","First, this is the ROCK BAND Wailers that came before Bob Marley. I must admit so some built in prejudice when listening to this great album... In 1965 my band lost its drummer, Dave Roland, to the Wailers who can be heard on many cuts of this album. That's Dave banging away in ""Out of Our Tree"" and singing lead while banging on his drums in ""Bama Lama Bama Loo. Many of the cuts on this album exemplify the changes that went through the Wailers in the '63 to '65 time period when they has some personnel changes and transitioned from an instrumental/vocal band into a fine popular vocal group. The loss of Rich Dangel was great, but was replaced by a great guitarist, Neil Andersson... Mike and Mark left, but Dave and Ron amply filled the voids. These were dynamic and positive changes in the band that can be heard when playing the cuts in chronological order."
2,Covered from front to back in highlighter!,I understand it was a used book but every line is highlighted!You can't tell what is important or not?Hard to read because of this!
5,more splendid than a trip to the zoo,"all right I have to keep this down to 1,000 words.but I think I can.pissing razors newest rules!its their best release yet,it sounds more like their first one,but is heavier,its great.treat yourself to a good time buy this cd.it has 13 songs of variety and 100% metal.no korn he!"
5,Shampoo Planet,"Being a fan of Couplands other novels I pretty much expected for this to be along the same lines, it was but thats a good thing."
1,ONE MISERABLE BORE,"I only finished a quarter of this book because I was afraid that I might die of total catatonia. Coupland is definitely the worst writer of the 90's , if not of the 20th century!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worthy relic,Intimately epic live performance of hardened but emotional Italian progressive is admirably pulled off considering its huge ambition.
5,Great dual phono preamp!,this thing is great. It adds a nice light show to your rack and also serves as a dual phono preamp for connecting your turntables or cd players soundcards and stuff. i don't use the BPM functionallity it just serves as a great preamp. don't forget to ground this thing to something for clean sound! does its job very well! who ever says behringer is terrible is harsh.
5,Nice sampling,"I really enjoyed this collection of tracks from some of the top didgeridoo players in the world. There is a nice variety of styles and approachs to using the ancient instrument in modern and sometimes not so modern ways. I think in many ways, this CD would be an excellent introduction to the didgeridoo for those curious about it's use in contemporary music."
3,"CUTE, BUT LACKS REAL INFO","Pugs in Public is full of cute little personal stories about pugs and their people, but is not a reference guide or a useful training tool. The book consists of photos of pugs in costumes at tea parties and the like. Also included is information about pricey pug accessories, my favorite being the $19,000 pug carrier in red crocodile with a sterling dog bowl and a cashmere blanket (if you're interested, contact Asprey & Garrand, NYC). In short, this book is written for wealthy, old women with money to burn on indulging their pugs. If you're looking for real information on the breed, keep looking."
4,Murder Mysteries in Paris,"This is the third book of the series that I have read. Being a Francophile, I enjoyed the setting and the cultural aspects. These books would also be good airplane books and then as one is winging ones way to Paris, upon arrival, you could tour Paris via the story locations.On the other hand, they provide a mini vacation from home."
5,******,This was a gift for my sister who is a BIG fan of the show.and this was from one of her favorite episodes so it went over great with her.She loved that so much attetnion was paid into getting even the smallest details inot getting this exactly like the one used in the show...so..as i said...went over great with her and that makes it teriffic in my book!!!!
4,"Clear, concise, readable","As a new Access user with a target MS-Access 97 applications user group, I needed something beyond the beginner level that covered all the bases. I found this text to be most helpful to use as a self-study guide and reference. I own this one and the Sybex Access 97 Developer's Handbook.In addition, I had a stumper issue on security I just could not quite grasp. I e-mailed the author directly. She cheerfully provided the answer I needed.The used book source was prompt with delivery and made for a most affordable purchase."
1,Disappointed,"Does Santana know about this release? This is not a release of new Santana material, this seems to be a compliation of someone's recordings of several live early Santana pieces. The recording quality is poor, the performances are poor to marginal, and the material is dated.When you see a followup release to such a smash as Supernatural you expect more of same and this release is far from that. This smacks of opportunism by someone with some old Santana tape.I can not recommend this release unless you just have to own every recording ever made of Santana. The tracks don't merit review, this release is very disappointing."
5,it works!,Not much else to say than it came when it was supposed to and it works. Good job every one.
2,Another poison compilation,"This is a tribute album on the band Poison, produced and put out by Bret Michaels, the lead singer of the band. Well to get started the first two tracks aren't bad, as two bands, I have no idea who , cover these. Then Bret Michaels does a few funky versions of hits with acoustic guitars. He re-sings fallen angel, something to believe in, and nothing but a good time. These three tracks are classic poison tunes but sound very good acoustic. However most die hard poison fans will have acoustic versions of these tracks from the Crack A Smile release. Then the cd really loses it with a weak 2nd side. You would really have to be a harsh die hard fan to purchase this one folks. If you want 4 or 5 new re-releasd singles then go buy it."
5,Building Lego Figures,Tons of fun for the Lego builder in your house. Great for using that pile of Legos in the kids room.
3,He-Man & The Masters of the Universe: Season One,"I own the BCI ""He-man and the masters of the universe: season 1, volume 1"" It's stated on the description to contain the FIRST 33 episodes, but it didn't. Most of the episodes from season 1 volume 2(ep. 34-65) were mixed with volume 1. Also, the episodes were not in broadcast order. I wish this upcoming ""He-man and the masters of the universe"" the complete 1st season's episodes will be in broadcast order and that the episodes from season two wont be in the set."
5,Phantom Stallion is a Great Series!!,"I have read the first thirteen of the Phantom Stallion series, and Mustang Moon is one of my favorites. Like all the Phantom Stallion books, a lot of different story lines are presented throughout the book. You get to know not only the human characters, but also the horses, each of which have their own personality as well. I highly recommend the Phantom Stallion series for any horse lover!"
5,I JUST LOVED THIS BOOK,"LIFE GETS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED FOR 13 YEAR OLD SAM WHEN SHE STARTS HIGHSCHOOL. WITH RACHEL SOLLUM TEASING HER AND HER NEW BEST FRIEND JEN THINGS ARE GOING OK UNTILL LINC SOLLUM TRIES TO TELL THE BLM TO CATCH THE PHANTOM,BECAUSE SOME STALLION IS STEALLING MARES SAM KNOW'S IT'S NOT HTE PHANTOM AND SHE IS GOING TO PROVE IT. BUT WITH 16 YEAR OLD JAKE TEASING HER IT GETS SO COMPULACTED"
2,Not his best,"I was really disappointed with this one-- It wasn't up to his usual quality. The story ""Lobsters"" was good, but it was just an excerpt from Accelerando.I really enjoy Stross, but as a big fan, I have to rate this one ""meh"""
5,Great agressive shocker,"I was initially a little shocked when I first got this album. However, it has possibly grown on me more than any of their other albums, and it is the one I always go back to first.I loved their previous effort (Sleep of the Angels), and liked the progression from Dead Poem. I guess I was expecting a continuance of that direction, and was taken off guard. I got over that quickly.Though this album has a few weak tracks, it is possibly more diverse than the average Rotting Christ album. The best songs make up for any minor shortcomings: Aeternatus, Khronos, Thou Art Blind, Art of Sin, etc. Aeternatus and Khronos are probably my two favorites, yet probably the most opposite on the album. There is also a great cover of Current 93's: Lucifer Over London."
2,bland and boring,"This is a cd that really shouldnt have been released. I don't much care for rotting christ at all, and this album is proof of why. Its boring, uninspired [junk]. stay away from it."
3,without photo,"There is no one photo in the whole book, this is very strange regarding a book for beverages.The explanation about beverages including espresso, cappuccino and latte, not bad, but not more than good as a Best rate.As summary, you can solve some inquiry with this book."
2,For the Starbucks enthusiast only.,"Let me state right upfront, this is not a bad book it just isn't what I hoped for. If you strive to recreate what can be had at Starbucks & CO this book is for you. If you however want to learn how to make the various coffees unique to Europe this book will disappoint. You will look in vain for the Viennese Melange, the Greek Cafe Frappe, or a Turkish Coffee. A rather meager handful of Italian Coffee's are the only real coffee's in this book. Everything else is flavor syrup this, and fudge that, with a scoop of Rocky Road on top, exactly the stuff I am tired of."
1,Ill Informed Rubbish,"I haven't read the Stackpole version, but it is telling that my version includes a foreword by a leading British tank commander of the war who, exceptionally politely, totally disagrees with the author.His information on British tank organisation and operations is abysmally wrong and almost every statement he makes about them is easily disproved. All-in-all the book comes across as a man with an axe to grind and no compunction at all in choosing his 'facts' to support his position.This book could be great, but its flaws are so great that unless you know the topic already, you will only be lead astray by his apparent knowledge and factual arguments.Overall, I agree with the foreword. Its total rubbish."
3,Forget about it.,"I really expected more. I was disappointed that the pictures were in black and white, items were really old or fairly new looking. The subject is so deep, I feel the author just skimed the surface."
3,OK for a quick read.,Fairly good for a book that's 15 years old. The problem I had was that both Megan & Tom were trying to get a relationship going and yet they were constantly keeping secrets from each other. Not a very good basis!
4,worked well. Good for young kids,"Pretty accurate, and used by Cub Scouts 8-10 years old. I ordered 2 and one of them didnt work right out of the package. Neededle was off the pin and would not rotate."
1,Terrible,"Compass works OK, but the thermometer is completely inaccurate, off by over 30 degrees. Its also very large in size, not ideal for backpacking. Look elsewhere, stay away."
3,Good music but poor quality CD.,"A rare collection of duets by the Supremes & Temptations. Interesting because they sing several Motown classics that they didn't originally record. But beware, the quality of the CD is not good. You have to turn the volume up much louder than normal. Sounds almost as if someone produced this CD in their garage! Worth adding to your collection if you're a Supremes or Tempations fan, but remember to turn the volume down after you've finished listening to it or you'll blow your speakers out!"
2,It is a very boring book!,"The book is called NJ Day Trips but the chapters in the book is not by Day Trip but by category. Ex: One chapter of all amusement parks in NJ, or one chapter on Museums of all kinds. When I look for a Day trip I would like to pick on town and know everything there is to do in that town and nearby.I would not recommend this book!"
5,"Fantastic Effort, Fantastic Results","Yeah, yeah -- you could say that this is quite different from its past two albums but a band changes and matures as it is supposed to! People who believe contrary are listening to hard rock and mainstream metal which are extremely confining and run across a thin line -- they break no barriers.This is a fantastic album! There are always omnipresent, great melodies, its never dull and with excellent production on top of it! It has been called a masterpiece and a failure in the underground metal community -- I call this a MASTERPIECE. A Buy-Or-Die purchase -- Go get it!!!"
2,The film is certainly better,"Like most people, I bought the book after watching the film... in fact it took me ages to find the book because here in Spain it was called ""the legend of the whales"". Anyway, I thought the film was very moving and since when I'm obsessed with a movie I buy also the book, I did.The first thing that surprised me was that the girl is not called Pai, but Kahu, and second, that it was told from the uncle's perspective rather than the girl. I though it wouldn't be good because on the film the uncle is a rather minor character... and in fact, it isn't.I found the story dull and had to make myself keep reading. The only good thing I can say is that at least it explained a lot of the myth of Paikea, which in the movie wasn't explained that much. Other than that, there wasn't anything to keep me hokked to the book.Niki Caro is a great scriptwriter because she made a fantastic film from this rather forgettable book."
3,Works fine but not precise,I got this thermometer for my first 10 gallon tropical aquarium. It works fine for seeing if the temp is in the proper range (74-82) but is not good if you want a precise reading. One square represents about 3 degrees and there are usually 3 squares lit up (the middle one being the brightest).
3,Good.........but,Good product and seemed to solve my issue of sporadic misses. But I guess I will have to customize the length by shortening them so I don't have that look of to long of wires under the hood. Once that is done and is paired with an upgraded coil and ignition module I am sure I will be even happier.
5,Best Boot in the Business...,"Hello all:This is the best boot you will ever buy! Our unit work Cadaver K-9's for local law enforcement in California. We used these boots in the recent Wild Fires, and they protected the dogs paws flawlessly! The soles of the boots are pretty much bullet proof (not really... a bullet would penetrate). Even with hot embers, the dogs were not affected at all. Mission complete due to Ruff Wear boots!"
5,Mr.Tucket,"Mr.Tucket, by Gary Paulsen, is by far his greatest book yet. It is about Francis Tucket who is in a wagon train bound for Oregon. He falls behind the train to practice shooting his new gun, and is captured by a groupe of indians. With the help of Jason Grimes (a one armed mountian man), he escapes the savages and learns the way of the mountians. There are two more sequels to this book, and I hope G.Paulsen will write another."
4,Tucket's Adventure Begins!,"In the 1800s, boys came of age faster at 14 years old. This story about Mr. Tucket starts after his fourteenth birthday when he receives a rifle. Of course, he and his family are on the way to Oregon to start a new life there but he gets in trouble and is separated from his family along the way without spoiling the story.I did enjoy reading about Tucket's adventure from Missouri but I didn't like the detailed, descriptions of the hunting animals. I find the story to be a great adventure but I wished that it wasn't gruesome which it actually was in order to survive in the wilderness. Thank God, we don't live in times where he have to hunt and skin our own animals. I don't mind reading about it but I wouldn't want to see or live it."
3,A little boy wanders of and finds a guy named Mr.Grimes.,"A boy named Francis Alfons Tucket lived in Missori and were moving to Oregon on a wagon train. For his 13th birthday he got a rifle and when he goes behind the wagon train to practice and he gets kidnapped by Pawnee Indians. After he escapes from the Pawnees, he meets a guy named Mr. Grimes and they wonder off together trying to find Francis's family and friends in the wagon train. Trully a good book."
4,Pretty solid except for the handle...,"...satisfied enough to rate this case a 4 out of 5 stars. My only complaint is that the telescoping handle will get stuck periodically and I have to jiggle it from side-to-side to make it collapse fully. Otherwise, the main compartment is generous and can hold enough for an overnight trip. And the computer compartment is well padded (if anything its a little too large for my MacBook Pro)."
5,Very Nice Case,"I bought this for my new Acer Aspire 17"" laptop, I love the storage and extra pockets for papers, I homeschool my children and this gives us the storage we need for our educational software, notebooks and worksheets without having them scattered and searching for them when its time to research ect.... The only problem is it will not fit in side ways but goes in length wise taking up most of the main compartment but because it still allows for the room of the adapter not a big deal. Very nice bag, we are enjoying it."
2,I like Targus Products - But this Notebook Case...,"I'm a real fan of Targus products. I bought in the beggining of this year a backpack for my 17"" notebook and I was impressed about the quality and lot of espace inside this backpack.So I realized that 17"" notebook is too heavy to carry on my back and I decided to buy this roller notebook case.I already return the first case and I'm sure that I'll need to return the second one. Its a matter of time. For some reason, that I can not figure out, the telescoping trolley handle stop working a few days later."
2,Good printer ruined by software bugs,"The scan function won't work with most setups, e.g. if you're on XP and a network (vs. direct connection) the scan simply doesn't work. There are hundreds of posts on the web about this problem and HP doesn't have a solution. After spending over 8 hours of my time on the HP online chat and uninstalling/re-installing (HP's primary solution) my $350 printer had cost me thousands of dollars of my time. This detracted from time I might have spent trying to fine tune the printing (which took a lot of tweaking to get even moderate clarity). HPs heyday as a printer company are over."
2,Don't buy this printer if you want to maintain your sanity,"The machine prints ok when it works properly, but it has multiple recurring problems. When the paper gets low (fewer than about 20 pieces left in the tray) it always jams. Always. Often it pulls more than one piece of paper at a time, no matter what kind of paper I try to use. The fax portion hardly ever works properly, especially if I try to fax more than a couple of pages. The paper jams in that end also, about 4 out of every 5 times. I have torn my hair out of my head with this printer. I just tried to send a fax 6 times, it jammed every time. The fax was only 10 pages. The funny thing is that my previous printer was also an HP (6110) and I had similar problems. I don't know why I gave HP a second chance. I will never buy another HP all-in-one. I might not ever even buy another HP product."
1,this is the worst printer and most difficult to setup and change settings...i HATE it...,this is the worst printer and most difficult to setup and change settings...i HATE it...my recommendation is dont buy HP printer products...
4,so far I like it,I own HP 7310 All-in-One for about six months. So far it works very well. I got occasional paper jams when feeding copier from automatic feeder but I atribute the jams to the poor quality of originals (worn and torn paper). Printing and scanning works fine under Linux. Be aware that HP printer cartridges are quite expensive. I guess this is true for all HP inkjet printers.
1,Less than a year and gone......!,I really NEEDED this printer. I even overlooked the 'shaking' of the printer and table it sat on during printing. In less than a year-the scanner errors began and the ink catridge symbols are a problem. I have always loved HP but now will try a Canon printer.
1,"i bought the model above this, and had to throw it away after 1 year","after 1 year and 2 weeks -- yep, on a one-year warranty -- my 7410 displayed ""carriage jam"" and the best support could do was tell me to take a $50 discount on a different HP printer. i said ""do you mean it's garbage now?"" and he said ""yep"". and much web searching confirmed it. what a deal. i'll never buy HP again. it was pretty noisy anyway, but i figured i'd get more ROI than i did. support person had a who-cares attitude, too."
4,I wish ALL fairy tales were like this,"This is not a funny book. Er, not not-funny as in poor humor, but not funny as in it's not supposed to be a gut-buster. Not funny as in not bought to make you laugh, like Squee or Lenore would be. It is also drawn in a more manga-ish style than Dirge or Vasquez' stuff. It has some very cool stories, most are gorey spin-offs from fairy tales. It is told through the eyes of a little doll. Again, it's not supposed to be funny but it is fascinating. The drawings are sometimes vague and hard to follow, and the characters all look a bit too similar to easily disifer, the first few storues were a bit too confusing, and I had to carefully re-read certain part to get what was happening, but it's a good book. Definately worth figuring out.The back also has trade art from Vasquez and Dirge, which I found a very pleasant suprise."
2,Colour of embroidery,"My major complaint is that the colour of the thread used for the embroidery is not the colour shown in this pic. The actual thread used is a brighter pink than the polo itself, making it difficult to read.My first impression is that the quality of the polo is not as good as i probably expected. Still have not made a judgement on this yet though."
3,Mediocre,The product did no preform as well as I had hoped. Several years ago I had a complete hysterectomy (ovaries as well) so this just din't alleviate the dryness associated with this severe dryness associated with a total hysterectomy.
1,Inserting suppositories containing 'hydrogenated oil' on a regular basis?,"I'm not sure whether the reviewers here are actually reading the product label ingredients, but these suppositories contain hydrogenated oil - whether you eat products with hydrogenated oils (it is very important for the body to avoid anything containing trans fats and hydrogenated oils) or take them as a suppository, your body will absorb it. When you consider how easy it is to simply insert a pure non-hydrogenated Vitamin E capsule as a suppository, I don't understand why anyone would buy this product. Vitamin E gel capsules work wonderfully as a lubricant, so perhaps consider buying one of the many non-hydrogenated brands."
5,Excellent product - very soothing,"This has just about solved my problem re recurrent yeast infections - very soothing, and can be use every day. I started out with a small package, then immediately ordered the 24 pack."
5,Zip-lock antistatic bags...,I have all of my extra hard drives and a few other electronic devices in these bags. I was so glad to find out that one can buy anti-static bags that are reusable.
1,Out-of-date,"Bought the 2001 edition for a celebrity benefit auction. Very disappointing; many, many outdated addresses."
1,Over stretched,"I've only read the first two of this series and won't bother to finish it. Ms. McCaffrey seems to have fallen pray to the modern SiFi writer's disease of padding the verbiage to get as many books as possible from an idea even if it ruins them.I think this ""series"" would have made one good book."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"This was also my first Anne McCaffrey book, and since then I've read many others. She is a great writer and has a wonderful imagination!"
4,A great book! Thoroughly enjoyable.,"This is the first Anne Mccafrey book I have read and I believe I picked a good one. I enjoyed the struggle of the characters to adapt to new surroundings and fight for survival. While the book did leave a very large opening, I am sure the sequels will fill in the holes left in the first book. Mccafrey paints a good picture of how society forms once organization and leadership take control. With Mitford as a militaristic leader, he was the perfect character to bring this sort of organization into being. This is the aspect of the book I enjoyed the most."
1,Survival of the Most Two-Dimensional,"Kristin Bjornsen was a student in Denver before she was kidnapped and enslaved by the Catteni, a race of war-mongering giant humanoids. She escapes from slavery on the planet Barevi, lives off the land, then is captured again. She and a multitude of others are dumped on an unknown planet where they must fend for themselves. Most of the writing is spent on scouting expeditions and the mechanics of survival and food procurement. Too boring for words. If you are looking for character development or plot, look elsewhere. So bad I couldn't force myself to finish.Is it just me, or have Anne McCaffrey's books gone to hell since the loss of Judi-Lynn Del Rey? Just shows you what a good editor can do."
4,Excellent book about the struggle to survive,"Freedom's Landing is a superb book by Anne McAffrey about the struggle of different species to survive together in an unfamiliar world. The Eosi are an alien species that invade weaker planets and use the people on them as slaves to either work for them or colonize new lands. Kris Bjorsen is a human who was taken when the Eosi attacked Earth. She escaped being a slave, only to be recaptured while trying to help a refugee Eosi. She is taken to a new planet along with about 800 others and forced to survive with limited food, tools and lots of unknown dangers. The colonists name ""their"" planet Botany after the English ship that helped colonize Australia with convicts, and together build a new society based on exploration, hope and freedom."
5,"FANTASTIC, SCARY, AND COMPLETLY NEW",WOW! This is sure a change from the dragon riders series. I found this book frightening and compelling. She shows the can do attitude present in Americans under very frightening circumstances and carries the story through brillantly. I couldnt get the next book fast enough.
3,A Good Utility bag,"I got this for my Nikon D7000 and can fit in about 4 of my lenses(18-55 kitlens , 50mm prime lens,a tele and a wide angle lens) & the camera body. I also fit in a spare battery,cleaning cloth, memory cards,remote,pens,keys and lens cleaning kit.The material and liners used are of very good quality. The bag is rugged.Pros:A very versatile utility bagLots of small,thoughtfully done pouches/spaces in the bag to accommodate a lot camera gadgets.Cons:Not water or dust proofCan be a bit of a pain on the shoulders..not recommended for wearing for more than 20 mins on your shouldersI would recommended this bag for people with a less pair of lens(2/3 lenses).Anything more, I would recommend an SLR backpack"
3,Good but too small,"After reading a few positive reviews I went ahead and purchased this bag. While the quality is good and does have storage for accessories, I found it too small. I carry two lenses 18-135 and a 50M with a SB700 flash and it is a tiht fit with not much room left. The picture makes it look like it can comfortably carry more than it can - there is a lot of tight squeezes to get everything in. I am now looking for a larger alternative."
4,Nikon Camera Case,"This is a wonderful case that houses my Nikon D60 camera perfectly and securely. Yes, it looks like a camera case, and it will look like you are carrying a camera. If you don't have a phobia regarding such matters, this case will work well for you."
3,camera case,"husband wanted a different camera case for his Nikon DSLR he wanted the logo on it among other things,, this was the cheapest I could find and he really likes it"
1,so-so faucet,"Soap dish hangs above the faucet, so after only a month, I noticed the bronze plating is coming off from the soap dripping on it."
4,Uncomplicated Keyboard based Instrumental Jazz for Anytime,"No Standouts Here, but thats ok! The L.P. is Very Nice, Clean, and layered well. There are shades of Bruce Hornsby and a laid back George Winston to be heard hear. Piano and tastful synths are used in a pastoral like feel. Some later cuts have a more new age feel almost Moby-esque, more rythem and synths used, w/some voicing. The transition is nice. All The Melodies sort of fall around you like an early gentle midwestern rain. The tunes all fall around 3 minutes long.A great Album for someone looking for a contempory Jazz album and/or introducing someone to same."
3,A decent movie & video guide.,"I've had this new 2000 edition of Leonard Maltin's video & movie guide for just a little while, but I do look through it every now and then. I have to admit that it's not my favorite movie guide though--that honor goes to Video Hound's Golden Movie Retriever (the best out there in my opinion). Something I have noticed about this guide is that the index of stars in the back isn't totally complete. Great actors like Klaus Kinski and Christopher Walken aren't even included. I still think that this guide is pretty good and worth owning, but Video Hound's Golden Movie Retreiver is much better and the best on the market."
1,No respect for film.,Leonard Maltin has to be the rudest and most arrogant of all the film critics today. He will not give a film a chance if it is less than perfect. About the only films in this book that get 4 stars are the classics like Citizen Kane and Casablanca.
3,reveiwing the reveiwer.,"Here's the deal with Leonard Maltin. Most of the time he delivers very good and informative reveiws that I find helpful, but when he doed not like the movie he is reviewing the reveiw usually falls short. In a way it makes sense that he would not go into the detail he would on a film he loved versus a film he hated considering there are thousands of movies reviewed here, but then the bad review is sort of worthless if he's not going to give a lot of thought into it. Sometimes a bad review is worth reading.Another thing I want mention about any film guide Leonard Malten has put out is that if you watch movies and don't hold things like bad direction against the film then releaize Leonard Malten dose. Thats just being a good critic, but I can see were is would get on some ones nerves."
3,Not all that bad.,But whats the deal with him not giving a film four stars in the past couple years?? So far its 4 LITTLE GIRLS! Thats it!
2,Way off the mark...,"Maltin's reviews generally have nothing to do with the actual quality of the films. Mostly, the movies are a whole lot better than their absurdly inaccurate ratings suggest. I often wonder if he designates his star ratings at random. Check out Roger Ebert books for detail and validity."
3,"The man is human, give him a break","So he slams your favorite movie, so what? Just because YOU like it doesn't mean everyone will! I recognize that Leonard can tend toward the conservative and stuffy, but honestly, who is going to write a book where EVERY review is to the reader's liking? If anything, the whole 5-star system is severely limiting. You cannot judge most films on a 5-gradient scale. I do not believe the entire spectrum of films ever created can be boiled down to A, B, C, D, or F.I give him credit for tackling the amount of films he does, and he is surprisingly insightful, given the limited length of the reviews he writes. Just don't take it personally whenever he happens to think that your fave movie just might be garbage. Let's see YOU write a book and please everyone!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This product made my skin break out uncontrollably for over a month, I stopped using it, and started using apple cider vinegar and my skin cleared right up, sounds weird, but IT WORKS! ObAGI IS WAY TOO DRYING, even for my very oily skin, The oil under my dry skin had no where to escape and caused huge breakouts, save your money and buy a $3 bottle of ASV"
2,No lightness,"This recording exemplifies a certain pedal-heavy, bass-heavy approach to Mozart that I'm told exemplifies a certain school of performance prominent in central Europe. It is technically proficient but the exact opposite of what most of us hear in Mozart -- the quality that Italo Calvino called lightness. This is one of the things that makes pianists say that Mozart is the hardest composer to play well. The muffled, unfocused sound quality is also quite off-putting, making the set sound as though it had been recorded from the back row of a concert hall with the acoustics of a public lavatory. I would like to hear Ms. Deyanova perform different repertoire under different recording conditions. I suspect that this set (and this composer) don't present her at her best."
1,Not for exterior use,"This caulking may be good when used inside as another reviewer mentioned, but it is not worth the time or trouble for exterior applications. It does dry fast. It's paintable and cleans up well with water. This caulking will crack and shrink within weeks of application. Adhesion is weak at best no matter the type, cleanliness, or porosity of the surface. You will be re-caulking every few months.Use a non-DAP solvent-based elastomeric caulk for your outside projects. It's worth the extra $$$ upfront."
1,junk,This watch is junk. Returned 3 times and never got a properly functioning replacement. Finally gave up and just got my money back. There's no way to give it a zero star rating or I would.
4,Peter Elbow,"Route 66, The Diary of A Five Year Journey Across America, began as an afterthought from reading Writng Without Teachers where the author states that writing coherently for ten minutes at a time is all that is required to become an author of a novel or an epic story. 15 years later and having 23 titles listed I still feel its the only healthy way to write a book or a novel. That is, simply putting down the words ten minutes at a time, albeit, coherently."
5,one of a kind,"Once you start listening to this album, you will start dancing all night and day long. Simply a masterpiece you can't afford miss it"
5,Cute and comfy,I purchased the Tommy Hilfiger Distressed Bobbie Slip-On quite a while back. I love these shoes. I even purchased a second pair in a different color. These make the perfect slip-on for summer days and during the spring. I like to use mine when I haven't had a chance to get a pedicure. This helps to hide the toes. I've gotten lots of compliments on these shoes in both colors. I think the distressed look makes them even more interesting and adds to what you can wear them with. They go great with shorts or capris.
2,A bit confusing,"Faure's treatment of various Buddhist approaches to sexuality (he often trails away from the particular subject of sexuality into Buddhist approaches to desire, which are often not the same thing) is often verbose, confusing, and, all in all, poorly stated."
5,Inspirational A book worth sharing over coffee or a gift,I truely enjoy inspirational books and one based on humanity and true events. They make me happy to be a part of the Human Race. Now if I could only find an english translation of this wonder book. I recommend this to to anyone who needs suplimental reading to thier daily bible readings. Hugs blessings smiles (acts 3:6)
2,Ehh - its okay,"This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made."
3,Just a little more work.,"Good screen tent, nice inside area. Putting it together is a problem, the poles snap together and are supposed to be held together by springs that slide into slots on the inserted poles. Be warned--- the spring/slot concept is flawed as they don't hold together when constructing the tent. I solved the problem by screwing self tapping screws into the slots after slipping them together. It holds steady--- but don't try to assemble this without doing it because it will frustrate the Dickens out-of-you when it keep s falling apart. As for the chap who didn't know what the extra stakes were for: They are used to hold down the sides, just look for the loops at the base of the doors. We live on a lake and get 40mph winds often, the tent holds up fine under these conditions. One other negative-- it's made in China. Wish I knew, we need to put Americans back to work!"
3,Good but could be better,Good singalong but unfortunately did not capture my 18 month old sons attention as did other Disney singalongs. Nothing compares to the DisneyLand Fun singalong
2,Gets dirty quick and hard to clean,"These shoes are hard to clean. Dirt gets on them and sticks and because of the soft finish shows very clearly. I am constantly cleaning them.Would only recommend these shoes if you live in a place where you will never have to step on grass or water or anywhere where dirt will get on your shoes. Not sure where that would be, but if you live there you can buy these shoes."
5,Best Tug of War Toy for a Retriever,I have a Golden Retriever who loves to play tug-of-war. I bought this for him and it's become one of his favorite toys. The soft fleece doesn't tear or rip nor does it hurt his mouth and teeth when we play. It's held up exceptionally well...amazing bargain for the price!
5,Dogs Love 'Em,I bought these for my little Italian Greyhound to play with. He loves these things! He hasn't torn one to shreds yet which is a plus!. Get a couple for yourself and see if your dog doesn't just love them like my dog does.
5,Another awesome Abby Hayes book!,"This book was as good as all the rest of Abby Hayes. It was really goooooood! It made you feel a lot of different emotions in this one, such as surprised, dissapointed, excited, and happy! It was different from the rest of the Abby Hayes books, in a really good way, but if I said it, then it'd give the book away to people who haven't read it! All I have to say is 5 stars and everyone should read it!"
3,A Lukewarm Read,"It's cute. I enjoyed the ending, it was quite surprising! It luckily saved the overly used plot. But the writing is VERY... amateurish. Example?'""Can someone make me hot chocolate?"" It was Alex, their younger brother. He had a faint scar over his left eyebrow, where he had run into a slide. His hair was tousled and messy. His sweatshirt was backwards. At least his socks matched. That was better than usual.'It gives you a good example of what Alex is like but when I read this to myself/aloud, it sounded repetitive (he, he ,he, his, his, his) and their was little sentence variety.A good read for those ten and under, but older children will be bothered by the monotonous structure/notice certain spots where stronger writing could be used- like I did."
5,A classic Darwin critique,"This little known work is one of the best critiques of Darwinism ever written. While the Darwin bestseller trade harps the standard line to ensure sales, this work x-rays the subject without compromise. It is regrettable that it should be out of print and available only in large libraries. Tracing the history of evolutionary thinking and the confusions of the debate and the Neo-Darwinist synthesis this is one of the clearest treatments of the issues that covers the technical details with competence and without an agenda. The author was a developmental biologist, which had its share of skeptics on Darwin's theory. This book appeared as the DNA revolution was starting to rediscover this perspective, yet keep the Darwinian twist on the subject. Small wonder the ID people took up the slack, but it didn't have to be that way. The author has no religious agenda."
3,review of the armband.,"I was a little skeptical at first of the arm band as I thought it was going to be the same as the others I have bought, however it is more comfortable and easier to wear than the others I have purchased in the past. also the armband is more likely to stay on during my more physical workouts"
2,Band too big,I gave this as a gift to my 19 y/o daughter. She had to return it because the band was too long for her to secure it around her arm. The velcro did not extend far enough on the band--poor design.
2,okay,"They are o.k. if you rinse them really really well. The smell is off putting but they are o.k. if you are doing hard core dieting or off of carbs. I have since decided that real pasta (wheat, or w/ fiber, or protein) is a better substitute. The Shirataki noodles are extremely rubbery and make it difficult to chew but the noodles themselves don't have a flavor. I now see them in my local grocery store, but still never buy them."
1,"Fettuccini shape, inedible texture and taste.","I can't believe this was made and packaged for human consumption. I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma.Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew.Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls."
1,Never got the product although I've paid for it.,"I order this item along with the regular noodles and never got them. Have made a million attempts with no success. I have been charged and already paid for the item, which shipped from Gristedes. Will probably never order from Amazon again. I have gotten no satisfaction and the last email I sent was never even answered."
1,Gross!!!!,"I bought these thinking they would be a great low-calorie alternative to pasta, they were not even a good alternative. I prepared the noodles according to the directions and tossed them with my favorite pasta sauce. I took one bite and the rest went in the garbage. The texture was horrible. I suggest buying just one package to try before stocking up!"
1,Absolutely Disgusting!,"I thought these noodles were going to be ""The Answer""! NOT. I don't think I have ever placed anything in mouth as disgusting as these noodles. My husband and I sat down to a dinner of ""fettuccini"" made with these noodles and after about one minute we were almost fighting for the bathroom. Yuck Yuck Yuck."
2,Tofu noodles are not like spaghetti,"When I saw the spot on access hollywood for these noodles I was really excited! It took over a month for them to arrive and I cooked them that night for dinner. They were not what they had promised. The texture isn't like spaghetti at at, it looks like it, but does not taste like it. They felt like worms in my mouth (I know that is gross, but true). They also had a very offensive smell- like fish. YUCK."
3,japanese noodles,"The noodles come wet and refrigeration is necessary. The pkj. maybe serves 2 and they need to be rinsed before using. They have little or no flavor so would adapt to whatever you were serving over them. I don't think you would want to eat them plain. However, this is good for dieters as there are no calories carbs or any fat.It took a long time for them to come after i placed my order. That was a minus."
3,a little stinky!!!!,"The faux fettuccini does (as it says ) have a stinky smell which can put you off a little. Once you rinse it off, it does get distinctly better. This is a good product to use as a low calorie, low carb substitute for pasta but texture-wise it is rather rubbery. If you can get past that difference, it is good with sauce. It works especially well in casseroles and soup."
4,Definitely purchase for my husband,I'm not much of a fan of this cartoon but my husband is. I can tolerate watching some of this with him. Just bought season 3 so now he has all of them (once it comes it comes in the mail) and he seems very satisfied with the first two seasons.
1,Uhhhh... This sucks.,"HEADLINE!!!!! MIKE JUDGE BOWS TO CENSORS!!!! Good points- It really is nice to see a set with remastered video. The Time-Life set and The History Of Beavis and Butt-head were the only versions that weren't bootleg copies.That's it! Bad points- WHERE DO I BEGIN? CENSORSHIP-Why can't we get these in their original format? MTV showed these on TV but NOW they're offensive? Mike Judge will make another fortune from this set because he bowed to the censors. Why should someone tell me what's offensive to me? It's NOT ok to show things concerning cigarette smoking, drugs etc. but it's ok to show Beavis coaxing a turd out of his bunghole? This set is like- chicken at Thanksgiving, a rainy Christmas day- you get the idea, something just isn't right. Think I'll skip Vol 2 etc. Like Butt-head says- This sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before."
4,unreleased my @$$,"real quick, it says there are 14 ""Never before Seen"" episodes on this box set but the 14 episodes that were so called ""never before seen"" are fake, i saw them all the other night on MTV2 in the early morning so how is that unreleased? but anyways i got my copy for 25$ so im happy with it seeing how i havnt really seen this show in a long time. the only thing that dissapoints me is the Episode entitled ""Beavis and Butthead are Dead"" (which was the final episode for the show) was not on this box set."
3,The Shorts Are Edited,This dvd boxset is heavily edited. all most of the shorts in the 2nd dvd is edited. but then yet its ok for a used copy. the bonus featuers are good with the documeantry of b&b. IF YOU WANT UNEDITED GO BUY THE OLD VHS.
1,This sucks - huh uh eh huh,"Why this sucks:1. The videos are missing, even though the promo said there wasgoing to be videos. There is a small collection of videos onthe 3rd disc. What a scam.2. I don't think there were b & b seasons, but they shouldrelease all episodes in chronological order.3. The intro is missing. No "" ..because the little weinerheadsmake us laugh.""4. Lengthy commercials you can't fast forward through.5. No TP for my bunghole !! No wait, I'll use this dvd to wipe."
3,More of the same disappointment,"Every other TV show for the last 50 years is being released on DVD in it's entirety, but not this one. Why? I have the Time-Life 3-disc compilation set, and this new one appears to have many of the same episodes. If you cut out commercials, music videos, opening music and end credits, each episode of Beavis & Butthead is probably only about 15 minutes long. If the video companies weren't so greedy they could fit every single episode of B&B onto a single box set (a DVD can hold at least 3 hours of material), and make all of the fans incredibly happy. I wish they would, but you know they won't. As for the music videos, while the boys' commentary was amusing, it was in reality nothing more than filler to stretch out the show to a half hour (that's my opinion). One reviewer mentioned the legal hassle of getting consent from all those bands to use their videos, and they were right. It's not worth the trouble."
2,With Videos?,Not! How the hell can they leave out the best part of the show?Major dissapointment for this B&B; fan.
3,Not a season box? I'm not surprised.,"I do think this will be better than the Time Life editions, but I really doubt we'll ever see B&B in full unedited seasons as it should be on DVD, because I'm sure securing the rights to every video that appeared is IMPOSSIBLE. Back then TV shows didn't go to DVD so there's no stipulation there for DVDs when the artists agreed to have their video on MTV. It's a shame, 'cause they're just not as funny with the videos edited out, but I don't know what they could do about it."
4,What the hell mike judge,I'm happy beavis and butt-head is getting put on dvd because i love beavis and butt-head more then any fan. But mike judge is making 3 volumes of this dvd which has 40 short episode's each so by the time all 3 volumes come to dvd it will only have 120 episode's but the series has 200 episodes so instead of me having to spend money on something i have Mike judge should put beavis and butt-head on seasons on dvd so then all the die hard fans con watch the best show that was ever made on dvd. Now i'm not saying Its Mike judge's falt that this is not happing but hopefully it happens.
2,Waste of Money Unless You're REALLY Wanting It,"I was a little leery - a 40 episode ""best of"" set. I went against my better judgement and picked this up anyways. Why oh why did I not listen to that little voice inside my head. Not only are these NOT that funny anymore (Thanks Redstone and Mike Judge for taking forever to put these to DVD), WHERE ARE THE MUSIC VIDEOS!??!?! To hell with licensing rights! Half the bands they watched videos for never even made a major record debut. Ooooh boo hoo, you should be lucky you even got any exposure in the first place.Aside from only getting minor chuckles out of this anymore, and the poorly slapped together format, it DOES bring me back to when I was a kid and I can rmemeber exactly where I was and what I was doing when I watched most of these for the first time."
4,outdated but still useful as introduction,"I found it quite useful to gather the necessay skills to start Mathematica, though it is rapidly becoming outdated and certainly lacks any in depth commands."
4,Woodcock Shooting,Very good book. The reader gets a feel for the era that the book was written in. The language used in those days and the knowledge about woodcock is very entertaining. It reads like a poem
3,"Nice for Collectors but not a great ""how to"" book","This book was written many years ago and is a nice addition to my collection but I wouldn't consider it to be a book that would quickly set you on the path of woodcock hunting success. When I read the reviews someone suggested it read like a poem and I didn't fully understand that, but it truly is written like a poem. It is almost as if it is fiction. I like books that hit you with the facts and this one does not do that."
2,reemer too small,I bought this as a replacement of an old glass juicer that broke. The reemer center of the juicer is the right size for key limes and that is about it. Forget grapefruit or even big oranges.
2,A Great Come-down,"All the power to those who loved it and who see a lot in the author. I just didn't appreciate the effort, didn't see what all the fuss is about, didn't see talent, skill, intelligence...blah, blah, blah. The raves blew me away and I had to read the book, but I have rarely been so disappointed. Compared to the best of Ross Mcdonald, to take but one example, I thought this really very thin. I was especially drawn to the piece by the cover raves speaking to the author's satirical powers, none of which impressed me. I found all of it terribly mediocre and old-hat. It seems to me that the older generation of detective fiction authors had real depth and solid literary talents to match the best of non-genre fiction writers. This is the sort of thing one calls pulp fiction and if that is what one likes, here it is in full glory."
2,Not my style,"When you start to read a book and almost at the beginning you know that the bad guys want to close Miami for the tourists you'll say: OK, I'll read it. maybe I'll laugh later. But when not so many pages after that you know who are the bad guys and what they want to do the book looses its thrilling part and everything else. I'm not saying that this is a bad book. Simply is not my style."
5,Get everything he writes!,"This is the first of the Hiaasen books with his character, Skink. Once you meet Skink, you will need to read all of the books with him in it. Read them in order as it's fun to watch the characters develop. I reread them often."
2,"Too Bizarre, Even by Hiassen Standards","I have read and enjoyed six other Carl Hiassen books so I know he has many zany characters,themes, etc. Recently I decided I needed a ""Hiassen Fix"" so I ordered this book along with Strip Tease. Well, I could not finish this book...guess I went into ""strange-character overload."" I hope Strip Tease is like the other books I've read; time will tell. (So many unread books in my library...so little time)"
2,The chirping birds will drive you NUTS!!,"The piano is great, but the STUPID BIRDS CHIRPING IN THE BACKGROUND EVERY 5 SECONDS?!! This cd will drive u NUTS. They should've just played the piano!"
1,no good,"this video does not compare to the sing-along with the junglebook characters on the cover. typically, my 19month old likes to dance but this vidoes gave him nothing to dance to."
4,Packed Full of Information,"The title is as basic as you can get yet has a deep insight into the geography of military operations and deployment. Its the nuts and bolts of how the military deploys its resources and moves them. If you are tired of military maps that show arrows of armies moving across a barren map, this book gives depth to how the military moves. Most interesting was space operations and the term ""Gravity Wells"" and Strategic Space Locations. This book should interest anyone seeking information about military planning and operations and infrastructure."
2,Ranting and Raving,"I don't know if I agree with this book... my body fat percentage seemed to be right on, but according to this book, the ideal weight for my husband, who is 6'4"" is 165 pounds! That is impossible! It said his body fat percentage was 34% while mine was 22%, yet said that height didn't matter at all, and only measurements worked. I can't imagine how gaunt and emaciated my husband would look if he was that weight!And what about body builders who have biceps bigger than their weight, and probably are less than 7% body fat? This book would tell them, according to their measurements, that they were obese!"
2,A different Stanley,"As much as my little girl loves Stanley and never tires of watching a Stanley dvd, she just was not interested in watching this movie version of Stanley. It takes a minute before the Stanley characters appears and it may seem like an altogether different show.I have tried several times to get her interested, even advancing the movie to the character's first appearance and still no go. I don't know if anyone else have had the same experience, but thought I would share mine.Cyndy"
5,Love it,This book is so great. It will tell you a lot about yourself. One of my friends said that it was like reading her soul!
5,Richter in Chicago,"I am not going to review Richter's playing, he is the master.But if you are thinking of buying this disk, think aboutBrahms: Concerto No.2/Beethoven: Sonata No.23same concert but better sound as is not so much filtered. The only change is the Sonata at the end, you'll get Beethoven's Appasionatain the other disk."
2,Doesn't fit very well.,"Over the years I have probably purchased a dozen or more K&N filters for vehicles and never had a problem with fitment. Not this time. This thing just does not fit well enough to keep from letting dust get by the filter. I had it to long before attempting to install it to be able to return it. I thought about listing it on ebay, but even if someone got it for like 10 bucks, I would feel guilty."
3,"Works great, but no hardware included","Light works great, fit right into the OEM bumper and harness. Looks identical to the OEM part but costs less.BUT - they didn't include any of the little thread cutting nuts to mount the light to the bumper, no big deal if your light is still attached and you can reuse hardware, but half of mine (and therefore half my hardware) was missing. So a two star deduction for the trip to the autoparts store and the $4 pack of hardware I had to buy to mount this thing."
2,Serious qualms,"As far as I know, it does what it purports. To say this is not enough, however. The scan is (not surprisingly) a memory hog, and it cannot be scheduled. Instead it comes on automatically when you log on. If, like me, you want to log on and get to work, forget it! Registry Mechanic will guarantee painfully slow start-ups."
2,Written from the heart.,"This book falls into the trap that many such books do which is basically that it's written from an extremely biased ""I remember this sweet game..."" breathless style.Don't get me wrong, I too am a fan of arcade games and I'm sure it'd be difficult for me to keep from interjecting my personal anecdotes into the narrative, but I was hoping that this book would contain a little more in depth information regarding the machines. As it is this book has some decent (but not great) pictures and some anecdotal memories of the arcade era of the early 80s.If like me you can't resist any book on this subject, then by all means pick it up and support the author. However if you are looking for the definitive encyclopedic retelling of arcade history this book is not it."
4,A book that I have been waiting for....,"....great book, only wish it was more in depth with the designers comments of the games and the culture they created. Ironicaly most of the classic videogames of the era were from Japan, a country with deep traditions in culture, could care less."
5,Sandals from heaven,"I think many of us have had a few pairs of sandals, and never quite found that perfect pair. Well, if you're still looking, this is the one. They are solid, not too heavy and comfort, well, you just don't know you have them on. That's how comfortable they are.I can tell you this right now, and you probably won't believe me until you have your first pair. You will end up buying a second pair. Remember my words ...Hans"
4,Great to have a few of these on hand,"We love our Snuggle Safe heating disc, and are happy that we can buy spare covers. After about a week on our dogs' beds, the covers are pretty gross, so it's handy to toss the cover in the wash and have a spare on hand.If the cover were a little thicker, I'd give it 5 stars. But for the price, I have no complaints!"
1,American Ground,Langewiesche's suggestions of firefighters stealing merchandise while the two towers burned is sickening. This author shows his complete contempt and lack of respect for the fallen firefighters and their families.
4,The Bare Necessities,"It's a good choice for the young children, that want to sing along with the Disney songs"
3,May Confuse Children,"I recently saw this video for the first time in years. While it emphasizes the fantasy and magic surrounding Santa Claus, it also incorporates many ideas (such as the pagan leaders) that are not normally associated with Christmas. I think it answers many questions children may have regarding Santa; however, it may also provoke new questions--such as ""How do the immortal gods relate to the true story of Christmas (Jesus and the nativity?)"" This video is a great fantasy, and demonstrates the brilliant mind of its creator, L. Fank Baum. Yet, I think it draws attention away from the true story of Christmas."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF A GOOD VIDEOTAPE!!,"This video clearly shows that Rankin & Bass had run out of ideas by the time they produced this horrible Christmas production! My family loves the other Christmas videos- Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, heck even Nestor- but I was looking at my watch the entire time praying to God that this stupid video would come to an end soon. Please people... heed my WARNING.. do not waste your money on this video,, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!! Go buy the Grinch or something"
4,DVD Life and Adventures of Santa Clause,I loved L.Frank Baum and the stories he wrote about. I did'nt know he put other ones out there. This is one that came from a creative mind like his! It is really good and brings Santa Claus in to a different perspective to others. Really enjoyed this one!
4,life adventures of santa claus,remeber the movie from when I was a kid. Time to share that with my own two boys. Nothing beats the olde classics since I do not buy any CG movies
2,Not so great!,"This collar certainly looked worth the money when I ordered it for my cat, but the rhinestones are falling off one by one. I would recommend a cheaper rhinestone collar for your pet."
1,Mediocre Beethoven,"First of all let me say that I'm basing this review on op.106. After I listened to it, I didn't want to acquaint myself with the rest of the sonatas. I've had the misfortune of coming across Nimbus records before, Vlado Perlemuter playing Ravel springs to mind, and saying that to avoid this set on the basis of the sound engineering alone is not an exaggeration. The piano sounds muffled and vague as if recorded through a mattress. As for the interpretation, I'm afraid to say that Mr. Roberts has a lot of extremely embarassing moments which completely spoiled the music for me. I'm not talking about a wrong or missed note here and there, but a whole bunch of them including the opening chords of the first movement. If op.106 is any indication of what the rest of the sonatas sound like then this is one set to avoid like the plague even at this price."
3,Hard Candy Dolly,"Well, for many of us this movie represented just about all that went wrong with Dolly's career in the ""crossover"" phase. It's gauche, and just about everything in it falls on the wrong side of the fence separating ""coy"" and ""camp."" But the cd has two classic Dolly songs on it: ""Hard Candy Christmas,"" and ""I Will ALways Love You."" Fans of Whitney's rather overblown cover of the latter should treat themselves to Dolly's enthralling version. This was my favourite Dolly song for years before it made the Muzak Circle of Eminence. ""Hard Candy Christmas"" is a perfectly mournful ballad. I do own this cd, but that's because I am an avid Dolly fan. If you're interested in Dolly at her best, I'd suggest you avoid this cd and get yourself a greatest hits that includes these two wonderful songs."
3,The movie adaptation of the great stage play,"I recently was called to play bass for a local production of this stage play. I bought this album to hear different variations of the great songs from the musical. Unfortunately, only 6 of the 17 songs from the musical were used in the movie adaptation. Skip this and buy the soundtrack from the actual musical. If you loved the movie, you'll like this."
2,not what I was expecting,"I am a huge JCO fan and I have enjoyed all her books except this one. It took be about an hour and a half to read and when I had finished, I felt like I had wasted an hour and a half. Even if you are a JCO fan I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Pretty indifferent stuff,"Doesn't give the kind of thick creamy lather I expect in a coal or pine tar soap. Also doesn't have a lot of the ""mediciney"" carbolic acid aroma that tar soap oficianados like. Finally, it burns the eyes pretty good, so not something you'd want to use with the kiddies. If you like tar soaps, spend the extra money and get Wright's Coal Tar or Grandpa's Pine Tar."
3,Did not notice a difference.,No real response from this product. At least it did not cost very much and was worth trying out to see if it would work.
5,My first purchase,"My 6 year old granddaughter loved the book received as an Christmas present. last seen she was busy comparing her list of desirable traits to vfind the right dog for her, which she may get when she is 13.I found this , my first purchase from Amazon really easy."
5,Great book,"This book is well organized and has lots of great information. Great photos and really like the box on each page that has grooming, train ability, etc for each breed."
1,BROKEN! P3 P5090 telephone recorder!,Item was listed as new. Clearly was not new because tape already had peoples voices recorded. tape recorder would not even turn on. cassette door was broken. seller is not very flexible. no owners manual in box. glass/plastic in door was out of place. working on a refund or replacement.
5,Inspired Collection,"What an inspired collection of music. Hearing three different settings of O Magnum Mysterium by Tallis, Poulenc, and Lauridsen simply blew me away. As always, Robert Shaw got the maximum performance out of his singers; the clarity of tone and precision of the singing allow one to simply sink into the music. Every time I have a bad day, I'm planning to play this CD to regroup."
3,"not her best work, but decent","Although this book is worth reading, I do not think it is one of Heather Graham's best by far. It took me a long time to read this book because I really couldn't get into it until about the middle. Once I got to the middle I finished it in a night. I thought the book jumped around a lot and had too many details on everything. I will definitly keep reading her books because I love most of them, this just was not one of them."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!,"I waited for this to come out in paperback, couldn't so I bought the hard cover through my book club. MISTAKE! I love all her work, no matter which name she's writing under, but this one is more like a 10 year old decided to write a story. The plot sounds so good, that's the only thing that sounds good. The characters are flighty,dialogue is bad. It's almost like a B rated moive. I wish I had waited and bought it from the used book store. My opinion, don't spend you rmoney, borrow the book. I'm not keeping mine!"
4,Boombox,"Great sound, I cant immagine why this item isnt sold in more stores. Quick and prompt service, arrived in execellent condition. Just wish that a extended warranty was offered."
1,Very disappointed in product!,"This has been on a shelf and used for 3-5 days a week for 1 hour a day and has stopped working exactly 6 months after it arrived! I expected more from this after reading the reviews, if I wanted a 6 month functioning electronic product I could have spent 1/4 of the price. :("
4,"Great unit, great sound!","Love the boombox. Sound is great, options are great. Although, the cassette player is pretty much useless anymore, you never know. There are still a few cassettes hidden away in drawers and closets at the house, so it may eventually be used. My main purpose was to upgrade to a boombox that had auxiliary mp3 input, and this unit fits the bill. The only real ""con"" I can come up with is that the display window for track number / radio station is too small (for someone my age, anyway!). Other than that, I love it.One thing I would point out is, if you plan for this unit to stay in one spot most of the time, be sure to check the dimensions. When it arrived, I realized I should have paid more attention to that. It's more the size of a ghetto blaster than a counter top boombox. But, it still fits the space I intended it for, and I love the sound quality and flexibility of the unit. All in all, a very good purchase."
4,Sony Radio Review,"This radio really does have great sound. I purchased it to use outdoors by the pool and while working in the yard. The only complaint I have is - and this was mentioned by someone else - when I connect my Sansa Clip MP3 player to it, I have to crank up the volume on the Sansa and on the radio in order to hear it. The volume just isn't there when connected to this device."
3,okey-dokey,"I must admit that I'm usually skeptical when reading reviews of products, and in the case of this boombox, I solicited all reviews before deciding to buy. While I expected stereo-sound quality, it is still a ""Boombox"" and sounds like it!"
2,"Good product, bad finish!!!","Winch cradle arrived packaged alright. Fairly heavy duty, nicely cut parts. However.... the paint job is terrible. It was flaking off in the box! Still worth the money, I think, but I'll have to sandblast and repaint for sure. Not cool, superwinch..."
1,Is there less than a 1 star rating?,"If there's less than a 1 star rating, this one's got it. Absolutely a waste of money. Just reimburse me for the postage and you can have mine - only played once and never again!"
5,"Barry ""SCORES "" again !","I think this is one of my favorites ! in fact I know it is ,I wore out 1 CD of "" Scores"" already for repeating it so many times ! Some of the songs are new to me especially "" Who Needs To Dream ?"" ,Sweet Heaven I'm In Love Again "",And !! "" Bolero de Amor "" !! I didn't think I could love his music more ,( or his musical talents )or HIM !! But with this album ,in my book he is off the charts. 'Of corse I'm probably his biggest fan,but,even my husband isn't complaining about my playing this day after day !(or my singing) UGH !!!!Nanci"

5,The Best in a Long While,This is the best book I've read in a long while! Brandt writes with knowledge and interest about scuba diving. You don't have to be a diver to enjoy this book. A must for any fan of mysteries. I plan on reading all in the series
4,"Quick, entertaining read.","With a setting that couldn't possibly be boring, this mystery entertains even though it is a bit formulaic. Moves quickly."
1,"Beverly Potter, Publisher, Ronin Publishing","This reprint of the classic ROAD TO ELEUSIS is ""unauthorized"". The only living author of the Work, Carl Ruck, asserts that the editor, Robert Forte, who has now published two reprints, has no rights to the Work. Mr. Forte may have an old contract with Wasson's daughter. However, he has never shown any contract to Carl Ruck.Carl Ruck has not been given even one copy of this reprint - his own original Work - and he is being paid not one penny from the sales. The publisher, a colleague, has chosen to remain mute on the subject of rights to the Work."
2,Poor Adriana,Recorded too late in either Sutherland's or Begonzi's careers! Should have been done fifteen years earlier with Pavarotti! Wobbling and warbling at times instead of lyrical singing! Rest of the cast is fine and singing is very good as is orchestra. Beautiful music is marred by the leads' attempt at singing. Why did Decca ever release this one during both singers' lifetimes? Surely Joan couldn't have approved of this recording. Doesn't do either' reputations any good. Hard to listen to at times.
2,I don't recommend,Most of the words I try to look up are not in the dictionary. Seems to be geared a little more to a Hindi speaker looking up English words than vice versa. I'm going to have to buy another dictionary because this one doesn't cut it.
5,Music to set your soul sailing ...,Beautiful arrangement of music that will move you from the very cor eof your being. The clear and crisps sounds are haunting and truly unique. The variation on a theme by Paginin is inspiring.You must own this cd in the Gold format.
5,Hauntingly Beautiful!,"If this music does not give you goosebumps, check your pulse! My husband and I are taking my dream trip to Mackinac Island (day trip) in May so I went searching for my soundtrack on cassette! It is all banged up so I came to Amazon to see if it was by chance available on CD . . . I am so thrilled to see it is! I'm usually a blood/guts movie kind of girl but I must say Somewhere in Time is my all-time favorite movie! I was so pleased to see so many other positive reviews!"
2,"Kinda good, not worth buying though","I bought this one on the recommendation of the reviews here. Gotta say I still haven't found any of the guitar work that I read about. Not to mention the songs stay the same speed for the most part with the same rythms and the same vocals just different words. Its like owning a disc with 1 song repeated 10 times. Not bad overall, just way below what I was hoping for. In no way would I ever compare these guys to GNR or any of the rock bands that carved the roads of the 80's and early 90's."
1,its a shame,when i bought this cd back in 2001 i think i thought that this is a band that has a future in rock n roll i nstead i found out thats iv wasted another $14 so it adds to all the wasted cash since the day nevermind came out
5,Simply Put...Amazing,"Finally, a band that actually plays rock music! This band has great guitars, amazing drums, and meaningful lyrics. The lead singer can actually sing, something uncommon these days. Each song has its own tune and they are all different, making for a reccord that can be listened to all the way through. I saw these guys open for Creed and I thought that they were amazing. This is a MUST buy for all you rock and roll lovers out there!"
2,B stock or Blemished,"This item is definitely not the same, new, ball you would find in the store....it is blemished or b stock....I thought when I got it, oh its just a few flaws, it will be ok..then my cousin who plays with these balls in hs thought it felt weird...We compared it to his that he just bought at a big name sports store. To be honest, it was not the same. There were flaws in the gluing all over the one I got on Amazon. the materials felt about the same, but the logo wasn't as nice, some of the writing on evolution looked off and the flaws....I sent it back to get my refund, so I could pay 10.00 more for the real, silky smooth evolution ball. Honestly, I have never had an issue like this with Amazon, but they should mention this is a blemished product...it didn't even come in a box..it came in a plastic bag."
5,Great,"This ball added 6 inches to my vertical leap, and I never miss a shot. If I dribble it inside of a bar after the game, I get free drinks and suitors are constantly throwing their hotel room keys at me. One time I was holding it while walking down the street and Kevin Spacey invited me to Paris for the weekend. Things got weird while I was their, but I don't blame this basketball for that."
5,evolution ball purhased on amazon,"great experience. needed a good indoor basketball at a good price for my son. product was as advertised, great condition and received it ahead of scheduled date - received within 5 days. satisfied customer! Also, was happy that it was an item that included free shipping."
1,Defective ball,"Ball is real but had a few minor issues with the ball from amazon.1) ball came in a plastic bag, no original packaging was included2) ball has a hard lump on the sidestill deciding if I will return the ball to amazon. As a consumer I assume that all products sold from amazon are free from defect but this obviously isn't the case."
5,great,"I love this ball it is the best indoor ball I have ever had the pleasure to play with. Way better than those infusions and other synthetic leather balls. The reason this ball is so great is because of the grip of the ball. Very soft in your hands, you feel in control the entire time. The ball will never get away from you. The grip also never deteriorates over time, that is unless you decide to use the ball outdoors. If your looking for a good indoor ball than this is the ball for you."
1,received defective or counterfeit product,"I agree with everyone else that this is one of the best basketballs. However when I bought it from Amazon I received one with a noticeably different surface which was very slick, without the cushiony grip that makes it so great. Also the name ""Wilson"" was not outlined in gold which is different from the authentic ones I have seen. My suspicion is that I received a factory dud which someone sold to me as brand new. So my recommendation is not to buy from Amazon at all. If you do, make sure it has the grippy surface you expected."
1,Just one word WHY?,"I don't know why this even exists. When in the first 3 min of the first track gets London Calling & London's Burning mixed up you know you're in trouble. The writer obviously has nothing but distain for the clash. If you're like me and have to have everything about the clash you'll get this, but do yourself a favor and get the cheepest edition possible, listen to it ONCE and then get rid of it."
3,lightweight review of recent research,"This is a good introduction to the topic. It contains some interesting points. One is that even very young children are affected by marital discord. Another is that exposure to discord is likely to make a child more, not less, sensitive to it.The book has its drawbacks. It's repetitive and heavy on fluffy citations, like ""How couples handle differences is also important in marriages (Margolin, 1979; Markman & Kraft, 1989)."" (p. 21). Do you really need someone else to back up an assertion that how couples handle differences is ""important""?Another example: ""Spousal disengagement and withdrawal are associated with current marital distress [three citations follow]."" If such statements of the vague and obvious were left out this book would be even slimmer than it is. These statements are the givens which made me want to read the book, to find out the why and how."
3,Detailed book ruined by the authors self praise,This is a very good book with a good history of the mac and what its creation was all about. Pity that the author ruins the book by continously talking about how great he is and how everyone at apple thought he was brilliant.
4,Effective,"I installed these to try and teach my kids about boundaries, privacy, and knocking first. They're fairly easy to install, inconspicuous, and effective.The only resaon I withheld the fifth star, is that they need to be lubricated before using them. Not really a big deal, but not everyone is married to a mechanic like I am, with WD40 just laying around!!I tried skipping that step (out of sheer laziness), and regretted it. They squeaked hoffically. Follow the directions, and OIL THEM!"
2,Light-duty,"This door closer is good only for fairly light doors. I have a somewhat heavier door, and the closer was not nearly strong enough to close it. I think that this would probably be fine for hollow-core interior doors."
2,Weak,"Do NOT put too much weight on this thing because it will definitely break and tilt to one side. However, I was sent new plastic after it broke and now just hang shirts on it."
1,Deceptive advertising,The title gives the impression that the reader will learn facts that could not be aired on TV at the time of the incident. But this is an auto-biography starting when Bob was in college.
5,Best Patchouli Scent!!,"I bought this lotion as a gift for my boyfriend, but after using it I have a feeling I'll be using it as often as him. We both love the scent. It has to be one of the best patchouli scents I've ever smelled. The consistency of the lotion is also very nice, and not oily at all."
4,Early Lyle Lovett,"A great mix of jazz, country and swing. Some humorous lyrics too. If you've never heard Lyle Lovett before you should try this one."
4,Good HRM,"Easy to set up. Transmitter is comfortable and works great...even without wetting sensors! Watch is still a tiny bit bulky, but that is common for a heart rate monitor. Plus, you are able to replace the batteries in the watch and transmitter on your own. Most other HRMs require the parts to be sent back to the manufacturer for battery replacement. Very satisfied overall."
4,"Good book, but too many discussion about very old films.","This is a very nice book, however, 3/4 of the book is a review on veeery old films from beginning of the cinematography history.You can find plot, cast, main idea and pictures for every film on the list.Basically, there is no need to buy this book, you can find all this info on Internet."
2,Beware the spoilers!,"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die could be a great film guide. It is loaded with both well-known and obscure films, many of which I have sought out and enjoyed after reading about them in the book. I've really started to enjoy noir films because of this book's recommendations.The fatal flaw in 1001 Movies is that they frequently give away the endings! For example, they often tell you when an important character dies at the end of the movie -- what is the point of that? Look for a different guide that doesn't spoil the endings."
3,"Massive work, sloppy errors","Ideal compendium for it's attempt to focus novices on a more complete path of film experience, but in many places not to be trusted for it's facts and digests. Forgivable I guess because of it's many contributors, but not so for any one reviewer not to be fully conversant with the film they wrote about.They left out ""Song of Bernadette""!"
3,"New Edition Corrects Errors, Has Wonderful Photos, But...","It's pleasing to note that most of the editorial errors which detracted from the usefulness of the earlier edition have now been corrected, but the main criticism I made of ""1001 Movies"", still holds good. The book is woefully unbalanced. Roughly a quarter of the pages are devoted to pre-1958 movies, while the remaining three-quarters focuses on the last 50 years. This appalling distortion means that most of the cinema's greatest masters have been excluded. Of course, all the fashionable directors are still represented, and just about all the current pop and cult favorites get a look-in. But those who are looking to expand their movie horizons will find few unfamiliar pictures in ""1001 Movies"". To my original review, I appended my own list of 400 essential films. Only 88 of these are represented in ""1001 Movies"".Hollywood Classic Movies 1: NEW LIGHT ON MOVIE BESTS"
2,Print cartridge,"The print quality of the cartridge is marginal. It appears that it may have been over-inked and suffer from excess ink on the roller. We continue to get smudges. The smudges are less noticeable as we use the cartridge, so it is possible they disappear in time. Right now we cannot get a clean page."
2,Puts a lot of extra toner on the paper,I'm not happy with this cartridge because it leaves black streaks and shading on every page. I would rather have paid more money and gotten a better cartridge because now when I need clean prints I have to take them somewhere else. I'm eager for it to run out of toner so I can buy a new cartridge.
5,A nice solid toner,"This is a really nice solid toner, work perfectly fine on my Samsung ML2510. When I purchased my first one about a year ago, I was skeptical about how well it could deliver. After a year of usage, I am very satisfied. As far as printing quality is concerned, I can hardly tell the difference between this and those printed from my company's commercial printer. At the price Amazon is offering, it is so affordable that I can print anything I want. Unlike with my HP ink-jet I have to really think about what to print and what to skip because there are not many pages available to print with each tank of ink. I would highly recommend this toner."
1,Yet again - vertical stripe,I bought two of these. Both had vertical stripes. One was unusable and the other is an irritation. Don't buy.
2,Not so good.......,"After reading the reviews on these I purchased several of them thinking they would be good but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. The print is just ok but the ink runs out very quick. It doesn't last for 3,000 prints, I don't even think it lasts for 1,500 prints. The Samsung cartridges are much better and yield a lot more prints."
2,ml-2010 cartridge does not live up to expectations,The cartridge leaks toner and does not have the output capacity advertised. I print mostly text and I have not used the 3000 pages that the manufacturer said would be the number of pages output.I would not buy this cartridge again.
1,Does not work in printer,"I installed this cartridge, and the printer would not start the warm up cycle. The light indicator flashed from green to red. When I put back in the old cartridge just to check, the light turned green and the warm up cycle started. This new cartridge does not work. Waste of money."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM PLEX SUPPLY,"I purchased 3 cartridges for samsung 2010 and 2 of them worked just fine. The 3rd one is still sitting in my room as it would not pull the paper through the machine. I contacted Plex Supply and they told me to deal with Amazon and whatever their return policy was. PlexSupply could care less that their product did not work...So, the product works fine... when it works. I just purchased two more from another company and I will let you know what i find out."
4,Best in OEM toner cartridge,"I ordered 2 of these and the quality of the non production product is excellent.I get about 3,100 pages out of each cartridge."
4,"Fits Samsung ML2510 well but prints 3 tiny ""check"" marks","Fits Samsung ML2510 well but prints 3 tiny ""check"" marks about 3.5"" apart vertically on all pages. Great for general prints but would not be good for resumes or where absolute clean pages are required. Also, if filling in forms with check boxes, the check marks may inadvertently fill in a check where you may not want. However, for about 25% of the cost of an original Samsung toner, it's well worth the price of less than $15/cartridge with free shipping on 2 or more."
1,"Previous cartridge worked fine, ordered a second, it's faint had to return.","The first one of these worked out great. Printed fine, lasted about six months. The replacement cartridge I ordered recently printed very faintly. Thankfully I was able to return the cartridge and received a full refund."
1,No Luck Whatsoever,"On the Samsung ML-2010 this unit could not be used.Every time I push the old ""compatible"" unit in, printer works fine. With the new unit, printer starts up but something keeps it from picking up paper from the tray. Send a print job, paper gpes in part way and then the rollers keep rolling - paper feed stops working.I don't know if this returnable or not. I'm more concerned with getting the printer function back."
4,Smells a bit funny but works alright,"I've purchased this twice. First one smelled a bit funny. Pages with a lot of black have a bit of a pungent tar-like aroma when they first come out. Some horizontal banding on picture prints, but text looks fine.Second one has worked great -- no complaints. Better than other off-brand toner I've used which has had major problems."
5,Works very well. No complaints,"I installed this cartridge into my ML-2510 BW laser printer. The cartridge was well packaged eliminating the possibility of spilling toner before installing it. The directions are straightforward to follow. I could not hear any new noise during printing. The print quality is excellent (no difference with respect to the original). In my view it is a very solid product. I would buy it again. And just to set the record straight, I was NOT solicited to produce this review."
4,Cheap toner cartridge.,Cheap toner cartridge. I have just printed a few things with it so far but it appears to deliver decent quality prints. Beats the full price Samsung brand toner for cost.
5,Brilliant toner,Works great and what a price! I won't be purchasing from the big name stores for triple the price again.
1,Vertical Stripe,"After reading the reviews, I was hoping for a product that wasn't defective in any way. But, as is the case when taking advantage of deals like this, I apparently got a bad apple.The toner went in the printer and began working immediately, producing clear and dark print. But it was also printing a vertical stripe down the right edge of the page that when touched turns your fingers black. I thought it might eventually fade away, but so far it has not.Looks like I'll have to find a better deal on one of these, disappointing considering the money spent on the toner + shipping."
2,Toner did not last long,This toner did not last more than a few hundred pages. All other toner earlier lasted more than 3000 pages.
1,Did not work in ML-2571,"Bought 4 of these, none of them worked in my ML-2571 even though the description and box says it does. When I put the cartridge in the printer just whines and it sounds likle the cartridge is locked up. Sent back for refund"
4,George deF. Lord's masterful edition,"George deF. Lord's excellent editing of Marvell's poems retains the spelling, capitalization, and italics of the Bodleian MS Folio, as well as the principles of styling and punctuation. The poems are carefully annotated, and organized in a most logical manner."
3,Good Basics,"This book introduces French grammar and vocabulary in 24 lessons, claiming each lesson can be read in one hour's time. Perhaps, but learning will definitely take more than one hour.The good things: if you are into lists of things, this book is for you. It has lists of intransitive verbs, common reflexive verbs, common adverbs, to name just a few. If you like plenty of examples, it has them. It provides a guide for pronunciation and Web sites for the alphabet and for practicing some difficult sounds.The bad things: Some translations into English are incorrect. In the passe compose chapter, the list of verbs that use ""etre"" as an auxiliary verb is not complete. If you like plenty of reading and writing exercises, you'll have to get a supplemental book. No audio."
3,Good but,Not very interesting. Lots of vegetables in VERY small pieces. There are several Baxter's soups that we prefer.
3,good machine for home office,"have this for almost 4 years and it is still working. we were experiencing jams towards end of extended warranty with office depot and they got us a refurbished one. we used to use it a lot more for printing but now mostly for scanning and to download photos from the memory cards. very easy to set up. it is unfortunate that the ink cartridges are so expensive. we used to refill our own cartridges but we ended up switching to a black and white laser for most of our printing. but if you don't use it enough, the ink head dries up. so now I end up buying generic color cartridge and hope to refill those when the ink is gone. so I am deducting 2 stars because of the high price of ink cartridge."
1,Poor quality - poor service,"I purchased the 7410 in Nov. 2006. Less than 3 months later it stopped working, giving an uncorrectable ""carriage jam"" error message. After countless time with HP tech support, they declared the printer dead and replaced my new printer with a refurbished one. The refurbished one lasted a week before it also died with the same error message as the original one. To add to the frustration, I had mulitple disconnects while talking to tech support. Each time they said that they were elevating my call, I had to explain the whole problem all over again to the next rep. Come on HP, is that the best you can do????"
1,JUNK !!!,Have had this 7410 for six months. It scans slow. It rarely will scan to Winfax. The software boo boos about every other time scan wise and must unplug replug. Ink is expensive. Software is absolute junk and makes it almost impossible to use your own scanning software. Card reader is OK. Copying is OK.
3,Printed is fine but not all features work,"After installing and using for a while, it works fine - just like the HP7410 it replaced. Then I tried to fax - the upper feed doesn't work. So I can't do multi-page copy or fax. it feeds about 1/4 the paper, then hangs."
2,"Good functions, poor quality hardware & software","I was disappointed in this printer. We purchased it despite some negative reviews because it was the only product that had all of the features that we wanted. It was a mistake. The software is hard to install, buggy, and *HUGE*. It has difficulties staying on a DHCP network with my linksys hub because it doesn't report a hostname (not sure whose bug that is, but if it reported a name like it should it wouldn't matter). Photo print quality is OK, but didn't excite me. Dual trays sound exciting, but it doesn't automatically switch from an empty one to one with paper, so what is the point?Then to wrap it up, it failed after 16 months of very light use, 2 hours with tech support resulted in the same offer as a previous poster: we'll sell you a new one at the same price as as on amazon, and you should buy an extended warranty (unstated: because we make shoddy product).Do what you want, I am avoiding HP printers for now on."
5,I Love This Album!,"I have loved this album for many years, but only had it on cassette. I am so glad to have it on CD now! It is a wonderful Christian/Rock album."
3,Still a good series...,"This is a series of books that I enjoyed when I was in elementary school. We got a few of them to see how my daughter would enjoy them as she has graduated from the Magic Tree House and other chapter book series. She enjoyed a few of the books in this series, including this one ""The Haunted Cabin Mystery #20). But I think that the series is a little dated and no longer appeals to kids as much as ""back in the day"". Some books and series like ""Little House on the Prairie"" are able to stay timeless. Others suffer from a datedness that doesn't add any educational value or extra appeal for current readers. The Boxcar Children mysteries may be one such series."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"DO NOT PURCHASE this costume, very cheaply made and it does not look like the package, received it today and it is going right back. It is NOT worth $30. I could go to the Disney store and get a nicer costume for the money."
4,Like Stepping into Another World,"I love this CD and often play it when the time strikes me as right for music that transports me into another time and world. I'm mainly writing this review because I think an album of this quality deserves more than the 1 Star review that it's so far received. By no means, however, would I be so presumptious as to present myself as an expert on ""World Music.""However, I do like this album...and having spent many,many hours in Ashrams and at World Music Festivals, I can say with certainty that this is a fine recording."
1,POORLY WRITTEN PROPAGANDA,"I was terribly disappointed by this book. I don't know what was worse, the poor writing or the overt propaganda. As you muddle through the book you get a feeling that the writer is an unoffical spokesperson for the P.L.O. The book is too biased to have any redeeming value."
1,Too Complex and Support Sucks,"Truly a piece of crap. Dozens of useless bells and whistles that add complexity but no utility. An entire industry of third party Goldmine consultants exists to charge you big bucks to make it do what it should do out of the box. The product is unstable and crashes frequently, sometimes destroying your data along the way. GoldMine support, if you can actually reach them, expects you to be a database wizard and patronizes you and gets impatient if you ask questions. For a while they eliminated support entirely, then offered email only and took two weeks to respond to me while my company sat dead in the water. Buy ANYTHING else. These people don't deserve your business."
3,Cyberpunky pulp-fiction,"HUMAN_WORMS is an interesting book with smooth going story which unties for the machine/human Genome, at the end. The literal hero fights with a gang of user-hunters. The Net is endangered by the hunt which evolves to a war capacity system crash condition. While the conflict moves from the bits and bytes to the mental-soul world, the Genome code generates a programmed stable existence and the mix end-future, receives a lighter result. But is this the ever lasting peace?A fresh-feel breath of contemporary spirit, cycles in and out H_W. As usual the Author writes in 2D text, but the mind of the reader is shown in to a richer dimensional world, the golden edge is to let it go. Somehow I always see Kenji Siratori as a future-documentary writer - a bit abstract, and pure contemporary."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I purchased a set of counter height bar stools and I am very pleased with the quality of the product. Easy assembly, comfortable and a great product at a great price. Very satisfied."
3,"Great Collection, Sub-Standard Packaging","I love Kubrick. I managed to snag this great set while it was on sale. My only (and I do mean only) complaint was that the packaging seems prone to breakage. When I received my copy there were many floating pieces inside the container. I managed to fix it with super glue, and I rip all of my originals to disk so I can watch a backup copy so my quick fix should be fine, but I would have liked to have seen better or more robust packaging."
4,Great collection pack,"For all the kubrick Lovers: it's a must buy!great size, great looking and of course, the blu-ray quality that's just breathtaking (2001... looks awesome!).I think the only ""but"" that I founded was the discs storage system, because feels like your are going to damage the blu-ray.Anyway, I'm really happy with the product!"
5,Fine Service,"This product arrived in a timely fashion. It's a great set of films that span kubrick's entire career. Great for lovers of his stints in more commercial genres, like the epic Spartacus, or the literary period piece Barry Lyndon. A number of great movies at a comparatively low price."
5,Awesome Collection,"My son wants to study film in college and asked for this collection for Christmas. We've gone through each movie in order and I'm continually amazed at Kubrick's scope of work throughout the decades. He runs the gambit of period pieces from ""Spartacus"" to ""Barry Lyndon"". Each film has it's own perspective and unique vision of the time--""A Clockwork Orange"" is a groovy trip to the '60's!! I had forgotten what a masterpiece ""2001"" was as well. Full Metal Jacket, Lolita,The Shining were all given the Kubrick treatment. A MUST have for anyone interested in his work from the early '60's on up. The closed captioning works well for each film, as does the extras available. The digital restorations are magnificent. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a visual treat that jumps off the screen. The story might be dull but the scenery sure isn't!Makes a great gift."
4,"GREAT set, but yes, the packaging is very bad","Beautiful transfers, great movies, great special features. Not much more that can be said about that.But I do have to agree about the packaging. I am not usually fussy or picky about that kind of thing, but this is a really bad design. The discs are tightly wedged into the sleeves and you have no choice but to grab the disc by the edge to yank it out. You can't reach the center circle, you have to touch the actual disc and pull firmly. It is nearly impossible to do without smudging the disc or worse. The packaging looks nice but is completely impractical.So 1 star off a 5 star collection of movies due to terrible package design."
4,Repeating previous review..,"The parchment paper is great - a little too big but not a problem. I believe it has 100 sheets, something that wasn't mentioned online. It was a good deal but postage from Canada was almost as much as the order. I would check around more next time. Maybe it would be less in the states. I would also choose a size closer to my pan size."
1,not so great,"Do not like this product. it is not as thick as the brand I have gotten from King Authur Flour. Things still stick and seep through to the pan below causing the paper to stick and then you have to scrub the pan (which is the point of using the parchment, so it's easier to wash and no sticking!)"
3,Parchment Sheets,"Very thin poor quality and not grease proof or silicone treated. It is useable ,however I am still looking for something comparable to the sheets I have used for many many years. I tried this product because I was able to have it delivered, and I was running very low on my current sheets. The company I have used for many years, moved , making it very inconvenient to obtain the sheets, since they don,t deliver.I am only able to make one sheet of cookies at a time- sheets get very greasy. Not as cost effective as I had hoped."
2,Not impressed,I just received my parchment paper and it came rolled up. I purchased this because it was sheets and thought I was going to receive them laying flat. Now it is going to be difficult for me as a pastry chef to be able to make paper cornets and to line pans without the corners rolling up. All in all it was a waste of money and i will not be purchasing this product again.
1,Way too expensive!,"I do a lot of baking, I purchased this item thinking it was a good price but when I received it there were only about 25 sheets in the pack. What a ripoff! I ordered the exact same thing from King Arthur Flour Company on Amazon and got 100 sheets for $19.00."
4,Mehul: less insipid than Mozart,All classical music is not as insipid as Mozart. Mehul's orchestration is much more sophisticated and much less formulaic.
4,"Quality product. Comprehensive, but, many courses still not listed","Good quality product. But, did not provide info on many of the smaller courses I had hoped would be reviewed."
3,Not good condition,"I ordered a text book that included worksheets throughout each chapter. The book was listed in ""GOOD"" condition but when it arrived, the cover was a little worn, but looked ok. However when I looked through it, almost all of the worksheets throughout the book were already filled in, and lots of the pages were written on. Considering the amount of writing in this book, I would not have labeled it ""GOOD"" condition. For only about 30% more, I could have gotten a brand new, updated edition. Guess I have a different idea of what GOOD condition is. Shipping was fine. (BTW, many of the answers that were filled in weren't even right!)"
5,Lab Exercises,"Very good book, a lot of information for a lab book. It helps not to carry around the text all the time but it is very detailed."
4,Very Entertaining,"As a lifelong South Philly resident and Philadelphia Phillies fan I have to admit this book really hits a home run. I recommend all baseball fans pick up a copy. The finale will make the hairs on your head stand up. Greg is an ""all-star"" in my book !"
2,fine if you have money to travel,"i wasn't expecting this book to be in this form when i bought it. this would be great if one was on a world tour from california to sweden to italy then china, but for those of us who drink beer within 10 miles from home, it's a dissapointment and essentially useless, as he gives reviews of specific breweries i've never heard of."
4,A fun book about the bond of sisterhood,"I finished this book in 2 days, which is quick for me as I'm a slow reader but I really couldn't put it down. It was punchy and had well written dialog between the sisters that showed each of their personalities fairly distinctly. There were a couple places I was not convinced with the story line between Emily and Jake and the theme might have been too heavy handed at times. Overall though a cute piece of fiction that was a breezy and enjoyable read, I'll read more of her."
3,Good ... But,"These are both musically good ragas. However, the miking and sound of the tabla is all wrong. For as particular as Zakir is about sound during his performances, I'm sure this one slipped past his QA. The tabla just sounds too distant. Disappointing for Nimbus too."
4,Folding rear basket,Harde to attatch to the bike. Actually painful. The basket is difficult to opening when needed but I assume it will ease as time goes on.I would not choose the white again as I think it will peel off eventually.Functional deisign and does the job.Took A little longer than expected to arrive.
5,Wrist Perch for your Keyboard,"I have been using the Rubbermaid Wrist Perch for about 20 years and I love it!!! It's the best thing I have ever used for underneath my keyboard. When I finally found it again at TNT Deals, Inc. I ordered two!!! I never want to be without it! And TNT Deals is an awesome company.... I received it within a couple of days! And it is exactly the same as the one I bought 20 years ago!! Can't go wrong with this item or this company!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Nine years ago when I was still a teenager, I obtained this book from my late Parish Priest in Yola, Nigeria. Hardly had I started reading it when I realised it was speaking to me as a person. Nouwen's introduction to the life of the Desert Fathers and the role Silence, Solitude and Prayer can have on our lives is thought provoking. This book has affected me in the most positive of ways. It is for everyone, for those busy with work, for those who go to Church, for those who frequent the bars...evreyone. This book would introduce a peaceful and calm spirituality to you - I highly recommend it and would not hesistate to give it a 10 star!!"
3,ok,"Nice plesent latin jazz from great players. The songs are well-written, and have decent hooks here and there, but the slick, modern production weighs this down. I listened a few times and it seems like generic background music, but if the album grows on me i'll revist Vertical's Currency"
2,left wanting more....,"I bought hed.pe's first album back in early '98 and it was an incredible CD. Each song had a unique sound and there was a certain element to each song that didn't make them boring. On the first CD it's like you never got comfortable in each song, but that's what made them great, they weren't predictable. They were aggressive and raw. With ""Broke"" hed.pe has slipped into making music that is more likable for the masses, which is fine, but I feel in the process they lost a lot of their edge. I want to compare their decline to Incubus's, but not as drastic or as sad. The one song on Broke that hints to their first album is ""Stevie"" which I think is the key track on an otherwise mediocre album. Honestly, do yourself a favor and buy the self titled album first for a ""knock you to the ground"" experience.On a side not, for Incubus, only buy S.C.I.E.N.C.E., it won't disappoint. Every other album is watered down and boring."
5,Great CD,"With expression, mixes between metal, rap, and more cultural music styles, (hed)P.E. created an ingenius album. from the opener ""killing time"" to the finish ""The Meadow"" it (in my mind) has no weak points. Like some of you though, I did, at one point, not like ""Pac Bell"" but after giving it a few chances it became an awsome song.Ya just don't skip a song because at first glance its not what you want it to be, you have to be more open minded than that. I enjoy this album and blast it all the time. This is one of the Metal/Rap bands that earns its originality points, because it really doesn't sound like everything else. People say that alot about bands, but this one puts in another type of vibe. Its somthing to relate to, like all albums should be, and its open with feelings and everything. It is a great album and I suggest buying it."
4,great video,I'v seen his video clips on youtube and had to get the DVD. The clean version of this DVD is really not needed. He's funny and generally not vulgar. I hear worse language walking through Walmart. I'd recomend this DVD to anyone.
4,TALENTED PERSON,HIS SHOW IS GREAT A LTTLE OFF COLOR BUT NO MORE THAN NORMAL DAY CONVERSATIONS ON TV BUT THE MINI VIDEO OF JEFF MAKING THE DUMMY SHOWS OFF HIS REAL TALENTS
5,Funny,"This Jeff Dunham is amazing...I was rolling on the ground laughing.The laughter was non-stop, start to finish...."
5,Great Video : Jeff Dunham - Spark of Insanity,Great video. I laughed so much that my belly and my cheeks were hurting.
5,Hysterically funny!,My family and I laughed so hard we were in tears! Very talented comedian/ventriloquist. I hope Jeff comes to our state soon!!
5,Love this guy(s)!,"Jeff Dunham is hysterical! This show gets better every time I watch! I walked around for days saying ""Silence...I kill you!!!"" I love Achmed - he cracks me up.This is a great video to pop in when you're having a bad day or down in the dumps - it will definitely cheer you up!"
5,very funny,Very entertaining. Jeff Dunham has hit his comedic stride and it's well documented in this perfomance video. Memorable characters and some classic lines. Even my grumpy Walter-like dad commented that he like it!
5,A night of laughs,I had heard a lot about Jeff Dunham and how funny he is. A friend of mine happened to have this video and let me borrow it. I have never laughed so hard in my life! I immediately logged on to Amazon to order it for my brother-in-law for Christmas. A must see!
3,Sophmore Curse?,"Though his stand up is still very good the overall flow of the characters seemed forced and still rough. Not nearly as good as his first (Arguing with Myslef) but had it's moments. However, he still shows great skill as a ventriloquist so I hope his next effort will be much better. Not much of a spark here..."
5,Peanut is the man!,"Love this show! I think Jeff Dunham is a really funny guy. This CD is one laugh after another, and goes by way too fast! A must for all comedy collections!"
5,Soooo Funny!!!!,"Why isn't this guy more famous ???? He's been around for years, is fresh and unique, and just gets better and better. An excellent sequel to Arguing With Myself !!"
4,Spark of Hilarity,"This is a great DVD. You have probably seen some of it if you watch Comedy Central, but a few things are new. We watched this on Christmas when the family was over and everyone who wasn't passed out from too much turkey was rolling with laughter. One neat feature is that you can switch between your favorite characters, or watch the entire show straight through."
1,Jeff Dunham is Awful,This was the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen. I feel as though my IQ has dropped 10 points from watching it.
4,Entertaining DVD!,This is very entertaining. Not for kids because of topics and some of the language. Not as good as his Arguing with Myself DVD but definitely worth watching. Jeff is an amazing ventriloquist!
3,Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity,This video is surely funny but in my opinion it is not as funny as Jeff Dunham: Arguing with myself. However it is classic Jeff Dunham and is worth watching.
2,Not good audio,"The content of this video was as good as we expected, but the audio was terrible. We had the sound almost at the highest level & had difficulty hearing a lot of funny stuff without straining. The audience volume was too high & drowned out the clarity of Dunham's voice. I do hope they correct this. He is very funny!"
5,Spark Of Insanity,The funniest standup comic I have seen in a long time. Everyone that sees it tells me that it is great and I still get a tears from laughter in my eyes after seeing this DVD 4 times.Sensational!!
4,Spark of Insanity aptly named,Jeff Dunham is extremely funny. His humor may not be for everyone. His unique way of expressing his outlook on life is second to none. I especially found it easy to relate to Walter
5,Excellent,This is a great DVD. I enjoy Jeff Dunham. I wish there were more DVD's out. He is fantastic.
5,Definitely a keeper,"I have never seen my daughter laugh so hard! She was actually rolling on the floor with tears running down her face; she finally asked me to stop the DVD before she wet herself. I know, too much information, but it was that good."
5,HILARIOUS,I cried from laughing so hard at this DVD. I can't wait for future DVDs from Jeff Dunham and his gang.
5,A LESSON FOR ALL OF US TO LEARN,THIS BOOK HAS THE HEART OF A WOMAN IN A DREAM FOR THE LOVE OF HER SON. IT WILL GIVE TEENAGERS AS WELL AS ADULTS A VIEWPOINT OF WHAT ITS LIKE WHEN THEY TURN TO THE STREETS FOR COMFORT. I ENJOYED DETAILS OF VARIOUS ACCOUNTS IN WHAT HAS HAPPEN WITHIN HER LIFE AND THE COURAGE THAT SHE HAS GAINED FOR TRUSTING IN GOD. I GREATLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL AGES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE LOST A LOVE ONE BY VIOLENCE.
2,Epson is better,"A long time fan of the Epson Glossy Photo paper, I found it harder to buy in bulk. Reviews for the HP were very good so I tried. I can't wait till it's used up. It's thinner stock than the Epson which feels flimsy for a photo. HP prints their name on the back in black lettering which is sometimes seen through the image. Finally, I'm not wowed by the look, it just seems a bit flat."
5,good value,"I am not a good judge of photo papers. That said, I think this paper was cheap enough. I started making posters for my kids from copy paper, but using the photo paper was a huge improvement. My printer is Canon MX870. I use after market ink from Carrot ink."
2,flawed production,"We ordered this particular season and volume because the one we had borrowed from my sister we thought had been damaged and wanted to replace it. It is ""damaged"" in the exact same two places as the one from my sister. Episode 18 and 21 are all scattered, distorted, freeze or blank. Like it was not done right at the time of making the CD. The same, identical flaw was in the one we had borrowed and she had bought it years ago. Very disappointing..MGM is responsible for this lack of quality and not the person who sent it via you. thank you."
2,whats da deal,"man, what is dis crap!!! we all know mike jones spits da same stuff everytime, magnificient is a sidekick, paul wall is losing it, and slim thug is just trying to get paid. swisha house needs to regroup and get some mo playas as i see it, but da beats go hard though."
4,A classic for serious students of the recorder,"First, please do realize that recorders can be serious instruments; there are virtuoso players worldwide, and the American Recorder Society (in the USA, of course) is an organization worth learning about (at least).This book is one of several that a serious student would do well to acquire. Being written by Britons, its terminology differs slightly; their ""descant"" is our soprano, and their ""treble"" is our alto.It's apparently been in print for decades; my copy is dated 1961. Guess that qualifies it as a classic!Fwiw, I'm no expert, but did want to help by offering some information about it."
3,I liked it but...,"I have read the entire series and I enjoyed reading the series as a whole. But while I was reading something kept bothering me about the series. It appears to tell readers that the main characters who were left behind were either not Christian enough or not good enough. This is completely unbiblical in that you cannot be good enough or Christian enough. The Bible says ""Be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect."" That is the standard. Scripture also tells us to repent of our sins and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved."
3,Apocalypse night,"The book was pretty well written. It goes along the lines of the Left Behind series, but having read the series so long ago, I could not connect the event from each book. I was unable to keep my interest up, though. Maybe it was just not something I was in the mood for at that time."
2,Novel made me frown,"One of the hallmarks of Chuck Pahlaniuk's writing style is to establish a few gimmicky writing contraptions in the first chapter and then build a plot around these repeating structures.In Pahlaniuk's best works, like Fight Club and Lullaby, these repeating motifs add to the storyline and repetition drives home subtle points about each. But in Diary, I found these structures -- repeated faco-muscular descriptions, the constant second person reference to Peter Wilmot as You, and the emotional weather descriptions -- to be more of a distraction rather than an aide to the plot.And the plot is rather thin. The ending left me cold. I felt like I wasted my time. This book is all mood and smoke, dreamy, disconnected ideas and gimmicks, and not much else."
3,Chuck P's Diary,I didn't enjoy this. I love Palahniuk but this one isn't like is usual stuff. It's wriiten as journal entries (hence the title 'Diary') and can be hard to get into.
2,Reasons for not writing books to a metronome,"I seriously cannot finish this book.Either there are a lot more people reading novels now who have attention deficit issues, or this book is the most repetative, nagging dead weight I have ever looked at. Now, I've read plenty of CP, and this has been clearly forming over the years; the little repeat sentence tags (""A couple of drinks. A couple of asprin. Repeat."" Yeah, repeat is right. Try every paragraph.) are certainly his writing style and his alone, but how much can we take? How many times can you write the same novel over and over?I am fairly sure that if you can find the beat rhythm the book was written to, you'll be able to read it back at the same beat, like a limmerick."
2,Beach Reading,"Although replete with all the shuddering visual images you'd expect from a Palahniuk novel, this story strayed too far into the formulaic, lazily concluding with an over-used literary device. Easy to read and more entertaining than many, this may be a better book to read on the beach in an alcohol-induced haze than as a compelling, original work of literature."
2,Didnt even finish it,"Maybe I shouldnt be writing this review because I havent finished the book but thats also why Im deciding to write a review.I love Chuck Palahniuk novels, I usually finish them in a matter of days. I was extremely excited when I heard he had a new book out and bought it as soon as it was released. However the story was uninteresting and it was hard to read and become involved. I tossed the book in the trunk of my car and 9 months later found it and said ""oh, there it is"". I havent started to read it yet and that was almost a month ago.I have read all his other books and I have to say I think they are getting worse with each one. ""Lullabye"" had been my least favorite until ""Diary"". I am more interested in reading a science book than I am in rereading the 100 or so pages Ive already put into this.Very dissapointing."
3,I kept thinking,"Agreeing with many who reviewed this, I wanted to love this book; I came in with high expectations, even though his last book was an enormous bummer for me. I found this to a transitional story. The CP of Fight Club is disappearing. His novels have moved to more intimate territory, which is quite good, but never great, and not yet fully satisfying. As for the reviewers who felt they were reading the same chapter over and over again, read the book one more time, slowly. The major difference here from CP's other work, is this is not a book that is designed to be torn through; it demands attention in a way the others didn't. If you haven't tried CP yet, or if you have and are iffy based on what you read last, try this. It is not a great book (and the ending would have been stronger without the final portion, but don't look ahead!), but it is an indication that the next one, if the transition in CP's writing themes holds, the next one will be."
2,Awesome read with AWFUL ending,"I read this novel in 2003 and still haven't been able to forget it. I was totally engrossed from the get-go. I kept reading, blown away because this was truly the most original novel I had ever come across. It was simply the best book I had ever read. UNTIL about three quarters of the way in. I kept telling myself that there was no way that a writer who had come up with something so unique would choose to head in such a conventional, boring, predictable, disappointing, etc, etc, direction. I kept dreading every word that brought me closer to the last page for fear that my gut was right.I made it to the last page. Flung the book across the room. And vowed never to read anything from the author ever again."
2,"Good writing, poor plot","As a big fan of Mr. Palahniuk, I was sadly dissapointed with Diary. To me, it was worth buying and reading since he is my favorite author, but I wouldn't recommend it to those who are not die hard Chuck fans."
2,inane depressing with sprinkes and whipped cream,"exactly, what a bunch of nonsense... listen, I'll deal with a Turturro's crazy cinematic lunacy - but ole Chucky boy is plenty of cards short of a full deck - I was hoping Peter would wake up from his coma and kill Misty and his mother - this book nearly put me in a coma - STAY AWAY from Wantanasaey or whatever island. the book and the island should be condemned!"
2,A Waste of Time,"This story begins with a great plot idea that goes nowhere. The prosse is brilliantly structured, but the contents are simply a bore. I've read Fight Club and Survivor and loved both. Though I'm totally disapointed in this novel, I like what Palahniuk is about as a writer so I'll give his other books a chance and hope that this one was just a fluke."
3,all great is art is made through suffering,"My first Palahniuk bookThis book is okay.I felt that it was going somewhere,& the things discussed in it were very interesting.particularily parts in which Misty was imprisoned at the hospital, forced to draw blindfolded. I think Mr. Palahniuk really knows how it feels to be an artist, cause it truly is like bearing your soul. But as the book went on, i felt as if it was very rushed & it expected me to believe what was going on way too quickly. Maybe iam just too much of a realist or im bad suspending my disbelief, but it was hard for me to believe in what was going on. Other than that, once again, i felt that Palahniuk has alot to say, & isnt afraid to think ""outside the box"". Which is always refrshing.After this book, i went on to Invisible Monsters, which in my opinion, is much better."
2,All others a 5,"Very disappointing from a writer who has brought us some brilliant books. I love all of Chuck Palahniuk's other work, but this book was hurried and poorly written. For fans of Palahniuk, stick to Survivor and Lullaby."
2,Diary failed to impress.,"Perhaps it was my fault for reading two novels consecutively by the same author. After enjoying Lullaby, I just could not see what made this book unique. Palahniuk's style shocked at first, but a book driven solely on the visceral fails to hold attention after the initial reaction has expired. Palahniuk pounds the narrator's emotion into print, chapter after chapter, but the story itself had little to say. The wealthy capitalists are manipulative and hollow... we get it, Chuck. Art derives from pain... we get it, Chuck. I found myself frustrated that I'd been taken on a very indirect rout to nowhere."
2,disappointing and tedious,"As a Palahniuk fan, this novel disappointed me to no end. At no point while I was reading it was I interested. It was just plain boring; the main character was self-pitying and annoying and all the other characters lacked depth. I am usually a quick reader but this book took me forever to get through. The whole experience was downright painful and unfortunately I cannot start a book without finishing it. I know that Palahniuk's claim to fame is his simplistic and minimalistic writing style and in most of his other novels it works, but in this one alot of his lines are just redundant. I feel like I'm stuck in one chapter throughout the whole novel. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this book."
1,Bypass,"I first heard of Palahniuk when he was the coverboy for Poets & Writers magazine a few years ago. They asked him to recommend some writers, and one name he mentioned was Jo Ann Beard. Take my advice, read Jo Ann Beard if you like good writing. The fans of Chuck Palahniuk are guys who wear yellow sunglasses. The world doesn't need more Palahniuk right now."
1,A quick read for a rainy day...but not good for much else.,"As if the blatant references to ""Rosemary's Baby"" and even the NBC TV movie ""Bay Coven,"" which starred Susan Rutan of ""LA Law"" fame, weren't enough! Does Palahniuk really need to add to the mix a lapsed Thomas Kinciad-esque painter/single mother who goes out of her way to ignore obvious signs of sketchiness? If you can forgive the author his lame-brained life insurance policy scheme, an unexplained father in law, a ""heroine"" with a penchant for gaudy costume jewelry, and other simplistic plot/character devices, this book might be for you. But don't think too hard...the story completely falls apart if you give it a second thought. At best--and at worst--its an amateurish look at materialism/consumerism through the eyes of yet another (potentially) unreliable narrator."
2,"So Slow, So Pointless.","I also really like the other Chuck Palahniuk books I've read, including Survivor, Choke, and Invisible Monsters. Diary, however, is so so so tedious to get through. Palahniuk is good at interesting descriptions and novel ways of repeating themes throughout his books, but here, he forgets to engage us with any real plot. The book tries to build to some seemingly momentous finish, but ultimately fizzles in the last chapter. With so many great books in existence, skip this, or at least read it last if you're a Palahniuk groupie."
1,Music that tells a strory...,"I purchased this CD after seeing Iyanla on an Oprah show which showcased a few songs from this CD. The music is good, however, Iyanla talks too much, she should let the Music Tell the Story."
3,"I love Iyanla in person, I liked the book","In the Meantime had a style that was hard to read. It was worth it though to get a few powerful insights. Overall, what got me through the book was my memory of how inspirational Iyanla is in person. I am anxious to read another book to see if her power is conveyed somewhere. I have a feeling that workshops and talks are the places to really get blown away by Iyanla."
2,In the Meantime,"This book started out good and really made sense and was positive but eventually, it got a little ""out there"". For instance, when she was giving an example of a couple who had a long-term relationship and one of them wasn't sure about how he felt and wanted to see other people, her advise was that the person who knew for sure about how he/she felt about the relationship should trust the other enough to let him/her do whatever they need to do to find out, as long as they stay together and supposedly, that's building love and trust. To me, it's saying, ""I'm a doormat...walk on me."" or can we say the word CODEPENDENT tendencies? BEEN THERE, DONE THAT!! And thank goodness, I'm far into my codependent recovery so as to recognize this; therefore, not buying into it. In the end, I just took what I could use from the book and left the rest but there was a lot left."
4,Not Your Average Compilation,"Definitely impressive how the different artists flow togother; and in turn the music is not choppy (which is not the case in other recent compilations i have heard). Who else in this world would have thought to make a soundtrack to a book?!?!? Not to mention an equally inspiringing book. This woman is truely blessed with good vibes and it rubbed off on me when I listened the album. This is a breath-of-fresh-air and is a definite must-have for fans of soul,rhythm and blues,gospel, or hip-hop music."
1,Book never received!,This book apparently was lost in the mail....It was never received by me so i cant really rate it.very dissapointed.
5,In the Meantime...,My Mom loves this book! She said it has helped her with her troubles in life. I hope everyone will read this book.
2,"Married with kids, after reading, expect a divorce","I don't deny the fact that this book was helpful in allowing people in casual unhealthy relationships to take a closer look at their situations. I do however, feel that things change when you are married, have kids and have a firm believe in your wedding vows. No doubt this book gets you thinking about yourself and helping yourself, but I believe it falls short in re-enforcing a commitment that people have when they get married and bring children into the world."
4,Almost indestructible.,"Very comfortable work boots. I work in industrial maintenance so im usually pretty hard on them. The only problems i've seen out of them was the shoe strings and pads on the inside eventually weary out, but that can be replaced cheaply. The leather and stitching is quality though."
4,Well made and reliable.,"I've had this for about 6 years now, and this oven has proven to be dependable. The temperature is accurate. (Very important and sorely lacking in other brands, even more expensive models) It's slightly larger capacity allows you to cook smaller casseroles. This oven looks and feels like ""quality"", a notch above the standard fare. I don't like the dial handle for toasting, though. It is awkward. I'm planning to buy the newer ""retro"" model, a stainless steel eye-catcher, and I noticed they rectified the awkward knobs on this model."
3,Just okay.,"This is a toaster oven of considerable size, which it turns out is its major feature. It is not particulary well made (fit and finish is only fair). The end of cycle bell is a bit weak and the door seal is imperfect. Aside from this, it's pretty good, but it is an awfully expensive toaster oven. For a lot less, an equally serviceable toaster oven can bought readily from Amazon (. . .) However, for a little more, a Delonghi convention unit can be had, and that adds a whole new dimension to toaster oven cooking."
2,Too Much Dialog,"I have every one of Tanya Huff's books. This was one of the more disappointing. She has a great premise, but wastes way too much time on terrible dialog between characters when she needs something to happen. The ending was predictable, the plot standard. Nothing at all new in this. Her previous book was awesome, the Shadowlord premise was great, and that would also make a great new series. This one needs some work. Cut some of the dialog, add some action. The dialog slows down the events in the story to a crawl"
1,No video out,"Got no video to display on any of my televisions. My mac book recognizes the adapter, but not s-video or composite video on the tv. Tried different cables as well."
3,not my cup of leche,"True flamenca with lots of vocals... too much. Interesting, but too loud. But that's okay.I prefer the soft, intricate, instrumental side of Flamenca and would recommend (5 stars)Azahara... an remarkable recital of guitar virtuousity."
4,Great value,"This is a great watch for the price, wonderful for my son and provides enough options to get the job done."
1,piece of crap,"this product is supposed to be water resistant it says on the back of the watch) , but guess what? the first use in a swiming pool it broke! i cant give it back becuase im from south america and i buy things from amazon in an international mailbox. This product is just not worth it."
5,Timex Ironman,I have had the watch for a couple weeks now and it is great! For the price you cannot beat it. I have had three of these types of watches and I have yet to every see a better one for under $100.
1,Caveat Emptor,"This has been a most disappointing product. I've used heart rate monitors for years, generally from Polar. I bought the Timex because the battery is readily replaceable. Unfortunately, the heart rate monitor has never worked reliably. When I first start the monitor, it shows an accurate heart rate. However, after about 5-10 minutes of exercise, the rate inexplicably drops far below what is real. Timex has sent me two replacement chest bands, which produced the same results as the original. I think the watch is defective; Timex insists that if it registers a heart beat at all, it can't be defective. It's back to Polar for me!"
4,No problems,"I enjoy the watch. Everything is easy to figure out, except I keep wanting the front button to turn the light on.I would buy this again."
3,Timex Ironman Triathlon T53151 Comments,"Granted I've had this watch for only a month, but was prompted to write this review, so what the heck. So far this watch has been everything I could ask for. Easy to view, easy to program, accurate, practical, nice light which illuminates for 4 secs. Play tennis with it on, as it is relatively light weight, and not a distraction. Solid value, and may have to raise the score after a couple months. Order process w/Amazon was a cake walk, very good experience."
4,funny,"a fun read all in all and for everyone who fell in love with becky in the best first book it's a worthwhile sequel. becky once again loses control of her finances and her life, this time in new york. and sometimes it's hard to feel sorry for her because it is a self-inflicted, but there aren't many of us who can say we haven't erred in judgement in front of a good sample sale. what can get annoying is how often she loses control - it gets old after awhile. but, despite everything crashing around becky she still has a good heart and manages to pick up and stand up for herself, which is why she is endearing."
4,Actually 3 1/2 Stars...,"Sophie Kinsella has a flair for comedic writing. Becky Bloomwood, the main character in the Shopaholic books is at it again. She's successful, has a boyfriend, and manages to repeat the cycle of a true addict. Join Becky on her adventure on a trip to Manhattan. If you enjoy shopping at all, you'll drool at the different places she visits. Becky's antics get her into some Bridget Jones-esque trouble, and the laugh factor is high. You'll sympathize with Becky, you'll want to shake her, you'll cry with her, and you'll be proud of her in this successful sequel. I don't think it's quite as good as the first, however, it's still a great book. There is nothing better than shopping and reading about shopping, at least in my opinion, so this book rates well in my book. If you enjoyed Confessions of A Shopaholic, you'll be certain to enjoy this one!"
5,Better than the 1st--Lots of Luke!,"I really love Luke Brandon. He's always so ""amused"" by Becky. They are such a cute couple. The best part of the book? When Becky calls Luke's mother a horrible COW!!"
5,She does it again . . .,"This is a great follow up to her first book - Confessions of a Shop-o-holic. This book is witty and fun. The main character gets herself into so much trouble, but it's fun to watch her get her way out of it. I highly recommend this book as well as her first one too."
5,Light and fun Summer read,The book arrived in great condition. The book was light and fun to read. My 18 year old daughter grabbed it and read all in one night. I enjoyed it as much as she!
4,Shop for this book!,"... If you have ever written a check that bounced, tried to charge something on a card that was over the limit or worried about bills you pretended didn't exist but persist on coming to your doorstep each month, this book will make you giggle in delight. It stars the penniless but charming Rebecca Bloomwood. She's a financial advice guru who is in debt up to her eyeballs but can't pass a store without going in and buying something. I have to say this book had me laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes and was glad that Rebecca was still struggling with her incessant need to shop after the fairy-tale happy ending of the first novel. (I was worried she'd turn into a nonshopper!!!) Thankfully she's back with more wacky antics. Buy this book or pick it up at the library, it's too funny to miss!"
4,"More serious, just as riveting","This is the sequel to the Confession of a Shopaholic series. Is it as good? While it is not as funny, the problems Becky grapple with are more serious, as is her relationship with Luke, which makes it acceptable not being as funny as the first since Becky's problems in the first book would seem trivial compared to what she deals with here. So it is still a page turner seeing her try to overcome her disasters and salvage her relationship. Sophie Kinsella's talent is truly in creating fascinating characters and I found myself drawn deeper into the existing characters as well as the new ones. They were well fleshed and make you care for them. The writing remain flowy and the ending was perfect - another book you can't put down until the last page. Again, I would vote this one of the better chick lits out there and I am very picky about my chick lits!"
2,That is one fun and kicky mental illness!!,"Beckly Bloomwood suffers from obsesssive compulsive disorder. She is addicted to impulse buying the way some are addicted to narcotics. She hides the extent of her shopping to her loved ones. Her shopping has caused her financial problems. She can't stop after a little shopping...you get the idea. Except that for the intents and purposes of this book, it's way to spree-shop on all those lux brands vicariously. Like reading about food without gaining an ounce! The actual sadness of mental illness doesn't come into play here because that would be such a downer, woudn't it. No, Becky is so cute and charming and winsome about her addiction that lucky breaks save her day...again! Wow. What luck. It's like having anorexia just to the extent where you're really, really thin, but not to the extent that your bones crumble and your body starts eating itself."
4,Tame opening...but ends up quite happily cheerfully...,"Well, it was slow to begin. Nothing really happens until she bought a Vera Wang cocktail dress at Barneys. And then, things start happening...A fight with Luke, The Daily World's report to reveal Becky's spending habit, and the consequences of that news...some sentiments and a delightful surprise at the ending. I am now puzzled with Lalla's e-mail comment saying ""...your news--congratulations!""... Is this suggesting Becky and Luke getting married???"
2,"Oh, No! Please, Becky! Stop being so stupid and put it down!","I made it through reading the first Shopaholic book all alright. I suppose that's only because I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The second book, while just as entertaining as the first, made me scream and have the strong desire to slap Becky Bloomwood even moreso than the first. Once I got past that initial reaction towards that character, it only seemed to get worse. Becky's stupidity and lack of self-control made me take the book back to the library mostly unread."
5,amazing,This book is amazing. Both of the shopoholic books are adictive. Once you start reading them you are unable to put them down. I can not wait until the new book in the series comes out!!! I highly recommend this book to anyone!!!
3,Good product but no service.,"Bought one of these last Christmas and it did a nice job but the steamer quit working. It has been in the shop for about two months now, most of that time waiting for Delonghi to send the repair part. The shop says it is not unusual to have problems getting parts from them. I will never buy another Delonghi product."
2,not worth it,"this is a decent coffee maker, although over priced. the top part where you pour the water in is really small, so be ready with a towel...and dont ever break the carafe, you will never, ever find a replacement!"
5,good coffee,We have been very happy with our new coffee maker. It makes a great cup of coffee. The only thing we were unhappy with was that there were no good directions for making cappuccino or flavored cappuccio's like mocha cappuccino. I guess you have to experiment.
1,Poorly Made,"I was very disapointed with this Window, The Glass kept falling out, because the frame was to large. I was having it installed by my contractor,and he had to go to town and buy another window to install.Capt Tom Stone"
5,Positive experience,"The item arrived in time. No fault noticed, and item appears to be exactly as described. This item was really useful for class, so I was very happy when I found it here. Price is reasonable as well. A positive experience."
3,Answer Key to Al-Kitaab Fil Ta'allum,"Very good, but perhaps would be better in the dialect I am learning.So, it is a little more complicated for me."
3,"Useful, but not what I hoped for.","As I shared my struggle to return to my Faith a counselor at my church gave me this book to read. While I appreciate the teachings, they are entirely of the preemptive kind. What I had hoped for was a book that addressed the harsher and more brutal problems that can face one on the walk of life in a more intimate and hands on manner, Turn It To Gold is not that kind of book. Still, for preparing for the inevitable hardships of life, this book will prove useful in its warm and fuzzy way."
3,subpar instrumentalists,"While the music is beautiful, some of the orchestral and instrumental performances leave much to be desired, and I would consider them to be second-rate"
3,Don't Stop Believin' - The Untold Story Of Journey,"Its ""good"" book, but not great book. If you don't know anything about the story behind Journey's success, then this book is for you. If you do, then probably already know everything in this book.I would have liked to see him cover the following in more detail...1) Why Steve Perry's 2nd Album ""Against The Wall"" was not released.2) Perry's refusal to participate in the recording of the new songs, (""With aTear"" and ""Into Your Arms""), for the 1992 box set Time 3.3) The failed 93/94 Reunion attempt with Kevin Chalfant.4) Finally the reasons why Gregg Rolie wasn't included any of the reunions afterthe 93/94 attempt... (1996 Trail By Fire reunion or 1998 reunion or even nowwith Arnel Pineda)"
4,More Satisfying Mannheim Music,"Chip Davis and Co. have another great Fresh Aire on their (and our) hands. Varying styles, slow and up-tempo pacing, and always interesting. Nice to hear LSO on this disc. My only gripe is labeling the tracks on rear cover and disc. It would have been nice to have the multi-part tracks not jump numbers, so when you look to see what is playing the title matches with the track number on the player. Otherwise overall a great production... I guess I am not a purist in the extent I don't need the DVD to figure out the music and the direction it takes me...maybe it's because I have an interest in many forms of music (except rap, disco and [ugh!] country, and am not a music major; therefore my tastes are not jaded."
3,"Good CD, but sounds unfinished.","When I first got the album, I got this overwhelming feeling of emptiness from the CD. The thick CD jacket is full of interesting material but the album doesn't sound like it took 4 years to make. Fresh Aire 7 is by far a better album. Chip should have left the series alone after 7. In fact the more I listen to it the more annoying it gets. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out."
5,Phantom Stallion is a Great Series!!,"I have read the first thirteen of the Phantom Stallion series, and Free Again is one of my favorites. Like all the Phantom Stallion books, a lot of different story lines are presented throughout the book. You get to know not only the human characters, but also the horses, each of which have their own personality as well. I highly recommend the Phantom Stallion series for any horse lover!"
1,doesn't work,"this Cartridge (are-50), which the manufacturer says is compatible with T032120, doesn't work on epson C80 or C82 printers,don't waste your money and time on this product."
5,Terrific CD,This CD ROCKS! I bought the American version a long time ago. This is even better. The two bonuses and the hidden track make it all worthwhile!
1,Great Coffee-Bad Carafe Design,"Enjoyed this coffee maker for several weeks, one morning several minutes after pouring the coffee, we heard a pop from the coffee maker. A closer look showed coffee pouring out of the carafe. Further inspection showed that the carafe had imploded, the glass inner lining had cracked into a thousand pieces and coffee was leaking out everywhere. An email of the problem and concern to DeLonghi yielded no response."
1,does not grind fine enough,My 15.99 Regal blade grinder made better coffee. it simply does not grind fine enough.
3,Overkill for my purposes,"This is a fine grinder, but it may not suit everyone's lifestyle. As a single man who lives alone, this machine is overkill for me. It's cumbersome and time consuming to use and to clean. If you are grinding a pound of coffee at a time, this is a great machine; if you are grinding for a single four-pot coffee maker, it's a little tedious.So just like other appliances, there isn't a be-all-end-all, and I'm in the process of switching to a smaller and easier to use blade grinder."
2,"When it wears out, it's toast.","We used our grinder for about 18 months, then noticed that the coffee was not grinding as fine as we required. The burrs had worn down and when I contacted DeLonghi I was informed that they do not sell replacement burrs. So basically what we have here is a mechanical device with wearable parts for which the manufacturer does not supply a replacement. The motor is fine, the other parts are just peachy but the whole grinder is now landfill. What a waste! I will not buy another and hope you opt for a machine that is more environmentally sound."
2,No Espresso!,"This grinder does not produce evenly ground coffee, there is some fine powder, and some coarser coffee. Which is not too good for espresso. Also note, this grinder is mechanically identical to the Mister Coffee."
3,It works for espresso-but how long?,"I've had this grinder for a month. I got a fancy espresso machine, and din't want to pay big bucks for a grinder too. This grinder has worked for me, but required modification to grind fine enough for espresso - I had to file down the little plastic nub that limits how far you can move the fineness control. It was easy (like nothing), and did the job - I can grind fine enough to make a proper espresso, even too fine - enough to choke my espresso machine. My only question is: how long will it last?"
5,Filled with laughs,"The planning of Becky (and Luke's) wedding is one of the funniest stories you'll read this year. Her handling of meddling, but well intentioned mothers who are as different as night and day will leave anyone who's been in a similar situation crying with laughter. The amazing thing, though, is we know Becky will come out on top. It's the ride, how she gets there that's magic.Also good for laughs, a little book entitled No One's Even Bleeding."
3,"Shopaholic Collects Alimony? Good book, bad leading man","Okay, no one picks up a ""Shopaholic"" book looking for high lit. And Sophie Kinsella is much better at Bridget Jones clones than many other writers (I'm thinking of the truly terrible Jemima J., Bad Heir Day, etc.) This book is enjoyable, like the other two in the series. But I've got a major quibble: the hero, Luke, is really not very appealing, and in some ways, is about the least dreamy Dream Man I can think of. He's never around, he kowtows to his mother, and he and Becky seem to gloss over their problems with a laugh and wink, not any sort of even mildly realistic discussion. It's hard to see why anyone would want to marry him, so I guess this likeable, fluffy book doesn't go down as well as it should. Poor Becky! I hope the next book isn't ""Shopaholic Collects Alimony."""
5,Becky's at Barney's!!,"How appropriate for Becky to get a job at her mecca, Barney's! And a personal shoper to boot! I'm sure you can only imagine a Shopaholic's wedding plans........this third book in Kinsella's series about Becky Bloomwood finishes it off very well.Can't wait for Kinsella's next heroine!"
1,Never Received Item,"Ordered product from DVDLegacy and never received item ordered. After 4wks of waiting, I cancelled my order. Poor service and not happy ordering from DVDLegacy."
3,"I think the entire series was too hyped up, really--","It's nice, but not that great. I thought our heroine's theme song should actually be ""If Only I had a Brain"", from Wizard of Oz; Meg Cabot and Isabella Wolff could do better. And I keep feeling that she got her writing style directly from Bridget Jones' Diary, with a lot of shopping thrown in.But ""Shopaholic Ties the Knot"" is a better read than ""Confessions Of a Shopaholic"", which made me dislike Rebecca Bloomwood rather. The end part of ""Ties the Knot"" is really quite ingenious."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,I'm really wishing that Becky gets hit by a car or trapped in a burning building or something; she's an idiot and she deserves whatever bad things happen to her.
5,Reading is now as much fun as Shopping,"This book shows you that everything we women buy is an ""investment"". We can always used for later....or not. But who cares when you get it on sale, Right? That is what this book taught me. Most women will simply buy because its on sale or because we can use it down the road. It just shows how women really behave when they are on shopping mode. This book was so much that I could not put it down and so where the other two books.Reading Sophie Kinsella's books really is a lot of fun, almost more fun then shopping."
4,wow,oh my gosh. i literally get tired of this book after ten minutes... but then an hour later im DYING to start reading again. sophie you have yet created another irrististable book to add on to the series
4,Enjoyed this one as well,"I just love the story between Luke & Becky - I guess that's why I love this series so much. I admit that I get frustrated with Becky and her not picking which wedding she wanted to have. I'm not the type that has a problem with making decisions nor do I have a problem telling people how I feel, so I could not relate with her & her dilemma. BUT, I just love the person Becky is and the genuine love she has for Luke. I guess that's why (like everyone in the book) I can look past her stupid mistakes. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series (Sister) even though I know the reviews aren't that great. I have also ordered Shopaholic & Baby, which I'm sure will win my heart as well."
2,Contrary to what it portraits in the first few pages...,"It was really funny in the first few chapters. I bought it last summer before i travelled to Europe, and thought it'd be a good book to spend my 13+ hour flights (I live in Hong Kong). I brought it with me all over Europe, read until Ch.12 (there're 21). I'm usually quite fast at reading novels. (I can finish a Sidney Sheldon in 4 hours.) But as the story goes, it was getting less & less interesting, so it became my last resort - I only read it when I had absolutely nothing else to do.Being a shopaholic myself (I have 100+ pairs of Manolos), and having just got married, (I got married late 2001), I could identify myself with her.. but it soon became stupid more than funny. I got frustrated with her that I finally didn't bother to read on anymore. I think it could have been more funny if it stuck with those stupid things she did in order to buy what she wanted & to hide her new found treasures from her fiance."
5,This is my life!!,I cannot wait for this to come out either!!! I have read the other two and I swear I could have pretty much written them myself! As a young college shopaholic who went into debt and is now getting control over the whole financial thing I so relate to this character that it is actually kind of scary!!! This is a must read for anyone!!!
3,Been There Done That,"As a person who loved the first two of these books, this pains me to write this, but I wish I had not bought this one. I found the first two comical and a light easy FUN read. By the time I got to book three here, I found myself thinking WHO IS THIS STUPID? Becky's moronic ""everthing will work itself out attitude"" was more than I could stand for another book. I know you will say... but it's just a cute book, get over it. Well I'll stick to one and two..."
3,Becky really deserves what she gets!!!,"I would have given this book 3.5 if it was possible. I have read just 'Confessions of a shopaholic' before this one and i don't think i will read any more of this series, although both these books were entertaining and hard to put down, i was wondering whole time'How is she ever going to come out of this mess?' But I really had a hard time trying to understand Becky. I didn't like her. She sounded so shallow sometimes, I really felt like shaking her. And she was such a liar, she lied even when she didn't need to.Towards the end of both the books she was able to redeem herselves by doing something very unselfish which was a good thing but still i can't forget how she kept irritating me, throughout most of the book, with her obssession with branded clothes, shoes, scarfs, and just about everything that could be bought.I had a good time reading this book but Becky was simply too irritating sometimes."
4,Romantic and sweet.,"So much is happening in the world of Becky Bloomwood. Weddings surround Becky, as Luke ponders asking the big question. Before you know it, Becky is planning her own wedding. This book is hilarious, and I couldn't put it down. I'm hoping that Kinsella will write another book in this series. All in all, it's a must read for every ""Shopaholic"" fanatic!"
2,don't trust photo,The photo clearly shows spatulas in several sizes. You only get one. The metal handle is not very ergonomic or comfortable for grasping and stirring.
1,So bad it's comical,"Until my wife brought this toaster home from Target I didn't think it was possible to come up with such a poor toaster design. My gosh, humankind been designing toasters for generations. It has an attractive retro look and would go nicely in an Air Stream camper, but in the 6 months we've owned it I don't think I've made one decent slice of toast. They are either under, or over done. Part of the problem is that the control for ""doneness"" moves so easilly it's always getting jostled out of position. But the most unbelievalbe design flaw of all is that the slots for the toast are so deep you cannot remove the toast without digging it out with a fork or pulling up on the handle. Sometimes you have to rapidly jerk the handle up in hopes that toast jumps up high enough that you can grab it before it falls. It's all rather comical."
2,Disappointed big-time,"Received this as a gift from my husband. The appearance of the product does not make up for its inefficient cooking. I have used grand pappi fryer for 10 years and it holds more food than the 690 Delonghi. I have more control with the grand pappi as I can stir the fries around which will keep them from sticking together. The 690 will probably be better when it is used for a small amount of food or if I decide to use it without the basket. Just does not cook fries nearly as well as the Presto model I have owned. Anyway the only reason it gets 2 stars is that it is ""safe"" to use as compared to the presto model.All in all, go with the Presto line."
4,Best deep Fryer to own!,"This deep fryer is the BEST when it comes to clean up. The unit is well made and offers a built in drain. If you have a Fry Daddy or other unit, you know how much of a mess they can make when changing the oil. Well worth the money paid."
5,Great product,"We use this desk mounted (not using grommet) and it works great. You can move the monitor in any direction needed and it stays perfectly. We use it with two 22"" monitors. No problems, built well."
4,nice looking,I got this watch for my husband. He tried it on and could not get it over his hand. I was going to send it back but I thought we would try to get another band for it instead because it is a great looking watch. I don't wear a watch myself and did not know how the band works. The lady at Kohl's department store said the band was on the shortest link and she adjusted it and now he loves it. She also said the bands she had would not fit the shape of the watch. It is easy to set time and has a lot of features that are impressing. The watch did not include instructions for the band and when I ordered it I thought is would be a expansion bracelet that stretched. He never had one with a clasp before so if you think it is small try getting it adjusted.
5,Great all around watch!,"I had been looking for a metal digital watch for some time that was not ugly and had good functionality. This watch is all of those except the coloring on it could be a bit brighter (it's a bit dull). Anyway, you CAN adjust the bands and remove/put in links. I bought this at Walmart, and the lady did it right then and there for me. Poor lady: she kept on adjusting it and I kept on trying it on until it was perfect. This watch is easy to read. Also, everytime you hit a button on the main clock screen, the nightlight goes on, which wastes battery, which is not a big deal actually since watch batteries last 3 or more years. It has easy to push buttons and the watch is sturdy itself. Lightweight and flexible, this watch will work for almost anybody."
3,Nice design but defective,"I purchased the watch and wore it scuba diving to depths no deeper than 65ft. The watch broke on my 10th dive even though it was designed to dive to over 300ft. Disappointed. I liked the watch though and am getting a replacement, hopefully not defective."
1,WAS an Excellent value and easy to adjust,"I must say that after reading some of the comments I was a little worried about the quality of the watch, however after wearing it now (24/7) for a solid two weeks I am happy with the product and feel that it is certainly worth the money. I am a woman with small wrists and this works just fine (I like chunky watches). The strap is very easy to adjust..in fact just search ""adjust watch strap"" on a YouTube like site and there are plenty of videos out there to help you with step by step instructions...(the watch comes with operational instructions but nothing for adjusting the band). At this price-point, this is a great watch if you're already familiar with IRONMAN products or if you're ready to try IRONMAN out for the first time.****UPDATE Summer 2010****Indeed.... it ended up breaking in a spot where I was unable to fix (a piece of material chipped off right where the pin fits into the watch... Boo. Great looking...bad construction!! I do NOT recommend!"
3,"Watch band too large, cannot adjust enough","I bought this watch and love it EXCEPT that the band is too large even on the smallest setting. Unlike most metal watch bands, this one does not have any way to remove a link. If your wrist is small (and mine is not too small) this watch will be too loose."
2,Boring,"This book was entertaining at first, but was strange that it was written in third person narrative instead of straight from her. After reading over half of the book, I became bored with all the compliments Ashley kept heaping on herself. While she is a beautiful and talented actress, I found her book to be boring in the end."
5,CHERRY BISCUITS ARE THE 'HIP' TREAT FOR DOGS!,"Since my dog is Sr. citizen (72 est. age) I thought I would supplement his diet w/ the Hip Bones Tart Cherry Dog Biscuits. I was thrilled they're a natural product and I use 'cherry juice' remedy for my rare gout problems. I felt it couldn't hurt my dog. He's been almost 'break dancing' to get one of these treats! His vet agreed that they look like a good product. In fact, my dog just had a CBC and the vet remarked: Whatever you're doing, KEEP DOING because his blood work is FANTASTIC for someone his age! I and my dog recommend them 4 paws up!Fran Berdy and her pooch!"
4,"Nice toaster, but don't buy it from Final Auction","I was trying to save a little money, so I bought the refurbished item from Final Auction. ... When I received the item, the toaster has a minor defect. The toast does not come all the way up. Final Auction made the returning process hard and long. Other than don't buy from Final Auction, this is a very cute and stylish toaster for your kitchen."
5,The best toaster and classy as well,"We bought this brand toaster in the two slice chrome finish and WOW what a great machine! It is not a light machine but has some weight to it which we like, as well as a non slide bottomThe three button (bagel, defrost, release) are on the one end of the machine and are easy to use and read as well as classy looking. And the toast turns out absolutely perfect!It is a machine we are proud to have in our kitchen. It is the second machine this company makes (bought their coffee-espresso-cappuccion machine as a gift for my husband) that I have bought and I recommend the maker to anyone who wants a quality product at an excellent price."
1,Not worth the money,I was given this toaster as a gift last Dec. Now 8 months later I am throwing it away. One side does not pop up and burns and the other has to be at the darkest setting and cooked twice to give it any color. When I contacted DeLonghi I was told their warranty was for 1 year but could not help me without a receipt. So buyer beware keep your receipt you are going to need it.
3,great little racer,"This car is a great little racer if you are racing on the proper surfaces All of you who hav been spinning jout it is because u are running on too smoth of surfaces. I have many Hobby class Rc's Nitro and electric they are great but too big to race on a 10"" by 6"" cardboard track! The superslick handles great on cardboard."
1,Not natural!,"The description on this natural-color artificial grass raffia table skirt was incorrect. It was a terrible burnt orange color, and plastic, not raffia. Sort of like shredded garbage bags."
4,this definitely beats the plastic ones,"i first ordered the same thing, but in ""artificial"" material. not a good idea. that plastic stuff looks really fake plasticky. i returned the plastic stuff and got two of these. very pleased. get this product if your looking for grass skirt stuff."
4,A fast funny read,"I was offered this book by my wife on our holidays after I ran out of books to read.To say this is not an epic novel is putting it mildly, but the story line made it impossible to put down and I devoured the book in one day.A humourous look into the life of a nonstop shopping machine, I think we can all releate to the main character whether we are her, or know people like her.The plot reads like waves on the ocean, as we follow the lead characters shopping sprees, and financial troubles rise and falter as she tries to juggle her persoanl life as badly as her check book.A fun fast read that is sure to please"
4,Hilarious,"This was a great book. I just couldn't stop laughing and could really relate to some of the reasons why Becky should have new shoes, outfit, purse etc!! This is a great quick read!!!"
3,Clothes you really can't afford to buy,"This book is light and airy fun--a chick-lit romp through the mind of Rebecca Bloomwood, a girl who is only happy when she's spending money she doesn't really have. There was something a little seductive about the story. It made me want to run to the nearest boutique and start spending with reckless abandon. Luckily, the details about Rebecca's debt and financial troubles were an antidote. Sometimes, Rebecca's serial ditsiness was a little annoying, but by the end of the book she seemed to be headed on the right track. I say ""headed"" because the ending was unsatisfyingly vague--no doubt to leave room for the multiple sequels that the author has already published. I saw the movie version of this before I read this book, and as is usually the case, the book is much better than the very silly movie, but I doubt I'll be reading any of the sequels. A little of Rebecca goes a long way--and anyway, I'd hate to catch the shopaholic disease from her."
2,Confessions of boredom,"I read this book because even though the movie got bad reviews I figured if they made a movie from a book at least the book was good.I was wrong!Boring, stupid, unrealistic ending."
3,Gets better by the second half,"This book started off a little boring. Plus, I felt badly forher and her uncontrollable urge to spend money and to avoid thecreditors. Luckily I kept reading the book to the end becauseit gets better and more interesting by the second half of thebook. This is a light & entertaining book."
4,I confess I really liked this book.,"To anyone who has seen the movie, but is thinking of reading the book: whaT are you waiting for? I thought this book was great. It was funny although a little predictable however that may be because I have seen the movie. I found myself trully connecting with Becky. I think we all have a little bit of her in us all.."
2,Falls way short of expectations,"I completely agree with the few others who said the book doesn't begin to get interesting until the final chapters, then ends too abruptly. I've also read Bridget Jones Diary and this book is not in the same league, as far as writing caliber and humor are concerned. The majority of the book is focused on the main character trying to control her wild spending habits, with little else to stimulate readers. After the rationalization of approximately her 50th purchase, this tends to get a little tedious. This book might be entertaining for those who want a light summer read and excessive detail on the main character's shopping purchases, but there is no extensive character development and no wickedly funny humor, as found in BJD. I'm surprised to find this book comes so highly recommended."
2,"Should be called ""Confessions of a Pathological Liar!""","This book was terrible. I always finish the books I read, it was done painstakingly with this book. Her lying was just annoying!! I don't even understand how she ended up with the guy in the end. Truelly terrible book"
2,Bridget Jones Diary Rip-off,"This book follows the same formula as Bridget Jones Diary. However, the ""Shopaholic"" is nowhere near as endearing as Bridget Jones is. Rebecca, the ""Shopaholic"" is materialistic, shallow, irresponsible, and a liar. ""Jerk"" is probably the best word I can come up with right now to describe her. I gave it two stars because it's a fast-paced book but I cannot find anything else good to say about it. I bought the second installment--""Shopaholic Takes Manhattan"" book which I will read--but only because I've already wasted my money on it."
5,Laugh-out-loud funny!,"I happened to pick this up at the library, since the title sounded interesting. What a hoot! Apparently this is a genre called ""chick-lit"" and I'm far from the target audience (as a 70-year-old gay man). The characters are more caricatures than realistic (I hope!) but the book is full of laugh-out-loud funny passages. Pick it up if you're looking for a mindless couple of hours of entertainment. Very funny!"
2,I cannot say why I picked this up other than it was in audio-book form for free.,"I am happy for Rebecca at the moment, but her story, perhaps necessarily, has not drawn to a satisfactory close. I am not in the 'demographic' for this novel, I simply liked that the name of the author was called Sophie. The audio book reader was FANTASTIC, I say brightly.Still, I cannot see pleasure in the confessions of someone so outrightly deceiving themselves and others. If it were not for the audio book performance, and even with that, I almost abandoned it. Fair to say it caught me up at the end of the day.Having endured the agony through and through, I'd place this just above a worthless read. Maybe those who can identify with Rebecca will wake up a bit (and smell the Morning Coffee). Still... we are not sure that she has.In short: Agonizing and dissatisfying."
5,A Definite Must for Chick Lit Fans Everywhere!!!,"Oh what a tangled web we weave when once we practice to spend, spend, spend! Yes, Becky has a shopping addiction and yes, she is a bit naive at times, but she is so sweet and always has the best intentions. You can't help but love her. And you'll love all the other characters in the story as well, especially dreamy Luke. I read this book in two days, and I will definitely be reading it again. I've already read the next installment and can't wait to read the third and fourth!"
4,Funny but Stupid,"Reading this McFiction is ecapism at it's PUREST! - She's living in MAJOR debt and the rich smart dude totally falls for her and she gets a TV job. Nevermind that she makes a complete idiot of herself about a jazillion times throughout the book, she should've shredded her credit cards a lot sooner. I'm starting to think that Kinsella has a talent for writing narratives about really dumb heroines who don't know when to stop being clueless. It would almost be funnier if she wrote about a SMART heroine with bad luck who manages to overcome a bunch of BS that is thrown at her. . . . hmmmm. I still want to read her sequels though . . . the plot twists are really good. Let the hilarity ensue."
3,I am not into shopping so it was ok,I love the author and bought this book thinking i would be getting the same 'i cant put this down' type story. I didnt get into the obsession with shopping and did not think it was as funny. More or less the character was just too shallow for me.
1,Why would anyone think this was good?,"I don't understand all the people who rave about this book. It is absolutely one of the worst books ever written. I would have given it no stars at all if I could.The main character is a completely self-absorbed, shallow, individual who is obsessed with how she looks and the brand names of her clothing. She epitomizes everything wrong with capitalism today.The passages where she has to buy that new thing, whatever it is, and doesn't have her card with her and so has to rearrange her entire day and put her job in jeopardy just to get it, is disturbing, not funny.The whole time I was reading this book I kept saying to myself, ""Now, I know that was supposed to be funny, but instead, I find it to be disgusting, disturbing and I think the main character needs a shrink not another pair of Prada shoes!"".If you are looking for a ""fun"" read, as most seem to think this book is, I recommend you look elsewhere."
2,The Book Title Says it all...,"Although the book has some amusing parts, the biggest part of it is Rebecca ""Becky"" Bloomwood shopping and getting into tremendous debt. She works for a magazine writing on finance but spends more of her time (and thoughts) on shopping or where people got their things.The story is not particularly ""romantic"" or even that funny. If you know a lot about haute couture name brands (British in this book, American in the sequel), you can follow her thoughts and shopping fairly well but quickly tire of her excuses and ignoring of her debt (to the point of making up a stalker to avoid her bank manager).But of course, being chick lit, it all works out in the end and she's off for another adventure (pretty much more of the same) in Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.Get it if you really need something to read but if you want good chick lit, check out the Plum series for American or Bridget Jones's Diary for British."
5,Just so funny and make me feel...shopping is not a sin!!!,"I just couldn't stop reading this book. This book has a really nice tempo and you can't just stop reading. It reminded me of my age of 20s. I was just like her when it comes to shopping. I shared a lot of things with Becky, yes, shopping on bargen actually is a saving!!"
2,A sub-standard knockoff of Bridget Jones's Diary,"While I enjoyed certain aspects of this book, the thought that constantly hovered over me was, ""this book is almost exactly the same as Bridget Jones's Diary!"" Let's see, young single woman works a crappy job, has difficulty controlling various aspects of her life, is constantly lying and then getting caught in lies, hits rock bottom and then all of a sudden, quite miraculously by chance her whole life is turned around by a well-timed (and lucky) decision and simultaneously lands gorgeous millionaire....sound a bit like Bridget Jones? Yeah, I thought so too. The only difference is that BJD is so much funnier and more believable and more LIKEABLE. I can't see why this book was ever published. If you're in the market for a funny read go with Bridget Jones's Diary and the sequel, The Edge of Reason by Helen Fielding. Much, MUCH better."
3,Lots of silly fun!,"It's funny how I keep gravitating towards these Shopaholic books when I always feel so exasperated by Rebecca's irresponsibility. She lives in a perpetual state of denial and has lost touch with reality, yet things always seem to work out for her in the end. Not very believable! However, the books are brilliantly written and flow so nicely. The characterizations are very impeccibly drawn and the dialogue is hilarious! As much as I wanted to be impatient towards Rebecca, I couldn't help cheering for her and admiring her for being so creative."
3,What a bore...,"Ok, you can't help but like Rebecca Bloomwood's character, but did anyone start to get a little annoyed at her shallowness? Well, I did. As she shops, and shops, and shops some more...she she stresses out and gets nasty letters from the bank. Big deal...but this was going on for most of the book. Finally things start to happen and the story gets pretty good.'Confessions of a Shopaholic' is a 'cutsie' little book that I couldn't wait to finish."
5,I am a shopaholic!!,"From the moment I picked this book up I could not put it down! It was me! I was reading about me! Of course when I got deeper in I knew Becky had it WAY worse than I do! But I reason every ""bargain"" and shop as a pick-me up. I just felt myself relating to every word and just couldn't wait to find out what happened. And I couldn't wait to read the next book to follow Beckys trials once again. Fabulous book. Could never say enough! If you've ever gotten knots in your stomach over receiving your credit card bills you've gotta read this. haha!"
4,relaxing & humorous,"while reading this book i saw myself in becky's character.i can pretty much relate to her indiscrimate spending habits and her excuses to buy useless things. i just wish the author could have focused some more to becky & suze friendship.this book has such universal appeal that most women from any part of the world and across all age groups can relate to. it tackled a very common yet serious problem,i.e. poor handling of finances, in a very light and humorous way. it is so engrossing that i cannot put the book down. i cant wait to read the sequel!"
4,Quick Read - but so true,"I enjoyed this book. It was a light quick read for a lazy afternoon. I must admit, I saw a lot of myself in the book. Perhaps I'm a shopaholic and never realized it. Unfortunately, I couldn't give it five stars because I could put it down. It just didn't have the hook I had hoped for, it seemed to lack something. The characters were amusing and fun, but I couldn't seem to root for them very easily. The main character is fun and smart, but she seemed to lack the realness I had thought she would have. On the whole though, it was light and fun, nothing too serious."
2,"Cute, predictable, and childish","This book lives up to Kinsella's writing style - cute, light hearted, and chicky. But, I found this book too childish for my tastes. It did not keep my attention and was very predictable."
4,I was expecting it would be funnier.,"I'm sure everyone knows someone like this person. It was an easy read, but I did expect it to be a much funnier read. Still prefer: Can you keep a secret? or Bridget Jones' Diary series. If you want a light, easy read and some humor at times this is a good book for you."
2,I am a shopaholic but...,"I'm a shopaholic and I really liked Bridget Jones' Diary, but this book was a bad clone of the aforementioned book. The main character was not very interesting and the writing itself was not very good (it was several steps below that of Bridget Jones' Diary). The best thing I can say is that it's a fast read and, if you're an anglophile, you might be somewhat amused by it."
1,"When I finished, I threw it away","I didn't want to keep this book around.I have read both of the Bridget Jones books, and this one appears to be somewhat of a ripoff (not knockoff) of Bridget. The main character, Rebecca, is a liar and a compulsive shopper who feigns a relative's death to cover another lie. How repulsive. The lies this woman tells are so selfish, childish, and awkward that I was embarrassed for both the character and the author. I didn't find much humor in it at all and I loved both Bridgets.(I'm not concerned with those who don't find my review ""helpful."" It is truthful as I see it, and I am not seeking their approval anyway. I considered this book a waste of time and money. You may disagree with my opinion, but I obviously disagree with yours as well.)"
3,Confessions Of A Shopaholic,"This book, was pretty good but not my favorite. It your a girl who loves to shop, i think you would enjoy readng this book. Becky deals with alot of problems, because she uses her credit card way to much, and since she is a journalist, she doesn't make enough money to pay them off. This book doesn't start to get interesting untill the middle. At the end of the book, everything gets better, Becky finally meets this man, and pays off her hcredit cards."
5,Shopaholic,"I have not enjoyed a book this much in quite some time. While it is an extrememly light read, I thought it was well written & quite humorous. The main character was very likeable & you felt your heart pound each time she made a purchase & was been sought after by her creditor. It's a book you can digest extremely fast & leaves you wanting more!"
3,We've All Been There,"Well many of us have, and that is what makes this a fun and quick read. I know I used to have mail that went unopened because I didn't want to face the bitter truth inside! This is what the main character, Rebecca, goes through on a daily basis. Yeah, she is in major denial, but that's what your 20s are for - learning. Although I enjoyed the book, I only give it 3 stars because I was a bit let down by the ending. However, if you want a pleasant and funny beach-read, this is the perfect choice. However, after reading some of it, you may be possessed to hit the mall, instead!"
4,must read for those who have ever maxed a credit card,"Rebecca shops for an easy high, only to find it's a cheap thrill at best. I laughed at her compulsiveness, and especially at her schemes to overcome her debt. Though the solution to her maxxed credit cards was a bit over-simplified, Rebecca Bloomwood could still sit at the table with Bridget Jones for adorable neurosis."
4,Been there Done This,"Well, not really quite as bad as the main character Rebecca Bloomfield, but I have certainly understood the mounting pressue of bills. I am not quite the shopper she is either!A delightful book in which Ms. Kinsella develops a wonderful first person voice and character. It is perhaps the center point of the entire book. You keep reading to she what Bex (as she is called by her flatmate) will think next. For the majority of the book her mind is alomst always in the wrong place at the wrong time. In fact, the joy of her character is the insistence on remaining herself.The character development is the overwhelming joy of this book. The plot get reptitive around 3/4 of the way through the book until the climax comes around, but this is hardly a downfall of the book. There are also some interesting literary references (intended or unintended) to other author's first books, e.g. The Sun Also Rises."
5,Bravo!!,"One of the cutest, funniest and most addicting novels that I've ever read. I always finish the Shopaholic series in one sitting. They may very well be my most favorite books. Keep 'em coming Ms. Kinsella!"
2,Novel's target audience for the young,"A friend suggested I read this ""light"" novel for fun and I found this book incredibly boring. The heroine, Rebecca Bloomwood, has a fluffy personality and doesn't even have her head on straight when it comes to her work as a financial writer. Her thought process in making valid reasons why she is a compulsive shopper were humourous in the beginning but half way through the book, I was getting tired of having the same old point drilled to me that Rebecca buys things to compensate for self worth.""Confessions"" is unrealistic and the other characters in the book are not developed enough to make it worthwhile to remember their names. This book is understandably meant to be just a quick read."
2,Why is this book not funny?,"I just don't get it. Why should we like Rebecca? She is not only an uncontrollable shopaholic, but she is an uncontrollable liar. She is continually lying to her boyfriend, her roommate, her parents, her employers... it's not funny, it's pathetic. I don't think that this concept - a young woman who can't pay her bills because she is obsessed with clothing and shopping - so much that she lies to everyone - is enough to fuel one book, let alone two. What am I missing here?"
5,Charge it and then read it!,"This is the first in the ""shopaholic"" series that I have read and I'm hooked. It was such a crazy and fun tale about Rebecca buying and shopping like noone's business that I could not put the book down. I want to read the whole line of shopaholic books now!If you are a seriel shopper or try to be one, read this book. It will make you laugh and has many true to life moments. You will love it!"
5,Introducing Rebecca Bloomwood,"The first installment of the Rebecca Bloomwood story is a fantastic light read for just about anyone, unless you're expecting a highly regarded literary piece. This simple story is full of comical mishaps and relationship blunders that many of us can relate too.Sure, I could point out that some of the characters are underdeveloped and some of the plot lines could have been drawn out, but this isn't the kind of book that deserves that kind of nitpicking. It's a simple book that doesn't require much thinking and memorizing and flipping back to the first chapter just to keep up with the story.At any rate, this is a good, quick read. If you're looking for a serious read, I don't suggest this. But if you're a shopaholic who daydreams about winning the lottery and meeting the man of your dreams, this book will suit you just fine."
1,Dreadfully boring,"I found this book terribly dull and repetitive. After 100 pages of the ""heroine"" trying to convince herself that every 50 pounds (about $100) spent on an unnecessary item is money well spent, I couldn't stomach any more. I didn't find her rationalizations and lying amusing, just annoying. She is materialistic and quite an airhead, and I couldn't give a darn about her. I was looking forward to a light summer read, but in this one, nothing much ever seems to happen, besides her spending money, detailing what she's spent it on, and vacillating between chastising herself for it or rationalizing it. The other people she interacts with seem to matter little to her, and it makes it hard for the reader to care, either. I am surprised so many people enjoyed this book so much!"
5,Awesome!,"Honestly one of 3 books I have read in my entire life, and it totally turned me on to reading...and reading more of her amazing books. What an absolute amazing author!!! She really draws you in to Becky's world and makes you feel like you watch the story unfold....!!!! GREAT!"
4,"Slow starter, but gets good.","It actually took me a while to finish this book because I was bored with it in the begining. I felt that the main character was irritating, stupid and boring. Finally when i got to the middle of the book it started getting a lot more interesting and I started actually feeling sorry for her. It has a great ending and i actually bought the next book in the series."
5,Hilarious!!!!!,"I bought this book several months ago and just put it on the bookcase when I got home. This weekend I was desperate for a book to read and pulled ""Confessions"" out. It was hilarious and laugh out loud!! If you have ever had shopping or credit problems, you will relate to the antics of this character. It was very easy to read (I read it in 24 hours)and fun. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a fun, easy read to have by poolside this summer. LOVED IT!!"
4,Laugh Out Loud,"Okay, I know this is complete fluff. But Kinsella can turn a phrase and make me laugh out loud. The read is fast and funny, and the heroine is sympathetic despite her shopping compulsion. Her roundabout justifications of purchases are amusing -- because I do know people who think exactly like this. It's the hysterical lines that keep me going back to Kinsella."
3,Lighthearted and Funny!,I really enjoyed this book and I finished it on a long plane ride. I recommend it to anyone who loves to shop and loves a little romance! You don't have to be single to enjoy this!!
5,Laugh Out Loud!,"I was sooo addicted to the book just pages after I started. Although I cannot ever think of spending that much money, I know how it is to procrastinate a little. A great summer read!"
4,lovely fun read,a very fun read which helps you to see why it was turned into a movie. it gives you an uplifted feeling by the end. I'd like to read more in the shopaholic vein.
1,Hated it!!!!!!,If you like shallow people and compulsive lying...this book is for you. The story was a little too far fetched for me.
2,Just an okay book,"This book is only good as a quick read and nothing else. As the book goes, Becky becomes tiresome with her ever consuming demands for brand name goods.What saves the book is a couple plot twists which were nicely done by Kinsella."
4,Simply Splendid,Great book! Definitely hard to put down...I finished it in a few days. Fun story line! I am excited to purchase its sequel tomorrow!
5,funny,"Sophie Kinsella has it down to a science. I'm a shopoholic myself and I found myself agreeing with Becky's reasons for buying all the things she does. It tells a great story of a young twenty-something living in a big city and wanting it all. I flew through this book - it was easy to read, lighthearted and entertaining. If you love to shop , you'll get a kick out of this book! Another book that I enjoyed was ""Good Grief"", and ""He Never Called Again."""
4,Fairy Tale Solution,"I read this book right after finishing Bridget Jones's Diary and I must say, these English girls do go in for the perfect fairy tale ending! I give this book 4 stars for its high fun quotient and its realistic portrayal of addiction--the lying, justification, denial, cut-and-run tactics, the whole bit. I know!In spite of not particularly liking the main character (I can't stand women whose only priority is how fabulous they look; too shallow for me), I found myself rooting for her when she stood up for herself or finally got honest about something. Granted, it didn't happen very often. Perhaps it's a credit to the author to create a character I could emotionally buy into; maybe I'm a sucker. Either way, I wanted this crazy girl to snap out of it and get herself together.While the laughs in this book aren't as many as in ""Bridget,"" it's still pretty funny, and several episodes are complete gut-busters. Buy this book for yourself and all the compulsive shoppers in your life!"
3,Not for Kids' Eyes,"I bought this so I could exercise with my kids dancing alongside me. A few of the moves were a little too ""adult"" for me to feel comfortable with my children joining me. I expected the clothing to be a little sparse on the dance instructors, but I also expected family-friendly moves. I still like the video, but I don't use it nearly as often as I had hoped since I have to wait until my children aren't home."
5,Good,"If you like the manga and don't mind the changes done in the movie, then I would recommend this movie."
4,"Delivers as advertised, pretty good book","I bought this book along with the companion book on Landscapes. A lot of the same material is covered, and in both cases I think does a pretty good job. The material is dealt with systematically, discussing both machinics, technique and composition.Like other books that survey a broad subject, I think it tends to miss some specifics that would be necessary to really learn at a detail level. For example, the discussion of flash photography discusses built-in flashes, dedicated flashes, and studio lighting all in one short chapter, but in not enough detail to help you make much progress with any.I did like the sections by other National Geo photographers who wrote a couple pages describing their thoughts and delivering advice.So this is a pretty good book and is one of those things you should read even if you know most of what it has to say."
2,Great at first...,I bought this machine one year ago. I am now online looking for a replacement. I love the pod adapter (I don't mind paying extra for pods because they are so convenient). I think the frother is amazing. Overall the machine worked great for the first 10 months. Now it leaks all over the place. I have to put a bowl under the dispenser while it heats up to keep water from dripping all over my kitchen counter. I am really disappointed because I loved the machine so much.
5,Very good fryer!,It is a wonderful fryer! Very simple to use and uses less oil than other fryers. Easy to clean too! I recommend it!
5,You can't beat this fryer,"We have only used this a few times, but I already know this is the best fryer we have EVER owned in 20+ years. The price was perfect, shipping as always was fast. It's true you get way less oil if any in the food since the basket spins. We set our home (shoestring) fries on 10 min, and they came out perfect. Cleanup? I have never seen someone come up with the perfect drainSomeone must have been up late @ night figuring this out. Very simplistic. Raise the basket handle, raise the empty spout latch cover, pull the rubber hose down, set the fryer on the sink with the oil catcher in the sink, pinch the hose, pop the plug, and let her drain. Took maybe 60 sec.We didn't use the screen since we don't use oil over and over. This really is a dream machine. Even has the safety plug for people with kids. If they pull or hit the electric cord, it disconnects insted of pulling a hot pot of oil on them. I couldn't be happier."
2,"Well, I'm back to stove-top frying","What I think this machine does fairly well is _small_ batches of french fries.It does not handle battered foods well, nor I have found it an acceptable replacement for stove-top deep frying of spring rolls and won ton.The thermostat is certainly handy, but I share another reviewer's annoyance at how easily the basket falls off the mechanism (it's not like there's a huge margin for error in deep-frying, and doing the ""Oh-my-goodness-how'm-I-gonna-get-that-thing-out"" dance while the food is getting darker and darker does not make me especially happy).I also do not find the oil drain easy to operate.So I'm back to stove top methods for most deep frying. Take a heavy pan with tall, but not too tall sides..."
1,Failed after a year,"I bought this thing wanting to use less oil to fry. It worked for about a year and then the basket failed to rotate. Since it was now out of warranty I had to take it apart to see if I could fix it. I replaced the o-ring thinking that would do something, but still it failed to rotate. I tried to sand down the shaft, but still it failed. I finally threw it away and went back to using my frying pan. It's a good idea, but just failed. I do not recommend this product."
5,Best deep fryer ever,"This is the best deep fryer on the market - no exception. The rotating basket keeps foods from absorbing excess grease and the temperature control is top notch. The design for the grease drain and basket is perfect for filtering used grease and storing it. If you ever decide to purchase a deep fryer, don't waste time or money on any other product."
3,"Good, but ...","A great little fryer. However, for small amounts. Even a large onion is not totally emersed in the oil (not a good thing when cooking a blooming onion). And cooking time is longer due to the tilt design of the interior. I like it for small entrees (eg, beaded fish for 1 or 2 people, fried potatoes, etc). But, I would not buy again, due to the limited capacity. Easy clean-up!"
3,Some cool features,"We upgraded to this fryer from the Waring Pro WPF100B we bought from Costco. What I really like about this fryer is the oil storage container, drain valve and the filters to reduce the frying odor. The downside is that it doesn't fry as well as my other fryer. The food takes a little longer and it seems like the food retains more grease. However, the odor and drain are more important to me at this point, so we'll stick with it. The one really bad thing is that the lid to my oil storage container cracked already and we've only had it for 2 weeks! I'm not sure how to get another lid yet.9/15/10 UpdateWe're reverted back to the WaringPro. It was taking way too long to cook food which caused food to be much greasier. I have a feeling that the temperature gauge as far as heating up time isn't accurate either."
5,Last I checked.........,"Last I checked, if it looked like a box it was a box, but these are the round ones. I checked and cross checked with the Westin website prior to ordering.Simple 5 minute bolt on to the Westin Bull Bar, and a simple 10 minute wire job to the parking lights......they sure are purtty!.....And man are they bright!Oh, did I mention they sure are purtty?"
2,Too much sugar?,"Let's clear up a misconception. Starch foods cannot be used by the body until the starch is digested into glucose! This is exactly the same glucose that already exists in fruit! The author perpetuates a misconception by stating that raw food diets that replace cooked starches with raw fruit are too high in sugar and fat. A proper amount of bioavailable carbohydrates is needed, regardless of the source. In addition, cooked starches contain harmful AGEs, advanced glycation end products, and they are much higher in acidogenic minerals (phosphorus) per calorie than most fresh raw fruit. This helps explain why research has linked starch intake to cancer, autoimmune diseases, and digestive sensitivities. Vitamin C and B vitamins are also destoyed by cooking, but remain intact in raw fruit, along with valuable enzymes. This book is a good starter for people moving to a plant-based diet, but please don't believe misconceptions about fruit that the author spreads to sell his book."

3,Classic Rock for your Toddler!,"This is one of a series of ""Babies Go ..."" CDs which I found last year at Toy Fair. Each of the titles is devoted to ""Classic Rock"" group and is aimed at parents who grew up on these songs. They are manufactured in Argentina - and feature a band named Sweet Little Band. There are no liner notes to speak of so I can place the instruments but much of it seems to be played on synthesizers. There is a prominent tinkling sound of a toy piano as well. But these aren't new versions of the standard nursery rhymes; they are all the big hits from each group.The Pink Floyd CD has the requisite ""Another Brick In The Wall"" along with 13 other PF classicsWhether you child will understand what they are listening to is one thing, but parents will enjoy the break from hearing the ""same old - same old"".A clever idea - I even took these on a trip to lull me to sleep!Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
3,it takes two,"The book is ok. I have the movie so it wasn't a real blessin'. If you want to buy it, i wouldn't recommend it, but if you really want to, well, lets just say i guess... GO FOR IT!"
5,Original Licks!,"When I first played this CD I could not decide if Vardis are Punk Rock or NWOBHM I have to say that this music is hard to define. Chuck Berry meets Led Zep is the best I can do. This band are genuine and deliver very raw, very British sounding heavy metal rock and roll at its best. Steve Zodiac's very original sounding guitar licks project him to guitar hero status. Very British. What a band."
5,Fits well but sits low,"Sits lower than a factory hitch, (about 12"" off the ground.), but overall works great."
4,Looks like a good deal,"The real test will be using it for years without it failing, but I can rate delivery, installation and components. Delivery was trouble free. Installation went smoothly. Directions were clear; the fit to the Toyota preexisting taps was exact, and I was able to install it by myself. The components appear rugged; there is no evidence of cheaping out. At this point, it looks like a good deal. If I had a second truck, I'd buy another one."
5,DeLonghi AS670 Airstream,"This is an A+ product! I purchased this toaster oven for my husbands first father's day, and was it ever a good choice. We were looking to replace out Krups ProChef Plus which we had for about 2 years (the Krups Toaster did not hold up well to daily use - hard to keep clean, dials stopped working). The DeLonghi not only has wonderful features, such as defrost and dehydration settings, but it is very easy to keep clean. Crumbs don't hide themselves around the dials, the surface is easily cleaned, even with cooked on food. We are very happy with this product and will continue to purchase DeLonghi products."
1,Money doesn't buy quality,"Perhaps I'm expecting too much, but if I spend this much on a countertop appliance, I expect it to last. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the toasting function *does* tend to dry out the toast. My solution is to preheat the oven until both elements are glowing and *then* put in the bread. I watch until it is done & then immediately remove it. It works, but it's a hassle.What disappoints me the most is that over the last few months I've begun to have problems closing the door. When it started it was only after the oven was quite hot (broiling, etc.). I assumed something in the guide mechanism was warping due to the heat and it always worked again once the oven cooled down. It gradually began occuring sooner and sooner and now the door will not close at all.I probably only use the oven 2-3 times a month. In my experience, this is not an appliance that can tolerate regular use. I'm very disappointed."
2,"""IT'S AN OVEN NOT A TOASTER""",THIS OVEN IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. WE USE OURS MOSTLY TO TOAST OUR MORNING TOAST AND TO WARM BREAD. UNFORTUNATELY THE TOASTER OVEN DRYS OUT THE BREAD AND DOES NOT GIVE IT ANY COLOR UNLESS THE TEMP. IS SET ALL THE WAY TO THE MAXIMIUM HEAT LEVEL.. WE'VE HAD TO TAKE OUR OLD $39.00 TOASTER OVEN OUT OF STORAGE TO GET DECIENT TOAST.L.PICCIN
3,Good account....,"I liked it but did expect more. While Archer remains one of my all time favorite authors, and I do feel bad for him. I need to now go and read the details of why he was really sent to prison. Living in the u.s., the details were few and far between. He had it bad, but was it horrible? could have been better, but certainly could have been worse...."
4,A great read,"This is a very good insight to the British prisons, as told through Mr Archer. (or Lord Archer...).It shows the prison system - grizzly, dark, violent... And shows how some people should not be in Cat A prisons, or not go at all.. Some come out even worse than before they go in.An easy read. Makes you feel sorry for Mr Archer."
2,maybe it's just me...,"this shirt looked awful on me. it is not flattering at all. I couldn't tell if it was just because I didn't look good being pregnant, or if it was that the shirt was terrible. I think it was more the shirt. also I found it to be very stiff."
4,Great value but uncommon drive style,"I'm really happy with this addition to my tool arsenal. Nearly as powerful as my I-R air impact wrench and more portable. I bought an adapter to convert from the somewhat unusual 7/16"" heavy duty hex drive to a standard 1/2"" impact socket wrench style drive. The included car charger makes this a great go-anywhere kit if you think you might be doing tire changes under difficult circumstances, again as long as you have the correct adapter to use it with your impact sockets. If it came with an adapter I would give the tool five stars right off the bat."
4,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed reading this book, and while I may not agree (believe) it all there is a lot of very interesting points. I have adopted some of the changes and I have seen a difference."
5,Demonic Toys 3-Pack,"The movie was awesome, everything was perfect, perfect condition, very fast shipping. Anyone who buys from them will see exactly what I mean :)"
4,A must have!,"Never having been to Europe I was unsure what to expect. I knew all about the famous landmarks, but what about places to stay and eat? This book does an excellent job of dividing London up into little pieces with reviews and pricing information for areas in and around London. It is making our itinerary much easier to plan."
2,"Worked great, but.......","I've owned one of these for a while now and in general, I'm impressed. Foods cook more quickly with the convection fan turned on.Cooking toast is pretty disappointing. You can cook up to 6 slices, but it takes FOREVER and the bread is badly dried out. I suppose if you're a glass-is-half-full type, it's REALLY good at producing large croutons.My biggest complaint is the design of the bottom mode switch. The shaft is made out of plastic (the other two have steel shafts) and the silly thing just broke off and you can't find spare parts. My unit is out of warranty and at this point, I'm going to toss my oven in the trash and find something better made with better support.I'm also going to buy a real toaster and stop wasting energy and time producing sub-quality toast."
5,new edtion heartbreak,great cd they just missed numbered the cd total is really 15 but still an great cd this is there best cd yet im glad i replaced my cd i wish b brown was on this album
5,My Boys,"When this album came out I remember me and my friends would learn the dance steps to all of the songs we could on this album. It was definately their best album. Home again would have been if they put a little more work into it because it was all 6 of them. But my favorite cuts that stand out is""Can You Stand The Rain""(The extended remix was the sh*#),If It Isn't Love, Boys To Men, the Cucial remix version, and ""Superlady"". New Edition is my favorite group of all time because I basically grew up with them and had many experiences with their records playing, I just really hope they will all squash the beefs they have with one another a put out another album like this one, even with Bobby Brown. -Gwhiz"
4,Exceptional - Moving - Humbling,"Aside from Nanci's sometimes laborious introductions, the music on this CD is timeless and makes me feel like I'm sitting on a porch swing up in the Smokey Mountains. It's touching, sweet music that warms the soul."
5,love this woman's music,have all most all Ms.Griffith's albums and absolutely love them all.Even her most country to her few rock tunes.
5,A BIG FAN,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF NANCI GRIFFITH SINCE SHE DID "" FROM A DISTANCE"" I LOVE HER PLAYING AND HER ABILITY TO WRITE SONGS. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HER MAKE MORE DVD'S. I HAVE PURCHASED MOST OF HER CD'S AND HER ONE DVD. PLAN TO SEE HER WHEN SHE COMES TO HUNTSVILLE, AL. THANKS, JENNIE SCOTT"
5,Cat Crazies toy,"My cats LOVE these. They bat them around, pick the up in their mouths and throw them. They even bring them to my bedroom and leave them for me as ""gifts."""
2,Not For My Cats,Bought these because of all the glowing reviews. My two could care less. I do see them in different places sometimes in the mornings but it's usually only about 1 roll from where I left them. At least I don't have to hunt them down or order more because they lost them. Ordered different kinds of these but they dissed all of them. Cats.......
4,great seller - fast shipping,We have had these for just over a month and have just started the 2nd log. SO far we have one shitake growing on the first log. The logs are much smaller than I expected.
5,Great Country Swing!,"When I first heard ""Tulsa"" on the radio, I didn't know who was singing and I had never heard of Wayne Hancock, but I thought at the time, ""This guy, whoever he is, is channeling Hank Williams!"" Luckily, I found out who sang that song and immediately went out and bought this album. If you like country swing, you will love this CD!"
5,Awesome Anointing!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The entire cd is worth a rating higher than 5 stars. This cd really ministered to me. I had written an email to Mr. McClurkin and that is something that I have not done to any artist. That is how much this cd ministered to my spirit. I do have a favorite and that is ""Just for me"". To God be the glory for the album. All the blessings to Donnie for allowing God to us him in a mighty way such as this. Ministering to millions of people in such as way as this is an action that pleases God. My last words about this cd is awesome anointing, awesome anointing, awesome anointing!!!!!!!!!"
4,Wonderful,"A very beautiful and uplifting cd. Donnie McClurkin's music simply warms the soul. My favorites are ""That's what I Believe"", ""Psalm 27"" and ofcourse the inspirational ""We fall down""."
5,my vegan bible,"I happen to love this cookbook. It is the staple I always turn to, after buying several other vegan cookbooks before and being thoroughly disappointed. I make the gooey grilled cheeze at least once a week (works up really quick if I get home late from work!), and have loved everything I've tried. If maple syrup were cheaper, I'd have a constant supply of the maple custard around! This book is full of everyday recipes that are suitable for anyone. Depending on meal presentation and what sides you serve, it can be a small family meal or dinner party worthy. The recipes are not horribly complicated or full of crazy ingredients or flavors (my main issues with How it all vegan and Voluptous Vegan, which collect dust on my shelf now). Thanks to Vegan Vittles, I became a huge fan of Jo Stepaniak's recipes and have gone on to buy Ultimate Uncheese, Saucy Vegetarian and others. VV is full of a great variety of recipes that are certified fabulous!"
3,health food that tastes like health food,"These are convenient recipes for a healthy vegan household. However, I would not use ANY of these recipes to showcase the vegan diet to non-vegetarians. These recipes in comparison to the usual American diet are BLAND CITY. One meal of this book would have a carnivore running to the comfort of a Big Mac. A much tastier cookbook is ""How it All Vegan"". These recipes are DELICIOUS, convenient, AND IMPRESSIVE."
2,Ick.,"The recipes in this book are all mock meat and dairy dishes. If you like real vegan food, I recommend staying a hundred feet away from this book at all times. Try ""The Voluptuous Vegan"", ""The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen"", or ""The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen"" instead. If you want a book by Stepaniak, buy ""The Vegan Sourcebook"" instead -- the recipes in that book aren't as bad (they aren't that great either), but it's very well written and contains tons of relevant information for vegans (i.e. why circuses are not vegan). The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the ""veganisms"" that she has in this book. What to say instead of ""how to kill two birds with one stone"" and stuff like that and because of the animal stories from farm sanctuary. I don't think those two things are worth the purchase. Stay away."
3,where are the vittles?,"I've tried several recipes from this book, and they are awfully bland. I was looking for something with a little more zest, and was sadly disappointed. The Black Bean Soup recipe was the worst. I tried the recipes off the side of my Black Bean Goya can, and it was delicious. (hint, hint) The ""veganist"" diatribe inside this book was just as annoying. Just give me the recipes, and shut your trap."
5,Wonderful vegan cookbook,"This cookbook is great because not only does it have tasty recipes, it also contains very good information about veganism. There are photos of some of the animals at Farm Sanctuary as well. One of my all-time favorite recipes in this book is ""Southern Fried Tofu."" Talk about tasty! This dish is out-of-this-world! Tastes great with some vegan mashed potatoes."
5,Great camera... Tons of Pluses--One small Minus,"I am very happy with this camera, which I received as a gift. I have own two digital cameras in the past and this is the best by far.The only minus is that the zoom is difficult to use and you must hold the camera very steady.Pluses...Battery seems to last longer than mostPicture quality is fantastic. I have blown many up and they look greatYou get nice short video with audioLove the sepia and black and white choiceWorks well indoors and outdoorsVery easy to useEasy to download picturesWho ever designed this camera did an excellent job. It is so easy to use and the pictures are of excellent quality."
1,worst camera out there,bought this a little over a year ago JUNK> won;t buy kodak againIt stopped in the middle of a picture and will not power up.. looking everywhere online for information lots of problems out there with this camera but no help..300.00 when i bought it now 120. still not worth it....
5,Poptastic!!,Okay who can deny it? The 1980's had one of the best pop songs in exsistance! This album is a MUST HAVE for any pop lover!
1,crud,"I know this is going to sound like blasphamy, but this book is complete and total garbage; Judith Weston may be a wonderful human being with a lot of friends in the industry but her book is like a hack magazine article padded out to book length."
2,better shop around,"i was really disappointed when i received this book. the book is poorly organized and confusing. the directing/acting techniques are basic. and the whole thing is written with this weird dianetics style.luckily i discovered ""the actor prepares"" by stanislovsky. its THE acting book. and written from the point of view from a director trying to improve the performance of his actors."
5,It works,"I needed to work with actors for a project and I was really nervous on what to do. I had no idea how to work with actors. This book gives you a real method to work with professional actors. It also told you how actors think and work, so you can understand their craft better. Sometimes the book went off into some side story, but you can skip those over and get to the real meaty stuff."
4,A nice CCM Christmas collection,"This is a nice collection of Christmas songs by contemporary Christian music artists from the late 1970s. It includes songs from established 1970's stars like B.J. Thomas, B.W. Stevenson, and Dan Peek, as well as country music legend ""Tennessee"" Ernie Ford and an early recording by a young Amy Grant. If you enjoy CCM or Christmas music, you sound enjoy this album."
5,My 8 year old Son loves it!,The price was great and I appreciate the other reviews describing that it is a small watch. It is perfect for my 8 year old. The velcro wrist band is simple to use. I did need to replace the battery. It took a little time. I found a video on youtube to show me how.
4,Delta 9 does it again,"This is a great album, David Rodgers ties the entire album together with scratching and the sounds of insanity. Not as downright blasphemous as his previous albums, no conjuring of the Unholy Trinity, etc. Also, lacking the amount of samples that are common on his other albums. But don't get me wrong, this is a great album. Play loud. Buy Alpha Decay and Disco Inferno, as well. Delta 9 is the hardest gabber dj around, probably only equaled to by Ron D Core."
4,dare 1360,Bought as a gift. Reported that all lights don't light. Shipped speedily and received in a timely fashion.
5,The book gets 5 stars. THE RESULTS GET 10 STARS.,"The other reviews of this book are absolutely on target. While the book is a ""5"", the process and results are a ""10"".This review will provide some evidence of the possibilities for your business and you personally that result from using the transformation process described in the book.Sales doubled in a no-growth market. ROI is more than 5 times the industry median. Business is now global. Employee turnover is less than 5%. Competition can't keep up. Employees actually enjoy their role, and their commitment to clients is second to none.Would you like to have results like these? Would you like to personally gain control, respect, recognition and/or approval? Want to really enjoy being a Leader? Want more time for family and outside interests? You, yourself can personally transform just as much as the business. Read this book, drink a glass of courage, and engage Tom Wentz to help. The process works beyond your wildest dreams."
1,too many air bubbles,Installing this cover is really hard and found itimpossible to remove the air bubbles on the screen.I ended up throwing the protector away because ofmy finger prints.Buy a nice shammie because this product is a waistof money.
3,oops!!,"This is a great product. It reduces glare and protects the screen from scratches. It also cuts down on the amount of dust on your screen.My only complaint is to make sure that you apply the protective filter the right way the first time. You wont have a second shot at it.Also, make sure your screen is as clean as humanly possible before applying it. Any spec of dust will show up and will become a nusance quickly.If you peel it up to resituate the filter be super carefull!!!!! Don't do what I did and drop it. I got dog hair all over it. I was unable to get all the debris of so I threw it away and bought a new one."
1,Get what you pay for.,"This just arrived in the mail and I applied it to my son's PSP. After applying the protector I was shocked to find out how EASY it was to scratch this screen protector. Not with my finger but with the actual cleaning cloth that came with it. This screen protector isn't even worth 3 bucks. No joke, right out of the gate it was smudged and scratched and was entirely from wiping it with the cloth. NOW, here's the catch, with the PSP turned on and while my son was playing a game you couldn't see the issues with the screen guard. Dark scenes in a game show it but overall you can't see it. It's only when it's turned off that this thing turns into an ugly duckling.I would avoid purchasing this protector unless you totally don't care what it looks like while turned off or dark scenes in a game. It's not resistant to scratches or smudges at all."
3,Decent play,"Certainly not Wilde at his best, but there his wit does shine through a bit. The acting is adequate. And the price is right (free!) for Prime members."
5,Every Rock Photog should own this book,Great book! It is only a buncha pics but they happen to all be iconic. iconic iconic iconic Led Zeppelin.
3,Replacement wheels for JD F935,"The package came on time and the price was good. When I went to install the wheels, I discovered that they are smaller in diameter than the originals I was replacing. I had to use some of the old washers to keep the wheels from becoming too tight against the bracket so they would spin on the axel. The model number says they are a substitute so I'm not sure what is going on. Maybe John Deer is using these as a substitute or the seller did not utilize the correct wheels as the John Deere wheels. I dropped the wheels down lower to the ground and they seem to work. Time will tell if they last."
5,I am using this book as side reader.,"I am using this book as a side reader at my bachelor's degree in Electronics Enginering. I study Electronics Engineering using Japanese language. I want to know the English description of Electronics Engineerng.Annex c, Device Characteristics are quite dated."
3,"Work okay, seem flimsy compared to my originals.","I bought these to replace some on our camper that had been broken. They fit the same, but despite what other customers reviewed, I think these feel FLIMSIER than the originals. Even though I'd prefer stainless, I guess I'd rather have these breakable for one reason: if somebody tries again to close a door or compartment with these engaged, I'd rather the holders break than ruining the door."
2,run of the mill,"I grew up on Lionel Richie's Music&He is One of the Greatest Pop songwriters in the entire History but after He reached His Solo Peak&Prime with ""Can'Slow Down"" He has been settling on alot of just kinda there Material&this Album is the latest.He still has a moment or two but on a whole it ain't what it once was."
4,Really helps you see the forest through the trees!,"I am re-reading this book and enjoying it again. Keith Miller hits the nail on the head when he talks about why so many people feel compelled to control others, ultimately to try to quiet our inner ""shaming voices,"" often left over from childhood, telling us that we are ""not enough."" Controlling others, overtly or covertly through passive-agressive behavior, are a way to assauge our feelings of inadequacy, just as are other addictions, according to Miller. Worth reading!"
4,The London Rich,"Based on the cover description and limited information available about this yet to be published book, it appears to be destined to be a very important and exciting contribution to our understanding of British social history from 1666 to the present. The book focus on the economic institutions and people that made London a center of world civilization, trade and power for over 400 years. The title alone, ""The London Rich"" conjures up all of the images of the pomp, circumstance and tradition that we associate with a city that is is a history-lover's delight. While both the role of the rich, and life-styles of the landed gentry and class structure have been addressed recently by Cannadine (1991, 1999), Brewer 1998), Stone (1988) and others in many books, the significant roles played the aristocracy and growing merchant classes in the social, political and economic development of London as a world city has not been the focus of any major text in recent years."
5,Awesome Book!!!,"Bought this for my hubby, he loves biker books. He had seem the documentary about it and loved it. If you like biker books go for it!!!!"
4,For those interested in the Quaker way,"The book is very useful to clarify the Quaker view of the life and specially the testimonies. The author shares his view of the Quaker worship and provides advice to the reader on how to listen the Light. A good comparison between the Buddhist and Quaker view of the meditation is provided.In addition to well established Quakers, probably the book can be very helpful for already attenders, relatively new members of the Religious Society of Friends and even for people just interested in know about Quakers and in how to listen the small interior voice."
4,Decent PSP UMD Carrying Case,"I purchased this PSP UMD carrying case for three reasons:1) It holds up to 8 UMDs2) It is more compact than the longer, rectangular cases that seem to be more common.3) It has a pouch on the back where I can keep an extra battery and an extra memory stick.With those three reasons, I am almost completely satisfied with this product. Only hitch is that it can be tricky at times getting the games into their sleeves inside this case. But that is my only (very minor) complaint. The outside clip is handy too."
2,It Fell Short for me,"I really wanted this book to be good, but I was disappointed. This was originally written as a Master's Thesis that got turned into a book.I was inspired to read this after visiting Yellowstone this past summer. Unfortunately, this book wasn't written to well. Names were spelled multiple ways and there were missing words in the text.I did appreciate the original text from Daniel Trotter Potts and the rest of the mountain men that Bagley cited. I think he was a little liberal with some of his facts. I know conventional wisdom always gave Colter the credit with discovering Yellowstone. I'd never heard of Potts until I went to Yellowstone.If you're all right with the misspellings and really do want to read some first hand accounts I'd say read it.Otherwise, I'd pass on this"
1,Misleading history,"Bagley strives mightily to posit his personal view that Daniel Potts, and not John Colter, was the first American to see Yellowstone. This, despite overwhelming evidence from numerous sources that Colter was, indeed, the first American to see the area. He was, in effect, the first Yellowstone tourist. Bagley summarily dismisses all this evidence to advance his theory.He presents no new information on the fur trade, merely repeats simplistically what has long been known. The Daniel Potts letters are well known to fur trade historians, and have been previously published."
4,Land That We Love.,"Though this book is filled with history, this isn't the typical history book. The book is filled with two pages stories explaining the stories behind the stories. How was the Ferris Wheel invented? Where did the hot dog come from? Ever wondered who invented the game of MONOPOLY? The common theme in each of these short tales is that they are all about America. Each story, and the book as a whole, is inspiring, uplifting, and motivating. Reading this book should fill one with awe and pride at being an American. And for those who aren't Americans, well our country always has been, is, and always will be filled with people like the ones in this book."
2,"Good idea, but flawed execution","Although this text does cover a wide range of safety topics, it is somewhat dated and contains a farly large number of typos. Therefore, the reader has to be careful. The book needs to be updated and the typographical errors corrected. If that were to be done, it would definitely be a five star book."
1,Sloooooooowwwwwwwww.........,"I have used ACT! for at least tens years or so. Sure, there are more powerful contact management programs out there, but ACT is king of the Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) philosophy. I have generally been very happy with ACT! and decided to update ACT! 2000 to ACT! 2006. I have had nothing but problems since. Installation was very difficult. But most importantly, THIS PROGRAM IS WAY TOO SLOW! Other users report ACT! 2006 sucks all computer resources, and they are not kidding. I too have very worthy computing power, but this program will bring any computer to its knees, begging to be put out of its misery. I plan to ask for my money back, but will be surprised if I am successful. My recommendation: keep version 2000 if you have it. It is far superior."
1,Slow Open... Back up... not worth it.,"What happened to Act 2006. Why upgrade ? It takes way too long for back ups, and the extra are not that great. I was glad that the pocket PC sync seems to work both ways, but it still is not worth it."
1,Stay away 8.0 wait another year at least,"I've used Act since 2.0 and it just got better right through 6.0 then the graph plummeted, it was bad, real bad. I keep 7.0 on a computer to see if it will ever get back to 6.0 performance, the only good is pre-Sage 7.0. 6.0 is a great program good enough for everybody. Maybe Sage will sell out and somebody will upgrade it back to 6.0 but till then 8.0 aint worth the aggravation, use 6.0 if you can still find it."
2,Really dumb movie,This movie is not for the faint of heart. Many very gory parts to include a human fondue. The plot is well designed but the movie has so many stupid parts like taking a vote on whether to help a friend who is being killed. Or stopping to talk when someone is chasing you to kill you. Not to mention the old having compassion and letting a mutant live who just ate your friend.
1,Thanks for wasting my time....,This Movie was horrible! The characters are stupid and usually a bad horror film has at least one smart character that is able to survive thru the end but all of them on this one were brain dead.If you like to waste your time or just like to watch people get slaughted and bleed fake orange blood then go ahead and watch this.In ten years this movie will just be another one of Americas mistakes....
5,EXCELLENT !!!,This is what i've expected from a bluray of the 20th century fox.sound 9/10 picture 10/10.One my favourite movies of the series.
2,Hard to believe.,"This book is hard to believe. There are some elemental truths in this book, like the black market trade in cotton, which some in the government sanctioned. Other things, like the two groups of fugitives going across the Potomic and the attack on Seward supposedly by his eldest is just unbelieveable. The authors roll out some sketchy facts, but not sufficient proof that an actual conspiracy took place. The alleged conspiracy itself is kind of hard to believe. The authors would have us believe that greedy businessmen, along with radical Republicans and Southern government officials combined to rid the government of Abraham Lincoln. I am not sure you could get all those people in the same room, lest agree.This is a poor book in revisionist history. I liked the review of the clandestine business deals that took place with the South. Much of the rest of the book was not very believeable."
1,Spurious sources+nonexistant reasoning=Bad history,This twaddle isn't worth the match required to burn it. Not a single source can be verified in the original.
4,Inspirational,I bought this because I was fascinated how someone like Karla could make such a change in her life.I saw a small clip of the movie based on her life and had to get the book.It was very inspirational.I gave it to a friend hoping that she too would be inspired as I was.This book shows you that with God all things are possible.
4,Noise Maker,"I like it, but people still ignore it and walk behind my truck when I am backing up. I suppose that there is no real mechanical or electronic help for stupidity."
2,Cheesy 70s Made For TV Movie!,"I remembered this movie from my childhood, seeing it on late tv. All I remembered was a flight with a group of ""Miss America"" finalists is hijacked and it starred Victoria (Dallas) Principle, Stella (Poseidon Adv)Stevens, Chuck (The Rifleman) Connors, and Gary (Hour Magazine) Collins.This movie plays like a really bad episode of Charlies Angels. Fun for the 70s nostalgia, but several scenes will definitely make you cringe. Especially the scenes that showcase the contestants ""talent""."
5,Very pleased with purchase!,Love the scent. First time to use this particular scent. Good size bottle. Fast shipper. Very pleased with purchase overall.
1,Movie Problems,"Only about 2 minutes of the movie play. The two minutes that actually play was not good, I would not recommend you purchase this item."
1,Not as good as the packaging looks,"The final product is nowhere near as nice looking as the picture of the rocket on the box cover. Expect to have to spend an hour putting it together, cutting your own decals from a square sheet of orange tape or cutting your own tail fins from a rectangle of balsa wood. The tape provided is really flimsy. My final product is held together by duct tape. If you have a kid looking for a nice-looking rocket that works, look elsewhere. If you are just looking for an experiment to display how vinegar and baking soda work interact, then this will suffice."
4,Excellent study of a complex character,"This is an excellent study of a complex and contradictory man. Understandably vilified in the heat of war, a more interesting image has appeared over time. One cannot help but admire the daring and gambler quality of a man ordered to start a war he did not agree with and risked his life to prevent. Yamamoto certainly deserves to be remembered as a grand naval commander. It's unlikely any more authoritatve work will ever emerge as the author when directly to people who knew Yamamoto in life"
2,Inscrutable,"THE RELUCTANT ADMIRAL: YAMAMOTO AND THE IMPERIAL NAVY by Kiruyuki Agawa. A biography of Admiral Isuruku Yamamoto. Not a great book. Filled with interesting information but the Japanese are very funny about World War 2. On one hand, they cheer their glorious victories over the dim bulb Americans who apparently only won the War because of their greater industrial capacity and because they somehow cheated by breaking the Japanese codes. On the other hand apparently NOBODY in Japan wanted to go to war with the United States except a couple of guys who luckily did not survive the War. Apparently Imperial Japan was a peace loving country who somehow just bombed Pearl Harbor one day.Worth reading solely from a historical perspective but not a successful book otherwise."
3,It quit working!,"4 days, and the analog portion of the watch quit working...digital and 'bug' lite work fine. (In other wods, battery is ok.) Will call today to set up an exchange."
3,Disspaointed,Beatles:London Symphony has a better DVD of the Beatles which is 100% symphonic. Rather have that one.Please send me info of that one.
3,A Bit Off,"Maybe I was expecting too much based on my reading of After All These Years and Magic Hour, but I found this a tad boring and not up to the quality of either of those two. Her writing is crisp and sharp as usual. She knows how to turn a wicked phrase and give her characters life. It's what she did with these lives that didn't grab me this time. I enjoyed some aspects of the characters and guess I was really disappointed in the way the love interests (don't want to give anything away) were handled. If you absolutely LOVE her work, you may enjoy this, but if you haven't read any take a gander at those mentioned above first"
5,FANTASTIC,Just received the Cutlery set and so far I am very happy with the quality of the knives. I am not a professional chief but I do know my way around a kitchen. I like the size and balance of the knives. They seem like a well made quality set. Hopefully they will last for a long time.
4,As amusing as it is thought-provoking,"This book was my introduction to Stanislaw Lem, which is ironic, because this is a book consisting only of introductions of other (imaginary) books. I found it completely by accident on the bargain rack, and I don't know why I bought it. But I did, and I'm certainly glad. When I started reading him, I said to myself, ""What *is* this?"" and found it all very bizarre. But Lem is one of those rare writers who makes you feel smarter just for having read him. For all that, this book is not only fascinating, but surprisingly funny at times. (How do you write an introduction to a book of introductions?) And for being so fanciful, Lem's discussions are surprisingly relevant."
1,mine broke immediately,mine broke after just a few uses. the shaft broke off right where it joins the actual core. it had been used only a couple of times. the teeth look brand new. it says made in Germany so I assume this is just a bad luck situation. when you look at the broken shaft it is obvious there was a defect in the metal.I bought another and so far it has not broken.
5,Beautiful world music in an unusuall collaboration,"World Beat is a collaboration of a diverse group of musicians on the wildly independent Dynamic Recording label - Wayra (on pan flutes) from Peru, Omar Faruk Tekbilek (world reknown percussionist from Turkey), Alfred St. John (on steel pans) from Trinidad & Tobago, and Jerry Brongo from New York. Each musician created original material for this recording and their blending of cultures/beats/backups and intonations is really unusual - soothing music, exciting music. A favorite melody of the producer - The Old Lamplighter - is a surprise and different note - played on the Steinway grand by Geraldine Elliott - with Alfred St. John whistling in the background - and the studio's dog Tramper making a (totally unrehearsed) bark at the lamplighter as he is heard making his rounds."
4,Great unit,Replaced the plugs. Just remember; points are better. They need maintenance. This is a maintenance-free solution. The acceleration curve felt the same before and after the conversion. One tip: remeber to make sure that you unplug all remnants of wiring of points so they don't ground your new unit. The motor will not start!
2,DOESNT' ADRESS SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN,"I FELT THIS BOOK WAS GEARED TOWARDS THE OLDER CHILD,MORE SO THAN TODDLERS.NEEDED A SECTION FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN."
2,Too simplistic; average at best,"This book read like most parenting magazines--simple parent/child problems as examples, with obvious solutions. There are a lot of exercises, which are more self-revealing then they are helpful in solving problems. This book reads more like a collection of methods and approaches, which could be helpful if you are exploring different approaches. A reader who is purchasing his/her first book on parent/child issues may find this book useful as a general guide, as the author provides a good source list for each approach or topic."
2,"Poor quality, but fun otherwise","My daughter received this toy and was putting the shirt on the boy doll for the first time when the doll broke apart into many pieces. She wasn't doing anything rough, but it just came apart. She's enjoying the rest of the set, but is disappointed with how quickly it breaks."
5,Cold Ridge,The story was first rate. I enjoyed reading and suggesting it to my family members as a good read. I know they will feel the same way.
3,An Okay Read,"This book left me both wanting more and wanting less. I wanted more character development. I didn't feel connected to them at all and their motivations were often unclear. Carine, the female lead, was described as this independent, strong willed woman, yet her behavior and actions often said the opposite. The plot was interesting but slow and none of the action - suspense or romance - had enough substance to really hold my interest.What I wanted less of was the unnecessary description. We're given pages of information on the scenery. We're given lots of detail on the process of becoming a pararescuer and the required skills. None of this was particularly fascinating to me and it often repeated throughout the book. The characters inner thoughts are often repeated as well, as they continually contemplate each other and the issues around them.Overall, this is a good read, though easily forgettable."
3,hard to understand,"this book is good, but it is hard for kids to understand.me being only 11 i didn't understand very much. i think u should get a guitar teacher insted."
2,Not quite as good as it looks,The company shipped a silver unit we ordered black. Did not return it. To mich hassle. The assembly was easy. Bikes need an extra bar to hang them up. Rack does save space. I would give it a c just passing.
3,Grand Cherokee Power Window Regulator (Driver),"Works like it should at a fraction of the cost of having the OEM installed at the dealer. No loss in function. Beware the plastic parts that have to carry the load (which is the part that failed on the last one). If I replace it infrequently, it still works out as a better deal."
2,lemons,"I had to order this part 3 times before finally getting one that worked. Amazon did a great job with making this easy for me to return the defective parts and to receive the replacement. The first one I had ordered worked for about 3 days before it started to emit a loud grinding sound and wasn't able to move the window up or down. The second one I received was very underpowered right from the beginning and the motor got very hot. I was reluctant to try a third time with this part but did so anyway. Its been about a month and it seems to be working fine.Another note worth mentioning, the mounting holes did not match up with the existing holes in the door. Not a hard thing to correct, but be prepared to use a drill."
5,"Hand-write a Thank-you note, people will appreciate it.","I bought these due to their simple elegance.The roughly 3 1/4""x5"" size of these cards is perfect for a quick note. The paper is a sturdy card stock so the quality is there too.Write a couple of thank-you notes, you'll be surprised by how appreciative people will be."
4,Just a wild guess,"Yeah, I'd like to know if there are 50 in the package too. I'm thinking 50 is a good number to put in the package. You can estimate there are 50 cards in the package based on the size of the box being able to hold 50 cards and 50 envelopes. But this number of 50 is just a wild, wild guess. I sure wish they would state in the product description whether there were 50 cards and 50 envelopes in this package. It would really suck ordering these thank you notes that might contain 50 cards and 50 envelopes when I have to write out 50 separate thank you notes to the 50 people who I need to thank. Don't you think?"
1,Keep Your Money,"This book is, in my opinion, worthless. Save the price and spend it on open house fliers and snacks. I am constantly amazed at the volumes of non-substansive books. They are sold to many, yet teach nothing more than general common sense items. I have found more effective methods watching used car commercials on tv. Many items are greatly misleading also. I have taught people to sell by owner for years and offer free on line seminars that put this book to total shame."
