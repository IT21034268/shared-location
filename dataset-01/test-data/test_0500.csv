2,Am I crazy?,"Or was this movie not ALL THAT!?!? I don't know if the other reviewers here were lavishing praise over something that they heard was supposed to be so good, but knowing this going in and thus prepared to love it I found myself thinking, if I didn't know this was supposed to be good I would be thinking it was terrible, and therefore I thought it was ... fine. Certainly not a classic. Mildly amusing. Not at all memorable. Perhaps it was significant re historical era in which it appeared and its place re Spanish politics etc. etc. but I wouldn't know. Standing alone, it was nothing at all special."
1,I must disagree...,"with the other reviews. I bought the DVD based on the glowing superlatives I read here, and was totally disappointed. Maybe something gets lost in the translation between Spanish and English, but I kept waiting for the hilarious, fall-on-the-floor comedy, and waiting... and waiting... I couldn't finish watching the movie, because there was no point. Halfway through I realized it wasn't going to get any better. Save your money!!"
2,"Well, at least Tracks 2, 3 & 5 are good.","What's up with the first track anyway. Anytime a progressive hosue album tries to build itself up with an ""In the beginning. . ."" track...well, that's bad news.This album is off-kilter at most points. If this really is ""The Best of House"", then maybe I should crawl back under a rock. Definitely not the house music that I enjoy listening too.On the other hand, tracks 2, 3 & 5 tell you that there are at least 3 artists worth exploring more. Darude can be quite fun, and Kernkraft is a classic for you NHL fans."
1,sucks,"my fault, didn't read how old it was.it is an older game, and i am just spoiled by age of empires."
1,when will I get it,"Ordered it on the 28th of Jan its now 27th Feb and I am still waiting to receive my purchase.They soon took the money out of my account,so if you see this review my advise is don't bother go somewhere else"
2,Not up to his usual standard,"I was delighted to bump into a Farley Mowat book in the used book store and eagerly stated reading it. I have read and reread many of his books in the last 40 years, but not this one. I could only get thru about 1/3 of it before I was dreading having to pick it up again. Really dry and quite boring in long passages. Maybe it should only have 1 star but I couldn't do that to an author of so many great books."
4,Some missing history found.,"Ever think about Christopher Columbus or Leif Erikson? Wonder about their claims? This book fills in many gaps and goes beyond ""school history"" lessons. I now have a much clearer set of thoughts about the world around me and how ancient people migrated to remote places. This is very enjoyable reading and Farley's style is easy to follow. Hard to put it down."
5,GT/California special: Recognition guide & owner's manual,Seller: PerfectGT/California special: Recognition guide & owner's manual: Perfect to Mustang GT/CS 1968
3,Learning something new,I learned something new in this book. Some book says almost the same idea but this book mentioned something I did not read in other lyric writing books.
1,Dissatisfied,"I was very dissatisfied with this DVD. It was very slow, seemed out of date and so boring that I did not finish watching it. The sound quality was terrible."
1,DON'T GET BURNED!!!,This product is a law suit waiting to happen. I am constantly getting burned from the steam coming out the opening from the lid that does not fit on snuggly. Or the lid will fall off mid pour and hit the cup and water spills everywhere. For those of you thinking DUH hold the lid on with your finger - that finger gets burned from the steam coming from the pour hole. All in all its a really bad design - good idea - bad design.Save yourself some bucks and burns and stay away from this product!!
4,"Once Upon A Crime there was a hilarious, laugh-a-minute mystery...","The film Once Upon a Crime is a classic comedy/crime film with its brilliant cast, fantastic script and plot. The performances are just so hilarious and the intertwining storylines of characters is so cleverly done, you'll laugh all the way to the twisted ending. It is a great ""Who Done it?"" that manages to hit all the right places and keep you guessing until the end. The features are a behind-the-scenes featurette and the film Trailer, and it is all very cool. If you haven't seen this film yet then don't waste any time and see for yourself just how good this is."
2,Plastic Junk,"The whole machine twists when you put the grounds in. This is not what you are expecting at all. Please steer away from this machine or you will be disappointed. I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews for this machine because it is FAR beneath the level of quality I expected.I ordered this machine for my girlfriend for Christmas and when we set it up it was terrible. She remarked: ""Careful!! The whole thing is twisting!"" ...and promptly asked if we could ship it back.What an embarrassment!Also, I bought it through Amazon btw of UnbeatableSale.com and they are also a nightmare! UnbeatableSale.com does not care if you are not happy with their products, regardless of what their website claims. They do not answer their phone and are giving me a complete run around about returning the product.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!You will not be happy with it."
2,not what it appears!,"I was very disappointed in this book! I was hoping for a light mystery, but this book is not a mystery novel. Where they came up with the title is beyond me. However, it's not a bad book, it just doesn't deliver if you are wanting a good mystery. For better Christian fiction, I would definitely recommend Lisa Samson's Women's Intuition, or Club Sandwich, which both show much more depth of character and less predictability."
3,Rin-a-Ding-Don't,"I've always liked this album since I first heard it in the sixties. This particular version has been digitally re-mastered, but badly. The horns have a very harsh and narrow kind of sound, which ruins the whole thing for me. I would recommed an earlier CD version, or the vinyl, if you can find a clean copy."
5,"""Difinitive Sinatra!!""","From the opening number it is obvious that Sinatra sounds different on this album to any of his previous Capitol recordings. He has a confidence and attitude in his voice that no other album before or after has managed to capture. Listen to ""Let's Face The Music & Dance"", ""A Foggy Day"" and ""I've got my love to keep me warm"". These songs will never be sung better than this. Each song is a bench-mark performance and Sinatra creates difinitive versions of the songs. I place this album on the same level as ""September Of My Years"". This is one of the best Sinatra albums available and is ""ESSENTIAL""."
4,Ring a ding ding,"Nicely done work by Frank with the usual club atmosphere flare. Good, clean recordings with strong band background support."
2,Sad remaster.,I bought this cd with great expectation. It was lauded as the best sounding Sinatra album since being re-mastered. I am an audiophile. As a music lover this album represents some of Frank's seminal work. It is a powerhouse of hits! What better to be taken from master tape to the digital domain in modern fashion. Well if this is what the master tape sounds like WHOA! they liked highly exacerbated treble! The cd starts with the title tracks trumpets blairing. And me running for the volume knob. Meanwhile I read forums where this is extolled as a most wonderfull music experience. Maybe I got a bad cd?
2,inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan. AND JESUS IS OUR SAVIOR,i have seen the anmerican version of varen and i kept thinking it was going to be good cause i was a huge toho fan and i never really trust anyone's reveiws but no! i went ahead and spent 10 BUCKS!! ON IT. it wasen't a bad movie but the healy version relly messed it up. can't to get this version.
5,"Durable, attractive bag","We've been using this for years and it's still holding up like new. No problems with any of the zippers, pouches, etc. Wonderful!"
1,"Car 54, Where Are You???","No. Not this piece of dreck ""movie"". Where (or when) will the humorous series be available on DVD? Just about every TV show imaginable has had a DVD release (wheither desired or not). Car 54 and, until recently, Sgt. Bilko were nowhere to be found. Poor Ernie Bilko gets a ""best of"" rather then a richly deserving season by season treatment. By the way, instead of that very rotten Car 54 movie, you'll get more yucks staring at a clock. A stopped one at that. The makers of this mess should be arrested. Avoid at all costs."
1,"nipsey russel, where is your pride?","I was given this by a man who cannot read or do simple math. He lives on the end of my block. I drive him places because he does not have a car. He gave it to me because he said, ""this is terrible."" When a man of that social standing says something's terrible, it is. This is horrible. Why didn't they take the money to make this and feed starving children instead? If you own this (and you're not me), you owe society big time, and the starving children, too."
5,"Very good, maybe great","Well, I have listened to the cds, and they're awesome. The song selection is great, very rockin'. The downside is Eddie's voice, which sounds a little weary and worn. He's straining a bit and so melodious, it ain't. But if you like your live stuff raw and basic, a great show."
1,Poor quality and wrong book,"The book had the cover almost off, just hanging on by a small amount of paper. Worse still, it was the wrong book. They sent Thomas' Calculus, 10th ed., Early Transcendentals instead of Thomas Calculus 10th ed."
5,a lifesaver,"I love this product, I got one for free with my diaperbag (as a new mom, I would have NEVER thought of this) and I couldn't imagine not having it. Who knew that one would need randomly sized bags often once a baby is born. Its great for soiled diapers, soiled clothes, spit up cloths, wet clothes, etc. . . . A definite must have and its so small you can leave it in your diaperbag and forget about it."
1,Totally different package,"What I received is different from the picture, it,s grey tube with white cap, inside is black trash bag, looks very cheap."
2,"Hard to use, didn't make destination seem inviting","The information may have been there (although we're not positive about that), but we found it hard to use. The presentation also did not make going there seem inviting. We returned it and purchased Fodor's, with which we're much happier."
2,Not as good as I expected,"While I love the title track and Ooh La La, the rest of the songs I could do without - especially ""Shelly My Love,"" which I thought was one of the worst songs I've ever heard Rod sing. I didn't think this CD was as good as ""Spanner in the Works."""
2,Popylupyshoopy,"This new CTD album, or should I say Brad Roberts album, is decent. Not as bad as the messy and shallow (yet strangely intriguing) Give Yourself a Hand, but nowhere near as rich and emotionally charged as the first 3 CTD albums (all classics, especially A Worm's Life). My problem with the new Dummies image is. . .WHERE ARE ALL THE STORIES??? The earlier albums always contained Brad's quirky tales about household appliances, Biblical figures, garbage, scabs, ducks, pulling teeth, etc. I'm all for groups reinventing themselves, but these songs are just too cynical and commonplace to warrant multiple listenings."
2,"Sophomoric, apish","NOT the best alt-country I've heard. If you want the real deal, check out bands like Split Lip Rayfield, the Bottle Rockets, Kings of Leon, or a band in No Depression magazine.This EP kind of sounds like a bunch of young kids who dress in flannel shirts and listen to way too many John Mellencamp records. Maybe they'll get better with age, but right now they're light-years away from what this type of music is about."
1,ATTENTION TO DETAIL,"I ordered the Tyson Premium Chunk White CHICKEN BREAST. I receieved the Tyson Premium Chunck White Chicken. Though they are similar, they are not the same. I don't have the time to send it back and wait for another shipment so I will accept it. Attention to detail is very important."
2,Not at all what I was looking for,"While ""1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work"" was an interesting read at first but I eventually put it down for several weeks before forcing myself to continute.While some stories can give at least a hint of an idea if not an actual suggestion on how to step up on the job, 98% of this book seems redundant and lacking. If you're looking for, as on reviewer said, ""Chicken Soup for the Employee's Soul"" you've found it. If you are looking for something to guide you into being a better employee and coworker, move on."
2,"Small, but significant defect after about 3 weeks of wearing","After no more than three weeks of wear, one of the metal rings (attached to the black patch of fabric on the side) holding the laces came off, so I am currently looking for return options. Really good product overall, but now unusable due to something like this."
2,Inadequate for the job,"This heater is simply too small to defog windows or provide much heat. Perhaps alarger unit wouild drain teh battery too much. It does a samll amount of defogging, but not an even noticable amount and only after considerable time."
4,"Fine machine, doubtful company","We have used a Bennoti machine for at least two years with no problems. It is extremely simple to use. Two suggestions: do not run machine when water has run out; prime the cup by using the previous capsule to half fill with warmed watery coffee-- then change capsule, throw out the watery coffee and fill for real.As for the company, there has been too much posted on various websites to ignore. We bought directly from Bennnoti with no trouble, but others have reported problems. We buy capsules from Amazon or Richardsolo. I imagine that buying machine via Amazon would be best because you would have access to their customer service which has always impressed us."
1,scarlet,this is the bigest waste of money! the coffee cartridges are a rip off and the postage and packaging a scandal!
5,Amazing Machine,This machine really works! Perfect espresso every time and the steamer foams milk better than I expected. Would buy this machine again.
4,Good espresso machine,"Very solid body, quick start to make my first espresso. Still learning... But, overall, easy to use."
3,Not bad.,"Well played for the most part. Some of the vocals seem as if they belong on a different cd. Much better results than Ribot's involvement with the Lounge Lizards (why do those guys get so much attention for their reheated, ironic, fatally hip noodlings?)."
2,Good luck next time,"I am a lover of Ribot's guitar. I really think he is a genius (well, John Zorn is of the same opinion), but definitively the genius is not present in this record. What you will find is a total lack of swing and latin feeling, an almost pathetic percussion, no inspiration and a guitar without any pretension to show any imagination. I think Marc should listen to Cooder's Buena Vista Social Club, that is a gem that I feel shows the pace to those willing to penetrate the feeling of Cuban music."
5,Great Bubblegum lasts forever!,"Yes,yes,yes!The 1910 F.C. had some of the catchiest,fun pop music EVER!Sure,it's debatable who played/sang on what,but who cares?The great songs are what matters and this is a top-notch collection of ""their"" best stuff!Rock on,Bob PS:INDIAN GIVER is one of the best songs of all time!"
1,ramblings of a madman,Almost nothing in this book is real and the conclusions this nutjob derives from his astoundingly bigoted viewpoints is that Christians have to help usher in a world war to murder all of the Jews so that his fictionalized christ can return to lalaland. These people are nuts.
3,Depends on what you like,"These kids are funny, and catchy. Personally not a fan though. Although they are absolutely HUGE over here in the Uk. If you like pop music, this is a definate. And its true, busted will be around for years to come. Just felt i had to say to the person who said he listens to ""non-uk groups"". A little discrimination there my friend. You talk like the uk produces bad music. I think you maybe forgetting such greats as The Rolling Stones and The Beatles."
4,Good Fun-packed CD,"These young Brits have produced one of the best pop albums in the last couple of years. They know how to put together crunching pop songs and even some of the slower songs have melodies that don't grate the ears. Actually, these guys are savvy - a lot of their tunes in the future will find their way onto many a teen movie and bring them some big royalty cheques.Best songs on the album:Britney - very cheeky lyrics. ""Sweatin all over your video, whatchin every single scene in slo-mo, trackin you down on the Internet cos I ain't seen you naked yet!""What I go to Skool For - a crackin tune about lust. - ""I fought ma way to fronty of class, to get the best view of her...I dropped a pencil on the floor, she bends down and shows me more..""Crash and Burn - their first Uk no 1, but not their best tune.Year 3000 - great tune, with pretty wacky lyrics and a super hook.Other tunes I liked - Psycho girl, losing you. The others I didn't care for, but still a very good first album."
1,THE NEIGHBOURS BUSH ON YOUR FACE,"Heh, why the hell do you have your neighbours bush as your eyebrows? and also all your songs have the same tune, boring. Busted, you nearly killed my gerbil when she heard you sing!"
4,"""Old School"" Fun!","Who thought throwing a plastic ball could be this much fun. Just like I remembered from 25 years ago. These ""racquets"" allow you to throw for a mile! Risers, sinkers, curves, or just go deep. Only bummer is that they no longer come with the foam ball that you could curve 20 feet."
4,This Movie is halairious!,"Black Gestapo was made in 1975, and it was very low budget. Honestly, I think that the camera work is terrible, but I give it 4 stars stil- for a reason. The movie is about a group of black people who become angry at the racist views of these idiodic white cops. So they form a group, and at first it kind of sounds like they want to promote peace a equal rights, but it turns out they are really just causing violence. This movie is fun to watch though because the fighting scenes are very humorous, I really am not sure if they are supposed to be or not though. It is not supposed to be funny, but you will laugh at the very fake and very amplified punch sounds in the fight scenes, and the 70s funk music while they fight. This movie is very violent, very low budget, there are a lot of mistakes, and has a lot of unnecisary nudity in it, but it is worth a laugh!"
5,Futuristic detective novel.,"Excellent character developement. It is a rescue story, and a tale of survival. Based on this book I read St.John's other two. I like them a lot, but this is my definite favorite. It is a steal at the price! P.S. Eugenics, and the consequences, are fascinating. Are they really people?"
3,Solid album by a great band,This album is worth the money but not worth going out of your way for. Casting Crowns is an incredible band. They are hands down the second best band in Christian music. The best band is Leeland. This of course is opinion. There are some good songs on this album such as East to West and I Know You're There. However they are weighed out by songs like Prayer for a Friend and the title track (which was written on the way to the studio). You definitely know it's Mark and the Crowns from track 1 but they seem to have gotten softer and more southern. Maybe this appeals to some but it drives me away. If I wanted to listen to light pop I'd listen to Rebbecca St. J's. Buy the new Leeland album before this. They are the new face of Christian music.
4,Last One Not On CD,"This is that last Mystic Moods Orchestra album that hasn't, to my knowledge, made it to CD. Hope it finally does at some point."
5,Sets the Standard For Nonprofit Fund Development Books,"My title says it all. This is the only book fund development professionals need to buy. Standard and creative ideas are both proposed and are workable. I'd had mine for years, gave it to someone and bought another one. Don't waste your money on anything else."
5,Active Learning!,GREAT! Active Learning--learn while doing the best! Love watching my granddaughter in motion. We can even do it together(young and old)
2,Didn't get Attention of Rambunctious Tot,"I too am amazed at all the 5 star reviews for this DVD. That is why I bought it. This one is completely opposite to another one we have: Yoga kids: Silly to Calm. My rambunctious 2.5 year old isn't capable yet of following directions too well with either of them (even with me doing the DVD with him- he gets excited and runs around me while I do this poses lol)but this one doesn't get his attention even for a second. The kids that ""love, love love"" this DVD must have been doing yoga since birth. Maybe that is why they love the austerity of it. The other DVD shows kids of various ages doing the poses at their own level, outside at the beach. Its nice to imagine we are a part of that. I am a bit incredulous that others say their 2.5 year olds are shouting ""I am capable"" along with this DVD."
2,Warm here cold there,"It may be just because I have a glasstop stove, but I find that this pan does not cook evenly."
4,Good product. Food sticks.,We are pleased with the purchase process and the product. It is well made and of high quality. My only complaint is that clean up was tougher than I had expected. After cooking a steak the char and grease gets stuck in the groves. Not a big problem but I'd prefer easier clean up like when using Teflon.
4,grill pan,caphalon products are great--this one a good alternative to outside grilling of meats and veggies to keep calories down. easy to clean
1,"Witless, charmless, unimpressive. Except for Hamlin's abs.","Truly awful, this. Bacall has all the subtlety and comic timing of...well, Lauren Bacall when miscast and misdirected. John Mahoney has some redeeming moments, and Harry Hamlin (in the John Barrymore role) isn't really half-bad; once you accept that his character would do shirtless stomach crunches to impress his young girlfriend. (Sure, Barrymore was brilliantly hammy...but never beefcake. Nobody ever asked to see HIS abs.) All in all, an embarrassment that isn't even Bad Campy Fun. It's just Bad."
1,Disappointing,"Although the premise is interesting, the resulting memoir is less than satisfying. I found it neither humorous nor heartening, and altogether pointless. The author seems more concerned with appearances than with real depth and insight.I find it hard to believe that this book has gotten such raving reviews; it's unsettling to imagine what else people are reading if this book is considered five star."
4,Audible autobiography of Thomas jefferson,"Very informative educational, great for audial learners. Very detailed descriptive life of Thomas Jefferson and his many inventions along with family history and indiscretions"
3,Informative but brief.,"Mr Jefferson seemed reluctant to really delve into his life. He was such a brilliant gentleman, inventer, statesman, writer, who had his peers admiration. However, I felt his life was not as brief as his book and should have presented much more to the reader."
3,Our History,"This was a small, interesting book, but I found it a difficult read, due to the language used back then. Very different from today's speech. I was rather disappointed that it did not include some of his earlier life."
2,DO NOT BUY IT!NOT 60 MINUTES!,"AMAZON DID NOT PUT THIS IN SEARCH ENGINES RIGHT, IT'S NOT 60 MINUTES TAPE, ITS BAD ANYWAY!"
4,Adorable yet sturdy,"A great value. Sturdy, weather resistant material that isn't flimsy. The manufacturer recommends bringing it in during heavy winds. We didn't and the umbrella came loose. We found it in our yard & re-attached it no problem. It hasn't come loose since. The umbrella spins but the duck doesn't turn as easily as the fish does on the fish model by this manufacturer. No regrets on this purchase."
4,Research Strategies for Advanced Practice Nurses,Good book to help guide nurses new to doing research for their advanced degrees. Helps to focus in on strategies and topics instead of blindly doing the studies.
1,Bad for Dancing,"I bought this ""album"" because they had a bigger section at the record store than N'Sync even though I had never heard of this ""band"". Let me just say I can't figure how these guys dance to this ""music"" on stage. The CD set didn't even have any pictures of the band in snappy outfits looking hot in a non-threatening way. Luckily the store let me exchange this CD set for some real music by O-Town.Good luck next time Pearl Jam."
1,Trashy (though somewhat fun),"This is, presumably, a melodramatic potboiler that Louisa wrote to pay the bills and then thought better of publishing; too bad it's been revived now, as the utterly shallow characterization, cloying dialogue, and stereotyped plot might give some people the wrong impression of Alcott's skills. However, it can be a fun audiobook to listen to while you are puttering around the house and don't have to listen too closely to it, or it can be a good read for a rainy day. If you like the typical Gothic novel, you may love this book. If you are looking for the fine writing and good cheer of _Little Women_, or the detailed treatment of women's lives in _Work_, or an unconventional heroine (Rosamund is supposedly spirited and unconventional, but in fact she is depressingly shallow and dull), don't bother with this one."
5,Scenes from a Marriage,"Bergman's ambitious, profound chronicle of love, selfishness, regret and missed connections that often characterize matrimony, and indeed, male-female relations. Long and demanding, but richly rewarding, the film's impact lies less in its portrayal of a subtly stagnating union than in the nuanced nature of the couple's interactions after the marriage is over. An Ingmar peak. Stay with this-it's worth it."
3,CD Rack,"Good product, sturdy, kind of hard to put together, directions werent the best but glad I got it."
1,HATE! HATE! HATE!,"THIS HORIBLE LITTLE BOOK IS THE KIND OF MEAN-SPIRITED, REPUBLICAN HATRED WE NEED TO FIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY! THIS IS A DANGERROUS BOOK! IF I COULD I WOULD BURN EVERY ONE OF THEM AND THE AUTHOR WITH THEM! HE SHOULD BE STRUNG UP, THAT WHITE RASIST! NOW THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON IS OUT OF OFFICE, WHO WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT HATE SPEECH LIKE THIS MEAN, MEAN, AWFUL LITTLE BOOK?"
4,Serendipity strikes!,"I just happened to see this at a friend's apt and picked it up. I couldn't put it down! Had to borrow it. This is funny stuff. Absurd as anything I've read, but FUNNY!"
1,Awfull. Spend your Money somewhere else,"The only worth this book has is that it provides a comprehensive list of BAPI currently available in SAP. Otherwise, it's a complete waste of time and money."
1,I wouldn't buy it again....,"1. This product comes with an instruction manual that is in Chinese only.2. The LCD screen is very dark, making it difficult to see anything on it (i.e. even when set at max. brightness -- it either has no backlight or, if there is one, it is very weak).3. The audible voice pronunciations are very poor and hard to understand (both in Chinese and in English).4. The batteries that came with the product died within only couple of hours of use -- replacement batteries have lasted a couple of weeks, so far (i.e. the product doesn't drain the batteries excessively, but the included baterries are junk).5. I would not recommend this product even for half the current selling price...."
5,Ain't technology grand?,"1 GB of memory for my phone for under $12? Unbelievable. My first computer had an 80 MB hard drive. 80 MB! And it had Microsoft Word and dozens of other software programs on it. Can you say software bloat? Anyway. Slip this little fingernail sized chip into your cell phone and store images, songs or video. Adapter and chip worked great in my computer to download images/songs and play on my phone, an LG VX8350. The adapter works like it should. Finding someplace to store miniature components so they don't disappear is the biggest challenge here."
1,WORST CUT OUTS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't waste your $$$ on these. My family is having fun laughing at the cutouts. My daughter is taking pics of them and sending them to her friends. You can't even tell what they are supposed to be they are so puffy. I reduced the heat from 375 to a moderate oven (350) like most cookies, which helped them to bake more evenly, however they still look ridiculous."
5,An outstanding book,The kid who ran for president it was an awesome book. I liked the book so so much. It was such a good book that i read it in two days. It wasn't as long as i wanted it to be tough. The aurther used really good descripition and dialoge. I rated this book a five. In the begain of then story his best friend told him that he should run for presidet. At first he thought that his friend was insaine. But then he found out that he had the kids on his side. He is low in the votes in the middle of the book. But then he gives a speech and now he is RUNNER UP with 38% vote. To find out if he wins the race read the book. I highly recomend it to fourth graders.
3,Let The Kid Talk,"Judson Moon is tring to run for president his friend Lane isrunning the campain .They get on the balot in Wiconsin.Judson'srunning mate is an old woman in a wheel chair.Now they needtwenty million dolors.So kids from all over the country sendin money to Judson.On the debate Judson's mind goes blank andhe does't remember anything.And gives silly ansers at his speach.Then he finds an article in the paper that he put a boys sociolstudies paper in the sewer.Nigel Groce-wright Richmond,VA"
3,June Moon,"I thought the book was funny . I like it because he thought that everything was the grownups fault . He said that if he was president, he would say that there wasn't going to be homework any more.I recommend that kids should read this book because it has a lot of funny parts in it .You can learn what grownups do to get a lot of votes.I can tell you it is a book that makes people laugh. Lane is a great character.The kids would really like his funny speeches. Judson's mom and dad didn't listen when Judson told them that he was running for president .Then when on the tv they said he was running for president his parents were shocked.Most kids would understand how Judson felt has he was running for president.Giulia RussellRichmond VA"
4,Exellente!!,Beautiful guitar music for the mind and the soul. This instrumental guitar music is able to transport you to the most beautiful places of the Andes. Raul Garcia Zarate is an exellent peruvian guitarist who puts feeling in his music.
3,Perfect Wife - NOT!,"I enjoyed the book, but the title seems to be a diss to other first ladies. How can a woman that killed her boyfriend by running a stop sign be perfect? How can something like that in your background make one perfect? Nor do I think putting up with a heavy drinker and exposing the Children to that, for years is a good trait! It just goes to show ya, that Put up and Shut up in reality is what most Republican men finds attractive in a wife. Sad!"
1,Nothing New Here,"There was nothing in this book that hasn't already been written about Mrs. Bush. Boring, boring book. As far as the car accident goes, it was an accident, but I know had it been me, I would have served jail time. Enough said."
1,disappointing,"What could have been an interesting, in depth book was not. Some issues were covered with many words, others passed over. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,it irritates my skin,"I bought this about a week ago.The first couple of days shown real improvement but on the 3rd day when i put on step one it burns my skin.I was afraid to put it on again,it hurt that bad.now i have a rash in two different spots.I might not use it again.i rated it a 3* because it does work but its really hurts.Its well worth it if you have bad acne breakouts.I dont have that many.I only reccomend it if you really need it."
1,Doesn't work...went back to Proactiv,"I tried this product as an alternative to Proactiv, which I've been using for about 5 years. I thought it would be more convenient since I can buy this system from the grocery store, instead of ordering online. I used it for about two months, and from the beginning, the acne that had been well-controlled on Proactiv came back. I never saw any relief while using the Neutrogena system. Clears acne in 4 days? I think not! I soon went back to Proactiv, which works perfectly for me."
2,"Itchy, Bumpy Rash","I started using this product two days ago, and woke up this morning with an itchy, bumpy rash! I had problems with benzyol peroxide 9 years ago, but thought it might be time to try it again, especially with the good reviewds on this product. I truly did notice the acne clearing up in just these two days, so I hate that I have to stop using it! Maybe, like other users, I'll have to use it every other day. If you don't have a problem with benzyol peroxide, this may be your dream product!"
3,Really need to add in a toner,"I really like this combo, but I feel like you really have to add in a toner in order to exfoliate the dead cells off; otherwise, the regimen does not work."
3,Didn't work as well as ProActive for me,"My acne is not bad. If I stay away from dairy and get enough sleep I usually don't have a problem. Please tell me who gets enough sleep...... Thank you! Even though Proactiv is expensive it does work for me.... thought I would try cheaper Neutrogena to see if it works, and I have to say it does but not consistently - which is of course the whole point. If I were to go off to a Monastery where red face spots wouldn't matter then I could take this, but Proactiv has a better success rate for me.The micro-beads in the Neutrogena skin washer are too micro to really do anything for me. Also, with the Proactiv 2nd step - the reactivating toner (really meaningless name) - when used with a cotton swab, actually takes more dirt away from my face even after I've used Proactivs Face cleanser (first step) and it has better microbeads than Neutrogena.I'd say bottom line Neutrogena better than plain soap, but not a consistent winner for me. Gonna stick w/Proactiv"
2,Not for people with sensitive skin!!!,"I have always loved Neutrogena products, so I thought this one would be no different. Boy, was I wrong! After only 2 uses my face, especially my chin and jawline, is completely dried out and itches like crazy. I didn't even realize my skin was sensitive until I used this product."
5,Worked almost immediately - very impressed!,"Ordered this for my 14-year-old daughter who experienced pretty bad breakouts two weeks before school started. She started using it one day, and there was a noticeable improvement the next. Two days later, her face was almost clear and her skin tone was smooth and nearly flawless. She has finished most of the kit and we're about to order another. The only minimal ""problem"" was that during the first week of use, the skin around her eyes got extremely dry (she didn't realize there was no need to use the treatment lotion near her eyes) but she just used extra moisturizing lotion in those dry areas and was fine. So yes, it might dry your skin out initially (that's kind of the point), but her skin has looked great for a month, she's gotten multiple compliments from fellow students and friends, and we like these products so much we might actually do the ""subscribe"" option and have it delivered regularly so she never runs out."
2,Did not work well for me,"I was hopeful after reading some of the other reviews of this system that it might be less expensive, more effective than Proactiv. This was not the case for my skin. Maybe I was sensitive to some of the ingredients in the Neutrogena system or maybe it just didn't work for me, but either way ruptions began occurring when I used it. I noticed the pores on my nose seemed to be enlarging with continued use. I found that my skin did not feel clean after using the cleanser; as if a residue were left behind. The night cream seemed to get absorbed completely but the day cream remained slightly tacky feeling like it was sitting on top of my skin. I used the system a couple of weeks assuming that maybe my skin just needed to adjust - the eruptions didn't stop. I wish this had worked as it is a fraction of the cost of Proactiv."
4,Just started using it,"I just began using this less than a week ago and I have already seen improvement! I understand that everyone is different and your skin may not react to this treatment as well as others but so far I am seeing great results!I have combination skin, it gets oily throughout the day and I have to use oil blotters at time, but at the same time it can also get very dry! It's not terribly sensitive, but it leans more to that side.I was afraid that this product would dry out my face and although it does dry it out a little bit initially, the lotion has really helps to balance out the Ph in the skin!This product has already been clearing up my acne and I am so far very happy! Hopefully it will keep on working!2 thumbs up!"
2,did work for me,when i first got this it worked a little but i started using acnefree serve acne treatment and it is working amazingly for me i have used proactiv in the past and worked wonders but for the price and having to have a membership i quiet using it and started searching for the next best thing and acnefree was the best hands done u can get a sulfar refining mask and a deep cleaning scrub with the acnefree and it works as good or almost better then proactiv u have to try it what is there to lose except the break outs
1,caution,"This product burned my skin. I used it at night and the next morning I felt and looked as if I gas a sunburn. My face felt hot, was puffy, and itchy. I imediately stopped using it. But my scts kin was still irretated for days afterwards and turned into a got a dry rash. I've never had a problem with neutragena products before. If you buy this product for the first time, I would recomend testing it on a small portion of skin before applying it to your face."
4,Good stuff but not for me.,"Around this is a great product if you don't have sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin and this stuff irritated it. My cheeks became exremely dry and chapped. The lotion is the one weak point, it was no help because it doesn't moisturize. After the irritation went away it made my skin clear up and my blackheads shrink. My skin is just too sensitive for it."
1,Had a bad experience,"I used these products for a few days when the skin under my eyes started to burn, turned very red and started to swell. Apparently I got the product too close to my eyes, but I always considered Neutrogena products to be mild. It took about two weeks for the area under my eyes to get back to normal using petroleum jelly to sooth the burning and Benadryl to ease the reaction symptoms. Unfortunately, all three products went in the garbage."
4,"works quickly, dries out skin","I purchased this kit for my teenage daughter who suddenly developed a bit of acne at the age of 15. I'm thinking it's a hormone surge. Anyway, this product worked pretty much overnight. It is very drying but very effective. We are pleased with the results. Four stars as opposed to five is for the drying factor but I'm thinking it wouldn't work otherwise."
3,Only if you like slow.,"I'd heard some nice things about Crawford so I bought Petroleum Man and put it at the top of my read. He writes with intelligence, humor and a sharpened wit. But after several chapters I still wasn't sure if I knew the story or I didn't care. An old man writing about his grandchildren and the gifts he's given them? So? Either way the start was slow and I put it down. Nice words but who cares?"
2,"Bowhunter tells a little know story, but isn't that good..","Altman's Bowhunter is loosely based upon an incident where white people are killed by the Utes in 1879. Altman's portrayals of Bowhunter and the Utes are very flat. Bowhunter hates all Indians and doesn't trust them. The Utes are shown as nasty, but having some cause to be upset. Only the dying Ute chief is shown to have some redeeming qualites and he is only there for a few of the last 30 pages."
1,Don't waste your money...I surely didn't,"This might be one of the most god-awful ""songs"" out there"" A) She doesn't sing and B) What in the hell is she talking about. ""How come everytime you come around my london london bridge wanna go down."" I can't even listen to the whole song at once because I wonder how she is possibly making any money off this cr*p!"
2,Where is the love??,"Fergie is just not the same without the rest of the Peas. Sure, her voice is beautiful, but I'm just not feeling it. Where is the love?? with the Peas, they were sing that song, which I love. But now she is singing about things as far away from love as possible. Fergie, your a gorgeous, talented person, but this song isn't one of your bests."
4,"Get it for the color charts, if you're seriously penciling!","Borgeson is here to some extent getting over slow techniques which some of us never acquired, like feeling that any area has to be built out of three colors, rather than using a dead straight one out of the box if it fits. But there is lots here on choosing papers, working imprimatura, and other methods that let you complete projects larger than a notepad in much less than four months. Good appendices on how Derwent and Prismacolor pencils match or don't, and where Prismacolor hues fall on a detailed color chart."
3,Only 5 tracks?!,"Hmm. Album art looks a lot like Killswitch Engage's ""The End Of Heartache. These guys sound pretty good. I might just check them out."
4,Flabbergasted by the self censorship,"After a very great effort, I was able to get a copy of this from a local library--it took months on inter-library loan. Let me get this straight--""Down There"" press has (in the past) published works involving knives, bondage, group sex, gender roles, and more...and backs down because SOME author's voices on the subject of race (especially interracial couplings) and cultural ""norms"" RE sex (including polygamy in Islamic nations) are ""controversial?"" Shame on the publisher for chickening out on this great collection. News flash, PC morons: If you ever dated outside of your ethnic group, it IS an issue in the relationship, whether your hemp-jeans farmers-market bamboo-flooring-in-your-million-dollar-apartment psyche wants to realize it or not. Hopefully some party braver than you will pick this up and finally get it out there."
1,If you like buying parts 2200 is perfect.,"I have owned this printer for 6 months now. I got it for a small home office where I could print invoices (black and white) and print color without hooking up my inkjet. I liked the fact that it had a 500 sheet paper tray and prints quickly. For the price I did not know what to expect, but I have quickly found out. If you want a disposable color laser printer this is the printer to get. I am still on the origional color toner cartridges and I replaced the black toner about a month ago. The oil roller has been replaced as well as the opc drum. For the price of toner and parts it is cheaper to buy a new printer keep to old one and maybe you will get lucky and a different part that did not break on the first one will go first and you will have the part. I also own the minolta 2300dl it prints a much better picture in color than the 2200. If I knew the problems with this one I would not have bought the 2300."
1,"Get Ready to PAY, PAY, PAY!","I've owned the Minolta Desklaser 2200 for 1.5 years. My first printer had a motherboard crash within 6 months!I had just refilled the printer with toner, $500.00, and a $275.00 Transfer Belt.....Minolta paid for a new machine which has run OK so far. Now it needs a new Transfer Belt....there goes another $275.00.Did I mention how quickly you will be paying for Oil Rollers? We run through one every couple of months!! They are $50.00 a pop.The quality is good but this machine is designed to eat you out of house and home.Get ready to pay when you buy one of these babies!!!!"
3,Here's the Skinny,"Love the fact that I was able to print 7000 color pages with it. Pretty good quality. Can't beat color copies for 15 cents a page.Just replaced the Black Cartridge last week, This week the Oil Roller went out. It is going to cost me more then the printer to do the 7500 copy replacements. It is a power hog. When it prints the lights dim.I'm going to buy another one because it's cheaper then fixing this one and Buying the four toner cartridges."
4,After first outing,Excellent camp stove. Handles rough surfaces well. Still lit with match when covered in frost. Make sure to invert both the cooking grates when you close it so that you don't bend the sparking sparker.
1,Cheap product from China.,"I own and have owned many quality Coleman stoves. This is not one of them. The second time that I used it, the wind sent the heat towards the plastic handle and melted the igniters and the handle! Now I find out that those parts needed are not available from Coleman! I still use my white gas two-burner stove that I bought over 40 years ago! This thing lasted 3 months!!! I will never buy another Coleman product again. Quality products have been replaced with cheap, throw-away products imported from China. Farewell, Coleman."
3,Not what it seems,"The cover of this book excited me, but when I received it, the decorations and ideas were very basic and child-like. It was disappointing as the cover gave an indication of exactly what I was looking for, but the insides failed to ignite! Good recipes for frosting etc, but unfortunately not as good as it looked!"
3,Misleading picture,"Product finish and material quality looks good, but the product picture is misleading. (Of course the manufacturer's website also does not have a realistic photo of the item).I was looking for a basket type tub strainer that has holes on both bottom and sides and hangs on its egges instead resting on its base so that water drains quickly. When the strainer rests on its base some of the drain holes are blocked and hence water does not drain quickly. I could not find a strainer that has holes on the bottom as well as sides in the 1-3/8inch size. This pictures appears as if it has holes on the side wall too, but the actual product has holes only on the base. Item itself is inexpensive but shipping is not cheap.A realistic photo of the item is a must for an item sold online. I took a chance, and it did not work."
3,Detail but dated and incompleted,"This book is focus on putting new veneer or laminated board on old cabinet, not what I was looking for as refacing the existing face with stain or new paint. Even on the subject of installing new cabinet face, it lacks the final finish (clear coat, stain)suggestion. The pictures are way dated and not inspiring. it's a good wood work book, but not very helpful if you want to evaluate different options to modernize your kitchen such as sanding and painting the existing panels."
2,Inaccurate Title,"As Arthur Dent would not doubt say, ""Ah, this is obviously some strange usage of the word 'horror' that I wasn't previously aware of."" And the only way this book could cause my hair to raise would be if I were to drop it on my toe."
2,save your money,"Just finished forcing myself to read this book only because I can't start and not finish. Boring! There are only about 20 stories worth reading and out of 100 that's just not enough. Most of the stories are cliche and predictable, the title of this book (hair raising) is just plain a lie."
1,Could not finish due to racism,"We took it until we just couldn't take it. What funny parts there were in this movie were obliterated by white stereotyping. We couldn't finish it. So tired of seeing the same unimaginative, lazy, fallback theme of making white people (any and all white people) the villain. Especially the way this movie does it casually like its okay. This is a dangerous movie that perpetuates racism against a group of people because they are not the color of another group of people. We work too hard for our money and work very hard being fair to all people to be abused because of the color of our skin by a movie that disguised itself as entertainment."
1,Waste of time,"The preview looked good but after about 30 minutes of watching, we all felt it was a waste of time and gave up. The 10 yr old sports fan and the teenager were the last to leave the room, but with the same feeling as the rest of us. Too many other good 4 star choices. Doesn't seem like this should be among them."
1,REHASH,"A great book but only if you own no others on bead or ribbon work. This is NOT new material. It's a compilation of projects from numerous other books by a variety of artists/authors. I truly hate it when publishers do this, especially as there is no indication that this is merely a rehash and not new stuff."
5,Madras Curry,"Exceptional taste and packed to the top! It has just enough pepper in it for that good, hot kick normally associated with quality curries. I was using Cross and Blackwell but since they stopped their curry line the search was daunting but I've found one that is just as good, dare I say better!"
3,Nostalgic Account of Community,"Oldenburg's book is full of history around the changing landscape of cultural institutions, namely the ""3rd Place"": the places of rest, relaxation, and socialization at the heart of community. His focus is primarily on Western/Caucasian 3rd places, and at times is a little too nostalgic. I would have liked to see him address more around redefining these places, especially around the issues of the urban/inner-city places."
1,"Awful, silly book","Like his other book, this is among the silliest, most ridiculous books I've ever read, written by a sad, self-loathing gay man, and full of tortured logic and profound bigotry. I am a serious Christian and this book is an insult to Christians everywhere, painting Christianity as nasty, empty-headed, exlusionary biogtry. If this had been written in the 1950s, we could have excused its ignorance and foolishness, but today there is no excuse for it. As a Christian, it embarrasses me, and as a human being, it fills me with pity for its unhappy author."
4,In the tradition of academia,"This book is special in that it adds empirical support for the authors' business hypothesis. However, their ideas themselves are not revolutionary. Rather they organized and framed a lot of the ideas that today's business leaders already know and practice.I suppose that the book is in the tradition of academic research paper rather than overblown business hyperbole. As with any academic oriented publications, they make less than interesting reading, but valuable nevertheless."
3,"Seems average in taste, possibly not compatible with all hot air poppers","I purchased this popcorn along with a top rated hot air popper. I believe that because the kernels are smaller and lighter, if your hot air popper has a lot of power, be prepared to have the kernels fly all over until the point they start to pop. The popped kernels are definitely smaller than normal popcorn and frankly, I do not find the popcorn fluffier or less ""husky"". In fact, I am fighting the urge to pick my teeth as I write! All of this may be due to the fact that I am using a hot air popper. It is nice to know the corn is organic, but I am a little mad at myself for purchasing a 10 year supply! ;)"
4,Very Tasty,"I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again. We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning ""butter."" Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush."
1,It isn't hulless,There were more hulls in this popcorn than in any other that I've ever used. We found it to be very tough and after a couple of bites I ended up throwing it out. Amazon gave me a full refund. I would give them five stars for service.
1,no pop,The quality of your service was great but your popcorn was no good I tryed every way of popping it and it wouldn't pop.The kernals that did pop were little hard kernals that you couldn't eat.
1,Do NOT buy this popcorn!,"This popcorn totally refused to pop. No matter what way we tried to pop this popping corn, it was a total failure.I would not only NOT EVER recomend it to a friend, I would go out of my way to warn them to not to waste their money.It ended up in the garbage."
4,Squeak ender,This item did stop the floor squeaks in my house. I would have liked them to be more heavy duty. They are a bit light in construction but I suppose for the price I shouldn't complain. Bottom line they work.
3,Didn't work as well as I'd hoped,I had a popping groaning noise in my bathroom floor. After installing 2 of these spaced a few feet apart the noise is less noticeable but not gone. Same story on one of my bedroom floors.
1,oh mother...!! what is this that i subjected my ears to,"oh dear me, really lads, could you run me through just what you were thinking when you worte this ablum!?! this is SO bad, everyone was bangging on about how great this ablum was, so i thought, hay, i'll try it. WHAT A WASTE [money]! that would have been better spend on pick n mix! The whole thing is just so unoriginal, it's been done before guys, and to be honest, it's been done before a lot better than this! Just because you lads got a hit with all the trendies out here with 'how you remind me', which my the way, is so overplayed i can't stand to hear it any more, you think you can leave all your old fans and let them down with a ablum which you must have put together in your sleep!"
2,Get their old stuff.,"Nickelback's 4th cd (Hesher, Curb, The State, Silver Side Up--4, not 2. Just because their earlier cds weren't released in the US doesn't mean they don't exist) comes off as a rather mediocre rehash of their older material. No new ground is broken, and instead they move backwards. The song Just For is the best example. The original version (Just Four) which appeared on Curb is so much better that it is hard to describe. The emotion of the song is gone and it now comes off extremely flat. The single How You Remind Me [sounds like] Finger Eleven's Drag You Down. All in all, quite the disappointing cd. Not awful, but nowhere near as good as their old stuff. If you want Nickelback, pick up the State and try to get a copy of Curb. Silver Side Up isn't worth the money."
2,two really good tracks isnt an album,there are two tracks on this album i love but the rest to be honest to not spark the same creativity other than the last song there isnt anything that comes close how you remind me is a brilliant song and too bad is good as well but the rest are not on par when i got this album i was 11 and loved it and would of given in 5 stars on the dot but now im older (16) it just dosnt compare with bands like incubus system of a down and all the classics your probably better off buying the singles they do have better albums if dry grunge with course vocals that sound like sand paper are your thing then mayby the album would suit you but otherwise buy the singles
4,Nice,"What can I say? It's Nickelback. They rock. This is a four-star instead of five just because I like their others better, namely ""Here and Now"" and ""Dark Horse."""
3,A poor second attempt,"You might have bought this cd thinking, hey these guys aren't too bad, and you'd be right. Until you hear there first album. Silver Side Up seems to be the same riffs, the same chords, and the same mood rehashed throughout the whole album. Their first album The State was much more original, and much more unique. I was dissapointed by this release even though I am a big nickelback fan. But if you do like this one, be sure to check our The State."
5,"Same as The State, amazing!","Get this CD. I thought they would have a problem following up The State, but this is great!"
1,Gives lamest band ever award a run for its money.,"These guys suck. It sounds like Creed only worse. I think it's funny that the little wimpy 'cowardly lion-esque' singer from canada thinks he's tough in that video for never again where he's saying ""kicking your a$$ would be a pleasure"" I laughed so hard at that line I fell out of my recliner. I would have severe depression if I lost a fight to that nerdario. Another little tidbit that blows my mind is that they are on Roadrunner records, which, at one point in time was known for putting out brutal metal records, that certainly isn't the case anymore (with the exception of a few, like KSE for instance). Bottomline is, this is bad soft rock with a lame attitude. you should avoid this like black friday at wal-mart."
1,Nickelback...a total disgrace to Canada,"Don't buy this or any other CD by Nickelback. They are a horrible band with horrible songs, horrible 'music', and trite lyrics. You'd be better off dousing your head in acid then listening to this (Nickel)(...)."
2,Take a dump on their debut and put it in the C.D. player...,"... then you'll know what this sounds like. I mean, what the hell happened to the, they were already soft, but now??? Now it is a piece of modern rock bull[edit]. There songs are catchy, the lyrics (are bad), all it is is N'SYNC on acid sorta like [st]linkin park. This [edit] is really starting to (get bad)...-FM"
3,"Not as good as 1st album, worth buying","I found this album to be decent, however a glimmer compared to ""The State"" - 1st album. No doubt this will sell millions probably, as this band is headed in the right place, and deserve it. ""How you remind me"" reminds me of how much I wanted this album to rock, and it did a little."
4,Surprised,"I bought this CD today expecting the majority of the songs to be like ""How You Remind Me"", and for Nickelback to be a lot like Creed. However, after the first song, ""Never Again"", I knew I was mistaken. I ended up liking this CD much more than I thought I would. The lyrics are actually pretty angry, the guitars fast and the speed and energy about the same as Creed overall. If you're considering buying this album for songs like ""How You Remind Me,"" take my advice and don't. It's a much different album than I thought, and probably a lot of people thought.I can't say that I have a favorite song. Actually, I like them all. One of those albums you can listen to straight through. If you like hard rock/alternative, Metallica or Godsmack, this is for you."
2,the best cd of the decade,nickelbacks new cd silver side up is full of non stop hits like how you remind me never again and too bad it is without doudt the best cd ofthe decade.adefenate 5stars.
1,"ow, my brain hurts from thinking dude","wow.......how horrible.....hey, wait, we could use this for peaceful warfare....you know, just blast this at iraq or wherever dubyah wants to steal his oil from, and then all the residents will just blow their brains out, and we won't have any mass murder of innocent civilians to send the cia to cover up (oops, said too much)...make sure to send a picture of this guy's mug, that's some scary stuff, man........wait a sec, chico...maybe cobain heard this, like in a vision from the future, before he made wall art with his grey matter....makes yah think, don't it?"
1,rubbish,"no mater what anybody says,this album just isn't good.mediocre at best absolute dirge at worst,whichever way you look at it it still doesn't make for good listening.what nickleback and their kin are doing right now is pushing back american rock way back into the springsteen era.say what you want to say about nu-metal but its infinatly more fun this sorry bunch...."
2,not as good as it was made out to be,i thought this cd would rule from what evry1 was sayin about it but then i bought it and i relized it wasnt worth it. it has three good song and the rest just dont stand on their own. i wouldn't recomend this cd unless ur a hardcore nickelback fan.
2,It's Too Bad,"It's Too Bad, it's stupid...that this album couldn't live up to it's first two singles. I loved How You Remind Me and Too Bad so I decided to buy the cd. A band compared to Staind in lyrics, Nickelback didn't impress me with a few vulgar words. However, the melodies were catchy and I found myself humming Never Again, but not singing it. It deserves a little lower but the melodies is what I was impressed with. So a 2 star rating is a blessing for this cd."
2,A disappointment...,"After I heard Nickelback's hit song on the radio, I decided to take a chance and buy the CD. But I was very diappointed. Besides ""You Remind Me"", there was only one or two other songs I enjoyed on the album.It is really hard to pinpoint why or why not music is good to listen too, but for some reason the majority of the songs on this CD just annoyed me. I thought the lyrics were unoriginal and boring, as was the music itself.If you liked the style of ""You Remind Me"" or are considering getting this CD, you are much better off getting a CD from similar, but better groups, like Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, or The Calling, all of whose CDs I prefered to this one. So save your money and get something else!"
2,Disposable Rock,"Why on earth Nickelback are being credited for a grunge rival is beyond my apprehension. Their shows featuring pyrotechnics, and leather trousered rock posturing, brings to mind that famous Cobain phrase.There's no doubt they have the ability to craft catchy riffs and sing along melodies, but you get the feeling their trying too hard to be too many things to too many people. The radio freindly guitar licks appeal to the wannabe-grungers who find Alice In Chains and Nirvana too raw, and the attempted angsty lyrics appeal to the rebelious and disillusioned kiddies.In reality, the riffs are simple power chords, (getting tedious very quickly) and the lyrics are overly narrative and lacking in any real poetic mystery or meaning.In short Silver Side Up is rock by numbers.An excellent quote from a Radio DJ on Nickelback:""It's bizarre to mention Nickelback in the same sentance as Nirvana. Kurt would be ricocheting off his coffin lid."""
1,Radio rock.,"This album truly sucks. If I have to hear ""this is how you remind me"" one more time I will gouge my eardrums out. This is one of the nu-rock bands that shows whats wrong with music today."
1,how dull,"You've heard it before, I gurantee it. Granted, by a different band name, but don't be fooled, Nickelback is just as bad, if not worse than most bands on the radio at the current moment.Sure, the single is catchy... but it's not enough to warrant the purchase of the cd.Do yourself a favor, and save your 14 bucks. Treat yourself to something not so, corporate..."
1,Nirvana Rip Offs,"when i look at these guys all i can think of is Nirvana ""is that such a bad thing"" no it isnt............but the difference between Nirvana and Nikelback is Nikelback sucks major ass they are just mainstream rockers that want to be famous allt he time.......i hate bands like that i mean being on mainstream is cool but to sell out and hear your song on the radio 30 million times is hella annoying i mean damn enough is enough.look at it this way Tool is mainstream rock sorta not really but they dont outplay tool songs because Tool kicks ass thats why yeah thats right Nikelback you loser poser whining pieces of crap learn your lesson and back off that mic you cant sing worth crap and the guitars are just lame the drums are stupid everything about Nikelback sucks and for people who like this are retarded i mean it just sucks there might be like 4 seconds worth of something that is atcually good one one song and thats not saying much crappy band trsut me"
1,you want to listen to musical tales of domestic violence listen to korn,"People that say that this album is dark really doesn't know what they are talking about. I do not hate or feel contempt for any of the people that like this band or album. They obviously just aren't that exposed to much music. There was a time once when I thought Papa Roach was all that, then my friend gave me about 20 cd's full of Pantera, Korn, Mudvayne, A Perfect Circle, and Tool, and I realized how talentless and immature Papa Roach was. The people who like or listen to this album just need to do the same. Its all right guys, you can do it, spread your wings and leave this immature crap behind......Overall rating: 0/100DEFINITELY not recommended"
5,A stunning Second album from a great band,"There are few bands that just really impress you with a new and vibrant feel to the music.NickelBack stunned me with thier debut album ""the state"" and they keep this energy and feeling in this second albumI highly recomend that you get both of these great albums!"
5,I LOVE this book.,"If you know anyone who is having problems with love in their life, whether it be relationship love or love with themselves... buy them this book, and then buy them a copy of I Had It All the Time, by this same author. I wish I could give it higher than five stars (both books), because I hand these out to clients and friends I know, who are in need of finding themselves and who they are. These are probably, along with the Conversations with God series, by Neale Donald Walsch, the best books ever written. Extremely accessable and fun to read, I feel like I've know Mr. Cohen personally all of my life. Thanks again Alan for writing such a wonderful book."
4,a book about life and love,"This book takes the time to remind you of all the feelings you have when you have a crush on the girl you're afraid to talk to, when you're in love, when you're falling out of love, and when you detest love. I loved the way it made me think of the relationships that I've had and the ones I want. Michelle Tea writes with such a pleasant tone that you don't want to put down the book, because you start to feel like you're living the crazy San Francisco girls life. It may not be the book if you're looking for a lot of insight, but it's a pleasurable read."
1,simply doesn't work,"So far as I can tell, this product simply doesn't work at all. I purchased two of their large spray bottles because I take my dog for walks many times a day, and wasn't wanting to be exposed to deet all summer long. A ""natural"" product thus sounded great. Unfortunately, I can slather this stuff on immediately before going out, and the insects are still on me chewing me up the second I walk out the door. I'm not sure it doesn't actually ATTRACT them, since I certainly don't get bitten any more if I wear nothing at all, and it almost seems worse with the LN. Highly disappointed--guess there's no alternative to deet, and I'll probably go sterile or get cancer..."
2,"Missing all diagrams, but alright otherwise","I enjoy taxidermy as a semi-hobby, and was pretty excited when I saw this book offered up for free on Kindle. Unfortunately, whoever did the conversion to a Kindle document failed to include any of the pictures/diagrams and so it's useless unless you want to read about outdated taxidermy techniques."
1,Save your money,These pads squeal non stop. They fade just as bad as stock pads and they cover your wheels in dust after about 100 miles! Go with a premium set of pads from any parts store and you will be a lot better off and probably save a few bucks.
2,Very disappointed,"I was very happy when i first got this player, it looks good and was pretty easy to set up. Then i used it. it seems that the up sampling feature only works in the HDMI mode, and can NOT be enabled for component output(as per samsungs tech support). So if you are not planning on using HDMI, you might as well just buy any progressive sacn DVD play for $30. Again, the player will not output 720p on its component output even though the connection supports it."
4,Works Wonderfully,"Looks good, works great. I'm not sure if it's anything special but it functions fine. I think I probably could have gotten a cheaper player that works just as well."
2,Brush Your Body Beautiful,"This book doesn't get to the heart of the matter until chapter 7, where one recipe is given for mixing oils. I would have liked more recipes. Then the actual body brushing program comes toward the end, maybe 4 pages.Everything else was mostly filler. However, I did like the part about combining Avocado with salts for exfoliation. More of this type of info would have faired better with me. Finding out all the little things my mom has done for her skin with baking soda was of interest to me, so in that regard it spawned me to ask questions of family members about skin care.I am going to continue with the Body Brushing and see what happens to my skin. But I must admit I felt a little taken regarding the cost. Perhaps if a brush or 2 was part of the deal I would have felt better."
2,Good Information but not enough for a whole book,"I was attracted to this book because of the graphics and typography (I'm a graphic designer). But, after slogging through the first 125 pages in which the author rhapsodizes about the wonderful benefits of body brushing (without explaining how to do it), I was rather peeved when she finally got down to the simple instructions on pages 127-135 (which was stretching it). Nevertheless, I went ahead and tried body brushing and, indeed, it is wonderful. However, it wasn't worth the book price to get this information. Go ask someone at your local health food store for information -- spend your $14.95 on some nice avocado oil and and a brush."
3,Interesting,"Before reading this book, you may want to look into the controversy that surrounds it. When the book was first published there were numerous academic debates concerning it's content. It is something to look into."
4,Touching you Touching me CD,The CD I ordered came very well packed---item in good condition--came within a few days of ordering. I rateAmazon very high on quality of salesmanship...Alyce V
3,Good story...distracting typos,"Overall this book was entertaining although not on par with the creepy and creative delights I have come to expect from this author. I LOVE his short story collections and while this book has a solid and interesting story it was a bit disjointed and felt more like a draft than a polished novel.The biggest issue I have with this book is the insane number of typos (found on nearly every page), from extra punctuation to extra characters randomly sprinkled throughout. I don't know if I got some sort of alien adaptation, Kindle version, or if they are all like this but if you are easily distracted by misspelled words, strange punctuation and questionable grammar you may want to try a sample first before you buy.All in all I will read more of Brian Hodge's work and hope that there is more creepy goodness waiting for me in the next one!"
4,Ozzie & Harriet Christmas,"The video is still not too good, but the sound is much better than the previous version that was on VHS. Still a great wholesome video."
5,Beautiful,"I ordered two sets of Woodstock chimes, one was a gift, then I decided I needed a set too, so I got the Amazing Grace ones. Both I and the gift recipient are very happy. The chimes have a pure sound, seem very sturdy and look great. I haven't seen anything like them in quality for the price here in Australia."
4,Stanley food jar,It is very good looking and can keep warm more than 8 hours that very good for people want to have a hot food on the lunch.
1,Poor quality control,"After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to buy two Stanley Bolt food jar. The first one did not even hold the heat for more than 15 minutes and was returned. After two months the second food jar started to lose it's ability to retain heat. Very poor quality control from Stanley."
1,Only good for 2 months,"I bought this food jar in Oct 2010. 2 months later, the food jar did not keep food hot any more."
4,lunch thermos,It was a bit large for my nine year old. He likes it but I prefer the smaller one becuse it doesn't take up his whole lunch box. My husband borrows it often for soup.
4,This works great - unlike the Stanley Vacuum Bottle,I bought both the bottle and the food jar at the same time. The food jar keeps nice and soup hot but the bottle lets your hot coffee get cold.I kept the food jar but the bottle was sent back.How can they be so different when they look so similar?
4,A wonderful food jar,"This food jar replaced my 30 year old thermos, which had been lined in plastic over the glass. I really like this one for the metal touching the food. Perhaps 30 years ago we didn't know hot foods should not contact plastic, but now we do. I would give this a five, except the handle arrived loose. Not loose enough to send back, just loose enough to be a little irritating."
1,Has Disney Gone To Far?,Most kids watch Disney and I don't know if its just me or does most of the people on disney turn into singers also? Most of the singers I have liked like Aly & AJ and Raven for examples but Chrisy's music wasn't for me. The style of her music is pop like most of the other Disney stars. I like pop so I thought I'd like Christys music I heard the Teachers Pet song it wasn't bad then about five months later they aired Dive In I found myself turning off the TV I thought it was horrible. It aired so much I really couldn't stand it. Christy is a good actress and she should stay with acting but singing isn't for her. I reccomed you buy Into The Rush. Aly & AJ's album.
5,The most intriguing book I've ever read,"If you are sickly curious, this is a fabulous book. One of the best I've ever read, it is a very thourough documentation on ""snuff"" films (the murder of someone on camera for the purpose of selling for entertainment). It's chapters completely cover the subject of snuff in ficticious films, mondo, or ""shockumentaries,"" and the actual myth of snuff. So good, it prompted me to write a research paper on it. If you can find a copy of this book, by all means read it, especially if you are fascinated by taboo films, don't have access to these films, or simply don't have the stomach for them."
5,josie and the pussy cats,great cd just as great as the movie!!!!!!All the songs on the cd are filled with punk rock that just makes you wanna dance and it makes you so happy. It' is one of the best CD's that own. I listen to it all the time. It's so fun and a great a cd. i would definetly recommend buying it to anyone. And you should also go see the movie cause it was great too.
5,This CD is TOTALLY SWEET and has a punky feel! GO GIRLS!,"I have never heard such a girl-powered soundtrack and typically I dont like soundtracks but these songs are really catchy! My fav songs are Pretend to be nice, real wild child, spin, and 3 small words. I just saw the movies yesterday and I immediately thought, Wow, this has some really kewl muzic on it. I thought it was really funny how they included the DuJour tour---that was HILLARIOUS!!! The real voices on this track remind me of a girl version of blink-182. ACtually all of da songs kinda have a mixture of things. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD!!! this is a ver ygood cd with some fuhnky sayings, but yet wise words!!"
5,Objective and information packed resource,"This was the first book of it's kind that I've read that didn't ""take sides"" on this controversial issue. Everything else I've read either focused entirely on the biochemical aspects of psychiatric disorders, and recommended the use of medication, or took the opposite stance that medication for such things is bad, and puts our children at a disadvantage so that life will be easier for parents and teachers. This book clearly describes various mental disorders- it presents criteria for diagnosis including symptoms checklists and detailed examples. It shows which conditions are likely to require medical intervention to improve, and which could benefit from alternatives. The descriptions of how a child with each disorder behaves are extremely helpful. If your child has one of the diorders covered in this book, you will recognize it easily when you read it's description.. Am informative book in a clear, inderstandable style."
2,Remastered???,"""Sloppy production"" is an understatement. I don't know what JSP does to ""remaster"" recordings, but these have all the audio fidelity of a 1950s AM radio broadcast. Muffled bass, scratchy highs, uneven volumes--it's really too bad, because there's some good music here, although there is little diversity in musical styles among these selections. Also, arranging these in an uneven reverse chronological order grab-bag makes no sense at all. You want bluegrass history as it should be? Check out ""Can't You Hear Me Callin'--Bluegrass--80 Years of American Music ""."
4,Looks good... just like the original...,"When Atari/Infogrames created Backyard Sports a few years ago, I thought of it as just a JOKE. But when I played the game on the computer, it was very fun. Something like a kid version of NBA Live 2004. If you're looking for a basketball computer game for you kids, this is it.The original version will probably be just like the 2004 version, but new features will include- Better and newer prefessional players- Some new made up players- Hopefully, better graphics- The option to draft playersI've played NBA Live 2003 [] and I loved it so much, I decided to play it the whole night. So if you're looking for something just like a NBA Live 2003, without the hype, Backyard Basketball 2004 will probably look good."
3,OK Chime,Was disapointed in this chime being it was from a notable company. The tones are too close together and the stricker is positioned too close to the chimes.
3,My wind chimes - Woodstock Encore Collection Bronze Chimes,I bought windchimes before from this company but these chimes hardly make any noise. They aren't that great.I hung them where it is windy but I seldom hear them.
5,It fits and it works,"This diffuser fits well and does what's expected.It's a good alternative when the ceiling is toohigh to bounce the flash.A general recommendation for flash output adjustmentwould be useful. I used +1 EV, which seems to be aboutright."
3,Disappointed,"I was excited to use these with my flashes to help diffuse the light. However, they did not fit on my flashes. I ended up returning them."
4,Great value,"First off if bouncing the flash is an option just do that instead of using this.However, if bouncing isn't an option (ceilings too high or outdoors) this does a good job of softening the flash. I read some other reviews that suggested ""mcguyvering"" your own diffuser but why would you have an expesive DSLR camera with a nice flash and then use some ghetto rig up of a diffuser instead of putting up a little bit of money to use a proper one.If you can't afford to buy a diffuser for under $20 then how did you afford to buy a Nikon DSLR?"
4,works fine,"perfect for direct flash shooting, for bounce doesnt help so much, fits perfect and its weigh does not affect your shoot"
1,Don't Bother...,Save your $15; just tilt the flashhead up for better pictures.I have uploaded an image showing how the flash lights a fruit plate compared with1) flash bouncing/tilt (no diffuser)2) with the diffuser and3) with the flash straight ahead (no diffuser).See and judge for yourself.Cons:-The built in tilt/bounce flash on the SB-400 works infinitely better than this diffuser.-There is a slight color cast in the photos from the plastic.-You can lose it.Pros:+The diffuser SLIGHTLY reduces highlights from the direct flash (but the images look largely the same with and without it).Bottom Line: Save your money.
4,Easy to Install,"Took me about 45 mins to install and adjust following the excellent instructions which were included with the product.It's been on less than a week, no rain / snow yet - waiting to see if it keeps bed as dry as my last cover did."
1,Worst Cover Ever,"for a band like Deep Purple. I have not had the pleasure to listen to the record but with a cover like that it can't be any good. I mean, what the hell, not even Frank Zappa or Woody Allen would come with such a horrible cover. If Deep Purple would have the sane idea to change it i may buy it, otherwise i would have to make my own cover for it."
4,ripe banana,"P>This new disk may be a bit short on originality (it sounds to me like an extension of Perpendicular), but the chops are still there and so are the hooks. The creative juices are still flowing to some acceptable degree in Purple Land and a we can be thankful for that much.While Bananas does not quite measure up to the band's 70's output it still packs a solid punch and should stand the test of time. They manage to keep things rather fresh and contemporary while maintaining the classic Purple sound. Just don't expect ""Who Do You Think We Are?""Individual performances by band members are well above average and Ian Gillan continues to belt 'em out like he always has. Don Airey does surprisingly well on keyboards. For a band that has several members pushing 60, you have to give them credit for having the [courage] to get up there and do what they do. And do it remarkably well.Overall enjoyable, rock solid and a pure Purple delight. Can't go wrong."
3,"Great exercises, not as great on the execution part","I think the vocal and breathing exercises on here are great.Some of the exercises speed up unnecessarily, almost as if she is showing off. On some of the exercises this gets so out of hand that she can't keep up on the piano with the tempo she set.That being said, a lot of the exercises have a varying tempo.Not a bad product. Not great either, just, so-so."
4,Good,The only word I can think of for this CD is good. It isn't outstanding or anything like that. You definitely get what you pay for.
1,This bundle is a ripoff.,"You can get the 3 games at 49.99. The rest of the package is just a nintendo wii, which you can get for 250 retail.400 is the actual retail price for this (assuming you buy all the games new, and get the wii at regular retail price.)DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY BUNDLE IT IS A RIPOFF>"
3,oh youth where art thou ?,"as a fan of the show since first watching it in 1973 I can say this book should be called ""the incomplete book of Gerry Anderson's UFO"" because it boggle's the mind that the incredible picture's in this publication is in black and white when the show is in color! I would have paid an extra couple of dollar's for that privlage come on guys get a clue!"
3,its okay,The reason i say its okay is because i wish it was an actual lotion type to blend in because it doesnt blend in like lotion but it works on a pimple tho... Id rather return to using murad. I give it three stars because i wish it was more lotion type.
1,not worth owning,"This charger is a piece of crap. It takes a week to get batteries to a partial charge, and has no charge controller built in so there is a constant charge / discharge going on. I left a set of brand new high capacity nimh batteries in it for 3 weeks thinking they would finally be charged and they where garbage. they would not even charge up to 25% capacity in a plug in charger afterwords."
1,Unbearable stupidity,"Just what we need: another bullying fundamentalist Christian telling us how to live our lives. Except this time it's extra-stupid, extra-vapid comments filled with cruelty and the intolerance we've come to expect from the racist, right-wing religious freaks from the South."
4,Nicely designed webcam,"This is a very nicely designed webcam that will clip easily onto newer laptop screens that are relatively thin. The clip is not very flexible. So thicker screens may be a problem but it works fine for my laptops. The picture is great and the installation is a no brainer.The first unit I received was defective and had to be returned, leading me to wonder about manufacturing quality, but the second one I received worked flawlessly and has not shown any quality problems.The mouse is a pleasant bonus that works quite well."
1,Does not lighten!,This product did not work. I purchased this product in the hopes of lightening my underarm area prior to wedding day. I purchased it 3 weeks before hand and used it twice a day. There was no diffrence in my underarm area. I was very disappointed with this procuct. The only reason I gave it one star was for the smell. It was very pleasant smelling.
1,the worst ever! a rip off!,this product doesnt work.in fact i think it is some type of home made product. it smells like elmer's glue and it kind of feels like it too. i tried it and nothing. huge huge diappointment and a waste of time!.....and definitely a waste of money!
2,A Little Disappointed!,"Heidemann often shows a true passion, almost an obsession, when photographing his models. He usually brings out the sensual and passionate moods of all his good-looking models. I was a little disappointed with this collection of color male-nude images of the ""Boyz of Miami"". First of all, there's not a boy in sight, most are mature men. Second, there seem to be a lack of emotion or passion in these shots. I am surprised, as he usually captures more feelings and sensuality when photographing his male models. I think it may be the angles, the choppy images, the heads cropped out, the extreme close-ups, and the bland shots of the models not knowing how to pose that leaves a lot to be desired in this collection. Heidemann has great talent, but whoever selected these images, should have left them by the wayside. Hopefully, the next collection of his images will be better.Joe Hanssen"
5,ADA Expert's Opinion of Access-Board's ADAAG,"Finally a well written and understandable printed version of ADAAG with pictures and graphics that match the ADA Law! This is without a doubt a must have book for anyone attempting to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). I'll be using this book daily in my work as an ADA Consultant, so I'm glad that it's finally worthy...."
1,Denon DVD -757 is a piece of junk,This player is a piece of crap. I have struggled with it for more than a year. Whenever it gets to a DVD it has trouble with it just freezes and none of the buttons including power will work. You have to unplug the thing from the wall to even get the disk out. Don`t expect any help from Denon either. DON`T BUY THIS PLAYER!!!
3,Interesting story -- irritating hero.,"This book has everything: action, spacecraft, nazis, espionage... hell, even ping pong. :)If you like stories with any of the above elements, this one is probably worth taking along on an airplane ride.For me, the worst part of the book was the hero. I found Tom Kelly's machismo obnoxious. He is one of those people who seriously needs his bottom side kicked, but sadly, noone can..."
1,Neutrogena sunscreen,No problem with the seller BUT I would never buy this product again. My face broke out within 2 days. Went to my local drug store and bought a product for 1/2 the price and works much better and no break outs...
5,Great Sunscreen,we ride motorcycles and we are always in the sun. this really saves our skin. I highlt recommend this product
1,hello,"This is one of the worst sun block formulations I have tried. Why?1. This product is very greasy and makes my skin appear oily all day long. In fact, someone recently asked me if I was a little warm in our air-conditioned office since they noticed how ""shiny"" my skin appeared and assumed the oil on my skin was sweat.2. When applying this product, I look like a ghost. The product is very visible and it makes my skin appear unnaturally white.3. The product flakes off. When I apply it, the product leaves white flakes on my skin and these flakes are hard to remove from my skin and impossible to remove from my eyebrows or any hair, should I accidently get too close. In other words, the sunblock doesn't get absorbed fully into the skin.4. Applying this sunblock sometimes makes my skin turn red and stay red for a few hours.I used this product for a couple of days then threw it out, so I can't say whether or not it works. I'm currently trying other products (not neutrogena!)"
3,White residue surfaces,"This product certainly blocks the sun, but when used before any physical activity, it results in a noticable white residue on the skin though the cream had been completely rubbed in. It makes it hard to use on your face (which is what I purchased it for)."
3,Effective but greasy,"I use this sunscreen on my face, neck and hands. The first time I used it on my hand, it left a white streak after few minutes of sweating. So I figured that maybe I applied too much of it and started applying it in small quantities and haven't had problems with it since. For my face, I found it to be chalky and greasy and I have to blot out the oiliness out before I apply makeup. It is an effective sunscreen but as any other normal sunscreen, it does burn a bit when applied to areas near the eye."
1,Bad reaction to the product,"I don't have extremely sensitive skin -- most of the time it's fine with whatever I put on it. However, I AM extremely pale and freckled, so I make a habit of wearing sunscreen most days. This one caused my skin to dry out and feel chapped -- I stopped using it several days ago and my skin is still flaky and sensitive."
3,I'd absolutely love it if it weren't so dang THICK!,It's a good block. With an SPF of 100 it has to be good. However it's so thick. The only time I'm willing to use it is when I'm going to the beach or at the pool. I'm medium brown tone AA and it show's up with steaks of gray so I can't wear it under make up or on my arms with out it looking funny. I probably shouldn't be using it at the pool since it doesn't specify for water use but I rarely get my face wet so I like to use it anyway. I say it works well but who want's to walk around with thick gray streaks?????? I guess it's better than sun damage. Hopefully they can develope a better formula. In the meantime I'm searching for something shear.
5,Great sunscreen,I love this sunscreen. It absorbs fast and my makeup goes on smoothly. It doesn't cake and roll off like some other sunscreens.
5,I won't step out of the house without it,"The price was perfect and it sold me on this product. From the very first use, I knew I wouldn't want anything else. It isn't greasy or thick. It soaks perfectly into your skin and guess what? No nasty smell that a lot of other sunscreen lotions have."
1,Terrible!,"Not only is this product the opposite of sheer (it was incredibly hard to rub in all the white residue), but it gave my wife a horrible rash all over her face. After doing a google search about it, we found that she's not the only person to have this reaction. It seems to be somewhat common."
4,Wish this product was unscented,"Bought this at a local drugstore and did not realize the product had a slight scent. For people who are sensitive to perfumes, or have allergies, this could be a problem as some perfumes cause problems.Overall, I do like how easy this product to apply to the skin, and I do like the SPF factor.I'd recommend using this suntan lotion, if you do not have problems with scented products."
5,An inspiring book to help you improve yourself immediately.,"I define a good book as one that has the ability to change your life immediately. This book does that. It's hard to argue with what the authour is saying. He has the knack of explaining difficult issues in a simple way. It's the sort of book you want to share with others. If you're into improving yourself to the furtherest extent, you need this book."
1,Bogus Mantovani,This is NOT a genuine Mantovani and His Orchestra recording. It is of substantially lower quality and the use of the Mantovani name is (in my opinion) fraudulent. Check with the Mantovani Fan Website for a listing of genuine Mantovani and His Orchestra CD releases.
4,Very helpful,I think this voice lesson training is easy and helpful. I play it in the car to practice before class or a performance and people look at me strangely and I just smile and continue with my DO RE MIs. It really opens my throat and makes me focus on my breathing.
1,This book wasn't very good at all.,"All of the stories deal with this depressing individual who writes nonsense about everything. I had to read this for school and then discuss it and it was horrible. His ridiculous ideas and life story was boring. IF all these stories are true, this guy 1. needed to find new friends. 2. He needed to get a life. Apologizing to your blood when you cut yourself is ...."
2,Just Okay,Not bad. Have seen better and have seen worse. Not much to recommend it in terms of being distinctive. One more word: Amen
3,Mixed bag,"To my taste, Bing swqings, but he was not good when doing ballads and I wonder why they did not tone down the audience noise as the sound of clapping on the audio track is not pleasant they could have toned it out"
2,Did not stick,Bought the product after reading all the reviews. It did not stick on the wall for some reason and I did not find it as useful as advertised. Planning to return.
5,One of the Best Shower Caddies!,Length:: 0:51 MinsI needed more space in my shower but I didn't like the ones that hang in front. Chrome types usually leave nasty rust marks so I decided to go with this one after the great reviews. I haven't needed to change the strips yet.
5,"Finally, a caddy that provides great security!","I have had several shower caddies over the past years and this is the first one that I think really is going to hold up to daily use. Although I would not normally select plastic over metal, our seaside environment makes metal much more likely to rust than the average shower. Despite the plastic, I think that it is actually pretty good looking and provides a good amount of storage without being too large.Overall, another great amazon purchase!Also- using the standard free shipping (with other purchases), it arrived in only ~5 days in Hawaii. Gotta love the free shipping!"
2,Unnecessary Soap Dish in Center!,I wish I had read through the reviews before purchasing. This caddy has a soap dish in the center. We do not use bar soap so this is useless. I thought it would just be a larger version of the smaller caddy. Our in-laws use bar soap so this will go in the guest bathroom but I'll be ordering the smaller basket for our bathroom. I would not purchase again unless I used bar soap and needed a place to put it.
1,Most useless item,"These are the most useless waste of $15. I ordered them because I'm not a fan of those corner things and living in the UK I have an abnormal shower set up so those over the shower head ones don't work. I got two of these and put one in the shower completely following the directions on the package. I put it up in the morning, and the next morning it was on the ground dropping shampoo bottles on my feet. I didn't even put in the full sized bottles, just my little things as I didn't want to overload it. I'd return it if I could and warn you to spend your hard earned cash on a product that will stay where you need it to stay."
2,"Didnt work for me,followed instructions to the T","Quality plastic and looks to be very durable,but 48 hours and it was in the floor. But exterior double tape wouldnt hold it either. It may just be the tile in my shower. After several times of trying, I gave up and went back to a hang over the showerhead organizer."
4,great selection of poems,"Charles Martin's selected poems come from thirty years of writing poetry, and the skill he has is evident. Martin has a formal control over his poetry that isn't seen much today, and his use of language is exquisit. The selection contains translations, poems on pop culture, poems that touch on the deeper levels of being human, and selections from his long narrative 'Passages from Friday' (the Robinson Crusoe story told from Friday's perspective). These poems are not only a wonderful selection of poems, but great examples of technical skill."
4,What I expected!,"Not too many Obe Wan Kenobe costumes out there. Found this one on may different sites and was cheapest on Amazon through 7th Avenue Store. One size fits most makes me nervous. I'm 5'7, 170 lbs and most ""one size"" items are too big. This was not the case. Jedi clothing isn't meant to be fitted. This fits great and still has room for someone bigger. Material is as expected. A little cheap so be careful not to rip it. Only real complaint is the belt. Looks good, but a little weak. When I place my light saber on it, it weighs it down and I'm afraid it's going to rip. Will have to put string or another belt with it to hold light saber. Overall I'm satisfied with this product. Great Jedi look without breaking wallet."
5,We need more 5.1 albums like this!,"This was a another great album from BT, but what truly set it apart was the amazing 5.1 DTS mix. I wish that artists spanning all genres would take note of how much more you can convey to to the listener when the music is mixed in 5.1.This Binary Universe had great sonics, excellent 5.1 presentation, and great replay value.My only gripe is that this isn't a 5.1 96/24 MLP DVD-A. It also could have even been nice to at least get a DTS 96/24 track, but why compress to DTS when MLP is available. This only would have been really beneficial though if BT had mixed the tracks originally at a higher level than 48/24. I have a feeling that this is supposed to be a sort of demo disc for DTS entertainment though which is why it is DTS only in surround.If you like BT or just like cool surround music, this is a must buy!"
2,NOT THE BT I KNOW. MOVIE SCORE NO BEATS,"I am a huge BT fan. I have seen BT live, have all the CD's and visit his blog often. I am just as, if not more disapointed with this as when I bought the Monster Soundtrack. I feel that this album was not marketed for what it was and BT's ""teasers"" were sort-of farce. When it comes down to it, dont expect any breakdowns, build-up, stutter-beats, vocals or anything like that. Listen to the clips before buying. I bought this on itunes and here on amazon. Im disapointed..."
1,"Product contains a known carcinogen,","I have never written a review before. However, I am surprised that no one indicated that this product is labeled as containing ""thiourea.....a chemical known to.....cause cancer."" No matter how shiny my silver might be, I would not use a known carcinogen and would never have ordered it had it been revealed prior to my order. Very few products are labeled as containing a carcinogen and I find it significant that this is so labeled. I am writing this review for others who might find it concerning that the product contains a known carcinogen."
5,Best ever!,"I have used this product for years and it is getting almost impossible to find in the stores so I thought I would check Amazon and of course, they had it. All you have to do is place your flatware in the basket inside the container, take it out, rinse it off and the silverware looks brand new. For larger pieces, you can pour a little bit of the liquid on a clean cloth and wipe the piece off, rinse and you're good to go!!!"
3,title is self-explanatory,The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in good condition as the seller reported.
5,very informative,This book was very informative. It describes four profiles of borderline mothers and how their behaviors can impact their children. It provides suggestions for how children can deal with their mothers and try to have the best possible relationship and stay healthy.
3,Not for beginners,"I think this may be a fine book for more advanced artists. There was little help for true beginners,even""serious "" ones. There was much philosophy and opionion, but little practical help."
3,A valid example of Italian singed electronic album,Various music styles has influenced this italian growing group to make this album. A journey from trip-hop to drum'n'bass/house italian singed. This crew has class to sell on the big beat scene... Don't waste time....buy it!
3,It's different!!,"This video box set was entertaining. I am a radio station copywriter (a person who writes commericals), so I am interested in commericals of all kinds. But the average person will get a kick out of the coffee commercial with a very early version of Kermit the Frog in it, the 1970's PSA with Iron Eyes Cody, and the Hi-C commercial with the Monkees in it. Who could ever forget ""Quisp"" and ""Screaming Yellow Zonkers""? This is a fairly good collection of commercials, and most people will find this box set interesting and mildly funny."
5,I like this revised edition,"I bought the hardcover edition -- it was my favorite fashion book. But now, the revised edition with the introduction that involves new stars and their photos (Gwyneth Paltrow, Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore and Cher) adds a new dimension to the story. I'm really happy and for a paper back, the quality is EXCELLENT. Thanks Patty Fox!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I don’t like to leave negative reviews, but after thinking that I had “beat the system” by purchasing cheaper ink online, I was sadly mistaken. I ended up spending more $ and had to go out and buy the stuff full priced from the store. A printer guy told me that a lot of the recycled or cheaper cartridges that you can get can end up screwing up your printer up. My printer luckily didn’t get messed up permanently, but the papers it printed had gobs of ink coming out (and yes, I did all the troubleshooting that was possible). Save your money and buy the stuff from a local store. I know it sucks to pay full price, but it sucks even more to pay for something that could ruin your printer."
4,Unintended double order,Was told my order didn't go through so l placed the order again and ended up buyingAnd getting two---not my intent.
5,"If I ever said ""Must have"" I would say it here","I never say ""must have"" because India is as varied as the number of people who visit, but, this book comes close.It certainly should be on your reading list before the usual Frommers or Lonely Planet style travel guide.When you go, behave yourself and be a good and respectful and polite and patient guest ... that is what will work the best.Also check out our DVDs on India Topics on AmazonVisually and Respectfully Yours, the story of The Tibetan Photo ProjectVoices in ExileSave Tibet...Why?India 101 hosted by Sazzy Varga"
4,Interesting read,"Cold Quarry is the third installment of Andy Straka's series about private investigator Frank Pavlicek. Frank becomes suspicious of the death of a friend who was a fellow falconry enthusiast. Frank and his former NYPD partner Jake Toronto suspect foul play even though the local police consider it a hunting accident. More bodies pile up, and Frank and Jake continue their investigation at great personal risk.Cold Quarry has sympathetic characters, a plausible story line, and plenty of action.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for a review."
3,Good but a bit sterotyped,"Frank is a hard boiled PI, with the usual complicated love life and side kick, Toronto(why did i keep thinking Tonto). His progress through this thriller is fairly predictable and I am constantly reminded of Parker's Spencer.However, it is an intricate and intriguing plot, with lots of tension and excitement. One feels one knows the victim Chester thanks to the character sketches provided by his friends and family. The effect of his death on his son, Jason, is sensitively dealt with.Frank's daughter Nicole is a breath of fresh air and the interwoven plot of falconery is interesting and obviously well researched.I received a review copy of this book and found it hard going in the first chapter, but I perservered and enjoyed it."
4,Cold Quarry warmed up to be a great book!,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.I'm not a huge fan of murder mystery/investigative books. But I do enjoy the occasional who done it... With that said, I really enjoyed this book. It was a nice light read, it didn't bog you down with too many extra details as some writers are apt to do. Rather than fill his book with fluff, Andy Straka fleshed it out with characters who have personality, empathy and charm. The gruff hero, Frank Pavlicek made me want to keep picking up the book so I could try and figure out who the murderer was. I was kept guessing right to the end.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes P.I. novels or murder mysteries.Happy Reading =}"
5,Fantastic,"Not only are these excellent condoms (a little bigger, but nice and snug), but they're at a fantastic price! Thanks, CondomMan!"
5,"satisfied, in all senses of the word :)","good size, could be lubricated a bit more. expiration date was 2015. sensitivity was as good as any other durex product."
5,Inspirational,This book gives lots of insight on three very important concepts that I needed for a closer walk with God.
5,ANOINTED!!!,"Reading through this book was so amazing, and powerful. The changes the Lord brought into my life through this revelation has me soaking in His presence constantly. This is a here and now word. Do not pass it up. So, Click the Add To Shopping Cart button already will ya!"
1,Awful,"Why in God's name would you rewrite people who already died in the original series? Just because someone made a popular game doesn't mean you should sell out even more. I have read everything the man has published up until now, including Fairie Tale. Disappointment doesn't even come close."
4,Feist Plays Hookey in his own World,"I gave this fluff a four - which it really doesn't deserve but...Jimmy and Arutha are my favorite characters in the Midkemia world...and Assassins is head and shoulders above Betrayal. And even though we are clearly set up for books 3, 4 etc., I'd rather have mediocre Feist than no Feist at all. Feist makes Assassins a stronger book by concentrating it's limited plot line on Squire James and his Prince. Betrayal had a 'Whoo! Where did that come from.' quality that...well...betrayed the reader. Assassins is much more tightly plotted. I can see how this novel is structured after a video game: fighting in the Nighthawks underground fortress is clearly level x...but it doesn't wack you in the head with it. And, for the most part, I didn't feel I was reading something written for computer geeks who want a further game fix. So I guess I'll be waiting for book 3... Krondor, the Misdemeanor?"
3,OK I read most of this book and,"Well if you have something really going for you, this is a good book. If you have had a hard life like mine with few resources this book will depress you. However I don't think you have fallen to my depths, thus the three stars. The only degree needed to write this book is a degree of common sense, and if you have that, ha you don't need this book, because you already know, it is not what you know, it is who you know. On the other hand if you have been in college most of your life, you really need to read this book."
5,Extremely useful volume for professionals,"I can see why this book got such rave reviews and is such a best-seller. It's a superb book, offering both real insight into trauma and addiction, as well as hands-on clinical tools. As someone in the field, I have found both the philosophical and practical aspects of Najavits' work incomparable. On top of the impeccable professionalism, is her impressive writing. This is a must buy for anyone interested in this area."
3,This book is different. The Compassion exercises were helpful.,"recommended - The Anxiety and phobia workbook now in 5th edition,what to say when you are talking to yourself - ""YOU "" positive statement, the PTSD sourcebook, a top book on your coping tools- sex addict - alcohol, sugar, video games, other soft drugs, etc. The forgiveness exercise on my blog ihackreality."
5,Haunting and timeless,"Someone gave me a copy of this in 1994 and it's one of my most cherished CDs. I listen to it only occasionally, when I am seeking solace and the quiet beauty of these masterful performances. The liner notes suggest that the recording was made around 1968, though it was freshly mastered for this release, and I just can't believe that the music was recorded at that or *any* date.Stylistically, the music falls somewhere between classical, folk, and new age. All pieces are the product of Nicholson playing some stringed instrument (guitar? dulcimer?), and the combination of cascading melodies and intricate textures never fails to both engage and soothe me."
4,Very pleasing,"This is one of my two year old's favorite board books. The colors are wonderfully bright, and the pronunciation hints help me read the Spanish to her correctly."
5,Board Book,"This book is just what I was looking for-for my 20 month old. With regular books that have paper pages, the pages tend to get ripped when he uses the book. With this one he can turn the pages, it's a short simple book for him to learn to read and for us to read to him. It has the sentences in both English & Spanish."
2,NOT for parents,"I read a different book every month on some issue related to parenting, and this was one of the least helpful or relevant. Much of it was pedantic, some of it was common sense, and a lot of it was just plain not rooted in, or applicable to, reality but was instead too laboratory based. I would not be at all surprised if the author has no children of his own. However, I do appreciate the overall concept of what he is discussing and the book does provide some food for thought."
4,A walk down memory lane,"While I was reading this book, I felt like I was answering a lot of old questions from my past. Dr. Pollack did a wonderful job in his interviews and his examples of boys dealing with their problems. I felt like there were times when I was depressed but yet did not know it. Using Dr. Pollack's revised diagnosis measures for depression, there were in fact many times that I was depressed as a teenager. I am going to recommend this book to both men and women to show that the ""boy code"" can be changed if we as a society will look at boys with a different light."
1,"TOO MODERN, TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT...","My take on this book is as simple as can be - TOO EFFEMINATE! It should be common knowledge now that trying to turn boys into girls does not work. Whether he wishes to face it or not, boys and girls are different. While Pollack does make some points, he neglects the fact that toughness, agression, hiding feelings (to a point), etc, are hard-wired into a boy. To try to turn boys against their very nature is not the way to go. 'Tis true that some boys' behavior has gotten out of control, but this is not the way to go about effecting change."
1,wow....useless drivel...wow.,"As basis for my critique, I choose to do that which the author has refused: accurately quote primary sources.""Listen to PETER:""Being a guy, wow. You don't know when you are going to offend someone-you always have to be watching yourself."" pg. 151""Sixteen-year-old ROSS relates it this way: ""Being a guy today, wow. You don't know when you're going to offend someone. You've always got to be watching yourself."" pg. 163wow, I would have thought the proof readers would have caught that one. wow, its not even good fiction. wow, i cant believe this guy is APA backed. wow"
5,Beautiful!,"I ordered these for my daughter's graduation. They arrived way ahead of time and are absolutely lovely, the color is not as stark a white as pictured; rather they are a very creamy ivory color. Perfect!"
4,Great read...,All for a baseball card? Amazing. Well written and highly entertaining read that keeps you coming back for more...entertaining and satisfying...
3,Good book,"Nothing is earth shattering news but it helps you put it in perspective. It helped me light'n up and decide what is important n what is not. Less stress in the house as a result ,"
5,Great perspective for getting through those teen years,"We went to a seminar by the author of this book when our oldest son was 16. It helped tremendously and the book follows the points of the seminar closely. We have since purchased several copies of the book for other parents going through those rough teen years. We find the advice still as applicable today as it was for us ten years ago when we first discovered it.The author's basic premise is that you need to recognize what behaviors are truly dangerous (such as drug and/or alcohol use) and what behaviors are ""MBA's"" - mild but annoying. ""Mild"" may be too mild of a term, but the premise is sound. While an ""F"" on a report card can seem devastating, it really isn't (something we can attest to, a few years removed from several of them on our son's report card). This book offers a perspective that can help any parent realize which fights are worth fighting, and which ones you should let go."
4,When to intervene and when to let go,"Dr. Phelan gives concise, clear ideas about how parents should interact with their adolescents. Parenting books often fall into the trap of a ""one size fits all"" approach to parenting. Dr. Phelan acknowledges that adolescents often have different temperaments and may require varying types of parenting approaches.Communication between parent and adolescent is a tricky thing. It is easy to stymie the flow of information. He lists several ""dos"" and ""don't"" that may help keep the lines of comunication open. He illustrates each of these points with real-life vignettes. He discusses general guidelines for when it is better for the parent to intervene; when to just let go; and when to seek professional consultation.I am glad that this title is available in audiocassette form. Parents today are often busy with work, home duties and carpooling. A casette, or anything that is practical and saves time, is great."

5,GREAT VALUE!,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT VALUE AND WAS DELIVERED AS PROMISED. THE FRAGRANCE IS MY BROTHERS FAVORITE. SO THIS IS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM SANTA.
2,Don't get much for your $,Ordered this as a gift and was surprised at how small it was.Turned into a stocking stuffer because of the small size - you don't get very much for your money.
3,Not Worth The Money,"It has some good words and it is presented in a readable fashion. But it fails to elevate anyones vocabulary beyond, say a high school senior or college freshman might be required to learn or carry a dictionary around to utilize in their papers."
2,BORROW IT !,"This book is as far from ""easy reading"" as it gets!(I suggest a look at the sample pages) As a Personal Trainer, I was bombarded with details, rather than simply the results, of complicated studies and research. This book could have been summarized in 50 pages for the general public. The information is excellent but too scientific. Borrow it if you really need scientific specifics."
1,VERY VERY LARGE GLOVES,VERY VERY LARGE GLOVES.When I received the gloves are surprised even giant size. Recommend anyone NOT THIS PRODUCT IS VERY ANNOYING.THE SIZE IS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN AN AVERAGE HAND. PURCHASE HORRIBLE. STARS IF I COULD GIVE WOULD 0.I lost my money. WHEN WERE RECEIVED BY THE TRASHNot what I expected
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this game with great anticipation. I have been playing Might & Magic since III. I love this game.For those gamers who also love this game, beware. The user-interface has been changed completely. It is no longer simple and easy to manage. In fact, I found it to be so frustrating that I ended up giving my first copy of this game away. I have, since, bought another copy. I shouldn't have wasted the money."
1,All i can say is my collection is complete.,"Was rather disappointed in this one. I had heard it wasn't as good but I loved this series and I tend to like stuff others don't, so I thought I'd still give it a go. The interface is slow and unresponsive. I know some people think there should be changes and inovation each time a new game comes out... personally they should have stuck to the old interface and just spent more time on the story of the game... I didn't get very far into it as it was just so clunky and easy to get disoriented...."
4,Great lens!,"I am absolutely in love with this lens! I own a Canon Rebel T3, and it fits perfectly. At first, I was unsure on how to attach the lens, but the lens just screws onto the lens the camera comes with. The only downside with the lens is there is a very small black rim around the shot; with most fisheyes you wouldn't see such a thing, but it is barely noticeable. And when the flash is on, the lens will create a shadow in front of the subject. But overall, the lens is great, the shots I have taken look incredible, and the macro feature is brilliant! :)"
1,Wrong order sent!,"I really wish people would take the time to look at what they send. I got the wrong order and wanted so badly to use the fisheye lens. I got one for Polaroid. The only problem is that it does not fit with my Canon, which the seller said it would be sending but did not."
1,Fail,This product does not correspond to the specifications. Does not fit Canon Rebel cameras. 'll ask change product or sent as specified
4,Just what you expect,"Good lens for what you pay. My only complaint would be that the macro images are pretty blurry for the most part, but I purchased this just for playing around, so for the price, I'm definitely satisfied."
4,"Fisheye lens Screws onto existing lens, not camera body","It works just fine, nicely packaged with padded drawstring bag. This lens only mounts onto your existing 18/55 mm lens, NOT onto the camera body itself. Once I realized that I was able to take to really cool shots. Good wide angle fisheye lens for the price."
1,Lame,"Totally disappointed with this purchase!! It sucks! I thought I could get away with it until I could get the fisheye I wanted, waste if money!!"
1,Nice quality ! won't fit rebel xti !,"I was impressed with the quality finish ! I searched for some instructions much to my surprize ,there was no clue or decriptions. INCLUDED WAS A RING ADAPTER TO WHAT AVAIL? THIS LENS IS DESTINED TO BECOME A PAPER WEIGHT."
3,Not bad but expected a little more,"I purchased this lens about 1 month ago and I'm generally pleased with it. I have a Canon Rebel XTi with a kit IS 18mm-55mm standard lens. In a nutshell, here's what I think.The pros:- low price- lightweight- sharp image- includes lens bag- creates interesting effects- creates great macro shotsThe cons:- Compatibility with Canon 18mm-55mm IS lens. Requires 2 ""step down"" rings to mate the lenses together. As a result, this produces a porthole effect (which might be what you're looking for)- step down or up rings are NOT included with this lens- lens caps do not fit snug and always fall off. They're pretty useless.- edge detail falls off considerably (blurry) with blue edges forming on high contrasting objects.The verdict:To achieve the desired effect (fisheye warped / wide angle shots with sharp detail on the extreme edges), this lens does not do that so I'll be looking around for a true Canon / other band fisheye lens."
4,"Not a separate lens, but gets the job done","This is listed as a fisheye lens, but it is really just an attachment that screws on to an existing lens, but it gets the job done when screwed to my kit lens.I'm not sure what the function is of the sliding end piece. There are threads on it for another attachment or lens cap, but I don't see why it would need to slide. Also, I am not fond if the ""lens cap"" provided. It always falls off in the bag, and it made from flimsy rubber, and with the sliding end piece I mentioned before, it can be a pain getting it to stay on.The macro function is cool, and although I still prefer my 50mm macro for close-ups, it has a neat way to show a wide angle with a close focal point. Not sure if this feature is available or works as well on cheaper attachments.One other thing to consider is that since this attaches to the end of an existing lens, it might be hard to pack in your camera bag as it is NOT convenient to screw/unscrew for each use."
2,lens got stuck on 55mm lens,I bought this not too long ago. Two days after i put it on my 18-55mm lens like im suppose to and for some reason it doesnt wanna come off. But other than that its a alright lens.
1,46mm Lens Thread - Beware!,"This lens will not work with standard lenses as it needs a 46mm-(xx)mm adapter.I had to order another package consisting of 46 to 52mm adapter rings, which are cheaply made and contain weak thread.As a result, I want the manufacturer to improve their lenses by changing the default thread size from a 46 in to a 52, or more popularly a 58mm thread.Best,Anthony"
1,Not worth $20+,"This lens is awful. I am appalled that I paid any more than a few bucks for it and would not recommend shelling out the money asked for it. It makes all of the photos look like there is a mist or a haze over the whole entire picture. This is my first ""macro"" lens as well as my first fisheye lens and I am ever so disappointed. Apparently, I need to start saving the $1,500 Canon wants for a real one. I do know you get what you pay for but I have never been so disappointed in an off-label product as I am with this."
4,A stroker joker,"Invaluable to anyone wishing to really make their python happy. In my experience, if your python is happy so are you.Remember these are ancient creatures, used to roaming wild but now limited to hiding in dark damp places.The book covers all stroking angles and grips and features several pop up diagrams.Stroking the python has happened since ancient times, the romans, the greeks - even the welsh would list it as a passtime.The book mainly cover Molorus Trouserus, in all its many shapes and sizes. It tells you how to stroke your own or how best to stroke a friends. Also if you are uncomfortable stroking your python, it lists a number of London salons who will do it for you."
4,Pleasantly surprised!!,"I've passed over this book more than a few times because the summary and plot sounded so predictable and flat. Was I ever wrong!!!! This story was engaging and well-written. The pace was exceptional. The characters were not so overly-embellished that they appeared cartoonish. They were believable. The author introduced just enough additional characters to keep it interesting without diluding the primary focus.The ending was a little too quick of a tidy wrap-up in my opinion. However, it was not enough of a distraction to deminish the enjoyment of the story overall."
4,Great book!,"This is a great book. I loved the relationship between Jillian and Harrison. I loved Harrison Blake. He loved Jillian from the very first moment he saw her and protected her with his life. Although there were a few typos, you could overlook them because of the story. The mix of love and suspense was great."
5,Great Book!,"Giselle Carmichael has written a wonderful romance. Jillian and Harrison are not afraid to face the world as a couple. Their relationship was mature and passionate. The suspense and action, along with the steamy romance, kept me turning the pages. I look forward to this authors next book."
2,Call me crazy but....,I did not like this book. I feel that it was not written well and was very predictable. I like to read books from authors who are not as popular but for once I was really let down. I finished this book only because I started it not because it was good. The end had one surprise but that did not make up for the rest of the book. Read it at your own risk but don't say I did not warn you.
5,This Is The Best Piece Of Monkee Memoribilia I Own!!!!!,If you love the Monkees then this is most deffinetly a must! I love it especially all the background information that you get inside about each song! My fav song has to be Gonna Buy Me A Dog because the brilliant thing is that they give you the 'bloopers' version. What I mean is that as Micky and Davy sing the song they have a good all laugh on it to which is really funny!I bought this today [at a good price]in the United Kingdom to me this was a great price and I think it is deffinetly worth every penny!
4,Big Texas Tenor,"What a breath of fresh jazz. Carrol swings so naturally and his rhythm section shows how its done. Pianist Bernard Wright has played with so many greats and his solos and comping really say a lot on Freedom Sound and Jinrikisha. I have not heard an indie release with the smoothness and flair of this CD in a long time. The late Joe Henderson would be proud of his tunes' treatment. Curtis Lundy is a NYC vet and his big bass sound seems to flow so well with drummer Sebastian Whittaker. The tune ""As I Go"" is a great original and I only wish this group had recorded more of their own compositions. Maybe next time. This CD is a great one you don't want to sleep on. Peace."
4,Cleaning a Wok!,"I first saw these many, many years ago by watching the cooks in Chinese take-out places. At the end of cooking dish A, they throw this into the wok, pressing it down with the back of a ladle, and then using the combination to quickly scrub out the wok before moving on to dish B. Note that they come in two sizes; you want this, the Jumbo."
2,Sorry not feeling the love with this crust mix,So many strong reviews that I decided to give Betty Crocker a try. It's OK but tastes pre-processed and synthetic if you know what I mean. Its OK if you have company and want to make finger food but if you love pizza I think you'd be disappointed.
4,Thorough technical description of Moab area trails.,"Todd Campbell wrote this book from experience. His details regarding the trails, how to find them, what to watch for, and what to avoid, are excellent. Although written in as if a technical manual, (the lack of down-to-earth humor such as found in Cosmic Ray's books in Arizona) can be overlooked due to quality content. If you can secure both the Moab East and the Moab West topographical maps with the book, you will find the information infinitely more useful. Book contains details such as type of ride, length, difficulty, best seasons, elevation, land agencies, route summary, options, attractions, riding surface, logistics, trailhead access, and mileage log and route description."
4,trying to live in the wilderness,Sarah Bishop is a young girl trying to make it through the Revolutionary War. She has no family and no place to live. Her house got burned down the night her father was killed and her brother Chad was a prisoner on a British ship. He died as well. As she travels north she is accused of starting a fire. This makes her want to run farther and faster away from her home. She finally finds a cave and starts her life over in the wilderness. Scott O'Dell put a lot of detail into this book and he really helps you understand what Sarah is going through. This is a really good book. I recommend it.
4,Sarah Bishop,"After Chad goes off to war and Sarah's father gets tarred and feathered (because he is a Tory) Sarah has nowhere to turn. After that, she finds herself running from the British wherever she goes. After the help of many, she discovers a deserted cave deep in the forest. Soon, she is visited by the Longknifes, an Indian family that helps her to survive. I think that this book has taught many to love your enemies, as emphasized in the book. Although I disliked the vague ending, I personally thought it was a good book."
3,An ok read,"This book was exciting at some parts, but mostly boring. It was mainly negative.If you like history fiction, you will enjoy it. If you don't, I wouldn't get it. :)"
3,Cover has strong odor,"The steering wheel cover has a strong rubber tire kind of smell. It smelled really bad the moment I opened the box and since then, I've washed the cover, laid it out in the sun, let it sit outside to air out, and nothing has seemed to help. It does fit the steering wheel of the '99 Honda Civic well. It has a nice grip and look. In the last week or so, after the wheel cover was placed in the car and I frequently drove with the windows down, the smell has started to fade."
2,very difficult to put on and ripped,"this cover looks great on my car however it was very difficult putting it on. My steering wheel is 15"" and it says it should fit 14.5""-15.5"" wheels. I was 90% done putting it on and thought i finally got it but then it ripped. luckily it ripped when the blue plastic part so it still stayed together.Other than that it fits very snug and looks great so ill give it an extra star for it."
2,"Looks cool, but...","This steering wheel cover looks pretty cool (I got the silver and black one), but is smells AWFUL! And not to mention that it clearly states it can cause cancer and advises you wash your hands after you touch it. Who wants to do that??By the way, this will not fit any truck steering wheels, so don't try it!!If you can stand the smell and it'll fit your steering wheel, then go for it. As for me, I will be looking in other places for my next car accessories :)"
5,kool,"It was tough putting it on the str,wheel but once it was on it looked pretty kool i loved it (same color as my troka!) ' )"
2,"Potential, but it's gonna be hard","Not the worst blues/funk/rock type band on the landscape, but there are holes in the band you could drive a truck through.1. Band needs a singer...BAD. Hoo boy. You have to have a singer.2. You can't dance to hot licks.3. If you can't spend at least a decent amount of money in the recording process, don't make a record. This CD sounds like it was mixed with a Veg-a-Matic.Maturity may make this band better, but then again, it might not. The road to success is strewn with the carcasses of musicians who just...don't..get it."
5,ANOTHER WINNER!!!,"This is the sixth book on the 87th precinct I have read. They all have been good and this is no exception. The precinct is trying to find who ever gunned down a man who was walking down the street and why. The usual bunch is here, Steve Carella, Bert Kling, Cotton Hawes, Myer Myer(yes that is right) Hal Willis and newcomer Bob O'Bryan. Danny Gimp, the informer for Steve Carella shows up with information. Through much work the answer is found and one of the above is nearly killed. A fast read, will hold your attention and make you want to read the next one, if you can find it."
3,Grin and bear it.,"Further evidence that you don't need to be able to write (or hire a proofreader) to publish a book. If you can get past the second-grade grammatical errors, malapropisms, and punctuation gaffes, you'll at least learn something about another very sloppy enterprise: the Seattle Pilots."
1,I feel the same,"When this came out I bought it expecting another wonderful read-a-long story in the same line of the previous dozen or so read-a-long stories that Disney has released over the past few years. When we got to the car and realized it wasn't, I immediately went back into the mall to get my money back...if I simply wanted a story, I'll get the DVD (when it comes out)!!!A read-a-long is a valuable learning device, which takes advantage of a kid's enthusiasm over a movie to teach.An audio-adventure is simply a videoless DVD...what a waste!I hoped that Disney would see their error and rerelease this properly, but I guess not."
4,"Warms in your mouth, and not in your hands","First off, I really enjoyed the oils.The warming bottles say that they are *not* for intimate use, however, when they are rubbed on your back or feet you do not feel the warming sensation.However, if an oiled hand touches tender skin like lips or gentiles you *do* feel the warming sensation.This is sort of nice if you expect it, and sort of weird if you were wiping your mouth off and suddenly have tingling lips.I would definitely buy them again."
1,Is there someone conducting?,"I think the whole orchestra was sleeping during the recording of this 1812. There is absolutely no life in this music. I bought this version because the sound was supposed to be great... I was so disappointed! The sound is not even acceptable!If you don't have Antal Dorati's version of the 1812 (originally on Mercury), go get it! That's the 1812 to own! If you already own it, you will not find a better recording: clear sound, lively conducting, and the most powerful cannons in bonus!"
1,Defective - not openable anymore,"I bought mine 4 weeks ago. Once I had difficulty opening it but finally got it open. However since yesterday I filled with soup, it is so tight that I can no longer open it. Tried pouring hot water over or freeze. Nothing works. It is just so vacuumed tight that I simply cannot get it open."
2,Dead after less than a year,"This food jar worked great at the beginning, but last night I ran a side by side test of this food jar and a newer (& slightly larger one by Stanley). At 10:00 p.m. I put water that measured 204 degrees with a Thermapen instant-read thermometer and in both jars and sealed each tightly. At 9 a.m. (11 hours later) the temperatures read:1. Smaller food jar - 69 degrees, i.e., room temperature2. Larger, newer jar - 148 degrees, still above the ""danger zone"" for foods.These jars are supposed to keep food hot for 15 hours. So while I would trust the newer one for food heated in the morning to still be hot at lunchtime, the smaller one has to be trashed, which is too bad, because it's the perfect size for a side of soup, easy to clean, and the overlid functions as a bowl and is a good size for either sipping or for eating from with a spoon."
4,Food Jar,Very well made thermos and fits well into old style lunchbox. Must be preheated to provide hot contents 5 hours later. Best if using boiling water for preheat. Use hot tap water if expecting only 2 hour time period for storage.
1,worked only for first year and half!,worked great the first year and half only.now the boiling water would be lukewarm in less than 3 hrs.it is a disappointment.
3,"LEAKS, VERY VERY MESSY, NEED I SAY MORE!!!","I think the reason they dont put a handle on it is because they dont want you to turn it sideways!! I just bought me one of these bad boys only to find out on the first use that i cannot turn it sideways, soup started leaking out, now when i opend the lid, soup was everywhere, very messy, maybe i just got a defected one? after only 30 min. yes i said thirty min. it started loosing its heat. today was a test day and it did not live up. to its standards, on the first use....!!!!!!! i will be returning this today!!!!!!!!!update,I just got off the phone with the warranty dept. at stanley, they said that it is more than likely leaking becuase mine did not come with the gasket ring. so im going to bring the rating up alittle since mine is clearly defective. i give this a three star rating untill i get a new one and test it out, since the fact that not only leaks dosnt keep the heat in very well eaither,.. to be continued....."
4,Excellent Old School Thermos,"I bought a red on at the local Nob Hill foods. I also tried the same test that most people here did. I'm happy to report my soup was still ""too hot"" five hours after closing the lid. The size is just perfect for taking to work with me in my back pack. My only complaint is the plastic smell is taking a little longer to go away than I would like. Thinking of soaking it in hot water for a couple hours instead of the 20 minutes I did originally."
1,Sloppy and convoluted,"I had to use this book because it was required for the physiology course I took, and the test questions were taken from it. However, it is the most sloppy textbook I have ever dealt with. It is so cryptical and convoluted, it actually makes the material HARDER to learn. (For example, bizarre acronyms are introduced in the answers to sample problems that are never even been discussed in the text itself.) The different sections of the book refer you back and forth to one another without explaining anything in a basic way. In addition, the index is terrible, so you can't even try to dope things out on your own. I would advise you to not get this book if you can avoid it, especially if you are a student trying to learn this material for the first time."
1,Rent the movie...,"This book is written by an academic who is so far behind the times that he spends a good chunk of the book writing about, ""Hackers,"" the movie from 1995. Huh? The writing does not flow and the information is outdated. If you want to know about hacker culture go to 2600 - dot - org. Good thing I checked it out from the library."
1,Just bad fan fiction,This is just bad. Everything is a rehash of old plotlines & poor uses of the threads that were left hanging. Everyone sees their dead loves. (Tara & Anya) Old characters return for no reason. (Oz & Whistler).Stay away from this book.
4,Fairly good Buffy book,"Nancy has written a pretty neat followup to the series. The dialog sounds right for each character, and she's kept Joss Whedon's sense of humor. She also handles the last few episodes of Angel."
2,not great mats,"These mats frayed rather quickly, and discolored - I would go with Vinyl - the vinyl mats I have to replace these are so much easier to clean, and they are not discolored."
5,"Es mi album favorito, compositor increible y romantico","Escuchar la música de Michael Hoppe, es una experiencia fantástica, te transporta a los 'simples placeres' de la vida, 'see you in my dreams' es una exquisita pieza musical que recomiendo, para aquellos enamorados..."
3,Not as protective as I'd prefer,"I used to use the Staples branded mailers to mail my DVD's but thought they were a bit expensive at $1/each. I saw the Memorex mailers in another office supply store and thought I'd give these a try and waited to order them from Amazon at $0.50/each.Upon receiving them from Amazon, I was disappointed in the quality of the mailers. They are pretty darn thin and unlike the Staples mailers, it does not have an anti-static lining. I liked the lining for my discs because I figured it would also help prevent scratching. The outer surface is nicer than the the Staples ones and easier to write on however. The Staples ones were hard to write on as the ink would take forever to dry and often smear.The free CD marker included also has a very thick tip and I find it hard to write with. I like the ultra-fine tips on my Sharpie markers. Amazon has also jacked up the price from just one week ago by almost 100%. Why? I'm going back to the Staples branded mailers."
4,Memorex 12PK MAILER KIT ( 32021975 ),no indication of mailing issues yet. I'm not using them as much as I thought I would. It works but not enough data to give it 5 stars yet
2,"Contrary to expectations, difficult to follow, unpredictable","The Judas Mandala begins with a Maggie Roche living a hard and uninteresting life in the twenty-first century. Born in 1980, she is divorced, a mother, a poet, and unemployed. At the Unemployment Office where she receives her weekly allowance she is given an address she is to report to that night. When she returns to her apartment, she discovers a large sum of money has been deposited into her account.She goes to the address on the paper, and finds it is a large mansion. Inside, the same lady at the Unemployment Office greets her, along with a Professor of Psychology. The two give her an injection that enables her to travel, unaided, through time. While attempting to escape, she unwillingly moves into the future, winding up some four thousand years later - in a world where humanity is dominated by intelligent machines."
2,Poorly Revised Third Edition,I am disappointed with lack of current ESL/EFL research that is cited in this text. It appears that the contributors simply resubmitted their original material without significant change. This is unacceptable. A simple web search on the contributers reveals far more current work than contained in this text. This is taking into consideration that this edition was published in 2001.
5,thank you i got the book,"thank you for amazon, i got the book and sorry for answer this so lately. i hope i can get more information in here in the next buying"
2,Not the best of even the OLD Barbara Delinsky!,"I am a Barbara Delinsky fan, let me begin with that. Clearly her later works are more well developed and thorough. However, for light quick reading I have enjoyed books such as Fast Courting and Montana Man. Therefore, I thought I would give Carpenter's Lady a try.I found the book incredibly boring. The characters simply did not hold me interests, nor did the story line. It was a bit of a chore to get through.That being said, I remain a huge fan. Given the number of books she has put out, not caring for just 1 is still very, very good odds!"
1,"Misleading, don't buy it!! Old-fashionable and disgusting...","This is not more than a stupid romance, don't expect anything from it because nothing happens. What a shame! If I had read the reviews before, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Great book for recruiter with 0 to 3 years of experience,"Overall, this is a great book for a recruiter who has 0-3 years of experience. It gives a good overview of the world of recruiting and breaks it down. The author did a good job of compartmentalizing the book and supplying extra resources. How much can you really learn about recruiting from a book?After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about ordering this book knowing that it was covering a lot of info.The +'s1. It covers everything. If you're looking for a quick flip book this is it.2. There is a resource site where you can get more information on the topics.The -'s1. It's not as specific as I would have liked, but I understand when you cover so much information you truly can't put everything in."
1,This CD is ugly.,"All the bands on [...] pretty much [...] nowadays, so they decided to take the Get Up Kids material they own and put it back out. They released an ugly Four Minute Mile ""digimortal"" and also did the same with this. The music's great, but be rest assured, the Get Up Kids had nothing to do with the reissuing of these EPs in one really ugly package. If you can find the EPs, buy them seperatly, besides, there's not many of them floating around out there, so they'd be like collector's items, which is cool. Fact is, I bet the Get Up Kids would rather have you download the music or burn the EPs off of your best friend Randy. They don't want you to buy this, because they don't like it. Don't be put off, these EPs are by far the Get Up Kids' best stuff, especially Woodson, which is my favorite GUK song. But my point is, here's to us fools that have no meaning. I tip my glass to you. Yar."
4,Laughter is indeed the best medicine,"Most of the songs on this compilation I have on the three retrospective collections that Rhino put out in 1991,1995,& 2000 respectively-I'm glad that Frank Zappa's ""Don't Eat The Yellow Snow"" & Shel Silverstein's ""Smoke Off"" are included on this disc-They are classic bits-The weakest track on this collection:Dr.Demento's desecration of ""Shaving Cream""-Otherwise,I recommend it for lovers of novelty music everywhere."
2,"good schickele, bad strauss, even worse vaughan williams","The only reason to buy this CD is for the Schickele concerto, which is, as the other reviewer said, very under-rated and one of the best recent concertos for oboe. The recordings of the Strauss and Vaughan Williams on this disc are laughable. It would help if she could even get all the right notes (she doesn't) or play with any sense of phrasing (she doesn't), or in tune (she doesn't), I mean, take it from an oboe player, listen to the Schickele and then put the CD back in the case. If you want a real recording of the Strauss, check out the recent recordings by Richard Woodhams or Alex Klein, or of course the famous DeLancie recording, all are excellent (especially the Woodhams)."
4,Another great record from these guys,Closure is a very diverse record. There are tracks that old fans will love (Destruction) as well as some very moody trip hop stuff (Born On A Ray Of Sound). A dancefloor hit (Reasons) and one excellent PJ Harvey cover (The River). I really didnt expect to enjoy this record as much as i did but it has been in my listen pile for the last 5 months. I think this is their best album since The Coiled One.
2,Get what you pay for...,"These pinnies were very plastic like and are not really what I thought they would be. If you can't afford a better deal than go for it, but I would recommend the kind made of cloth with lots of little holes in them."
4,carbo gain,Carbo gain is a very good product not only does it give me energy but it also helps me recover faster from my workouts. I mix it with my whey protein powder after workouts and it works great.
4,Quantity at a bargain price,"This is great for post-lifting re-charge of muscle glycogen. And its a good additive to your water bottle on long cycling trips. I use a lot of it so I'm very happy to have it in this giant, economy size."
2,Does not mix well,"I always have to wait about 30-45 seconds for most of the VERY fine powder to sink to the bottom before I can stir with a spoon. I would get a big clump if stir immediately. Even after waiting, about 40% of the powder will always clump up and requires more stirring and mashing. It does the same in my shaker cup. I don't have this clumping problem with my NOW Dextrose powder and NOW Protein Isolate. I plan on going back to my organic brown rice syrup (Whole Foods) when I'm finished with the 8 lbs."
4,"Good product. Nothing miraculous, but it is what it says.","I'm a runner and I mix this with regular sugar and an inexpensive whey protein powder in a large container to make something resembling a typical weight-gainer mix, but it's exactly the ratio I want and super cheap. I mix that powder with milk and use it as a post-workout recovery shake. I find that pre-mixing the dry ingredients helps them combine with the milk more easily. When I put this or the whey protein straight into the milk, they clumped pretty badly. They still clump a little, but if I mix it up an hour or two before I drink it, they have time to dissolve well. I gave it 4 stars because it clumps up quite a bit when mixed straight in, but that's my only complaint and I'm able to work around it well enough."
5,Darling book.,"As a boy my mother read this to us and I loved it! Epaminondas is like so many children and takes things literally. He is my hero, he keeps trying and trying."
4,Good product,This is a good tool i would recommend this to people that are looking for a caliper that doesn't cost a lot.
4,A lil extra glossy,Dimensions exact and shipping on time. Only concern is that it's a little glossier than I was expecting as a poster. Framing it made it look a tad funny but it accomplished it's purpose!
3,school,"Not too bad, a bit tinplatish, has that toy look, will need to do some work to make look realistic, a good starting point though."
5,Beautiful!,"Gorgeous, intricate ribbon embroidery patterns. The book includes instructions for each of the blocks. The finished quilts made from these patterns are stunning!"
5,Good quality,"Nice heavy-weight, thick glass globe. Needed it to replace one on my 1950's era back porch fixture. Surprisingly hard to find item. Shipping wasn't very fast, but the item was well packaged."
1,Flawed Design,Volume control on this headphone (which made me to buy his product) is located close to the pin rather than to the headphone. Construction: Pin---VolumeControl with a clip---Coiled 15(or so) ft cord---headphone. Sounds funny. I returned the product.
4,It is worth it.,Worked as expected. I connected it with ease. I also liked the small connector form factor. I would purchase again.
4,"Daring, percussion-laced adventure","This was my first exposure to the Art Ensemble of Chicago and it was a good one. The sounds and styles on this album run the gamut from group grooves on various percussion instruments to racing, Ornette-like themes, and just good old fashioned group improvisation. When the band builds up to full steam it can really move air. Malachi Favors gets in some solid bass soloing. The wide array of instruments deployed on this album makes sure it never gets stale, with new textures and colors frequently popping up to add to the mix. Clearly the Art Ensemble of Chicago wasn't afraid to take risks and this one paid off in full."
4,Great book full of truth,Jameson is one of the best writers of history I have read. The way he gathers all the facts together and puts them out there for the reader to analyze is great. The truth is great to hear even though is conflicts with most historians. I would recommend this book to all.
4,A valuable reference,"A useful reference for the serious metalworker, with color plates of most of the patinas, and a helpful discussion of techniques. One deficiency is the lack of any information on the relative durability of the patinas under the effect of handling or weathering."
5,good music to listen to and dance by,The music on this c. d. is very good. The way he plays the guitar is fabulous and shows his talent very well. The songs he writes shows different moods. My favorite song is Lavender Evenings and Lace. His guitar solos are really very good and you know he has been picking that guitar for a long time.
3,Biased,"This book was an interesting one about risk management. However, I found Bernstein's depiction of the Catholic Church, or any belief in God, to be too simplistic. Perhaps his own bias came out in this book. He fails to mention that for the last 1000 years it was through the support of the Catholic Church that science saw many of its greatest achievements. This isn't a major part of the book, but he does convey overtones of his bias against the Catholic Church. He could have easily edited these parts out, but left them in for the wrong reasons."
4,Path out of confusion,"A show how complex problems of probability are, how long it took to understand more, and the way to this goal. However I question some of the conclusions on random walk or the influence of Chaos Theory. Still a very valuable guide, e.g. understanding the difference between the probability of an event and the single (unprobable ) event that can happen too."
4,Good overview of probability theory,"The sweeping story of probability and the related concept of risk. Interestingly, the modern notion of probablity was really not ""invented"" until the Renaissance. This fact hints at the fact that the concept is not intuitively obvious, and explains why people often behave in ways that are not consistent with basic probability theory itself. Bernstein covers how the modern notion evolved, and how it grew to be such an integral part of modern financial theory, including concepts such as diversification, portfolio insurance, and the advent of derivatives. Also covered are aspects of behavioral finance -- driven by the sometimes peculiar decisioning approaches of the human mind. This is an excellent book for any executive who is interested in decision making in general, as well as financially-related decisions."
2,Marginally interesting,"Not exactly a page turner, but I didn't really expect it to be. The writing was okay, but if I hadn't been required to read it for a class, I would have stopped after only a few pages. The title was more bold than the content delivered."
2,"Painful, but Intriguing","It was hard to finish this book. I couldn't put it down though, as I kept hoping the author would get to the point. He posed many good questions, but it didn't seem like he answered many. He lost credibility with me because of numerous logical errors.A technical person should not read this book, maybe it's more for psychiatrists, sociologists, or some other ""ists""."
3,History Buffs: Here you go!,"Against the Gods draws you through a vast time span. Peter Bernstein begins with the conception of the Arabic numbeting system, up through present time super speed computers. Although, the history found in this book is interesting, the title leads you to believe it is all about investment risks, however it is more of a history text book than a manual. This book is a story of theories and how they developed. You will learn quite a bit about ancient times and how things evolved into the way that they are now, but do not expect any great help or advice on how to deal with risks in the investment world. Once you get into this book, Bernstein's writing sytle draws you in. The book is interesting enough, Bernstein's knowledge of hisotry is astounding. History Buffs: here ya go!"
4,"excellent, but out of fashion","Very readable book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever had an interest in statistics. However, arguments regarding derivatives and how they spread the risk efficiently are out of fashion."
1,better transfers are out there,there are much better prints of these good movies out there than this poor looking disc!!!!
3,Update of my previous review,"I've got to revise this product downward. After I lost the ccd chip Nikon either gave me a new camera, or fixed the old one. I don't know which. They say the fixed it, if so why did they put those stupid colored stickers back on the body. I've decided that I can't use this camera for any kind of work because of the way it finds focus. I never know where it's going to focus in a scene. I did some simple ""stand up 'em up against the wall"" and the manual focus mark said I was focused on their faces. No NO, the camera focused on their chests and the faces were slightly soft. I was on a tripod shooting at 1/4 sec. I don't know if this is an adjustment problem or what. I just never know where it's going to focus. Pretty annoying. At least with my 35mm I can choose the focus point. I probably can with this camera also? Now which menu would that be on. If anything this camera is not simple or user friendly like the 900 line."
2,Disappointed in the coolpix 5000,Hi.I am a Nikon camera user for many Years.Using Digital and film cameras.I am very happy with my coolpix 990 and beliving the 5megcoolpix is a much better camera I have purchased one as soon as the camera become avilable.Big mistake! The camera not as good as the 990. The software excellent but the camera so far produced an unsharp photos and I find much slower then a 990.John Somer.
5,Great Camera,I had this camera for the last 2 weeks. It is the best digital camera I ever had. I keep on reading reviews from people who never touched this camera. Do not listen to them.It is a great camera with excellent quality pictures ( day and especially at night with a slower shutter speed).Sure you can find lots of inperfections:- Has a fixed lens.- Uses the batteries in a short time with the lcd on.I wonder if any of the critics will ever find a perfect product.Check the camera specs and compare it with other cameras in the same price range and you will find out that its is the best value for the money.
1,Not for Win7,"I bought this reader to download photos onto my PC which runs on Windows 7. It is slower than my old $15 USB reader! My PC tells me that the driver being utilized is a Microsoft driver dated 6/21/06 and that it is the most current driver available. A look at the SanDisk website shows 2 things: there is no SanDisk driver available for this reader for Win7, and that a number of other people posting on the forum have the same problem with no help from SanDisk."
4,works well,"This card reader works well and faster than USB 2 interface on my MacBook Pro or MacPro.As data transfer technology changes, I would be curious to see if there will ever be a e-SATA version of this card reader.Everyone is shooting with bigger and bigger memory cards but no one has made downloading faster as we all develop a 'wait problem'"
2,Better but imperfect,The reader is noticeably faster than my old Brand X USB reader. However it still does not reliably mount CompactFlash cards on the desktop. I often have to plug and unplug the reader several times before it's recognized by my MacBook.The reader is packaged in ridiculously hard plastic that requires sharp scissors to cut. The plastic itself is sharp enough to injure you after it's been cut if you aren't careful. There's no excuse for using anti-shoplifting measures like that on a product sold by direct mail.
4,"Fast, predictable and reliable","So I bought this because I was getting tired of the USB 2.0 transfer speeds and wanted to take full advantage of the Macbook Pro I bought that has a Firewire 800 connection. This reader has been working for the past few months without a glitch and has cut down my upload time. I like photography what I do not like is sitting waiting for my images to load. This little devise saves me valuable time and has already paid for itself.If time is money for you then I would consider this purchase as a worth while investment. Imagine if you could get something that could save you 10 minutes every time you used it. These 10 minutes add up fast.I wish I could ""buy time"" this inexpensively in other areas...."
1,Don't waste your money,"When I called ScanSoft's customer support I asked them one question. I wanted to know if PaperPort would allow me to scan in multi-page documents into an Adobe Acrobat 5.0 PDF the same way that ScanSoft's old product Pagis Pro would. (I am a resigtered owner of the full version of Acrobat 5.0.) Customer service assurred me that it would do just that. I received the product, installed it and found that I would have to scan one page in at a time and then combine them later into one document (unlike Pagis Pro used to do). Doing a little research, I discovered that Adobe Acrobat 5.0 would let me do my scanning like Pagis Pro used to do WITHOUT using PaperPort. Given the fact that I have other software that allows me to do EVERYTHING else that PaperPort will do (like editing pictures, etc.) I wonder WHAT PaperPort is going to do for me other than cost...? In one word, FUGEDDABOUTIT!"
1,Non-User Friendly,With the purchase of a Visioneer OneTouch 5800 came the PaperPort Vr7.02. After reading the HELP files I still am not able to use the OCR capability.I am not able to get to PaperPort on the Internet.I previously had Adobe PhotoDeluxe and OmniPage. I believe I'll reload and update them and go from there.
2,A nice try for Bobby's first CD,B.Brown's first CD wasn't anything special. It was rushed and only had two singles Girlfriend and Girl Next Door. If this album had more ballads maybe it would have been better.
3,Works well but...,"Works well, and keeps stuff hot for hours in freezing conditions, but it leaks. If it didn't leak, it would be perfect. Maybe they can redesign the top or something."
2,"Great thermal qualities, but plastic lid breaks.","This is one of the most thermal travel coffee mugs I own (and I own a lot). The lid has a three-piece construction, which is complicated but is easy to clean thoroughly. The problem is that the plastic is cheap and breaks. The whole thing came apart without warning and spilled hot tea on my lap. Too bad. I'll try again when Stanley figures out the lid thing."
3,"Useful overview, but not perfect","I'm not a CFA candidate, but I've been an investor for years and always appreciate learning more about the field. My father was president of the CFA for a couple of years, and after 15 years working on Wall Street I have a reasonably broad understanding of some finance.What impressed me most about the book was how short and terse the definitions were. Clearly they are useful and present good insight into what's important and why.What impressed me least was the lack of mathematical rigour (perhaps one can't have both brievity and exactness?). For example, many of the formulas only work for specific instances, and details about yield/rate conventions are omitted.Overall, it struck me as useful overview and quick reminder to financial analysis and the language/terms used. It's not really indispensable, and is not authoritative. But for a quick refresher, or ballpark estimates it's fine."
5,OUTSTANDING !!!,"This is probably the best Playboy Video I have ever seen, The women are gorgeous, the scenes are very well filmed. Playboy has really done a remarkable job. Its a must see..."
2,Just OK,"A quick-reference book. Lot's of remedies to try for hundreds of conditions and diseases.I am not a fan of Prevention, due to the fact that I have found some of their information wrong over the years. But as far as using as a quick referrence, this book is fine. As long as you have other sources to check it out."
5,Cars xbox,My mom buy it for my nephew and he loves it.Family hits from xbox 360 rules. Yeah.Thank you.
3,Low Volume Output,"I purchased this item to attach to my JVC compact stereo. It had a subwoofer port. I had to buy a patch cord to convert the subwoofer stereo jack to an RCA jack. After plugging it in and turning the subwoofer volume up all the way, I could hardly hear it. I'm a little disapointed with is't performance."
1,"Didn't Work For me, Either","This unit seemed to be picking up the wrong channel, the center channel instead of the subwoofer channel. Since it has a stereo plug, I could not figure out how to switch the channels, so I took it back."
3,Last Curt I will buy,"I bought this tubular hitch because I thought it was supposed to be hidden under the bumper...not at all...stick out and looks crummy.The fit was terrible....none of the bolt holes lined up, and I had to use a floor jack to force it into place. I still have one bolt that does not match up at all on the frame and is on an angle...I guess I will have to heat the frame rail. I should have sent it back but I need it for this weekend to pull a pontoon boat...it should be fine.Pretty disappointing overall. Last Curt anything that I buy....By the way, I used to be ASE certified, so I certainly know how to mount a hitch to a truck....poor quality control."
2,Wobble fly away pinwheel,"I ordered three pinwheels, and this was the worse. The wheels were lopsided bent out of shape. The area that the spinners are on, is not long enough, so whenever it spins, it spins off. Or due to the poor quality you are not able to put all three on, for they will not spin. If you put two on, then it will. Had to put a different piece on the tip and glue it so that the spinners won't fly away. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
3,Good product but not as discrption says,"According to the description ""Set Of Two Rainbow Garden Twirler Wind Wheel - Double The Beauty"", but only one was received. Pretty good quality. There are three spinning parts. I think there are better options out there, but I am happy with my purchase. Seller shipped promptly."
1,cheep junk,"They don't stay together in any type of wind, Very cheeply made. Would not tell any one to buy this ."
4,"Beautiful, large pinwheel","This is one of the prettiest pinwheels I've ever seen. We've placed it in a high-wind area, and so far it has not broken apart as other pinwheels in the same location have done. It is very large, so be prepared for that. Also make sure you put it together properly at first - the little wheel separators need to be put in the right place, as it's very hard to pull apart once you snap everything into place."
2,Sad.,Cheerful and colorful but 2 of the rings don't spin even after using WD-40. Flimsy and poorly made compared to another wheel that I also got thru Amazon.Sorry I can't find that company name because I would order from them again.
3,"Beautiful, but falls apart.","I love this beautiful spinning wheel--EXCEPT, that it keeps falling apart. It looks so pretty spinning around in the breeze, and then about once a day, it flys apart and the pieces scatter all over the yard. Thus far, I have had it set up for 5 days and it has come apart 3 times. The last time I couldn't find all of the little pieces to it. I don't know if the company has some suggestion for how to keep it together or not. I had another spinner for 6 years and it never came apart, so am quite frustrated by this one's problem."
4,Rainbow pinwheel,The colors and quality of the product are excellent. We've had some bad weather and it's still going strong. My onlyNegative comment is that I was not provided with all the necessary pieces to assemble it. My husband and I were ableTo assemble using pieces we had at home.
4,rainbow wind wheel,"Although the two I ordered were received promptly, one of the wheels on one of them broke within two weeks of purchase. But it still works and looks okay with just the two wheels. Overall I am pretty happy with this product."
4,From a 13-year-old,"Ok, for starters, I don't own this album.I've heard his songs on youtube, and i'm ordering every single album he's put out.When he recorded this album, Declan Galbraith was only about 8-10 years old. But he's already showing an absolutely AMAZING voice and a lot of talent. And that's an understatment. It just blows my mind that anyone this young could have so much potential; it blows my mind that anyone this young could RECORD A NATIONALLY SELLING ALBUM AT ALL!!!Since i haven't heard every single song from this cd, i'm not going to tell you 'it's worth every penny...a must-buy...you have to get it...' but from what i've heard of it, i'd say it's a good buy. I can't believe he isn't more popular than he is."
4,This book is great for amateurs!,"I use trigger points to relieve pain and this book has pretty pictures and gives you very nice descriptions and photos to let you know how to relieve some painful areas. Of course, if you haven't gone to school you won't understand the depth descriptions and so forth, but the pictures make this book worth the money."
3,We'd like more...,"I brought this booklet to acupuncture school and compared it with the other Atlas of acupuncture, the other students had. We all wanted all the information that all the atlas have, on a single booklet. All the acu. pts. plus TTP, ear pts., pulses, etc. Even if the booklet becomes a book."
2,Dr. Locke's Other Work is Much Better,"I wanted a practical, principled guide to leadership. Unfortunately, this title falls short: it is overly academic, with numerous in-line citations and relatively themeless discussion of technical issues. If it discussed ""the essence of leadership,"" I must have missed it. To the professional behavioral scientist, it might be useful, but to a general audience it is nearly worthless.For a principled, well-written text descripting the personality traits of successful businessmen, I highly recommend Dr. Locke's other book (""The Prime Movers"")."
2,A Rip Off,"The title, Bix Restored, is a bit illusive, unless by ""restored"" you mean dragging the master tapes around behind a truck over broken glass.As for the music, very few cuts on the first couple CD's even have a cornet solo!When you consider that the Hot Fives and Sevens collection is only twenty five dollars it becomes obvious that these publishers should be put in jail for charging this much dough."
4,"Good price, seems to be genuine","No problems w/ our replacement Oral B heads,bought 2 packs have enough for next 2 years!Have not noticed any of the vibration issues others have mentioned.So, keep smile'n"
4,Another great product from Oral B,Been using this for several years. Brush usually last me about 5 months. Works better than a manual toothbrush
4,good for some,"These are great toothbrush heads, but they're a little big for my mouth. so if you're like me and don't have a very big mouth, the smaller one might be better for you. My husband loves these though."
5,Power Brushing - Goodbye crusty coated teeth,"Wow, this will strip the paint off my house!. My teeth are soo clean after using this brush...never again use the single brush head. Wonderful, strong..but expensive. Its worth it."
1,Tongue Mangler !,"I've used the small round Oral B brushes for many years with no problems. The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue. If this is P&G;'s attitude towards product safety, I will avoid purchasing any of their products in the future."
5,Exactly what you expect,These are original Oral-B heads same as the one in the toothbrush so no surprises here. Great price for sure.
2,These are Terrific!,"I did love these brush heads at first, but after time, not so much. Takes less time to brush my teeth but does not thoroughly clean, especially the back and in between.Price is rather steep too...would be nice if the ""razor blade theory"" company would stop raping consumers!"
4,"Good brush head, very clean feeling after use.","I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well. I've been using it for about two weeks and still going strong, also I read the ORAL B mark will scratch off fakes, which it does not with these. I recommend saving some money and ordering these refill heads."
1,HD antenna,"Brought this one along with digital converter box,thoght it would improve signal but it was worst than the antenna that comes with TV I bought years ago."
3,MAC Sports Chair,"I ordered this chair, and probably would have kept it, but my husband didn't like it. The quality of materials and construction seemed to be very high; it was the design that was the problem. When sitting, the frame of the chair pushes the thighs together, and he found it a bit confining. Neither of us is overweight - the design might be even less comfortable for a larger person. So my rating is in the middle, since I found the chair to be reasonably comfortable, especially at the amazon.com price, and it was well-made. I did return it, though, for marital peace and harmony."
5,A Gem,"I agree with the editorial review above that says you could shake this book and nothing would fall out. I am amazed at how much emotion Flaubert can convey in the midst of apparently neutral descriptions of fact. The story is powerfully told, and nothing is wasted.The book is rather like a longer alternate version of Hedda Gabler. The author's unblinking eye shows you the virtues and flaws of all characters, letting the reader draw his or her own conclusions."
1,"Worthless, Worthless, Worthless!!!","They might as well have called this book ""Benji saves the universe"". It is foul in the extreme. I am wading through Calculus II right now, and this book is so unreadable...so thoroughly un-understandable...and did I mention the wrong answers in teh back? Jeez, you would think that by the EIGHTH edition, these losers would have finally worked out the editorial quirks from the first edition. In fact however, it has gotten worse. If you read the solutions manual reviews, a guy there says that there are correct answers in the fourth edition that are now wrong in the eighth edition. So in other words...this book is getting WORSE with time. Howard, Anton, and Biven should become cheese makers or widget fashioners or something...but not textbook authors. Save yourself the headaches, and try and take this course somewhere where they are not using this foul excuse for a book."
4,A extradinary good film,"When I selected this film to watch, it was on the preamble attached to the film, my surprise was how good it was, warm, realistic and wonderfully made. Well worth a second look."
4,Informational,I bought this a long with other reads as I was starting my own business out of college. There was a lot of good information and material.
5,Have recommended the book to many people.,Have recommended Organizing for the Creative Person to many people. The approach is easy to understand and not judgemental. It starts with the idea that people need to understand and accept their messy tendencies before they can cope with them. Problem solving approaches may at first seem simple but they are not. Just recently a young graduate student told me nothing had helped with her tendency to clutter and to have trouble with time except this book. The only problem she had with it was keeping it. Her sister kept borrowing it!
1,Disappointing,"I've been a Timothy Dalton fan ever since I saw Jane Eyre, but this movie is difficult to take even for the most devoted. Please do not waste your money."
2,Product is easily damaged in shipping,"The rubber dragonflies are easily broken. They probably were intact when packaged, prior to export to the USA, but somewhere along the way they get damaged. They would be better off not to install the dragonflies onto the birdbath at the factory, and just package them seperately, for the customer to assemble."
2,Thin copper coating.,"Good looking piece, however the copper coating seems to be defective. It is coming off in spots in the ""bowl"" part. This is very disappointing, having had the birdbath for only 8 months."
1,limited interest,"Misleading title. Should be ""Bowhunting in small lots in overpopulated areas"". Was hoping for more insight to whitetail behaviour under heavy hunting pressure. Not a lot of hunting wisdom. Incorporating ads for scent free clothing and tree slings is a waste of page space & insulting. Poor writing style. Hard to get into."
5,My favorite missal for daily use.,For those who attend daily mass the ease of using this missal is great. Tcalenders make it easy to find the mass of the day - the additional prayers help one to meditate and pray .
1,"Lovely music, if only it would play","I heard O Magnum Mysterium on the radio and ordered this right away, based in part on positive and negative Amazon reviews. One said something to the effect that ""he's still living in the 19th century."" It was intended as a criticism, but that's a good thing to me. The music is still wonderful, but the CD would not play properly. I exchanged it for a second copy and that one had the same problem. I ended up ordering a couple of different recordings of the same music, and am quite happy with those."
5,A refreshing surprise!,"+I had heard this music on WNIU-FM , our local PBS station. It was absolutely stunning. SO I found out the name of the composer and the performers which I had heard and ordered this CD from Amazon. It was perfect and the service was the same! I am most pleased with my purchase! Thank you."
3,replacement flap,I was not happy with the flap. Had to modify my doggy door for it to fit. I researched for the product using the model # off my doggy door and I rec'd the wrong flap. It does work but its not the correct flap.
3,Under Achieving Lounge Compilation,"Saint Germain Lounge (i.e. the cafe/lounge) and not the artist St. Germain compilied this 2 disc album. Seems to be a lot of confusion about that from previous reviews.Anyhow, both discs are compiled of fairly average tracks. Disc 1 has the album's major dud with ""Colours"". Neither disc have any stellar tracks. No mixing on this one except the minimal fade in, fade out between some track transitions. The layout of tracks is a little strange too with some transitions sounding very rough.Both disc 1 and 2 get 3/5 stars."
2,a little dissapointing,"I just finished reading this book and despite its recent media attention, I have to say that I was quite dissapointed. While entertaining, this books fails to offer practical information and the information the authors do share is not very sophisticated. For pure enjoyment, this book is OK. If it is practical information you are in search of, this book is not for you. No pictures are offered and the authors recommendations are vague. I much prefered Secrets of a Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon by Dr. Robert Kotler. I highly reccomend his book for those interested in practical information on cosmetic surgery."
4,A usefully broad collection of jazz hits,"For a newcomer to jazz, this is really quite a useful CD. It gives the listener a broad exposure to a lot of different styles and artists, many of whom were good enough and big enough in their time to have influenced how people thought about and performed jazz. There are lots of vocal pieces to learn about jazz phrasing, and some very dynamic instrumental work, as well as a host of jazz standards that you may be surprised to hear again. I bought this together withPure Jazz Encore, immediately doubling the usefulness, depth, and variety of the selections. This is a great CD to pick up if you are new to jazz, thinking about getting into jazz, or if you just want to have some around to play something different at your next poker/bridge game or cocktail party."
5,Wartime sermons from a Methodist pastor,"Twenty-two sermons that come from the pulpit of a church in London in the midst of WWII. In a long preface to the book Weatherhead describes the church, its people, and the situation of the war. He wants the reader to know the sitz en leben of these texts -- the life situation out of which they grew and in which they had their original meaning. The reading of these sermons is certainly enhanced by this knowledge, and it's safe to say that the timely Word is also timeless. Read! And come to know the friendship of the Master."
2,"Stones are OK, aligner is junk","I've used a variety of systems, but nothing is as simple to use as a decent bench stone. Bought this 5-10 years back, but the aligner was pretty much useless from the start and broke after a few months. The diamond stones are still ok, though, and I use them to sharpen my Global and other knives with harder than normal grades of steel."
2,Ugh...other reviewers must have been smoking their crack pipes,You gotta be kidding me! I bought this partly based upon the other reviews. Its atrocious. 3rd rate lounge singers no less. I think the other reviewers must have been listening whilst smoking their crack pipes. Don't buy!
4,A surreal satire,"In ""Bedside Manners,"" Luisa Valenzuela tells the story of a woman who returns home to an unnamed Latin American country after having lived away. The protagonist's visit to a country club soon becomes a surreal comedy in which sex, politics, militarism, and economics are all mocked and deconstructed.Along the way, Valenzuela satirizes the U.S. military presence in Latin America, the use of television as a narcotic, and other aspects of 20th century culture. A bizarre cast of characters--the imperious maid Maria, a megalomaniacal military commander, and more--enact scenes that are often funny, often disturbing. And throughout the unsettling refrain is repeated: ""Don't think. . . . Thinking's bad for you.""Luisa Valenzuela just might leave you thinking. This is an important work by a major writer of Argentina."
3,What's the deal?,"When I chose to purchase this CD, there was not any reviews available to help in my decision. There are three songs on this CD making up about 13 minutes of music. Though this music is very nice, two of the songs are the same song--one edited with the other one not I guess. I don't get it. This is really a surprise from Roger Hodgson. There is nothing available in the pullout leaflet to explain the mystery or intention behind this production. Until someone offers an explanation, I wouldn't purchase it."
5,"Better than the first, believe it or not!","I was very impressed when I picked up Transparent on January 23rd, the release date. Every song on it is excellent, and even more mature and beautiful than the ones on the last record, although their debut was impressive as well. If LaRue had just a little too much pop taste on their debut for you, I highly recommend that you pick up this album! As the reviewer before me said, there is a good mix of fast and slow songs. If you're not usually a lover of slow songs, be prepared to be blown away. ""Fallen for You"" and ""Brianna's Song"" are absolutely beautiful; you won't be able to resist them! Also check out ""Theory of Flight"", ""Near to Me"", and ""I Can't Sing"". You won't be disappointed in ""Transparent""!"
3,Cajun Proud,"The story by itself is good. However the Cajun setting and dialog was overdone and not always accurate. I have lived in Acadiana for a very long time and I enjoy reading books set in this region. A Thin Dark Line is not one of them. I had to put the book down too often and take a deep breath and cool off before picking it up to read again. I am sure that Miss Hoag meant no disrepect to our culture, but I found her portrayal of south Louisiana offensive. It seemed like an imitation of a James Burke Dave Robichaux novel ."
5,Wow!,"What a great book! Talk about suspense and romance. Tamie's got it nailed. I read this book in two days....I couldn't put it down.....my spouse thought I was nuts and I didn't care! I want all her books old and new. I love those set in the Louisiana Bayou. The repartee between characters is wonderful. Tamie, you're no. 1 with me."
4,Great Read,"This is the second book I've read of Miss Hoags. I thought it a little slow at first but it seemed to pick up somewhat in the middle Of course the ending floored me too !!! Enjoyed the french translations being I haven't studied it since high school Overall, pretty good. Couldn'tput it down towards the end."
5,A winner!,"This was the first Tami Hoag book that I had read, on the advise of a friend. I was very much impressed with the way that it was exciting from page one. I read this book in a day in a half. I usually don't have the time to read as much as I want, but with this book, I found the time. Buy it folks, it is all worth it. I also just read Guilty as Sin, and enjoyed it almost as much, but Thin Dark Line, was better in the fact that I didn't figure out who did it, until she wrote it in the book. Excellent book, excellent author. Brava!!"
2,Too slow-paced for a mystery/thriller reader.,"This was my first Tami Hoag novel. I was interested in it because of the fact that I am from the ""bayou country"". However, I was quite dissapointed. I love a good, fast-paced mystery/thriller and this was not the case. It took me a good 3 months, and several other books in between, to finish this one. The best part of the book was the beginning and the very end...everything else was boring. I will give another novel by Ms. Hoag a try before I take her off my best author's list.."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to her new book, but now that I am reading it, I'm having trouble keeping with it. My mind keeps wandering. Just now believeable to me"
3,Poor printing,"I was unable to read my copy of the book. I was very disappointed because I am a big fan of Tami Hoag. The printing was obscured by the right margin. I realize that this not Tami's fault, but something shoul be done about the printing."
2,Somewhere between 'ice' and 'fire' is lukewarm,"In 1985 Elton John, that ever-presented pop-superstar, released another album. This is not a total surprise, since he usually does that, you know, release albums.But Ice On Fire, although having a decidedly 80's sound, tries to avoid being typical 80's synth-pop by adding brass instruments to make it seem jazzy, and some songs could be classed as more R&B.; Trouble is, there aren't that many good songs on Ice on Fire.It's not bad. 'Nikita' is a nice song, and 'Soul Glove', is, as the title wants to point out, a nice ""soul"" song. And most of the rest isn't so bad; obviously Bernie Taupin's love of the time orbited around him because he says she's a 'Satellite', 'Candy by the pound' might give you diabetes, but it sure tasted nice on the way.However, the rest is usually in the middle ground between 'fiery' and 'icy'; i.e. Lukewarm. Rating **"
3,fair if i droped it off a bridge i wouldn't jump in toget it,"just when elton was on a roll with his last 3 albums,he basically stinks again here. There are slight glimpses of light on this album but not many.The first is in the form of cry to heaven ,the next is Nikita and then the rest is boring."
4,great gift,Was a big hit with my little red sox wannabe!I'm just worried he's going to outgrow it too fast.
3,Hire an editor for crying out loud!!!,"This book is a great book. Doesn't get any deeper than this, but I had a very hard time with the figures and the numbering. The text would refer to a figure that didn't exist but the figure above it would be the right one (with a wrong number). Also, a lot of the figures were missing components called out in the scenerios or text. As a previous technical writer, this book drove me insane to read. Also, the chapters needed to be broken up a little more. 100 pages per chapter is way too long.Otherwise, yes it is a good book. Tons of detail, however, you will be handicapped considerably without having $10,000.00 worth of switch and router gear just laying around. I bought Boson's Netsim hoping to help, and it didn't have any of the commands needed to do these labs. Bottom line, get the real thing if you can."
5,Cutting edge information!,"I think the difference between this book and the others is that this doctor is on top of everything because he's still doing it. The other authors have made tidy little books that read like muzak. This book is not only a hoot, but it's got information on unusual subjects that will come up that the others don't even mention. For instance, as ""natural"" and safe as some books make VBAC sound, this book is more complete by also discussing the downside of such things. Finally there is a balanced presentation that gives the total picture. Finally here is a book that trusts YOU to decide what approach to take. This non-preachy approach is a breath of fresh air. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and tell everyone to get it."
1,Unfortunate,"This is the kind of book for only a small segment of the population. Unfortunately this physician only sees birth as an emergency. In the process, he legitimizes all medicalization of birth. Indeed, he has a captive audience, since femininity is challenged and he is the savior each time.The irony is that the outcomes of all his interventions for the normal, healthy mother and baby pair are not looked at since it is all over for him after the delivery. Too bad he is not able to visit postpartum and see why the anxiety occurs predictably due to the birth experience for the mother and baby.I would not recommend this book to the general population---only high risk mothers."
4,Play-On,"I needed something for my wife and I to enjoy this summer. We normally go to Orchard Beach so I can play handball and she can play one-wall raquetball. Well that is too tough for a newcomer. So I bought the raquets for her to learn the game a little easier without having to chase the ball all over, and the paddles are a great success. Light enough for a woman,strong enough for a man. Sounds like a commercial."
3,Relatively good,"The HD quality was relatively good given the challenges of underwater photography. Lighting was surprisingly well done. The image clarity was slightly less than the best I've seen for HDThe music was decidedly not my style. It seemed very new age.I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in diving related content. I wouldn't hold this out as the pinnacle of HDTV quality, but it's relatively good. The subject is relaxing."
3,"Not Bad, Definitely Worth Owning","I bought this, because I love the subject. The photography is very good, and the pictures for the most part are quite sharp. There are a few scenes, mostly close ups that aren't quite as sharp as the rest, but they are in the minority of this disc.I do have issues with the sound. I found the 5.1 soundtrack to be rather bright sounding, to the point that it hurt my ears. The 2 channel ""mellow"" soundtrack was better.Overall, this is a nice disc, but not as good as my standard for this subject, ""Coral Sea Dreaming"", which is still better overall and highly recomended, but not available in HD"
3,The Kid in the Red Jacket,"The kid in the Red Jacket is a very good book because it is about a family that is moving.Howard does not want to go.Howard is the main character.The author of this book is Barbara Park.People who would enjoy this book would be people who are going to move or have moved.I give this book 3 stars.It was not the best of books because it had no riveting plot, but it was a good book to me."
1,Not a Good Book for Kids,This book is a very dull book because kids in ninth grade don't act like this. It was very boring to read because all it was about was having a boyfriend or girlfriend. I don't reccomend this to anyone because I think it is poor literture.
4,A quick read with a modern approach,"As one might expect from Cliff Notes, this book teaches all the necessary aspects of resume writing without superfluous detail. Both the chronological and functional styles are succinctly addressed, with additional advice on preparing your resume for scanning and Internet posting. More sample resumes would have been nice, but what can you expect from a 100-page book?"
4,A Bit Disappointed,"This is a newer version of a songbook that was first published in 1981, I believe. The saddest part is that six of the songs previously in the book are no longer there. Those songs are: ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,"" ""Mary's Little Boy Child,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Silver Bells,"" ""Sleep Well Little Children,"" and ""Toyland."" If you specifically want any of those songs, I suggest you look for a previous edition of this book."
3,Very dated,"This was published in 2003, but it is very dated in my opinion. The traditional Christmas songs are great, but it is also full of music I have never heard of before and I'm no spring chicken. It would be a good supplement to a more modern book. I love that it has guitar chords with diagrams, as well and good piano arrangements and organ pedal notations also."
5,Great purchase,The Merry Christmas Songbook is an excellent resource for traditional and popular holiday songs. The accompanying CD and Lyrics Sheet are an added bonus.
3,CD is unrelated to Book,"The CD that is included in this book is not related in any way to the arrangements that are in the book. They are not instrumental, they are bizarre choral versions of a dozen christmas songs."
2,fans of the WEST WING will love this,"I like sci fi shows like the original Trek, TNG, Farscape, Star Gate, and Firefly. Galactica is more of a straight drama with some sci fi which avoids many of the things I love about other sci fi series. There will be no exploration of different fantastic alien cultures on Galactica and that's too bad. It's more like West Wing than typical sci fi. That approach might be an attempt to attract more mainstream viewers, but I like more wonderous and fantastic sci fi series."
1,poor package,Universal didn't take the time to put this together correctly. They banged it out to make a fast buck. It seems that the rabid BSG fans don't care about quality because they are giving it 5 stars! BSG cultists will lap up anything. Casual watchers should beware. Read the negative comments before spending your cash on this poorly made product.
4,Great start to a great series,"This mini-series re-envisions the Battlestar Galactic universe in an exciting way. The story is fast paced and sexy, the acting is fantastic. All of the actors returned for the new series, and having seen all of the episodes for that already, it is even better than this mini-series. A great intro to this new Battlestar Galactica universe, and a great gift for any fan of the new BSG!"
1,Great movie- poor product,"I rented the movie to watch the end as despite the lack of scratches on the DVD, the movie stops at a point and cannot be read by any new or used DVD Player. The product was made faulty and unfortunately by the time I had the time to watch BSG, and try it on other DVD players it was too late to return the BSG DVD."
1,Why did They Ruin it ???,Why is this new Battlestar so annoying and vulgar?Its not innocent anymore! I like to watch the old ones with my kids but these are too adult oriented for young kids.
1,Not even good enough for one star,"Yes, I am a true original fan and this did the show NO JUSTICE.Starbuck as a woman??? I DON'T THINK SO.....sexy cylons???? PLEASE GIVE ME A BREAK!!!And then that horrible scene with that cylon lady and the human baby???? I was so apalled, shocked and horrified that I think it should never be watched by anyone ever again!!"
4,good mainstream TV for normal people not geeks,"Battlestar Galactica '03 is good mainstream TV for normal people. This isn't typical sci fi and that's why it's great. New Battlestar attracts normal people who love mainstream TV and not geeks who love childish cheese like Stargate, Trek, Babylon, Dr Who, and all that other geeky garbage. There's nothing cheesy or childish here. This is SERIOUS MAINSTREAM TV that doesn't stretch the imagination and that makes it adult and superior to the fantasy crap most sci fi geeks watch. The sci fi elements are largely down played so that things are normal and very close to reality. New Battlestar has characters who could just as well come from a reality TV show and not a work of fantasy. The plot captures the real tragedy of 911 and the war in Iraq. It isn't some complicated weirdo escapism show. It isn't funny. It's SERIOUS. Don't like this? Get a life! It's time to be mature and join the mainstream!"
2,I miss the original,"I enjoyed the mysticism of the original series and it's fun escapism. This new one has missed the charm of the old one. The new Starbuck just doesn't make me laugh as much as the original who would ""bruise easily""! LOL! THAT was a fun series! It didn't take itself too seriously. This new one takes itself WAY too seriously for my taste."
2,save your cash,i wasn't impressed with this mini and i really wanted to like it. the picture quality of this dvd is awful and it's not worth the money. they couldn't even bother to label the extras disc!
2,a ponderous start,"Battlestar starts out slow, picks up in the second half of the mini, and continues to wander along as the series goes. There are some exciting moments along the way, but most of the time it's dull. The pacing of the first part of this mini is especially slow. You'll need to see the mini before watching the series, but you should watch this on TV before you buy it. Better Christmas gifts would be DVDs of the Sopranos, Deadwood, or Firefly."
3,3 stars for this DVD - 4 stars for what was on NBC,I saw the NBC version of the new Battlestar Galactica and it was much better than the longer version being sold here. NBC removed an hour of B.S. that just slowed things to a crawl. It's impossible to cut an entire hour from something and still have it work under normal conditions but the fact that Battlestar works fine in a cut down form lets you know it was padded and ponderous when first shown. Recent reviews on here prove that people love what NBC did to this and showing a shorter version is what Sci Fi network should have done in the first place. Just remember that this DVD is the badly padded version and not the better version shown on NBC.
4,Makes all of the SG-1's look like garbage!!,"Finally, the Sc-Fi Channel shows an excellent sci-fi sries!Forget the terriblly boring SG-1 series, along with its lackluster Stargate Atlantis - The new Battlestar is far and above those two series put together. Grittier, filmed better, written better, acted WAY better - Galactica is sexy and sleek.You want action and adventure on a Hollywood scale? Look no further, pal."
5,A New Classic,"Quite simply, the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the finest shows (sci-fi, or otherwise) ever to air on television. Steeped with complex characters, fantastic writing, an immediate sense of reality (thanks in large part to a well-cast ensemble) and jaw-dropping special effects long overdue in a weekly science fiction show, this is ""must-see-television"" at its best. Add to all of this the stunningly beautiful Tricia Helfer... with drop dead gorgeous looks and acting talent to boot, don't be surprised if she becomes a HUGE star in the next few years. Do not miss this new Galactica!"
5,Good Miniseries,"If you enjoy science fiction, then you will like this show. I am a huge stargate fan and I like most sci fi. I would definitely recommend this."
2,sterile & hit and miss,"huge fan of dark sci-fi (DARK CITY, ALIENS) but didn't find this dvd captivating. it seems so sterile at times and then they hit you over the head with the 'angst' and it's too contrived. this is very hit and miss. sad that they didn't do this better."
2,Battlestar Galactica Purists BEWARE,Im gona keep it short and sweet!Negatives:1. Starbuck is now a woman2. Boomer is also a woman3. New Cyclons now look human4. Apollo is a JerkPositives:1. Action is very good2. Special effects
2,Lousy PQ but great series,"As others have said, this set is included in the Season One set, so don't buy this separate version. Besides, the picture quality--even for a regular DVD--is rather poor here and much better in the Season One set.The series itself is compelling, so I'm hoping that Season Three will be available soon."
4,nostalgically psychotic,"My father had seen this as a boy when it was first released and had talked about it as one of the scariest he had ever seen. By pure luck, I was at his home when it came on an old movie channel. We sat enthralled for the hour it was on. Well worth the watch and as good as he remembered!"
2,Waste of money,"It is just as effective, and much safer, to clean your Camelbak with a vinegar or baking soda solution. The cleaning tablets are chlorine based and therefore potentially dangerous. Wish I had known better and not wasted my money."
5,Excellent Work for Any Student of Lynch-Era America,"An excellent source work for any serious students of lynching. This book was very helpful in my work as a graduate student and comes highly recommended by numerous professors of history in academic institutions. It helps to give insight into a part of American history at times ignored by the general public. Readers of this work may also look into writings of those as Leon Litwack for similar accounts of lynching, anti-black riots and general violence in post-Civil War to mid 20th century America. It is good academic as well as popular history."
1,Attention Professors- Please don't require this to frosh,"I was forced to read this book for my freshman university seminar on social change. I regret every page. My fellow classmates and I waded through the dense redundancy of this book for two weeks. All that I learned in the 297 pages of this book could be summed up in one paragraph. I understand this book may be excellent for sociology scholars, but undergrad music majors will not be so apreciative of all this book is attempting to say. Professors, I beg you, please do not require this book for freshman reading. Thank you."
4,Great coloring book - NOT the one shown,"This is a really awesome coloring book, BUT it is not the one shown above. I also got the Anakin to Vader book that another reviewer got. HUGE problem for me though. My 3 and 6 yr old boys have only seen Episode 4 and do not know the secret of Darth Vader, so this book will have to be put away for a few years. I specifically piked the photographed book because I thought it would be safe for them. I don't want the surprise spoiled!!! Would have been 5 stars if it had been the right book!"
2,Too complicated,"I've read several of Clancy's inside looks into the various military branches and have found most of them informative and pleasant to read. This one, however, gets caught up in minutia and especially numbers. I found it taxing and not near the pleasure to read that the subject matter would seem to lend itself to."
2,Maby a bit to nationalistic?,"What Tom Clancy has in writing skills and acces to tecnical info he almost manages too loose in nationalism. As an Italian I don't have the arrogance to think that the Italian Air force is any match to the USAF, still if he could manage to have some consideration for such countries as Russia, the U.K. and Germany the book could of been better. Plus I find it rather insulting to be contineuosly reminded that ""any nation to cross the USAF should think again"".Next time keep it technical, Tom."
1,Terrible. Don't waste you money!,"I don't know how you could mess this up, but they did. Like everyone else I wanted a nice fireplace scene in 1080p. What I got was something my grandma would record and give to me. Every one of the fireplace selections is zoomed in and not very different in configuration. How hard would it be to produce several scenes of beautiful fireplace settings rumbling in high quality uncompressed audio? It's obvious they produced a low budget product hoping it would sell simply because it's released in Blu-Ray format. Don't buy this. I recommend buying a fireplace scene on upscaled DVD until a respectable product is released on Blu-Ray."
3,Just OK!,"The design is nice but the quality of the ring itself is less than average...it ""cracked"" when I tried to adjust it to my finger...it's loose (hence the fact that it's impossible to adjust without totally breaking it)...however, if you've got fat fingers maybe it would stay put?!?!?! Difficult to say...The seller however is amazing! I had a problem with my order and they got back to me via email within the hour!So I guess the saying ""You get what you pay for"" just really rings true in this case! ;->"
5,Works as it should. Easy to install.,"I purchased 4 of these solar panels. They were easy to setup, and have been working just fine for the last month. They have been operating at near the specified 80 watts each which is pretty good for December in Utah."
5,Just like the show,"If your child likes the JoJo Circus songs this cd is for you. It has the theme song, Goliath teeth brushing song, plus more. This cd has been a delight!!!"
2,"PLEASING TO KIDS, PERHAPS.","Nearly every scene of this featherweight film set in the early 20th century is directed at an andante tempo, its story concerning a youth named Byron (a lacklustre Brandon DeWilde), a runaway from an orphanage who finds a home in a quiet Missouri town named Delphi, thanks to the editor of the local paper, played warmly by Gary Merrill. Byron is not, however, a favourite of wealthy but harsh land owner Tobias Brown (Lee Marvin), who teaches the lad lessons of life the hard way; their conflict forms the kernel of a torpid work that does benefit from a strong performance by always reliable Paul Ford as proprietor of a small cafe, but that is sunk by flaccid direction and hackneyed dialogue."
1,Worst MYOB upgrade ever,"We've been using MYOB for our book keeping software for six years now, until this this release, I've had nothing but praise.However, this version, despite the additional bells and whistles, is slow at best (System: Dual 533 processsor, 384 megs of RAM, running 10.1) and very unstable. No news is available from MYOB as to when any fixes maybe available and the ""Marvin"" FAQ search is all but useless.Multi-user problems still have not been fixed, months after OSX was publicly released. MYOB is really working hard on correcting that. Yeah,AccountEdge 1, in my opinion, ran much better. It's a shame that MYOB forces users to upgrade since they only offer a 2002 payroll update for AccountEdge 2 (which is also flawed)."
5,Tight as hell!,"Right when i popped this cd in I sensed a very futuristic feel to this album. Although this CD from Clever features many basic 2-step patterns in the beats, there is much filler through quick mixing and a showcase of many styles. It all still had a futuristic feel with some of my favorite cuts like - the static 2-step beats of 'Time Traveller', the space-like acid twitter melodies of 'The Tubes', the free feeling melody of 'Oshima', and the heat of 'Smoking Man' and its quick shuffles into 'Steel' with its Rastafarian vocal and changing hats. The ending is amazing through the last three cuts with some IDM/DnB in 'Love Session' to calming synths of 'Deep Sleep' and the abrasive yet funky basslines of 'Coral'. This CD is very relaxed in a way with lots of melody and easy-going beats with lots of FX over them. You still will want to nod your head when listening though. A good Buy!"
3,Better instructions are needed,"I have had trouble getting the information in to the program. There are no instructions as to providing ""Mr. and Mrs."" for mail - no instructions for what some of the categories are for. If I could figure it out, I think I would like it. So far, I have entered some addresses but have not been able to use the program successfully. Wasted money? Maybe not. Maybe I just need more time to figure it out. But........ A suggestion would be for someone writing software to try to use it."
3,good animal characterizations; a little 'preachy',"This is my least favorite in the foxhunting mystery series because I think Ms. Brown gets off-track of the story a little too often. She seems to promote her own view of political issues, products (she doesn't like Chevy truck ads - what does that have to do with the story?), and how wonderful, perfect, strong, fiesty, and even sexy the seventy-something 'Sister' is. I get the feeling that the author is describing how she sees herself being viewed when she is that age. The mystery story line is only so-so. The elements of foxhunting are, as usual, interesting to me. The characterizations of the animals are very good - that is one of this author's strong points."
5,haha wait,"someone above me said ""The first time I heard this was at a party."" I just want to say that must have been the worst party EVER. otherwise, if you're like me and spend your time alone, so alone, then this is the best cd to have a party with yourself to. a death party that is, suicide punch + weird phone calls to your close friends at 3:30am."
5,Last voyage of Queen Mary and more,"I enjoyed the pictures of the twins and the other kids. Hearing about the old days in Fulton, NY made me yearn for old verities."
3,Solar Birdbath,The birdbath is well constructed and the appearance is pleasing. The solar fountain works only under ideal conditions. It must be cleaned virtually every day. A lot of development remains to be done in building solar panels. I doubt that the solar fountain feature adds enough (if anything) to the product to be worth the effort.
4,The Gift of Place,"This non-linear piece of prose is elegant in its ability to take us to a place now long-gone. Capturing the life of a meadow on the high plains of the Colorado Wyoming border, Galvin creates a rich and vivid description of life over a 100 year span.His main character, Lyle, is a true man of the old farming west and a lover of the land as it was. Galvin's ability to create mental pictures of people, land and life makes the book a enthralling read.Don't expect it to move quickly, although the entire book is done in vignettes. Don't expect to remember all the characters, especially if you lay the book down and don't pick it back up for a few days. Even with these reading challenges, the book is a gift of great writing and a glimpse of the past."
5,Seriously Funny,"OK, I know two of this book's authors, and yes, I saw portions of it during development, so I had an idea ... but I wasn't prepared for the insight, the wisdom, the sheer genius that is Clean Business Cuisine. Finally, a management book for Terry Pratchett fans!Hyperbole aside, Clean Business Cuisine has serious business concepts clearly, concisely, and (very) amusingly made. Accessible and interesting to managers, entrepreneurs, and even those not interested in ""business."" Very worthwhile (and I say this despite the fact that I had to purchase it myself, and did *not* receive a complimentary copy signed by the authors - hint, hint)."
5,Brilliant,"As a student at the music school which Renée Fleming attended and is worshipped, one would think that I would agree with the reviewer who compared Natalie Dessay unfavorably to her. But I've never really liked Renée Fleming; she's very good, yes, but her voice isn't distinctive enough for me to call her a ""great"" soprano, lyric or otherwise. Dessay's performances of these relatively unknown selections are flawless, with the possible exception of Rachmaninov's Vocalise, which is more for a lyric soprano. True, Dessay's ultra-thin tone can be piercing, but it's worth it to hear intelligent interpretations of songs that I haven't heard eight million times before. And her coloratura technique has got to be among the best in the world today."
5,Hilarious but not for the faint of heart or politically correct.,"I laughed my butt off. Lisa takes it easy on NO ONE. Every race,color and sexual orientation is fair bait. If you become offended easily, Lisa isn't for you. But, if you can laugh at everyday life and humans in general, give her a listen."
1,Pretty Bad...,"So the best part of this glove is it's photogenic quality. The strap on it is the flimsiest elastic you can buy. The closure is a 1"" square of velcro attached without any regard to looking nice or even staying attached. It is vinyl, like cheap car seat material. The inside is so coarse that it will make your fingers raw. Seriously, a band aid and electrical tape wrapped around your finger does a much better job than this. There are a lot of really nice release gloves out there, this is is not one of them."
2,Opus 25112,"I purchsed this feeder which is lovely and the birds like it(even a woodpecker)beacuse it was advertised as ""squirrel proof""..BUT it is NOT squirrel proof...The squirrels still enjoy eating the bird seed just as much as they did from the non-squirrel proof one I had..they can't tell the difference except this one holds more seed..."
1,Too little product for the money,"When I saw it on Amazon, it said ""Multi-Pack"" and that I save $82.28Imagine my surprise when all that came was 1 (one) box. I paid $9 for the box of dishwasher detergent.I feel really silly. I am not going to ship it back as I am out of detergent but I am not going to buy that again.What do they mean saved $82.28? Is it really sold in the stores for $90 a box?I am disappointed.."
5,Rudy's Review,"Manny Ibay's ""First things First"" approach to having it all is refreshing and easy to understand. Defining the real world in a brisk ""say what you mean, and mean what you say"" style, it informs and inspires the average Joe to become exceptional. Upon reading the book you begin to believe that it is possible to do what you want, when you want no matter where you are right now. Thank You, Tony Robbins is a real life portrait of the classic underachiever who transforms his life with a steady diet of mental exercises. The powerful mantra ""Massive failure before massive success"" is exemplified in quotes from Mr. Ibay's daily journal which allows the reader to eavesdrop and compare his or her own pain with Manny's humble beginnings."
3,Feedback is important to success!,"We're all on the same ship towards success, happiness, and awsome relationships. I think Manny is still learning what it takes to be his best self, and someone could potentialy benefit from Manny. At the same time I give this a 3 star, because it's not just what Manny mentions, but what he fails to mention that will hold his readers back from success."
3,Not bad,"I suppose it's unkind to be critical since this is for such a good cause, but I was a little disappointed with this CD. I expected to hear the same song in very distinct, different genres but honestly, I think a lot of the tracks sound too similar. Perhaps it's ""nice"" that artists with different styles can ""come together"" and record a song, but I would have liked to see a more defined R&B; version, pop version, etc. The standout song is the Fred Durst version which, in a word, ROCKS. The last track is a great club mix.All in all, I'd say for [price]and a worthy cause (two actually), this CD is worth a listen. It's a very good tribute and you'll be glad it's in your collection 10/20 years from now."
5,R E V O L U T I O N !,"Guerrilla Warfare and a Message to the Tricontinental are Che's most important writings, detailing his ideas for international revolution by means of guerrilla warfare. Lets create one, two, or three Vietnams!"
5,Che Guevara has a wonderful book,"Che Guevara delivers a wonderful message on how to ruthlessly smite your foes by KILLING THEM. Wow, what a great message, this book should be read in Kindergarten classes and at church"
2,Che',"An interesting read...if you're in the process of trying to overthrow a third-world dictatorship....With the exception of Cuba, Che was never involved in a successful, much less serious, insurgency against a standing government. Many of the lessons taught by Che in the book, some of which were practiced by the Viet Cong are useless against a well equipped and trained counter-insurgency force, as was the case in the later part of Vietnam. A fact few people realize is that the Viet Cong insurgency had been crushed by the end of the tet offensive, and even before then their achievments had been minimal at best. Che's own lessons, in the end, helped very few people, including himself. The Congo was a disaster for him, and in the end he was killed by Bolivian forces guided by CIA operatives and Green Berets."
1,Che (an incompentent commander) didn't even write this book!,"When one of Castor's commanders in the field asked him for instructions Che himself admitted that ""he knew nothing about military tactics."" He said so himself! This book is more myth than reality. It is nothing more than a compilation of Castro propaganda for those enthralled by the cult of Che.For a real picture of what Che was like read the accounts of people that actually served under him in Humberto Fontova's book: ""Exposing the real Che Guevara and the useful idiots who idolize him.""Exposing the Real Che Guevara: And the Useful Idiots Who Idolize Him"
1,Che Speaks But says Little.,"One of the most over-hyped and over-glamorized ""revolutionary"" figures in history makes us wonder if he ever really existed. Most of the Che mythology was pure fabrication and had no basis in fact. Hollywood couldn't have invented a figure more groovy, sexy or better-looking, even if it wanted to, but the international communist movement did. As Che and the entire cast of bigger-than- life ""revolutionary"" characters are fading fast into history, to be forgotten forever, you'd better read up on this macho man."
5,A must read,This book is great from cover to cover! You cannot go without this in your life. I couldn't put it down.
1,disappointing,"Having read and recommended several of the author's other books, I was disappointed to find that this one is different, just an excuse for porn."
5,Lardner book,"This was for my husband. He had read it years ago. Re-reading it today, he says it is just as funny as he remembers it!!! It was an early Valentine's Day present!"
3,Really small and didn't come in time,"I ordered 10 of these for an event and they came in 4 different shipments and one didn't come until after the event was over. As far as the product goes, it was smaller than expected but seems to be fairly durable so far"
1,Steaming Pile of Plastic!,"I purchased this mouse back in Feb '05 for gaming use and the buttons absolutely do not hold up to Shooter gaming where the left and right buttons are used fast and frequently all the time. Just so you know, I am on my FOURTH replacement from Logitech in FIVE months! Each MX510 has been lasting about 4-6 weeks of gaming and then the left and right button fail every time. After this fourth fails I am going to some other brand ... Logitech is not putting out the quality here. This is not an uncommon problem ... do some research and you will see that other gamers have the same complaint."
3,Not Better than MX 500,I own MX 700 and MX 500. The MX 510 seemed the logical choice for gaming. I use a Mac G5 with Tiger. The MX 700 is far from precise. THe MX 500 tracks smoothly and very precisely. I tried the MX 518 and that didn't work with my Mac at all. I was suprised to find that the MX 510 from Amazon behaved oddly. THe LCC software did not recognize the 510 and the right click button was totally DOA. This may just be a defective item so I won't knock Logitec. But it clearly tracks exactly the same as an MX 500. The MX 518 has much better tracking at higher reslution but you need a PC. This is the first time I have ever had to return anything to Amazon.
2,This game was not to fun,"I didn't really like this game. It really wasn't that fun for me. I used to really like the C&C games, but now they aren't that fun for me. One thing that I hate is that there are no cheats. I hate this. I really hate games with no cheats. I think games are more fun with cheats. I don't realy reccomend this game, but it's okay for the first couple of days you have it."
5,Roxie and the hooligans,"I liked this book because it is an adventure book.Roxie is a school girl with very big sugar-bowl ears. She is picked up from the trash and dumped into the sea with the hooligans. They swim to an island and live there for a while. She has to steal food and water from the thieves.Roxie is able to figure out a way to get away from the thieves who are on the island that she is stranded on.When Roxie and the hooligans are trying to escape, the helicopter zooms above and out comes Roxie's uncle. He saves them and the police catch the thieves. Roxie tells her parents and uncle all about her adventure.I think a person who is very adventurous would like this book. He or she would be amused by the way Roxie saves the day.I give it 10/10."
5,A great read!,"I first read Roxie for a class on chapter book writing. I read 75 books for that class. When it was done, this book was the best by far. I've read it three times now, enjoying the perfect juxtaposition of silliness and painful truth, fantastical and real, I don't know how she did it, but I sure wish all children's books were this good. Although the protagonist is a girl, I'm pretty sure boys would enjoy the book as well. I'm giving it to all the young readers I know this Christmas."
4,Better than Case Files for Internal Medicine,Used this for I.Med review. Good overview. Not like Shelf exam but still useful. MKSAP is better but still worth the buy. Case files not very helpful.
4,What a cocktail...,"...a true story with all the elements of a Bruce Willis/Tom Cruise movie: political conspiracy, drugs trade, sex, glamour, bad-old-Miami, gangs violence, lots of cash, unsolved murder......I'm so much looking forward to watching the feature film."
2,squirrels thought this feeder was delicious...,"This feeder is made of a plastic tube and plastic bottom. Pretty standard stuff aside from the thin copper top and thin copper bands near the openings. The quality wasn't what I'd imagined, but my expectations weren't that high when I ordered it. I was looking forward to the copper aging and eventually looking pretty cool.There's a distinct possibility that the squirrels in Maryland are just darned mean, but they disassembled this thing in roughly 4 hours. The feeder openings, to their minds, weren't big enough. So, they expanded them. When the copper got in the way, they just tore it lose. The openings became so sharp and jagged that I feared for all my critters' safety. The service life of this feeder was less than 2 days.Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on a good quality feeder, like one from droll yankees."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY BAD QUALITY,I had this MP3 player about a week when it started to act funny. For example the butins stopped working and no matter how many tomes i replaced the batterys multiple times but i still could not hear the music in my headphones so i reaplaced the headphones and still could not hear both output jacks did not output any sound into headphones or speakers. If i were to buy a nother MP3 player i would not buy any thing from Microtek
3,Very cute!,"They were very cute! Perfect for my 2-year-old's birthday cake! Although it may not be so obvious in the picture, they are each attached to a little round 'platform' on the bottom, so they stand up well on the cake. They are a little flimsy, but they can be used as toys after the party, if you want too."
5,Excellent mix!,"You definitely get your money's worth with this 2-disc set. It contains an excellent blend of music from all over the world, with a laid-back groove that is great for long drives, or long sessions at the computer. It was definitely worth the wait!"
3,Breaks really easy,When putting it together you have to be really really careful or it well break and they don't send you spare parts for it so I must say you well need to buy wood glue if you want it to last long.
5,Must have series for young children,"Ann Blades has created 4 seasons full of beautifully told adventures of two siblings. What is so special about these books is that there are no words written, which allows the caregiver and child to create their own adventures, different each time. We will be keeping these books for our grandchildren!"
5,1 dim metra dash for ford focus 04,"Excelent product, very easy to install, looks great and there is no need to trim anywhere, fits great. 100% recommended."
5,delonghi heater,We have purchased four of these heaters over the past 3 years. They are energy efficient and quickly warm the room. We don't need to use our furnace unless it gets below 20 degrees.
2,Would not buy this,"Nice-looking product, but faulty and no longer supported. Bought two of these in the fall, used reasonably regularly throughout the winter, both worked well in closed and open spaces. First one died about a month ago - light still worked, made normal clicking noise when turning the lower heat knob to higher setting, but didn't heat. No way to repair; in addition, Delonghi has stopped making these and will only offer to replace with a much less expensive model (TCH8590ER). Second unit still working but emits blue sparks at times (typically when on a medium heat setting); there may be bigger issues with this type of flat-panel heating that has caused Delonghi to discontinue."
5,Powerful Delonghi Radiator,I was really amazed at how much heat the radiator puts out. I have down in my open basement. It heated up almost the whole immediate area I had it sitting at in the basement. I highly recommend this heater.
4,Works great,"This heater is quiet and warms the room nicely.It would be better if it had a digital temperature setting. Also, I do not like the fact that the unit light remains on even if the settings are turned to the lowest/off. I have been unplugging the unit when it's not in use.Overall, the best space heater I've used."
1,Sparks,"I bought this heater in February 2009, based largely on CU's high ratings and good user reviews here. I used it seasonally for a few hours a day, 4 or 5 days a week, until now (early April 2012). Yesterday, after an hour or so of use, I heard odd crackling noises and thought I noticed a spark and an odor, so I turned it off and unplugged it. Today, large orange sparks appeared as soon as I turned it on and traveled around on the face of the heater (presumably on the elements), accompanied by the same noises and odor. I don't plan to turn it on again as I strongly suspect it is now a fire hazard.I debated giving it two stars, since it worked adequately for the equivalent of two winter seasons, but I don't think an item like this should fail so quickly under reasonable use, and I am certain that it shouldn't fail in such an alarming way. I can't recommend that anyone buy it."
1,Lasted only 3 months,"Nice looks, even heat, nice product if it only lasted longer then 3 months. I used it for 3 months on\off and turned it on for the 2nd heating season this Oct. I woke up to my new born crying and saw a small fizzle inside which scared me at first. I thought it was going to light up. But instead it never worked again after that."
4,"Works Great on the wall, alright on the floor","First this is not like your typically heater blowing out air. It doesn't work that well for quick heating you or as a localized heater. We have had great success with them maintaining room temperature though in the winter.We mount them to the walls (unfortunately as noted by other the screen is hot so it needs to be beyond a toddler's reach) and find that the room is typically well maintained. If you are looking for something to keep you warm as your in a particular large cold room ... you have to stay pretty close and it really isn't good for that purpose. We have found the infrared heaters work good for localized where this great for rooms.The legs are extremely light so it is easy to knock over, although honestly none have ever broken from it and instead of moving from room-to-room we ended up buying more for this reason."
5,Excellent little heater,"Got this heater a few days ago, and it's been great to have during the minus-Zero degree tempertures we're having in Chicago. I'm using this little heater to warm a 500 square foot studio apartment with an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling windows on the 35th floor of a Chicago skyscraper (Goldberg's famed 'Marina Towers').My only complaint was that one of the holes for attaching the stand/wheels seemed to be missing threads and so the attaching screw would not snug up tight. Since this heater adapts itself so easliy to wall-mounting, and comes with all the hardware needed to do that, this little hottie will be going onto the wall later this week.Most surprising was the weight--it seems to weigh less than a 5-pound bag of sugar (or a volume of anything written by Tolstoy). :-)"
2,Worked for 1 year,Worked for one heating season. Second season started sparking and burning. Died 1 year and a week after purchase. Warranty is 1 year. Several other users have the same complaint. I recommend a more reliable technology.
4,BEST HEATER FOR THE MONEY,I purchased this heater after reviewing several heaters on the market. After reading consumer reports and seeing their review of this heater I decided to try it. This is a very good heater and will heat a room very well and is also a safe built heater with several safety features built in. It is very portable as it has casters and weighs very little so most anyone can move it very easily.I also purchased another heater which is a baseboard heater at the same time I purchased this one. The baseboard heater has a digital readout and can be set very easily but it is very hard to tell if the heat is radiating as it travels straight up.I would recommend this HHP1500 over any other I have reviewed.
4,Innovative heater,"Very light weight and will hang on the wall like a picture frame. Generates plenty of heat. The first few times it did smell funny from factory residue but that seems to have subsided over time.Frame is platicky and kind of cheap feeling but as long as you don't abuse it, it should hold up."
5,It's Great,"Pros- It's quiet, it radiates heat instead of blowing it, it heats air by convection so the warm air circulates.Cons- Our electric bill went up.We enjoy watching a movie in the warm family room without having to heat the whole house."
2,Disappointing,It was good while it worked (for about a year). It stopped working after I heard a sizzling sound and smelled something burning.
2,"Worked great for a year, then broke","This heater hangs on the wall, out of the reach of children and heated my not-very-well insulated room. After a year and two weeks (the warranty lasts one year), it just stopped heating up, although the pilot light continued to turn on. DeLonghi agreed to send me another heater, but they don't make this model anymore (although I see some sellers still have them in stock) and I have to pay $15 for them to ship the new one to me. I'm going to take them up on their offer, and I'm getting an oil-filled heater instead, but it obviously doesn't hang on the wall. I say this heater is good if you are okay just using it for one year."
4,Amazing Heating Capability,"This heater really is very safe. It is cool less than a half inch from the back surface of the heater, making it wall mountable using the hardware provided. We really like this feature because we have small children that would easily touch or fall into a normal ground based heater.The only problem we had with the heater is that the amazon information said it could be in an area around water and splashes were not a problem and the documentation that came with the heater said otherwise. We are using the heater up on a wall in our bathroom further from the tub/shower area that initially planned.Great purchase! No regrets!"
1,"Stops Working after One Year, Poor Customer Support","This unit stopped working after one year. Even when it was working, it through sparks on start up, making it of questionable safety: I was reluctant to leave it on at night or unattended. DeLonghi will not replace it if it is over one year old, and any repair would cost more than the unit itself. If you have bought this unit, I would recommend returning it before the warranty ends. Delonghi is well aware of the reliability issues with this heater."
2,Looks Better Than It Works,"I live in a 1250 sq. ft. open loft space with only a gas fireplace for heat. Upstairs in the loft office I needed auxiliary heat. What I liked about this unit was its looks and its wheels -- it just rolls around the floor quite easily. Unfortunately, the heat it puts out doesn't seem to reach very far from the source. You can feel the heat with your hand a few inches from the panel, but my desk chair is only 3 or 4 ft. away, with the unit behind me, and my back and shoulders are still quite chilled. I'm guessing that the absence of a fan or any radiant elements limits this unit's effectiveness. Bottom line: I'm still cold."
1,"Flimsy Construction, quit working after 6 months...","Flimsy and poor construction and low quality overall. Worked good while it worked, but all of a sudden (having owned for about 6 months) it simply quit working."
3,An informative and reasonably well writen book.,"Even though the author says in the beginning that he was rejected by his subject for an authorised biography,he still manages to write an interesting,informative and esoteric piece of work.I think this book will only be worthwhile to someone who is already a fan and is familiar with his discography.It gave some light as to how E.C.'s career has taken so many turns and how he became influenced by so many musical genres.It also became clear that he would'nt be the artist that he is today if he had'nt been some what of a maverick in the music industry.This of course is further supported by ups and downs of his personal life that was often reflected in his music.Overall,the book was tastefully writen and will again,be of interest primarily to fans of E.C. and not to people unfamilar with his work as there are reletively few sensational and trashy stories to entertain the voyeuristic and curious public."
2,Did it chart? Did it chart?,"Because of Costello's fantastic music and lyrics, not so much because of the mans life(of which I knew nothing about), I wanted to read this book, and so I have.Well, I must say that while Costello's lyrics are profound and rich, the book about him do not fit that description. I was all the way through reading the book with great interest and fascination, but that was never because I found the book well written or in any way brilliant. Anyway, I couldn't put it away because the story told was about an exciting human being.This is on the other hand no excuse to write a boring book, that uses more energy on explaining marketing strategies and US charts, than contemplating Elvis Costello."
5,Amazing,Really good protagonist and writing subject! Definitely a book to.keep.on the shelf of.any library! Jesus is shown from a whole new perspective
1,I HATE IT!!!!!!!,"if i were you i would not read this. this is extremely boring and hard to follow. DO NOT BUY THIS. If you want a good book by ths author, i sugjust the sign of the beaver"
5,uplifts the young and the old.,"In my attempt to read all the Newberry Award winners I had put off reading The Bronze Bow. In fact it wasn't until I had read a few pages that I become throughly involved in the story of Daniel. I feel this book has much to give to readers of all ages. The messages of faith and endurance speak to all. I felt the writing and plot lines drew in the reader and made you feel like you were on the mountain with Daniel. The one thing I feared was that it would be a litle preachy, but Jesus was so human in this book that you could really concentrate on the messages that he was teaching. I recommend this book to those who want to feel their spirits lift with every turning of the page"
5,YES!,This is a great older movie and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Excellent quality too. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit!
1,Very Disappointed,The picture was VERY bad in places and mediocre overall. My old VHS had a better picture.Wish I hadn't given the VHS away before viewing this DVD.
2,Callas is overrated,"Only diehard Callas enthusiasts and those who already know the work well should consider buying this CD. To begin with, the opera is sung in Italian-when Gluck actually made a point of writing it in French! In addition, the male singers are all woefully inadequate, and Sonzogno's Gluck sounds more like bad Puccini. As usual with Callas, there are thrilling moments (for instance, the wonderful opening scene), but they never add up to a complete portrayal, and, although she sings with great elegance and poise, the overall peformance is disappointing. Those who wish to hear what wonders she could accomplish in Gluck should listen to her Alceste, which is another matter altogether."
3,"Too Expensive, Too long to Load!","This game is a rip off! I got this game expecting a wonderful Tycoon, but got a game that takes 3 minutes to load! When I tied a Sandbox, with $200,000 in cash, I ran out very quickly! I'm not BANKRUPT, but almost, only after 30 minutes of playing! BIG rip off!!!!!!!!!"
4,Strong but slim armguard,"The arm guard is nicely sewn with leath top and a soft underside for your arm. It does come off as slightly thin, but good for most forearms."
2,bleh,"Considering that this is 12 bucks and that the cool ""real"" leather ones with nice straps start at around 15 bucks, there is no reason to buy this. It is a little plastic toy armguard with awkward squares of velcro. For 3 dollars more you can get a real one that won't look silly on a grown up. This should be called a ""youth"" armguard."
2,I need a legit one.,"That wouldn't happen to be this one. It's way too small for my arm, and barely protects it. I would rather not use it than use it at all."
2,yu get what you pay for,made cheap and flimsy I would go to a hunting hobby shop to get a better fit. Made for a very small arm
3,"Worthwhile, but misleading","Time hasn't really done this book many favors. It concentrates heavily on Sihanouk and his activities after World War II and the events leading up to the Khmer Rouge's power. Lon Nol seems to be given a fair shake, but no doubt at the time this book was written, information about what happened during the Khmer Rouge period must have been very scarce, as the facts here are hard to come by. The ripples of the Khmer Rouge had not completely played out by the time it was published either, as Pol Pot was still living.For details of Sihanouk's personality and motivations, this is a pretty decent read. If you are looking for a serious examination of the Khmer Rouge period or beyond, you're going to be disappointed with this one."
4,Very good but not the best,"This is an intelligent and elegant rendition of some of Dowland's most popular songs. The voice is lucid, the phrasing appropriate. Yet, the impact is not anywhere near the singing of Paul Agnew in this repertory. Just trust me, listen to sound clips, go to the store and ask to listen to a few tracks - and see for yourself. Agnew (not Daniels, not Scholl, not Chance) is the man for English medieval songs."
1,Simply frustrating,"As a beginning knitter, I found this kit completely frustrating. While the kit has lots of great projects and is nicely packaged, the instructions are nothing less than awful. The written instructions are vague and don't even correspond to the accompanying photos. (The knitter in the photo is usually several steps ahead of you, so it's impossible to tell how your own needles and yarn should be arranged.) Incredibly aggravating."
2,A big pain,"I've had nothing but trouble with the CM 9537 controller.Many times its stopped working, especially after not beingused for several days. Pulling out the power transformerand powering back helped at first, but now after 3 years oflittle use, it looks to be dead although the box goes thrusyncs and all as if it where working perfectly. For awhile there I didn't think to see if the antenna wasrotating ,turns out it wasn't, but the 9537 appear to workperfectly. I was searching for another cm 9537 if price wasreasonable, but after reading reviews here, I guess I'llhave to redo everything."
3,im mad the math test was really hard and your book did not c,this book sayed it would cover what it needed to/and it dident the math test was nothing like what you were teaching me so im real disapointed i felt i need to buy more books on the subject thank god i passed because math is one of my strong suject.so if you get a chance to see the real test i would rewrite the math section just to help some of the other people who need more help then i did but thank you for making the book for people like me who want to better them self
4,Very nice!,"I got an advance copy of this DVD and was very pleased with it. Overall the story is good. There are enough twist and turns to keep it interesting. It seems that everyone in this story has some kind of skeleton in their closet and that the murder of a local call girl is causing the skeletons to come out dancing! The DVD has some nice features that are not expected on most films of this caliber.I found the directors commentary interesting to listen to, these guys sound like they have put a lot of thought into their film. Also the DVD contains a music video and a sit down interview with the director, producer and the editor.This is a great rental but I would own it as well. The story gets better after multiple viewings because you are always realizing some new detail."
2,Hardly cutting edge!,"This book is more of a guide for those wishing to conduct business and live in Burma (Myanmar) than it is for the average tourist. However, even for the business traveler, most of the recommendations are at best generalized, if not downright vague. Where this book succeeds is in the explanation of the basic customs and nature of the Burmese native."
3,"The Cup-Entertaining, simple","If you are a horse lover, most of the time it doesn't really matter what the story is. The images of the horses are enough. That's true of this movie. The fact that it is based on a true story helps cover some of the weak spots in the story structure. When there is an evening with nothing on TV and nothing to do, this movie will entertain you. It is not one I would see twice, but it successfully filled an evening.The Cup"
1,Free but still DRM-protected. That seems to make no sense.,"Thank you for offering this book for free.I would wish the offer to be DRM free as well, since I see no sense in makinga free product less usable for the customer.In fact the only effect I can see, is that you alienate the customer, since you make itdifficult to use the book with various Software like e.g. the Calibre Book Library.Most other free Kindle books which I found were DRM free, which made me quite happy."
3,"Well-written, but slightly painful to read","I've read several of Ms. Hunt's books. The main relationship in this book is rather painful to ""witness"" through most of the book. There is also plenty of death and destruction involving the characters (probably historically accurate for the time period--but slightly depressing). The overall writing is good--but don't expect to feel good through most of the book."
3,it was good for a while.......,"Ok I've had mine for about 3 years, and I just bought a yamaha ypg-625, because I'm tired of this thing. The sounds are all pretty good, the grand piano sound is alright, the guitar sounds could be a lot better. I like the beats it comes with. The main problem I have with my keyboard is about 6 months ago it went stupid on me. I can no longer record songs on it, when I try to go to the song memory feature it stops working. The display gets messed up, no buttons work, it takes me forever to get it back working again. I suppose its a pretty good keyboard for the price but hopefully yamaha will provide me with something that will last more than a couple years."
4,Good Start,"This is a good reading for someone with no Futures & Options knowledge. I find it quite useful how the author clearly defines various swaps namely-- Currency, Interest Rates and Energy. However, this book would not cover newer Derivs stuff i.e. Credit Derivatives (though it provides a simple snapshot of CDS and TRS). I commend the author for not taking the GEEK approach."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this feeder for my mom for Mother's Day. My parents live in a very heavily bird populated area. They were excited and filled the feeder immediately. Well, it has been almost 5 months and the feeder is still full! They haven't seen one single bird go to the feeder. Save your money and buy something else!!"
5,Great learning tool,"and fun to boot. The literal translations of the proverbs make this book very useful for building your Persian vocabulary. I've learned literally hundreds of new words making my way through this book. I also appreciate the concise but information-packed footnotes.My only request if Ms. Habibian ever does another edition would be for a little more vowelling or transliteration, especially for the more unusual words. That would make this book an even better learning tool."
3,A Reviewer Who is NOT a Member of the Author's Poker Pals,"Not sure what I'm missing. These books are thin in more than the physical way. This one has a few decent ideas. Actually, my big beefs with this book are:1. Most of this information is just freely available. Look at this as a search prevention mechanism.2. If you use a tool with great CVS support (like Eclipse 3), literally 2/3 of the book is completely superfluous.3. If you don't use a tool w/great support, get that for free, not this, you'll end up much farther down the road.Why not put ideas into a book like this? For instance, Vincent Massol's recent article about automating a process of publishing diffs to keep people up to date. Or looking at some of the many interesting OS addons like CVSList. This is literally just one more book that sells you something you already have ready access to."
5,Where Two or More are Gathered:,"This was a very emotional book for me to read as it was connected to a part of my own past. I cried , and I laughed. Even though I don't agree with alot of things that were said in the book. I did feel the writers truth in what she wrote as I too lived in that long ago place in Marietta, Georgia."
2,Pretty but useless against squirrels,"I have actually bought 2 of these feeders for my mom who loves to feed her birds.The first one I bought many years ago and it did okay for a while until the squirrels figured out that they could chew through the bars holding the glass, which would cause the glass to shatter on the patio and leave a big gaping hole into the feeder.The 2nd one did even last 2 months after purchase. The build quality was definitely shabbier than the first one with the bars being made of softer metal. It was no match for the squirrels. I definitely would not purchase another given the ""bionic"" feats of my mom's squirrels."
1,bogus,"this sucks anticapated the whole set from each presentatio both disc of mr.perfect, 3 of wcw & 3 of dusty say it right away along with product name what the would be recieving instead of misleading them,"
2,Not what I expected,"This feeder was a huge disappointment. The cover is hard to attach. It take several tries to get the grooves and grippers to match, especially when its no longer new. Lots of seeds spill in the process. After just a few months the color of the plastic (the entire thing is plastic) started to fade. The cover has warped a bit making it even harder to close securely that before.The ring to hang it from is short so it's difficult to hang unless you add chain. The bottom serves as a perch and is very narrow and is part of the base- no drainage holes. Rain collects in it, the seeds get all wet and stick together and rot. Water gets into the storage area and the seeds in there clump so they don't come out for the birds. Then they rot and /or sprout. I have to take it down and clean it out each time it rains.Squirrels love it. Birds and owners, not so much. I would not buy it another and do not recommend it at all."
3,Just okay,"I guess your get what you pay for. Kind of cheaply made, and low capacity. I doubt the birds care,however."
2,Cheap plastic,"Don't get me wrong U get what U pay for.However, it's to bad it wasn't thicker plastic or even copper or some other metal..Just losses something in its construction."
5,you should read this book,This book is really good because Its about a son of a great Ashanti chief who is captured and sold to be a slave and its about how he tries to get back to his people and he meets 1 american slave called Joseph and another kid who is a british bound servant called Tim.The coolest part is when Kofi learns how to speak english because he can understand people and not make everybody frustrated.The worst part is when Kofi gts taken away to be a slave because he looses his freedom and can't do anything but work.
5,Great for puppy owners of all levels,"This toolkit contains information on housetraining, socialization and training, as well as fun games you can play with your puppy to increase obedience reliability. All training exercises use positive reinforcement methods, as well as information on how to manage your puppy's environment to prevent problems, reducing if not eliminating the need for punishment.The developmental chart allows owners to see the training and socialization priorities for their puppy at each stage of development.I highly recommend for any puppy owner. Makes a great gift!"
4,Great aid to praying the Mass,"Wonderful book to help you follow along during Mass, especially if your a visual person. If you miss a daily Mass you can always see the readings in your Missal when you have the time. Only problem I have is the translations of the scriptures are a little different then those at Mass so it makes it a little awkward to follow along, but overall a great buy!"
5,All The More Reason To Look for Pirated Copies!,"WTF? Greed is the problem here. Ever since the problems associated with Napster, the recording industry has become greedy buttheads.As you can see, so many are ready to put out their cash to buy the show DVD's, but you won't because you want MORE money.Jeeezzzz.Untill then, Just Google Malcolm In The Middle DVD's and you can buy decent quality DVD's recorded from TV untill they release official copies.This time, Fox and recording industry..... It's YOUR fault."
4,In Search of Noah's Ark,"This documentary film was released in 1977. Since than, a lot has changed in the field of Ark research.However, the film covers the history of Ark research up until 1976 and this is the best aspect of the film. Some of the conclusions reached are a bit premature as they lack concrete evidence. For example, when the narrator states,""Since we have proven that the Bible is an accurate account of history,..."" withoutreally providing the evidence is the films weakest point.I still recommend the film as it provides a lot of background information on the Ark itself."
4,The same but different,"With a format largely unchanged for its 59 editions, this series is valuable but recently in danger of becoming a bit staid. However Adam Keen (Ed.) has injected a sharp opinionated eye and a nack for plot summaries that makes this an easy and stimulating read. There are movies listed that won't make it to these (or many other) shores, but that's part of the fun.There are some minor quibbles. Two of the photographs are mis-labelled; and colour photographs would be an improvement. Those aside, an entertaining read that is thought-provoking at the same time. A valuable reference for 2003, especially for collectors."
5,love it,"i like it unique color! add more color in my kitchen!I don't like due to small storage place in my kitchen ...but overall, I love it for prepare soup, stew...."
1,Amazing Grace,"I ordered the wrong item. I was thinking that it was a DVD for viewing , but instead it was a musical from the movie. I returned the item"
1,Huge gaps in the research - many errors!,"Clearly, this quickly produced book is simply cashing in on your interest in Panama and piggybacking on legitimate promotion of the country. It is apparent that the author invested as little time and money as possible in researching it. Although this book is published and copyright in 2005, in many cases, the research is at least three years out of date, and, in some cases, up to five years out of date."
1,What a nut!!,The Left Behind series is a fictional account. If you want to know the non-fictional account given to one of God's own read the Bible. The writer of this book makes up her own material.
3,Has good qualities and bad qualities,"My husband hates this item, he roasts and says that his shoulder bothers him when he sleeps on the foam. So, I double it over but then I am sleeping many inches higher than him. I love this item, and it doesn't make me get overheated like him. The doubling over makes me feel like I am sleeping on a cloud. Having it flat wasn't enough foam for my hips at 5.5 inches, but at 11 it is great. So his loss is my gain."
4,GOOD STUFF!,"Yes the material smells when you first take it out of the package but let it air for a few hours and it is fine.....Forget their protector cover, get something worthwhile! Go to Bed Bath and Beyond, in store or online, and get their 250 count mattress pad with 20 in deep pockets. The two make a great combination as the foam doesnt slip around. The foam comes compressed and at first I thought I had gotten the 2"" instead of the 3"" but as it released it is three inches. (It would be nice if they put something in the box showing what was actually shipped so you dont think you were sent the wrong stuff.) I made the mistake of ""trying it out"" once on the bed and really messed up. It was so comfortable I fell asleep and was almost late for work. I checked around and think this is probably the best of the foams available in its price range because it is the 5.5 density. The free shipping at the price is good too."
1,Piece of junk!,"I read people's review and thought it was a good product before I made my decision. Got my package yesterday. When I opened it, it's a piece of junk! How this paper thin wrap can protect your knees is beyond my imagination. If you have knees problem, don't buy this. Get a real, heavy duty one."
1,After just a couple months it fell apart.,"The stitching on the back absolutely unravelled after about two months of occasional use. I took very good care of it, washed it in a cold gentle cycle, maybe mine was defective, but it is useless now. I checked the description and it doesn't look like they eve have a guarantee. Buyer beware."
3,Watch sizing,Seems to be of good quality. Their XXL is comparable in size to most companies XL and as someone else posted there isn't any measurable difference between L and XL.
2,Runs VERY small,"The XXL is supposed to fit knees 19-22 inches. I bought it for my husband's 20"" knee and this thing is so small he can't even get it on! It fits perfectly on my 16"" knee.If your knee is more than 16"" or if you have large legs, forget this product."
2,"Runs small, Order a size up","This knee brace is made from good quality materials and looks well made, but my fiance had the hardest time slipping it on. We measured the circumference of his knee and it fell into the XLarge category, which was expected since he usually purchases things in that size. He managed to get it on, but it was far too tight. Definitely runs small so I suggest ordering a size up."
4,Great Picks,"My kids love this DVD, the only complaint I have is that the 5 different stories don't play continuously, we have to play each one separately"
4,So many songs- so many old friends,"I totally agree that Restless Heart sounds like Little Texas. Too funny...but I have always found I confuse their music.Anywho....this is a great compilation CD. Restless Heart has some great tunes on here that I had totally forgotten about. From the hit That Rock won't roll- which just makes you want to dance, to the most touching of songs like Long Lost Friend with the sharp piercings sounds of heartbreak. Dancy's Dream has always been a favorite of almost anyone who is a RH fan, and it includes the sweet I'll still be loving you.There are a whopping 16 songs on the CD with very little filler. There were songs here i never realized belonged to them, or had forgotten all together- like Why does it have to be wrong or right....what a fun song!"
5,The Best of the best country band,"This CD by far has the best of what is my opinion the best country band ever. From ""Back To The Heartbreak Kid"" to ""Tell Me What You Dream"", it includes all of there best except for some reason ""Wheels"" is omitted. The three new tracks on this CD are great in themselves, showing the harmonizing that made this band great. One band that is truly missed by me. A must for any country music fan."
5,"Yes, Cankermelts Do Work","I dreaded every time I had a canker sore coming on. My canker sores typically lasted for 2 1/2 weeks before being fully healed with severe pain from days 4 to 10. I tried cankermelts with much skepticism and they shortened the duration to about 5 days. If I catch one early enough, cankermelts can shorten the duration to 2 days. I apply one just before I go to bed so that I don't move it around - they need to stay put for hours."
4,Such memories...,"I was delighted to find this book on Amazon. This used to be a favorite book of mine. My Mom and I would go the library and every week, I checked this book out. We used to read it together all the time. I credit those outings and, partially, this book with my appetite for literature. I bought two copies (one for Mom and one for me!) and I could not be more happy! Thank you!"
3,Probably the worst Figgs CD but not terrible; get their new live CD instead!,"I love everything these guys do and it's sad that inferior bands like Coldplay, Radiohead, and just about everyone else are making millions while these guys play to a cult. This CD is probably their weakest production and songwriting wise, and when I first heard it, I thought it was the end of the road.Fortunately, they rebounded with the double album Palais which is their best record ever.After you get Palais, go on their website and get Continue To Enjoy The Figgs, Vol 1, which is a live record recorded in guitarist Mike Gent's basement and has lively versions of several songs off of the last few records played in front of true fans. Enjoy!"
4,The ozone is gone- so is freedom,"In this fun Berkley sci-fi series, the year is 2035 and Texas was devastated by earthquakes, toxic waste, and cybernetic outlaws. Protecting the peace is Alamo Smith- the last Texas Ranger. In his second adventure of the series the reader will find themself between an army of criminal cyborgs and the blazing high tech sidearm of Alamo Smith. Don't forget to duck!"
2,Not quite what i expected,"I grew up in northern California, and i was expecting much for detail. Knowing what i know about my area, the maps were severely lacking. I assume this applies to many of the other areas in the book that I know less about.It had some very general observations that might be useful for the casual history buff, but if your going out prospecting with your GPS and a pan, save your money for either real maps or lunch. This book will not help the local prospector with even the basic knowledge."
1,MORE LIES FROM LINDSEY ...,"People, ole Hal Lindsey predicted the world would end in the early 80's in ""Late Great Planet Earth,"" did it? How many more times has he predicted it since then? has it? Where ole Hal is conscerned meditate on Matt 7:21-22, Mark 13:22,1 John 4:1 etc. This is a teaching popular among Evangelical Protestants and asserts that Christians will be miraculaously delivered from the tribulation and that only the ""unsaved"" will suffer under the rule of the Antichrist. The idea that Christians will be ""raptured""-that is, taken up into heaven-before the tribulation is an invention of the ninteenth century. No one in the previous 1800 yrs. of Christian history ever came up with such a notion...Anyone that likes a book like this needs to read (Matthew 25:13)"
5,I love this labeler,"I like the paper labels to label paper and cardboard items and the plastic labels to label hard-surfaced items. They stay on well. Yet they are easy to peel off, especially the plastic ones.The tape is self-threading. To change tapes, just open the hinged cover, pull out one cartridge, and pop in another. I keep a spare cartridge of each type handy.The device leaves an automatic margin on each end of the text. If it is more margin than you want, it is easy to shorten the ends with scissors.It is very easy to peel the backing off the tape because it is precut lengthwise. Peel off one half from the center and then peel off the other half.The labels, even the metallic ones, cannot survive a hot flame. (Don't even ask.)The manual is short, and definitely worth reading.The product is much more than I bargained for. I highly recommend it."
2,Works Great for a while THEN DISPLAY FAILS,"I've had this item (DYMO LetraTag Personal Label Maker 11944 Silver) for almost two years. When I first got it I was happy. It worked as advertised. I didn't use it much. Mostly it sat in the drawer. It looks like new, but the display has failed to the point that I can not read it. THAT SUCKS! It still prints labels fine, but I can not see what I'm typing until I read it on the printed label. Reading Amazon reviews, I see that this is a fairly common problem with this model. I would NOT recommend this item."
1,Huh????,"I grew up in the Mormon church, graduated from a Mormon college and have since chosen a different path and different religion for myself. The people who wrote this book obviously werent immersed in it like I was. They have some facts right, but on the whole are waaaayyy off base. I was happy to leave this church in the dust, but it was definitely not as negative as the authors portray it to be. If anyone wants a true picture of the Mormon church they should not read Godmakers."
4,God Maker review,Rec'd the book promptly and in great condition - haven't had a chance to read book yet so can't give review on book yet....
2,One Narrow Dogma for Another,"Mostly accurate, but not neutral. The God Makers details some of the problematic history of Mormonism and its leaders but fails to engage this reader. An alternative agenda is in play. Traditional Christianity and common biblical interpretations are subtly (or not so) promoted and while I appreciate each author's right to an agenda, I am not inspired by one narrow dogma over another. Mormonism may be more narrow, but it's all a house of cards. Authorial credibility is lost when a card is removed and the author attempts to keep the rest of the house standing. It insults the reader's intelligence. Not impressed."
1,One star is too much,The writer of this book Ed Decker was excommunicated from the LDS church not once but twice for adultry. Do you think he has a motive?
1,False Information,"I have a simple statement about this book. It is very much false information. Just remember one thing, if you have a problem with a Chevy truck you do not take it to a Ford dealer to get it fixed, you would go to a Chevy dealer. So if you have questions about the Mormons, then go to a mormon. They will be honest with you about everything they do. One more thing, they are true believers in Christ, they believe Christ died on the cross for their sins also and they also believe that Christ is the living son of the eternal father. God lives and so does his son Christ."
4,Yet Another Good Critique of Mormon Theology,"The list of books that debunk Mormon theology continues to grow. This books has in common with a number of others such as Mormonism 101 and Shadow or Reality a distinct ""Christian"" ring to it. The analysis is good, and a few of the points made are original to this book.My only reservations have to do with its breathless style and the approach that Christianity must be judged by the gloss that has been put on it by more traditional Christian theologians. A more rational conclusion would be that the various Christian sects have each put their own ""spin"" on the New Testament teachings of Christ.In short, this book is yet another good example of how easy it is to demonstrate inadequacies in Mormon ""theology."" It may or may not convince you of the superiority of the various alternative ""Christian"" views that abound."
2,This book made me wet my pants - with laughter!,"Are you looking for one of the craziest, out of whack books on any religious topic? Then you found the right book. Written by a former member trying to make his former faith look good, this author goes so far overboard one would have to be clinically insane to believe it - or to believe the religion found in it. I found my self crying at points I was laughing so hard at the insane ideas portrayed by this book. One has to admit, the author did a great job of creating a new religion. However, the one talked about in this book is more like Scientology (in that it is unbelievably insane) than ""Mormonism."""
3,Not perfect,"I've watched the Ring cycle live in the Metropolitan Opera in this very same production. To be frank, the Met's Ring cycle isn't one of its best productions - it's rather blandly directed and there're a few weak links in the cast, including some in the major roles.Having now watched this DVD transcription, my impression remains largely the same. One of course misses on the TV screen the grandeur of the opera house, however, one can become more attentive to the details. Yet, on the whole, both the staging and the direction are still rather unimaginative. The cast that the Met has assembled isn't to notch, and they're not particularly good in acting, too.The production is worth watching. But one shouldn't place high expectations on it. And also prepared some a few stretches of boring drama and disappointing direction on the way."
2,Unevenly cast in a tepid interpretation,"Frankly, I had high hopes for this set before it was released, because I very much prefer a traditional staging of Wagner's great work than those gimmicky productions that we're now accustomed in the opera house.Unfortunately, this set does not live up to expectations. One of the major reasons is that the performances captured here have been very unevely cast. Some of the singers are distinctly below their best and some (like Behrens's Brunnhilde) shouldn't have been singing their roles at all.Another reason for my disappointment arises from the conducting of Levine, which I found to be lethargic and dramatically stunted. The orchestra performed very well, though. But as an interpretation, it lacks fire and drama.The production loses much of its grandeur when viewed through a home TV (unless one has a very large and wide-screen TV set), and the stage direction is merely dutiful. Some of the stage effects are also too much subdued.I'll award this set 2 stars."
1,terrible,i love goosebumps and they alway excite me and thrill me but this one just did the same thing over and over again and I think you should buy a different goosebumps
3,"C'mon, it wasn't THAT bad!","Yes, this book may have had some common sense ideas in it, but I thought a lot of it was interesting. I thought it was helpful about how to plan your wedding date and some of the ways to save money on invitations, catering, music, etc...My reasoning for only giving three stars as to four or five was that some of it was a little far-fetched and ridiculous. But, I enjoyed it. I also liked some of the brides' personal stories and ideas."
5,Coolest music ever recorded,"Dean Martin had style, confidence and incredible charisma. Add his laid-back velvet vocals and you have the ultimate easy listening CD with this compilation of the best of his years at Capitil and Reprise. All the classics are included here - Everybody Loves Somebody, Return To Me, You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You - and in my opinion, his greatest recording - Ain't That A Kick In The Head. This CD is perfect to unwind with after a hard day at work - kick off your shoes, sit back and relax!"
3,WHAT IS THIS?,"I stumbled into this mess by accident. It might not be so bad if the singer wasn't contantly drunk. The song ""Valerie"" is pretty good. He couldn't even spell it right. Yes mommy, my homework IS done!"
2,You Can Do Better,"Like Elvis and Sinatra, there's simply too many Dean Martin compilations out there - making for a difficult task of separating the wheat from the chaffe.King of Cool is ok, I guess, but nothing really separates this ""Best Of"" from the Pack. Frankly, the recently-released ""Dino: The Essential Dean Martin"" looks a lot more promising. 30 songs - almost double the number of tracks on King of Cool - for under $14. Or, buy it from a seller on Amazon for even less. You can't go wrong.As for King of Cool - it doesn't even appear to be in production anymore. Not a major loss."
3,"It is designed for kids, but","I think it is helpful. There are so many things to know to start cello, having someone demonstrate the basics is helpful."
1,Dreadful,"I enjoyed Reich's previous books, but this one was just awful. Adjectives that come to mind are implausible, convoluted, lazy, and predictable. The book was so bad that I can't justify to myself spending the time to write a longer critique. I stuck with the book until I had about 20 pages left and then just quickly flipped through the predictable ending."
5,The Patriot's Club,Christopher has entwined the characters very skillfully making The Patriot's Club suspenseful all the way to the end! What transpires in this story could easily happen in real life. Excellent read!
5,"Thoroughly done research, mixed with a compelling story","This story was written by Guillou in an attempt to show the Swedish people the real truth of the last years of the Cold War, as well as writing a good novel. I agree that Carl Hamilton is very like James Bond in his appearance, but Hamilton is trained for field missions, while Bond was just a charming fellow who happened to have the right training for the right missions, and be in the right place in the right time. After freeing a hostage in Beirut, and trying to hide his part in a plan to destroy Russian underground bases on Swedish territory, Hamilton must protect his innocence against the Swedish people while seeking out Stig Sandström, a Russian double agent, and trying to solve a series of unsolved cases of murder at Swedish conscripts."
4,The shorts are better than the movie,"We liked this, but we preferred the action of the shorter cartoon Yogi. The picture and sound are good, the story is just a little slower than the shorts."
2,Very disappointed.....,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about the conditions of women during the period the book addresses. I also expected an informed commentary througout. This book actually looks like someone just decided to re-publish what amounts to an ""I am truly sorry and I humbly repent"" style rant on the evils of prostitution. After a cursory and inconclusive forward, the editor (Sharon Wood) never gives any helpful perspective again. Again, this book was meant for the public, and was meant to ""edify"". It contains very little true biography."
1,Not What it Seems,"Unlike Sharon Wood, I suspect this book was written by an abolitionist, not a former prostitute. However, it is an interesting account of the attitudes about prostitution at the time, and the conflicts between reglementation and abolition."
2,Handy labelmaker but the labels don't stick well at all,"This is a really slick, handy-to-use labelmaker that I love to use but the label themselves don't stay stuck very well ... in fact the metal labels curl up after about 10 minutes on most surfaces. The paper is a little better but not much."
3,Good for a while,"I was happy with it while it worked. I bought this a few years ago, ran out of tape, stuck it in a corner of my desk for maybe a month or so, and, when I tried using it again, found that the labels didn't print because the ink had dried up. There doesn't seem to be an option to just replace the ink cartridge, which makes my very useful label maker into a clunky piece of plastic. The warranty only covers it for 1 year. While the labels and keyboard worked just fine for me, I have mixed feelings about buying this product again, especially as the tape cartridges are so expensive and there's no way to fix the ink problem."
2,STINKY!,Omg this is the smelliest stuff ever. It smells like an old lady and its so strong. Ugh! I like the products performance but I would never buy it again because of the hideous smell.
3,love the product....not the container,This item did not arrive as advertised in the photo. The product came in a jar instead of as pictured in a tube.
5,Great for Dry Skin!,"This is an excellent product for dealing with dry skin. I tend to get really dry skin on my hands and feet, especially in the winter. You put this cream on at bedtime and it works wonderfully. Helps prevent dry skin from getting to that extreme point where you have to worry about cracking and soreness."
5,Great way to buy Mary Kay Night Cream,"This a fast, easy, and economical way to purchase Mary Kay Night Cream. Great price, service, and fast delivery. I would recommend this product to everyone, my wife loves it."
5,A must for temperate area gardeners,"I haven't started receiving this magazine, but I know it well from frequent trips to England. I so look forward to my first issue and am so pleased that the Amazon price is so very reasonable!!!"
4,Treue Wagner,"Being a Wagner fan and seeing procudtions in Munich I enjoyed this version. The problem to is, whre are the anviles as Wagner scored it in Scene 2, sorry not there. Also where were the Harps in scene 4. As for James Levine I have to be honest in my estimation that he is not a great Wagnerian Intterpreter of Wagner. I did like the staging as it was more what Wagner had in mind, that ws good to see. If you are a real traditional Wagner person I recommend this DVD and if you like the modern person this is NOT for you."
3,Play it with your own CD soundtrack!,Some beautiful nature shots ruined by overuse of time lapse photography. Waterfalls and streams are ruined by speeding them up to frenetic pace. Also the narration and soundtrack is horrible but that is easily fixed by playing your own CD's as a background.
1,Probably the worst shredder on the market.,"There's no way this thing can shred 6 pages at once...I've jammed it with 3 constantly, and now the only thing I shred with it is mail (of course with this machine I have to remove the envelopes first). The only way I can imagine this thing doing what the company says it can do is if someone's shredding pages from the bible; any thicker and you're stuck.Yes, it is cheap. Even if it were cheaper, it'd still be a waste of money. If you're out to see how little you can spend on something that'll take care of documents, grab a pack of matches from a gas station and burn your papers in the sink--it's less annoying than using this thing."
5,Adventurous Prayer,This Bible study guide on prayer is fantastic and was purchased for my group of retired ladies for their fall study. It is very nicely written to encourage all will participate in the discussion.
5,Coming Home to Myself: Reflections for Nurturing a Woman's Body and Soul,I enjoy Marion Woodman's writing and she wrote this book along with Jill Mellick.I have to say I am enjoying this book very much - it is insightful and full of wonderfulshort writings of womans' collective experiences. I highly recommend this book - somethingyou can read over and over. It also has lovely brush painting images between the chapters.
4,Simple game,"I played this game for a few weeks for hours every other day. I found it was pretty simple to kill the enemy just by taking the airfield and defending it while gradually building up your forces between each wave of attacks by the enemy. It was fun to fight against 3 AI forces but it was easy just to defend the area you start out in while the other 3 forces took each other out,all the while you build up your tanks and call in strikes on the remaining forces repair trucks and missile trucks. I thought the graphics were pretty good but I'm not sure what the standard for RTS games is because i have only played a few. I didn't have any problems playing it offline but i was never able to actually play it online but i blame that on my internet provider since i have many problems with online games because of them. I would say for $20 this game is worth a try."
4,A Good All in One,"The Compaq A3000 is a good all in one. I didn't buy it here but I do like Compaq printers. I had one for years until it broke and I replaced it with this item. Its a good copier, printer, and scanner. The only problem that I have with it that I have to set the printing scale for better resolution when printing at higher speeds. Haven't tried printing photos yet will try and let you know. All in all a good all in one for the home."
3,Very Good,"I am struggling with the death of my 93 year old mother. I needed something to help me sort out my feelings, thoughts, up and downs and this work book is helping a lot."
1,Ultima Online yet another faliure,"Oh my god i can't even begin to talk about how boring this game is. All you do is walk around a baddly made and animated world, killing stupid creatures. Don't be deluded by the low price either, as a matter of fact the creators of the game will acctually leach money out of your banck account, about [$$] every month amounting to a stunning [$$$] a year. I'm sorry but WHO in thier right mind would pay that much for this, AND IT NOT EVEN WORTH IT. You go around getting whiped by super players that play WAY too much. but the wierd thing is even when u manage to struggle up to the top with these super players u get really BORD cos u can beat every thing. And i mean who finds accumulating virtual money, FUN and braging about it afterwards to your friend NOT ME. I would say more bad things but i won't but keep all i said in mind. :)"
3,Funny in Parts,"I pity the unpublished writer who fails to read the introduction to this book. It is a satire so don't heed the ""advice."" I found parts to be very funny, and some not so funny. Actually, I thought it was overwritten. I think it would have been more effective as an essay. There are some insider jokes that probably will sail over the heads of those who are not attuned to the publishing business."
1,Not what I expected,"My dad had knee surgery recently, and we were joking that his epitaph would have to include the fact that he now has a part from a cadaver. I wanted to get him a book of FUNNY epitaphs, and this one is full of the overblown poetry about the nature of death. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for, but I wanted something different."
1,Just terrible,"The movie is poorly done (there are shots that get out of focus more than once) and the acting is terrible. Adriana's character's dad is terrible with, an accent that sounds nothing like an Italian accent. The dialogue is terrible, and the plot is even worse, if one can call that a plot. There is really no use getting into the plot, its just not clever or funny. I would not recommend this movie, it is not entertaining or funny, and I am ""glad"" I only rented it on Instant video, I'd never buy this movie."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen.,"I am at a loss for words to describe how bad this movie is. It is a bad porn in which there are no explicit sex scenes, only bad acting and poor direction."
5,my 5 year old and 7 year old boys love it,"wonderful illustrations, reading these books allows my kids to escape back in time."
1,Gonna have to pass on this one,"I see that Fred received alot of good reviews for this CD, but in my opinion this CD is really bad. The first 2 songs (You Are My Daily Bread, Lord of The Harvest)are by far the best on the CD and it is all downhill from there. Purpose By Design was so much better than this CD, and if you liked that one you'll be greatly disappointed in this latest effort. The praise and worship songs on this CD cannot even compare to those of Purpose By Design. Lyically and musically this CD is not hitting the mark. I'm glad I listened to it before I bought it, now I'm hoping to find the first two songs of this CD on some WOW compilation or something. Fred is capable of doing way better. Peace"
5,Excellent !!,"John Coltrane was one of the greatest jazz artist of all time.Listening to this cd made me remeber what the feeling of love and music is.This cd is very relaxing and breath taking and almost makes him come to life again.I really love ""My one and only Love""that song is one of the best but the whole cd is beautiful.I suggest that you buy this cd along with his many other great albums."
5,Lovers Inc.,This CD is awesome.It is very romantic.If you have that special someone this is for you. Light a fire and grab some bubbly.
4,Bury Me in Niagara,I found the DVD in good quality. However I did not like the organization of the menu. After some playing around I got it to run as it did not start immediately as I am used to by DVDs. The film itself is a nice spoof on everything from gangster theft to mother-son conflict. It's a one off comedy that some may enjoy.
2,"Wonderful show, Terrible quality.","To start off, I loved these OVAs when I watched them when they first came out.They were stunning and so crisp. They were what anime should look like!And the story is excellent.I expected the blu-ray version to top the digital form I'd previously seen, so I bought it when I found it had finally been released.Unfortunately, whoever did this version did a terrible job. It is blurry and looks to be a much older anime than it is.I have been impressed with blu ray quality in all my other experiences and was disappointed in this.I had looked forward to buying them after watching them on Youtube, but now I am a bit regretful that I did.On a brighter note, the English voice acting is incredibly well done, even on par with the Japanese...except maybe for Fai's, who seems to not have the same tone he did during the tv series."
5,best of the best anime,"This ova will make your head spin and heart ache. This is truly Clamp's best acommplishment. great stroy-line, beautiful artwork. I cried a lot watching this ova. I do recommend anime fan to buy this ova to have in your collection."
4,Very easy to follow. A big help!,I passed reading & math and am waiting for the writing score. This book was a big help. Very good reviews for each of the three tests. You would be happy with this book.
2,Interesting But Hardly Convincing,"As a member of one of those groups that are destroying the Eden that was America - the white, European, English-speaking, morally upright America of days now gone - I read works like this to try and gauge if there are legitimate reasons for their (conservatives like Geyer) dismay. It's hard however to sympathise with the author's underlying discomfort with the color of my skin or the language of my parents. Feeling sympathy for those who want to harm you, and would if they could, is a luxury for the very powerful or the very masochistic. This ""white lioness"" is just wrong for believing Americans are not Americans because they are different, not-so-pale inividuals."
3,What kind of stamps are these?,The pictures of these stamps like nice on the cover of the book but I want to know what style stamps these are and are they would mounted. Also it would be great to know appx. what size they are. I love stamps.
1,Vanity Press Indeed!,"It pains me to think that a living tree died to create this trash I would not even use as toilet paper if I were absolutely desperate.I'm glad Loreena McKennitt won the privacy suit against Ms. Ash. The book was poorly written, redundant, and an utter waste of time. I wish I could sue Ms. Ash for the hour and a half it took me to finish while in a doctors office. Thank god I didn't pay for this thing or I'd be really upset.This book is nothing more than a long, tedious romp down Ms. Ash's own petty ego of broken dreams and leech-like clinging to those with fame. Its really sad how far some people will go to suckle at the crumbs of others - and how vicious they can be when they are cast off like the parasites they are.I'd advise any true fan of Ms. McKennitt to avoid this bit of rubbish. It is nothing you'd care to waste your time on. Instead, buy Ms. McKennitt's new CD ""An Ancient Muse"" on sale here at Amazon. It is a MUCH nicer way to spend time with the legend herself!"
1,"Oh, sweet justice!","""Ash says she cannot afford to pay the court costs and will declare bankruptcy. Alternatively, she is considering filing an appeal, on grounds that the proceedings were unfair. McKennitt was represented at trial by lawyers affiliated with Carter-Ruck, one of London's most prestigious firms. Ash had used up a 100,000 libel insurance policy preparing for the case and was forced to represent herself at the hearing."" -- The Globe and Mail.Tee hee!"
3,Standard Hat,We got this to make a halloween costume. It's a good standard yellow hat. Also the adjustable strap in back is velcro.
4,Very Innovative,This is the most innovative game of the year. Totally different from anything that I've ever played. I've been playing the online version and found it engaging and surprising.It's definately very cool to get a call from a crazy person on your drive home! Well worth trying. Your going to get about 2-3 months of gaming out of this.
1,Doesn't meet expectations and hype,"I had high hopes for this game, and waited anxiously for it to be released on the internet, and joined right away. But what a disappointment! The episodes are poorly written, lack content and engaging plot and the 'interactive' parts like phone calls and email seem more like a gimmick than a way to blend real life with the game. The puzzles are way too easy, there is not enough to do, there is no way to change the outcome of events through your own actions (ie the plot is painfully linear to the point of stupidity), and *way* too much time is spent waiting for no apparent reason. The hype provided more entertainment than the game does.One good thing about the boxed version though is there should be 4 episodes plus the pilot live by the time it comes out, so at least you won't have weeks of standby time till the next episode starts."
5,excellent book,It is excellent book for every uropathologist. It covers almost every aspect of urine cytology. Definitely recommend it to my colleagues.
3,"Good, but some details are wrong","I listened to the CDs, read by the author. It was pretty good but the author's failure to get details right made me question whether he really knew what he was talking about, or if he had really done the things he claimed to have done. For example, he refers to the ""PUK"" as the ""Popular Union of Kurdistan"" several times. Everyone knows that the P stands for Patriotic, not Popular. If he really was in northern Iraq, the author would know this. Not saying it's not worth the time, just that I question the accuracy of some of what's there."
2,Credibility...,"While Robert Baer's recollections and analysis can occasionally be interesting, he's not always very insightful. Here's The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh, quoting Baer, a little more than one week before the Saddam's downfall and Baghdad's liberation:""Robert Baer, a former C.I.A. Middle East operative, told me in a telephone call from Jordan, ""Everybody wants to fight. The whole nation of Iraq is fighting to defend Iraq. Not Saddam. They've been given the high sign, and we are courting disaster. If we take fifty or sixty casualties a day and they die by the thousands, they're still winning. It's a jihad, and it's a good thing to die. This is no longer a secular war."" There were press reports of mujahideen arriving from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Algeria for ""martyrdom operations.""""Or not. And it puts a bit of a dent in Baer's credibility."
4,SEE NO EVIL,"""See no Evil"" by Robert Baer was a good book that gave a new perspective of the CIA. Robert Baer gives us an insight at how dangerous and complicated it could be for a field agent, any mistake that Baer and other field agents did could ultimately end up with a lot of trouble and even death for the agents and their sources. Even though some of the things Baer wrote were kind of hard to follow it was an interesting book that allowed us to see the involvement of the government as far as terrorism. The government for many instances had the chance to prevent some of the horrible things that were made by terrorists. The government had insight and proof on some of the worst terrorist groups and the leaders but the government didn't seem to care. Baer writes about all these subjects and also believes the government could have known about attacks, like September 11, ahead of time. Robert Baer's book ""see no evil"" changes the view people have about the CIA, the people who risk their life."
5,A Powerful Tool for Communion With Kuan Yin,"The chant on this CD has been known to create instant healing through this goddess of love and compassion. Lisa's voice is angelic, as usual, and the chant is soothing, meditative and easy to learn. The CD can be used as a meditation tool and since there are several different tracks, you can choose the length of your meditation. I do an incredible amount of driving, and this CD is also suitable for listening in the car. It's very balancing and won't zone you out so much that you put yourself at risk. I tend to pull this CD out whenever I'm feeling anxious or depressed and it always leaves me with a feeling of renewed love, trust and faith."
5,Documenting an Era,"When historians look back at the Internet bubble in fifty years, Esser's book will be one of the primary sources they cite again and again. It captures the zeitgeist of the Bubble the way only stellar journalism can, evoking the personalities and rituals of that bizarre time while making sense out of the interplay of forces that fed the dot-com phenomenon.The book works not just as a document, but also as a cautionary tale and a guide for future entrepreneurs: by analyzing what was done WELL by the engineers of the Internet Economy, Esser manages to point out a path for companies (and workers) just getting on their feet in the new millenium."
1,Not worth the effort.,There are so many good such products. Why bother to put out a really useless product?
2,Reference,The software is a little hard to use. It sometimes choses another word for the word you have typed in. It takes a while to be able to use it.
5,Simply Amazing,"This is one of the best trance cd's I've ever heard. The first few times I listened to it, I didn't think much of it, but every time since it gets better and better. The mixing is flawless, and the cd flows seamlessly together. ""Purple Overdose"" is my favorite track."
1,Mine wasn't right!,"Apparently they sent me the wrong wig for this order. The wig that I received was curly and hot pink, (or fusia color)!"
1,bad hair day with this wig,"this is by far the cheapest wig of the ten ordered..would not recommend to anyone for the poor quality..hair fell out just getting it out of the package and when you combed it they really fell out..loved the color and style but i guess i made a bad choice on this purchase...not even worth the low price paid compaired to the others at or near the same price..bad quality, don't purchase"
1,Displeased,I bought this and two others and all three came with the wrong answers in the back. I was very disappointed.
3,The authority on sword classification,"This book is an incredibly detailed academic work on the classification of swords from the 10th century through to the 15th century.The book is well written, and includes many clear photos (black and white) as well as dozens of sketchs to aid in the identification of these weapons.The book is full of various historical bits pertaining to each class of sword.However what makes this book so good, also makes it near useless to anyone but the die-hard sword collector. The book never strays from its details of sword classifications and thier dates of usage. I would not recommend reading this book ""for the fun of it""."
5,Extraordinary!,"A page turning book that gives a voice back to one woman. A woman who was perhaps like many of us, a wife, mother, friend and most likely looking forward to her ""golden years"" the time of harvesting a life well lived with grandchildren, a summer cottage by the lake, battling weeds among roses and then the unthinkable happens. She receives the diagnosis that she is infected with the HIV virus. Nothing remains the same. This reader was struck by how we so take for granted the everydayness of life and how we can so easily forget to take the lids off our light and indeed off our voices. For this woman, the author's mother, her life was ended too soon, her story suffocated under the ramping vortex of fear, shame and lies. The pain behind secret is revealed. This book had to be written to peel back the scabs of secrecy to restore one of the voices lost to the plague of our time."
5,Deserves Exposure,"Dave's wonderful debut would've been huge 20 years ago. With music industries being what they are today-[...]-it's difficult for a real musician like this to get the exposure he so desperately deserves. This is great roots rock/folk, done with a distinct Canadian sound. It's hard edged roots music at it's best.Music for the spirit I say."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT,i just got this recorder and i wanted to record some music from tv so i put iclose to the loud speaker and pressed the record button i then put the recorded tape in a cassette player to hear the recorded sound it was hardly audible DO NOT BUY THIS THING
2,The product won't play my tapes,The products won't play my tapes. The player plays to slow. Put the setting on the hightest speed the sound is is slow.
4,Works fine with good sound for a small box,"We purchased the Sony tape unit as a player, not a recorder. Sound reproduction is reasonable -- we're using it for taped voice rather than music."
2,Minnie Mouse?,"Seems fine but even with brand new batteries, voices sound like Minnie. Is it calibrated at the wrong speed? Doesn't seem to be very loud either, and also it really does have a lot of hiss. Overall, not happy, especially considering the price."
4,tape recorder,"this the old fashioned cassette type machine. works fine, less expensive than a digital one."
3,Not as good as could be.,"I'm almost positive I reviewed this product not long ago. But I will do it again.For a Panasonic product, it is a disappointment. It doesn't pick up well at all from a public address system. The sound is terrible. I will probably just give it away. I don't know why they want me to review a Sony product, when I bought a Panasonic recorder.??????? Somebody doesn't know whats going on here."
3,"Vanessa, anyone?","The first ""Playboy Video Playmate Calendar"" I bought new was the 1989 one to see Chinese Playmate Diana Lee, and I now have most of them from 1987-2008. I ordered the 2009 one, but my money was refunded. Evidently, just a few were made. In this 2000 one, Vanessa Gleason is my favorite model, and it has her best scenes in any of her videos I own. Tishara Cousino and Laura Cover are also attractive to me, and Angela Little is rather cute. I only watch the scenes with the four girls listed, for the rest are forgettable to me. I prefer brunettes usually, e.g. Vanessa Gleason and Tishara Cousino, but Laura Cover is sexy, and Angela Little is cute, as I said."
3,Lacks a true star for me,"All the girls are pretty enough but unless you're collecting the entrie series (like me) I don't see a stand-out reason to get this year. I'll ""soon"" have reviews on every year to better serve that purpose. Even Heather Kozar had better clips on the 1999 calendar so if she's your reason for getting it, I'd get that instead. But that's just my opinion.Rewatching this recently, I'd have to upgrade it to 3 1/2 stars because Vanessa Geason has a near perfect, all natural body. I kind of wish she won PMOY instead of Heather Kozar who has great enhanced breasts & an overall nice body herself but when it's even close, I'd go with all natural over enhanced these days."
4,Nice,They were nice. They were different because of the square shape. I gave them to a co-worker so I dont know how they hold up
4,What makes it WRONG?,"Frey critically examines the claims of moral vegetarianism. Is eating meat Wrong because, 1) it violates animal rights, because 2) killing animals is wrong, because 3) it causes animals pain and suffering? Frey examines each of these arguments and finds them wanting.His own perspective is utilitarian but rejects the utilitarian arguments of Peter Singer and Tom Regan. He is well versed in the ethical literature, and this work bears on many ethical issues beyond animal welfare.Frey's work is a serious challenge to those who wish to offer more than emotional arguments for moral vegetarianism (as in other reviews offered here!)."
2,disappointed,My purchase was suppose to be new but when I got it the box didn't have all that it was suppose to. I was suppose to get 13 of each glass I got 12. I wrote them an email explaining that and askin what I should do as far as should I return everything or can they just send me out me out the missing glass. I have yet to receive a response. I guess they already have my money so they don't care about my satisfaction. Needless to say I will never order from them again because I didn't get my money worth. Still waiting for a response!!!!!hmmmm
5,Awesome!,Shot glasses are perfect size for having to take so many shots in one game! The board is really nice and it's mailed delicately so you won't have to worry about broken pieces or anything along those lines.
5,WOW,"This is a great variety pack, I bought it to experiment with the mats. My cats are already huge fans for Fat Cat products but when this set came in, they all flipped. I've had this for about 2 hours now and both mats are being slept on and the toys are soaking wet. Highly recommended for any catnip lover!"
4,I liked it. Late night mood music from Dino.,"This CD is an imported reprint of ""Late at Night with Dean Martin"". This imported copy is of lower cost than the quoted original but just as good. The average Amazon rating for the original is 4 1/2 stars, and I'd recommend and rate this import the same. Nice mellow late night music, with a song list that includes:1. Everybody Loves Somebody2. Imagination3. I'm Yours4. Baby Won't You Please Come Home5. Dream6. I Wish You Love7. Mean To Me8. I'll Buy That Dream9. It's Easy To Remember10. Let Me Love You Tonight11. I'm Confessin' (That I Love You)12. All I Do Is Dream Of You13. My Melancholy Baby14. Dream A Little Dream Of Me15. Arrivederci Roma"
3,"An autobiographical work, not a self-help book","I was expecting this to be a self-help book...in reality it's a collection of stories from the author's life. I enjoyed what I read but I ended up returning it because it wasn't really what I was looking for, which was practical advice on how to reclaim one's passion and purpose in life. Had I been looking for an inspirational autobiographical work, I probably would have taken more time with it and might have given it 5 stars like the other reviewers - it's certainly very poetic, beautiful, and inspirational, but for me at least it wasn't totally relatable to my immediate challenges."
3,A little lost.,"I guess I have to go back and read this book again after reading all the glowing comments. I did get lost in the first few chapters as someone commented. Maybe it was the whole idea of having the luxury of 6 months of seclusion in a cabin in Utah--who won't feel renewed? This seemed more like a biography to me and not a ""self help"" as I thought it would be."
4,It's ok,"If your a Kevin Smith fan, and interested in film in general check this book out. Despite many..many type-o's the book is worth a read."
1,Too Many Shallow Characters,"I was given this book by a female relative who told me it was a fine read...I'm seriously considering dropping her from my will. The characters (far too many, even for a well written book, which this is not) are unbelievable shallow and have the emotional reaction time of a sloth on Rufinol. Why I spent so much of my valuable time struggling to get through the first hundred pages, I'll never know. This book is now under a short table leg serving what I believe to be its best purpose."
2,pics not included,"I borrowed this book and enjoyed it enought to purchase, and another for a gift. Imagine, the pictures that are supposed to be in the middle of the book...ARE NOT included."
5,Why Browns fans loved their team,"A great look back for Browns fans, especially those of us who were just little kids the last time the Browns won the championship. The players tell why the '64 team was so close and so successful, and it is interesting to see what happended to the players since then -- especially since few made a lifetime's worth of money in their playing days like today's players do -- these guys actually had to go out and get a job and a career when they retired from football. Maybe that's why these great players are remembered so fondly -- they were just like us expect they could take the field for us on Sundays too. Fond memories for Browns fans who miss their heroes on Sundays, and a good book for general football fans who want to know what made a great team click."
4,A Needed OPENGL dev guide,Being new to opengl I have found this book a great help. It covers all areas of opengl with great examples. The cover CD has lots of utils and code to copy and play with. This is a needed book for anyone looking to get into Opengl development.
1,I agree with Westie... .aweful,I bought this at target. I put it in our machine and I thought our machine was broken. The sound came through fine (althought I agree with not being very recognizable). The words were glitchy and not on cue with the music. I then stuck an old karoke cd I have and it worked great. Don't buy this one.
5,Does what it says,"Does what it says. Nicely done, easy to use. Heavy enough. Goes without problem both with my KORG M1 and Cakewalk DAW."
3,dish out money for better pedal,"eh. it works on my m-audio keystation perfectly, but it barely functions on my Yamaha MO8. whatevr. i'm over it. just shut up already. pedals are dumb."
5,From a keyboard to a piano,Bought this pedal for my keyboard and it works great. Strong and heavy feel and works just like a regular piano pedal tranforming my keyboard into the feel of my old piano. After studying many pedals I am very happy I chose this one.
2,Bad Support and Sustain Does Not Appear to Record in Midi,"First the good news. The peddle works fine when one uses it with the M-Audio Keystation 49e. I use it with an Apple iMac and Logic Express or Garageband.However, for some reason it does not appear to record the sustained notes with the sustains as midi signals which play back with the sustains; just the notes play. Obviously this changes the sound quite a bit.So I called Tech Support to ask if there was something which could be done about this aspect of the unit's performance. Silly me. I spent 45 minutes on hold - and not to an 800 number. I never did get a tech support person to speak to and decided that my time was better spent elsewhere.Call M-Audio on their pre-purchase support line in ADVANCE and ask them about this issue if its something which you think might be of importance to your purchase or use of the product."
2,works great until it breaks,"All I can say is its a fine pedal in my experience for a year of heavy use, but after that it starts to bust. The pedal starts slipping from side to side in its groove and only works if I push it all the way to one side. I have gone through about 4 of these in the past 4 years, thinking that the breaking is always a fluke because so many Amazon customers seem to love it. I'm finally giving up, its not a super solid pedal that will last for professional amount of usage."
5,Works with the Yamaha PRS-9000,"I ordered this pedal to use as a sustain pedal for my church's Yamaha PRS-9000. It works perfectly and I didn't have to change any settings on the keyboard or the pedal (there is a small switch on the bottom of the pedal to change how it operates, may be needed on some keyboards).The pedal itself seems to be of solid construction and looks nice under our keyboard. A hard plastic cover for the pedal itself is included, which should keep the metal looking nice for actual performances."
5,Works fine,YES !!! this is what I have been looking for !!! so sweet like creamy icing vanilla and cookies and candy all together!!! I loved it so much I bought all the products that came with it!
5,Very Good!,She has been using 3 years now & still works like a charm. Well worth the money - would recommend!
5,Good pedal at a great price,"If you are looking for a sustain pedal, this is it. Built solid, feels like it could withstand a good beating, which is good since my teen is using it. Not complaints, just works and is reasonably priced."
4,Great,"As with the previous reviewer, I HIGHLY recommend professional installation. This nut is incredible otherwise, I don't even use a tremelo on my strat and it definitely helped with tuning."
5,Love this toothbrush!,"I bought this, loved it, bought another for my husband, and he also loves it. I have always had issues with feeling like I really have to scrub to get my teeth clean enough, which ends up making my gums more sore, among other issues. This toothbrush really makes my teeth feel clean without the terrible hard scrubbing from before. It holds a charge long enough to get me at least through a week (I used to travel a lot for work), which is so helpful. I really like the 3 functions too for the added benefits of gum stimulation and cleaning your tongue. Great product! I just wish I could find the toothbrush heads in stores. I have yet to see them locally and end up having to order online."
1,Bad Choice,"The concept is nice, but the product quality is very bad.mine is S-320 complete, after about 6 months of usage the power button stop working i had to press it like 10 times to make it work or some times it work some times not.Now i don't know what happened to the charger as well, the device is not charging properly, i can see the LED indicator blinking in very odd way.Bottom of line! Do not buy this product, it is expensive and not reliable"
2,"Worked great, while it worked","Bought this in October, 2005. Really liked the cleaning action and appreciated the ""buzzer"" feature telling you when to switch sections of your mouth. Up until about a week ago (late May, 2006) I would have given it a four, possibly a five, star rating. Then, the switch just stopped working. It will either not turn on the brush or will turn it on for a few seconds and then it will go off.I'm sorry, but when I pay nearly a $100.00 (inc. shipping) for something, I actually expect it to last more than seven months.Not recommended.Now I have to buy a replacement and am stuck with the three extra heads I so foolishly purchased, thinking it would last that long.Its predecessor, a plain old Braun Oral B, lasted me over five years. Will NOT be replacing it with a Braun product, for sure."
2,Short battery life,I liked this product but the battery only lasted a year. Now it won't hold a charge and I have to buy a new one. Disappointing considering the price.
5,very good performance,"A very good performance, quick, very efficient and perfect . Abhinavagupta's Paratrisika Vivarana is a very fascinating approach to the Trika's conception of Kashmir Shaivism and his enormous corpus of texts and their innumerables , various aspects of the same formulation."
5,Perfect,Love the games to be able to watch them on dvd is greatI was hoping however that i would be on blue ray but regardless great series.
3,do i exist,I have written reviews for movies Like The animal. I know what I talk about and well this is a book.
3,Over-done cliches much?,"For anyone familiar with this author they will know that this is the 3rd book in the Comanche series. Indigo Blue is not the best of the series, but is okay.I guess my chief complaint would be the over-done cliche of another Native American character(although Indigo is quarter) who has a 'special' ability with animals. Oh spare me! The author actually had the main character feeding a toothless mountain lion at one point. The look on your face right now? Yeah, that was my reaction as well. And don't even get me started on how she wanted us to believe the Comanche women had to 'obey' their husbands. Total crap.On the flip side, I did completely empathize with Indigo's hesitation and fear of Jake Rand as her husband. This was a man that had the ability to make her leave her home and everyone she loved. Not too mention how she felt after her attack in book 2.Survey says: I'd give it a shot if you are the type of person who absolutely has to finish the series."
5,Makes a mighty fine malted turkey,"I bought this syrup to use on my Thanksgiving turkey. The turkey was brined for 12 hours in a bath of salt, herbs, dark beer, and this barley malt syrup, then basted in a gravy of the syrup while it cooked. Not only did my bird turn out tender, looking like a glistening piece of candy, but my inlaws stripped it to the bone like a school of piranhas on a dead horse. Anyone interested in the recipe can go to the Bon Appetite website and search for ""Malt turkey"".Never brewed with it, though."
3,$15 for green,This is one dollar more than the large BIA Cordon Bleu doric crock. I need this additional crock for wood cooking spoons and green completes the green yellow red color trinity that always always works.
4,The old 1200 just keeps going,"Gotta love this beast, it just keeps going, not finicky about drivers, you don't even have to install anything on a new Mac OS. The one I used at work died, but slowly, I knew it was going out, no sudden ""Oh, my printer's just died"" more like ""Hey Boss, I'm going to need a new printer sometime soon"" and this was after a long and productive life."
3,could be much better if the screenplay was better,"what we saw here is a trend that the cool 'district 13' french movie has set up. these urban explorers indeed are amazing, put all the olympic games to shame. but this movie's screenplay really sucks big time, wasted a bunch of cool young men's energy to nowhere. amazing stunts with deadbeat storyline. what a shame."
4,Another pretty Rembrandt charm,I have found Rembrandt charms to be very reliable. I bought this one in sterling silver and was very happy with it.
2,Chai Room CD,"I felt mislead by the CDs description, and was expecting something more Middle-Eastern and Indian themed,ancient sounds wirth a modern twist, whereas instead, it is mostlty Latin-sounding, modern pieces. Not at all what I thought I was getting. A real disappointment."
4,A must for anyone doing a serious study of BTVS.,"The first chapter alone is worth the price of the book. It provides and exhaustive look at the first six seasons of BTVS and some of ANGEL. A great episode guide is included. Better written than the Watcher's Guides, but not as informative. This is a collection of essays with some scholarly merit."
1,The worst piece of literature I have ever read,"I am so disappointed in this book. I am always on the lookout for books about the Saints. So when I read this I was not expecting to pick up a book that borders on pornography. The constant demeaning attitude the author expresses about the virtuous lives of the Saints is positively sickening. The Saints are honored in the Church so that we can understand that holiness is for everyone. Just because someone chooses not to give in to base instincts and to fight against vice does not make them psychotic, masochist or weird. What makes it even worse is that Catholics who don't know much about the Faith will read this book and think it's right up there with ""normal"" thinking about the Church and the Saints. This book deserves -10 stars."
3,"Great bottle, but nipples don't stay slow","Great bottles, but the nipples get fast after a few weeks of use. Mine are a month old and the milk comes out in a pretty fast steady stream if you tip them over. Not the best for month old infant that needs the slow nipple. Other than the nipple, a great product."
4,"Great bottle, great price!","We used Avent with our first child, and had that for our daughter too. However, she had a lot of issues with gas so we tried different bottles. After asking around we landed on these, and were thrilled. She uses a medium flow nipple at 10 months, and she hardly has gas issues anymore. That being said, if you can check out local stores as they were half the price of what they are here on Amazon. I love you Amazon, but your prices are getting steep.There has been one bottle that got a crack in it, but I even dropped a bottle on to our concrete floor and it did not break. Also, for formula these bottles are very narrow in the neck. I ended up making my own funnel with an old breastpump attachment, which makes it a lot less messy."
5,glass bottles,"I have been reading about the many chemicals in plastic and the dangers of heating it in the microwave or dishwasher. I decided to switch to all glass bottles and I could not be happier. They are easy to clean, you can put them in the dishwasher and I have peace of mind knowing they are not harmful for my child."
2,"Okay, but it doesn't vent","These are your old-fashioned, sturdy glass bottles. So if you're used to a Dr. Browns', which vents so well, you'll be disappointed. My son sucks and sucks and when I take the bottle out of his mouth, air gets pulled in through the nipple, creating all kinds of bubbles. I tried to use the Dr. Brown's interior venting system, but it's just a hair too long to fit in the bottle. If they were just a bit shorter, they'd fit. I'm starting to think the extra money for the Born Free bottles is worth it."
1,Nipple sucks!!!,These bottles sucks! The nipple keeps collasping after every 5 sucks... I keep having to interrupt my baby's feeding after every 5 sucks to fix the nipple...
5,Hard to find item...,Concerned about the chemicals in plastic bottles? Me too! I was thrilled to find that Amazon had these glass ones in stock. Now I don't have to worry about warming my breastmilk for the babysitter or my husband to give my little one. A great buy!
2,Good for storage but bad for feeding,"Like most reviewers, I bought these along with Dr. Brown's glass bottles to see which ones I can use to replace my Avent plastic bottles due to BPA concerns. These were cheaper but as stated in a lot of reviews, the nipples were useless. They collapsed and my son gave up trying to nurse after awhile. I now use these to store my expressed breast milk in the fridge and use my Dr. Brown ones to feed my baby. Overall, it was a cheap solution for milk storage but definitely not for feedings. Dr. Brown glass vented bottles are great although having so many little parts to deal with is a bit annoying."
3,could be better,"This product doesnt have any air reduction system. If there is too much vaccum in the bottle the nipple can collapse. Not so great, and has caused a few leaks all over because of it I suspect. I usually use the bottle to warm up water on the stove then transfer to another bottle."
3,glass nursers,"I ordered these almost a year ago and the glass was heavier in the first order, and the silicone nipples are made differently. One silicone nipple came with the tip almost ripped off, presenting a choking hazard!(the new shipment) Apparently they have moved manufacturing to another country, because they are not made as well as they were even a year ago.Even so, I prefer them to plastic bottle feeding. If you order these, be sure to inspect the nipples very carefully poking your finger through to make sure they won't rip."
1,Glass bottles break and hurt when you drop them,"Glass bottles are far more dangerous than any plastic bottle could ever be. They break and have razor sharp edges. They drop on your feet. They get thrown (maybe at you). Go with plastic. Maybe for the first few months you can get away with 4oz glass bottles. But by the time your child is ready for 8oz, switch to plastic."
2,yuck,I should have read the description better regarding the sound bites between some songs. I found them to be annoying. The Time Life collection is so much better and it doesn't cost much more.
2,Soundbites On Every Disk,"It's simple. I'm sorry I bought this. Soundbites connected to the tracks of 33 songs! I didn't realize the soundbites aren't separate, but connected to the actual song track. Some of the bites are in front of the song and some at the end. You can't edit them away from the song without some time and editing equipment. Everytime you listen to the song you get to hear the soundbite. I gave it a generous 2 stars because the songs alone sound great."
4,"Average, maybe worth the money","Bought this for our 20 month old, she is slowly learning to enjoy the ride.have had it for a few months now:it seems sturdy enough, will last a year or 2 depending on usestickers peel off easilyeasy to charge and charge seems to lastnot much educational value if that is what you are looking forrides well on carpets and sidewalks, not too good on floors etcoverall would buy it if it were on sale for around $4x.xx, no more than $50"
5,Dora Quad - Awesome!!,Perfect for young kids. My 18 mos old was a little scared and it took her awhile to warm up to the quad and she is a very daring child as it is so I was a little surprised. My neice is 2 and she rode it for hours and it held up. We charge it at night and the kids ride by day. For the price I got it at - I could not turn it down. It's a lot of fun!!
5,Amazing cleaning power,"Since installing this air filter, I have noticeably less dust in the room. I also find that I suffer fewer asthma attacks.I used it at a party, and it sensed the cigarette smoke in the room and operated to purify the air. There were a few noisy, obnoxious guests at this party, and after the fan had operated for about 3 minutes, those guests were gone. We're not sure, but no one has heard from them since, so I think the filter got them."
4,great shape pan,I love the shape of this pan!! Especially for a whole fish or flank steak it is great.I WISH it could be made a bit heavier(better heat distribution) and dishwasher SAFE
3,all doctors should read this book to help them make decision,"The doctor involved had to make a decision and only God knows if he did the right thing or not. But for a reader of this book, I sincerely suggest that all doctors read thia book, which can no doubt help them to think before making a fatal decision."
5,my corvette girlfriend and I,i love corvettes i am 16 and live in Boston massachusettes. I just got my black c5 convertible!!! its awesome!!!!! with many new accessories the c5 emblem hat was one of them. this is a great looking hat for you corvette lovers!!! it was deffinetly worth buying. i first found it on ecklers.com but i did a search and amazon sells it the cheapest. 15$ compared to 18$ or 20$ it was a deal. You have to get this hat its totally sweet!!!
4,Great anime with a mind twist,"This anime really is one of the better ones out there, but it takes some getting used to. First off, when I first watched it I couldnt stand the voice of the main character but after about episode 7 his voice didn't bother me anymore and the story started to pick up. In the end, the series throws you for a loop with an ending where you're going to want to pay attention. without giving away any spoilers I would say its like inception the way the ending is open to interpretation. overall, this anime is one every ADULT (no kids because this show has nudity, cusses and violence galore) anime fanatic should enjoy. If you're not afraid to think about how things end up than this psychological thriller is really worth the ticket price."
2,A poor interpretation of the books,"This could have been a much better interpretation of the manga. The art in the manga is outstanding, but the TV series' art is lazy and choppy for much of the series (it seems to get a bitter better as the show progresses). The show is also incredibly slow moving. My husband hasn't read the manga and agrees the shows are very slow and the art is sub par. What should take five minutes is drawn out four times that long. I think they tried almost too hard to stick to the books.The voice acting is good and they deliver the lines well.If you like the story, read the manga."
3,Ethics,I'm not a big fan of this book as I have read other texts that are more concise than this one. Parts of the text has useful information but I would not highly suggest this text if it is not required for a course.
3,Good Kit,Worked out well for my daughter's science project. Bought several to do the trial 3 time. She got 2nd Place!
2,Sorry did not match my car,"Ordered this part for my '93 Corolla with power steering. Upon removal of the original part and comparing to the new, the inner boot opening did not match. I'm not sure if the new part was for a different car or maybe depended on where it was made USA or Japan."
5,Objective Values,"Since when was the objectivity of morals and values a fact? Last I heard, there was much debate concerning the subjectivity or objectivity of ethics, values, and morals. Claiming that there are objective morals, that it is a fact, and then slamming the book for this self-created truth is irrational."
2,Weak Defense of Ethics Without God,"2 starsWeak Defense of Ethics Without GodIn Ethics Without God, Kai Nielsen forcefully refutes the myth that one cannot be moral without believing in God. However, that is also not very interesting, for theistic philosophers generally would agree with him. Instead, theistic philosophers argue that only theism can (1) explain the fact that objective moral values exist, and (2) offer a reason for behaving morally. Unfortunately, while Nielsen does provide a minimal discussion of the latter claim, his discussion of the former claim isvirtually nonexistent. ..."
3,"Oh, now I understand the 1 star reviews..","Pretty good Gervais effort. Certainly way better than anything mainstream Hollywood has to offer (not hard to do).I was just a bit surprised at first when I saw all of the one star reviews here. It hardly occurred to me when watching the film that there was anything offensive about making fun of the basic premise behind any religion. How naive of me!Oh, well. Here we go again..."
1,makes fun of religion and God,This movie made it out to sound like religion and God and the afterlife are all a joke and a complete lie. Very disturbing and insulting.
1,One of the worst movies ever made...,"I bought this video because I've always enjoyed Jennifer Garner's work. About 5 minutes into the movie, one realizes that the jokes are running thin, and then the main character ""invents"" lying by telling his dying mother that there will be a wonderful place to go after she dies. I was insulted by the overall storyline that a belief in God, and of the afterlife, was the invention of lying. This movie is a STEAMING PILE of horse manure put out by a production company with an obvious political agenda. (Oh, Shame on you Mrs. Garner for accepting this type of role.) I was NOT impressed. PS: Amazon made me as a reviewer give a star rating. I had to give it one star because of this, but if given a chance would have given it -2 stars."
3,Only one brand of beer,"The whole movie is promoting BUDWEISER beer. Is it a lie that Budweiser is the only beer available?The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?I do not have religion. But I have no way of proofing there is no God. In the movie it mentions about mansions afterlife. How about 60"" 3D hi-definition TV for everybody, etc.? It's not what religion about."
5,Provides insight into our daily interactions,"Our lives are filled with lies. Every moment, we wonder about how not to hurt people around us. We do not want to speak the truth. We are so averse to hurting people that we don't even know what the truth is.This movie is like Gulliver's Travels, the novel. It is guffaw funny on one level, but right beneath the glib surface, there are gnawing questions and critiques of how most humans socialize, hide their true feelings, conceal their real disappointments and even their joys.It is satire at its best.Anyone who is offended by this movie, it is because they don't want the veneers to be stripped off. They like the cover up."
5,Good Movie and Film in my City,All actors was in Haverhill Mass did filming for the Movie right in my City and I own it when 1st came out
1,"Ok, so no one lies.... but it's a pile of crap!","The story of no one lying is one thing.... but when the movie opens up with some woman answering the door telling the guy showing up for a date, and she tells him ""he's fat"", and ""I just masturbated"" is where it's so stupid. Just because you don't lie doesn't mean you have to say every cruel or stupid thing that enters into your head, does it?"
4,Great start for my son.,"I gave this to my son for Christmas a couple years ago. It was really better than giving him singing lessons. It's like combining a coach with a video game that he can ""play"" whenever the mood hits him. It was a great value for the price. Last year I upgraded to Singing Coach Pro. He hasn't gotten as into that as he was in this program. The timing of this - Singing Coach Kidz - was perfect for him in 5th grade when he was just starting in Chorus."
5,Leading from Where You Are,"Okay, most leadership books seem to assume you are the CEO, the head of HR or at the very least own your own small business. Basically, they seem to think you are the boss with the authority to change the procedure and behaviors of your organization.Fortunately, this book is not like most. The ""360 degree"" portion of the title refers to the fact that you don't just lead down to subordinate, but also lead across to equals and lead up to superiors. It take into account you may be in the bottom or the middle of the organization.For me this book was required reading as a part of my MBA program and it's the book I most often refer back to now that I have graduated. It's that important and that well written.So whether you are at the top, the bottom or, like most of us, stuck somewhere in the middle, this is the leadership book worth reading."
4,Easy listen.,bought this for school. it was a good price and was an easy listen. i would recommend it for business type people.
3,Better on CD than in Print,"This book was purchased for the upper management staff of the company I work for by the President. Some of them decided to share it with their staff, so I borrowed the book. I purchased this because I was having a hard time getting through the book...it's not very engaging in print. However, it was much easier to get through on CD. The concepts are very common-sensical, but good reminders. Nothing too exciting or revolutionary, but can be useful."
3,The 360 Degree Leader,"Maxwell's leadership principles included in this book are based in common sense and written for everyone. It is a quick, easy read with ideas that can be implemented immediately. If you have read other leadership books, there are no revolutionary ideas here."
2,Not read by the author,"As a long time fan I found the audio CD disappointing. Despite clearly stating the program is read by the author on the back of the CD case, it is not. Buyers beware. I have found the book much more enjoyable than the heavily abridged audio CD."
5,The Best Book on the Topic . . .,"This is by far the best book ever written on the topic of the 1968 Olympic protest by the Black athletes from San Jose State . . . Any question I ever had on the events surrounding John Carlos and Tommie Smith's so-called ""Black Power"" salute on the Olympic dais in Mexico City was found in this book, which speaks from a sociological and historical standpoint. I definitely will be able to use this book not only in my own studies, but in teaching the significant points of the protest to students at SJS.Thanks, Dr. Hartmann!"
3,Bro-ken,"Although this is indeed a fine item, it is only useful as decoration. The two that I had broke very easily during a regular training session. Buy them, but dont use them too roughly."
4,Alias book review.,"This Alias book was okay. I laughed at some parts. The book was a little slow at some parts, but I could still not put it down. You also could see what was going to happen next. It did not have a lot of action because it was all one mission. I would read this book again, though."
3,Weakest of the three,"This book just doesn't appear to have the same level of effort behind its development as the previous two novels. It feels rushed, almost as if it was completed simply to meet a deadline.Sookie flies into irrational fits of anger that just don't make any sense. There are stake-wielding characters, capable of providing an engaging sub-plot, who appear to have existed only to provide Sookie with a stake for later use.Blah. This just plain wasn't satisfying."
5,Read all three in this series in three days!,"I bought these books for my 15 year old daughter, but couldn't put them down myself. I was extremely surprised, because I've been burned out on the romance/mystery/supernatural genre for a long time. It was just the right mix of of all of the above, but with characters that were extremely likeable and believable. It was extremely interesting how the different species interact. I think what hooked me was that the heroine is someone who, like many of us, has suffered from feeling different and out of the loop, but has not allowed her suffering to embitter her, and never wallows in self pity, but instead always finds the strength to keep on keeping on, doing what needs to be done, doing the decent thing. Even though she goes from someone who never had a date to someone who is attractive to a multitude of men, she doesn't let it go to her head and retains her sense of autonomy. No simpering, fainting heroine, this one.A really enjoyable read on many levels."
4,Another great Sookie story,"I am a huge fan of this series, and I love the introduction of the Alcide character in this one. Two thumbs way up."
2,"What, again?",How many times can an author recycle a love-plot that is only tepid from the start? Harris seems determined to find out.
5,Enlightenment made simple,"In this amazing series of essays, Harry Palmer demonstrates through wonderful stories and analogies that understanding our human experience doesn't require a degree in philosophy from a major university.Harry's essays have the feel of parables. The most profound concepts revealed in everyday experience that we can all relate to.This book is a treasure. I have no doubt that when people begin to discover this goldmine of wisdom, the book will be flying off the shelf."
1,Heaven at Home begins with respect,"You can't beat your children into submission. They learn that big people are bullies and its okay to hit, but only if you are bigger than the person that you are hitting. Children need to be taught with love, respect and consistent rules and discipline that does not undermine their well being. I have two boys (13 and 7), that have never been spanked. They have both been student of the month this year, The 13y/o is an honor roll student in advanced classes. My children are awesome without being having to be beaten."
5,"As M-Audio device good quality, strong and better than others",M-Audio SP-1 US65000 Sustain Pedal for KeyboardsA better product than others for the price
2,Crappy sustain pedal,"Worked ok for a couple of months, then intermittently and finally it broke after a year or so,it's cheaply made, and as mentioned in other posts, has a thin wire acting as a switch inside,(mine broke, so I can't really fix it)."
3,Solid and sturdy but can be unreliable,"The M-Audio SP-1 US65000 is a sturdy and solid pedal. The case is metal, not plastic, so it'll hold up well over time. The rubber pads on the top and bottom keep it from moving around, though the pads have a tendency to come loose.The main reliability issue with the pedal is the low-cost construction inside. Instead of having the pedal actuate a switch inside, there's just a stiff bare wire that presses down against another bare wire to make contact. It works and is cheaper to manufacture than using a real switch. However, if the pedal goes unused for a few days, oxidation forms on the bare wire, which results in unreliable contact and flaky pedal response. Depressing the pedal a dozen or more times clears off the oxidation. If it doesn't, opening the pedal and cleaning the wire resolves any inconsistent/noisy pedal signals.If you're handy with a soldering iron, replacing the pseudo-switch with a real momentary contact switch would yield a really great pedal."
4,HEALING?,This book makes a lot of cense. But it really messed up my Tummy. I think I like the Hay diet a bit better.
1,Backjoy Too Expensive,I think that this is a rip-off for the money they charge. C'mon! $80.00 for that? (I purchased it right from the Backjoy website and I guess that was my first mistake.) I didn't notice much of a difference when using it. Too much money for what it is.
2,Is'n doing much of anything for me,"I am disappointed in the BackJoy. Apparently, I already am sitting in the correct position. In my office chair, it pitches my thighs forward, which makes me lean back more. Haven't tried it while driving, yet."
1,Rip Off!!!,Not worth the money....a lousy investment and significantly it does not help with back pain!!!! Tossed into the garbage!!!
5,End of spine pain,A year ago I had back surgery on L4-L5 and it was intended that I would be having another surgery on the tailbone when the first one healed. Meanwhile I sent for 2 BackJoys and kept one in the car and one in my computer chair. After using the 2 Back Joys for a few months I no longer have the tailbone pain. It had been like sitting on a fire cracker for years. Three months ago my husband fractured a vertebra in his lower back. I put my computer chair Back Joy in his recliner. His back has healed well but now he is used to the Back Joy. So I am ordering myself another one for my computer chair as I am beginning to get discomfort again in the tailbone area after not using a Back Joy for a few months.This is a really well worth it product.
1,Don't buy this,This is a scam. The thing did not help back pain and the company was even worse to deal with. Can't return it even if it doesn't work...bad deal
2,Review By A Physical Therapist,"From a physical therapist's standpoint, this product is a good concept - providing lumbar support by stabilizing the pelvis and by taking pressure off the sit bone (ischium). However, I have to say - this product did not meet my expectations.I spend hours at a time doing my progress notes on my computer. I should have a more ergonomic chair, but I don't- so I decided to try this little thing. Tried it for about a week. I really felt no difference at all. I made sure I followed all of the instructions on the ""read first, you'll thank me later"" brochure that came with it. No difference, no significant relief of discomfort.I am returning this one."
1,Great for ONLY 2 weeks,"I was very pleased with the Back Joy for the first two weeks I had it. But, afterward 2 weeks, the front part of the Back Joy that supports the area below my lower thigh no longer provided support. It no longer had stiffness. In theory, your theighs push down the front of the Back Joy and the rear of the Back Joy pushes your hips forward to better align your spine. Without the stiffness it is useless. I am not overly heavy. I weigh 175 lbs. Customer service was less than professional when I discussed this issue."
1,communist filth,"more fascist murderers need 4.5 hour love notes don't you agree? a disgusting effort, on par with exploring jeffrey dahmer's sensitive side."
4,Fascinating,"This was a fascinating movie about Che's Triumph and defeat. I know this movie is not for everyone For some of the reviewers this is not communist propaganda at all. Its account of this man's story. Which is interesting and heroic. But obviously some of you had have your head stuck in the sand talking out of your behind. Calling him murderer for wanting liberate country from a ruthless racist, corrupt brutal puppet of a dictator is absurd considering the atrocities committed by this country within and outside of this boarders. Watch with an open mind. Either way an very interesting story"
4,"Good movie, but something was missing","It was like taking a trip on a time machine. Took me to a different world. I do not know much about Che's life nor about Cuban July Revolution to make any comments about authenticity of historical moments shown in the movie. Benicio Del Toro was superb as Che. He looked like the real guy. I have yet to watch the second part. I myself am from a poor country, and kind of know how power-that-be always tries to maintain class differentials. Che's emphasis on education is based on the simple fact that uneducated are always easier to manipulate. The photography was great and so was the creative combination of black and white as well color photography to create the feeling of visiting two different era.I recommend it."
2,Disappointing.,"Mind you, I was excited to hear about a CHE film in the works.. Though Del Toro doesnt look like Che, I knew his talent would pull it off. And it did very impressively. However, throughtout this marathon of film.. I found myself getting bored and feeling nothing for the characters. It literally felt like we were in the jungle for Days along with them. The flow, character development, musical score was lacking and Ultra Bland at best. As pointed out by others, many key points in Che's life were left out and the stories were not very well put together. Soderberghs' ""experimental"" technique RUINED what could have been an Epic film. In the hands of another director, who knows how great this film would have been. I actually felt sad for Del Toro when I learned about how many years he spent researching/preparing for this role. I think ""Motorcylcle Diaries"" and ""Fidel"" offered more moving portrayals of these men."
1,Communist Propaganda,"Another attempt by social justice (gun point, government take over politics) justification! Communism = murder. Che was an ignorant, short-cited idealist that cost the lives of those who didn't see things as he did. I have no idea how social justice can be used as an excuse to kill inocent people. Anyone who watches this and shares Che's world view should be on a watch list!"
3,CONTAINS DISTURBING PICTURES,"I haven't read much of this book, because it contains images of the most awful thing I have ever seen, the 'death by a thousand cuts'. These pictures still haunt me, and the author uses them, claiming that they are disturbing because they represent somebody who is halfway between being alive and dead - I disagree - they are disturbing because they are scenes of an atrocity inflicted on a living being. (The victim was a woman who allegedly committed adultery in China, I'm not sure when the photos were taken but they look quite old).Those four pictures have destroyed any faith I ever had in human beings, they will probably do the same to you if you are unfortunate enough to ever see them."
2,"No Sugar for me, thanks!","I can't admit I really liked this film although I think Brendan Fehr did a great job with the role as a hustler who befriends a young man who is just coming into his own as a gay man. The story is centered around Cliff (Andre Noble) but it is Fehr's acting that really gets the viewers attention. This film is definitely not for the squeamish. From scenes of sex with an unattractive, overweight disabled woman to a scene where Butch basically rapes Cliff for the benefit of a voyeuristic trick, the movie doesn't shy away from uncomfortable material. Most of the movie, however, just didn't work for me. The role of Cliff's mother wasn't very interesting and I found the little sister, Cookie, who pill-popped Ritalin and dispensed joints like candy to be a little creepy. Noble did fairly well with his role but I wasn't impressed with him overall. The main reason to watch this is Brendan Fehr's performance----otherwise, not worth recommending."
2,Forgettable & disappointing & dumb,"Young queer skyrocketing out of the closet develops an infatuation for a stupid loser/druggie/boy-whore, with predictable and stupid consequences. Both boys receive serious rue from the clue canoe.Sugar's not half as titillating or erotic as you might suppose based on their flesh comingling on the bed in the cover art. Instead it's a journey through the dark, dank caves of El Depresso.The boys are cute, and act competently; they might have been presented a better script, written by a sober writer. I don't want to see anymore movies about gays on drugs having lousy sex and sad lives."
3,"Great JO Scene, but a little slow",The film was well done and easy to follow with not a lot to make one ponder. I guess that is to be expected with a movie about a drug addicted male prostitute and his groupie. Worth seeing if you like that kind of thing.

4,just as described,i love the show the 4400 and this cd is just as cool. i love the theme song and the fact that switchfoot has a song on here is even better!
2,Really enjoyed the first 1/3,"I did this book as a read-aloud with my girlfriend. I really enjoyed the first 1/3 of the book, but by the end I was quite tired of it. The Cardinal is essentially a Catholic melodrama."
5,Battery,"The batteries work well, of course. The only issue is how long the battery lasts and how expensive it is, neither of which is Amazon's issue."
2,Love the Petsafe system but batteries don't last long....,"I have a cat with ATTITUDE! The above ground Petsafe Cat system has saved our expensive living room furniture. But....like everyone else the batteries only last about 1 month each. Small price to pay for saving thousands of $$$$ of furniture.However, thanks to others who have reviewed these batteries I was able to pry the top off and buy the Sanyo CR1/3N lithium batteries and now I get a whole year of batteries for less than than the cost of a couple of these RFA-188. batteriesandbutter.com has them for around $1.25 each (when I order 12)."
2,Bad battery,I have 2 dogs wearing these and they do not test the fence often. The batteries last less than a month. They are expensive and should be considered along with the purchase price of the fence as part of the overall cost. My only complaint is that it is less battery than the other petsafe collars and it costs more. $10 is excessive.
3,The Saturn Mythology,"Mr. Talbott has researched this book well, but his interpretation is that Saturn was once revolving around the Sun in Earth`s orbit. From the standpoint of planetary physics, this could not have happened. The graphic symbols in question most likely represent the Earth revolving around its crystalline inner core. This is still a book well worth reading for the documentation of historical artifacts."
1,"difficult to assemble, poor quality","I never write reviews but was compelled to for this due to its cost andd outrageously poor design. It took two guys (both trained in engineering) 2 days to get assembly right. The instructions were barely helpful. Once built, the front wheels were not parallel and adjustment for this is not possible. So the car looks great but doesn't drive (and when pushed it begins to come apart due to bad design). This is worse than frustrating when your[...]and his friends are dying to use it. Don't go near this product."
3,You have to ask the right questions...,"Occasionally interesting, but mostly disappointing, this book seems to be the result of interviews in which the right questions were not asked. Even interviewees who in other contexts have had a lot to say for themselves came across as tongue-tied. Read _Beyond Risk_ instead."
4,This is a must read for all Christians,Bishop Spong has once again presented us with an opportunity to free ourselves from the bondage of the fundamentalists. He challenges us to think and to claim our own faith. As I took the first few tentative steps into this book I was not sure if I could continue but soon I was fascinated with what I was reading. Spong reveals the bible in a new light that clearly provides new thinking to go beyond the ancient interpretations we have accepted for so long. This is a must read for anyone brave enough to think and brave enough to change.
1,Spong does it again,"The ineffable Spong has done it again. Is it having a name that sounds like Clinton's private description of the male organ of generation that makes him so weird?Before you read Spong read ""Elmer Gantry"""
1,Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism,"I feel extremely sorry for you. You serve a weak, stupid god. He cannot even write a book about himself. Good luck!"
1,Just one question...?,"Why is this guy still a bishop? I have a hard time believing he's even a Christian, let alone why he is supposed to be a church leader. Next thing we know, he's going to be telling us how the believers of Hinduism are believe in the same God as Christians and that they have a similar theology. Remember, just because the Bible lists events that are less than savory (lets face it, who gets encouraged by war and destruction), it is important to keep in mind that the Bible is also a historical record (read, just because it talks about something does not mean that it condones what happened, but rather it just tells you it happens). It is my suggestion that Bishop Sprong rethink why exactally he calls himself a Christian (along with all those in agreement with his ideas)."
3,"what interesting ideas of ""i do don't i ""","what interesting ideas of ""i do, don't i ""i would like to know ,can anyone tell me please~~"
1,Outdated,Most of the activities in this book are outdated. The websites don't even exist anymore. What a waste!
2,its helpful,"I FOUND GOOD THINGS IN THE BOOK ,BUT IT IS NOT SURPRISING OR AMAZING INFORMATION, I WILL JUST SAY"" GOOD"""
3,"Still not all long versions, but there are some:","You get some club versions on here: glad to know you (6:45), Love Come Down (6:19), Megatron Man (7:31), Cheri (6:36), Right on Target (6:20), and So Fine (5:34). The rest are single versions.This series should have gone for the gusto and put all extended versions, considering it's celebrating dance music."
2,Revisionist History,"This book was written as tutor teaching history. The writing was dry between the tutor and student but the story part, the ""history"" was well written. Unfortunately, the history part is at best only partially correct or flat out incorrect. It was an interesting read to see how some people wish to portray history without having to back up the facts because this is a fiction book and not a history book. Very clever, to have people read this and believe that this is how events unfolded."
3,never ever again,"sorry Dwayne, but this book was so not all that hot. It was about these women that were so bent behind men.. i mean they were so dumb i had to ask my self what the #@&* am i reading this for? these were some stupid stupid... women in my opinion... if a man is treating u wrong move the hell on. this book made me upset because the characters were so weak. it wasn't horrible but it wasn't that great either."
3,"Enough, already!","Well written, characters nicely fleshed-out. But dark. Very, very dark. Not a shred of humor or levity anywhere. Ne relief from the suffering of all the characters. Another story of lives rent and ravaged by AIDS and other cruel twists of fate. How many of these can we read? For those who have not experienced ""the life,"" this is, however, an excellent keyhole through which to view it. But I imagine there are few ""uninitiates"" who will read, much less purchse, such a novel. I fear it's more ""preaching to the choir."" Currier's style is engaging, but the protagonist is so mired in self-pity that it becomes difficult to empathize after a point. Perhaps writing this was cathartic for Currier, and perhaps his next offering will be more satisfying, because he IS a great writer. Check it out from a library because it's unlikely you'll want a second read."
3,"Fun, but not enough bang for the buck","The clues are plenty challenging and even tricky, chosen from a wide variety of subjects and levels of expertise, but the quotes at the end are not as interesting as in other acrostics I have done. They are taken mostly from popular humor books or self-help books or celebrity bios. I would rather see meatier quotes from history and science books or essays, or actual quotes from historical figures or documents like the Declaration of Independence. Too often I find that I have the quote figured way too soon and then it is a tedious job to go back and fill in the (almost impossible) clue words I couldn't guess. It would be nice if the quotes were longer and taken from more interesting sources to make them more difficult to guess. The puzzles are still fun, but the payoff at the end (finding out the quote) is too often a letdown."
2,Beginner,Left it up over night got a lot of spot rust. Hard to keep feet in straps. Cable is hard to get pins through the ends. Does climb nice.
3,as gentle as a wendy craig burp.,"What a wonderful film all about these delightful creatures of the outer zones. it's nice to watch them in there natural habitat, rather than have then buzzing in my face.I thank my furry rear every morning that i live in a city, where none of these pesky beasts live. It would be better rated if they had a section on how to exterminate them - guess that will be in the follow-up title.Do you think this guy gets out much from his wooden shed in the forest? I reckon there are secret things hidden under his floorboards and these creatures feed on them!Oh and there is some bald man grinning on the cover to scare people - worked for me."
4,Definitely a must have....,"I love Pato....he's great live, and this is a very solid representation of what he brings to the stage. Pato is one of the most inspirational and uplifting reggae stars on the planet, and this is an absolute must have. The crowd seems a little small (and somewhat passive), and some of the video production isn't that fantastic, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Love it....,I got this at my shower and I think it is a great gift. Being a first time mother it can in very helpful I would def. recommend it. In fact I bought one for a friend who is also going to be a new mom! Would have got 5 stars if it came with a bigger mylicon.
1,this book is crap,This book is nothing more than a sale of christianity. I can't believe i wasted my money on this garbage it has very little to do with actual secret societies.
1,Kickaroos,This was a Birthday present for my active 10 year old Grandson. He loved them the first few days but then has pretty much put them aside. Does not seem that they have enough bounce to make it exciting for him to put them back on.
2,Terrible,"These are such a rip off! For the price, I could have gotten a much nicer gift for my grandchildren. I totally agree with the review that says they are just big clunky shoes. The gravity part is about 6 inches off the ground! Even though the kids asked for these, if I had known this was all there was to them, I would NEVER have bought!"
5,"A ""Feel Good"" Book",This book was very inspirational. I have recommended it to all my co-workers and friends. I learned so much from it that will help me to be a better person and not stress out so much about what others think. It gave me confidence to reach my goals and not let anything get in my way.
4,4 out of 5 ain't bad!!,"This CD has a collection of what's supposed to be one of the best Romantic Ballads in the music.. The bands there, well most of them are now out of date.. but some are still giving to the music industry.. The music there is great, as to be of the old ballads that can never be forgotten.. more likely a collectors edition for those who like romantic rock melodies.. i recommend this CD as a gift to an older person, or someone who really needs to hear some REAL good music!!"
1,Not worth the cost!,"Tried this device after good reviews. I definitely do NOT recommend to anyone!! Take your tire to a gas station or any reputable mechanic to do a patch job for $15-20. This product is trash. I am a DIYer and it sounds simple enough but it does not work. Ended up using all 3 plugs in the kit and tire still leaked (a bit slower) but still leaking tire after using the product. I had a nail which I removed, heard the air rushing out, followed the directions, and lost 2 of 3 plugs in the tire. The 3rd plug did not ""catch"" as described and basically was a piece of ""chewing gum"" stuck over the hole in the tire. At least it was a fairly inexpensive lesson to date and my tires only have about 5-10k left on them."
2,Leak plugged but still leaking,I had a simple nail puncture and plugged it with one Dynaplug. It continued a slow leak so put another plug in the hole. It still leaked. I took the tire and wheel to a professional tire store where it was repaired with a patch on the inside of the tire. After a week or more of usage it has retained the tire pressure and now believe it is good. I think the Dynaplug is ok for a temperary fix but is too porous for a no leak long term repair.
1,Really disappointed,"Purchased these tire repair plugs for my motorcycle. Lucky for me I was at home when I first used them.Basically, the sticky plug did not insert into the puncture far enough to prevent air from leaking out when the tire was inflated. The metal point went in after some hard pushing and turning. Seemed that the hole made by the roofing nail was smaller than the tool diameter.I tried 3 times using new plugs and each time following the directions. Finally, I was able to push the third plug in further than the tool had, enough to stop air from leaking.Now going to have the shop put a patch on the inside of the tire because I do not trust the plug.I have had better luck with the plugs you fold in half and center on the tool then insert, twist and pull the tool out, leaving the plug in the tire."
4,good cookbook,"beautifully produced book, excellent photographs. Very enjoyable to read. Interesting recipes, most require a fair amount of attention and time just prior to serving. Might be a little difficult timing for some dinner parties."
3,"A mixture of Elvis, Nat and Ben E. King","This is a Rhino collection of a silky & smooth soul-singing pioneer that I knew very little about. His voice is a mixture of Elvis, Nat and Ben E. King. Between 1959 (It's Just A Matter of Time) to 1970 (Rainy Night in Georgia) he had 16 top 40 hits, of which 8 went Top Ten! This 20 song collection also includes two hit duets with Dinah Washington and his biggest hit, The Boll Weevil Song. But for my money, this collection could have been so much better if the early songs didn't have the corny string arrangements attached to them, a successful ploy in the 50's and early 60's to help R&B crossover to a white audience."
3,Great stories but not for toddlers.,"I am not familiar with the story lines and got this DVD for my toddler because she loves Calico Critters. It turned out that there are a couple of scary looking 'bad guys' in every story. My little one got scared and we stopped watching the DVD. I guess I will wait till she is older to try this DVD again. I enjoyed the stories; each have a good moral behind it. Overall, I would recommend this to Calico Critter funs that are over 5 years old."
4,Good fit on even tiny dogs but requires liner,"I have a tiny (3.5 lb) dog who sprays everything all the time, even immediately after going outside. I find that this diaper was the most effective for this tiny dog who has a very large...er...member! The diaper is reasonably wide and the fit is solid because of the elastic. The velcro is very secure which dissuades my little guy from removing it. The product has three drawbacks: it holds very little liquid alone and is NOT waterproof, so you must use it with a liner. I find that a long feminine product with ""wings"" works the best. Also, the diaper looks ridiculous with its saggy appearance. Silly-looking or not, it does the trick and my drapes are thankful!"
3,diapers,"did not match up to the sizing guide on back of product. good price and good product in all. I did return the product, didn't appreicayte the inconvenice."
2,too small,"I have a small(30lbs) dog and these diapers, even in the xlarge, simply do not fit....way too small and tight. I've tried all kinds of dog diapers ....none work. The dog is 19 years old with arthritis and leaking is a problem..sometimes the other also. MY SOLUTION...buy Xlarge human baby diapers and strap them to his shoulders and back with VERY LIGHT velcro strips....it works....is cheaper, can be changed more often, fits...and the dog doesn't seem to mind them"
2,Old formula was much better,The old formula was much better. Even the old brush supplied was better. I still use the old brush. I need to use this product twice a week. I use it Monday and Thursday morning before going to work. It does not have staying power. I also use it to touch up my head hair roots. I find the tube does not have much product and I need to buy it frequently. Also the product goes on my skin and I need to use alcohol pads to get the stains off. The product is not very good but this is what is out there just for men.
1,Not 1.2 GHz as stated on website. It is 2.4 GHz!!!,Pedi de 1.2 GHz y envio uno de 2.4 GHz.Esto es mala fe pues el proveedor sabe que no tiene de 1.2 y no informa.
1,waste of money,"even from 5 feet away images are barely visible. The receiver uses an adjustment knob to fine tune the video, which it never did, and also means you would not be able to use the camera on an exisiting 4 channel receiver."
3,Its okay,Its not crystal clear but acceptable for non professional useThe range is not so much like 13 meters At most
5,Cool little Camera,i recieved my camera today. i purchsed mine before i read the reviews and i'm glad i did not. my cameera works perfact. i have none of the problem others are. i'm planning to buy one more
1,Not Durable,This product may be suitable for kids under 10 years old. My son is 14 years old and can throw a baseball at 70 MPH. The first pitch tore the stitching. I do not recommend this product for older children.
5,Great Toy!,"My 2 year old daughter adores JoJo and this talking doll was her favorite birthday present; she loves anything JoJo! The doll is a nice size and the talking feature is not too loud; I wish there was an on/off button feature though, so she could sleep with JoJo! A great product!"
2,Looks like elf shoes!,"These boots looked great in the photos. When I received it and tried it on, I just had to laugh at myself. I looked like I was an elf! The toes are way too pointy! A lot more pointy than the stock photos show! What a disappointment, because I loved how the top half looked."
4,Nice tripod,Been a while since I bought this tripod. Changed the 3 way for a ball head.Still going strong.Doesn't come with a bag/case to carry it in so had to buy a separate one.
5,what its about,Description. Crochet patterns for beautiful afghans with shell titles. Sizes range about 49 X 67 inches. Full colored photos of each finished product. Leisure Arts put together a lovely collection. 26 pages.1. Shells Upon Shells2. Pebbles and Shells3. Framed Shells4. Seascape5. Shells in a Basket6. Tidal Flow7. Dreams of Shells8. Flowing Shells9. Shells in a net10. Sand and Shells11. Ocean Waqves12. Shell Wave
5,Camp Chef Camp Table,This is wonderful. I am older and bending down to work with my dutch ovens has been difficult. This table gets them up where I can work with them easily. Great concept. Most helpful.
5,"CRISP, clear and toasty ( 5 stars )","Mike Clark deserves all the high rating everyone is giving him. He explains his material bit by bit and mixes in real world practical experience. Fantastic stuff! Definitely a learning experience without the struggles. You will get a great understanding of the hows/whys/what of automated builds. Very thorough stuff. Along the way, he comfortably steps you through Ant, Cruise Control and see what its all about. If you like easy gentle reads with clear explanations, this book is for you. If you want to get a good overview of automating a java development environment, this is it."
3,Technically good but not to my taste,It seemed to me that he performed in a playful and idiosynchratic style rather than the more hammer-and-anvil approach I expected. Some variations far too fast for my taste. I much prefer Serkin.
2,Very hard to understand,"It is a book not so good, expecially the part talking about device drivers. Too few examples and too abstract. It doesn't teach you so much, on the contrary, it only shows you the source of the kernel without too much explanations."
4,Worth to buy,"I love this book.I would treat it as a reference book. The books contains enough content about kernel, but the worst one is lack of examples.Also, I would love the index of those system calls at the back of the book"
4,Decent,"This book is quite adequate to get down to kernel hacking. There are certain things missing in this book, but it makes a good starting point -- I wouldn't call it a great starting point, though. If you have a background of the Unix Kernel, this book will be easier to get along with."
2,not the best,"This has got to be the hardest 'gel' I have seen.. I was hoping this seat was going to allow me to ride without using bike shorts.. But no, I still need the shorts, even after a couple of miles."
5,Great Bicycle Seat,"I am a 5'6"" 120 lb. female. The seat that came with my Giant bicycle caused pain in my hip and down my leg after a short time of riding. I purchased the Schwinn Pillowtop at Target after reading good reviews about it but it did not work for me either. The ridges in the seat were very uncomfortable, and the nose of the seat was too thick causing rubbing. I decided to try the Sunlite Cloud-9 Comfort Gel for Ladies, and it was definitely a keeper. It didn't perfectly fit the clamps on my bicycle, but my husband was able to squeeze it into the grooves with one of his tools. The Sunlite provides comfort for as long as I ride, and no pain afterward. I am a person who rides no more than 5 miles at a time. I would definitely recommend this seat to anyone in my size range."
4,Happy derrière!,"Most comfortable bike seat I've found so far. Not perfect, but I can ride 20+ miles without being miserable as I was with the hard seat that came on the bike. Have even purchased a second of these Cloud-9's for an old bike I keep at a beach cottage; great improvement in the ride there, too! Would recommend."
5,GOOD STUFF!!,"merchandise was all there and in good condition, timely delivery and overall extreamly satisfactory."
2,Psychobabble without substance.,"If you need someone to encourage you to write then you may like this. If you are a writer looking to expand their technical knowledge you will find it useless. I felt like a grade school teacher was patting me on the head saying, ""you can do it!""There's also some babble about dreams and nightmares and fears...... All baloney. If I was looking for this kind of misinformation I'd buy something by Freud.I paid 1.99 for this book during an Amazon sunday deal, I paid too much."
2,USB problems - bad customer support,"The camera is okay, and the pictures are okay, but I've had to return two of them because the USB/downloading feature from the camera stopped working. Customer support is bad - after 90 days they want to charge me [alot of] dallars to fix it - this is for labor (one year warranty covers just parts). There seems to be a problem with this feature - I wish I did my research beforehand - I would have never purchased this camera."
1,please make your descritive text accurate!,"the ""features"" say 0ptical zoom 8x while the picture show a 2x lens.Don't buy anything whose description is not accurate."
1,Screen went Black too!,"We have had the camera for about 18 months and now the screen keeps going Black whenever it feels the need. Also, the flash goes off several times before taking the photo so my photo subjects ALWAYS move before the photos is taken. I strongly do not recommend this camera."
3,good,good book with a couple of great ideas inside. not much for explaining technique but the designs are cute if you are not a novice.
2,It's ok,"This book is ok, but I wouldn't buy more books unless they are American, cos I don't understand their measurements and they call everything differently. In overall the book has very good designs."
1,SCAM!!!,"10,000 fonts? Uh, yeah. The ones that AREN'T renamed and repackaged fonts already found on my system from the factory are WEAK! When I think ""new"" fonts, I want something NEW! In my estimate, they have based almost their ENTIRE fonts list from about 5 (not so) different styles. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,LISTEN to these reviews!,"I didn't pay full-price for this CD and I still feel ripped off. There are not 10,000 fonts in this CD - there are 10,000 IMAGES. Each character is being counted. And if you're looking for fonts to oh, say, write a letter or document with, forget it. The fonts are for titles - big letters, not small. I was looking for additional fonts to enhance my journaling in my scrapbooks...this did nothing for me except suck up space from my hard drive."
5,THE history of the Eastern Front,"Great book.Written in the style of Cornelius Ryan -- personal accounts mixed with historical overview and critical opinion by the author.While biased from the German point of view, it is far more objective than typical (and questionably accurate) Soviet histories. It does give scant recognition to Soviet soldiery and tactics, preferring to attribute Soviet victories to overwhelming numbers. While somewhat accurate, it regrettably misses probably the greatest irony of the war -- that Soviet and German military doctrine between 1941 to 1945 did a flip-flop -- Soviets evolved from following disastrous defensive strategy into masters of the Blitzkrieg, while the Germans went in the exact reverse direction.The book accurately portrays the horror and hell of the Eastern Front from the standpoint of the average German ""grunt"", while providing an solid strategic examination of the war."
4,Great Book,I am Eastern Front buff and have over 50 books on the Eastern Front alone and this is one of them. This book is part 2 of his first book Hitler Moves East 1941-1943 and like the first it is hard to put down once you start reading it. Carrell makes you feel like you are fighting along side them. You need to add this one and his first one Hitler Moves East. to your collection. You can't go wrong. Great reading.
3,Good Service,Went on vacation and came back to my item waiting.Good servicePrompt and professional.Thanks
5,Absolutely Fantastic,This is by far one of the most entertaining DVDs - these guys are incredible - amazing voices - great stage presence - an amazing show - wish I could have been there.
2,Licking,"I got this bottle for my newborn baby. And I was very disappointed because it is licking a lot of times. I mentioned that when I warm the milk and give it to my baby, the bottle is licking from the side and my baby was all wet. Never buy it again."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Once again I find myself paying premium price thinking I'm getting a quality product. Instead, I get something made in China that would look right at home at the local discount mart. First, the term ""Amber"" needs to be taken with a grain of salt when referring to the plastic (not glass as advertised)globes. I would say it is at best lightly tinted, and when I turn the lights on, I can barely perceive any color at all. Total string length is a farce. I would have to buy at least six of these just to stretch around my 11 x 14' townhouse deck. You would be better off buying a ""throw away"" string of lights for $15."
4,Gets the crud!,"I needed a new vac, and frankly bought this one because it was a good deal and had decent reviews.I am SO HAPPY with this machine. My daughter is very allergic to dust and we also have 4 cats...I had spent the day before my new vac arrived cleaning her room literally from ceiling to floor for 2 1/2 hours. When my new yellow friend arrived, I thought I'd see how good it was and re-did her floor. I was amazed at what it collected, and with the fact that nothing blows back out into the room. My carpets are only a year old, but never looked ""freshly vacumed"". They do now, and the fluff and clean stays for days instead of hours.Plus, this puppy goes completely flat to clean under tables, etc and the back saver handle really does make a difference ( I have 6 herniated discs in my spine and usually suffer a lot when Ivacume.) Do not hesitate if you are thinking of purchasing this machine. It is an incredible deal."
5,"""The Father of Mobile Robotics"" validates his title here !!","In this tour de force, John M. Holland serves up a feast that should be both didactic and entertaining to engineering professors and neophyte-technophiles alike. His wit and wisdom are generously shared in ways that are both lucid and compelling. His personal parables are not only entertaining but beautifully illustrative of even the most arcane of his topics. And John balances cautionary tales with an abiding conviction that service robots will eventually have a huge presence in both private industrial and governmental applications."
5,The illiustrated encyclopidia of Fairies,This is a wonderful book. Comprehensive guide to Fairies around the worldthe artwork is beautiful. I would recomend this volume to anyone interested in an in depth study of the fairy folk.It is impressive to say the least.
3,Good enough...,"I learned about these writings through a website I frequent and found this book for sale here. The writings are of the time. They are complicated to understand sometimes, easy to follow other times, and overall through provoking and deep all the way through. Read a little bit, let it sink in and fester, have stimulating conversations with people....repeat process.The book is made to order. You submit your order, then the book is created and shipped. I prefer hard backed books because they make you feel like you have something in your hands that you need to pay attention to not something that you can just toss around and come back to it when you need it. This book is paperback and is slightly more than a pamphlet that you'd read at a golf store.I could not find these writings in hard cover, so I'd recomend just getting them from Project Gutenburg for your e-reader or some website."
4,"Durable, comfortable, safe","Avent is a great manufacturer. My son is ill and has been on bottles for two years. He's just now starting to wear out the 6 month old nipples. The bottles hold 9 oz., are stable (wide instead of tall!) and are very comfortable to handle (use the 4 oz. bottles for smaller babies)."
4,OLD MOVIES WITH AN ACTUAL THEME,"I FELT CURIOUS ABOUT THE TITLE SO I BOUGHT THE MOVIE AND WATCHED IT COMPLETELY. IT IS AN OLD SUBJECT AND THIS IS NO NEW MOVIE BUT THE ACTING IS FINE AND THE GUY LOOKS THE PART.I THINK THAT FOR THE PRICE, YOU GET PLENTY OF ENTERTAINMENT!"
1,Will not install using XP,I could not get Calendar Creator 9 to install on my Dell using Windows XP.
2,Not Worth The Money,"I expected to get more than I did for the cost. The black and white artwork in it is great but for the small amount of graphics that you get with the set it's just not worth it. Great artwork, I just expected more for the cost."
5,"The Next ""Good to Great""","This terrific book clearly demonstrates how great companies achieved greatness - financially and socially - by taking on some of the world's worst problems. It defies critics who still contend that social responsibility is unrelated to business performance, and sets a higher standard that made me expect more, not only from my business, but from other companies that I support. It's one of the best books I've read this year."
2,Absolutely Terrible!!! :(,"After reading the great reviews, I decided to purchase this movie as I absolutely love a good scare. Not only was this movie not scary AT ALL, it was downright boring, predictable, and somewhat laughable. There was just so much wasted potential and honestly the visuals were not gory or scary enough to match the marketing and expectations. Instead of buying this, look for ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" or even ""Cinderella""."
4,I just wish the interior color was lighter.,"This is an awesome little bag. I carry no other. Everything I need fits right in. I wear a backpack for my health, you should too. I just wish the interior color was not black also.January 23, 2013 I am still carrying this bag everyday, it still looks nice!"
3,OK but not great,"The hole on these nipples is not always punched in the middle, and some was way off. I recommend order Dr. Brown's nipples over these."
4,as specified,"these are nipples... as advertised in size. nothing more to say.. the ""BPA free"" is a bit of BS because soft plastic like this rarely has BPA (it's hard, clear, plastic that you have to watch for)..."
2,nothing special,For a Newborn Nipple it flows very fast. Specially for a BRAND that prompts its self as being close to breastfeeding which this is nothing close to. Go with NUK bottles they are great and iv used many kinds to find one that I/ my son liked.
1,Hit and miss with leaking. Update: Junk,"The avent system is designed to not totaly seal to the bottle so it can vent through the ring instead of through the holes at the business end of the nipple. They sort of relyed on the fact that you can make something liquid tight but not air tight. The problem with this is when you are shaking the bottle in order to mix the formula with the water 50% of the time you will have a leak. Also when you tilt the bottle to put it in your childs mouth you will sometimes have a small gush of milk from the ring.I have tried several different things to prevent this. i have assembled it wet, dry, tightly, loosely, moderately, etc. but i cant seem to find a pattern with the leaking, they just leak sometimes. This is especially annoying in the middle of the night.Update: We have been having extreme issues with these bottles/nipples. The either leak or don't vent or leak or don't vent etc. We will never buy these bottles again. And we will never recommend them."
1,Save your money,"Do yourself a favor and save some money. If your old nipples don't seem to have enough flow for your baby anymore, get a needle and make a few more holes into it. If still not enough, make a few more OR make a couple with a hot needle. That is all it takes."
4,Good flow for babies who are both bottle fed and breast fed,"These are very durable nipples. They've withstood numerous washings/sterilizing and they maintained their appearance and function. The Slow flow is a good flow for babies that are both bottle fed and breast fed. These nipples fit the original Avent bottles not the newer Avent Natural Flow bottles. These were good for a few weeks until we inadvertently bought the new Avent Natural Flow bottles. Since we were stuck with our purchase, we tried it and now our baby wouldn't go back to these."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this product. This software is garbage. It is archaic software with a crude, inflexible, disorganized user interface. It was next to impossible to get this software to print correctly. I tried it on HP, NEC, and Cannon printers and it has never worked correctly. Broderbund customer support is unable to offer any useful assistance. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Creatacard Platinum Version 7,"Dont buy this software. It appears to have alot of card templates on the package; but when you open it, you have to connect to the internet to get most of the cards and then you have to download them to your hard drive. It is extemely annoying to have the ""do you want to connect to the internet"" keep popping up all the time. Save your money. Buy another greeting card software that actually has the cards on the disk you buy and not the internet."
2,displeased,"lots of items to choose from ,,but almost everytime you are directed to the website,,,very annoying"
1,Would suggest not buying this product......,"I didn't like this product and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone else.I purchased the Platinum 5 sometime back and really loved it and about wore it out using it so decided to upgrade to the Platinum 7. Boy, was I surprised. Most of their art can only be used by having to be online. Even the art that was on the Platinum 5 can only be gotten now by being online using the Platinum 7. I travel alot and can't be online always so this American Greetings Platinum 7 is really worthless to me.I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this. It doesn't tell you either on packageing that you have to be online to be able to use alot of their art. To me this is unfair, not knowing .So please do not buy this product."
2,New york times book of wines.,Your book hardly mentions minerals but your bi-weekly tasters evaluations in the dining section of your newspaper indicate that they are of extreme importance. Your book does not help me in answering this question. To me minerals are what we find in rocks and their taste is not very pleasant.
1,A good house or backyard Toy,"I bought this with the hope of using it for wildlife observations while out in the field. I had previous experience with night vision and hoped for a clear view of the surrounding meadows, forests, etc. Not so with this one. I could not see any better than using my own eyes. It works when there is still some light or moonlight but, I can see fine on my own then. I returned it after one use.It works ok in the house or your local backyard, as it will pick up the street lights etc and make everything bright. Forget it if you intend to use it in the wilderness.The technology has definately improved in this area but for a good product it appears I will have to spend more money. I'll eat carrots for now."
5,the black lips,This album rules im a metal fan but this is great rock and roll with the old school sound you will love this.This band has the sounds from the 70's if you like them you will like this.
5,Jura Coffee maker supplies,"Buying the descaling tablets for our Capresso/Jura coffee maker in bulk, instead of in the blister pack of 6 helped reduce cost per tablet substantially as well as the cost of fethching them every 6-8 months. No Hassle if you think you will need the tablets for 3 or so years."
2,Not a good place to start in the series...,"Probably I'll pick up another of Ann Ripley's books because I like gardening and because she lives just up the road here in Colorado. But truthfully, I was not able to make it past the first 60 pages of this book. The characters seemed wooden, the premise of the plot seemed completely implausible, and the writing itself had me sighing for better editing. Why all of two stars? Because I could see the possibilities, at least, even if they seemed woefully unrealized. There's much more and better to read, and I'm going to move along now."
1,Save your Money !,"I bought this program for the sole purpose of creating a few personalized calendars for Christmas gifts - it has proven to be a waste of time and money.It is not very user friendly and there is not much online support. I wasn't trying to do anything fancy - just a simple calendar and I gave up trying to figure it out. It also crashed my new Windows XP computer a few times.I would not recommend this software - I have since created my calendar with Microsoft Publisher's Calendar wizard. I wish I had tried that first ...... oh well, live and learn."
2,Neglectable and untasty repertoire even unsaved by the great Cesar Camargo Mariano,"Cesar Camargo Mariano has always been a reference as arranger to Brazilian vocalists through the last 30 years. Elis Regina, Leny Andrade, Nana Caymmi, Leila Pinheiro, Maria Martha, Nara Leao, Fafa de Belem, and even Gal Costa have counted on his creative arrangements.Deception here comes from the fact that this is the first time that not even the sensitive sound of Mr. Mariano has saved a music program from a bore tour of more than 10 tracks.Not even fresh new material by Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque brings relief."
3,Good Guide for a BAD exam,I read the book and I found many errors on it but I don't blame Hery for that.The Exam itself has a lot of errors you should be careful.I toke the exam one time and I failed.I read the Sadat Malik book and is great and acurate (maybe to acurate for this exam).You have to learn the right way and the exam way. :(
2,Disappointed,"The only value of this book is to give you an idea what to prepare for the exam, and this is the reason I brought it. I have read many Cisco press books and this one is the most disappointed. The book itself does not explain the topics well and as a CCIE myself I found many errors & inaccurate information inside, much more than any other Cisco books I read.My advice is to use this book only for the exam but not and never as a future reference."
1,"Henry, please return your CCIE plaque(s)","I'm a R&S; CCIE, but have been working on security for the last 6 years. As I have to go thru my recert, decided to go with the security written exam.I had read the reviews for this book before buying it - including the one from bam - but decided to give it a try - heck, is from CiscoPress, who gave us the Routing TCP/IP vol I and II - how bad can this one be?Easy: it isn't bad. It is WORSE. Period. No excuses. I read the book in about 8 hours, and I have to admit that after reading 1/2 of it, I felt sorry for whoever is preparing the written CCIE exam and actually uses this books. There's hardly one page (no kidding) without an error. Not talking about syntax errors - talking about conceptual errors, half digested ideas.I want my money back - this books actually deserves -1 stars. I had to skip thru the whole IPSec section - I was afraid I was actually going to remember any of it, and totally wreck what I knew.Stay away from this book."
5,The Little Burro!,"When I was little I watched a VHS copy of the Little Brown Burro over and over again. My poor parents. Now I'm excited to find it so I can let my children torture me the same way!All kidding aside though the music is catchy and the main story, the tale of the little brown burro everyone was mean to is fun. Of course there is a moral and the poor burro whose only friend was a singing rat ends up being the burro that carries Mary to the stable where she gives birth. That is a small part though of such a bigger fun story. Its sort of a Christmas Tale of the Ugly Duckling."
5,"Good price, works well.","I used to buy Brakleen at the local parts store, but I needed a bunch of it recently, and the price here is better. Since it's made by Permatex, I wasn't surprised that it is just as good. The spray nozzle even seems a little better, since it is larger and I think holds the straw better.Also, this contains about 50% acetone, which means it can melt/cloud some paints and plastics, so be careful with the over-spray."
4,burned by the brand-new snow.,"possibly the most stunning piece of contemplative, universal art-folk since Drake's _Pink Moon_, Bonfire Madigan's Kill Rock Stars debut _...From The Burnpile_ paints a bitter, hopeful, and unusually danceable view of modern queer life. The sort of disc you'd want to hear in the vintage shop on the other side of town that you never get a chance to go to until finally you do and find the perfect $10 shirt. Highly reccomended."
1,She is no Jen Wood,"Sorry ya'll. My opinion of this record is not a good one. I didn't necessarily expect it to be like Jen Wood's solo stuff, but this other half of ""Tattle Tale"" is severely lacking melody and that ol' thing called ""pitch"". There a couple of good tunes, but most of the disc is hard edged and hard to listen to. Check out Jen Wood's ""Getting Past the Static"" It is a totally different experience."
4,Good book to have for Wing Chun artists,"Although this book demonstrates the advanced form of WIng Chun, it is still useful for the student who hasn't attained the skill to learn the form. Cheung shows proper execution of bil jee, and shows some other wing chun strikes and blocks. Briefly discusses wing chun combat theory, and some other principles. Good showing of the form, though don't expect to be able to execute the form exactly without a qualified instructor. Cheung then goes on to show some entry techniques that I've never seen and I question their effectiveness. Ends with a chapter on bil jee applications. Cheung includes a letter to him from Lee Jun Fan, for some reason, maybe for a sales booster, but the letter is irrelevant to the books purpose. I also don't know why he chose to write about the advanced form of wing chun first, and then go onto to write books covering more of the basics, it seems backwards, but hey I'm not Grandmaster Cheung."
4,I'm surprised... (minor spoiler),"that all those schools turned Allegra down, her being from the prominent family she's from! Maybe the schools weren't really right for her, but I guess I assumed some would have done cartwheels (and made some adjustments) for the privilege of having a Ford in their school."
5,Great book on the importance of marriage,"This is one of the best books I've read about the importance of marriage. This book doesn't give tips on how to improve your marriage, but talks about how marriage is necessary for individuals, families and for society. It also talks about the declining birth rates and the problems that is causing. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more on how marriages are important."
2,worked well for awhile........,"loved this coffee pot at first, looked great, produced good coffee. However, started leaking h2o out the bottom of the coffeepot and then the hot pad wouldn't shut off and the unit had to be unplugged when not in use or it would stay on all day/night. this happened within a year of purchase but was not covered by warranty."
1,BROKE AFTER 4 MONTHS!!!,"After seeing the reviews, I'm actually impressed that the machine actually worked longer than 4 months for most people. It brewed coffee fine, but could have had this with any cheap machine that probably would have worked much longer. The KRUPS name is pretty much meaningless."
3,Loved this coffeemaker...but it RUSTED!,"I'm 50/50 on this coffemaker....I loved it for the last year and a half (yes it was only a very short time), I used it daily and what others said about the burner coroding and rusting is true. It started to rust and I unfortunately have to buy a new coffeemaker to replace it, even though I will say it makes FANTASTIC coffee. Truly sad to say goodbye to my Krups, not sure which brand to turn to from here!"
3,Early morning user unfriendly,"Easy set-up, decent coffee. My only complaint is the carafe does not slide back in smoothly if you leave the basket in and I'm not ready to deal with it until I've had at least two cups."
2,Unhappy,"I have had this product just over a year. It appeared to be shut off and when I came home from work it was still on and the pot was charred. Now it will not shut off. I have to unplug it to get it to shut off. Beware. My last Krups I had for 10yrs with no complaints! This one, not so much."
1,Artsy Ideas - But Few Specifics,"This book was a big disappointment to me. If you want to get some great ideas on creating funky - artsy frames then you should consider it.However, if you want instuctions on how to make mats and frames in an afternoon (as the title would suggest) then look elsewhere.The instructions on measuring and calculating mats sizes are cursory. The instructions on cutting a double mat (the only real set of basic instructions in the book) are unnecessarily complex and arcane. The author fails to explains terms and, probably because she knows her subject too well, assumes simple but important knowledge of the reader(e.g. which is the front mat - the side closest to the art or the viewer?).If you want a 'how-to' book, I would recommend you pass. If you want to get ideas on interesting framing projects (collages and multimedia), then consider getting this."
5,All-around best C refresher/ introduction.,"I have an eight year-old copy, and when getting back into C programming after a long layoff (don't ever take a promotion to project leader if you can't keep coding), I pulled this one off my shelf (skipping K&R's book, Herb Schildt's book, and three others in my library).It got me right back into the mindset quickly (I started with the pointers chapter, where all the action is), and helped me get the rust knocked off quick. The examples are well-explained, small and easy to test, and the progression of the book is logical and sane. Buy it and you can wait a year before needing another book on C."
5,BEST BOOK ON C !!!!,"By far, the best book on C I have ever read! Very well detailed, excellent examples and great, understandable language the author uses! Great for a C beginner or a great refresher for the advanced C programmer! Excellent book!"
4,Very cute Webkinz,"Very cute Husky webkinz, my son wanted a wolf well this is the closest thing i could find, great price, and nice quality toy!"
5,loved it,"This is the second on granma has ordered for her grandkid, and they haven't been disappointed. Very cute, and easy to ship."
5,One of My Favorites,"My Husky ""Sonic"" is a very cute and soft pet. He is very adorable and cuddly. I must say though, you can wear his hair down and he won't be so silky if you play with him too rough, so be careful with it!"
5,VERY SOFT HUSKY!!,"My daughter wanted this item for Christmas ever since she first saw the husky while she was online. She absolutely loves it and Santa couldn't have done better!! She plays with it everyday and loves all the Webkinz that she has. Great to be able to get them at a better price, too!!"
4,the London version of the Lincoln Center revival,"This 1989 London cast album of ANYTHING GOES is the same production as the 1987 Lincoln Center revival (cast album on the RCA label). It features Elaine Paige as the feisty Reno Sweeney.Howard McGillin reprises his 1987 performance of Billy Crocker. McGillin sounds almost identical on both recordings and is fabulous on both albums.Elaine Paige (CATS, SUNSET BOULEVARD) gives a superb performance as the singing chaunteuse-turned evangelist Reno Sweeney, belting out the Cole Porter standards ""Blow, Gabriel, Blow"", ""Anything Goes"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You"".A fabulous recording of the melodious, infectious score. Such a shame that it is currently out-of-print."
2,California Chances,"These are three novellas in one. Although, they are not very long and written by three different women, they seemed long! I didn't even finish the third one. Maybe it was good, but I was worn out! The second was better than the first, but I don't recommend the book. The story and the characters, especially in the first one, just weren't all that interesting."
1,One Word - STUPID!,"OR 2 WORDS ANNOYING. THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES LOVE SAPPY CHRISTMAS MOVIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH DOGS. BUT THIS ONE IS AWFUL. EVERY CHARACTER IS SO ANNOYING, ESPECIALLY THE NARRATOR. THESE FILMS SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF MORAL LESSON TO THEM, BUT NOTHING IS LEARNED FROM THESE SELFISH PEOPLE EXCEPT GIVE ME WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT. I HATED THIS MOVIE WIT A PASSION. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SKIP IT, WATCH HE 12 DOGS OF CHRISTMAS INSTEAD."
3,not as good as i thought it'd be,"i bought philophobia first and i think this album, though it's their debut, is not as good. it's too varied, it's not as consistent as philophobia. of course, you might like it that way. i don't, and i wish someone'd told me that this is the case. of course there are gems on this album, and it's worth buying if you like them, but i'd buy it used. philophobia is much more involving, and the music is better. the middle of this album starts getting strange, sounds as if some kids were just messing around with a tape recorder. which is fine, but just not what i was expecting. and i don't think 'the first big weekend' is such a great song - i don't like the techno type stuff very much at all. oh well. this album lacks the depth of philophobia, the honesty and shamelessness that makes that album so great and that makes me love arab strap so much. about half of this album is good in that way. the rest is filler. eh."
2,Too Basic,"I actually stopped reading this book after about 30 pages. Something seems too obvious while reading it. After getting to about page 30 I just skipped a little and sampled the book randomly: OK,... yes, right..., of course,... End of book.After 6 months or so I've seen the overly positive reviews here in Amazon and tried again... but sorry! this book can be nice for a student trying to grasp what a software process is, but it gives little practical advice for the experienced software fellow.If you want to learn about projects - start withManage It!: Your Guide to Modern, Pragmatic Project Management, a wonderful real life book from the very same series."
4,Well done,"Ship it is a collection of good practices and tools for agile projects. It also presents a methodology called Tracer Bullet Development and introduces several tools that support the practices the book promotes. The book is very well written and put together - it's also a quick, concise read. However, if you've been reading books by Highsmith, Cockburn, and Beck (not to mention Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt) then this will mostly be a rehearsal of familiar material. If not - or if you're struggling to turn the ideas from those books into a process backed up with tools, Ship it is a great place to start."
5,Sexy and sizzling,"Whoa!!! This is one heck of a read! If you like steamy, this is it! Great setting, characters, suspense, a winner! More like this, please!"
2,java programming TOOLS in linux(redhat),"I don't know if the other reviewers have read the books carefully or not because the books have been over-rated. First of all, the book is filled with reference stuff for both linux and java which do not help people to understand either of them. The useful stuffs are to help people WHERE to get java softwares, HOW to install them and how to CONFIGURE them both as SYSTEM wide and USER limited usage and HOW to RUN THE SOFTWARES. In these aspects, the book did not do a very good job. The one website the book referred to is BLACKDOWN which is a good site but the java softwares there are not updated often( it still carries jdk1.2 beta ! ).In conclusion, the book should be trimmed down in half and emphasizes more in those aforementioned stuffs and cut the price. To be fair, the book does contain some good stuffs but these are rare."
2,Not worth it - try Barron's,"I used both this Princeton Review book and the Barron's ""How to Prepare for the GRE"" book. This book was much less helpful - having less example problems and less helpful hints/tips. The vocab section was small and didn't have any way to test yourself.Additionally, the practice CD (and 'online tests') are incredibly repetitive (of the example problems and themselves) and thus are much less helpful. I would NOT recommend this book - there are better ones out there."
3,Medium Flow Nipples for a High Octane Baby,"My wife and I had our first child in January of this year and have embarked on the journey of parenthood, as well as the new found journey of ""concerned about everything, what it's made of, how it works, what shape and size it is, what color is it, how does it smell, who made it, what's the country of origin"" and all of the other quirks that come with being a new parent.We got these playtex dropins as a hopeful alternative to ""le nip d'au naturale"" so that my wife and I could venture out and enjoy some time as a couple again.We ended up with an up and down response for our child, she enjoys chewing on them more than she enjoys sucking out of them, and after a bout a month completely lost interest in the bottle at all.All in all they are a great product, well made, and seem to be easier to latch onto than some other nipple styles, but they just weren't for our little one."
2,Misrepresentation of Features,"The leather carrying case for the Ericsson A1228 and R280 phones, are somewhat misrepresented where features are concerned. After ordering and receiving one of the carrying cases for my R280 phone, based on the advertised features,I was very disapointed when I did not find the tempered belt clips, and the convenient wrist strap, as advertised,which are the very features that sold me on product. I have complete trust however, that the other features are as advertised."
2,a trend that teaches no new things,"Overall, I think the book says things everybody (especially marketer) already knew.For instance, the final recommended nine strategies:- restructure organizations with a consumer-driven orientation.- select and focus on the highest-priority consumer segments.- develop standardized customizaton approaches.- leverage global trends and market intelligence.- increase the priority on innovation.- increase the priority on value.- choose more narrowly targeted and two-way communication vehicles.- align communications strategies with the spirit of tomorrow's consumers- adopt new marketing research approaches to understand tomorrow's consumer.All these ""recommended strategies"" are very ""unsurprised"" to me. Both the recommendation basis and recommendation strategies are just average.I gave two stars because the book was released in 1998, so it might have a little value then (though I doubt it too).Only recommend to college student for marketing basic reading."
5,I am definitely a Clarks fan!,"I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too!I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while.These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet."
1,Polaroid 500 films,"They are bad and old, the pictures never turned out! I don't recommend it so don't buy it I know I wouldn't again!"
2,Looks better then it performs.,"I love the look and feel of this tape, but after it got wet, it lost it's grip on the bar and started to unravel."
3,It was okay,"1. Since U Been Gone: 5/52. I Don't Want To Be: 5/53. Let Me Love You: 3/54. 1, 2 Step: 4/55. Karma: 5/56. So Much More: 1/57. Some Cut: 5/5 (sidenote: the only good song trilville has)8. Bring EM Out: 4/59. Breathe: 5/510. Truth Is: 4/511. Sunday Morning: 4/512. True: 2/513. Nobody's Home: 5/514. Shut Up: 1/515. Let's Go: 1/516. I'm A Hustla: 1/517. Tempted To Touch: 1/518. When It Comes: 3/519. Charlene: 4/520. Turn Da Lights Off: 5/5It was okay a few bumpy roads but overall it's was pretty good. Buy it on sale."
1,Eww,"Not much outside of Ryan Cabrera, Tweet, and Kelly Clarkson. Get Now 18 and 19, they are better. Just download the good tracks and leave this TH stinker at the store."
3,Pixelated Fun for Kids,"This video comes with two episodes of Dora for the Game Boy Advance. I got this for my 2 year old daughter. Video quality is fairly low, but she doesn't seem to mind quite as much as I do! In fact buying this game and a used Game Boy was cheaper than a DVD player for the car, so I'm satisfied."
1,waste of money,If you can't deal with B movies don't try to watch this. They tried to put together a cute story but the acting was painfully bad.
1,turned it off,"either I wasn't in the right mood, but couldn't even make it through the first half hour. Don't waste your two bucks"
4,Amusing romp,This movie was very cute. I liked the first person narrative from the Lou character. The main couple were very cute together and absolutely believable as a couple. The premise was certainly real enough. Some of the dream-like sequences were a little odd but no moreso than the first season of the L Word with the opening scenes there. It ended the way it should and had a nice little lesson attached... maybe more than one. We would recommend this for a nice evening in.
2,Power supply is fine - antenna is of limited to no value,The adapter works fine for power supply. I did not find that the antenna increases distance of reception any at all. If it does increase reception it is such a small amount that it is not detectable traveling in problem areas. Would not recommend if increased reception is the primary goal for the product.
1,Very Poor quality,"The picture quality of this DVD is absolutely dire. The picture and sound track are awful and are in need of restoration. The sound track by Tex Ritter ""The Marshall's Daughter"" is different from the Record release."
5,Our entire family has read this great book at least twice!,"This wonderful book covers every aspect of parentcare. However,it's not so much about caring for old people, it's more aboutwhat we babyboomers are going through as we watch our parentsget old and die. One member of our family read the book thenpassed it along to another, and so on, until all 8 of us readit, and now it's getting passed around again! Maybe we shouldbuy another copy!"
1,Step Away from the Shopping Cart!,"What an incredible disappointment and an amazing learning experience. I should have looked much closer at the details and description. The one page you will receive contains nothing you don't already know. Don't waste your time - trust me, it's old news."
3,Worth what you pay for.,"Kudos to the makers for shipping quickly. The product was exactly what they promised.As a game, it was worth only the $6 I paid for it. After looking through the material, we decided to buy a ""How to Host a Murder"" brand game for $30 and had a good time."
2,I never did find the Stolen Jew...,"I was intrigued by the title of this book and the brief dustjacket blurbs, so I took it out of the library. I forced myself through about 100 pages, but finally gave up on it, which is something I rarely do. The author has a penchant for run-on sentences with nested commas, semicolons and parentheses which I don't have the patience to decode. Call me insensitive, but I found the characters far too angst ridden for me to want to spend my time with.Mind you, I'm an avid reader and have breezed through other supposedly impenetrable books that others had pronounced as unreadable. This novel just failed to grab me and make me want to stick with it.I am interested in novels dealing with Jewish identity, as my own has undergone many changes. I find the works of Steven Stern more to my taste along these lines."
2,Don't buy this,Doesn't work. I bought this for data. Doesn't work from day one. I bought this for dish network. Could not use it
3,"Misleading! Not for phone use, data works ok.","Although the description says it can be used to ""add a telephone to a room"" and the technical details don't say anything about it being limited to data, the model I received and the extension jack are both for data only. That means you can't add a telephone. The Phonex box has a photo of the extension hooked up to a telephone and clealy states that it can be used for that purpose, but when you open the box, the base and extension units are both marked ""data only"" and the reception is all static if you try to plug in a phone. That said, as long as you only need it for data, it works ok. I have it hooked up to the phone line for my DirecTV receiver and another extension unit hooked up to my modem, and they seem to be working fine."
2,Great while it worked,"Worked just fine....... as advertised, but only for about 3 months and then it simply stopped functioning. The lights lit up indicating it was properly connected, etc. but it wouldn't transmit anymore or something."
2,Will not buy again.,"When they were operable sometimes they worked sometimes they didn't. After a year they don't work at all. I think these are a waste, have a jack installed or run a line underneath the floorboard. Find another way, don't waste your money."
1,Easy Jack,A good product but didn't serve the purpose I bought it for. I was disappointed because I was getting an annoying static hissing sound in the background when I used the telephone. I had to return it for refund.
1,Did not work.,The Phonex system did not work. Apparently a bad transmitter. Returned. Will look for an alternative.
4,Can't really say - item returned.,"I can't honestly review this item, as I returned it without using it after learning that it wasn't what I should be buying."
3,Graded French Reader Première Etape,"I bought this to use with my French 3/4 class. While I am pleased with the stories, I am not pleased that there is not an available teacher's guide. While I am quite capable of answering all of the comprehension questions as well as the grammar questions, this is very time consuming."
2,Dangerous hold-down clamp,"The saw is great but I ended up in the ER with 4 stitches to my finger, and a $1500 hospital bill, after getting it lacerated by the hold-down clamp. The exposed 90-degree edges on the hold-down clamp can give you a nasty laceration in normal use. I had gotten my hand pinched by this thing and I should have been suspicious. I was using the clamp on the left side position (I'm right-handed) and when it engages, the pressure you are applying suddenly reduces as the clamp engages, this caused my hand to slip off the handle and into the path of the mechanism of the clamp. All Bosch would have to do is round the edges of the metal bar assembly or put some kind of guard around it. I'm super careful around all my power tools and especially saws, but it didn't occur to me that the hold-down clamp would be the source of a serious injury. I could still work but my finger was sore for two weeks, and a hospital bill that cost more than two saws."
2,junky,"used it 6 months and its now collecting dust in my garage. Unless you keep your blade on this saw ultra sharp it will run out. I've gone back to 10""inch saws namely the Makita, best saw for your money hands down by me. I have 2 10"" makitas and absolutely love them. I've been cutting wood for 30 years and have used near to all the saws out there......the makita is the best I've found and the hitachi's come in second. And I'm not Japanese...lol. Btw in addition you'll get 5 times more life out of the makita 10'blade too.......why is that?"
1,No receipt due to supposed Amazon agreement dispute,"Zero stars is more appropriate: I did not receive the Bosch 5412L 12"" Sliding Compound Miter saw because the seller claimed that Amazon agreed to a standard delivery cost but after the sale changed shipping cost from $43 to $150+"
3,"Saw is good, OEM blade is terrible","Received the saw in good shape....assembly was easy; setup accuracy was not a problem. But there was one major disappointment...with a hefty price tag as this machine carries, I expected a beautifully smooth cut from the blade....the blade is terrible, it was not sharp, it splinters hardwood and softwood. To make a decent cut, you have to very slowly enter the blade into the wood....if you do this, you might get a satisfactory cut. This blade is not good enough to cut 2 x 4's on a building site. I plan to use this in finish carpentry and trim work.Other than the blade disappointment, the machine is very good. More stars would be available if the machine was complete with a quality blade.A Forrest blade is on order to replace this poor quality blade."
4,bring african music to your home,the sound of the late fela that speaks of the trouble and hard times people have to suffer in the hands of the political oppressors in africa....then when he wants to talk about love..this is the dvd for you... slund is great...picture the best you can get ..kgraeat choice of african music
5,Excellent story!,"He Knew He Was Right is a very enjoyable dvd to watch. Albeit the story was melancholy because he was so very paranoid, and the gentleman causing the paranoia knew he was stirring the pot! Bittersweet but with a definite moral point to lovers everywhere.I love period pieces, the costumes, and the locations in which they are set. This is worth watching!"
4,Well done Victorian piece,"I really enjoyed this series although I have to say, the insanity that befell the husband of the heroine is perplexing. The casting was superb and the Mr. Gibson character did a great comedic performance with the French sisters. I am just sorry that the main characters had a sad ending compared to the rest of the bunch. Everyone else found true love except for Mr. Gibson but he seemed incapable of it in any event. I just wish the whole story had a happy ending. But that aside it was very enjoyable to watch and I may even read the book."
4,A Good Film,This movie has a good plot---The one or two sex scenes are very tame.I'd rate them with a G rating.The lead gentleman thught he was rightabout his wife's infidelity and lost everything.Good English acting. Shows English women as we have read them to be.19th Century Britlit Classic
1,I Knew He was Crazy,"Man, I wish I had read all the reviews for this movie before I bought it. Stunk big time. I always have such high hopes for the English Classics, so the dissapointment falls harder when they are lacking. This one lacks."
3,Pretty good showing,Reads like a typical first book of what is a great story line but needs more depth in characters. Great concept but this book seems to count on characters not being able to think through situations very well. Pretty predictable story line until the end. I had to say I did not see that one coming. Interesting how you can watch the author develop in their writing style through the book. Slow starting but I will buy then next book if only to watch the author develop.
4,Conversations between a psychologist and mothers of children,"This little book consists of conversations between a psychologist and mothers of children (yes, there are a few fathers, too). The goal is to help parents live more easily with their children, by educating them to choose the best response in daily interactions.Bettelheim uses a sort of Socratic method to get parents to ask the ""right"" questions. This book makes interesting although sometimes dated reading from a childcare expert who was radical in 1962, due to his openness in discussing various topics, such as masturbation, spanking, etc. He comes off as rather benevolently patronizing to the various women with whom he speaks.Worth adding to the parenting bookshelf!"
2,Very bland reading,"This book is one of the worst let-downs I've read in a long, long time. The plot is tired. The characters are not in the least endearing...halfway through the book, you're still wondering why you should care about them. Worst of all, the prose is extremely cliche.If you're looking for something to read at bedtime, this yawner will put you to sleep. If you're looking for something to while away the hours, you could do worse, but not much."
2,Disappointment,"When I bought this book I wanted to apply design pattern to C#. But James Cooper failed to deliver it. This book is a clone from Java Design Pattern. The author didn't even try to use a feature of C# such as property, foreach loop, etc. eventhough he's aware about it. All coding style is Javaish, but the title of the book is ""C# Design Patterns."" I understand the goal is to learn Design Patterns but at least the author must adapt the C# coding style and use more feature of C# to be consistent with the title and purpose of the book. As far as Design Pattern goes, I learned from it, but I wish the implementation would be better."
2,Not For Beginners,"I am a seasoned knitter. I saw this DVD advertised in a lot of the knitting catalogs and rave reviews on Amazon. Finally I gave in and purchased a copy.If you think you'd enjoy knitting with Mrs. Doubtfire, then you will probably enjoy knitting with Elizabeth Zimmermann. She is entertaining and has a wonderful sense of humor.That being said, I gave the DVD only two stars because this is not a workshop for beginners. It is a great review of techniques for someone who already knows how to knit. It is sometimes hard to follow due to Elizabeth's self-editing of her directions and rapid speech.I am sad to say that, for me, I was disappointed in the production. I think it was initially a PBS series which would explain the adlibs and self-editing.If your local library has a copy, I recommend viewing it prior to making a purchase. This is an expensive DVD to just sit on the shelf."
4,My Granddaughter loved it,My Granddaughter loved this Blimp. She picked it out and could hardly wait for it to arrive. It was the hit of her Birthday party.
2,Short but not sweet,"I was anxious to read this book because I heard that it was going to be made into a movie, but became horribly bored after the book went no where. Completely aghast when Mr. M peed on the tramp and I felt that the story went downhill from there. I usually pass my books on after reading good stories, but this one......not. Maybe they will improve on the film."
2,"Pretty, but doesn't fit well","Over all, it is very pretty, and the fabric does seem very durable, but it does not fit well at all. It sort of bubbles up around the buckles. I had to have help jury-rigging it to stay on the seat at all. My son has difficulty buckling himself in because the buckles keep sliding in under the fabric.I don't allow my kids to eat or drink in the car, so I won't have to worry about that kind of mess getting past the seat cover. At least this cover should protect against some normal wear and tear. And if you don't look at it from inside the car, you can't tell that it doesn't fit. :P"
5,An Amazing Book,This book caught my eye at the library and has changed my outlook on life. After reading it I ordered a copy just to have it on hand. I have told many friends about this book and they all want to read it based on the effect it has had on me. This is a must read whether you are a Christian or not. It is definitely worth the price. The only thing that I struggled with was that the beginning chronicles a horrible life. It is difficult to read about for some.
2,slow light,"bought these thinking it would make things easier. Some what disappointed, each time I'd have to use 3 or 4 cubes to get an even burn in the coal. After one box, I whiched to the electric wand what a differnce. In eight minutes, grills lit and ready to cook."
1,Worst book I have ever Read !,"How can you like a book when the first twenty pages a girl is raped. Then has her clothes ripped off and tide to a pole and flogged. That is sick. The torture this poor girl went through, I cant believe anyone whould think this a good book. I love Connie Mason, I have read almost every book she has written, and this is the worst! Sorry Connie but I aint into abuse. I know you have to come up with new material but Rape shouldnt be one of them. I am sure things like this happened back then, but I like to read romance, to have hope and to know that the underdog comes out on top and Cinderella really does get her Prince."
1,it is not romance,It is rubbish from the beginning to the end. Connie Mason should reimburse the readers for the spirit torture!
4,Good overall review,"Those who are familiar with the Squadron series should be happy with the degree of information included in this book. This book, as are most of the Squadron publications, were a great overall review for the budget minded aviation buff and plastic modeler. Lots of great pictures and accurate info about a much maligned but important aircraft. A good deal of valuable photographs for plastic modelers are included. This was a typical Squadron publication that supplied enough information to make the reader feel that they had learned something valuable about this airplane. If you are a hard core modeler, or are looking for info about unit actions then this might not be exactly what you are looking for. Regardless, for the price this book was well worth the expenditure. I have been collecting these Squadron books for years and have come back to them again and again, as have my sons, for important information. This one is well worth putting in your collection."
3,Not Curremt,"Just recieved the book today and discovered that it covers the 2.0 version of SureTrak which makes the software related examples out of date.The title as listed is Construction Scheduling with SureTrak and the book itself is titled Scheduling with SureTrak. Also, amazon.com lists the book as hardcover and the delivered book is not.Looks like it is a fine book. I like the exercises provided.It just needs to be updated to the current version of the software."
4,A great holiday tradition,"This movie is so great. It has been a holiday tradition to see the nutcracker every year on pnb or new york, but those are expensive. Amazing but expensive! So we are definitely able to watch it only once!! But thanks to this movie we can watch our favorite scenes again! They definitely played with the special effects, but other wise it's fun. And a safer bet than taking a Very Young one to the actual ballet. Wait till they are at least two! Trust me :)"
1,Crappy,"This guitar is small, the buttons are very hard to press compared to the standard guitar, and it is NOT A WIRELESS GUITAR. The guitar does NOT come with a receiver to plug into the Playstation, it just has a battery pack in the back. Also, this guitar's cord is at least a foot shorter than the regular guitar so unless you want to be REALLY mean to one of your friends...get something else."
5,awesome tool,"Excellent tool, i was worried that the 6 inch might be too long to fit in my pocket but I now wish I'd gotten it. Might have to buy another knife... :)"
4,1992 A&P Airframe Textbook,This 1992 copy is a well presented version of the Airframe textbook. It has some information not included in the current 2003 version which is why I purchased it.
1,Not the best example of the Sounds of Nature series.,"This CD has an eerie quality. I found it to be spooky, rather than relaxing."
4,Like meditating.,"Windchimes have become sophisticated and popular in recent years. This CD is not a catalogue of the wide variety of sounds of the up-scale windchimes now available. Instead, it gives the feeling of taking a long walk through a neighborhood and hearing the constant rush of wind and repetitive sound of pretty much the same chimes. They're not the very high-pitched, tinkly kinds of chimes, and they're a little bit minor in tone. Birds sing and caw in the background at times. It's because of this CD's very repetitiveness and lack of sophistication that I like it a lot. I find it to be like meditating."
2,DANG BIRDS!,"almost perfect except the dang birds. every cd you rent or come across seems to have hideous, loud mouthed birds. took it back to the library. Autumn Breeze."
1,A little Duct Tape,"The release of the velcro as it swiveled past the belt clip just cost me a new phone.Nokia Customer service denied even the slightest hint that their design might be slightly flawed.Duct tape around just the case at the velcro fastener, provides a lovely silver accent, and keeps the velcro from being released as the case swivels past the belt clip.The tape can be removed to replace the battery when that becomes necessary. It does rather defeat the use of the desktop charger, or any other accesory which connects to a ""standing"" phone."
2,Clip Case Problems,"The swivel case is a nice idea, but if you happen to sit down and the phone doesn't swivel in the anticipated direction, the plastic belt clip will break and disconnect from the connector on the back of the leather case. This will allow the phone to fall, or worse, land quietly where someone else will find it. If you shop around you can find an aftermarket leather case that will fit this phone like a glove, which has a stiched on clip on the back, like a better eyeglass case. The case also has a clear plastic vinyl sheet which covers the keys and doesn't interfere with dialing at all. (and a detatchable wrist strap) I have been happier with the aftermarket leather case."
2,"Good looking, but...","I must admit that this case, is by far the best looking case on the market. This is as far as compliments will go however. This case was designed for looks only - no consideration was made for performance,comfort, or security. For example, the flap which closes the case is closed by a tiny velcro strip which too easily ""catches"" on anything it comes in contact with.This opens the case enough so that by merely kneeling down the phone falls out. Also, this phone unlike previous Nokias is NOT made using the same quality of plastics - this makes the clear lens far to susceptible to scratching. This case ideally would have covered the clear lens thus,alleviating the scratching problem. This leather case is also not very comfortable - when sitting the swivel ""bites"" into your sides. All in all I guess - ""Good luck"" is in order if you decide to buy this case."
5,My Favourite Movie,"I can always relate with either Isak, Folke or Grant. This type of humour is an acquired taste, but I love it. I highly recommend renting this to see if you like it before buying it, but I don't think you will be disappointed either way."
3,Great- if you know a programming language.,"I'm just beginning to learn about programming. This book looks like a very powerful resource if you already know a programming language, but I definitely need a ""For Dummies"" version."
1,lasted one month before breaking,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I GAVE IT AS A GIFT, WHAT A SHAME TO WATCH IT TURN TO JUNK SO QUICKLY."
4,Good inexpensive earbuds,"Nothing mystical or magical here; basic earbuds for my iPod. But they are a good value for the money. I previously had a rather expensive pair of Sennheisers, and while they were great, they were really overkill. Besides, I felt a constant bit of nervousness with them while wearing them hiking or throwing them in a backpack, etc. Expensive earbuds are--surprise!--expensive (and my concerns were justified: I ended up losing the Sennheisers about a month ago). So the risk of damaging or losing them was constantly on my mind. These little guys sound a little less wonderful (but hey we're talking about MP3 files here so the quality is only going to get so high anyway), and I am no longer freaked out about anything happening to them. They are right now at the bottom of a bunch of stuff in my backpack and I feel fine about it. They are comfortable and sound just fine."
3,"Great Headphones, but the cover can't stay on!","I bought these at a different store, in White.Sound is great for headphones under $20.I can wear these for hours.BUT,The plastic cover fell off with in 2 weeks. Then 2 days later the mesh covering the speaker fell off.The headphones cannot be replaced.But they are cheap enough to buy a replacement.Since the headphones can be detached from the microphone, I can also now use any headphone with my iPhone."
3,they are ok. misleading though... not for small ear,"This product has great sound. But the reason i bought it is because i thought it had adjustable ear loops... which it doesnt. they are just flexible, not adjustable. The insert that goes in the ear does hurt after a while... it might be because i have small ears. In any case an ok product but not what i was looking for or expecting."
3,Decent but needs some work,"These were really comfortable and worked really well. Im not the type that us picky about sound. The problems for me came with function, the plastic peices inserted into the ear are great but fall off all the time, I superglued mine on and recommend everyone who owns these does the same. The biggest problem is that after about a month the cord broke and I lost sound in one ear."
2,Ear Clips fall apart,"I really liked mu iLuv ear clips when I got them but, after only a few weeks they are falling apart! First the ear cushions fell off and now part of the mechanism itself has disappeared. This is just from carrying them around. They do not hold up very well!"
3,"Ok, Not great","These earphones are good for what they are priced. I had the same problem of the rubber buds falling off and then the metal screens falling out. Though the sound quality wasn't affected, the quality of the way they are built doesn't impress me. Also they fit uncomfortably in my ear. I haven't had problems with other ear buds, maybe they just make these smaller than other ear buds."
5,These are great!,"This is probably one of the few pairs of earphones I've had that actually stay in your ear. I've gone through MANY earphones that are clips, and they were always loose, or the fabric over the speakers would rip. This is definitely not a problem with these. The speaker is somewhat similar to an earbud, but the fact that these loop over your ear keep them in place. The blue on the earphones look somewhat like a gel in the picture, but it's actually not. The blue on mine is a little darker than pictured. These also have a volume control on the wire, which I didn't see mentioned. But for small headphones, they have a wonderful sound. And if you don't like blue, they make it in several other colors. They go great with my iPod Touch and blue case! :)"
1,Not the item in the photo,"The earphones SUCK. They are NOT the iLuv headphones in the picture. The rubber piece that fits behind your ear is much thinner and too long for my ear. I have to wear sunglasses when I run and keep the headphones ""pinned"" to my ears or they'll fall off. I LOVED the headphones in the photo and can't find them in any stores. I was exited to order them and incredibly disappointed with what arrived. I would DEFINITELY not recommend to potential buyers."
2,behind the ear hooks,"the behind the ear hook is a clear plastic that is really soft and has no real hold and the in the ear part looks odd and bulky not the best idea the volume control is nice, and there is good sound"
5,iLuv white headphones,"I love iLuv headphones. They are perfect for me because the regular kind don't fit in my ears. And, the other kinds like them are hard and hurt my ears. iLuv are soft."
3,Really loose fit,"The design is good. However, they seem to fit very loosely in my ear. More so while running. The earbuds don't go inside the ear. I rarely use these earphone these days. The sound quality is good though."
5,Catherine Tate is hilarious!,This show is absolutely hilarious if you enjoy British humor. :) I bought it because I loved Catherine in Doctor Who and I'm glad I did!
4,Great laugh,"If you enjoy ""Little Britain"" and "" French and Saunders"", you will appreciate this comedy show. Catherine Tate is very versatile in her characters, and you will really appreciate her sense of humor."
5,"The Woman of Many, Many Different Faces!!!","Catherine Tate may be one of the newest talents to arrive from England. Her show is not yet broadcasted in America as it should have. Regardless, it is one of the funniest shows that I have seen in a long time and Catherine Tate is becoming one of my television favorites. She can transform herself from a young flygirl teenager to an annoying old woman. In between, she plays the woman who is frightened of her own shadow; the mall information lady who is useless, haven't we met one of them; the woman who can't get drunk enough to have sex with her boyfriend; the drunk real estate agent who makes crude remarks, and others. Anyway, the six episodes are really wonderful to watch over and over again. As somebody who got the first season of the show, I hope other American anglophiles will take a chance on Catherine Tate. She's one of Britain's funniest leading ladies."
2,Arrived Flat,The ball was in good packaging but arrived totally flat. Now I have to go figure out how to inflate it!
5,My 2 year old son loves kicking Spongebob,"This ball was a big hit with my 2 year old. He asks for his Spongebob ball all the time. Its the perfect size and he is a big fan of football and has a very good kick. And with so many kids in the neighbourhood with their own footballs, its easy for him to identify his ball. We've had it for over 6 months and so far its kept up well and he uses it daily. I have not had to pump it yet so it holds air very well"
2,Skip this one,"This book was not very good at all. I was especially turned off when the author included a shameless plug about herself at a book signing.The stories were boring and I found myself not caring about what happens to the characters at all. I was actually skipping pages just to finally get it over with.If you want an exciting read, you'll be disappointed with this one."
1,Too expensive for what it is,"This product is not worth more than US 20.00 but regretable you pay US 100.00, for a very small improvement for objects being recorded at closer than 3ft. It is nothing more than a simple plastic LED lamp. I can only suggest to spend your money where you receive something better."
1,"OFTA. A Dissection Guide, NOT An Anatomy Textbook","This book is a dissection guide, not an anatomy textbook. I personally found it unhelpful- it is specifically structured for use in the Oxford medical school dissection classes (so fairly useless for medical students at other medical schools), and is unnecessary if you have a half-decent anatomy demonstrator/ prosector. On the other hand, it contains only very basic details, which would be unlikely to be sufficient to guide you through even the most basic anatomy exam. Use it as a sole textbook to learn anatomy at your peril."
3,OK With + and -,"This book is ok with plusses and minuses. On the good side, the prestige classes were cool; some new, powerful spells were introduced; and the philosophy of each alignment was presented. The alignment philosophies were the most usefull part of the book for me. I finally know how a lawful good/neurtal/evil cleric differs from a chaotic good/neutral/evil cleric. However, there was little roleplaying information. How do some of these new spells and prestige classes fit into my campaign? (I guess that it's completely up to me). I would like to have seen more castles and temples, more campaign information, and more about how to blend religious orders into the leadership hierarchy of a kingdom. Anyway, I did get some ""food for thought"" from this supplement, and the games must go on."
1,"It was bad, it was really bad","I've been a long time fan of Dungeons and Dragons, i've got shelves of books and have played in a ridiculous number of campaigns. I thought third edition was ok and have been picking up the new class books as they come out. Sword and Fist was fairly good, lots of neat feats and prestige classes. Defenders is bad. It's really bad.The new feats are far from spectacular, there's only one or two that a player would ever consider using - regardless of character concept. The specialty classes are unimaginative. The new spheres are eh. Most importantly of all, the ideas presented within are easily reached by anyone vaguely creative or who has any gaming experience.I strongly urge you to borrow a copy of the book before purchasing it. WotC doesn't care about providing you with a quality product, they're merely skirting the edge of decency to get everyone to buy it. It's not the good ole' days of TSR where they actually cared about putting out an interesting, usuable product."
2,medocre at best,"The book really is not all that interesting. Yes there are more magic items, spells, prestige classes, and mounts. However none of these really stand out. Also, there is little in the way of new ideas given for either Clerics and Paladens. I give the book 2 stars, generally to counter-balance the other mediocre reviews of 3 stars, since the book clearly deserves a 2.5 rating."
3,not bad,"it wasn't what I expected, was a little harder for 9 month old baby to put in month, as far as less mess, I think it's the same with any other spoon; it just depends on your child's coordination."
2,These didn't work for us.,"Being completely plastic, made it more difficult for my daughter to learn to eat on her own, than a spoon with a stainless steel handle. These were just too light weight. The shape was also difficult to maneuver for myself and my child. We tried them maybe a couple of times, and then they stayed in the drawer."
1,Unimpressed,Poorly written and amateurishly directed. It wasn't as good as a thrown-together t.v. movie. Appears actors capable of better performance if given the chance.
4,Knitting: The Baby Surprise Jacket,"I'm an advanced beginner knitter, and I tried and tried to figure out how to knit this adorable jacket. The video made it so easy and fun. Can't wait to make another one."
4,Great introduction,"This is a wonderful introduction to the legend of Arthur. The story is told in a nice, straightforward way that doesn't interfere with the wonderful drawings. There's enough detail in the drawings to entertain an older artist, but not so much that a younger person will get frustrated trying to color."
5,Webkinz,"I have four webkinz and love them. They unlock an online world where you can play fungames, care for your pet, chat with other owners, and much more.This is a great gift for children13 and under. It also has an educational side to it. You can play math games, or go dotrivia about science. The stuffed animals are adorable and durable. I have had mine forabout two or three years and none of them has even ripped. They are still in mintcondition.i don't have the raccoon in particular, but they are all pretty much the same.I highly reccomend these!"
4,learned something new,The little bear in the story has just awokefrom his hibernation. He goes out of the woods in search of some food. He finds himself at a home where there is a Purim celebration going on. The people see the bear and think that he must be just a child dressed up for the parade. They invite him in the house for a feast. After eating so much food the bear is ready for a nap. The family tries to wake him so he can take part in the play. He gives a loud growl and they find out he is a real bear!What did you like or not like about the book?I had never heard of Purim before. The note in the back explained the holiday well.
4,"Haines, Moran and Dressler in one movie","Great to have another movie on DVD with William Haines. I like this actor very much. He's somehow funny, charming... handsome of course.The movie itself isn't bad. It has any funny moments and I enjoyed it very much. I liked very much the scenes between him and Polly Moran (as housemaid) and Marie Dressler. Both are great comedians.The DVDthe picture quality isn't perfect of course. But for not restored or remastered still very good and also the sound is acceptable.the only minus point (star) I have: no english subtitles."
