5,Great recording,"If you like Bolcom's piano works, this CD is for you. Really an astonishing performance!!"
2,Cursive template,I was excited when I got this in the mail- for practicing cursive for my son- but the letters are to big! Not realistic size- I wish the letters were a little smaller/ so that kids can practice cursive on lined paper-not only is it expensive- which I didn'tMind if it would work well- but not very practical for use with lined paper.
1,"atonal, amusical combinations of sounds by a mathematician..",...who lacks the slightest fragment of a musical bone in his body. this cd contains music for the eye and head by all-star theorist milton babbitt. recommended listening for the intellectual and mathematically talented deaf person with score in hand.
3,American breakthrough,"Because Whitesnake only broke big in America during their hair metal period, people remember them as a hair band, but that isn't strictly true. In the UK and Europe, Whitesnake had been a highly successful, classy blues/ rock band with a big reputation and a supreme live album (""In the Heart of the City"") to their name. This blues heritage gives their 1987 album a genuine rock & roll authenticity that takes it a cut above many cheesy rock bands. That said, this CD isn't lacking in cheese itself.Guitarist John Sykes (ex-Thin Lizzy) provides gutsy axe work that puts hair on the chest of Coverdale's bluesy songs and manly vocals. In short, they introduce Def Leppard to Led Zeppelin and with huge hits like ""Here I Go Again"", everything comes up roses."
4,One of my All-time Favorites!!!!!,"This album was my first ""car"" cassette. I taught myself to drive to this album and, unfortunately, crash to it also!!! ""Crying in the rain"" was a big fav for my friends and I and ""Is this love"" from the video play on MTV. I still have that cassette (It survived the crash better than my car!!!) This one rocks the house!!!!!"
1,This Is Not Whitesnake!,"This album is the most blatant example of ""selling out"" that could ever be presented for your consideration.I can understand wanting to make money, but I wish that David Coverdale had been more like Ayn Rand's character Howard Roarke! The recognition that his original style deserved would have come in time - I'm certain of that, considering the revival of blues and blues rock that occurred in the 90's.Please try not to hold this music against Coverdale and the many talented musicians he worked with prior to it.Check out the Slide It In album and anything earlier (such as Love Hunter, Snakebite, etc.)."
2,Pretty poor,"Well past their peak. Even though most, if not all, of the original WS musos had gone they still had to re-cycle the songs with guitar solos high on the ol'treble control.What is worse there is no Moody slide, the killer decision is getting any WS album."
2,80s nostalgia that should remain buried,"Whitesnake were always an anomaly amongst rock(?) bands. Most of the original WS were from 70s classic rock and heavy blues bands, and their early albums reflected this, but then the 80s hit and metal became trendy and fashionable, and WS reformed themselves to be the ultimate hair metal band. The band became a farce, with the only constant being David Coverdale, who then still had one of the best rock voices around, and a rotating band of musicians, all of whom were good, but combined made WS possibly the ugliest (and the oldest) hair metal bands around, which did nothing for their popularity.This is an OK album at the start of their downfall. If you really like mediocre 80s hair metal ballads this is for you, if you like blues-rock music pick their earlier albums."
4,Definitely a read that you'll remember,"I agree with the first comment, this is a book that is hard in its content to read. The information here doesn't list it, but this book was first published in 1941. Figure that one out. The copy I have was my grandfathers, published a couple years later. I have not seen depictions of Hitler in film etc. in my generation (X) show any of the insights and depth that Dr. Krueger will walk the reader through. It is certainly intimate and will make one think and question and think some more."
1,sad waste of time,"Freeman's credibility is as bankrupt as his opinions. This is a book riddled with factual errors and a total disregard for research, history or insight. Freeman is a very young critic, and it shows in his writing. Virtually any other book on the subject is more informed than this half-baked diatribe."
2,Blind adulation,"I have one big problem with this book, namely the author's style. Freeman expresses himself ""fan"" style, much like a pre-pubescent teenager gushing about a heartthrob-of-the-week. While I respect Freeman's right to express his opinions about the music being discussed, his style is a great distraction. Freeman's approach can best be described as ""Beavis and Butthead""-style, except that he is adulating free improv recordings instead of heavy metal videos. This is silly....The interview content is interesting and the format and layout of the book are respectable, but Freeman doesn't really add much to the discourse. He writes on the jacket, ""If you don't agree with me, write your own book and I'll read it."" How about this quote from ME, Phil? ""I'll pass on your book and buy some music."""
1,Freeman is the Hilary Duff of Serious Jazz Literature,"Word is, Mr. Freeman is working on a new book on Miles Davis for Backbeat. Let's hope it makes more sense than this one did. New York is Now! Not Freeman's New York, and not Anytime Soon. Free jazz is just a house on fire. The fact that he thinks to connect everything to death metal is just ridiculous. Approach this book like you would that cap worn by Michael Moore. Peeking inside could prove to be psychologically damaging."
4,Husband still reading.,"My husband didn't have a father, and very few male role models and I came from a male dictatorship type of family. So this book has really helped us both. It has helped me identify a lot of my feelings, and it has helped my husband wrap his mind around why I do some of the things I do. Not only that but it is helping both of us communicate and work together as more of a team. So glad we bought it!!"
2,"great idea, but who's got the time?","This is a great concept, however, you have to drag the ball around the bathtub for 10 minutes to get the chlorine out. No thank you. I sent it back and was given an option to exchange or a refund, so I just ordered the shower filter. I figure I'll just fill up the bathtub with the shower and have my son bathe in that water."
1,mine also died too,This product started out of the box. When I changed to the second tank it took an hour of trying to get it to start. For the third tank I could not get it to start at all. Not sure if it decreased the mosquitos or not.
1,doesnt fit the ipod,"i was disappointed to find that it didnt fit the ipod, and it didnt include a plastic protective covering for the screen as advertised."
1,Flat and boring,"Plot is predictable and dialogue flat and unwitty. Most of all, I am quite annoyed that the female protagoinist was so passive and obedient (maybe I am too used to reading romance novels with strong-willed and stubborn female protagonists) and the male protagonist was so whiney and wishy-washy. Don't read this book! Balogh's ""Simply"" and ""Slightly"" series are a lot better."
2,Huh?,"This book has to be an old book Ms. Balogh wrote a long time ago because it isn't on par with her more recent work. I understand that the hero has issues to work through but I found myself not really pulling for him. The young lady is totally lacking, flat , boring and never speaks her mind. Don't waste your money. Mary Balogh is better than this, try another title."
3,When the hero is not a hero...,"The story is interesting. The heroine is quite all right....but the hero. ! ! !if you read the book's resum√©, you know what the story is all about. an interesting story as Mme Balogh knows how to write. She keeps us reading.But what does the heroine do with this hero? it's a M. less the average man, no interest, non even gentle to the heroine. Not a person you'd like to meet, even less dream about. The heroine has no choice in this story but I just can't understand why she's in love with him... appreciate him for what he bring her as an upgrade to her life style but love him? no way!"
3,unbendable,This lock seems quite sturdy and the only reason I did not 5 star it is because it is larger than I wanted in total size but not length the 6 foot length is perfect but it will not fit well in a cargo pocket and is bulky and hard to unfurl. The lock comes with a sturdy bike mount for travel which is nice. I think it will keep a bike safe but if you have to use it ten times a day it might start to wear on the nerves fighting it each use. It is thick and rubber coated and the re-settable combination lock is awesome. Mostly a 5 star product just a bit too big and stiff for me.
3,Another Tome on How to Catch A Man,"This book basically tells you how to catch yourself a man. Although long, it's not very well written and things are repeated over and over. The author does provide basic sound advice, i.e., a woman should get a life, use common sense, and advocates somewhat of a Zen approach: Get a Life and He Will Appear Out of Nowhere. Also helpful hints on getting over a broken heart. If the comic strip character ""Cathy"" ever wrote a book, this would be it!!!"
3,Content: Wonderful.... Format: disappointing,"We wanted a DVD, but instead got a digital copy. We don't have any way to use this, so it was money wasted. That said, the content of the film (which we saw elsewhere) is wonderful. For anyone who loves the Santa Fe Railroad in its heyday, for railfans of 1930's-40's-50's passenger service, for those who want to know how to travel in high style in the mid-20th century, this is fascinating."
3,Very Slow Read...,"I have to say it, I did not like this book... Usually it takes me a week, tops, to read a good Star Trek book. But with this book it took me Three months to strugle through it... The only reason I keept going was because I paid for it and did not want to waist good money (Books are twice as expensive in Denmark than in the US). I the other reviews, and the only one I agree with is the first... Unless you absolutly have to have every single book in the series, I would NOT recommend thins book. For me personally it was a waist of money. Worst ST book I ever read, and I have read A LOT..."
1,Very confusing advert and misleading,"I completely agree with the previous two reviews. If all the synopsis' are kept the same how are we meant to tell what each product contains?! One other thing, the episode at the end of season five was 'grave DANGER', not digger."
2,Thick,"Lots of content covering the Napster rise and ... transition. But, after a strong opening, it wasn't all that entertaining to read in the end. The book had a lot of important details and facts which led to Napster's history being the way that it was, but I was hoping for more anecdotal and fun stories about the company."
1,A terribly slow rehash of previously published material,"Just finished Menn's ""All The Rave,"" a.k.a. the Napster chronicles....for what it's worth, i found very little new material here - most of the scoop is previously published....& to my dismay, nothing is reported on Shawn Fanning's new venture, Snocap. An interesting twist for Shawn with Snocap, several journals are reporting that Fanning's new company seeks to end illegal file-swapping with an avalanche of controls...interesting twist, wouldn't you say for the guy who created fild-sharing to begin with...again nothing of this is reported in Menn's book which feels heavily dated by now.At any rate, the book read kinda slow....though the thing i do appreciate the most is the book's cover art - kitty in black."
2,"Not Deep, Not Interesting, and Not Worth Reading","This book is not remotely relatable, interesting, and despite attempts, touching. I am not made of steel, and cry at everything, however, this book tries to be touching and sad, and I found myself not caring about any of the characters, the book boring, and one of the more difficult books to finish. Do not waste your time."
4,Happy to find on Amazon.com,"To the best of my knowledge they stopped manufacturing Silk Effects blades so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.com.I have no complaints, the service was good and I'm happy with the product."
2,Over Priced Refills,"I love the silk effects razor, it's the price of the replacement heads that cuts me up! How can Schick justify charging so much for a little piece of disposable plastic? I can buy a bag of 12 full disposable razors of another brand for half the price of 5 silk effect replacement heads. It makes me furious enough that I will buy a brand new Silk Effect razor with refills because they are a better value than buying just the replacement heads only."
2,"Don't be fooled by ""36 inch"" description!","This measurement is taken from the tip of the longest front hoof to the very longest hair on the tail, but it must be laying on a surface to achieve that. The actual body length from chest to rump is only 16 inches.Although this is a very nice stuffed horse, I was looking for a very large stuffed horse for my granddaughter to use to lay around on as a floor pillow and this will only work as a pillow in her toddler bed!So if your looking for a large stuffed horse, bypass this one, especially for the $63.00 price tag."
1,Rip off of one of her own books!,"I disliked this book because its plot was simply a rip-off (and a poor one at that) of Ms. Bianchin's own ""The Marriage Arrangement"" which was excellent. Buy ""The Marriage Arrangement"" & skip this."
5,"Why are these guys still known, 30 years later?","This is one of the best albums Mott ever did, and in includes the vastly superior ORIGINAL version of Ready For Love, One of the Boys, their version of Sweet Jane, and Sea Diver.Sweet Album"
2,Amazon subcontractor shipped wrong product,"i am growing increasingly dissatisfied with amazon's subcontractor sellers. chronic common problems: items ship very very late with no notice or update, and the credit card is charged with no shipment. 100% of my several inquiries have all been the shippers negligence."
5,A Solid Perspective on the World of Jazz--Old and New,"Giddins, the author of the wonderfully detailed and perceptive biography of Bing Crosby, presents, interprets, and contrasts a wide array of topics revolving about the world of jazz: ranging from Rosemary Clooney to Louie Armstrong to the harmonious sibling act, The Boswell Sisters, as well as many essays on the state of jazz.Separately, or in the context of the entire book, Giddins's personal assessments make for provocative reading on a complex, pulsating musical genre.A great read!"
5,I LOVE IT,THIS CHILDHOOD CLASSIC IS A MUST! MADE ME REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND USED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER.
4,"It's ok, i guess.","I ORDERED THIS ALBUM JUST FOR THE SONG SONADORAS BECAUSE THE REAL SINGER THAT SINGS IT ON THE NOVELA,IS NO WHERE.SINCE IM A VERY BIG FAN OF THAT SONG,I DON'T CARE IF ANOTHER GIRL SINGS IT.SO,IF UR LIKE ME,BUY IT."
2,Promises too much,"Not that Bly's book isn't filled with useful information, it is. But it becomes somewhat problematic when he glosses over the difficulties in breaking into freelance commercial writing. He did, however, discuss this in the book's predecessor: The Copywriter's Handbook. Buy Secrets of a Freelance Writer for its invaluable information on the nuts and bolts of ad writing and commercial writing in general. But read it with the premise that cracking open your first commercail acccount(s) is considerably more difficult that the author conveys."
5,Best driver I've ever owned!,"I have quite a collection of drivers out in my garage, including a square head. Most of them are clones, although one is a Cleveland Sport. I'm a 16 handicap and have never been a consistent driver. This club helps me get many more balls in the fairway. It looks and feels great, with a large sweet spot. I tend to slice and this driver helps me go straighter, thanks to the weights in the head of the club. I also am a line drive hitter and am able to get this club up in the air much better. More carry, longer distance. A terrific club for the price."
2,Totally faceless,"This is about as faceless as early 70's boogie/blues rock can get. Second-rate stuff all the way. The second and third albums by this band are a bit better though. There is no doubt that if it were not for Dio going on to bigger and better things, no one would care about this band. If boogie rock is your thing, then stick to bands like Cactus, or Grand Funk. They were much better songwriters and players."
5,Neat!,"My nephew loves this! Good fun all the way around! He is nine now, and has had this since he was six!"
3,It's ok.,After watching Kristen Stewart in the Twilight saga this movie was just ok. She did play the part pretty good.
1,Stinker!!!!,This film was S L O W and pointless. It was actually painful to watch Kristen Stewart try and act the role. Her solution? Jutting frozen jaw and pigeon-toed gate.Simply awful and boring.
5,Different and NEAT!,"My 4 year old and her 'Jack, the pumpkin king' obsession led me to buy this.... I'm glad I did! It's hanging in the entrance and the Santa really takes up most of the picture. My husband didn't even realize the skeleton was there until my daughter pointed it out. It goes w/ the ""Normal"" decor. What you can't see very well is the number locater is 'OOgie Boogie's head. It was worth the buy and I get compliments on it ALL the time! Can be used every December.... no place to put candy in it... just move the head for the numbers. That's enough for me to do anyway."
1,Would have been a good magazine article,"My dogsitter insisted I read this book, exclaiming over Matthew Scully's elogquent writing and the fact that he wrote Sarah Palin's very inspiring acceptance speech at the Republican convention. His material here would have made an interesting speech or in depth article. Yes, his writing is eloquent. Yes, it's an interesting subject. But it takes a right wing Christian turn at every opportunity. It's not spiritual, it's political. It's difficult to read for more than a few pages because you feel yourself being stuffed with this Christian, animal rights viewpoint. Sometimes I choose to read politically slanted biographies or histories, but I know before I start which viewpoint I'll be getting. His book is good and maybe he will get a lot of converts to his way of thinking. I found myself wondering if he had any pets."
1,compartmentalizing,"I'm am a die hard vegan and animal rights activist, and much of what Scully has to say is right on target. However, I can't fully respect the words of a man who so loyaly serves evil bureaucrats like Bush jr and Cheney. Clearly he is very mixed up in his beliefs, or is compartmentalizing the issues in his book, and the rest of his life. Animal rights, racisim, a free market system, poverty, all these issues are conneceted, clearly he doesnt believe so. It's about turing life into a product, a commodity; wether it be human, animal or the earth herself. This man is trying to confuse people who really care. Get truly informed about EVERYTHING and then you'll see why this book is nothing more than compassionate conservatism."
4,Animal rights for conservatives,"It's nice to hear a conservative voice for speak up for animal rights. Vegetarianism is usually associated with political and religious liberals. I am both, but it was refreshing to hear arguments from a new point of view. As for his conservative cred, he was a speech writer for Bush. I think this will help conservatives understand that this issue isn't just a liberal thing."
1,I wish I had known.,I wish I had known when I bought this book that if you aren't a Christian you will likely understand where he is coming from but won't really vibe with the message of the book since it is filled with a lot of talk of god and creationism. I put the book down after the introduction and about the first four pages. Totally not interested. I just thought I would share for those of your who don't really like reading that sort of thing.
5,"Not your typical ""animal rights"" screed","Like a lot of conservatives, I have tended to dismiss most ""animal rights"" people as fanatics or extremists, because too often they want to put animals on the same level as human beings. Mr. Scully's book is different from 99% of the other animal rights books at Amazon because he is not coming from that perspective AT ALL, and in fact spends some time discussing the problems with that kind of thinking. What he IS saying - and it makes a lot of sense - is that it is precisely because human beings ARE superior to animals that we owe them compassion and respect - and he gives graphic examples of how we are failing in that regard (factory farms, unnecessary hunting, etc.). If you believe that God's mercy extends even to the humblest of His creatures, this is a book you MUST read."
5,winderful product!,"This is a great video, my 2 year old loves them! She'll watch them all day and its great that she's learing signs too! She now can teach others people signs."
4,hugely accessible worldbeat,"to be honest i bought this entirely because jaz coleman's name is attached to it (he's the frontman of killing joke, the band that started the industrial rock genre). also because i once bumped into Oceania singer Hinewehi Mohi at a Killing Joke show (she was taking singing lessons from Mr Coleman at the time - a very nice lady). This album is infinitely better than i expected. Hiniwehi's voice is astonishing (take note, Celine Dion, Faith Hill, etc.). The musical arrangement hypnotic. And the blending of Maori and western sounds makes for fascinating listening (listen out for the Haka in track 2: it makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck). Oceania doesn't take any getting used to, it's as instant as anything I've bought this year. Great work, Mr. Coleman. All I need now is a Killing Joke reunion and you'll have made my millennium."
4,pleasing,"This CD takes a few listens to grab onto you, but when it does, you're hooked. I don't think there is anything else like it on the market today. What one can only assume is traditional maori melodies and drums are mixed expertly with electronica, Deep Forest style.The album insert is very interesting to read as well."
1,Stinks.,"After listening to the music contained on this CD, I have come to the firm conclusion that this music stinks. Who wants this vile trash, anyway? Why does a recording company pay to record such obviously atrocious music and release such a shoddy product? I do not understand."
3,Lisa Minelli,I remember this TV show back in the early 70's. I thought it wonderful at the time. However memories are best left alone. I don't care for this CD at all
3,"Fantastic, informative and nostaglic all at the same time",Great book!! Brought back a lot of childhood memories of watching baseball with my grandparents. This book provided a lot of insight from the players and fans perspectives. Amazing how many series and games that post-season were determined literally by one pitch.
1,Terrible!,"It is honestly the worst razor I've ever used. It only lasted a week and a half before I replaced it with a Venus. I was out the money spent on the razor and the refills I bought at the same time, but it was not worth dealing with its poor quality shaves until I used them up. MAYBE this razor would work for someone with light, fine hair, but it definitely does not work for dark, thick hair. What a joke of a razor!"
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this razor because it was reasonably priced and it said it was mildew resistant. When I opened it, I couldn't believe there were wires covering the blades! I thought it was a mistake and wondered how I could possibly get a close shave with those wires in the way. Well, I cannot get a close shave with this razor and I will now go out and buy the Venus Divine and give that a try. This razor would've been great if it weren't for the unnecessary wires covering the blades, because it even came with a cute holder for the shower. Don't waste your money."
3,Vanilla Flavor Too Strong,I bought this coffee thinking that it would have a hint of vanilla but it ended up being a very powerful flavor in the coffee. The scent of vanilla was so strong that I had to keep the pods in an air tight container or else the whole kitchen would smell like vanilla. Besides that it was a very good quality of coffee and tasted great despite the heavy flavor of vanilla.
1,"Stale, flat, unprofitable...","Flat coffee taste, artificial vanilla, blah. Of all the pods I've tried in my Senseo, these are the worst."
5,WONDERFUL COFFEE/ EASY TO USE,Living alone and having fresh cup anytime I like or make a fesh cup when a friend pops in. AWESOME
4,My wife Loves this stuff,"She finds it a little strong, but enjoys the favor (after buckets of cream and scoops of sugar). I personally tend towards strong, strait coffee."
3,where the beef?,"The author makes good use of describing multiple studies that support some amazing mental powers that the human mind appears to be capable of performing. Unfortunately, none of the studies are sufficiently referenced to allow an interested reader to review the actual data. A more detailed account of the experimental set up, control group, number of participants, etc. along with the actual data would have allowed a skeptical reader to assess the validity independently, rather than accepting the ""highly statistically significant"" conclusion the author presents. Extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence. While I believe the evidence may be there, the author does not make the ""ordinary"" effort to share this important information with her readers. Even an appendix with more detail would have been useful. I was left wanting for more than just an appetizer, how about some real beef!"
2,Dead Boring,"This book reads like a bad script for an old made-for-tv movie. I can visualize Connie Selleca wondering around in a daze, with Dave behind her yelling ""Brown Eyes."" By a few pages, I had begun to become irritated with the heroine. At the middle, I was hoping that the murderer would kill off ""Brown Eyes"" and the rest of the predictable, flat cast of characters. Unfortunately, I'm the type who has to see a book or movie through to the end. So, I felt compelled to complete this drival. In this day and age, you expect writers to create female characters that are smart and edgy. If these are some of your expectations for a novel, don't pick this title off the shelves."
3,It's OK,I bought this as my first telescope and I am going through a learning curve.I thought I would be able to see a lot more than I canwith this little scope.It's small and easy to use.It's light.It's hard to get the finder lined up correctly.Other than that it's cute but I think I'd spend a few hundred more and get a 6 or 8 inch next time.
5,CD/DVD cabinet,I shopped many places looking for this type cabinet but found it on Amazon. It is just as advertised. I received it in new condition. It was easy to put together but follow the instructions. I am very pleased with this.
3,Fine,"When Larry and his friends found an old bottle of INSTANT TAN, they rubbed it. One day, they notice black hair growing... growing.... growing!"
3,Too much for a beginner,"This book is very technical and goes into a great depth of the ""business"" end of running your own company. It is not a good book for someone who's just beginning and just wants basic information about the event planning business in general. For my needs Affairs of the Heart by Nancy Gluck was a much more insightful book."
1,Lasted less than 4 months,After having research spark plugs I settled on these thinking they were the best. I installed them in a 2004 Surburban 1500. Everything seemed great for the first 2-3 months then I noticed the engine was running rough. Took it into my Chevy dealer and the tech said the plugs needed to be replaced. I told him they were brand new plugs and his comment was other manufacture plugs have been causing problems and he recommended GM parts. Had the plugs replaced and haven't had an issue since.
4,good book,"good book, lots of songs. For me, the print is a little small, I like the bigger print style in some of the other fake books, but maybe some people like the smaller print and it makes for a smaller book to lug around. Also, some of these songs are short versions. An example is ""Silver Bells"". It does not have the first part. (""Christmas makes me feel emotional""...etc). Instead, it starts with "" City sidewalks, city..."" or whatever those words are. Still, for playing a Christmas gig where people might ask for any Christmas song, this is a valuable tool. I am glad I bought it."
5,music,"We opened the book and played the songs, they sounded beautiful the book is perfect for our bells!!! We sounded like professionals is was so nice not to have to transpose!!"
3,Disappointed!,In my opinion this book is not for a person that has eyesight problems or recently started learning to play the keyboard. The print is very very small and the notes are not marked. Making it very difficult to see. I would not have purchased it had I realized this. I have been using books by Scott Houston the Piano Guy and thought this would be in that format. But I was unable to find one of Scott's books with Christmas songs. All were sold out and therefore I purchased this one. That old saying...Once bit twice shy.. applies to Hal Leonard's books I will not buy them again.
2,Grossly Overpriced,"This same hose, made by several manufacturers with hundreds of distributors, is marketed in at least four diameters, and sold as either sump pump hose or bilge pump hose. It is the same hose,but the price varies phenomenally depending on the supplier. This particular selection is way overpriced strictly because it's marketed as a ""boat item."" The exact same hose is readily available in local hardware stores for a fraction of the price, sold as ""sump pump hose."""
3,Disappointed,"I eagerly looked forwatrd to this book . I had read Bel Canto and was blown away by the writing of Ann Patchett. I agree with all the reviewers who were disappointed as I was. I didn't connect with any of the characters and the writing was good but not outstanding. The ending was weak and the majority of the book was flat. I had read Patchett's Truth and Beauty which I thought was well written and more coherent than the Patron Saint. All in all, even though I wasn't imnpressed by this book I will read Magician's Assistant, because I want to find that beautiful author of Bel Canto again."
5,Ann Patchett does it again!,"While the story was a little slow getting going, it's been a treat to sit down and get to the next chapter and the next. It's a good story told well. I'm looking forward to the ending, hoping it's optimistic."
2,endearing characters need not apply,"I couldn't figure out why she waited until she was pregnant to walk away - then couldn't figure out why she married Son - then after marrying so she could keep her baby, she deserts her daughter (in more ways than one). There just were no characters that I particularly liked in this book, except maybe the aged nun who just kept doing her thing. I never felt any emotion and none of the characters seemed to either. It was no more than a story of a woman whose life continues to go wrong and never gets any better."
5,Great Product,"This product is not just for beginners. The product comes with two Tantus Silk Dildos, the small and medium, and easily accommodates the large with changing out the O-ring. It also will accommodate many other types of dildos with a flared base.The straps are very adjustable and will fit larger hips and thighs. Once on and tightened there is very little movement so you can be a little more aggressive.The mini vibe (per my wife) is strong and the placement is ""very nice"".This is a very good product not only in design and function but also in intangible qualities. Since we purchased one our intimate relationship has become surprisingly better. Ours is not about dominance and submission it is more role reversal and pleasure. Don't knock until you try it."
4,Came as described,"It was a LOT smaller than I was expecting. The smallest one no bigger than my pinky finger... the larger one the width of two fingers put together. Suction cup-y. The harness it comes with is good for absolute beginners, but for people who have better quality aka Aslan harnesses, will just laugh. I keep the harness around for a bit of a joke (but also a stand by... just in case I can't use my other two!) Anyway, I wish they put a reference in the photo to show how big it would be... otherwise I might not have gotten it.For absolute cold beginners: Yes.For intermediate/advanced/pros: NO."
5,Lessoned Learned,"I enjoyed reading Snowed, A Lesson In Love because it touched upon real issues effecting women today. I, like the character Michelle, am living with HIV, which I also contracted from my husband. Only difference is he is a DL brother. It takes a lot of guts to put issues like this out there for readers to hear and I am so glad Snowed did. I wished I had learned my lesson in love before I met my husband, but this experience itself is a lesson learned. I took a chance on this book and I am glad I did. What a wonderful story! Thank you Nishawnda, for putting it out there."
5,Basic good quaility plastic hose,"This was for a secondary bilge pump setup. Works well and sealed quickly. Boat didn't sink and nobody died, so that was a bonus."
4,Unexpected News,"Robert McAfee Brown wrote this difinitive book about Liberation Theology. At a time during the Cold War and when many South American countries were under the iron hand of a dictator, some people of faith in Central and Sout America began to articulate the biblical message of justice. It states that the Christian faith is not just private and personal but pubic and political as well.Robert McFee is regarded as the articulator for Liberation Theology in our time. An excellent book."
5,life changing!!,it was life changing for me.The thoughts and insights will be with me forever.How the world would change for the better if all of us used the understandings in this movie.
3,"Great start, tedious middle, crappy ending","This actually started out as one of the best books I have read in some time. Superb writing and interesting characters. Someplace in the middle, though, it starts to get tedious, and then just as it appears the story is going someplace again it falls completely off track."
2,Disappointing,"I, like many other reviewers, bought this book after reading favorable reviews in major publications.It was one of the worst books I have read. I felt no affinity with the narrator and found him strange and even off-putting. The story unfolded tediously, painfully and with few hooks to keep me turning the page. In the end, I had to force myself to finish it-- and was left completely unsatisfied upon finishing.Find something else to read this summer!"
3,"Frightening, original, but annoying","I didn't mind the fact that this book didn't have a plot that made sense. But, after reading it I expected to get more out of it than I did. I feel more questions are unanswered than insites gained. I did like observing the horror of just how with wealth and power one can persue absurd? ridiculous? aims and goals. I didn't understand the title; the fascination with ""recidual"" except that residual sort of means remainder; the water image on the cover; what of the decintegration of Naz as a human being? Maybe it means that when you buy into madness just because it is the easy way, you go mad yourself.I am in agreement with a previous reviewer: in parts I thought this was a dream of someone dying or in a psychotic hospital. The horror comes when you think he's alive."
3,Strange - Intriguing - Boring - Pointless - Worthwhile?,"This is a strange book. I won't go over the plot or lack of, that's been dealt with in the other reviews. I'm not bothered by a lack of plot. I just can't decide if the book was worth reading. I'm not one of those people that has to finish a book if I've started it but I did finish Remainder, thus the three stars instead of two or one. The main character is totally amoral. It's not that he is bad or good; he's just trying to be REAL and AUTHENTIC. That was the facsination of this book for me; it poses, indirectly, the question of what is reality and is anyone really authentic. The truth is I enjoyed talking about the book with my wife more then I did reading it. Hm ....... I'll stick to Murakami."
2,Meh. It's okay,"This book was a recommendation to me and although it's very well written, I just couldn't get into it. The main character is not meant to be likable, but pretty early on I just stop caring about him. And when you stop caring about what happens, it's hard to remain focused on the book. It just felt like it dragged on and on before finally reaching it's denouement. Maybe that was the feel the author was going for, but it's hard for me to get into a story that drones on. It might be for other people, but just not for me."
5,a great lopper,this is a fantastic piece of equipment that anyone can use. i borrowed this object from a friend and found that it pruned with the greatest of ease. just one pump of this lopper and your branch is cut. and very sharp also. this works great on rose bushes with larger branches that just trimmers cannot get. when my son used this he just had to have one also so i purchased one for him. he loves it. this is a must garden tool to have
5,This bed is FUN!,"Length:: 0:24 MinsMy two beagles, Tommy Tunes and Freddy Girl LOVE this bed. It's a medium size, just right for a beagle."
5,"Awesome sound, great price!","You can not go wrong with these speakers.Great sound, very powerfull as well.I use them as front speakers, matched with a pair of Bose 301 in the back, a subwoofer and a klipsh rc 35 as a center.Very distinctive highs and deep base.For more info:[...]"
5,Best portable/storable kayak,Extremely sturdy and durable. Held the air with two people. Paddles were wonderful. Great fun had by all. Easy to pump w/ an electric pump.
4,Great to those with a convertible car!,"Takes about 5 minutes to inflate. Great for exercise and cruising on the lake. I will upgrade and buy different paddles since they are very basic and cheap, but the kayak is great! Highly recommend for those with limited car or storage space."
5,Loads of Fun for the whole family,"Took it to the beach and it was really easy to inflate and get in to the water. The whole family really enjoyed it, even my son who rarely joins in on such outings. Handled very well and I did not have any problem with the oars, as I thought I might after reading other reviews. Also the seats are really comfortable. Highly recommend this product!!"
5,Great for small lake!!!,"I live in a neighborhood with a 40 acre lake. This is perfect for that. I also bought the single kayak and the pump which is a must! I love the fact that if you aren't going to use it for a few days you can let out the air, fold it up and put it out of the way. Very sturdy."
1,Terrible--should not give any stars,"Be warned! My daughter naively bought this book that was required for a college English class. She only got to page 8 when she called in tears saying it was so disturbing she couldn't read it anymore and she has read a lot of literature in her college career! Even the professor said it took him about 14 times of reading it to become ""numb"" to the content. He even told the class to have a Disney movie nearby because the book was so disturbing. The language used in this book is offensive and explicit. If you are offended by the F-word then do not look at a single page of this book. If there is a lesson to be learned from this book it is too hard to find in the filth. If a class requires this book--beware and be warned! We should have researched the book more before buying it."
2,A Slight Disappointment,"I truly looked forward to reading Mister Duff's book. O dear. It was cliched, and shallow, and inhabited by cardboard stereotypes. The poignancy that should have there with the wife-battering and daughter-raping and general dereliction of all concerned was undermined (I'd love to think deliberately dears) by the author's sad imitation of his betters."
3,Not as pictured,"What you will get, is an all blue strap.The picture Amazon has shown is incorrect. (I checked other web sites)The coil wire easily stretches, but I would recommend hooking to a wall outlet (ground pin only) extension wire; up to you.The strap does itch a little, but that is the nature of the beast, as this is howthe static is discharged (metal contact with your skin)."
2,Not the best a man can get!,"I decided to buy these in bulk at Sam's Club considering they were about half the price point as the Gillete Mach 3.They feel about half the price point. They wear out sooner, don't give as clean a shave, and feel cheaper. I'd recommend paying the extra bucks to get the Mach 3."
3,a Modest Proposal,"Michael Grant's book which attempts to uncover historical details about St. Peter makes modest claims about the touted head of the Christian church. Grant examines the Gospel view of Peter, which is not very flattering. He writes that this view had to do with the Gentile influence. Nevertheless Grant maintains that Peter did lead the early Christians in Jerusalem, although this leadership was short-lived due to what Grant bellieve to be Peter's role as mediator between rival factions. Grant can find little evidence that Peter lived and died in Rome, but he avers that this may be very likely since the tradition concerning it so strong.While not a long book, St. Peter: A Biography makes a modest proposal that the tradition concerning this Apostle may baasically be historically true."
2,Grant never finds certainty,"By Grant's testament, matters of God are matters of probability. By matters of God, Grant probably doesn't exist"
4,uneven and amazing!,"And so it begins. ""Spirits in the Night"". Is there a better song about being young, going out to ""party""? It is SO much more than sex. Hhits it then, and it still works today. ""For You""? Isn't this so much more ""real"" than ANYTHING out there today? ""Lost in the Flood""? Who speaks with this passion anymore?No, it isn't perfect; no, it isn't his best; no, it isn't ""essential"". But the seeds are planted; It is raw, poetic, soulful, full of the sounds of a man that had NO interest in making ""hit"" music; he wanted to say what he wanted to say. They just don't make many like this anymore."
3,A 3 star album with 5 star moments,"With it's dense-packed lyrics and folky musical feel, Bruce's debut was an album that barely hinted at what was to come. Caught between the record company's desire to make a singer/songwriter out of him and his own desire to be a flat out rocker, Greetings comes out sounding uneven, but despite this several songs manage to creep out as flat out classics. Future Manfred Mann fodder Blinded By The Light and For You hinted at his genius, but in my opinion Growin' Up, Spirit In The Night and It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City confirmed that what we were dealing with was the next big thing."
3,"Lyrically precocious, but still pretty darn good","Contrary to most of the reviews here, this is NOT a must have unless you want to see a side of Springnsteen's music you haven't seen before: The wild and woolly, funky party-rocker who dropped acid on the weekends and was scared to death of getting drafted. It's a good record, more honest and more sincerely fun than almost anything new I've heard in years -- but it don't top ""The Wild, The Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle""."
3,"Young Bruce, trying a bit too hard","With the rambling, stream of consciousness lyrics on GREETINGS you can feel Springsteen pressing a bit. For every wondrous street poem like ""Spirit in the Night,"" or ""Lost in the Flood,"" you have the odd imagery of ""Mary Queen of Arkansas,"" or the rather bizarre rambling of ""The Angel,"" a song that seems interminable and it only clocks in at 3:23. There are definitely enough wonderful songs here to see the potential, but some of it is just a bit ponderous and has not aged well. Still, it definitely has its merits and is well worth your time to hear how one of America's greatest rockers began his career."
2,Wow,"Wow is not a good thing! I'll give them this, they are water proof for the first week or so. With that being said...I work in a distribution center for a big corporation, mainly with meat boxes and produce crates. I've only had my gloves maybe a good month and they are already torn badly! Wish I could post a pic. No longer water proof and only keep your hands warm in mild temperatures! The group is gone after the first few hours of work. I could go on and on about them, but lets just say I won't be buying another pair! Not worth the $30."
2,poorly made,"Tried these on upon taking delivery, the inside liner is trying to come out when you take the off, do not expect the to last."
3,winter?,Not really warm enough for winter use but seem well made and they fit snug for a xxl. seem kind of expensive for what they are.
4,"THE BOXCAR CHILDREN, THE CABOOSE MYSTERY","These books are memory making adventures that most kids seem to fall into. I read a few of them as a child, but I don't remember them being a series of mysteries. The girls I care for (6 yr. old twins) totally fell in love with them. I ordered used copies and they arrived quickly and in fairly good shape. The only problem encountered was the binding in one of the books is so old the pages are falling out. That is not anyone's fault, so no worries on this end. We will continue to purchase them as we read through the series."
5,"Very good ""sleeper"" movie","This was a very good, but little known, movie. Whenever I talk about it, I have never met anyone else who has seen it. It's really a shame, because it IS a good movie."
3,Errata link for this book,"I love this book from its pictures, but I read the reviews here and checked out the errata sheets on the internet. Here is a link from the publisher to correct the mistakes.[....]With the availability of corrections, I'll buy this book. I rated 3 stars because I had to give a rating, not because it means anything. I really like her pieces and probably will rate this book higher afterwards.As for errata being present, it is somewhat hard to edit even easy knitting patterns, so I am willing to cut the publisher some slack with these odd modular designs."
3,Beautiful but filled with errors,"My initial read of the book wowed me. I've long combined my own love of math with a passion for knitting so I felt instantly at home with Norah's approach. The book has inspired me to incorporate some of the concepts into my own designs. However, I don't recommend attempting to knit directly from the patterns. They contain so many errors that it's clear no one tested the patterns before publication. This is very disappointing for such an expensive and beautifully designed book."
4,Pattern Issues,"This is a beautiful book! The photography is stunning, the projects are amazing. The issue is that for a book this beautiful, there are a lot of issues with the patterns. The errata is mind boggling. Now, this may be fixed in later additions, but I expected a lot better pattern checking. If you don't mind trolling in the internet or emailing the publisher for the errata (they sent in within a couple days via email) then buy the book. The projects really are beautiful and it makes a great coffee table book."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product, prompt shipping, and very pleasant retailer to work with. Thanks for all your help....product is exactly shown as in picture"
1,"Oddly enough, Nash version not the best","Although Johnny Nash wrote this diddy, I'd have to rank hisversion as a poor fourth to three others. Too many ""yo, yo yos""is part of his problem in trying to sing his own song. His voice also isn't a particulary good one - he can't hold a note for any length of time and he can't accentuate his stops the way this song requires. What an irony, but then again, Hoagy Carmichael would never be my first choice for any of his songs either. Thiscertainly isn't the first time a song found better nterpretation by someone other than the composer. Several of Simon's songs(of Simon and Garfunkel) were given superior treatments by others."
2,G. Roth's self-involvement is getting boring.,"I learned a lot from Ms. Roth's previous books, but except for a few select chapters (the best was about her first editor), this book was incredibly narcissistic. I don't care to hear how many fireplaces Ms. Roth has in her new house, the tiffs she has with a friend (another well educated, got everything YUPPIE), and if she does decide to have a baby after decades of blathering about the reasons to not have one, PLEASE DON'T WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT! Enough. Ms. Roth is starting to remind me of an incredibly self-absorbed 5-year-old. The people who inhabit her world are only there to compliment her existence. I'm glad I don't know her personally. Being around her must be an energy draining trial."
1,"For Under $10.00 , I guess you can't go Wrong","The item came damaged , stained, color is actually lighter than picture on Amazon. Not Happy at All!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The end of a silly show...,"I collected the entire series because I was bored and had money to throw away (not anymore now), but for everyone else on a fixed income. I suggest you just rent the first one to see what the rest of the other six DvDs has to offer. Since everyone of them is pretty much the same."
4,"Gouda, baby, gouda","Every so often, my inner Goth child cries out for love, and he's best satisfied with a taste of this South African import. But this is not what Marilyn Manson would have you believe is Goth, which is nothing more than petulance wrapped up in rants of manufactured angst; this is to Marilyn Manson what Gouda is to Velveeta."
2,Pgroiner burned me...,I'm a man of my word while others tend not to be. Pgroiner left the fold because he's a metal wannabe head banging bozo. I'm still waiting for the live concerts Razor Deep...man of your word.
3,Excellent but not worth $17,"I have bought these on sale for $9.99 and I would buy again at that price. They truly are excellent, but $17 is a little ridiculous unless you have so much money that you will pay an outrageous price for anything that you desire"
2,Spiritworks,Dr. vines book is a rehash of a 60's book by W.A. Criswell with the addition of the views of John McArthur.It is narrow and sectarian. Perhaps this most alarming thing is Dr. Vines statement that one cannot get doctrine from the book of Acts. Dr. Vines also uses the false story that Toronto University Language school has discredited the gift of tongues. I called the university and they deny any such study. This book is sermonic not schorlarly-it is the cessationist view at its worst. Vines claim to speak for Southern baptists is arrogant-His admission that right or wrong his baptist heritage ranks above scripture is interesting in light of baptist high regard for scripture.
3,Grab your dictionary,"This book is very fast reading, but I have never had to look up so many words in a dictionary while reading a novel before, not to mention some of them weren't in it when I looked them up! (a good one to read to expand your vocabulary if you want to take the GRE!) I guess it added to the whole feel of the book, but the odd words, lack of punctuation, and some sentences that no matter how poetic, simply didn't make sense, made it a bit more perplexing than I'd prefer. I also, would have liked to have had some idea of what caused such over-arching catastrophe on the earth; and keeping in mood with the entire book, I guess the ending fit right in...it was thought-provoking, and I was moved by the boy's ability to maintain high moral standards and love of humanity despite growing up in the charred world they were traveling in."
5,Savage and Beautiful,"The Road is one of the best works of fiction I have read in many years. It is a story of raw physical survival. While the catastrophe which occurred is never named, the description fits perfectly that of the ""nuclear winter"" predicted by scientists to follow a nuclear war. This is not however, a postapocalyptic vision in the tradition of ""Mad Max"" and a hundred other B movies. It is a realistic view of a father's love for his young son, and the things he must do to try to protect him and keep him alive in this nightmare landscape. At once stark, disturbing, heartbreaking, beautiful, and thought provoking, it is a story which has lingered in my mind long after finishing it."
5,IT'S OKAY!!!,"I'm not a literary giant but I thought this book was brilliant. To me McCarthy used the the most frightening and the most perfect setting for the story. Preparation and hope for the future is the message I received. What we try to do as parents is give our children love and preparation for their world, their road, when we're gone. Papa did it! It's OKAY was the key. The boy was the hope and he was ready. One of the best books I've ever read."
1,Bestseller in the most boring book category,"I got hold of this book because of Oprah's recommendation. I was bored to death therefore I quit reading it. I had to re-check Oprah's website if this was indeed one of the books she recommended because I thought maybe I made a mistake. Oh yes indeed. I do not understand why she found this book worthy to read. I have to agree with one of the reviewers that a book awarded by the Pulitzer Award is not a guaranteed good read. This is the 2nd book I read which won a Pulitzer Prize which I didn't find worthy of my time. If there was a list to come up with the most boring books ever read, I would nominate this on top of the list."
4,"Depressing and sad, but engaging","A very entertaining and interesting book, I honestly felt like I needed to keep reading to find out what happened to the father and son. But wow, it was depressing and dark, even to the point that at times I did not want to continue reading. It has a draw to it that makes you want to, it makes you care about the man and child, which is especially amazing due to the fact they are never named and you never know their full backstory.Definitely worth the money and time I spent reading this, certainly an engaging read."
4,Horror literature,"Enough reviews already, so I'll cut to the chase. The style. It's actually easier than most Cormac McCarthy. Sentences are cut. Descriptions lapidary. Single words. But it fits the bare and depleted world of The Road. It works.The story is horrifying. Rape, impalements, cannibals: that sort of thing. It doesn't pretend to psychological or even anthropological veracity. The apocalypse that has taken place isn't explained. It is there for the thrill, and a good, scary, first-class thrill is what you will get.For a subtler, more argued, and emotionally filled version of a post-cataclysm world, see Auster's In the Country of Last Things. Then there is Kurt Vonnegut's Player Piano, which will make you reflect how much American culture has changed since the 1950s."
5,Magnificent? Yes,"I enjoyed it immensely and the story line and characters will remain with me for a long, long while ... and yes, it is a book to be shared and discussed!"
3,Could have been much better.,"After all the hoopla that was surrounding this, I was pretty surprised when I read the book. Like others with negative reviews have also mentioned, his grammar, or lack of, is pretty strange. That aside, a good fifty percent of the book is filled with descriptions of the ash that occupies their world.The reason it gets three, instead of one star from me is because the book was not completely devoid of any thought provoking segments. Some parts of the story present certain events which make you think how you would react in that situation. If you would become a product of your environment or if you would remain ""the good guy"", and if keeping your set of morals would ultimately lead to your demise.It was an interesting topic, and I still think they could make a good movie out of this, but it could have been presented in a much better way than was done in this book."
1,"Dismal, Dreary, Dull, and Drab","This is a pointless narative of a journey through a dead world. There really is no story. There is no beginning, since we never even know what destroyed the world. There is no end since there is nothing at the end of the journey. It probably made a ""good"" movie, which I don't intend to see, since the scenes would be perfect for lots of gruesome special effects and loud noises when something unexpected happens. It seems to be raining or snowing all the time, but the sun never shines through the smoke and ash, so I wonder how water gets evaporated to form the clouds. I would recommend One Second After or Alas, Babylon or Lights Out online at FrugalSquirrel"
1,THE ROAD,"THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ. THE MAIN CHARACTERS DO NOT HAVE NAMES OR AGES. THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS ""BOY"", THE ""MAN"" OR ""PAPA"". PRESUMABLE THEY ARE IN AMERICA BUT AGAIN WHO KNOWS. ONE ASSUMES THE DISASTER IS NUCLEAR WINTER BUT WHO KNOWS? DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
3,3 and 1/2???,"I don't think the writing style is my cup of tea. It still kept my interest, and it certainly wasn't a ""bad"" book."
4,Post Apocalytpic Roaming,"I expected another good read from this Cormac McCarthy book and as usual he did not disappoint. If you're looking for optimism or to be uplifted, steer clear of this novel. If you can appreciate a masterly set tone of isolation and despair, a brilliant exploration of survival instincts, and a somber ode to parental love in a post apocalyptic setting, this is just the book for you."
2,Not Good,"I just didn't get this book. I found it difficult to read, I found the story boring, and the overall premise confusing. Here is the plot:Walking --> Tired --> Sleep --> Rain --> Walking --> Hungry --> House --> People? --> Walking (repeat)"
2,Not up to McCarthy's usual standards,I normally like McCarthy's books but this one doesn't make any sense. Why would every living thing but way too many starving humans be killed by whatever it is that happened? And why does he leave it a mystery what the cause of the mass extinction was?
2,Incredibly depressing,"It's hard to know what rating to give this book. Picture a post-nuclear burned earth, with only a few people, and most of them cannibalizing the others. Write about it with poetic beauty, and have it end tragically. The English teacher in me loved the beautiful word choices, but I never did get used to the prolific use of sentence fragments.I'm not sorry I read it, but I couldn't really recommend it, either."
5,Tragically Beautiful...,"'The Road', by Cormac McCarthy, is an incredibly unique and profound piece of literature. Its simplicity and accessible humanity reminds the reader that pain, loss, and redemption never lie too far apart. McCarthy masters the art of depicting a grossly familiar landscape without underestimating the intelligence or imagination of his audience, while constantly placing the reader in a delicious state of doubt and unease. It is refreshing to visit the nameless truth set forth by McCarthy, and an honor to have known these pages."
5,A book you won't soon forget,"While The Road is dark and frightening, it is ultimately a powerful love story. A man's love for his son keeps him moving and searching for some kind of a future in a world without hope.I found the writing style to be brilliant. After all, what need is there for pretty extras like apostrophes, commas, and names in the face of such apocalyptic devastation?The story is both heart-breaking and thought-provoking. It makes you think about what would you do? And is there any point? This book stays with you long after you've read the last page."
1,Awful Book,"I won't spend much time agreeing with the other reviewers, which I do, who gave this one a single star -- though I would give it a zero if I could. A dreadful, dull, endlessly repetitive assertion that, at bottom, the best human kind is capable of is survival without reason (except perhaps to try to enable someone else to survive, an enterprise that turns out to be useless as well) and that the worst is a choking, horrible predisposition for doing individual and organized evil to others who come within their reach. The glints of something else in this book are few and artificial when they appear. Bottom line of the parable: humans are vicious, terrible creatures and doomed to stay that way. That is, why bother living when doing so is utterly senseless? People who think this way are or should be on medication. Want to consider doing away with yourself? Then this is for you. Otherwise, skip it -- or, better, round up copies and burn them to keep reading children from harm."
5,Word Perfect,Spare and grim and word-perfect. This clear classic is made transcendent by the last two paragraphs. Bravo.
5,Masterpiece,"Very spare and precise, unsentimental writing. The language, like the landscape is stripped bare; few adjectives or descriptive embellishments, and this contributes to the overall bleakness of the narrative. Absolutely first rate."
2,Overated book,I probably had a huge expectation on the book as so many people talk really good things about it but the truth is I found it hard to go over some chapters and I really thing it is generally overated
2,Just Watch the Movie,"I got this book because I wanted to read is truly sad story... and it was also dirt cheap. I liked the post-apocalyptic setting. It reminded me of Konami's Silent Hill video game series. I began the book with a lot of enthusiasm, but that feeling soon faded as I turned each page. I found myself dragging along through some parts of the story waiting for something to happen. It was an okay story, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to read it. I also realized the style of writing in the book, and I didn't like it. This is only my own preference though, so others may find it enjoyable."
4,awesome novel..... one complaint at the author,i loved this book. it was incredible. i even CRIED at the end for pete's sake. but the fact that cormac mccarthy DOESN'T USE QUOTATION MARKS pisses me off SO bad. other than that this book was flawless. its not that hard! lol
3,Not My Favorite McCarthy Book,"I was so surprised when I finished this book. Not by the storyline, but by everyone's glowing reviews of praise and accolades. I am a huge Cormac McCarthy fan, and of course expected this to be his finest work yet based on what everyone was saying. But, I was really disappointed. I feel bad saying it, but I thought this book was really lacking. I realize this wasn't a dialogue driven book, but the dialogue that was there was so one dimensional and flat. I wasn't seeing this deep, poignant relationship everyone was raving about. I also just felt the writing wasn't what McCarthy usually delivers. I mean, don't get me wrong, he transported me to a bleak and terrible unending place, but I still felt like things were so stale. Maybe that was his point. Either way, I'm definitely glad I added another McCarthy book to my collection, and it just makes me look forward to his next one more."
1,Really unsatisfying,"It's a book about a guy and his son who are walking somewhere for no reason. For some reason, everything is dead and destroyed, but you never find out why. Everyone is miserable, and they have to fight for survival, but yet they also have to keep walking. I kept reading it, hoping that something would finally get explained... it never happened. The ending was both depressing and doesn't explain anything. Very unsatisfying.The whole concept reminds me of that movie Ron Howard was attached to direct: ""It's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason"" - ""did I mention his best friend is a talking pie?""Maybe I'm not cultured enough to ""get it"" -- but The Road was one of the worst books I've ever read."
2,movie is better that the book - yeah I said it,"I enjoy reading novels prior to watching the movie - kindof my little reward for finishing the book. I liked the book but felt that I really never got to know the charachters very well. There is not a lot of descriptive writing about the dad and boy. Most of the book revolved around eating and being cold. The movie however I felt I understood more about who the characters were and how they felt. If you like novels with conversation shy away for this one - 2-3 word questions and reponses. Overal ""The Road"" was worth reading to prep to see the movie but I do not think I would buy another McCarthy novel."
2,This was tedious,"No, I don't buy into the ""Oprah chose it, so it must be good"" thought. Neither do I think the Pulitzer prize means much these days. The truth is that this book did not impact me like it apparently did others. The dialogue is so overtly simple that it's painful and the descriptions are so repetitive.(Question: How many times do they say OK? Answer: As many times as he talks about the ash.)His style is so easy to copy that one wonders, ""what, then, is the big deal?"" This is like modern art (You know, those splatterings of paint on a canvas that people call ""art"" and they read into it any artistic interpretation that comes to mind, when in reality it really is just blots on canvas). This book is like that, to me. If you want to overanalyze it and call it ""profound"", that's fine, but the reality is that this is a poorly told story with little or not literary value.I've read ""The Border Trilogy"" and wasn't too thrilled with those books either. I guess I'm done with McCarthy. BLEH"
3,The Road,"This month's book club leader chose it. Something I probably never would have read. That is what makes being in a book club and others choosing each month fun. It was an ""interesting"" book. I found it very slow at the beginning. As I got into it I could not put it down. I needed to know what was going to happen to the characters. The love between father and son was very strong. I feel the father would have done anything for the son and in a way did. He may have just given up if he did not have his son to protect."
3,Stephen King has done it before and better.,"Nicely written. Simple. Powerful. Why it won a Pulitzer I have no idea since I've read many books that I would consider its equal or better, and Stephen King (not to mention Lyn Venable of that infamous Twilight Zone episode where Burgess Meredith ends up alone in a world with only books, but has broken his glasses and so he can't avail himself of them) has written the same sort of post-apocalyptic tale just as well, many many times, but yes, it was good and affecting."
3,Hasn't this been done before?,"While I think the book is memorable in its prose and story, it feels as if this tale has been told before. It felt way too predictable to me. Maybe it's because I was alive and conscious during the period of time where we seriously feared a nuclear attack, back in the early 80's. Or perhaps I'm just convinced the story this book tells is completely and unavoidably inevitable. That being said, I read the book anyway. I did like the flow of the conversation between the man and his son, and the lack of ""he saids"" or quotation marks only added to the way the pages turned so easily. Ultimately, I would say I enjoyed the book but it's getting more and more difficult to read these books and not want to jump off a bridge at the end. I say, if your mood is one of cautious optimism, go ahead and read it. You'll be OK at the end. But if you're already depressed, skip it. It could be just the story to push you right over the edge."
1,THE MOST OVER RATED BOOK I EVER READ,"Dull, cold, boring, depressing, empty, juiceless, ridiculously forced over-styled 'simple' sentences -- all around an uber self-important novel in its aparent humility. I tried, several times, to finish it -- only because it won so many grand awards - but each page was a pain so I could never go through with it. It makes me wonder about the taste of the people (group of men) who are giving these awards and their (lack of) sensibility. In their literary ivory towers they must have lost sight of the 'real thing.' As for awarding this novel a Pulitzer, the credibility of this award was made irrelevant."
1,"I Know I'm In A Minority, But....","I hated this book. A father and son walk south after the earth was (mostly) destroyed. Their conversations are repetitive and stilted. You will read the following dozens of times: ""I'm scared."" ""I know"". ""Are we going to die?"" ""No.""We never learn where these characters are from, what they expect to find when they get where they are going, lessons they've learned, or any insights whatsoever.There is a strong bond created between father and son, and some touching moments. But there is no payoff for trudging through this desolate, fearful, depressing landscape."
1,Waste of Time,"I just finished reading this book. I feel as though I have wasted 4 hours of my life. I refused to put it down until I finished because I thought there must be a pay-off at the end. I suffered through page after page of the same story. Ash, shopping carts, wrapping up in blankets, rain storm, look for food, hide on the side of the road, go through an abandoned house. Turn and page and repeat. The dialouge between the boy and the man was annoying. ""Papa I'm cold"". ""I know"". ""Okay"". ""Okay"". ""Papa, I'm scared"". ""I know"". ""Okay"". Luckily, I bought the paperback and only wasted $14 instead of $27!"
3,not quite what I expected,"I bought this book after hearing rave reviews about it from several people I know and trust. I can't say that I hated this book but I can say that the hype was misleading. It is the most bleak modern novel I've read in ages. Now, to give the author credit, he may be showing what a post-apocalyptic world would really be like for the survivors--little contact with others and what contact one does have could and usually is dangerous, especially as food supplies dwindle and disappear. However, the endless repetition of walking down ""the road"" can be tedious."
5,Hope,"As a story about a father and son journeying through a post-apocalyptic America, the backdrop is bleak...ashes, death, and despair seep from the surroundings. Then why did Oprah make this one of her picks? Because the father and son, the main characters who remain nameless throughout, highlight the underlying nature of human perseverance and good, even in the face of complete tragedy. And that good ultimately comes back to them by providing shelter, food, and protection when they need it most.Perhaps most important, at least to those who didn't experience the unconditional love of a parent, the total and complete love the father has for his son is something precious, and the backdrop of despair just serves to highlight the beauty of that love. That love is something every child should have, and every parent should read this book and examine how they react when their child makes a mistake."
4,A Review of the Unabridged AUDIO CD OR AUDIO DOWNLOAD version of The Road,"Product Link:The RoadThe Road (Unabridged)This book is sensational (Pulitzer Prize Winner) and the Reader is terrific too. I have only one gripe with this audio book. Although this is unabridged the reader has elected to CHANGE much of the original wording in the book. In one instance, his change even changed the meaning of the sentence!Where does he get off thinking he can take a Pulitzer Prize winning literary gem and improve upon it by changing the words? I like to read along as I listen. I'm suprised the author allowed it.Otherwise the reader IS a superb, great story teller, and this is a read/listen that's not to be missed. If it were not for this one annoying element this easily rates 5 stars in my opinion. If you don't read along, you won't know the difference."
5,A journey,I wasn't expecting to like this book but I was pleasantly shocked. The novel was fantastic and incredibly heart felt from beginning to end.
2,meh,Boring. Where's the narrative? narrative. Beatnik. on they went. snow. on they went. cold. so cold with all this ash. Will we live? live...if only to live...snow. (This is kinda how the book is written)
3,This book was a bummer,"The subject matter is a tough one - especially if you have kids (which I do), but it was well written. Just be prepared for a whole lot of doom and gloom."
2,Ultimately Empty,"My god, somebody give this author some Prozac allready..! I will give him this; he does a good job of describing utter hopelessness. Even me, the eternal optimist, realize after 3 pages that there is just no way this will end well. So what's the point of this book? Why doesn't he stop at page 3? I get the hopelessness.. I get the endelss, grey, nothingness. I get the hopelessness. I get the desparation. I get the hopelessness. I don't, however, get the point."
2,dark,Not as good to me as many said. Only one (depressing) storyline. Quick read though so worht the read just b/c it is unique.g
4,The Road,"Interesting book. Loved the writing. Author kept me guessing all the way through and even now when I think of the book. Am sending it to my brother-in-law who loves to read. It is definitely not a soft and gentle book, but it is one that makes you think. I recommend it highly but be sure to read the synopsis of it before you delve in."
3,NOT a book for the clinically depressed!,"I am a HUGE Cormac McCarthy fan. I've read many of his works so I know well his often dark subject matter. However this is, in my opinion, by far the darkest. I completely agree with s.j.'s earlier assessment; it is exactly like 'falling down a deep, dark hole'. Most likely because this stark and morose book offers little hope for humanity. BUT, I am glad I read it...bleak as it may be. Certainly not a read for everyone though. If you are already on depression meds--stay away!"
3,Haunting,"Although McCarthy writes beautifully and skillfully, this book is still haunting me. It is bleak, dark, and disturbing."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"I rushed to read this book after seeing so many positive reviews, but just do not see what the hype is all about. It is monotonous, tedious, and hasty. I kept reading hoping something would actually happen, but nothing ever does. I must be missing something."
2,Overrated and has no story,"Personally I don't understand the rave reviews this book is getting. Yes, the world it creates is interesting, but the total lack of story drove me crazy. Basically, ""the man"" and ""the boy"" walk, look for food, and hide. Repeat over and over and over. There's no character growth, no real plot or suspense, and nothing about these characters to particulary like. We're given almost no history of either what happened to the world or of the main characters. A very dull read if you ask me. If you're looking for something beyond just a mood piece (that mood being depression), I'd advise looking for something else to read. Try the reviewer above, Dennis Lehane. Now HE is brilliant."
1,Gives new meaning to the word bleak...,"I received this book on fathers day and looked forward to reading it after seeing Oprah's interview with the author. I expected tragic, I expected dark...what I didn't expect was lifeless dialogue, painful repetition, and the annoying grammatical style. This is B action flick material."
3,A lesser work,"I'm about the 679th to review McCarthy's THE ROAD, but -- for what it's worth -- I found the book a little bit disappointing. I didn't dislike it, certainly, but I've read a number of other post-apocalypse novels that I think are much more profound, creative, and imaginative (Russell Hoban's RIDDLEY WALKER, for example, published nearly thirty years ago). McCarthy is without doubt one of America's greatest living novelists, but in my opinion his contribution to the genre is too little and too late."
1,Really?,"I guess I'm somewhat of a pleb, but it's been a while since I've read a book as convoluted and confusing as ""The Road"". Let me start by saying the premise is interesting, which is why I read it in the first place. However, the sentence structure is strange (which is OK in some books, doesn't work for me here), the characters are unsympathetic, and half the time I'm fighting to understand where the protagonists are, who they're talking to, and what they're trying to do. I really must be missing something, as my mind was literally blown when I saw the high ratings that this got. So I'm left here, wondering what on Earth I missed."
3,Depressing,"The clerk in the bookstore told me that she loved this book and devoured in in less than a day. Although it was a quick read, I'm divided as to whether I enjoyed the read. I recently finished ""No Country for Old Men"" and expected something similar.This book would foster a lot of discussion, but I don't know which of my friends would appreciate me passing this book on."
4,It was a good book but I really need to read a happy book now.,Cormac McCarthy is an amazing author but his books are on the depressing side...This was about the most stressful and most depressing books I think I have ever read. But one of the best at the same time.I think the best way for me to describe it is.......you know how when you are reading a book...the suthors descriptions sort of paint a mental picture in your head? Well imagine the author having nothing but a grey scale environment to describe. So everytime you get a description in this book....its...grey....and depressing...and hopeless. Relentlessly grey and hopeless.Amazing book but depressing the whole way through.
4,Superb,As with all Cormac McCarthy books the literary aspect of his writing is fantastic. The images come alive in rich detail and this tale as desperate and depressing as the end of the world could visualise. A true classic that makes you think about what the world will look like if we all do not do our part to ensure peace and secuirty for all of mankind.
2,The Road to Nowhere,"The first thing that struck me was McCarthy's gift for language. There was a poetry in his phrasing (a la Ursela LaGuin). It drew me right in. Unfortunaatly, that was where my pleasure as reader ended. The story is endlessly redundant -- like the author wanted to be sure the reader really got the point. The story line is predictable, and there is little, if any, character development.A novel should contain either strong character development or an engrossing story line (hopefully, both). This novel contained neither.It appears the author took a viable short story idea and attempted to flesh it out to a novel. Sadly, it didn't work. Unless you're a fan of beautiful languiag to the almost complete exclusion of good story and character values, I strongly recommend you pass up ""The Road""."
3,"Disturbing, all-too-timely, but a bit precious","I listened to the unabridged audiobook, a fine performance by Tom Stechschulte.THE ROAD is a bleak and harrowing vision of post-apocalypse America. Unlike the epic treatment of the subject in books like ALAS, BABYLON and EARTH ABIDES, THE ROAD is intimate, focused on the adventures and relationships of a man and his son as they wander a cold, ashen landscape, fighting for survival.McCarthy is a master of concise word-painting. His descriptions of settings and actions are as lean as his starving protagonists. But when he shifts into Poetry with a capital P mode, the sense of you-are-there realism is spoiled. Characters spout profundities, the landscape turns from grey to purple, and you're yanked out of an unthinkable future into the pages of an Important New Work By A Major Author.McCarthy's nightmare is only a few bad decisions away. If this book helps remind a few influential people of this terrible fact, its occasional lapses can be easily forgiven."
5,very bleeeeaaaak novel,i've always been fascinated with end of the world type stories. but none have ever seemed very believable. the road is an exception. i personally loved it.
4,my thoughts still tender,"Well, just finished and to tell the truth most books have a ""percolation period"" with me; that is, will I still be thinking about the book; days, weeks; years later? So it's too early to tell for me but my first reaction is that this is a one -of -a -kind reading experience and I wish I'd savored it more (you don't always realize the good ones until you've finished them days;weeks later).two big words: BEAUTIFULLY BLEAK! I say read it and be moved.maybe really 4. 5 stars. Best end of world book: SWAN SONG: Mccammon"
2,Dark Book with Not Much of a Plot,"This book is pretty much about a man and his young son roaming through the aftermath of some apocalype -- not sure what it was beyond some flash of light. There were some things that happened along the way, but not much.If you are into adventurous types of books, this McCarthy work will probably leave you unsatisfied. If you are into sentimental books, then you'll like it a lot. By the number of stars I give it, you all surely know what type of books I read."
5,beautiful/heartbreaking,"This book had a funny effect on me. The first days I was reading it, on my way to work in the bus, I had to put it down as I felt tears in my eyes. Then it made me feel anxious but I could not stop, I had to read it until the end. And, wow, it is so beautiful in its own way, how this father loves this kid, And of course I just loved the kid too. And to end this I have to say that it made me feel more in love and be more patient with my own son. Worth reading."
1,....already taken,"McCarthy's limpest novel; worse, even, than All the Pretty Horses. I'd actually be relieved if it came out that some bizarre series of events led McCarthy to hire Orson Scott Card to ghost-write a story line he stole from Stephen King...A cautionary note to readers who attribute to The Road any sort of literary weight or force, and I realize there are many, reading anything before and, especially, including Blood Meridian, is to risk years of PTSD therapy..."
1,Vicious comments for objecting to the book,"Dark and depressing, but also suspenseful at times. Some of the dialogues were repetitive and the ending was disappointing. In any case I am wondering what the criteria for a Pulitzer price book is - regardless of it's category.When I finish a book I always like to go back to the different reviews at Amazon to see how other readers felt. To my big surprise I found some comments, that people were called names and put down after voicing their opinion that they disliked the book. One really must wonder what it takes to get into a ""war"", if people get that hostile over different beliefs regarding a book!"
1,Huh?,"I read this book based on the ""stunning"" reviews and found it to be the most tragic, unfulfilling experience. I dreamed the most horrifying dreams while reading it. Maybe I'm shallow, but I've been telling all my friends who read to ""run, don't walk, away from this sad, desperate work of fiction."" It is not poorly written, but even in the end, it left me feeling hopeless and sad."
1,"Unending, Tedious, Oppressive Nihilism","Cormac McCarthy in the Writer's Alamanac for July 20, 2008 is quoted as saying, ""There's no such thing as life without bloodshed. I think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous""I think HIS ideas and books are dangerous, depressive, and non-productive.The Road exemplifies his nihilistic viewpoint, and is a waste of precious reading time. Read ""Happier"" by Tal Ben-Shahar instead."
2,Overhyped Novel,"I bought it based on the overall good reviews it had around the Internet, but I finsihed it and feel utterly dissapointed, I read it quite fast since it has a very light narrative and attractive writing style (just to name one of the very few good things it had), the problem is that the core story is not interesting at all, there's barely any kind of depth or conflict, there is no back-story about the world, the characters and the dialog between them is very basic and almost insulting, there are some few moments when you think the story is starting to make sense and get some solidness but maybe the author wanted to play it safe because it quickly starts to get back to the boring and slow pacing mood that plagues almost all of its pages."
5,THE ROAD....Gripping and intense,"Not sure why there is no book name or cover.Oh my.....so intense, but so gripping you can't put it down.It was difficult to imagine having to live like that and be in fear of others as well as not having any food or water.What puzzled me was why they never did stay at a place they found was good and had some comforts.Makes you appreciate what we have and hope it won't be taken away."
1,The emperor has no clothes,"This novel was certainly intriguing, had a great sense of style accompanied with some very creative elements. What it lacked was any substance what-so-ever to warrant anything beyond a short story. Actually, it is a great short story, told over and over again about 20 times. And don't hold out for a powerful ending which will make the read worthwhile. You could rip all the pages out of this book, randomly order them, and read it again and it would be no different than the original. Every day is the same, told over and over again. Boy and man awake in an post-apocalyptic wasteland, push a cart along a road through the ash, come upon an abandoned farm house, get enough supplies to survive a few more days, then continue wandering. Occasionally they come upon someone who tries to kill them but they escape. Sometimes they eat peaches, other times okra. Sometimes it rains, sometimes it snows. Sometimes there's a comma, never there's a quotation mark."
5,Fascinating Read,"This was a book that I couldn't stop reading, even though it had so little action. I kept asking myself why I loved it so much. obviously it wasn't uplifting or exciting... but I couldn't stop reading. I think it was because I could so easily see myself in that guy's shoes. He was such a normal guy like me, dealing with a world with no clear direction of what to do. It was very powerful.Incidentally, I mentioned the book to my brother, who never reads. His wife almost killed me the next week. She said they'd planned to hang out over the weekend, but he planted his butt on the chair and read for two days strait. He loved it too."
5,Spellbinding,"I was wonderful. I recommend it. The whole time I was reading it I had an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach that something horrible was going to happen. I cried for the last 7 or 8 pages and for 20 minutes after I finished. There were no surprises, you could see it coming a mile away but it hit like a ton of bricks nonetheless."
1,Depressing With No Plot or Story,"I almost gave up on this book several times because the road never went anywhere but deeper into depression. This was a terrible book with almost no plot and no good ending. By good ending I mean a twist or revelation or something to make you go ""Wow, what a great ending!"". I'm sorry I wasted my time finishing this one."
2,Meh,I don't see what all the fuss is about? The poetic language is OK I guess if you like that kind of stuff... but there isn't much of a story or even much character development in this novel. Basically it reminded me of a high school reading assignment I had to force myself to finish reading.
1,I've been robbed!,"I bought the book on Oprah's recommendation - I was robbed! This was a waste of my valuable reading time.The dark and depressing storyline which trudged through its wasted landscape was interesting and compelling.UNTIL the ending. Much like mystery stories that introduce a crucial character on the last page, ""The Road,"" left me furious. Why not introduce the character on page one - and eliminate the need for the book altogether.Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy a contrived conclusion that negates the struggle of the entire book."
1,mccarthy's worst,"The Road is a stunningly terrible novel, McCarthy doing McCarthy badly, which is pretty bad. The novel is a slog through a wasted landscape of post-apocalyptic cliches which McCarthy tries to refresh with his tedious prose. This is where McCarthy's post-Hemingway machismo can only lead--the death of everything that we love, but mostly women and children. I was a fan of Blood Meridian for a while, but now McCarthy's writing, like Hemingway's, only depresses me. Give me Alice Munro, who can write rings around McCarthy."
2,The worst book I have read in a long time,"I am astonished at the reviews written here about this book. The is the worst written, and most uninteresting book that I have read in a very long time. And I do a lot of reading.The author doesn't use proper punctuation or grammar, which makes it difficult to follow at times. For example he never uses quotation marks when people are speaking, and he also doesn't separate dialog by paragraphs. So it difficult at times to know if the person is talking or thinking.It speaks very ill of the ""Pulitzer prize"" people that they hand this award out to such a poorly written book.I gave it two stars, because I don't actually hate it. It had promise, but never reached it's potential. I would say it is a horrible book, and I don't recommend it to anyone."
5,depressingly beautiful,"I watch the movie and it was sad but depressingly beautiful in the same way.The 6 disk audio CD of the book was my companion on the solo drive from San Jose to Yosemite and back. And I enjoyed the story even more, the audio CD was able to bring forth the feeling and compassion of the father to his son through the voice of the reader.Definitely recommend this book in whatever medium you can find."
1,A great book?!!,"This book received so many rave reviews I thought that it must be a great work of literature. It's not. It's a very simple one dimensional story with repetitive facile dialogs. ""I'm scared"" ""Don't be scared,"" ""Okay"" ""Okay"" over and over again. Crossing bridges, laying down tarps, wrapping his son in a blanket, over and over again. The father loves his son. Well, I should hope so. This story didn't show any deeper kind of love or devotion than almost any other novel..so I'm not sure what the point is."
3,Not Your Happily-Ever-After,"I'm not sure what to make of this book. It's good. Held my interest. Can be confusing as to who's speaking at times but nothing annoying.Something's happened to bring the world to its present condition. To bring the boy and his father to this place in their lives where they are on the lam. Hope is all they have. To lose this hope is to lose all purpose. And their purpose is to survive. And so on they go. The child has a love for others; His father does not. They know there are good guys and bad guys but who can tell which is which? It's a desperate, desolate world with everyone struggling to survive. If plundering is common, so is cannibalism. So they hide. So they plunder. So they..."
5,A book to be Re-read,"Many of us read for the joy of reading and just about any book will do. The Road turned out to be one of the few that I will reread, not for the joy of reading, but for the quality of the reading."
4,Are we there yet?,"Everything beautiful is ash. The only life left on earth are the people who have divided themselves into predator and prey. This book is very well written. I can understand why it won prizes. But it is relentlessly depressing. Not the usual uplifting Oprah fare. I'm listening to the audio version, perhaps some day I'll finish it. But right now the man and the boy are doing pretty well. They just left finding a cache of food. They are camping for the night. It's not raining. I look over at my iPod and see they are only half way through their journey through hell and I just don't want to know what awful thing is going to happen next. Better to leave them in a happy place for awhile longer."
4,"Walk this one, it's a good read.. every step, every page.","Not his best, as that isBlood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the WestI recommendSoothing Music for Stray Catsby Jayne Joso if you like McCarthy, Irving, Steinbeck...McCarthy is a great stylist... but this isn't his best work as I say, but certainly worth a read, he is after all, an incredible observer of the human condition, and gritty human relations."
5,Didn't want to read it - so glad I did.,"I was dreading reading this book. My husband read it a couple of years ago and enjoyed it but, for some reason I had it in my head that it wasn't for me. He encouraged me to read it but I just put it off, I had no intention of reading this book. But, this April it is my book club's read so, I felt like I had to read it. Well, I loved it.For me this book came down to the strength of love between father and son. I found the journey they went on rewarding to read and I found hope in the end. It truly is a beautiful, poetic, and moving book. I'm so happy I threw away my misconceptions and read this book."
3,did I get the 1st proof?,"Because It looks like something is wrong with it. The sentences are incomplete and there are no quotation marks. I just got started on it, and it might be a page turner if I didn't have to re-read to figure out what's going on.Grammer rules aren't just arbitrary, they exist because sentences are not understandable when they are broken. Some of the paragraphs have 2 people talking but they just run on like sentences. Maybe the characters are just thinking instead of talking, who can tell?Sentences have a certain structure so you can tell what is happening to who. I had to re-read some things because I couldn't tell what the single adjective in the 5 word jumble refered to.After reading some of the reviews I can see now that I didn't get a proof but the real copy. Is this author a professional writer?!?I'll bet it will be a good book after the editing and corrections."
3,I now I'm knit picking but . . .,"Okay, so it is wonderfully written and the story is compelling but I can't stand it when an author ignores basic science. As a reader, I find it insulting.Assuming that the action takes place on our Earth, how are these people even alive if there are no plants producing Oxygen? It has evidently been some time since the cataclysm that caused the destruction so what are they breathing?My other smaller issue of fact is that dead cedars will stand for 40 years with little diminution of their stability. There is no way that scene in the cedar forest could happen 7 or 8 years after the death of the trees.Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. There is no excuse for this from such a great writer who one would think had excellent editors as well."
2,Master of deception,"All along the book, you're waiting for something to happen. Suspens is at its climax all the time but in the end...well nothing. This couple just go from luck to luck, they should probably have played loto.All right, the bonds between a father and his child are very well described but apart from that, I found the book pretty empty. The reflexion the father has on his life, on what happens is not even that deep after all and they just are lucky on their trip, finding food just when they needed it the most. fortunate!Well in a word, the book could have been great and has some sparks of greatness but it is definitely missing a little something."
2,Don't waste your money,"If you want to be depressed and like to have nightmares of how the world could or would be after another world war go ahead and read this. Sorrythat I didn't get how ""great"" this book was."
5,Wonderful!,"I heard about this book through Oprahs book club.I was enthralled, as it was addicting, touching yet heartbreaking.It was wonderfully written and you will not be disappointed."
2,BORING!,I was so excited to read this book after all the rave reviews. I thought it would be profound and thought-provoking. It was so boring I could barely get through it and not at all profound.
2,Very Short.,"The print version of this novel is a stretch to fill out 287 pages. For an average book I read about 12 pages in 30 minutes. This novel took me a 2 hour layover in Newark to read the whole thing. The plot was interesting, but I expect more meat in a book advertised as a full length novel. It is similar to paying full price for a movie that lasts only 30 minutes. Check out at the library for a quick read or borrow a copy, don't waste any money on it."
4,Amazingly addictive...,"Hesitant when I first read (listened), I became immediately engrossed in this book, mostly because of the fact that, for 304 pages, the main character and his son are practically the only characters in the book, minus the small ""bit-part"" characters that pop up here and there. Cormac McCarthy has written what other authors only dream to write: the perfect post-apocalyptic novel. Bravo!NOTE: Do not read the book while depressed. It will only make things worse. Believe me..."
1,Depressing beyond belief!!,"This is easily the most depressing novel I have ever read. Please do not buy this book if you are at a low point in your life- it might just send you over the edge. There is not one ray of sunshine in the entire book; it is an endless series of disappointments and horror, all in a similar vein, so it becomes redundant and boring. Walk, starve, hide, walk, starve, hide. That's the entire book, in a nutshell."
1,What's the Fuss?,I don't understand the rave reviews of this book. I picked it as my read for my book club and was almost stoned to death by my peers who also thought this was the biggest downer in the history of mankind.
1,You want me to pay HOW much for the Kindle edition?,Forget it. I'm going to the used bookstore.I just won't pay more for an electronic version than for a paper version.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I kept with it hoping McCarthy would do something to make it worth my while. That never happened. I should have trusted my instinct to set it down half way through.
1,great for an insomniac,"This one will put you to sleep. A waste of 8 bucks. A composium of 1001 ways to describe desolation, a non-existent plot. Save your money."
2,Well written 5 stars - Totally bleak and depressing 1 star,"This story is beautifully written and there is definitely the loving relationship of father and son. Having said this, it is one of the most depressing and bleak books I have read in a very long time. I just don't really enjoy spending my free time immersed in such a dismal story. I honestly can't imagine the author spending so much time wrapped up in this to write the story... I would need intense therapy if it were me."
3,Vivid images,"When asked, I wasn't sure how to describe how I felt about the book, other than saying...well, it kept me reading! The writing often seemed very simple and clear and brilliantly descriptive. And having survived a major hurricane down here on the Gulf Coast a couple of years ago brought the whole theme so much closer to feeling real. The ending seemed rather abrupt, and a little too neatly tied up, but I was compelled enough by Mr McCarthy to seek out another of his books. I'm now reading ""No Country for Old Men""."
3,Post-apocalyptic scrambled eggs?,"Riddled with implausibility and grammatical errors (even outside of its informal style), The Road leaves much to be desired. Though it's laden with ample suspense, the book ultimately fails to explain itself; trivial flashbacks serve as cheap teasers to the origin of an apocalypse that is never revealed. The end seems contrived, as does the Christ-like figure embodied by ""the boy."" Worth the read if you're not craving too much enlightenment. I'm hoping that the movie fleshes out a fuller, more consequential story."
1,"A Lonely, Depressing, Road","Cormac McCarthy has succeeded brilliantly, in depressing the hell out of me. The Road is a magnificent book, and that's the problem, I couldn't just ignore it, I couldn't disregard it, I had to feel the weight of the (dying) world on my shoulders. This book could literally give you nightmares. Compelling? Powerful? Yes, but I'm guessing being beaten over the head by a baseball bat is also compelling and powerful.Save yourself some joy in life, and don't read this book unless you want to feel miserable."
2,There goes several hours I'll never get back,"This book went nowhere and as far as a study of love's dedication....fail. Felt like I'd been strung along, waiting for some sort of explanation or resolution and then he wraps up the ending in a few paragraphs? And I'm all for word usage but many of the descriptive words used weren't even in the dictionary and seemed to be there just for obscurity's sake. I can't believe the high ratings this book got. The one thing this book did successfully was create a gloomy, desolate, hopeless atmosphere with the way the dialogue was handled and of course, the lurid gruesome details of cannibalism, but very glad this was a library read and not a purchase for me."
4,The Road--Religion and Detail,"The Road is both an emotional and suspenseful ride that follows a father and son through a post-apocalyptic world. A main theme throughout the novel is the role of religion and though I am not a religous fanatic, after reading McCarthy's novel I see the necessity of faith during the darkest hours of one's life. The father and son live for each other but also live for the hope of a better day. The ending is heart wrenching. The book contains so much detail that every line is important."
1,Useless Tome,"This book has almost no value (aside from a door stop). The information is incomplete, even for the time it was written. I applaud the effort of running scripts to ferret out ""undocumented"" information but even that information is presented in a useless fashion. Skip this book even when it is stacked high on the remainder pile."
2,Should be called cheese sauce with a little macorani.,"Very disappointed. More sauce than pasta! The flavor is ok, but not the best. The boxed mac & cheese with the cheese sauce(not powdered) is far better."
4,Excellent,"The book was in great shape, it was close enough to the main idea of the movie, and yet not too long. My son loves the movie and really loves having this book now too."
5,MOUTHING OFF Is The Greatest Mind Candy Of All Time,"!Wow. I love this book. Nice job, John David.I keep reading this book from front to back. I then start over from the beginning again. It's like I can't retain what I am reading....But I keep reading it....so...it must be a great book.Right?"
2,Too Slow,Very slow sled. Ridged bottom acts as a brake on snow. Not designed for adult sled enthusiasts.
2,Poor Quality Sled,"The sled was fast and comfortable, but it had a hole in it after one day of sledding and hasn't been used since. Bummer."
5,Best low cost amp around,I purchased this amp for my tv in the living room. I don't have surround sound in that room so I was looking for an amp that had very good stereo and the potential for surrond sound if I so desire in the futre. The amp is a good fit for that. The clarity of sound and ease of use are perfect for my wife and family to use. My media room also has an ONKYO amp but is a much higher powered system since that one is used for surround sound. All in all a the TX-SR303s is a great amp and the low price is the bonus.
4,"A pain to install, but other than that it's Great!","While installing this on Windows XP, it said XP was not a supported system and that it may still work properly. Once installed it gave me an error message that said the audio was disconnected or not working properly. I went to [...]. and downloaded the first fix. It works wonderfully now! It was a pain, but I hope this helps others who may have the same problem. BTW, the disc and the box it came in both say clearly that it works with XP. Best Wishes!!"
4,GREAT for homeschooling!,"Sometimes getting the science enrichment my children need while homeschooling can be a challenge. I've found it difficult, at times, to keep them excited all the time. Science IS fun and thanks to this CD ROM my children now LOVE science, too! For anyone who bought this CD ROM and is having trouble running it, we had the same issue. Do a google search for the ""I Love Science and I Love Math patch"" and after downloading it you should be able to play it with no problems. It's tons of fun for everyone! It's a great break from the worksheets. Interactive science fun and facts- you can't beat that! There are so many dimensions to this CD ROM. Just pop it in and let your child explore the world of science!"
2,perfect till it broke,"The size and shape of this are just right; but the pin slipped out/broke from a hinge on the handle after less than 10 uses. Unusable now, and wondering if it's worth trying again."
3,eh...,"Pretty average... my expectations were low when I ordered this item, plus I was on a tight budget. Upon delivery I was definitely underwhelmed. I almost sent it back. After a few months of careful use, it is still holding up, but I expect it will not last a year. At least it wasn't expensive."
3,Hard to use when charging,"As a car charger, this product works well. Seems to charge the phone farily quick, no problems there. The problem comes in when you try to use the phone while it is being charged. This cord is so short and so tight that unless you lean in towards the charger you won't be able to use it. I cannot sit comfortably in my drivers seat and use my phone with the charger plugged in. I think they need to increase the length of the cord about 12 inches or so to make it work better."
4,Intensity and Clarity,"This little package packs a powerful emotional punch. His stories are brilliant. Raymond Carver became known in America for minimalism, but Tomas Rivera overpowers him. Brief, and brilliant, and poetic in a way so beautiful...'The Salamanders' will never leave you."
1,Broken in Just a Few Weeks,"My daughter loved this toy, but it broke in just a few weeks. We changed the battery, tried different brands of batteries, and it still will not work. She is crushed. I called the number on the back and they said I have to send the piano with a note and they will send a replacement in 4-6 weeks. I don't even want another one - it is an absolute piece of junk. Also - way too many Christmas Carols. They couldn't find any other songs to include?"
1,Disappointed!,"Let me just start by saying that I have been a Roddy Frame fan since the release of his first CD back in 1983, ""High land, Hard rain."" It was a new sound, it was fresh and I just loved Roddy Frame's playful guitar work. The sound and feeling of the music was almost electric and the excitement in his voice was as if he had something to shout about. Ever since then I have collected every Aztec Camera album, single, extended version, b-side and collectible available. However I am completely disappointed with, ""Surf."" It just doesn't sound like he has anything to shout about anymore. He sounds uninspired and almost bored at times. If you are a fan of Roddy Frame you should definitely do yourself a favor and get a copy of Aztec Camera's greatest hits instead. You'll be happy you did!"
5,Saves my dog and my money,"My dog was diagnosed with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency about a year and a half ago. That means that his pancreas does not produce enzymes to digest his food anymore. That makes for a VERY sick dog if he can't digest his food (diarrhea, etc. etc.)!!! The doc prescribed him Pancreazyme which was going to cost me around $100 a month I believe. Well, we couldn't afford that so I did a ton of research and found this alternative. I sprinkle it on his food every time and he's good to go. This stuff cost about 1/12 of the price of the prescription stuff!!!"
5,"Excellent product, eliminates gas","We have a greyhound with gas that can clear out a room. We purchased this product after reading the reviews on Amazon and trying a probiotic from a local store that did nothing. Prozyme has done wonders for our dog and has made our lives infinitely more pleasant. It reduced his gas significantly and the smell is no longer overwhelming, and often we don't notice at all. It has also helped him gain weight; he was a bit underweight after adopting him from the local rescue. Overall he is healthy and happy now and we are extremely pleased with the results. Highly recommended product."
2,prozyme454,i have tried it and it doesn't work my dogs breath is still bad well at least i didn't lose a lot of money on this product
1,pointless..do not buy,"This video is nothing more than two guys from New Jersey talking about wine from... New Jersey!? No information about what so ever. No wonder amazon did not allow a preview of this garbage. Let my wasting of money not be vein, stay away from this please..."
1,Wrong wrenches three times and it's stripping my nuts,I ordered a METRIC wrench set and received a SAE fractional set three times. Customer service was notified 3 times that the part number was wrong. In the meantime the price increased $20.00. Why cant I get a METRIC Reversible Ratcheting Wrench Set?Stanley 85-998 7 Piece Metric Reverse Ratcheting Wrench Set
1,Misleading,"This book was very disturbing. On the surface it seemed as if it was a Christian oriented book, but underneath a very thin facade it potrayed Christians as ineffectual, confused weaklings.It seemed to be more concerned with an exhaustive amount of detail on out of body experiencies, ""the dark master"", and the concept that we are all ""gods""."
4,"The Starting Line ""With Hopes Of Starting Over""","""Leaving"" 5/5""Saddest Girl Story"" 5/5""Three's A Charm"" 5/5""Greg's Last Day"" 4/5""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now"" 5/5""With Hopes Of Staring Over,"" is the debut release from The Starting Line. This solidified the fact that they were going to be somebody's in the future. A must have for any pop-punk fan.Overall rating: Four and a half stars."
5,Holy cow Emerson is awesome,"I'm a little confused by the format of this book as there is no copyright or publishing information. It must have come in a package of other essays, but his writings are amazing. It's like every sentence is a deep quotable thought induced by a drunken night of intrapersonal exploration."
4,"Cool Jazz, and Funk Trappings = French House Fun!","The laid back BPM of Acid Jazz is usually a big snoozer for me - and much the current French house tends to wear with attitude. However this I certainly did not mind. Any composer that can borrow Billie Holiday's vocals to create a haunting musical soundscape amid an urban hip-hop beat is taking risks that such genre DJ's simply won't. If you buy this, you certainly won't be disappointed."
4,Adventure and Stuff.,"A NIGHT IN TERROR TOWER may not be one of R.L. Stine's creepiest books, but it is one of the better action/adventure stories I've read in the Goosebumps series. The story starts out like the typical Goosebumps spookfest with a couple of kids getting lost in the Terror Tower in London and being chased by a sinister looking man who wears black. However, the story soon evolves into something like a fantasy adventure. I loved this story. However, because of a few plot holes at the end, I only gave it four stars instead of five. Other than that, it's a great book that's a little bit different than the average Goosebumps tales."
3,Need to list ingredients.,"It would be helpful for you to list the ingredients of each product. After I received it, I found out it was missing one ingredient that I needed for my dog."
2,Trumpet fell off,I got these for my son for christmas and we installed them about a mounth ago. They worked good but he made a trip to CT from ME and on the way home the large trumpet fell off. He called the company in NY and they told him it would cost $58.00 for a new one.
4,Provides a good understanding of the game,"Although the book can be a little preachy, John Patrick takes you thoroughly through every aspect of the game. If you want to get serious about craps, this is the book to read. Not for aggressive gamblers who want to hit it big overnight."
3,Not very convincing,"Althoug the book covers a large quantity of chess pawn structures, they are not covered in depth. They are just exemplified. So it is a book only helpful for beginners or chess instruction, but nothing more."
2,Worth $10 to $15,"Just received this fan. If I were to see it first hand, I would have never purchased it. I could kick myself a hundred times over for paying $38 for this. It is very cheaply made, pretty much flimsy. On high it doesn't even compare with my nicer fans low speed, barely cooling you off. If you decide to purchase it, make sure you spend no more than $10 to 15 total and not a penny more."
5,"Sturdy, simple","I just purchased my second of this product, having used the first for over a year. My favorite features:-Durable - very sturdy plastic, I never need to worry about tossing it around-Customizable - plenty of different configurations possible, and easy to change around-Scalloped trays - this might seem small, but having rounded bottoms on each compartment makes scooping small parts a breeze-Solid latch - the big, wide latch has never come undone whether upside down, right side up, etc.For the price, you'd be silly not to get one."
4,Retail Therapy!,I could definitely relate to this book! Mma Makutsi's retail therapy/shoe obsession is not unlike my own. Very entertaining and descriptive writing. A.M.S. makes you feel as if you're in the thick of it. Seller was easy to work with; would buy from them again.
5,No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,"This entire set of books was a delight to read. They showed that people are the same, regardless of ethnicity or culture. During the course of reading these books, I learned a great deal about Botswana and its culture, history and people. The books were well written, interesting, and easy reading. Once I got started, I read the entire set in a few days. I can hardly wait for the movie to be released. I would certainly recommend the entire set to anyone wanting to learn about people in general, Botswana in particular, and African culture."
5,Consistently enjoyable,"A delightful, fun read in the same vein as its predecessors. I like the lead character's outlook on life and common sense approach. The glimpse into Botswana culture is enjoyable as well. Can you get happiness from a pair of blue shoes? Sure."
4,Orson Welles as King Saul,"Orson Welles is at his brooding best as Saul, Israel's first king. Trouble starts when his army has to face a Philistine army championed by a nine-foot-tall warrior named Goliath.David is in Saul's camp to locate his brothers when he hears the big bopper's challenges and he volunteers to fight him.All it takes to bring the giant down is one well-placed rock and David is a big hero. Jealous, Saul wants to get rid of him now."
4,Excellent Russian Review,"I can recommend this workbook for those interested in studying Russian. Nachalo is an excellent ""beginning"" for students. And this workbook serves as a good companion to the textbook."
4,One of my favorites,"Whitehorse is the hot and steamy story about childhood lovers who were torn apart by family. They meet again as adults and though the road to reconcilliation is not easy, they are now old enough to know that love is worth all the pain."
5,Great CD for Your Collection,"This live album is a gem. Recorded at New York's Cutting Room, the audience is treated to a live and vibrant Kate Taylor performance in the comfort of their own home. This is a must-have to round out your musical collection."
3,It's an Okay Workout,"I've done other Pilates DVD and this one is challenging but it's also very easy to strain your neck with it. It moves to quickly and she doesn't provide enough time to relax the neck muscles. For the ab portion of the DVD, you're basically holding your head up (giving a good chance of neck strain) for almost the full 20 minutes. At least it felt that way."
1,earth 2160,Dude this game is a bit of a dud. If you want a great game go with some of the older versions but I highly recomend the inspration of these games which is warzone 2100.
5,softwalk women's Morgan,This is the 3rd pair of Softwalks that I have had. I am on my feet for long periods of time and the insoles of these shoes are a great help. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone.
2,Don't bother to purchase this one........,Track 5 is my only favorite song on this CD but the whole CD sounds as if someone recorded from scratchy LP's being played with a worn out stylus or stereo needle. I wouldn't recommend this one at all.
3,I prefer 60 over 90 Minute Tapes,If you are going to be recording audiocassettes with normal bias tape I recommend using Maxell 60-Minute Tape over the Maxell 90-Minute variety. The Maxell 90-Minute tapes are made utilizing thinner mil (thickness) tape that is likely to jam in many audiocassette recorders and/or players. I rarely have this problem with Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes. I really stay away from these Maxell 90-Minute Normal Bias tapes unless I need something in a pinch.
3,This item is for a small dog,"In the product description, it mentions the sizes offered. At time of checkout, it is not asked which size is desired. When I received the product, it was clearly a small one. It is well made, etc. but was not suitable for my dogs due to the small size."
3,Late to the field,"Gulag Archipelago is the best work in this area, the lateness of this book in comparison to the published works sort of made think is this true?.Breezy American writing style, but short on much of the horrors of the starvation diseases that where suffered by many just become names, was this an editorial decision?. From a Feldsher (a position of comparative luxury) in the camp system. If true then this is a frank account, and the foolish things that belief does to people who should know better (protecting relatives until then?).The jump from 1950 to 199x is disconcerting Read Gulag first, a supplementary work."
3,Not the best but it's not bad,Recently bought these and did have the problem of them falling out of my ears but that was quickly remedied by putting a set of the cushions on them from my iPod earbuds. They haven't fallen out since. The sound quality is great and they work perfectly. There is a jack you can buy so that you can use regular headphones instead but I like these because you can take a call without swapping out or battling with the cord. Overall it's a good product if you can't afford a $100 bluetooth headset.
2,One size doesn't fit all,"I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear... I figured at this price, I'd try for my wife and I. When I first tried them on, I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on. Even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them. Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones. Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive."
4,Overall a good GPS unit,"I purchased this on an Amazon sale for about 1/2 price and must say it was the best value for the money at the time. I've own it now for about a year and have been very happy for a 2nd generate device.Pros-easy to create routes by several methods.-very accurate-icon that lets you know what lane to be in ahead of time.-easily toggle between speed, time and distance to go.-quick satellite acquisition.Cons-maps no longer updateable (not a big deal for trips, but trying to find a house in a new neighborhood would be a problem)-the button lights (blue) are very bright at night when you press them-very accurate-in that if a 2 lane is widened to a 4 lane it shows you are not on track.-battery doesn't last longConclusion- if you can find one at a reasonable price it is a good choice. With the 3rd generation GPS units less than $200 it wouldn't make sense to pay too much for this one."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is not what is pictures. I'm not even completely sure it's a little golden book. It does say Golden book on the front but doesn't look like the other Little Golden books that I have in my library. With that said, it's still a good story and we'll keep it and read it. But beware it's not as it appears."
1,Great if it works....software issues plague the thing-update,"The iron is excellent when it works, what can I say. The second one, which was a warranty replacement, just broke showing an ""err"" message and no heat, same as the last one. The first one made it perhaps three months, this one did not fare so well, failed at just about a month old. Going back to the Black and Decker store again, this time hopefully for a refund.Update- Returned this model without a problem, something B and D is good about. New iron is in the closet as a spare since I had already purchased another brand (which has functioned flawlessly for months). Still recommend staying away from this iron."
5,All wrapped into one package!,The best buy for the $$. I can't keep enough of the BBQ sauce and Jerk Mustard in the house. Family and friends love it. The blackened season is great on fish or to spice up a salad.
5,jmjm1028@hotmail.com,"Beautifully chilled music, put together with taste. This album will rise and I'll make sure people know about it....."
4,"Cheap cables, but do the job","These cables work, they're cheap, and they sound fine. You can get a 6-pack of pedal cables for the standard price of a single ""budget"" pedal cable. As such, these seem good for musicians just playing for fun at home. My ear can't tell the difference between these and more expensive ""budget"" cables.These cables definitely feel cheap, with very thin cables between the nickle plated jacks. However, given the short distance between pedals, I haven't noticed a change in sound compared to thicker cables. Because of how thin these cables are, they are good for practice at home, but I'd want something more reliable for gigging.If you play an expensive guitar through an expensive amp, or require reliability for gigs, you may want an expensive cable to complete the package. For those playing cheap guitars through cheap amps, or just fooling around and having fun at home or with friends, these cables do the job for 1/6 the price of the closest competition."
2,Crap cables.,"Out of the pack half the cables were noisy and did not work.Save your money and by some metal end cables.These suck.A waste of time and money.Seriously,don't buy 'em."
5,Solid,Not much to say - these are solid little connectors. No need to spend more. These work just fine. Try some.
4,The price is right!,"You can't repair these yourself, so if doing so is important you might want to go for the Fender ones, but these are the lowest price on the market and they're decent quality. Suitable for any non-professional or semi-professional setting."
3,Pedal jumpers,I got these because I work as a live sound engineer and they sometimes come in handy used as interconnects between guitar pedals.
3,review From Toads to Queens : Transvestism in a Latin Americ,From Toads to Queens gave a unique understanding of life of a transvestite in South America and how unique those individuals are thought to be and the relationship with the transvestites and the members of the community
4,Further adventures of the Vatta's family and Rafe,"This is a sequel in the Vatta's War series. This was a good read with reasonable pace. Character development for Rafe, Stella and other minor characters. This is the best book since the first book in the series. I am returning to this series after hearing a reading of the first book in the series, Trading in Danger."
4,Top Secret Rosies,"What a wonderful and long-overdue tribute to these incredibly important women of winning WWII!The DVD suffers from careless editing, however. Discussing the Norden bombsight as important for hitting German tagets with the B-17, a B-29 mission over Japan was the visual in the background. And yes, it IS an important distinction, especially in a history of this type. And it is not J. Robert OH-penheimer, but J. Robert OPP-inheimer. I have met him at Berkeley and have never heard his name pronunced in this way. Nitpicking? Perhaps just a little. But the memory of these women deserves better editing than these glaring errors."
4,My daughter loves it.,My daughter is almost 3 and she loves this set. Its easy on and easy off and lots of fun!
4,Durable and easy to use for kids,"My daughter (7) loves art, and she really enjoys this set. It's easy for her to use, and adds lots of fun sparkle to her art projects. I was pleased to find that the ink wasn't too difficult to remove from her hands!"
5,"Rusalkas, Demons, and Firebirds, Oh My!","I really enjoyed _Firebird_ by Mercedes Lackey. The use of Russian mythology is wonderful and adds a taste of richness to the story. Everything in the book is magical and fairy-tale-like without being too sugary-sweet.If you are looking for a light read with adventure, romance, and fun, read this book!"
3,too much jazz,"This bokk was lackey's interpritation of a classic fairy tale mixexd in with trademark trystings,fanciful creatures, and flourishes. in my opinion, fairy tales are best left to themselves. The main character reminded me gratly of Hearld-Mage Vanyel, complete with bellowing father, dim-witted brothers,and simpering mother. Also because he was always getting beat up on.The only difference in the character is that one was gay and the other fought with his hands."
1,SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN.,"i wanted this carrier for so long, and when I got it I didn't have to wait to long to see how painful is on my shoulders, the pad and the shoulder strap keep twisting all the time even when is already on; and for some reason the weight doesn't goes to your hip, a try it for a month , I try it tight and loose..and always is your shoulder and neck the ones that suffer...A terrible bad product. Finally I made myself the ""MAYA SLING"", it work perfect ! nothing bulky, easy to wear and to carry, no straps, 100% padded,I used with both of my babies 13 months and 30 month. It is very comfortable and simply. sometimes tecnology doesn't do better than simple and old fashioned... The hip hammock stay somewhere in a box..."
5,"""EXTREME""","This book is simply incredible. For a 21 year old mind to have so much insight, is simply remarkable. Anyone who is even considering an alternate future must read this book. Michael explores the different ways to achieve success by taking the road less traveled. He backs up his information with credible sources, exquisite detail, and a vast pool of personal accomplishments. This book will change lives, and is in line to be a best seller."
3,Multizone?,"I just like to know if i'll be able to see region 4 and 2 discs with this unit, or it just works with zone 1 encoded discs.Regards"
3,A Cancer Cure Gone Bad,"The hook: a young man, a genius, racing across the country to save his girlfriend from cancer. The problem: his cure has gone bad and he is now a carrier. A mere touch from him causes the flesh of people to dissolve in seconds. Hard to believe, but then the effects of HIV and Ebola were probably hard to believe a few years ago. The author maintains the suspense throughout the story and makes the unbelievable at least interesting if not believable. A fast paced read, good for a few hours of entertainment."
3,Not adequate in representation,Kim is a way better singer live. The album cover also does not reveal her amazing good looks. This as a whole does not represent the singer that I have seen and heard live. I'm just being honest she is soooo much better than this.
5,Found these gems at a 2nd hand store for $15.......,.......and man I am ever glad I picked them up!!These are now discontinued.Athena was bought out by Klipsch to eliminate the competition.They have a lovely sound for most all music I listen to and are very good for loud rock when matched to a small subwoofer.If you can find them 2nd hand somewhere I would definitely say pick them up because they are great for the price.My B&W; speakers aren;t much better than these little gems.Cheers and good listening!
4,excellent simple map,"I bought this as a reference while looking for land on the big island, and for this purpose it is perfect. Its small enough that you unfold the whole map in your lap, while in the drivers seat of your car. This way you can see the whole island at once, yet it seems to have every town and subdivision clearly listed."
2,I need my money back becouse is take longer to send book I wanted,is took longer time to send book I want so I need my money back soon impossibbe also you better give my refound to ather book.
4,Great buy,"I shopped all over the internet and read all kinds of reviews, this stroller was a great buy for me and my family. My soon to be 3 y/o loves riding in the stroller. He has good leg room, considering he is 39"" tall. He loves looking at his new (1mth old) baby brother in the reverse Graco carrier in front. Don't buy this stroller for storage underneath, there isn't any, that's where my older son's legs are. I love this stroller for the price, easy to assemble directions, versatility w/ stand option, & easy maneuvering. My 2 neighbors test drove this with my kids on board and plan to purchase this same stroller. I bought this stroller for shopping trips, nights out down the shore, and short neighborhood walks. I would definitely recommend this product. As always great shopping w/ amazon and free shipping!"
4,Same as Sit n Stand Elite Double Stroller from One Step Ahead,"I was wondering the same thing about this stroller - i.e. how does it convert to ""stand"" mode? etc. I had seen the version of this stroller on the One Step Ahead website, so I called Baby Trend and they told me it is the exact same stroller. It is just marketed differently for the different vendors... and they are different colors. So, you can go to the One Step Ahead website to get more views of the stroller. I still have not purchased it yet, worried about the quality and the overall length of the stroller. But it does seem to be one of the lightest double strollers available. Good Luck!"
3,item is better for infant and toddler,i bought this item for my one and two year old and it is a ok stroller however the front seat is not very comfortable for a toddler. when i had my friends baby in front in the carseat the ride was fine
2,Not For Bose Wave Radio,"I picked up a pack of these CD-r's at a nearby Walgreens like another reviewer did. Unfortunately they, for some reason, will not play on my Bose Wave Radio/CD player. They play on both my computers, my component stereo in the living room and in my car. So if you want to burn music to play on Bose equipment I would suggest looking at another brand. TDK, Sony, Immation, Memorex,Verbatim, etc. all work fine. Since the Wave Radio is what I use most, I won't be buying these anymore."
4,Hilarious tales of travel mishaps,"Great humor infuses these widely different but generally very enjoyable tales of travel travail.Right from the start, the introduction sets the mood with one tiny vignette: how did one person deal with a public toilet in the Amsterdam library? It's a side-splitting tale that succeeds brilliantly when read aloud.There are many wonderful tidbits in this collection (by some acclaimed writers), a few odd losers, but on balance this is a great book to infuse a little humor into the ever-unpredictable realm of travel.Absolutely first rate as a travel companion. I laughed aloud often."
4,A worthwhile read,"Enjoyable, and well worth the purchase price. ... this book has some stories that aren't worthreading, but about 80% of the book was truly enjoyable. This bookhas introduced me to a number of authors that I have never heardof before, and whose other works I will certainly seek out."
2,purile (.adolescent ) humor that provokes no belly laughter,"I was extremely disappointed in this book which I expected to be humorous. The title is- but so far I have found nothing worth a guffaw! It is extremely adolescent genital humor. Many known humorists are given a one liner at the end of uinknown writers ""hilarious accounts"". I could do better myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The history of Santa Fe's rebuilding of their F7s.,"The Santa Fe super chief passenger trains of the 40's,50's and 60's were top of the line trains in their day. But nothing stirs more emotions then the thought of that train racing past you, on its trip from Chicago to LA, at 100 mph, with two Santa Fe EMD F7 warbonnets at its point. But with passenger trains in their heyday the Santa Fe railroad needed to focus their attention to freight. Unfortunally, what made for an excellant passenger engine, made for a lousy road switcher. This book chronicles the production model CF7 rebuilds from F7 locomotives at the Cleburne, Texas shops. If you ever wondered how they turned those engines inside out, this books for you. The collection of B&W and Color photography of this locomotive, along with the different color schemes that have adorned the outside of the engines, as they were passed on to different shortline companies is superb. Any who are fans of this locomotive should have this in their libary."
3,Room for improvement,"I'll start out with what I feel are the ""cons"" of this product since that is what makes up the majority of my review anyway. As mentioned by other reviewers, the bar clamps leave a lot to be desired and left me wondering what kind of bar these clamps WOULD work on. I had to adapt the clamps using some thin PVC tubing. I found the bars to be too short for a comfortable ride even with my short forearms and found myself constantly cranking my wrists around the bars to keep my forearms from cramping up. One positive is the weight. Looking back, I'm sure there are better bars out there that cost less, weigh more but are more comfortable."
1,Quality material ... but won't fit...,"I really wanted to like these bars. I liked the shape & feel of the bars. But as others have stated, I just couldn't tighten them enough to get a firm fit.When paying as much as I did, I shouldn't have to run to the hardware store to jury rig some adjustment to get a proper fit.Avoid them. I should have paid attention to the review of others here ...There are being shipped back tomorrow!"
5,A wake up call,"""The Little one Diaries"" came across my path when I needed it the most. Having access to this information reminded me that I was loved and supported. It woke me to the fact that I did not need to struggle through every day feeling like the weight of the world was upon my shoulders.A beautiful and inspiring piece of work. Rich enough to read over and over again."
2,Nice but what is up with the velcro,"It has a nice look, the materials are not bad, and lots of pockets. The problem that I have with this bag is the amount of Velcro inside. It is very difficult to customize the positioning of the padding, but I guess if one is going to use only one configuration then it is not a big deal. Secondly, the Velcro strips have sharp edges which will scratch your camera every time you put it in or pull it out. My intention was to use this bag with a Rebel T1i, and the size of the bag is about right. The bag is capable of holding the camera with a lens attached (e.g. 18-55mm), an additional lens (e.g. 70-200mm), a flash, and other small items (e.g. memory cards, additional batteries, etc). However, because of the Velcro issue, this camera is being returned as I write this review. A good bag is supposed to protect the camera, not scratch it."
3,"Good, not great...","As other reviewers note the bag is a tad on the small side. My Nikon D40 -- a small-ish camera by DSLR standards -- and it just barely fit inside the bag. You can shoehorn in extra lenses but it makes for a very tight fit. On the plus side, the bag is slim and easy to carry, and it doesn't look like a camera bag (which I suppose could help thwart theft). It actually looks like a lunch bag, which along with the odd color (which I was iffy about in the first place), just didn't work for me. I ended up returning it.... but this bag will definitely work for you if you don't need a ton of room and like the non-camera-bag-looking aspect."
4,Great Bag,"SLR camera bags are bulky and heavy. I purchased this bag to have a smaller bag for my new camera. This bag is not only smaller, but quite compact. The top design allows for easy access to my camera quickly and easily when I need it most. There are several pockets for storing accessories and other needed supplies. The bag has a top handle as well as shoulder strap.The cell phone holder and inside pocket are a big snug when camera is packet in bag, but the top zip compartment is roomy for small items. This is a great back for traveling or tooling around town with your camera."
4,Good bag but too small for my equipment,"I have a D80 with 18-135 mm, 50mm and also 70-300 mm lens. The bag looks so good but it's just too small for my equipment. This bag can hold 2 small lens and 1 battery charger and that's it. I rated it 4. I love the design. I'm selling it and buying a bigger camera bag."
2,Not worth it's low price,"It's inexpensive and not even worth the price. It is entirely too small for a T2i and 75-300mm lens, it is such a tight squeeze, I'm afraid it'll mess up my fisheye lense. In the drawn dimensions it shows it has room for the camera with a mounted lens and and another lens with a filter and a flash or light meter but that drawing is just a drawing. Invest in something better, seriously."
4,Pretty good,"The bag is handsome, well-made, and easy to carry. I like the grab handle. I have a Nikon D-80 and with one additional zoom lens the bag is tight enough to pull then lens cap off as I extricate the camera from the bag. I have removed much of the adjustable Velcro padding from inside the bag and it it still just a tad too tight. Overall I think the bag is a value and as time goes by I think it will loosen up."
4,Pure sci-fi fun and entertainment.,"This movie is good, simple to follow and adventurous. It has in it time travel, aliens, robots, spaceships, humor and action. It does look cheesy but that is another good thing in this movie, don't ask me why. Overall: VERY GOOD."
5,This is a FABULOUS book.,"Louie Anderson does a fantastic job of detailing the life of children growing up with alcololic parents. I have never read a more moving book, and cried in several places because of how great he painted the picture of life in his home. Everyone should read this book!!"
1,Please Kelly Brownell GROW UP!,"What a pile of garbage. This book is looking for an excuse. ""Its not my fault I'm overweight. I'm overweight because of ..... (fill in the blank)""Lets look for someone to blame and not address the real issues. Oh wait, lets file a class action lawsuit against the food places we eat after all McDonalds is forcing us to eat there. Maybe Kelly Brownwell should just say no (to a cheeseburger)!Here is an issue that the AMA will not address. Diabetes is related to insulin/sugar. The AMA is pushing a high carbohydrate diet. Carbohydrates are sugars! The AMA solution is to eat smaller portions. Who wants to be hungry? Where did the AMA come up with this portion size thing? The allotted portion for snack chips is three. With a protein diet one can eat a steak and not feel hungry afterwards."
5,An excellent introduction to the care of guinea pigs!,"I bought this book for my daughter just before we got her first pets, two guinea pigs! The pictures are lovely and the book covers guinea pig likes and dislikes, as well as their basic needs from vitamin c to clean water. The best part though is the author's continued assertation that guinea pigs love to be cuddled!"
4,A lovely introduction to Guinea Pigs,"This is a sweet book with factual and anecdotal info re: guinea pigs. Our family especially loved the illustrations by Anita Jeram. We found this book an effective introduction to what guinea pigs are like, what they need (at a very basic level), and how they can enhance a family not quite ready for a larger pet (and not interested in hamsters/gerbils/mice/rats/birds/fish)."
4,Dive Watch,Excellent dive watch. Comfortable and useful. However the indiglo isnt very bright and only lights up the numbers. Overall a great watch and I highly recommend it
3,"Functional, but no wow factor","It does what I ordered it for and I have no complaints, but I am not sure it is necessarily better than less expensive watches in the same sports genre."
2,"Nice looking on line, but too big","I ordered the watch on line, and since there were no dimensions listed, or alternate views of the product, I was not able to tell how ridiculously thick the watch face really is. It's a nice looking watch, too bad it is so clunky and weird looking. I had to return it and try another model. I did try the indiglo button when I first got it, and the illumination was very weak. Nothing like other Timex watches I've owned in the past. Very disappointed in it."
1,Stopped working,I bought the Timex Men's T5F821 Ironman 30-Lap Shock Resistant Watch for someone and after a couple months it stopped working. Not what I would expect from the timex brand looked like a cheap watch when I received it.
3,Worthy of an Emperor. . .almost. . .,Very helpful and easy to read. The CD-ROM has many helpful utilites and ideas. There are some drawbacks: No Index made searching for topics difficult. The AI section could have explained the different actions and conditions in sighlty more detail. Color pictures would have been nice.

2,Not great,I believe the time period this was produced in detracted from the beautiful dialog I enjoy when watching Shakespeare. The acting was very good but not enough to save this production.
4,Great Performances: Macbeth,"I really liked this adaptation of the famous play Macbeth. I think it is one of the better Macbeth DVDs because it has remained true to the original context of the play, by keeping the same dialogue. And also it has improved, with the help of this version's new look, a type of underworld, modern vibe,the play is not so much as old fashioned as previous Macbeth DVD adaptations,with the old ideas of what witches and castles should look like. Because of this new way of portraying the characters in the play, this is what grabbed my attention at first, and it helped to keep me on my toes. The movie is 3 hours long, but it is worth it, I would reccommend this dvd to anyone who has read the original play, Macbeth by William Shakespeare, and liked it a lot, and anyone who happens to like fantasy/horror plays."
4,Very unique and entertaining,"I used this version for my 12th grade English class and it was just wonderful. Patrick Stewart was fantastic. All of the scenes with the witches were very engaging and this was probably the best banquet scene I've ever seen. I would have given it five stars, but I was quite disappointed with the portrayal of Lady Macbeth."
3,A great disappointment,"When I bought this book I thought that it was going to be great. But, I actually judged it by the cover, since it looked really great. Actually, with all due respect I think that this course is not worth it. There are a lot of mistakes, on the book and on the cassettes, it doesn't help you a lot, it's too overwhelming and it's absolutely not for beginners. Me, I've been learning French for six years now, and I've tried a lot of courses and so far this is the worst I have ever used. It's too hard, and you feel completely lost after a while. If you're learning French, I'd recommend 'French In Three Months' and 'Pimsleur's Language Program'."
5,You truly are an exceptionally talented individual...,This is yet one of the best CD's I have purchased. His music truly touches the soul! You rock Massari!
2,Not that great,"Product works and is well constructed.However there is way too much hiss.Possibly because I used it through a digital amp, but there should have been a warning if that is the case.I have not tried through a solid state or tube amp, probably won't bother.Digital is here to stay."
2,Just use a good OD Pedal instead,"This pedal is well built and the lighted sliders are a good idea when on stage. The down side is all it really does is add noise and boost your singal like a od pedal. The sliders work good but it can be really hard to set and takes a long time to figure out the setting to match your amos eq. If you like to tweak this is great, if not look elsewhere. I found that just using my Barber DD gave better boost for solos and ryth parts and much easier to use and no noise.I am not saying its not worth buying but if I can get by with one less pedal I would use the money for this on something more needed."
2,Cold and clinical,"The Gershwin tracks are minimalist deconstructions sounding a bit clinical although they have their eerie and atmospheric phases. The James Brown interpretations have their amusing moments, especially in the audience participation and I suppose they go a long way to deconstructing James Brown' legendary Live At The Apollo set, but of course it lacks soulfulness, thereby completely missing out on the essence of James Brown's music. Maybe that is the point? The structure is there, but it's like a mere skeleton without the flesh of the soul, with the possible exception of Night Train which is quite rousing. I can't imagine this music having anything but an intellectual appeal. I prefer The Residents with Snakefinger doing their own stuff. The other album in this American Composer Series: Stars & Hank Forever, is more accessible and enjoyable.Stars & Hank Forever: The American Composers Series, Vol. II"
2,Great Watch bad Strap,"So this timex watch although the electronic functionality worked and continues to work flawlessly, the rubber/plastic came loose after 2 weeks of use.... Perhaps I was too rough with it. But I used it for running, swimming, and weightlifting, guess it just couldn't handle my workout"
1,An Alarmist spins a mythic web of global conspiracy,"The research seems thorough; the protagonists are evil enough; and the American victim is unsuspecting and unprepared. Yet, Bodansky's web of global conspiracy hinges on untested assumptions and unverified claims stitched together by an Islamic-phobia that belongs in a previous century. Bodansky shows his analytical weakness by lumping together every so-called Islamist from the Maghreb to Mindanao in a mythical anti-Western crusade. Bodansky falls within a long line of so-called policy analysts who have invented the clash of civilizations thesis by promoting fear and demonizing the other. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist, yet he is hardly the face nor mastermind of a world wide Islamist militant movement. He is an extremist, isolated by his theological and violent beliefs, with marginal support among the mainstream Muslim intelligentsia, professional groups, and working classes, dangerous to the West and the Muslim world equally."
3,Thought it would work....,"I bought it in hopes that my large collection of Disney videos would be transferred to DVD. On my first attempt it didn't work of course, I didn't even think about the Copy Rights. Bought an attachment that was supposed to override this & it didn't. I wish I would have read the fine print before spending the $$$.Any suggestions????"
3,Mature Characters,Emma is a widow who has just returned back to England after her gambling husband has died. Colin returns back to England after years of fighting in the wars. They are not looking for romance but breaks through the door.It was good for 10 year old book - lots has changed in the romance novel world.
1,Wrong Item Sent,"Ordered a five button key FOB for 2008 Honda Oddyssey Touring. Received a four button (does NOT have a rear gate button).amazon sent e-mail to replace item, but e-mail disappeared. Please, send info again and I will write it down. Thanks for the help."
2,"The mystery was okay, but I didn't like the sleuth","The mystery part was okay, but I didn't like our main character. Supposedly Sister Mary Teresa is super-pious because she's one of the few nuns who remains in her order and she's the only one who still wears the traditional habit/clothing. Yet she deliberately withholds critical information from the police (and, no, giving that information out wouldn't have harmed anyone), refuses to answer direct questions from the police, interferes in the investigation when told not to, and is known by her friends as willing to lie if it suits her detective purposes.I might accept (though not really like) these actions in a gritty P.I. with few morals, but I really didn't like them in a nun who's also supposed to be our heroine."
3,"If you use it, use the right amount","I didn't want to wet down the wood and preferred to do it the slow way, so I bought this product. The packet reads that 1 packet is good for a humidor for 25-50 cigars. So, I figured you need 2 for a 100 count humidor. Well, I patiently waited 14 days to open the humidor and it had only gone from 35% to 62%. Later on I read somewhere else that you need at least 3 packets for a 100 count humidor. I think this product does the trick, but they should adjust the instructions to advise people need at least 3 packets to season a 100 count humidor."
5,Does just what it is supposed to do.,"First off, you need something ""else"" to put your cigars in while you season your humidor. I suggest the largest Tupperware bowl you have with a tight lid. Put them and the old Boveda pack(s) in the bowl and seal it. Then take this and throw it inside your humidor. Leave it in there for about 1 to 2 weeks depending on how poorly you have been keeping your humidor at 70%."
5,They Mayfield Four 'Second Skin' Album,"One of my all time favorite singers/songwritters, I've been waiting a long time to get my hands on this album.Album was in great physical and audio condition, minimal scratches and clear audio."
1,Don't waste your money.,These guys should sing country songs. All they know how to do is whine about how terrible life is. I was given this cd as part of an industry promotion. That is its only saving grace. If I had paid for this garbage I would track down the band and make them give me my money back. It would be like that scene in Strange Brew when the audience chased Bob and Doug down the alley. But I digress. The unfortunate thing is these fellows all seem like good musicians. They are handicapped by the quality of the songwriting. It might be time for them to start trying to write their own material. It would have to be better then what they have now.
3,No tracking number and delievery was too slow,I am not sure if this product was too popular at that time. It took a long time for the seller to ship this product after my order. The email notification from the seller didn't include the tracking number. I had to wait until my order passed the estimated delivery date to send my inquiry.
1,Not pleased,"You know that over $300 original slashed price posted above?? Total sham. These are your run-of-the-mill SAWDUST particle respirators that you can get at any local hardware/lumber store. They are not made for use with any kind of gaseous materials such as aerosol sprays, nor for viral/bacterial protection. It states as much on the packaging.I ordered these on Amazon, same product page/listing except it listed a different seller at the time and they took FOREVER to arrive. Almost TWO months after ordering they finally arrived in a beat up box that was half crushed. The 3 boxes inside were in pretty bad shape on their own, too, shipped that way from the seller.If you're looking for N1H1 Flu protection, best to bypass these and look for something specifically designed for that type of protection because THIS isn't it."
3,Pleasant experience,"The product is comfortable to wear, and easy to breathe through. I am not sure how they hold up against swine flu , cause by the time we got it .. the swine flu virus was in recess."
1,Particle respirator,"Although lower in cost and usable, the product is rather flimsy and appears much lower quality than the more pricey double yellow-banded N95 mask. Personally, I will not re purchase."
5,Filthy Divine Kicks Ass!,"OK, I like it! They have a great diversity of sound and they really kick ass! The guitar work borders on brilliant and their lead singer is total eye candy! I'm anxiously awaiting their next release - c'mon guys, when's it coming out?"
2,TMM V.7,So... I started this series when I was in middle school and never finished it and the unfinished set on my bookshelf really annoyed me. Series is cute overall... nothing too special.
4,Wait for GX-310,"To all who are interested in buying a GX-300, I suggest you wait for GX-310, which obviously is the descendent of the former. GX-300 is good, and GX-310 is only better, especially 3/4"" thinner and 800 gram lighter.The new model is now available in HK (where I live), and I learn from a UK retail website that it will be launched in Sept there. Don't know when it will come to the States."
2,Poorly made,"I received this light for Christmas. Reading the description of the item, it sounded perfect for what I was looking for. An occasional use flashlight with a lantern option for power outages, etc... Unfortunately, this item is not made well and I cannot recommend for any use. Within 24 hours of purchase, the original light bulb burnt out. I replaced the bulb, but found that the florescent light would now constantly flicker. I think the problem was that the battery contacts aren't tight against the batteries, as I whenever I moved the unit, the light would flicker on and off. Also, you can't use both the florescent and flashlight at the same time (not a big deal to me, but maybe for others). I ended up returning this light. Hopefully the quality exhibited by this flashlight is not indicative of other Coleman items, as I've been very happy with any other Coleman item I've purchased."
4,It was a book rich in building self esteem.,"I read this book because of the controversial review it received across the country, but especially in the state where an elementary level teacher lost her position for bringing it in as classroom material. As a parent I am always interested in the standards of the academic systems in America. Schools are the most widely used forum for inviting curious thinkers to explore.Nappy Hair is a book about admiring those things that make each person unique, and special; not about being different and less worthy. It brings cultural awareness to a critical pinnacle, and tries to show the beauty of diversity.We all grow up within a certain heritage, which is comprised of a palette of characteristics;spiritual, emotional, and physical among them. Nappy hair is an adventure in the richness of a culture that is full of history, and a gift to be shared."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"The show gets five stars, but ADV gets zero. I can't believe they made us buy the first twelve volumes of saint seiya and then not produce anymore. Its been over a year since they realesed volume twelve and ever since they haven't released the rest of the volumes. I'm pretty sure that we can all be asserted that the rest of the volumes won't be released. WHAT A RIP OFF!!! Hopefully that in the near future a decent company can take on the task of releasing the whole saint seiya series. It is truly one of the best anime of all time. Please saint seiya fans, show your support so that saint seiya is fully released."
3,Im Happy but no satisfied,"I bought the two of the collections and their good, and I like the company that made this collections of movies finishes doing all of the volumes. I know Poseidon its a good challenge, and I like to watch that again. So please get to work guys and release the other part that we know its the best part."
3,Good but could be better.,I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I picked up this booked but I did expect a little more than what I got. The content was ok and the images superb but the whole book felt like he was critiquing his own images and giving tips on whats good and whats not. I constantly had to read the title of the tip to recall what that critique was about and what I can learn from it. I'm giving it 3 stars because it has great example and tips but it would have been four had the retail price not been so high because I don't feel that the content was enough for the price.
4,"Fun lens, but not the best quality","A fun lens for the price. It takes a very steady tripod to shoot with this focal length as the smallest vibration becomes a large shake at the end of the lens. I cant see it getting much use in my lens arsenal, but if you need to zoom way, way out, it can read license plates from many blocks away. Dont buy it as your only telephoto, but if you know that you are getting what you pay for, its not a bad lens."
2,A ho-hum Spider-Man book...,"I'm going back to read all the Marvel books (I have just recently completed my collection), and will post reviews on all of them for people who still care.Fist up is Spider-Man: Venom Factor by Diane Duane. This is not a good book to start off on, but oh well. This book is bland and, worst of all, boring to boot. The action scenes are poorly done and not at all exciting, and the ""character development"" scenes between Peter and Mary-Jane consist of talking, eating, and having sex....not necessarily in that order. Yes, we know they are a married couple who are attracted to each other, but we don't need their ... ...high school-ish innuendos every time they speak to each other. There are better books for you to read then this one. AND this is just the first in a LOOSELY tied together trilogy that doesn't get much better from here...sigh."
2,Too heavy,"This watch was not running at all when I received - the battery was dead. Also, it was far too heavy for me. The crown would not pull out properly."
5,Great comedy with wonderful actors.,"This is an amazing documentary about a great show, with a lot of wonderful moments. It's very appropiate to laugh, to think and to learn about how to make a very good comedy."
1,very dissapointing,"I love Jim and all but this book was very questionable. The poems were poor, nothing special or different about them. He should go back to writing prose. If you like his poetry a lot than maybe it's worth getting, but I personally think it's his worst book witten."
2,"Berry, berry bad.",It broke before it was put together. The parts are not very durable. The drums kept falling off. I wanted to send it back but I decided not because of the hassle. WOULD NEVER BUY SUCH A PRODUCT FOR MY GRANDSON AGAIN.In actuality I would rate it NO STARS.
2,meh,"I've read other Scandinavian-region mysteries, and I had high hopes for this book due to good reviews, but I was disappointed. It was honestly so boring I didn't bother to finish it, and I got a little past half through it without any action besides the main death. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Be careful!!!,"This book is exactly the same as ""The Sacred Alter"" also sold on this site. If you have one, do not get ripped off on the other thinking you have found a new Larsson title you did not have. The story is great. It is Amazon I am giving the lowest rating available for this ripoff."
2,Choppy writing and unlikable characters,"Maybe this book lost a lot in the translation, but this book comes across as written by an author who has no idea how people interact with one another. The relationship bewteen Rebecca and Saana is stilted and the dialouge is awful.The basic plot is okay, but I suspect part of the author's message is to bash Christian fundamentalists. Ultimately the idea that 3 people acted together is too unbelievable. Very surprising that this book won an award. The final suggestion of a relationship between Rebecca and her boss is also pretty ridiculous."
2,Disappointing and beware,"I purchased this book as one of the Top 10 Swedish Crime Novels. It was mostly a disappointment. Gimmicky in places, and most important, don't purchase if you are offended by animal abuse. A dog is tortured - needlessly."
4,"Great for plasma / LCD, nor fot CRT.","First off, I'd like to address the first moronic reviewer. Just because you are uninformed about the product, doesn't mean it should take away from its review. Next time get a clue and do your homework.That being said, this is a great player. A little pricey, but still great. It works a lot better with a LCD or Plasma though. With my 34"" Sony CRT it works great at 720p, but I noticed a little bit of flicker on 1080i.If you got the extra bucks, go for it. But personally I would wait for the next generation of Bray or HD-DVD players or discs. A dvd MASTERED in HD will be far superior to just an upconversion."
3,Good for the price,Very cheap price! Almost impossible to beat for a 1000 pound jack.Although the way it was engineered has some play between the mount on the trailer and the jack itself. As well the crank doesn't lock and spins when moving the trailer by hand.
4,GREAT SELLER - POOR PACKAGING BY MANUFACTURER,"I LIKE THE JACK AND THE SELLER DELIVERED IT TO ME PROMPTLY. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTURER NEGLECTED TO INCLUDE THE WHEEL SPACERS AS DESCRIBED SO I'M UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION."
2,towpower 74410 jack,the crank part works great so far. the swivel mount is sloppy and if you look at it looks like it`s leaning .
5,just right for my needs,"Fits very nicely onto the Northern Industrial Utility Trailer, i purchased the 40in. x 48in. trailer for hauling around a scooter store mobility scooter for my mother. this trailer jack and wheel makes a very nice addition, with it down the trailer is more like a little cart and it easily moves around the scooter."
3,Finding God in Scripture,"I think a lot of people, like me, would order and read this book simply because of the author. But, of all the books on lectio that I've read this was probably my least favorite. There are many other authors who give a much better explanation of lectio that is much more concise and relevant than this book. At times the book seemed to wander and I found references that did nothing to help me better appreciate this ancient prayer form. Basil Pennington has written far better books than this one."
4,Good Map,Better than the maps available free from tourist spots. It was very helpful since not all roads connect where you think they should. Careful - some roads are not for the timid driver! Many times we found ourselves backing up a one lane road around a corner to be able to pass another car.
2,"Ok, not glossy","This product is named as being 'glossy' but you should know that laser printers don't really have that glossy effect that you get with a printed photo out of a booth. I bought this paper to print some of my own pictures but the way a laser printer lays down the toner you always get that matt look. The paper, aside from the printing matt, isn't 'glossy' in my opinion. It's shiny-ish and whatever shinyness you call it is on both sides so you could print both sides if you want. But even if i'd used it with a laser printer it would not be 'glossy' it is just a little bit shiny and a thick paper. Don't buy if you're hoping to print pictures."
1,HP Photo Paper 220g,"HP Laser Photo Paper 220g will not work on the HP Color LaserJet CM1312. The roller smears the ink all over the paper. I thought I might have gotten a bad paper batch, so I returned it to Office Depot and bought it again at another Office Depot. The result was the same. If you buy the HP Brochure Paper 160g, 44 lb. instead, it will work perfectly and is actually the same laser photo paper, but not as stiff. In the beginning I called HP to find out how I could eliminate this problem, they wanted to charge me $25.00 to get the answer. I told them to go FKthmslvs and did the research myself."
1,No contact,Tried paper in four different lazer printer on campus and at no time did black stick to paper. I tried contacting seller but no response came. Waste of money and my time.
4,Geronimo Stilton will be a hit,"Meet Geronimo Stilton, the mouse editor of The Rodent's Gazette. He is a conservative mouse that is swept up in a treasure hunt to locate the Emerald Eye. The text is fun using various font styles and rebus type drawings. This fun romp is perfect for children 2nd grade and up. This would also be great for kids that have enjoyed the Series of Unfortunate Events. Mouse Island and Geronimo will be back in future titles in this new series."
1,not great!,"I received a sample pack with my pump. Love the pump but not the pads. I had already been using the lansinoh pads and liked them but ran out so I used the free ones. They don't stick well, and get bunchy by the end of the day. They were just not comfortable for during the day and nursing at night."

4,"Alchemical Poetry, 1575-1700","Recent studies of scientific discourse have amply shown that Francis Bacon's ideal of a ""transparent"" language of science has hardly been realized: even the blandest scientific prose is implicated, often without acknowledgment or recognition, in rhetoric and ideology. Despite our increasing awareness of the instability of all language, however, no one would advocate a nihilistic reversion to alchemy's obscurities. But by reading poems like those printed here on their own terms, and yet with a critical eye to the cultural forces that inform them, we can appreciate some of the richness they had - and sometimes still have. It is time to recognize, in other words, that alchemical poetry has more than a merely antiquarian interest."
5,Not for small children,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old who absolutely worships Spiderman, but the glove was large for him (and yet a perfect fiton me, an adult).Because the glove was too large on him it got in the way of the silly string so we ended up just taking off the glove and strapping the toy to his bare arm which worked well. He was able to play with it and shoot every villian toy he could think of. But it only lasted about 5-10 minutes of fun.I thought the idea to also include a water gun/pump was great, but that was even a bigger dissappointment because it was much larger than the silly string container, so much in fact that he could not even bend his arm at the elbow. Hopefully he will still want to play with this toy when he gets older and grows into it.Good idea for older Spiderman fans.p.s. Moms, be sure to wash all silly string off as soon as possible the purple string stains on some surfaces if you do not act quickly."
3,Good Read,"Great book. It was interesting to see the similarities and differences in all the diary entries. Some were funny, some sad. Very interesting!"
5,Now Available in Paperback,"Applied Nonparametric Statistics, second edition, by Wayne W. Daniel, published by Duxbury Press is now available in paperback."
3,9 Songs,With all the hoop-la surounding this movie I expected more. Rent it if you can & then purchase if you still want it.
4,Erotic and short,"This is a love story with an unhappy end. The music is what we want to listen to from typical new English bands, in my opinion too much music and not so much story. The film is short and it seems that at the end something is missing. But what is amazing -for art house films- is that sex is explicit and real. This is one of the most erotic films I've ever seen."
3,"Yawn, with an occasional woodie","They're attractive, you have to give them that, but their sexual encounters aren't really that hot, overall - and the film on the whole is quite boring."
3,"Adequate intro to the topic, but NOT one of the best","Forget this book if you are a serious researcher or student of the Battle of Stalingrad. Get Joel Hayward's acclaimed ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" and Antony Beevor's great ""Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege"" instead. Also check out anything by David Glantz and John Erickson. Get THIS book maybe if you've never read anything on Stalingrad and want a clear and basically accurate introduction."
3,A detailed account of the horror of Stalingrad,"This is a solid account of the hellish battle for Stalingrad. Hoyt is at his best when he has ample detail to illustrate just how horrible this battle was--the tales of Germans cracking horse bones for food, stories about men's feet freezing in their boots and the insanity of fighting floor to floor in a building. It's muddled in parts, but I generally enjoyed the book and would look for more books from Hoyt on World War II."
1,Envy?,"Ok, far as I could tell, this book is all about two things. Envy of the author, and trying to make light of all his values. Clancy obviously values the armed servants of his country high and I fail to see why this is cause for diverse derisive comments about him as a person.Mind you, I haven't read all of this, I could't stand to. I think the Clancy books stand on their own, without anyone having to do their best clobbering him for his great writing.Read a Clancy book and form your own opinion, don't buy this highly colored collection of defamatory sentences."
2,Atrocious Sound Quality,"Based on the samples alone, I can only imagine this is a bootleg made from someone's miniature cassette recording.As it stands, it could only interest those desperate for every possible scrap of historical material. Not even worth the shipping cost for someone who enjoy's Basie's music."
3,It would be a good toy if it all worked,"The toy was missing 2 small brackets, which there should have been 3 big and 2 small and we had 5 big - which makes it impossible to connect the 2 small drums on top, which is aggravating to buy a toy and not be able to use it all because of incompetent people on an assembly line and a lack of response from the company to replace these parts. Don't rely on the headphones cause when they are plugged in it is almost impossible for the child to hear the music. They love the toy, though. I have an 8 year old boy and 4 year old girl and they both love it."
3,Good book for military history and tactics buffs,"A very readable analysis of George Washington's military career, this book is not for the casual reader but for those more interested and appreciative of 18th century warfare tactics. I found the detailed descriptions of the battles interesting but it got confusing when the author gave detailed troop manuevers regarding terrain and topography. If I was already more familiar with the battlefields I might appreciate and understand the descriptions of the battles. Overall it was pretty good and very readable, I just got bogged down in the detailed battle tactics at times. Also this book covers in detail the engagements that Washington himself participated in and narrowly glosses over other battles and events of the American Revolution."
4,"well written, but too negative","this was a good book, but it turned the way I thought about George Washington around. I enjoyed reading the book because of the descriptive battle scenes etc."
3,"Ok, But Not Great","This book didn't capture and articulate the struggle of the Continentals in the manner in which ""1776"" by David McCullough did. It merely laid out facts in a straightforward manner which wasn't that inspiring and quite aseptic. I usually judge the greatness of a book by how often I highlight passages by the author. The cap stayed on my highlighter for most of the book. For students of the era it's a book worth reading, I simply wouldn't put it at the top of my must-read list."
3,Could Be Shorter,The first chapters are excellent and then it went down hill for me. Less credible or valuable in insight towards the last of the book.
2,Doesn't work with some Timex watches,I guess I should have read the description better. Does not work with the Timex Ironman Run Trainer. I thought all ANT+ watches worked with all ANT+ Sensors... aarrggg.Frustrating.Just make sure this works with your watch.
4,Does the job. Can't give 5 stars because of how pricy it is,"Very pricy replacement for the one I lost that came with my watch. However, props to the manufacturer for making it a no-steup replacement that takes less than a minute to sample and start giving accurate readings."
2,Does not work with Timex Ironman Race Trainer,"Timex Ironman Race Trainer T5K217F5 is not compatible with this strap. So ignore the statement here that it works with 'all' Timex models such as....Still on the quest to find a replacement strap for my Timex Race Trainer...FYI, Garmin replacement strap doesn't work either. I'm now $60 in to attempting to get a $150 watch functioning again."
3,Dim Sparkle,The pictures look prettier than in person. The edges have frayed and sadly this case is wearing its time...and I've had it a week. However it is snug and fits nice and it'll be a case I keep as a back up.
3,"Looks Good, Fits Loose","Case looks great but fits loose on the i phone 5, you can feel the phone move around in the case."
4,"Cute case, decent quality for price","Cute case. Fits phone well. A few of the sparkle things fell if when I opened it, but I just put a few coats of clear nail polish on it and I haven't had problems sense. Overall good case for the price. I would recommend it."
2,"Amusing, but weak.","The author strikes a few funny notes amid a sea of generally flat prose. But overall, the reader is left with the impression of someone who's bragging about simply switching the people he lets define his views for him. I suggest a funnier title and more revealing approach to take (and I do mean this sincerely, if it's done well) is ""Confessions of a Born Follower."""
3,The Return,"If the author's intention was to create a grouchy old man who grumbles about everything then he succeeded. I felt the description of Van Veeteren's poor behaviour distracted from the real story of the book, but then again maybe it was the real story."
3,Texmati,I sometimes do like sticky and soft rice which is the case for this rice and it is flavorful. But to call it LONG GRAIN AMERICAN BASMATI is only accurate for the AMERICAN part. This rice is nothing like any kind of Basmati by any strech of imagination.
1,OK for those unacquainted with the game,"If you know little about how baseball ""works"", this book is an excellent introduction. However, if you've played organized ball at Little League or above, you will discover nothing new about the game."
2,Wanna get lost?,"This book is great for giving directions to most trail heads. Once you leave the parking lot and head out on the trail you're on your own. The maps in this book are useless. They are 3 inch by 4 inch maps with very little detail. The maps show the main trail you would like to be on, but fails to show the many many trails that are unmarked and look just like the main trail. This could be the fault of the forestry or park service and also the book. The book maps have no trail numbers whatsoever. There are dashed lines and arrows to guide you. When it comes to an intersection of three or more trails your guess is as good as flipping a coin. The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one or none is because it does get you to the trail head and describes what you might find along each trail if you are able to stick to the hike you choose from the book. I would not suggest this book or the Sierra Club book for Inland Northwest trails they're both useless."
3,good info,"I like that this provides some extra info and makes it easier when shopping, however some of this info is available for free online... overall i would still suggest this unless you plan on shopping and being on the web searching at the same time..."
1,Disconnects frequently ... Don't buy,"Initially it worked for a while; then it started dropping connections. Every time it does, you need to restart the router to get it connected. This piece is a total waster -- Don't waste your money and time (on debugging it)."
4,"BFS rep record, what?","Bigger Faster Stronger (BFS) is educating and inspiring source for anyone who is interested in sports conditioning. Written especially to sports coaches BFS gives good framework for integrating strength training into almost any athletes training program. Sections covering speed, agility, flexibility and plyometric training completes the BFS system.The basic motivator built into BFS system is measuring progress and breaking records. However I totally missed the 'rep record' concept. How exactly it was meant to be recorded at different weeks and how the record would get broken? Example record given only added confusion."
1,Not mfg. by Thermos - wish I had read the reviews,"This ""vacuum flask"" is NOT manufactured by Thermos, even though that is the brand name listed for the product. To be fair, ""Thermos"" is no longer a registered trademark [...]but it is listed as the Thermos brand on Amazon, and it is clearly NOT a product mfg. by the Thermos company.Amazon was happy to take it back without any hassle, and I am now ""conditioned"" to read the reviews on every product I intend to purchase ;-)"
4,A BIBLICAL CHALLENGE,"A penetrating insight,examining the biblical contents within the time frame in which they were written. The author's opinion is thoughtfully presented and substantiated by meticulous research. A recommended challenge is presented to all, especially biblical enthusiasts."
1,Not correct part,"The Amazon system of making sure you are ordering the correct part for the car has ALWAYS worked for me. This time it did not. It was obvious upon putting the cap even close to the distributer, that it would not fit. When I purchased the correct one from the Honda dealer, they were obviously very different. I was also distressed to learn that OEM were the initials of a manufacturing company, not original equipment manufacture, but that is not Amazon's fault. The problem of it being the incorrect part is probably also due to the manufacturing company, not Amazon at all."
4,A great read for Christians...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this title. Although I am no Christian scholar, I am well informed about my faith in Jesus. I think that this book has given me improved insight into the faith that a Jew who lived in Jesus' era might have had."
2,It did not seduce me,"I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova - his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallstr√∂m's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at - it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.2.5/5"
4,"A travelogue for anyone wanting to see Venice, Italy","Not the most exciting movie, and not the most detailed transfer, but this is almost a must if you have ever been to or want to visit Venice, Italy. This film is like what a real estate agent tells a businessman about the most important thing in opening a retail store -- Location Location Location. And, if you don't like the location, you will not care for the movie."
5,casanova,this is a wonderful period comedy/drama it has good music to go with the story it being set in 18th century italy.an excellent film with good acting and good humour.
5,Don't Compare This Movie to Felini's Casanova,"If you are looking for a purely entertaining light-hearted movie, this is an excellent choice. The movie is fun, beautiful, and with an excellent cast. Don't compare this movie to Felini's Casanova, but both are well worth seeing. The story has very little to do with the historical Casanova, but so what? Once you start watching, you are in for quite a ride!"
3,Heath Ledger Lacks the Worldly Wisdom for this Role,"Heath Ledger is an introspective Casanova in this otherwise outrageously amusing conglomeration of events and characters. CASANOVA does not fail to entertain. Oliver Platt as the ""Lard King of Genoa"" definitely steals this film from the entire cast as a corpulent suitor. This is one of his best performances leaving an indelible mark for his range of histrionics. Also, Jeremy Irons once again demonstrates his mastery of for the dramatics as the Vatican's grand inquisitor sent to finally put the issue of Casanova to rest. Starting off as a powerful character he ends up in some outrageous buffoonery showing a new side of his array talents. The film is vastly amusing starting slowly but coming to a grand crescendo."
4,A path full of symbols,"This book tells us about a symbolic path (a mixture of egyptian and grec symbolism) which is as the same time the travel of an initiate. This book is an enigma at each page but it can give us good esoteric clue if we are ready to receive it. We have to meditate on symbols and their true meaning. On my point of view this book contains highly magic components and it is the reason why it is so hermetic and can't be understood by everybody. Anyway the contents seem to be very deep. But since I am not wise enough to give a correct advice on the interpretation of different symbols given in this book, I suggest that you read this book and decide if it is helpfull or not!"
5,"It's ""Perfect""","this CD/DVD set was perfect the contains 3 great music videos and great acoustic performances! The CD was great as well all of the songs are amazing there is nothing wrong with this CD, it is a must have if you don't already have and your a flyleaf fan! the price is perfect! really, thats cheap for a CD/DVD set! You have to get it have TO!"
3,Solid,"Considering it's a debut, there's not a lot bad that one can say about it. Flyleaf does a good job on establishing their intended style and the lead has an amazing voice. The only gripe I have is that they don't have much range in their music, and it's hard to distinguish between songs, but if you are certainly interested in their style and sound, then this CD is a worthy investment"
5,Not much to add...,"It has pretty much been said in the many reviews here.To Recap: Lacey is a world talent - always a welcome find in any genre. The entire band simply rocks raw.Songwriting is just as important to this group, though. Cassie is a particular standout. The story told so simply and to profound effect. Check out the acoustic version, as well.Yes, Virginia, Metal can be art."
5,Picture doesn't do it justice,"I was a little nervous about ordering this wall sculpture, because it was a bit difficult to tell what it looked like from the picture. Well, I have to say, I like it even more than I thought I would. The sculpture is made of iron and seems to be solid. It is beautifully hand painted with gold accents. It has two levels of trees/leaves (one in front of the other), which give the sculpture some dimension without looking cheesy or gaudy. I'm a lover of simple lines, and I really like this wall sculpture."
4,Instastart definitely worth the money,"We took this stove camping in December. Our friends brought their pump up liquid fuel stove...which wouldn't light. It was a windy weekend and the Instastart never failed once. It was a pleasure not to have to deal with matches or a lighter. The burners worked fine too. As soon as we returned home, the next morning our friends bought the Instastart Grill Stove, too."
1,Awful! Don't waste your money! 1 Star is to much,I bought 2 of these when Toys'R'Us had them on special. Even that was a waste of our money. Both had to be returned within the first week. One never worked and the buttons on the other 'stuck' all the time. The replacements weren't any better. Even though we had the buyer protection plan it didn't do much good...since we bought them on 'special' they will only give you a player/or fix it up to the amount you initially paid for the item not what it actually retails for. It just isn't made very well:*the buttons stick and can easily becomed jammed*the lid that covers the USB port can come off very easily*the ear buds are poor qualitySpend your money on something else. You get what you pay for I guess.
1,Yuck??!!!,What's with all sickening sweet discussion about marriage? Can't someone talk about this like an adult???
1,Not worth the trees killed to produce it.,"I ordered this book based on other Amazon readers' comments, and was horrified and disgusted at my choice. The suggested readings are very nice, since the author did not write any of them. The rest of the text is poorly written, silly psycho-babble. I doubt anyone wants their wedding benediction prayer to end with ""depart with joy in your heart and happiness in your feet"". I did get plenty of hearty laughs out of the suggested ceremonies, but unfortunately, no constructive assistance."
4,Weddings from the heart,"This book was a great place for my fiance and I to start some dialoge about what we want. Both of us have been married previously and it was an excellent way for us to compare what we had before, and design a ceremony that is unique to us as a couple. We took a pen and circled parts we liked from several ceremonies and hope to compile them into one. This book came recomended to me and now I see why."
1,Waste of Money,My mom bought this for my boys at wal-mart. total waste of money. you have to dip the blower in the tray of bubble solution and it leaks all over the place..and then to fill it with the smoke is a nightmare. basically it leaks all over the place. you have to constantly squeeze the trigger to get bubbles to blow WHILE holding down the smoke button. Not possible for a child to do! Its difficult enough for an adult since you have to pump it the right amount of times just to get one bubble and then have to dip it again!
1,Difficult to get bubbles,"When I purchased, I assumed, we have to fill some liquid inside, and it will generate bubbles on button press... But we have to dip the gun-tip in bubbles soap, and the air produced by gun generates bubbles.It needs six batteries. I was thinking, batteries are used to generate smoke bubble, as such to generate bubble(without smoke), I don't see much batteries use. Better, if some mechanical thing could have produced enough air to generate bubbles. Air produced without batteries are very less.Even with batteries, rarely good bubbles are formed, and most of the time, few ones or none.Smoke produced by the gun, also give burning smell, not really good for kids."
1,terrible product,I got this smokey bubbler for my daughter to add to her easter basket...It is a rip off...it blows a lot of smoke like it should..but it blows no bubbles. It doesnt work. The commercials show it blowing tons of bubbles and it wont blow one single bubble...My daughter was very dissapointed and so was I.
4,Barnyard Valance,"This valance went with all the accessories we purchased for the bedroom of my grandaughter when preparing for the baby shower of her Mom. The baby's gender wasn't known at the time so this theme was PERFECT! The whole ensemble was well-made, pastel-colored and adorable!"
3,I was disappointed...,"This is not at all what I expected. After paying this much for a book that I expected some very steamy reading. This was not the case, the story was mediocre at best and very little steam and that wasn't until almost the end of the book. Very disappointed."
5,"One hot, sexy book",I stayed up reading The Lady's Tutor. I look forward to reading it again and again.............Thank you Robin Schone for a book that shows how embrace desire and passion.
2,"Great on eroticism, but not my cup of tea.","I thoroughly enjoyed the underlying theme about an unloved and under-appreciated wife and mother of two wanting to explore her sexuality and improve her marital relationship with her husband. I enjoyed storyline and the characters of the book......until I discovered the homosexuality ""events"" in the story. This was not my cup of tea."
2,stereotypic,If you want a book with alot of sex you should get this but however it was a terrible book it should have been better written it categorized people in the most inane way firstly by making the people imagine that English women are better off then Muslim women or basically most women in the world it doesen't make sense and i think before this book was written Robin schone should have done a little more research on the subject before releasing it to people it was very offensive.
2,Overhyped and Overrated,"Is this book erotic and hot? Yes, in several places it is, while other parts are more silly than sexy. The characters could have been better developed. I was also majorly turned OFF by all the gay bashing and homophobia."
2,Partial Story,"This review is for the $4.99 Kindle version. This version is the original magazine version, which is only half the expanded story published later in book form. If you want the full story, buy the $0.99 Kindle version. The description says nothing to indicate that is the shorter version."
1,Junk-in-a-Box,"Don't waste your time or money on anything within the ""Zenith"" Wireless Command product line. I purchased this unit to operate indoors to be used as a motion activated lighting system for use on my kitchen under-cabinet lights. The first day this product worked well. After the first 24 hours the receiver stopped working altogether. After unplugging and then plugging back in the lights started flickering when motion triggered the receiver to turn on. I swapped out receivers and they still flickered. I eventually boxed everything up to return back to Home Depot where I bought them. I purchased two similar systems by utilitech from Lowe's that were cheaper and came with a handy remote that works wonderfully and is a lot more versatile in setup and operation. They have a 140 degree detection radius up to 40 feet away. I live in a concrete block home and they work as advertised."
1,"Not as advertised, not useable, not dependable, WASTE of MONEY",It is a surprise to see a name brand item perform so poorly. There is no secret fix. It is simply BOGUS. After 40 years as an electrician in several industries and an afternoon of disbelief the conclusion is this should be taken off the shelf. The other reviews tell the story. No stars because even one star suggests it is possible to make it work with great effort or repair. Two sets only worked for a couple of cycles then had to be reset by removing batteries and wall power.
1,Very poor wireless range,"The first unit I bought did not work. I returned it for another one. The second unit worked, but the range for wireless was less than 10FT. Again, I returned the second unit for another one. The third unit had the same wireless range (under 10FT). I would not recommend this at all."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","I had to go see this movie for 2 reasons: 1. It was shot at my school, and I wanted to see how they showed it off. 2. I knew a couple of people who were extras and made it into the final cut.I was a little surprised by this movie because it wasn't as bad as I anticipated it would be. It was actually rather entertaining. The story wasn't too out there and Claire Forlani looks good. Prinze was the same as usual, and Jason Biggs was pretty funny. Some of the little details were off...nobody lives in the same dorm room 3 years in a row and there's no such thing as a blonde electrical engineering major. The Claire in college looks almost exactly the same as the Claire in high school. Freddie's nerd to cool guy transformation is a role reversal from She's All That. Monica (the singer) is in it too. Nice little cameo. Overall, not a great movie but not bad. Pretty entertaining."
4,4 and a half but it's not an option!,"Well, I'm a 16 year old guy. That should say a lot right there. This isn't just a girl movie (or maybe I'm just sensitive). I don't know, this is one of those movies that you get stuck watching to it, but when it's over, you're so depressed because you wish your life would be like that. For me personally, I see a connection, because Freddie Prinze (Ryan) plays me so well - structured, smart, iron. Claire Forlani - she plays another person I happen to know. I bet you anything there's plenty of people out there who see a real connection to this movie, it's awesome, don't buy it, but definetely rent it.P.S. For the guys, this is a good date movie, right up there with Down to You."
1,Worst Movie Of The Year,this is godawful. the scene in the night club is the worst thing ive ever seen. i feel bad for jason biggs. freddie prinze - stop making movies.
1,Not Spiral-More like a magazine,"I ordered a SPIRAL BOUND Beginner Guitar lessons by Quincy Carroll for 19.95+ 3.99 shipping. I'm very upset. Looks like a cheap magazine and is not spiral bound. No where on the cover of this book/magazine is the writer's name. I don't know if its on the inside since I'm sending it back. The front picture is different so, I don't even know if Quincy Carroll really wrote it. I will not pay for a book with such a dishonest sales description. This is not worth 19.95. There has been no answer to my email to the seller, Imagine This (name of co, not sarcastic comment thought its appropriate). Covered with a plastic bag is not shrink wrap. Most upsetting is the magazine type book I received for 5 times its true worth with the quality of something like a grocery store recipe magazine. Don't buy anything from them."""
1,Don't buy a Craig!!!,"This is the third Craig MP3 player (all 256mb, but different models) I have tried for my kids and I have not been pleased with any of them. The software is not user-friendly and the players keep freezing up. I my just be spoiled by my iPod, but these Craigs have been a waste of money. [...]"
4,Trans mount for 92 XJ,"I noticed my exhaust sagging a bit and upon closer examination, I saw that my mounts rubber was a little melted. This part fit perfectly on my 92 Jeep Cherokee 4.0 auto and now I no longer have a strange thumping I used to hear when going over speed bumps (was probably my exhaust hitting the crossmember."
2,very basic for a book,I don't know... I was expecting more on AS and this book is like a nice Flash 8 manual... if you have patiente to see Flash 8 documents don't buy this book...
4,Salutes to Lepon,"I was glad to see this oppressed information get the circulation--and additional scholarly backup the topic so thoroughly desrrves. The Scientologists' Citizens Commission on Human Rights has been trying to wake people up to psychiatry's atrocities for years, but were always shouted down. As more authors like Lapon do their homework, present facts clearly, dismiss the pressures of the psychiatric community, and keep an organized format, America may finally wake up. Maybe we should have listened to CCHR 20 years ago...or was it 30?This is an unsettling read, but so are books about the holocaust. Psychiatry is America's white-coated holocaust."
3,"Good work, but beware","It is imperative that we take a close look at psychiatry and at the humanity behind the patients and behind the treatments. The thing is that there are good psychiatrists who use medications and other treatments correctly and their patients do very well. Scientology does not all the answers for the world's ills. Each case must be handled independently. If you have questions, get second and third opinions.This book is done well. Again, we have to remember ALL the people with disabilities who were slaughtered by Nazis - not only those with mental illness, but those with mental retardation, people who were blind, etc."
5,An Outstanding Book by a Great Poet,"This work focuses on Baca's deep connection to his homeland of New Mexico. The poems show a profound understanding of the connections which have developed between the rugged landscape and the people who inhabit it. Baca has found a trove of metaphors for life and living in that environment, yet never succumbs to flaccid sentimentality in his poems. This book has a very special quality: it is accessible to every fan and student of poetry---indeed, it often speaks to you seemingly without your having to read it."
1,PAINFULLY BAD,"You've just bought ""that book"", you finally get home, turn off the phone, settle in front of the fireplace and dig into...oooh, that hurts! Ouch! Painfully bad book. Badly written, badly edited. Everything about it is hurting."
4,Small Enough To Store In A Tight Spot,"I picked this up to keep in my hiking pack. It's small enough so that you wouldn't notice it when you have it in your pouch. I haven't actually opened it up to see everything in it, but I've read it's contents and it looks to be enough to sustain for a day or 2."
2,"Decent, but it broke and they told me to buy a new one","I had been very happy with this scale.Then, today, I turned it on and it was reading oddly. I called up customer service, got shunted around a bit, finally got to the right person, who was nice and explained that the behavior meant it was not calibrated. He then went on to say that it could not be calibrated and ""we recommend you buy a new one."" End of story.This scale is less than two years old and has been very gently used. I'm not happy with that and will look for a different brand to replace it."
1,"Very Happy Before, Very Unhappy Now","I used this scale for the past couple of years and had no problems, but now I am having the CAL problem described elsewhere. I tried the taped dime suggested here but that makes no difference. The scale displays the test of the LCD, then CAL. After a little while CAL fades out. This unit sat by itself on a shelf with no mistreatment. I admit that I haven't called the manufacturer, but based on the other comments, I see no need to add to my frustration."
4,"Good show, okay recording","This is a great opera! Albert Herring is one of Britten's best. This recording is a good one, however, it does not do complete justice to the depths of the opera. To get a true sense of the opera, I believe that it must be viewed, and that an all-star cast is essential. Since this is not a very easy thing to accomplish, however, I believe that this is a good alternative."
1,Out in Left Field,This book perpetuates the well-worn leftist myths about the civil war in Spain. It is history rewritten by a former reporter for the Soviet TASS news agency.
5,Help for Youth Ministry!,I was recommended this book at a church leadership conference and purchased it shortly after. This book will not disappoint you and is well worth the money spent. It can be used to get youth and workers talking in Sunday School or Small Groups. I have also used it to spark discussion in my weekly emails to people in the youth group as a youth pastor.
3,Errors!,"As others have reviewed, I am 15 cases in and have noticed half a dozen or more blatant errors. Frustrating to read and makes studying more time consuming."
4,Very detail,"If you want a frog or toads to became your new pets, read this book it'll keep their life."
1,Bugs in it,"After using the rice twice over several months, I was cleaning out my pantry and saw bugs crawling around in the rice. The jar was tightly sealed and nothing else in my pantry had bugs. My only conclusion is that the eggs were in the rice to begin with. Gross!"
1,horrible display on kindle,they shouldn't allow this book to be downloaded on a kindle (paperwhite). The font is tiny and can't be increased.
4,A Great Chapter Book,The humor is great for children and adults alike.The colorful illustrations also make this a super choice for beginning chapter book readers.
5,Among the best books on Excel VBA,"""Writing Excel Macros with VBA"" is an excellent book on the use of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for Microsoft Excel. Steven Roman provides a significant amount of information in a relatively short volume.While this book is accessible to Excel users of a variety of skill levels, it is best suited to numerically-inclined and experienced users of Excel. The book offers a good introduction to the VBA programming environment and the Excel object model.Steven Roman has written the best book on Excel VBA that I have read to date."
2,reference... sort of,"I have to say I'm very disappointed with the book. I usually expect great things from Oreilly books and this one fell short. It's an ok reference, but it's not big enough to be a complete reference. It tries to cover a lot of ground and ends up not doing each topic justice. There just isn't enough info on each topic.It seems like it'd be great if you're already an expect macro writer and just need a reminder about what certain functions do. If that's not you, then this book is probably not for you."
2,NOT DELUXE~ lower Rummy game,"Game case was broken when purchased, this is very cheaply made, you could get splinters from the wooden racks. Tiles are good but would not recommend this one, Pay more for a better deluxe version as this one is NOT."
3,Plastic Racks,The game arrived in a timely manner and the case was black with red stripes and did not have wooden racks. The racks were made of plastic. I have a game with wooden racks and that was what I expected. I feel that a product should match its description.
2,Yuck,The face looks somewhat like Frodo and the sword lights up. Those are the only two good things about this action figure. Other than that the legs are distorted looking and the feet look even worse. It can't even stand up without leaning back on the rubber cloak. Plus the painting is shoddy. There are definitely better Frodo figures out there that are worth the money. Only buy this if you want to be disappointed.
2,"decent, but...","i thought the movie was decent overall, though definitely lacking something. the thing that just killed it for me was the narration! who ever thought that was a good idea?? it's a bit overkill."
1,"bad movie, good cast","This movie was way too slow moving for me, and the story wasn't even good! It's about this girl named Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), who works at a Sears-like store...see, it was so boring I didn't even catch the name of the place she worked at. Anyways, Mirabelle meets a guy at the Laundromat named Jeremy Kraft (Jason Schwartzman). They are a couple for a while, and then when Mirabelle is working one day, a gentleman named Ray Porter (Steve Martin) asks her out to dinner. Knowing she was still involved with Jeremy, Mirabelle accepts (lucky for her he isn't a murderer). The thing is, Ray is married, and he's just using Mirabelle for sex. In the end, Mirabelle goes back to Jeremy and lived happily ever after with him.It's so sad that such a great cast, Claire Danes, Jason Schwartzman, and Steve Martin, had to make a bad movie. Well you can't make all good movies!!"
1,Drudging,"This is definately one of the most boring movies my wife and I have ever seen. There's a reason why Steve Martin belongs in comedy. This is clearly one of them. At a turtle's pace, this movie goes on and on, with the colorless narration made and written by Steve Martin. What for some might be romantic comments throughout the movie, for my wife and I were simple, monotonous frases. The whole thing just didn't fit together. The movie just didn't put us in a romantic mood. And we kept waiting for a slightly faster pace to kick in. Something that never happened. We were just as bored as Claire Danes looks on the front cover."
5,A Fork in the Road by Paul Prudhomme,"Although I have not used many recipes, the book is certainly a wonderful way of cooking healthy without loosing the flavor. I purchased the book ""used"" from amazon marketplace and was very pleased with the condition of the book as well as the way the transaction was performed. I would give her a 5 star rating."
1,"Not impressed, really.","I recorded this from PBS this week. I found the last third to be very politically correct in sympathy of the present social climate. I am sure that if taken historical instance seperately from 560 A.D. (although this video would note it as C.E.) on, there would be quite a different picture painted of how and why Jerusalem was shifted form one group to another."
4,Very informative.,Very informative - watched twice and will review again. Good coverage of all three religious connections to the Holy City. Recommended for anyone wanting a quick overview of Jerusalem and its history.
3,Doesn't fit Tikka T3 and no O-ring,"First, let me say it never claimed to fit my Tikka T3, but I thought it would. The lever part won't quite seat into the bolt area, so I plan to work on it to make it fit. No port to apply oil to a patch inside. Also, no O-ring to really seal at the chamber point. But, I paid less than half of other options, and got far more than half their functionality!Also, you only receive one bore guide, not four as in the pictures. I thought you got four guides sized for each sizes from .17 to .243 range."
2,chairs,Would not purchase these again. One corner of the back was chipped off and it looked like someone stained over it. If they had been for me I would have returned them. They were a gift and the person wanted to keep them. To me they were very cheaply made. This is my first purchase from Amazon that I've been disappointed in.
5,"These are not bar stools. Only 24"". Choose the 30's.","First, these are NOT bar stools. If you want a bar stool select the 30 inch version. These are 24 and not listed as such. You only get the 41"" over all height. Go for the 47. Please learn at my expense.Otherwise high quality and well made. Unfortunately I'll either give them away or use for firewood and re-order. It will cost me 2 hours and shipping to sweat returning them."
3,"Nice stools, dinged up on arrival","The stools are nice, decent quality, easy assembly. The only issues is that there were several marks and scratches upon arrival. Nothing too noticeable but not in perfect condition. (And not bad enough to deal with returning them.)"
4,beautiful,"The chairs are beautiful, but they were a bit of a pain to put together... I plan on ordering another set eventually though... hubby gets to put them together next time... very well priced and sturdy... chair seat cushions aren't very thick, but I plan on recovering them all to match my dining chairs eventually, so that can be fixed when I recover them... all in all. I would recommend these if asked"
1,Like Frankenstein writing about brain surgery,"I know three people who worked for the author and her biography should be filed under mythology. The book itself borrows heavily from The One Minute Manager which is far better written and laid out.Certainly no 'turnaround artist' since the company had 18 employees in the 1990's and laid off to today's 15. A very high rate of turnover, and more tension than working as an undercover police officer.All management decisions came from only her, and at least weekly yelling arguments between her and husband, or directed towards some poor employee could be heard echoing throughout the halls. Some employees had to endure the indignity of babysitting her child as part of their expected job responsibilities. 'Management' at it's worst."
1,Unbelievable!!!!! Get real!!!!!,"I worked for this woman for 15 months. While what she says in her book makes sense, she really ought to practice what she preaches! I bailed after 15 LONG LONG months to go to work for a real company...instead of her tinker toy company."
3,From Lyrical to Libelous--Diverging Views of the South,"""My sister says Southerners are like other people, only more so.""--Blanche McCrary Boyd""Southerners speak music.""--Mark Twain""For all its size and wealth and all the 'progress' it babbles of, [the South] is almost as sterile, artistically, intellectually, culturally, as the Sahara Desert.""--H.L. MenckenQuotations by and about Southerners. Some are good, some bad, and some ugly. Some are even accurate. I wouldn't have bought this book myself, but having received it as a gift, I enjoyed it."
2,Cheap? Not really!,I wouldn't buy one if it only give 7 hours battery life. The lower price you pay initially is quickly eaten up by batteries. Get a Panasonic unit that gives you well over 30 hours.
2,Returned product,These boots literally rubbed me the wrong way (right at the ankle bone) so I returned them. They`re not for me.
5,Outstanding as always!,"I have ordered six pairs of propet' shoes from Amazon. If you are on your feet for long periods of time, you would be well advised to try a pair of these village walkers."
4,Dolphin,I bought this for the tub and was disappointed that it sits on the bottom it does not float. The good part like all Safari Ltd. toys they have the animal names on the bottom so if you are learning their names you have a reminder. Overall it is a great educational toy as long as you don't expect it to float! Safari makes a large assortment of aquatic animals that are great for learning and a great price. My favorite in our collection is the manatee!
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Spider-Man in his glory days. Seminal Ditko work, with not so much crazy Stan Leeness. A neurotic, nerdy, geeky, scrawny science student, not a stand up comedian superhero with a supermodel as a girlfriend. Everyone picks on and makes fun of him, in general. This makes him mad. Then as Spidey the media and the police don't look him, and his uncle is dead. Life is tough as an arachnid."
2,Steep learning curve - program guide confusing.....,"Unfortunately - in the 8 months I have had the HX-900 it has never workedwith my Motorola digi cable box - making the TV-Guide funtion useless. It workswell when manually programmed to record a specific program at a specific time ona specific channel but requires your cable box to be left on at all times. Also - I find myself disconnecting the DVR and running my cable around it so I can see HD channels - which will not go through the DVR. The hard disk has many nice options for quality and has 160G of storage. The dubbing feature (to the built-in DVD recorder) is pretty easy - and tells you how much space you need, how big the program is, etc. The title keyboard is ridiculous. You have to scroll everywhich way to name the programon your DVD (a function of the TV Guide info not getting through).Disappointing considering the unit cost over $1000 - and I only hook it up when I need to record a show. Get a TiVo and a DVDR!!!"
1,Sony is not standing behind this product!!!!!,"It was working fine for first 6 months and >>> it die, 1st it stop reading any disc and then hard disk fail, I was very upset with this and contact SONY, 1st they told me that because i purchased on-line (through AMAZON) i am on my own, after 20 min's call and lots of arguments they ask me to ship at PA address and i have to pay for shipping, i am not sure when i'll get back this product, if you are buying for the name brand, stay away from SONY, ones you have a problem and even if you are under warrnty, the attitute from Sony will be ""tough luck"""
5,Great Customer Service!,My order was filled and shipped quicker then expected. I purchased Super Trimec and just sprayed the yard with it today. I have some tuff weeds but have my fingers crossed that this will live up to the good reviews.I have used other Trimec products with good results and think this one will be as good or better.
4,Good stuff,"I am a great sales rep, but this book is kinda OK too. It is so good I see some of my styles ripped off here. I know they must have spied on me. Not unusual because I know that companies like IBM, Toyota, Microsoft, GE and GM have observed and copied me,"
1,"DON""T BUY SONY M-2000 TRANSCRIBER!","I record minutes for a meeting of physicians. This transcription unit is relatively new, and As I rewound the microcassette to review, the tape is barely moving...Also, the volume is never high even after turning it to highest level of 10! Thank goodness, I have a back-up with another small recording device combined with notes of minutes. This TRANSCRIPTION UNIT SUCKS! Now, I must ask for approval of another transcriber unit - I'll try the Olympus! School of Medicine Administrative Assistant"
2,Not As Expected,"Sony M-2000 Microcassette Transcriber/RecorderI purchased this Transcriber after using a 3M-Harris Transcriber for over 20 years. The Volume is a definite problem. Even with the volume turned all the way up, voices are muffled and very hard to hear. Also, when the foot pedal is activated, there is a loud clicking noise that sometimes overrides what one is trying to transcribe. I have tried numerous headsets in an attempt to get better sound quality and, so far, the best is the headset that came with my Sony Walkman (Model SRF-M86V). However, the sound volume and quality are not perfected with this headset -- but much better than with the headsets I have used that are designed to be used with transcribers. I WILL be shopping for another transcriber -- and will write this one off."
4,Works Well With Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.2,"I was using my dsl on my G5 to share via wifi to a Mac mini. Before I switched to this router it was very slow on the mac mini. Well, my neighbor had an open wifi and when the mac mini connected to it was much faster. So I presumed they had a non-apple wifi router so I went looking for one myself. Now, I've put this router in place and everything is very, very fast on the mini! Nice. And you can lock it down to only your wifi devices via the mac address. Neat and easy.As a side note... on the G5 and during the testing of this router, I used an extra Ethernet card in one of the PCI slots. I found, much to my surprise, the PCI card was faster that the built-in Ethernet! Much faster. ;)"
2,Not truly VPN capable,"I'm not going to comment on Vonage as a Voip company, but I can speak to two issues:1) this router has real problems with the VPN pass-through function, so forget about telecommuting with this one. It works, but often only after 4 or 5 tries2) the stability of the wireless connection is poor. I've had much better experiences with my (pre-Vonage) D-Link router."
4,Good&cheap product,I bought this product on 7 February 2008 and since then no problem. Very good web interface and many settings you can change.
1,Terrible device,"Not much to say here. I bought this and for months had a delay when I answered the phone using Vonage. I'd say ""Hello? Hello? Hello?"" and after 5-10 seconds someone would answer. At first my friend suggested that my phone was bad!Not only that but when calling out it'd take 3 seconds to hear a dial tone.I replaced this with the new D-link Vonage Wireless router and the problem was instantly fixed! Too bad I can't return this defective product.Works fine as just a wireless router though. I've had no problems with using my laptop wirelessly using this device."
1,Came apart right away,The sticky paper worked fine but the handle came apart on me. I could tell that they'd done a poor job of gluing it together. I ended up supergluing the handle back on and it works fine now.
1,Pretty -- Pretty Useless,"This book is nothing more than a few nice pictures of web sites w/ a disscussion of the ""theory"" behind their sites.I returned this book. I have tons of reference type books w/ differing levels of usefulness and this is the 1st book I have ever returned.I only gave it a 1 because there was no zero."
3,The pictures can stimulate some creativity,"Since any designer wants to keep on top of what's going on in the industry, I thought it good to take a look at this book. I've gone from cover to cover a few times, but not to read it. After beginning I quickly realized the information is pretty basic and can pretty much be found by speaking with other's in the industry.However, I did like some of the screenshots of various sites considered ""great architecture."" Often times, I flip through the book to generate a few ideas when putting together suggested views for sites in development.In all, not much new information, but may be worth it if you're just starting out and just need to know or need information reinforced."
5,Pago Pago and more,"These are amazing short stories - witty, poignant, and exciting.The range of entries is very wide, so you will move quickly from, say, Alaska to Vietnam....but always engaging. The writer's use of language is better than most of the stuff I read. It would be wonderful to take on an airplane."
4,Great for the price,I wish the lights were brighter as I have this located on a top shelf near a wall on a medium sized room. The lights on the opposite wall are a bit dim but does the job anyway.This is perfect for karaoke parties. Line up some ABBA songs and watch people sing and dance the night away! :)
5,She was dead,"At time this was filmed, Joan was clinically dead. Altho she remained animated and spoke words out of her mouth, it was obvious that she was dead. She played a person who walked around sort of hunched over and had something to do with some sort of ape person whom she had once been married to.This was her last film and possibly most distinguished role during her dead years which occured shortly after Bette Davis kicked the behoozes out of her in Baby Jane."
1,Poor Joan,"An aging Joan Crawford tries to maintain her dignity in a silly prehistoric-monster romp from Great Britain. Even by low-budget horror standards, ""Trog"" (1970) looks as bad as it sounds. Crawford did not mince words about her inglorious cinematic farewell: ""If I weren't a Christian Scientist and I saw 'Trog' advertised on a marquee across the street, I'd think I'd contemplate suicide."""
4,generally happy,"I've had this phone for about a week now. I've recharged it twice, battery life seems to last a few days, less if I use the phone alot. The PCS Vision features are really nice. I have my email forwarded to my phone for certain people I need to get back to right away. My only complaint is that during calls, the people on the other say I'm breaking up sometimes so I would say call quality is not as good as my old A460 (the screen died on that one which I hear is a common problem). I gave the A760 four stars because of all the features but if I had to rate on call quality alone I'd only give it three. I'm leaning towards keeping it because of the other features but may also see what other phones are out there before my 14 days are up."
4,A fast and intriguing read.,"When I first started to read this book, I wasn't sure if I would like it. It was very graphic and Victor, the main character, just didn't seem able to relate to. But after the first 30 pages, I was hooked. As the book moved, the writing became more fluid and Victor became more refined. When it was over, I wanted it to be longer.This book is for those that are open minded, that's for sure. Those that don't want their beliefs questioned would not like it at all. There are some graphic bits of homosexuality too. I thought this would bother me but as the book went on, it felt natural for the characters.I would recommend this book for those looking for a fast and enjoyable read."
1,"If you're serious about vampire literature, DON'T READ THIS!","Before becoming a vampire, the vampire character in this book knows Jesus in the flesh. He is madly in love with Jesus but Jesus is too dedicated to God to give in to his sexual advances. After becoming a vampire, the main character decides he is going to get revenge on God by becoming a monk and wiping out monasteries throughout the world. The entire story is ridiculous. This 2,000 year old vampire, being so old and having experienced everything, is bored with every situation he encounters...making this very boring reading!"
2,Ridiculously amusing,"The complete lack of reality and character developement left this book at a level which I have seen condemned in fanfiction pieces.Victor was a one sided character. He displayed rage and lust, usually one along with the other. I found his character and the plot so amusing that I admit to reading both this and the sequel. Jesus is tempted by this raging Roman soldier who stalks him? And this Jesus likes to shed his clothing and dance about the hills? Being a Catholic and having gone to a Catholic school I've heard most of the Jesus jokes out there.This book was the longest and most prolonged joke I've ever read."
4,guide,"better than official books but does not teach a lot of tricks or about unusual transactions we encounter in bookkeeping, but was worth the price"
4,This comes as no surprise!,"What makes NRBQ so great? They are ultra-talented musicians demonstrating their chops in a fun way.This solo work showcases what any and every NRBQ fan knows already...Terry Adams is a very gifted pianist and keyboard player that can easily steer his craft towards jazz,swing and classic music.This is first rate musicianship. Interestingly, he employs a NRBQ-ish sense of fun to liven up these pieces."
3,"Great idea, but don't fit as well the as the front set","These provide good protection, though not nearly as good as the front set. The fit leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. It is a two piece set, and I can't seem to get them to sit right no matter what I do. I am not wild about the way that the piece that provides protection for the middle set just kinda flops on top of the other piece. It gets kicked around a lot and though it doesn't move much, it's still really annoying and doesn't provide the best protection. They seem a little too short and don't extend nearly far enough under the seats... and for a vehicle with such little legroom in the middle seat, this is a drawback. I think that these things could easily be improved. They are a nice set of mats, but for the price, I expected a lot more. They don't provide much more protection (if at all) than any other full length floor mat."
3,Consider another Mindy Jostyn album,"Mindy was a truly gifted artist. Although ""Five Miles From Hope"" is not fully to my liking, her album, ""Coming Home"" is a must have!!!! It inspires me every time that I listen to it...which is several times a week."
5,Old School,"I purchased this as a gift to my two young daughters, but endend up using it with our neighbors, we are middle age, but we still know how to disco, our kids loved watching us."
3,Needs some work,"This is a cute idea with the 1950s kitschy theme, but it needs some fine tuning. The size is smaller than a photo album which is handy, but that doesn't allow for a lot of room to write recipes.The photos and quotes are cute. There are sticky pages where you can paste photos or recipe cards. But again, this book is a scaled down version so an elaborate recipe won't fit on one side. The folders seem a little skimpy if you have a lot of recipes from magazines and newspapers, but for me (not a big cook) it works.They could've left out the pasta section and separated the vegetables from the side dishes. I think there are too many recipes to combine them into one section. Overall, it's a cute original funky theme. But it lacks room for hardcore cooks."
2,"Disappointed - 1 broken, 2 weak","I just received my order for three of these crank flashlights. Buyer beware.To start with, one of the three was D.O.A.. Either it failed to charge or the switch was broken. In any case, no light at all.Both of the others worked, but were disappointing. The plastic is cheap feeling. The cranking is noisy. The light is okay for a few minutes, but dims quickly, even after a minute of vigorous cranking. It provides no where near the claimed thirty minutes of light, unless a small trickle counts.Perhaps this is the best a three LED, hand-cranked light for around ten bucks can do with current technology. And it's not bad if you need five minutes of decent illumination without batteries. But I wouldn't recommend it as a replacement for a good battery model."
1,Doesn't work and PoolToy.com won't accept return!,"This toy never worked. The props tried to turn a couple of times and that was all. PoolToy.com won't accept a return on remote-controlled boats, cars, etc. so I have to work directly with the manufacturer. This boat is so poorly made I don't think a replacement will be any improvement. There's a good chance I will be out $42 (when I include shipping). I'm disgusted with how an item at this price can be so poorly made. My 8-year-old was terribly disappointed with his Christmas present."
4,Interesting,A bit of jazz comes to classical in this interesting collection of pieces for a variety of groups. Spirituals enter in via the poems and we have a very pleasant CD that works nicely for casual listening.
5,Best Version,This is the best version of Dicken's story on film.Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of movie.
4,ugggggggggg,This speaker is great but in the first 2 weeks it froze 2 ipods within 20 min of play time. The sound quality is great. I was quite impressed with the sound but the fact that you can't play it for very long kinda ruins it.
5,Better than Bose,I have both the Altec and Bose in my home the altec has better bass and the bass and treble are adjustable. The bose is easier to use but this is well worth the money in my opinion.
4,amazon harassment,why is amazon harassing me to review this product? i get an e-mail at least twice a week asking me to review it. why?
1,no review,"it arrived on time, but was the wrong color, I ordered the black and was sent the white. Return was no problem, picked up by UPS as instruction directed. Credited account within one week. Emails kept me updated."
5,inmotionn im7,Works great an sounds awesome an good price fast shopping bin lookin for one for a while an finally found one
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,The iM7 Portable audio was great for a couple of weeks then one day it just went out. Every time I put the volume up the power would shut down. I wish I could send it back.
1,"BAD DESIGN, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, BEWARE","1. The tiny wireless remote that comes with this speaker set is the ONLY WAY to change the bass/treble settings. If you lose it, you're screwed. I lost mine, and when I tried to replace it, Altec told me that they don't have replacements in stock, and they have no idea when they'll get more! The guy on the phone told me they ran out because ""people lose them so often."" If people are losing the remotes that much why are they not in stock?!2. When I was removing the power brick that comes with the iM7 from the outlet I had it plugged into, one of the brick's prongs snapped off. When I tried to replace it, I got the same response as for the remote... ""don't have anymore"" and claim not to know when they'll get more. So now my speaker unit is a brick.This was a horrible customer service experience. Avoid these guys. A decent set of computer speakers will cost you less and provide better sound."
4,Great Sound But cheap holder for the ipod.,"I like the sound that comes out the speaker. I think is better than the Bose, but one thing i don't agree with the cradle. I have hard time try to open it. If you don't care about the cheap cradle, the system is worth the money."
4,Altec Lansing inMotion iM7 Portable Audio System,PRO:Great sound at reasonable price for my ipod.CON: The remote keys too small and not very efficient
5,Excellent sound,Altec Lansing inMotion iM7 Portable Audio System for iPod : Ready for international travel. Plugs into european outlets w/out any problems (adapters included). It's LOUD and clean. Can u say BASE. U will be satisfied. I was.
4,Not Bad for the Price,"I am very pleased with the iM7. Sound quality is very good, even when played at a higher volume. The remote doesn't have much range to it, but adequate. Taken care of, this product should last quite a long time."
5,"A,mazing sound from a little box","All I can say is WOW! If you are looking for crisp, clear sound from a small portable unit, this is your choice. I bought this for my daughter because she wanted to listen to her Ipod in her room and while taking a shower (hence the need for portability). My only complaint is that the subwoofer is so powerful, that when she is listening to it loud, you can feel the bass throughout the house. The spatial quality of the box is incredible. If you set it across the room, the music seems to fill the entire room with no distortion at all. The door problem that people have complained about appears legitimate. The door does appear fragile, but simple cautious use appears to solve the problem."
5,Nice System!,"I like my Altec. Good sound. Great design. Easy to navigate through, including with the remote. Can definitely recommend this (in fact, got it for one of my co-workers as a wedding gift, and she loves hers as well)."
4,One Word.....AMAZING!!!!,"I highly recomend this product, sound is great! it just plain rocks!!! trust me, you wont be dissapointed!"
5,Fantastic Sound System!!,"This is one of the best ""toys"" I've ever bought. The sound is better than I expected. Not only can I listen to my i-Pod music, but also tunes stored on an older MP3 player. So much flexibility. Even a video output. Isn't technology great? Hats off to Altec Lansing for a fantastic product."
1,"Decent product, but HORRIFIC customer service","I bought the iM7 system in April 2007 and like it from the beginning. It has decent sound quality. But in May 2007 for some reason the A/C power supply malfunctioned. So I called up Altec Lansing's customer service and placed an order for a new power supply on May 7th 2007. Its June 25th today and I have not yet received my power supply. I have called them 8 times over last 7 weeks and every time they sympathize with me but nothing gets done. I don't want to spend money on buying annoying batteries, which they are not ready to reimburse me for anyways. Is it going to take 2 months everytime I have a problem with this product. My final words. Good product, but just hope nothing goes wrong with it."
3,"Speaker hiss, fragile door, and cheap remote. What happened Altec?","I returned this item for the speaker hiss. Who can listen to these things with that transformer hiss ever present? I purchsed the original inmotion back in the day and love it. I can't tell the thing is even on between songs or in quiet portions. I was looking for an upgrade and found the opposite.Pros: Nice design. Hides the ipod away from most damage although my new nano required a mail in adapter.Cons: Mediocre audio quality. Fragile door system. Mine didn't break as most complain of, but it didn't seat properly and was poorly made."
5,Very good value for $$$,"I purchased the iM7 from Amazon after giving it a test run along with a few of its pricier and less expensive competitors at one of the big box stores. The iM7 easily provided the biggest bang for the buck in terms of price and sound quality. The price at Amazon was about 100 bucks cheaper than at the big box store and I used the money I saved to purchase a good battery charger and 8 rechargeable batteries.Pros: The sound is one of its biggest selling points. It can go pretty loud before the quality begins to suffer. The unit also provides very nice bass considering the size of the speakers. We have used the unit both indoors and outdoors and the sound quality is great either way. It comes with a remote which we rarely use, but it's nice to have nonetheless.Cons: The unit takes 8 D batteries, so it can be somewhat heavy for a ""portable"" speaker system. It also came with travel adapters which are useless to me since I would never take this out of the country."
2,Great while it worked...,"....I considered this vs the Bose SoundDock, and made my decision based on on-line reviews (here mostly), slightly cheaper price, and the fact that my 50+ year old ears can no longer appreciate all the range of frequencies, especially the higher ones.I also preferred the look of the iM7 over the SoundDock, as strange as that may seem.So, for several months it served its purpose, and gave me pleasure . But after only 7 months it quit working; no sound and the door would not close. Therefore I have to rate it only 2 stars. Had it lasted, it would have been 5.I guess if I pay $200+, I expect a little more than 7 months use before taking it to a electrical recycling center."
5,EGYPTOLOGY RE-INVENTED,"A marvellous introduction to the work of R.A.Schwaller de Lubicz. A must read for anyone contemplating the study of ""THE TEMPLE OF MAN"".Well done John West!"
3,"Convoluted, somewhat interesting departure from the Japanese ghost movie","Pray seems to have multiple personality disorder. On one hand, it's a somewhat interesting story of guilt and forgiveness. On the other hand, it's an uninspired typical vengeful ghost story. Throw in some forgettable secondary characters and the supernatural, and you've got Pray. The story takes a while to get going, and the ghost story part seems to have been tacked on as an afterthought. If you're not familiar with the Japanese ghost genre, then I would recommend Ju-On (The Grudge) or Ring. If you've seen those, their sequels, and the also-rans, and are in need of more, then Pray may be for you. Just be sure to manage your expectations."
5,a stitch in time worth your time,"in this book the author tells of the life of the cardassian tailor, elim garak. i am one of those readers that thought the aforementioned character was underused on the series, ""deep space nine"". what i liked most about the book: the narrator does not try to show garak as a saint or sinner. in many star trek novels characterizations are too often drawn in black and white. this one is not done in this manner. what i liked least: unlike many star trek novels the plot does not move in as linear manner. a final note: the average cardassian would probably not feel out of place in great britain's elite public school system."
3,Great story. A lot of OCR problems,"It is a great story and a must for anyone who wants to enter the DS9 ""rebirth"" universe.However, be prepared for many mistakes in the Kindle version.There are some obvious ones and some that are harder to figure out.I even got the impression that in one or two places there are whole paragraphs missing.Didn't totally ruin the reading but did detract from the enjoyment.Was still far better than buying a printed version which is prohibitively expensive."
3,Buy the book...but not on Kindle,"If you're at all a fan of Garak or curious about the state of Cardassia following the defeat of the Dominion, you will enjoy this book. Robinson does as marvelous a job bringing Garak to life on paper as he did on the screen (and there was enough research and nods to continuity to make this lapsed Trekker very happy).However, I would encourage potential buyers to track down a physical copy, as the Kindle edition is simply terrible. The novel is riddled with typos and scene breaks, and even whole chunks of text are excised; I reached my tolerance when I hit the line about the masks ""feces"" wear.Five stars for the book; two docked for the format."
2,choose something else,"I bought this for my 9 and5 yr olds and they love the premiseBUT the platforms to jump on are VERY hard to hit and you cannot save until you get thru the entire first level which is TOO much game time for kids!!! They didn't want to return it because the Midway games are fun but it was just frustrating and SINCE YOU HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN EVERY TIME, we bagged it for something else!!!"
3,Charlie Express!,"Although my product arrived in good time and in great condition, the cologne itself didnt smell good. It has a very amoniated smell to it. I'm sure it was because it was older cologne that is not really in sales anymore so I'm not really worried about getting my money back. Not everything smells the same after 15 yrs LOL."
3,"It's ""Alright to listen to while working""","TFSKMS@aol.com says it is a complete waste yet gives it 5 stars???? Oh yeah, ""aol.com"" forgot.If you go from listening to the early stuff then to this album you won't get it. Being a fan of the ""sound"" they are trying to get here I enjoyed well over half this album. To me, InSoc is about that late 80's tech-funk-synth, something I think they did fairly well. If Kurt ever releases another album maybe he should try that route again. That is if he is even still alive, InSoc.org has been down for how long now??"
3,Half-And-Half,"half these remixes aren't too impressive, half are alright. The Think remix, however, is very poorly done, with many times the vocals not matching the music in feel at all."
5,THE PHANTOM,This is a story about students that are going to put on a play but the phantom of the auditorium won't let them put it on becuse he dosen't wan't them to find his home.
4,del's griddle,I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law. She did not want it to fit over the burners but has used it and said she liked it.
5,Value packed 60 minutes of Schubert Chamber Music,"I have become gradually a real Schubert fan, along with the many over time who discovered this remarkable composer who didn't gain much fame at all until have his death when Schumann discovered his compositions and passed them on to Mendelssohn who shared them with the world.Having his complete cycle of symphonies in my collection, I desired some of his chamber music, and this provides it delightfully, primarily string quartet fashion."
3,Powers off on its own and Loses phone numbers,I have had this product for about 2 months now. The phone works great when it's turned on. Reception is kind of poor due to no external ant. i believe. The mobile phone also powers off on its own. I have found it has also been losing phone numbers. I have had the bios updated and brung it back to the sprint store 3 times. Each time they says the phone is fine. I have asked for a replacment phone and all they can off is some free phone that sprint can't not give away at the moment.
4,A good and durable phone,"I've had this phone for about six months now. I'm pretty clumsy and have dropped the phone MANY times and other than a few small scratches in the plastic the phone still works like it did the day I bought it. I have not had any functioning problems with the phone.One negative is the way the phone fits to the ear. I don't think it is as comfortable as many other cell phones are and you do start to notice it if you're talking for awhile.One thing it doesn't have, and I wish it did, is a speakerphone.Overall, I've been very happy with the phone. It's a good deal."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I absolutely love this phone! But I am disappointed by what has happened, after today I will have had 3 in less than 3 months. I keep having a problem with the phone ""shutting down"" in the middle of a call (I would love to know if anyone else has expierenced this too), also the callerID quit working 3 days ago. The size, features, and ease of use make this a good phone, but with the problems I've been forced to consider another."
1,Only buy this if you hate playing checkers!,"I now realize why this set was only $5. The checkers are thin and cheap, and the chess pieces were small and cheap as well. I could live with that but it's the board that makes this a waste of money. It folds into quarters making sliding pieces difficult. The board was heavily warped right out of the box. This is not the thick paperboard board anyone over 30 is gonna remember for your childhood. The board is no thicker than T-shirt cardboard and just as flimsy. I wouldn't recommend this checkers set at any price. Please disregard any positive review if you enjoy well made board games."
5,A history book written like a novel,"Unlike normal event-name-date-place-next event history books, this one is written to be read. It draws the reader into the story of the social and cultural interaction with the development of technology. It is a great read for anyone interested in how we got to where we are."
1,I can't believe I wasted precious brain cells reading this book!,"If you are just looking for a book to read on the beach, this is for you.This is the first book I have ever read in my life where I felt that my time would have been better spent reading something else.I felt like the author tried way too hard to make this a ""good"" book. I would say half of the chapters in this book could be deleted due to repetition or superfluous detail. There were a few chapters and MANY paragraphs I just skipped right over because she was going on and on and on about something.I think the problem with this book is that there isn't enough depth. The plot started out promisingly, but the author hinged onto just a couple details and just beat them (and me) to death!"
2,Memory loss..and time goes on and on and on....,"While initially intrigued with this book, I soon became bored in reading the same details over and over again, feeling stuck in the same place too often. I agree to with some, that this book could have been shortened some, mostly with the boring details of Abby's trips down her childhood memory lane. The book took a long time in getting to the point and bringing closure to the end. Some aspects of the story could have been more entangled such as Lisbeth and her cousins. The ending seemed almost unbelievable to me, desperation and a vain search happen upon an unexpected circumstance, seemed a bit shallow."
1,The point?,"A year of Fog, has a great storyline which should leave the person turning pages eager for more. But the story is filled with constant flashbacks which are sometimes repetitive and doesn't really connect with the story. It's always nice to have some background on a person, but she does it in a way that takes away from the storyline. Weird.She then fills ""space"" with endless random facts, some on memory, which after the 20th one you get the point that - Hey the main character just might remember something.I think she had a great storyline, but for whatever reason couldn't develop the characters sufficent to complete the chapters, so she through in alot of distracting information. By chapter 51, I gave up. Just too much excess information to wade through. I jumped to chapter 81 and polished off the book... Ending not bad, just a disappointing read."
3,"Liked the story, but skimmed large sections.","This story started off well and held my interest for the first quarter, but I found that the many facts and quotes about memory became tiresome and not what I'm looking for in a novel. The ending was very realistic."
3,Took a longggg time to get to the point!,This book was ok. Nothing to write home about. It was great at first and then it just kept going and going until you got to the point. A tad bit unbelievable but overall I would say it was o.k.
2,Snooze,"Once again, I'm reminded why impulse buying is a bad thing. Had I done a little research, I likely would have left this one on the shelf where it should have remained.A page-turner, it is not. I kept waiting for something to happen, maybe even a little interesting dialog, anything, but it never happened. If you're looking for a book to put you to sleep at night, this one will do just fine."
4,A definite page turner!,"Abby Mason, soon-to-be stepmother, loses her future step daughter on a foggy San Francisco Beach. The book follows her search for Emma, a search that continues even after Emma's father and police have lost all hope.Overall, this was an excellent book. However, the story did seem to drag on a bit. Fortunately, Richmond's characters and writing skill made up for this."
5,Read this book!,"I finished this book the other night and absolutely loved it!! I had not read anything by Michelle Richmond before, but was drawn to the story, as well as the fact that it was set in San Francisco.... and the cover is beautiful as well.It's so hard to find a book that pulls you in as completely as this one did... from the very first page I was hooked. And as much as I wanted to race through to find out how it ended, I made myself slow down so it would last. The writing was fantastic... the characters were believable... the descriptions of the locations were so vivid... the whole thing seemed so real that I now find myself watching small children when I see them alone to make sure a parent is nearby.I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great beach read... something they can't put down.Very much looking forward to Michelle Richmond's next book -- I will be on line the day it comes out!"
1,Foggy Book,"This book put me in a fog. I agree it could have made an interesting short story, but too far fetched. Why didn't the authorities go after the child's biological mother in the beginning? I highly recommend ""Deep End of the Ocean"" if you want a good read on a similar subject."
1,I Love Me Book,"The main character in The Year of the Fog must have had a super hero syndrome. She was constantly thinking what a heroine she would be by finding the child and absolving herself of any wrong doing by not keeping a careful eye on the girl. I am surprised she would pass a mirror and keep going.Meanwhile you have to struggle through her random thoughts about things that have nothing to do with the plot but I am guessing she enjoys meaningless trivia and piling on reader.One word of advice for the author. ""EDIT"". Get a pen out and start cutting out mindless discussion that have nothing to do with the story.I would recommend this book as punishment only."
5,Great swing!,"This is an awesome swing and my 6 month old son loves it. I would recommend it to everyone! I also love the tray, because he can have his toys on board as he swings."
5,Easy set up,This swing was just what we were looking for. My husband was able to set up it in just a few minutes on our porch.
5,"Best Swing, buy elsewhere and save $ 26.00 at least!!","Was getting ready to buy on amazon and checked Babies R us and bought it there for $ 19.99!! I checked Fisher Price and it is $ 20.00. This rip off artist is selling it for $ 46.99 on Amazon!! Best swing around, worst place to buy it!"
1,Do not buy,I got this for my 19 month old son. After returning two of them due the rope being so uneven I bought a differnet one. It was not worth the trouble.
5,Swing,Fast Shipping.... My son loves this swing and we swing in it almost every night. I would definately recomend this product to everyone who has a little kiddo.
5,Great Swing,My eight month son and the rest of the family think this swing is great!I love how it has a couple different positions to where they can be more propped up or more reclined. The tray is large and can hold a toy or some snack on it. Here is an idea for other moms or busy families: we have a pull up bar that hooks onto a door frame and we have hooked the swing from the pull up bar so even if you don't have that perfect tree outside or a swing set to attach it too or just to get some relief from the heat or winter you and your baby can still enjoy this swing.
4,"Daughter Loves, Wish Ropes were longer","My daughter, a small 16 month old, loves this swing and I think she will be able to use it for a while. We are using it hanging from a tree limb and I only wish there was an easier way to extend the ropes longer. We are having to rig a system with parts from the hardware store. No big deal but, since a lot of people use this from trees and porches, etc, it would be nice to have a little longer ropes."
5,My Grandbaby Twins Love it!,"This is a very well made product. I have twin grandbabies, a boy and a girl. They love to swing in these. What makes them super nice is the fact they have a tray which adds to better safety. The rope is super strong and much nicer than then metal ones. Love them and would highly recommend them for hours of fun and safety."
2,Fun until it flips,"Watch out for it flipping upside down. I have this swing and the Little Tikes one (both similar design), and whilst the Little Tikes one seems very stable in terms of keeping the kids upright, this Fisher Price one has tipped my kids upside-down on a few occasions. When they are swung far back, if happen to lean forward just before they start coming back forward again, this is when it seems to lose balance and leave them suspended head down. Thankfully the safety straps and the tray table HAVE remained in place to hold them in. If you do buy this item, I would recommend you make sure it is mounted high enough so that they didn't hit their head if they end up swinging upside down and freaking out. Supervise. And follow Fisher Price's caution of having it above a soft surface (eg chipbark or something)."
3,Good place to start,This is a good place to start and get the basics. The labs do not require you to trash your network and join the SelfPaced domain like the Microsoft counterpart. This book by itself will not leave you fully prepared you also need SQL Programming by Example! Even though Programming by Example is geared toward 70-229 (which you are probably going to take next anyway) to be fully prepared for 228 you need to see some actual code.
1,I expected much more from Osborne...,"I chose this book because of a few good reviews on this site, coupled with my success using other certification guides from Osborne. Up until now, I would have continued purchasing Osborne books. However, this book is VERY poorly written. There are blatant grammatical errors, and many of the sentences are so poorly written that, at times, my friend (who is an MCDBA) could not understand some of the concepts that the author was attempting to illustrate. If you are looking for good books to study for 070-228, you should definitely look elsewhere!"
2,"Its ok. Not bad, not great...just ""ok"".","I used this book to prepare for the SQL 2000 test (70-228) and it seemed like it was a very informative book. That is until you actually begin to use what you get from the book against whats in the test. The book doesn't cover quite a bit of material that is on the test, and gives you very minimal information about other things. It does cover replication quite well, and it has good information on setting up jobs/alerts/DTS/etc... It's a big book, but the vast majority of it is ""filler"" that uses overly complicated descriptions and LOTS of screenshots to walk you through tasks. Also, the included CD is useless. It has an a copy of the book on CD, and ONE sample test with just 45 questions (many of them from inside the book). I just passed the test with a 950, but thats only after I used several other resources to fill in the many gaps. Overall 2 1/2 stars."
5,Sosarme: wonderful Handel,"This two-CD set has apparently been released for some time, but is new to me. It affords the superb American soprano Julianne Baird yet another wonderful opportunity to shine as this country's pre-eminent Handel soprano, and the bonus of internationally recorded tenor John Aler as her partner is a real coup. This coupled with the knowing leadership of Handel veteran conductor Johannes Somary, who was unearthing works by this great baroque master long before the Hogwoods and McGegans got in on the act, makes for a terrific listening experience. And, oh yes, there's a dynamite Italian Handelian score as well!"
1,NOT IN STOCK,My class starts today and still no book is available to purchase. I am wondering why the publisher will not send amazon some books to sell!!!
5,Requisite Uncertainty and Strategic Flexibility,"The phrases listed in the title of this review will be spoken in business schools for decades. The Strategy Paradox is an excellent read. Thorough. Insightful. Researched. Raynor's approach to risk and return, and his application of this traditional financial term to strategy, is eye-opening. The best feature of this book, however, is the tool set you may use to manage an uncertain future."
2,I Expected Better,"I bought this book and thought ""Wow!!! All those songs for that cheap"". I got it and realized the reason for the price. The book itself is just a bunch of self-transcribed songs that were thrown together. I expected them to be accurate and a lot of them weren't. It frustrates me that I spent my money on something that wasn't worth it. I threw this out and ended up buying a few real books and a jazz real book. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Not that great for B Flat trumpet,"It's thick enough. Some of it is fine. But a lot of it is written for something other than a B flat instrument even though it is represented that way. And...there are more than a few pieces with more sharps than most trumpet players have ever seen in music written for trumpet player use. And there are also a lot of pieces with notes so high or low that I don't think any trumpet player would know the fingering for much less actually reach.I opened the book at random. Here is an example....if the photo will attach.<...>This book is better than nothing...but way over priced for what is actually a pretty slap dash publication. However, maybe that is why they call it a ""FAKE"" book."
3,Can't win them all,"Not what I expected. This kit is more like a toy housing model, I was looking for something more professional. I ordered it because this is the only kit I could fine quickly."
4,Cute doll,"I own this doll, and most poeple on this dont so you cant really judge it! This doll has cute clothes and awesome hair If you guys really want to stop this dumb little ""War"" whatever you guys call it just stop talking to each other! Your not even supposed to be talking it even says in the review guidlines. Anyway this doll is great! K3L7M5"
3,BRATZ! I CANDY PHOEBE. . hmmmm. . . . lets see. . . . .,"PRO'S:-Origionality was used while designing this doll.-It's colorful, and looks like candy.-One of the Twiins.-pretty, light make up.CONS:-Dry, messy hair.-Only one outfit.-a bit cheap.-Painted legs.-not very durable.- can be boaring.-the green makes me SICK!!If you buy this doll, keep it in the box and hide it under your bed. . . . .M~"
2,I kind of like her.,I LOVE how she has green and black. Very cool. But she scared me the first time I saw her and I am a little bit scared still. Anyways she is overall OK. Yasmin is the best. Buy Yasmin.
1,deshedding *solution only*,"I didn't try the shampoo, so this review is for the ""solution"" only. let me cut to the chase: 1.) it's very thick and hard to spread, 2.) leaves a gummy film on my dogs coat, and 3.) doesn't do much ""deshedding"". I had previously used a tropiclean desheding shampoo and solution that a friend (pro pet groomer) gave me to try and it worked fantastically; nice soft coat & much less shedding afterwards. since that product is available to groomers only I decided to give this a try what a mistake! so now I have a whole bottle of this sitting on my counter that I'll never use."
4,good product,good product just make sure you have the special brush or it doesn't do much. But I do have the brush . So will continue to order this product
1,jUST LIKE ANY OTHER DOG SHAMPOO,"WHILE QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THE FURMINATOR BRUSHES, I FOUND THIS SHAMPOO TO BE ABOUT LIKE ANY OTHER DOG SHAMPOO. IF IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ""HELP"" THE DOG SHED, IT DID NOT CARRY THROUGH. ALSO, IT DID NOT SEEM TO LEAVE MY DOG'S FUR SMELLING GREAT OR SOFTER THAN BEFORE USING THE PRODUCT. SAVE YOUR MONEY TO SPEND IT ON THE BRUSHES!"
3,Just another conditioner,"After investing in the FURminator De-Shedding Tool (which was the best $50 I've ever spent), I was expecting similar miracles from this ""deShedding"" Solution. However, after receiving it and reading the ingredients, it is apparent that this is just a very good conditioner. It contains many of the same ingredients you would find in a very good salon product for humans, but nothing special that will help with the shedding problem. So 3 stars for being a good conditioning product, but I held back 2 more stars, because it won't affect the amount of hair that comes off my dog."
3,"Interesting, but hard to read","I'd like to think I'm not a dummy, but this was hard to read. It looks to me like the book was translated to English by someone who might know more about Anthropology than written communication. There were times when I felt that maybe it had been run through Babblefish.Dissing of the translator aside, the author assumes the reader is completely knowlegable of all the apparently pretty divisions and differences in opinions between one group of scientists and another. Man I could care less, unless it leads to an advancement of a science, and I wasn't convinced. But maybe because I didn't care.There were times where I felt that a greater service would have been done if the soap opera would have been skipped.That said, the book contains some insightful and thought provoking ideas on how societies view each other and themselves. I found some concepts a powerful catalyst in my design efforts."
2,Not satisfied,Disco ball was very small compare to what I was expecting. Found much bigger. brighter and ball in local store later.
4,okay,"My austic nephew loves this item. However, the blub blew soon after buying and the color tiles fell out. Some crazy glue and some cheap blubs it works great"
1,Cheap.,Put together very poorly. Also this item came damaged. The box was way too big for the item and not much packing and it had too much room to move around in shipping. I sent the item back.
2,Great Idea but......,"I'm glad somebody chose to write a book on this topic. However, the solutions offered are too simplistic."
1,not up to par,"Because there are so many yoga videos on the market, this one just doesn't cut it. The set could have been done in someones basement, and it looks like the actors had one run through before they filmed it. At times the routine is simple, but at a few times, they do very advance positions. Also, The guy in charge doesn't explain which sex muscles the positions are building, which is kinda why you are watching this in the first place. Overall, this is a yoga tape not quite for beginners or advanced."
5,Gain insight,"As a young man I have often thought about being a high school teacher. This book really explores the life of a teacher and of a person who cares about the students. I really gained a lot of insight into what challenges and rewards some teachers in public schools must face. This book also educated me as to what personal qualities and beliefs an effective teacher may wish to have to survive and enjoy the profession. Halpin's writing style is fresh, to the point, witty, and very human. I am twenty something and totally enjoyed his realness and humor. He really cares about the students and is an honorable man. He was a joy to get to know. Stay strong"
4,The possibilities....,"The broadband adpater for the NCG is ok for what ot does. Some of your downs include: * Not being able to 'surf the net'(come even the ""old"" dreamcast could do this!)and limited online features. * Minimal availability, not enough for sale, a stupid concept, really.... just like what Sony did with their network adapter. just to cause a big sudden comotion of everyone trying to get their hands on one.* but other than that, Nintendo themselves, have done a decent job, but could come out with a disc, and keyboard/mouse adapter, that could either fit into the Hi speed port, or Serial Port 2. I mean.. the adapter is so cool. And so many more possibilities are right in front of us. Just making it for online game play, that's a little lame. Atleast look what X-Box and Sony are doing with their's! All of this gets that broadband adapter a 4/5 rating.-Adam (15 San Diego)"
3,"VERY small, but affordable","An average product, I think there are better portable TVs out there. This one is extremely tiny, the screen is only about 2.5 inches. If you have poor eyesight, you definitely wouldn't want to purchase this product.It does get decent reception for me, and the batteries (if you use good ones) last for about 3 hours. It has the option to use headphones with it and the sound is decent. It comes with a stand, which is useful for standing it up on a table or countertop.I would recommend researching other portable TVs before purchasing this one. While the price is nice, it is smaller than expected. The price is affordable though, so it might be just what you're looking for if you have decent vision and want something that is VERY portable."
2,"Ugh, hated the story -but good acting","The acting was good-the story was not. It was depressing, strange, and uninteresting. I like dpressing and strange, but not when it's combined with a bad story. I think some people might enjoy it in their own way-I just can't recommend it though. The stars are for the acting."
1,Awful,"I found this film to be one of the most baffling and off-putting pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The beginning is intriguing enough, as Morvern discovers her dead boyfriend and decides to go on living in their apartment with his corpse in plain view. She reads a note he leaves for her on his computer, along with a manuscript of a novel of his. The movie could go in a multitude of directions after this, but this character sucks the life out of the movie. I had trouble staying awake and keeping my sanity during viewing it. And funnily enough, this seemed exactly like the kind of movie I would usually go for--quirky, independent, different. The problem seems to be that the director attempts to show us how Morvern becomes unhinged and lost after her boyfriend's suicide, but the movie itself becomes meaningless and without an anchor or any grounding. It too is lost.Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague."
2,Why the fuss?,"This film is definitely not a masterpiece. I found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly over-rated. Yes, the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak. To make matters worse, the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere. Perhaps I missed something gigantic because I was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but I would not attempt to see it again. However, there were a couple of memorable scenes.I would strongly advise renting it before purchase. Some people do love the film but I don't understand why."
2,oh my god! what a let down,"What was up with the gratuitous nude scenes? I saw that woman's private parts in that film more than I see my own in a week! The editing was terrible and the story does not resolve itself. The concept was great but you must get through a bunch of out of context nudity, drunken lolligagging, etc before the real story starts twenty minutes before the end of the film! A waste!"
3,OK for camera but not much else,"The Tamrac Express 8 camera bag is well made and does not look like a typical camera bag, that was the reason I bought it. We are going on a long trip this summer and I thought a combo camera bag/small pack would fit the bill. The camera part is quite enough for my needs (Nikon D40 plus 2 lenses) but the backpack is disappointingly small. You could maybe jam a jacket and a small lunch in the upper compartment but not much else. If you were thinking of using this as a carry on and wanted to add a book or magazine and a water bottle you would be hard pressed to fit it all in, especially a magazine or newspaper, there simply is no good place to put it."
4,Great Pack,"I got this bag for my Canon Rebel XTi. I like the fact that the bag doesn't look like a camera bag. I don't want to advertise what I have. I also like that having a backpack allows my hands to be free. This is really helpful if you have children. The bag easily holds my camera and a lens with accessories. I think I could fit another lens and a small flash. The top section is very small and I am a little nervous about putting much in it anyway. If you put anything of any weight, it would be setting on your camera. You can easily store your keys and a wallet, however, which is all I really need. I also have to mention that my husband thinks the backpack looks really feminine, like one of those backpack purses, mainly because it is pretty small."
5,RiCks,El cable es demasiado bueno para el que lo quiera comprar solo good ! sirve demasiado bien genial ya no tengo q usar CD's y full parranada ! :))))
3,Not what I was looking for (but may be for you?),"I bought this along with a pioneer 3100ub cd player. My plan was to mostly be using my ipod for music. I thought that maybe because my head unit had a ""ipbus"" connection, I could attach this in the back stealthly and use the USB on the front for other media. Apparently ""ipbus"" (head unit) is not ""ibus"" (cable) and this cable did not work with my head unit. I actually figured it out hours after I ordered the pair just by looking at the two connections, but it was too late to turn back...Moral of the story: This cable will not work with the pioneer deh p3100ub.I bet it works great with the head units it was made for. I hope this clears up some stuff for others out there who were in my same boat.I gave it three stars because I figure I need to give it a rating to post this but I'm not actually sure if its good or not! I hope this post wasn't jibberish and I actually know what I'm talking about! Take care."
3,Not what i wanted. but still amazing,"This is exactly what was purchased. Though it wasnt compatible with my stereo, the cord is very sturdy and seems like a right match for what it is supposed to do. So before buying this product, check many times in many places to see if this is compatible with your radio. i ended up buying a different cord because replacing the stereo wouldve been very expensive ($80-$500+), I have nothing bad to say so dont take my word for it. just be very cautious."
5,AWESOME Book!!!!!,"This is probably the 5th book I have read on trading, and it is by far the most informative book I have read yet."
5,Book is WELL WORTH THE READ!,"Why would anyone take the time to write a review on a book they have never bought or even listen to them as the previous writer stated? How idiotic is that. You have way too much time on your hands. I have read the book. It is very insightful, and well worth the money for $69.00. Sounds like the previous writer has a bad case of not listening to calls Waxie or Tiny and the other staff make or he would not say he isn't making money. Go write your own book if you are so knowledgable. Oh well that is his problem that I won't make mine. Learning the 10 AM rule is some of the best advice there is. Learning how to manage your money and the trends is where Michael is miles ahead of others. Kudos to the book, and highly recommend! Well worth the read."
1,A little common sense please,"If Mr. Parness can turn $33,000 into more than seven million dollars in less than three years then why would he waste his time selling books at $69.00 each rather than simply keep on day trade using what he claims to be tried and true trading techniques?All Mr. Parness would need to do is take his seven million dollars and keep trading and according to his claim he should be able to make 212% on his money in three years and have $14,840,000.Buyer Beware."
4,decent pocket dictionary,"As with all Langenscheidt dictionaries, this one is good. It's easy to use, durable, and reflects accurate modern usage (as far as I can tell). This one in particular, however, is on the lean side. Compared to the pocket German-English dictionary this seems to have far fewer entries and isn't even suitable for a first-year student of Turkish.Great for vacation, not as great for the classroom. So go ahead and get this to carry around, but look for a larger desk reference to back it up."
4,Breathtaking Footage Of Spiritual Iran,"This video is shot entirely on location in various parts of Iran. Almost the entire footage is taken in spiritual locations. The cover of the video states ""an eye-opening pilgrimage to spiritual enlightenment."" The video reveals spiritual rites and rituals hidden for centuries. There is some fantastic footage of spiritual music and dance in a ritual that lasts for hours."
1,"GOOD FOOTAGE, SHAME ABOUT THE SCRIPT","This is a complete waste of money if you want to use it for teaching purposes, as I had wanted to. Some of the footage of remote parts of beautiful Iran is breathtaking, but even the narrator's attractive voice cannot compensate for such an appallingly ill-informed and self-indulgent script. Beware! This is not the work of a serious scholar or mystic of any kind, but a self-indulgent director who takes herself far too seriously. If you can find a way of removing the narration, and simply using the footage, then that could be useful. Otherwise it would be far too damaging for serious college-level students, and is more likely to make them cringe or laugh than learn. Very poor, apart from the camera work, which is wasted on the script. They should make a new version with most of the same footage but a new and intelligent script."
1,Beware - Sufism for Tourists,"I agree with the review of Umm Zaid below. I practise and studyerfan (sufism). Personally I find the portrayals of Sufi practise from this film verging on the offensive.Reviewer: Umm Zaid (NY, NY) - See all my reviewsCringe worthy view of tasawwuf (""Islamic mysticism,"" Sufism) in Iran. Sensationalistic and exploitative, especially when it comes to the portrayal of the female dervishes, with the same tired errors and misunderstandings one finds in any mediocre Orientalist work on the topic. Anyone wanting to see the face of the Qadiri tariqa (the one featured in most of the film) would be much better off reading English translations of the works of Sheikh Abdal Qadir al Jilani."
4,Miracles do happen,"Joseph Prince mentioned this book on one of his television broadcasts. I found the book to be a powerful revelation how God sends people to the darkest of places to shed light to those who are in need. Jackie Pullinger is amazing. She stood in faith, prayed in the Spirit, and changed lives radically!Where the light shines, darkness will flee! Praise God"
5,"How does God lead and how to be led by God, today?","My burning questions has been: In today's life, how does God lead a Christian individual? and what does one need to do to be led by God? The stories in Bible were not enough for me and i had longed to hear some testimonies from today's life. Then i found this book and I think it did a very awesome job in answering those two questions, through the life of Jackie Pullinger."
2,"Does what it's supposed to do, but stains my seats","I use these covers to protect my seats because my clothes can get dirty during my work. They do a pretty good job of staying in place and covering the seats when driving. That's why I gave it two stars. The problem is, they have ink labels on the plastic that rubbed off onto my light-colored leather seat and gave it some black stains after I used 20-25 covers. I was able to get most of the stains out but some I couldn't. I hope it will come out. Perhaps I was not using them properly, but I haven't used them in hot weather so the ink didn't melt, and I don't know what else would cause them to stain. But there should be some sort of warning on the box. I only used them once in a car with cloth seats and there didn't appear to be any problems other than it not staying in place as well, but beware if you are buying these for leather seats."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"This little TV was great for the first couple of days, then it just stopped working. Tried different batteries, tried an adapter, nothing, it just quit and refuses to work.DO NOT BUY! I wish I hadn't!"
3,harley plate,item did not seem to be made with the same quality that other harley items previously purchased and fear that it will not hold up well to the outside weather elements
4,Magi Nation,"This is a pretty good strategy guide, but those who got it for the GBC game, beware. Over half of it consists of card game strategies, but it still is pretty good."
3,China Bayles on retreat?,"In Rueful Death, China finds herself involuntarily and unwittingly tricked into using her amateau detective skills. China has decided to take a two-week retreat at St. T's convent in order to wind down from the busy holidays. While there, she is asked to look into a series of fires. This book is different from Albert's others in such that you don't really want to choose a suspect, because who wants to think that a nun, or anybody working at a convent, is behind all the trouble? China also happens to run into a hunky ex-beau that she knew from her lawyer days. China doesn't get much rest on this retreat, but she does catch the firebug. Pretty much par for course in this series."
5,cute movies,"great disney movies for kids! nice box set includes the santa clause 1, 2, and 3 in blu ray, good for gift"
5,Love them,I love the Santa Clause trilogy. I even think the third one was fun. The blu-ray quality is great and worth the money.
5,"expensive, but worth it","These blades last a long time, they're really sharp and stay that way even after 5+ uses.If you're a barber you might want to use something like the Dovo shavette since you'd be throwing out blades all the time, and Derby's blades are $5 for 100"
5,"Surprise, Surprise Ending","There are a large number of ebooks available for free in the public domain. This is one of many by Honore de Balzac as part of La Com√©die humaine. Great translation from the original French. If you want to undertake reading some of these classics, this is a great choice. I suggest you look up Balzac on Wikipedia to help choose which of his books you want to read and in what order. The book makes more sense as part of a Trilogy The Thirteen. Read them in order. This is the third. The ending is both timely and unexpected. Enjoy."
1,ripped off by this company,"Do not buy this product!!! You will be buying a sprayfoam filled handle superglued to a unique designed hammer head. I have purchased one hammer that lasted long enough to frame two houses, then the nose fell off. I recieved a replacement which lasted another few months until the handle snapped off. The company now refuses to send me a replacement hammer so I am out the 189.00 I payed for it. This tool is for looking at- not using. Hands down the worst investment I have made in my toolbox. Do not buy this!"
2,Need your help,"I recieve the book call "" A Correct Key to the Entered Apprentice Fellow Craft and Master Mason Degrees "" but it has a code key to help you read the book and i never recieve it. With out the code key the book is useless to read.If you can send me the code key i would appreciate it. Thank you"
2,Don't make them like they used to.,I understand this is a inexpensive phone but it still isn't built very well. What I wanted was to replace a phone from 1960 with another corded phone. This phone just does not even come close to the quality.I'm too lazy to review this properly. Phone handset doesn't weigh enough to look good hung up. Ring sounds lame.
2,"typical ""imported"" phone","I needed to replace my kitchen wall phone, which I very rarely use, only if I need a secure line. So when my old AT&T phone died I went to Radio Shack and their prices were too high for what I needed. I saw the Scitec phone and the price seemed like the best I was going to get(I also had to settle for black). Well the old adage, you get what you pay for certainly applies in this case. When I took it out of the box, there was a screw inside the phone floating around. I had to shake the phone for several minutes to remove this errant screw. Then when I was trying to affix it to the wall plate, it never seemed secure. It is a dissapointment but I got free shipping and maybe I'll get a year or two out of it, then replace it with the better model at radio shack. But there is a bonus, whenever someone ends a call on my cordless phones, the kitchen phone will give one ring!"
2,Cute but not practical,"This ""Tea Cattle"" is absolutely adorable. It is not practical for daily use. The spout doesn't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove. The lid doesn't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move."
2,Leaky Cow,"I have the same problem as Sillygal00 - ""The spout doesn't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove!"". I'm returning it."
2,Only because it's cute,"I received this kettle as a Christmas gift a couple years ago, and I was thrilled because I love cows. But in use, it's really not practical. The whistle never seemed to work right, and, like so many before me have already said, it pours unevenly. I scalded my foot with it. :(I only give it two stars because it's so darn cute."
3,"More of a ""Reference"" than a ""Primer""","I don't like to give any book a low-rated review (see my other reviews). However, this one deserved that. Despited its name, this book only contain short-lists of each container, algorithm, and other things else in the STL. This is, in fact, not a ""Primer"". For this kind of book, isn't we called it a ""Reference""?The examples in the book are good for showing the readers ""how to use the whatever it refered to"". However that's all they did. I think it would have been better if some of Real-World examples had been included (like those in Lippman's masterpiece C++ Primer, or Prata's C++ Primer Plus).So.. why do I still give it 3 stars?Well it still can be use as a reference when I need to look for something (because its size is quite small...), and I'm not connect on the net...(I found Dinkumware's on-line C/C++ Reference to be very similiar to this one)."

2,Too Short,"These stories were too short for you to get involved with the characters. They also are not new stories, I had previously read the Diana Palmer stories but when I purchased the book I assumed they were all new. I think for a person to get to know the characters and care about them the writers definately need to be able to write longer stories."
3,Strength and Weakness,"Robinson's book is truly a memoir, and I find this to be both a strength and a weakness. It gives the book strength because it is a complete personal account. Every piece of information is direct from not only a first hand observer, but moreover a participant. However it weakens the book because at points too much information was detailed. Especially information about already well documented events."
2,Can't adjust angle of tray,The tray does not sit flat and over the last few months has changed increased the angle (towards the back) so that it is almost impossible to use. It can't be adjusted to and tilts upwards so that you have to prop up the keyboard in the back and the mouse slides right off the back of the mouse tray. There is NO way to adjust the angle and hence is really a waste of money.
5,clear again,"I removed a TV from the splitter and noticed more static, I plopped one of these on and it was clear again."
3,"Mixed Bag of ""Terminators""",I probably would not have been dissapointed with these if it weren't for the fact that I received a couple terminators of much higher quality than the rest. This tells me that more than likely they are selling the caps off of splitter's that were used in install jobs somewhere.All in all they work but I would like to have had them all be of the same quality (Preferably the higher one).
3,THEY LOOK GOOD,I BOUGHT THESE TO USE AT A LATER DATE. THEY LOOK GREAT. IF THEY WORK AS WELL AS THEY LOOK ALL IS WELL.
4,"Finally, something new...","Ms. Hilden's book struck a chord in me I thought unreachable. Though darkly disturbing, I can't help but to think the whole story beautiful. I cried 15 minutes straight before finishing the book. 3 is a must read for anyone who ever thought they were in love."
3,Free Cell hand held game,"Free Cell Hand Held Game: Unlike another version of this game, this version does not recognize that no more moves are possible when a card is movable back and forth, and therefore, the replay button will not work. You are forced to begin a new game instead. The best thing about Free Cell is that EVERY GAME is WINNABLE. You can REPLAY the same game until you figure out how to win it."
3,Pretty good initial effort!,"This band is getting alot of acclaim overseas, and are embarking on a European tour with one of the greatest power metal bands, Masterplan! Basically, that's why I even explored the band. On my first listen, I was far from being floored! The best way I can describe this band's sound is that it's a mixture of Soundgarden, Godsmack, and Creed. Yep, that pretty much wraps it up! Pure Inc. definitley isn't breaking any new ground here. It's an ok listen, but it's not going to go down as a metal must own! The lead singer has potential, but a Ray Gillen or Jorn Lande he'll never be!"
3,"Basic Mathematics Primer, Lacking in Lively Context","This book read as if Paulos began with a list of common mathematical fallacies and went looking for archetypal examples of them. In many places he doesn't even use specific examples, instead describing a type of story without referring to any particular ones. I really missed the sense that he was reacting to real articles; it seemed more like he was contriving neatly exemplary, and hermetically sealed, examples.Paulos should have concentrated on a collection of the newspapers that went out on a given day, or on a single paper over time. That way he could have stumbled across some of the more muddled and spontaneous uses of number in the news, and his math primer reactions could have been less pat.Ultimately this book failed to surprise me with anything. It was pleasant, but not delightful."
3,So so in the World of Apple,"Just purchased this pretty thing, and it's turned out to be tougher to switch from my PC to this... purchased as a second computer, and it's refreshingly compatible with our printer/cable connection etc but ALL of our Software is PC only and that Virtual PC program is quite pricey. It's much easier to use than a PC, but it's almost simple to the point of being catered to the stupid crowd. *Needs mental challenges*Again, on the pretty side, but definitely not as intelligent as my twice-the-price Dell."
1,Triumph of advertising over engineering,"Poor performance at twice the price. How does Apple do it? Get a good ad company, by five year old G3 from Motorolla for the price of a DVD or two. Contract a company in Taiwan to build the computer and then sell it for 3-4x the cost. PT Barnum was right. There's one born everyday."
3,Predictable,"This book was a predictable,easy read. The stereotypes were annoying and it rally makes me wonder if the author knows anything about Hollywood. I found the son to be an unbelievable character, he acted more like a 5 or 6 year old. And can someone please tell me where to find a teenage daughter who doesn't rebel a nd mouth off?in the end I give it 3 stars because it was still so much better than Winter Garden."
3,Not as good....,"I love Kristin Hannah...she is an awesome writer and tells such wonderful stories. However, this one I didn't like as much as most of her books. Not that was a a good book by any means...I just didn't like the story as much as I have liked many of her other books. It's still a great read."
1,NOT SATISFIED,Was listed as free shipping w/orders over $25 & I WAS BILLED FOR SHIPPING!!!! NOT SATISFIED!!!
2,Boring,This story reads as if the author hammered it out in just a few days. Very light on substance--difficult to keep reading to the end.
1,Major Disapointment,"After all the hype I read on some of the internet boards about this book I was really looking forward to reading it. I thought it started out fine but I really came to dislike the fact that Mikala kept such a major secrets from Liam throughout their entire marrage. I felt she was an extremely shelfish and cold person.I could never get back into the story since while I felt sorry for the children, I was hoping she would give Liam a break."
2,Not what I expect from Jill Shalvis,"This one was ok - but not what I've come to expect from Jill Shalvis. Her Sky High Air books, and the newest one Instant Attraction, are much much better."
1,Oh Please,I found this story very boring. How many times can you get off and say stop? This book is just a trivial get no where fast story. There is no substance. It is not worth your money. Write your own story. You could do better than this one!
4,"TOTALY TWISTED, I LOVED IT","Bloody, gory mayhem. A great gore movie with some totaly outrageus scenes. See the part with the head and the girl tied to the table. A must see for horror buffs."
3,A bloody head on a platter.,"A bloody, talking head on a platter, comedy, brief nudity, and gore. What more can you ask for? Make sure dinner was at least 3 hours ago. Outrageous ending. Enjoy!"
4,The End,"Its amazing film but the end (the last quarter of the film)could be better than that,I did not like the act of that dead Dr who lusted after that girl,its hard to convince,also when he mentally dominated the other professor and controled him"
4,Re-Animator,"Re-Animator is one of the most gruesome horror movies of the 1980's. Based on a short story by H.P. Lovecraft, Re-Animator contains all of the essential attributes of a great horror movie. Zombies, severed heads, science experiments, and excessive gore make this an over the top movie; one that went far beyond anything created before it."
2,Unbelievably Goofy.,"I was expecting something totally different than this. All this film contains are talking heads a lot of crazy people yelling and some bad acting. I mean I wasn't expecting much from this in the first place, but still I was disappointed to even get less than I was expecting. I wish that only the good films would get the 2-disc treatment and not stupid cult films that I could have made in my basement. I can't wait to see what the sequels have in store for me, I guess you'll be seeing another review from me on those too (Hint: probably not a positive one). If you liked this then see the Howling movies, you'll be happy."
5,cult classic,"One of my favorite horror films. If you've seen it, you should want to own it. If you haven't seen it, you should. In the same vein as Return of the Living Dead, the film mixes horror and comedy seamlessly, and never drags. I highly recommend it."
4,A great classic,"Ever since my husband watched this movie years ago, he got hooked on it. It's one of the classic Sci-Fi Zombie movies he finds worth re-visiting and watching, again and again. If you're a Sci-Fi, Zombie, Horror movie watcher, then this is the movie for you."
3,Horror Classic Only So-So,"Evil Dead II has spoiled me forever. The horror in this is a bit over the top, the special effects are, well, effective when they aren't a little funny (okay, so the cat was really scary when I was a kid, but less than compelling as an adult), and the acting is, well, bad. A low-budget classic? Yes. A must-see of cult cinema. Of course! A film you must own so you can watch it again and again? No. Catch it at a party, a midnight movie, with a bunch of friends at midnight before you start a really creepy movie like The Thing or even The House on Haunted Hill, but I wouldn't bother to buy it."
2,This book only helps you to lose less,"This book basicly repeats the essence in Blackjack for the Clueless. The research in this book is unscientific, as the author himself said. Through my own research, I found that his method only helps me not to lose too much, but not winning."
4,Emotionally Charged,A wonderfully crafted story which expertly captures its character's emotions so well that almost any reader can identify with them.You'll want to read the entire series!
2,Disappointing Read,"If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go. Frankly, I was disappointed. After my book club read ""Ain't Nobody's Business"" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries. However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original. I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though."
2,"Troma Rules, but this ones a miss","I love Troma as a film studio and I enjoy a lot of their other films, yet this ones a miss. Its about a woman who turns into a pterodactyl. and thats it. its mildly entertaining, but not up to Troma standards. the funniest thing in the movie is Salvatore Dali, an indian cheif with an attitude."
2,"Sometimes ok, often frustrating","I've had this card for about a year in my MacBook Pro. Here are my observations.First, the good: it fits in the slot just fine, it doesn't require anything special to operate, it doesn't cause any issues outside of itself. It works fine with my 1 and 2 GB SD and XD cards.The bad, though: XD cards are a tight fit. Inserting or removing an XD card while the reader is in the MacBook is tough -- it will often cause the reader to come out of the slot. Not a big deal, more of an annoyance. It will not recognize my 16 GB SD card. This severly undermines the utility of the reader. What's the point of keeping this one if I have to have one for my bigger cards?"
1,Only Bad Pet Owners Would keep their pet tied out in a open bed,"This product is for the most irrisponsible of dog owners.The Kind of people that should not own a dog or any animal at all.You should never keep your pet in the open bed of a truck, espically tied to the middle of the truck by their collar.Be responsible, get a crate secure the crate, put the dog in the crate."
3,Revere Copper Clad Sauce Pan,I have used Revere copper clad sauce pans for over 30 years and they have stood up to being left on a heating element after the food had burned. The earlier pans were made in America. This new pan has a thinner wall and a much thinner bottom. The copper clad is thinner. I doubt it could sustain being left on a heating element too long without being damaged. On the plus side it does heat up one cup of water approximately one minute faster than the older pan.
2,Not the same traditional Revere quality as the rest of my Revere pots,Not the same traditional Revere quality as the rest of my Revere pots. These are made in Indonesia to the old USA specs but somehow the finishing is not as good as traditional product. I returned my purchase.
2,Copper wore off,"I got a set of these as a wedding present years ago. The copper wore off after a few months. Maybe I washed them wrong, I'm not sure. They still work as regular sauce pans, but they seem over priced if you are paying for the copper bottom."
2,Not Good!,This pan is not good quality. It is much lighter than the olds ones that were made in the USA! This is made in Indo-China and that should explain it all. Too bad that a product named after an American Patriot left the US to save money.
3,It's ok,"It's a good hat but it doesn't heat in the back, it's ok on the sides and on top of my head."
2,Very nice when it is working,"I just wrote this review for almost the exact same notebook as this one:I really enjoy my iBook when it works. I not very computer savy and it is perfect for a novice like me. My main complaint is that I have had to send it back twice for repairs. The first time the screen died. I mean just died. I turned it on, heard a pop, and that was it. Sending it back wasn't much trouble, but by the time I got it back about three weeks had passed. Then it stop booting and made a funny grinding noise. They sent me a new hard drive (quickly this time) but that didn't do the trick. I just sent the whole thing back and I haven't got it back yet. So I love it, but I really wish it was more reliable."
2,Did not state that it does NOT support Infolithium...,The battery seems charged but it's next to useless in a Sony CamCorder because it does NOT support InfoLithium. It will charge probably until it explodes and the camera detects it as discharged and constantly displays the battery warning on the screen.
2,Did I Get A Bad One?,I bought this saw based on Milwaukee's reputation and the satisfaction I have had with their electric tools. This recip saw is no comparison to my DeWalt. It has no battery life and seems to lack the power of the DeWalt. Even when fully charged it seems to struggle through the work piece. Possibly a bad battery because I'm sure that Milwaukee would not intentionaly produce something which posesses the lack of quality as displayed in my saw.
4,The Civil War State By State,"I purchased this book for my father for Christmas 2011. From what I have heard from him, it is a VERY GOOD book. He liked reading it and seeing the old civil war photos in the book."
5,A great edition to any double reed player's library!!,"Tom Stacy is one of the foremost English Hornist of our time.He has more than 50 solo performances with the New york Philharmonic, and other major orchestras around the country.This CD shows both Tom's technical mastery of the instrument, and his sensitive musicality. The CD also demonstrates three comtemporary composers at there best."
2,Doesn't live up - Ruined the series for me,"It took half the season to finally get interesting and the season finale... I wish I hadn't watched. I've been a really big fan of the Dexter series and have been recommending it to friends and family for years, but this season was a total disappointment. If you like Dexter, do yourself a favor and watch the first three seasons over again (well worth the time) but skip season 4."
5,Dexter!!,Love love love this season! John Lithgow was ah-mazing in this season to the very end! This season has a very shocking end but it was spoiled for me before I even got to see it. But it was still a very good ending nonetheless.
4,"Until the finale, I loved this season.","Yes, the rumors are true: John Lithgow is amazing as the main villian in this season. The biggest dissapointment to me was the conclusion, everything leading up to it though was amazing, but the finale (for the first time for me) was a letdown. The image in the finale was pretty upsetting too, I won't say anymore for those who haven't seen it yet. All that side, the acting was incredible, who could imagine JL as a cold-blooded killer? Well, anyone see Cliffhanger? Obviously, he had alot more development in this, and better script."
4,;0),"this season was really engaging that think Dexter has grown alot and now with a family he has to learn how to balancing work, family and is work on the side. I love the bad guy in this season I think they did a good job and he did give Dexter a little challenged. Didnt like the way it ended but i guess thats the way it is. Towards of the end of the last episode i kept saying No, No No No."
4,The End .. NOT the End !,"I have given this fourth series 4 stars but in truth some editions deserved 5, others 2.Unfortunately, to make the plot work we are asked to believe a number of things that are very unlikely, and also accept just too many co-incidences. The middle of the season is not good, the on-going main plot protracted, and we see a 'weak' Dexter which is not, I believe, the programme's strength.Without giving away plot lines, I have to sum it up by saying that the season's last edition made me believe it was 'all over'. I was amazed there is a FIFTH season ~ and fear it may stretch my disbelief even further.But despite all this, Michael C. Hall, is serving up some of the best television with a show that still manages to shock !"
5,Dexter is amazing. Deb Morgan and Rita? Not so much.,I love Dexter. It's become my favorite show. Even though I hate Rita and Deb Morgan is the most annoying on the show. I think I don't like her because the actress that plays her is not very good. This is definitely the best Dexter season so far. And he has a awesome adivisary in Lithgow. Lithgow is simply amazing in this show. Although the season gets sidetracked with silly relationships of the supporting cast. It's still pretty bloody. Warning though. The first couple episodes are exhausting to watch.
2,"First Breaking Bad, now Dexter :(","worst season, especially the first half of the season. lithgow was no big deal, the directing bad, writing was dumb with stupid connections and lame scripts for the actors, a lot with dexter and his in mind thoughts. seasons 1 thru 3 are great. i dont get how people can be so wrong sometimes, best season yet? no way. The best thing they can do to come back from this so so season is to have dexter snap and go on a whole season killing spree, no code. then of course goes back to the code and being good. i can go on and on about how bad the first half of the season was and how so so the second half was, but it should be common sense."
3,Place Products Elsewhere,"Seriously, the close ups of cars, Apple, Red Bull and Sugar in the Raw of all things ? I will never buy those products , it has the opposite effect on me. If you want a good example of product placement, see The Sopranos. I could never tell if there was product placement in the show or if the items were just in the background. Subtlety is key, don't center your shots around the damn thing.I watch shows like Dexter to escape the type of stress that comes from having a corporate phallus stuck in my brain, not to fellate it. Showtime obviously doesn't respect you or I; if they did ,their programming wouldn't be rife with shill-jobs. You'd think with all that extra money they could hire writers who could cobble together a show with some semblance of its former self.I'm still a fan, but I'm holding on by a wire, and considering how frequently they make me pay for their show by putting up with their adverts, I will never again a nickle their way thrust."
1,Horrible!,I expect Amazon to make sure their products that are purchased new are NOT defective. This dvd was skipping at the first and second scenes. Worst purchase ever!
4,Dexter - entertaining dark comedy,"Dexter's writers continue to explore Dexter's psyche as he struggles to balance a life in 'the real world' with his darkness. Surprising, entertaining - it' rains on our too see list!"
3,Be Certain This is the Right USB,"I ordered this and had to return it, as it was the wrong ""mini"" USB.There's also a more-mini USB, which some cell phones and devices are shipping with now. The connector is a few mm smaller than the older mini USBs that have been around for years.Amazon happily accepted my return, but it could have been avoided if this product showed a close-up of the connector."
3,More of same,"Subotnick has always been on the cutting edge of electronic music, but the works on this disc seem a little bit old-hat; KEY TO SONGS presents the same sort of material, and holds the attention a lot better. If you can't get enough Subotnick, this will do; otherwise, save your money for the eventual CD release of the early classics, SIDEWINDER and UNTIL SPRING (we can always hope...)"
1,one of the worst movies ever made!,What a stinker. I fully understand why it went almost immediately to video-PPPPeeeee UUUUuuuuuuu!
3,Fun family movie,Very funny! Good movie for kids about being different and learning to like what makes you special. Also the need to come together as a team to accomplish a goal can create a bond among team members.
3,"Good content, BAD typographic job","I have recently received this book as a gift. The content is GREAT but the format of the book LACKS A LOT in quality. That is, because there are over 1100 pages and because somebody had the unfortunate idea to place 16 color drawings on thick glossy paper in the middle, my long awaited book got ruined (read broke in two pieces, right in the middle). That was the WORST typographic job I have ever seen. All thanks to SYBEX Inc. who have edited this book. Hey guys, couldn't you make two volumes?"
4,Decent tent for the size and weight,"I used this tent for one week in Abisko Sweden above the arctic circle. The tent is light and easy to set up and also kept the rain out well. But as with almost all tents the vent in the top isn't enough to vent out the condensation from breathing at night. I don't think that's avoidable though. One thing about this tent though is that it really suffered in the wind. The rain fly allows the wind to blow right through the tent, I wish it came closer to the ground or something to prevent this. I just suggest doing your best in trying to face the wind feet first so that the air flows over the tent instead of through. Also I brought only a 60 litre pack with me and there was barely room for that in the tent which was slightly annoying but tolerable. Besides those quibbles this tent did me well. But I'd be interested to see how it does in the cold as it was warm, about 13-14 degrees celcius."
3,Smells great and kills ants but has not worked yet on our dog's fleas,"This product came well recommended from other reviewers, but it has not rid our poor dog of fleas yet. He is still just as plagued by them as he was before we washed him with this. It does, however, kill ants when we spray them on the counter so that is a plus. We're going to bathe the dog again to give it another try, using the refresher more this time around. Will report back on how that works."
5,Wonderful book.,"This book is extremely witty. I had to chuckle over some of the little entries several times. The artwork is spectacular and the actual feel of the book is amazing. It has a kind of puffy soft cover that is very pleasant to touch. I have used this book many times with children during writing lessons, although some of the wit escapes them, but they are still interested in it because of the pictures so the book can be used with young people, especially if you are willing to explain some of the language to them."
3,just a student,"This was the textbook I used last year for social studies. We got new textbooks this year, which I don't think have as much information as the old ones. In any case, aside from the controversey about religion in this book, it's pretty good and informative.However, it does kind of lean towards Islam. I don't have anything against Islam (though personally I think the government is trying to feed us propaganda), but there is just so much about Islam in here, more than about the other religions. I suppose that, yes, it was an empire, but there were other empires that weren't taught in nearly the same way. I found that most mentions of Christianity were related to its corruption, such as the Crusades and the iniquisition.Other than that, it was a fairly good book, but could be better."
1,Outraged,"I find this book to be an outrage to any United States citizen that beleives in ""One nation under God."" It's already illegal to teach Christianity in our public schools, illegal to pray and now our schools want to use this book to teach the children how to pray to Allah when our country's founding forefathers knew that the only way to the Father is through the Son, Jesus Christ. Abraham Lincoln would be rolling in his grave if he only knew!"
4,"Handy, Stable Kickstand","Most people would never put a kickstand on their bike and I agree with them. But on a touring/commuter bike they are VERY handy! I have a Trek 520 and my wife has a Surly LHT and we both have this kickstand. Not only is it nice to not have to lay your bike on the ground if there isn't something handy to lean it against, but, if you ride loaded with panniers and such, this little item actually works as a bike stand so you can fix flats and such without completely unloading the bike and flipping it upside down!It has a load limit of 25 Kilos I believe and that is way light for a touring bike, heck I can put 25 Kilos on my front rack alone! But even though it is a bit wobbly with 40 - 60 kg on the bike they held up. They are not as heavy as they could be but this is not and item you are going to be putting on a 10 lb racing bike!Very Handy item if you need one!"
1,Stant 12270 30 Pound Cooling System And Pressure Cap Tester,"Device arrived as expected. I used it the first time, on my car, and it worked as expected however I used it the second time about 2 minutes later and it failed at half it's rated capacity. Being an excellent mechanic I disassembled the device and corrected the flaw. I'm none too satisfied with the as sold condition of the device. Seems like the seller had an issue with the device and promptly sold it rather than fix it properly or return it to the manufacturer for replacement. Fortunately I have repaired the device and it now works properly. Were it not for my own mechanical ability this device would have been utterly useless."
4,"A concise, but thorough discussion of major MBA topics.","If you are looking to gain a perspective on ideals taught in major MBA schools across the nation, you would benefit from reading this book. I am a senior finance major at the University of Texas at Austin, and I have found the readings informative and refreshing. I have given a copy to several fellow employees that have had no formal business education and they have commented on how enlightening it has been."
5,Portable MBA Libraries,An excellent resource for anything to do with business. I never leave home without it...
5,Amazing book on meditation and the mind,"This is definitely one of the best books on meditation and working with the mind that I've encountered. Written with such clarity, Mingyur Rinpoche makes some of the most complex concepts in Buddhist thought, as well as neuroscience and quantum physics accessible to the average person. The practical meditation techniques are excellent and easily applicable to daily life. Highly recommended."
5,Clear and compassionate assistance rooted in the real,"A real jewel of love, encouragement, and support. I am very grateful that Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche has made these wisdom teachings so readily available. This deftly and succinctly written text can help you gently and confidently guide yourself in the exploration of how things are, gaining understanding of yourself and the context of life. His friendly, level-headed, non-dogmatic style, along with the wealth of straightforward, pragmatic experiential knowledge he shares in approaching and supporting this practice of discovery, can help you defuse and avoid time-consuming entanglements while establishing and nurturing a healthy voyage of existential inquiry."
4,"Clear, but weak bass response","I replaced the rear stock speakers in an older Honda Accord. I had already upgraded the fronts to an older version of this Pioneer speaker. The bass response now seems clearer, but maybe weaker than the old stock speakers. The highs and mids improved substantially."
5,"Awesome show, awesome price!","I love It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but didn't start watching it on TV until later in the series. This package is a great way to get all of the previous seasons (and Christmas special) at a great price. Each season is individually packaged (like you would buy in the store) and come in a cardboard box that looks like a six pack. I've watched through most of the episodes at this point and absolutely love it, definitely worth the money!"
4,Love it. Always a riot,"I love this show. Raunchy, riotous and ridiculous, Its always sunny in Philadelphia has it all. Following the misadventures of bar owner Frank Reynolds (played by Danny Devito) and his merry band of miscreant employees get into all sorts of trouble, most of which is deserved. Most akin to the Seinfeld cast, (if the cast were a bunch of drug-abusing, alcoholic idiots). You will laugh until you piss your pants, then you'll laugh some more. A great buy, and a great way to get all the seasons of Sunny at once."
5,TRUE ECW ONE NIGHT STAND MATCHES,"Matches that most likely will happen:1] Dean Malenko vs. Chris Benoit [in tribute to Eddie Guerrero]2] Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk3] Rob Van Dam vs. [Either John Cena or HHH]Matches that I alone predict:1] The Mexicools vs. the FBI [The ECW version of the FBI]2] Tommy Dreamer vs. Masato Tanaka3] Tajiri vs. Kid Kash vs. Simon Dean [Called Nova in ECW]4] The Sandman vs. Justin Credible5] Balls Mahoney vs. Axl Rotten6] Rey Mysterio vs. JBL [Just to continue the ""hating on ECW"" storyline by JBL]Should be great even if none of my predicted matches will happen. I ordered the last one on ppv and it didn't disappoint so hopefully this one wont either!"
2,SCRATCHED,"Got the double DVD...First DVD was fine. Second was so scratched up, its almost unwatchable."
3,ECW run by WWE,"ECW is back and I cant be more happier. The problem I have is that they are too much involved with Raw then being the company it once was. ECW on Sci Fi sucked the first few weeks but is getting on track, thanks in large part to Sabu's matchs. Raw needs to win back the world title and leave ECW alone to grow. I hope WWE doesnt ruin everything by having a ECW vs WWE match at this years Survivors Series (It is from Philly, so that tells you something)where winner takes all. Anther problem with ECW is I've only seen at least 12 athletes in ECW; They put a new guy on tv just last night, which is a good start. Bringing back Test is kind of stupid but oh well. As for the event, before I get comments saying this has nothing to do with the event, havent seen it yet. Hopefully they put the whole ECW vs WWE show as an extra on the dvd, that would be well worth it."
4,It Gets Even Better????,"This is the first Greeley novel I have read. It was a little hard to get into his style of writing at first, but then I couldn't put it down. I am Catholic and I loved learning more about the papal process and politics. I began looking for more of Greeley's books even before I finished this one. If, as some of the other reviews indicate, this is one of his weaker books, I can't wait to read more!"
1,I got to page 50,"It may be unfair of me to rate and review this book, since I didn't finish it. But the fact that I couldn't get past page 50 or so tells it all.I've liked some of Greeley's books in the past, but this one was so dull and preachy that I didn't know -- or care -- who was who or what was happening.The characters were pure stereotypes and the dialogue was as unbelievable as I've ever read. Who talks like that!!!Life's too short to waste on books you don't really like, so my advice is to pass this one by."
2,Not all that,"The story is that the 'plain' sister decides to raise her 'pretty' sisters baby. The pretty sister is so rotten that its almost too much to be believed. Then the so called hero Royce comes into play. He is the plain sisters boss and is a total degenerate. I realize this book was slightly before the AIDS epidemic but I would not have touched that guy with a full bio-medical suit on. Anyway, as usual once they give the plain sister a hair cut and some makeup she turns out to be a beauty. Royce keeps heeping abuse on her thinking that she slept with his brother (while the entire time he is keeping time with the nasty sister). Meanwhile his family blackmails her into marrying Royce so that his mother can get remarried and she (at the ripe old age of 23) can take care of his five siblings and her sisters baby. Nice huh? She would have been better off finding a nice home for her nephew and kicking her nasty sister to the curb and actually living her life. To me this book was sad."
5,EXCELLENT TOUCHING MOVIE,I love the movie so much in the sense that these men are torn between being religious and submitting to their sexual and emotional desires for each other. I was a little bit sad at the end but it is what it is especially in a place like Jerusalem and other places that are just as strict. Highly recommended for the open minded
2,Boring,"While this is based on a great concept, I felt that it took too long to build up suspense and was not really that frightening."
2,"Better title would be ""The Jewish Bible for *Christian* children""","Written from a christian perpective. Several references to Jesus, and the ""Old testament"" not only in the introduction - examples - the patriarchs live 1500 years before Jesus. There is a painting depicting Jesus being circumcised (as stated in the caption. Other inaccuracies such as the hebrew letters ""yod, hei vav, hei"" is usually written as ""Yahweh"" - um, only Jehovahs wittnesses people! One story suggests a sacrifice of a young woman which would never have been permitted. (Judges 11) Torah commentary teaches she lived in seculsion (the sacrafice being she never married or had children)I gave this 2 stars because most of the book is OK, but Jewish parents should be aware of these flaws. Would be an OK choice for a Christian child, though the take on Judges 11 is disturbing."
2,Rust on wheels,"This thing works great at first, good length and quality. But it rust its self closed in no time. You have to struggle to open either end of it. I would not suggest this to anyone. Find a better company with a better product."
3,Watch your dogs size,It says dog weight rated but it does not tell you what it is rated at. After I get it home I see it is for dogs up to 35lbs. My dog is 40 lbs so I am in a quandry. Bring my dog home and hope this works or keep him at my friends house till I can get another one (the correct size) and hope it ships fast. It would be nice if they would tell you the rated weight in the description.
2,Not for Educators and Parents,"This book is probably an excellent resource for those in the medical profession. It is not, however, for Special Education teachers and parents. There's some informative insights about the true condition of Fragile X in the book, but one must wade through all the medical and scientific lingo to find it."
4,Happy with this product,"The items came into a timely manner. There could have been more instruction on how to assemble but my husband was able to figure it out. The mechanism works very nicely - very easy to change the height by holding and lifting. Changing the slant of the keyboard tray not too difficult (involves a lever that works like a ratchet), and very easy to swing the keyboard tray from side to side. Overall, I'm very happy with this product."
5,"Exactly what I wanted, Cheapest price around","I got this for 14 dollars, it was a great buy and includes all the movies that other places were selling for 18."
5,great,Great get here over all price was a littler higher than in store but it was here almost over night and was easyer to bye tha in store.
3,The original christmas classic,Just sad as not itemed as zone 1 and unable to play..just love this collection grew up with it. allows kids to believe
2,Just get Rudolph,"I was looking for Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer when I stumbled on this set. While Rudolph is indeed a classic, I have to say that some of the others on this set are not worth the time to watch (and that is from my 8 year old daughter.) I have to imagine that 'cricket on the hearth' and 'santa claus is coming to town' were never much of a success, and calling them 'classics' is a misnomer."
4,Memories of Childhood TV,"I gave this four stars because they left out the Litte Drummer Boy. I really did enjoy that on TV. If you have the box set in plain dvd, be sure to keep it, just for the Little Drummer Boy. Otherwise, this is a great deal on this box set to enjoy with the whole family."
3,The original Christmas,"gets a lot grain,i dont like movies with grains,but is so clear . i know is a oldest movie but dont looks great."
5,Memories t,Great for kids of all ages.My grandchildren loved it and it brought back memories of when my son first saw it.
4,A Good Collection of Holiday Classics - Recommended,"""The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set"" is a collection of four Christmas specials on two Blu-Ray discs. This is a great way to share these with my family without waiting for them to be aired (with commercials and cuts) on network TV.Overall the transfers to HD were quite good for ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", and ""Frosty the Snowman"", with the exception being ""Frosty Returns"" (not my favorite anyway). The sound quality was decent enough on all of them, at least through my standard TV speakers.We enjoyed seeing these on own schedule, in their restored and uncut entirety!Recommended!CFHNote: Review copy provided by manufacturer"
4,My son loves it (I do too),"The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because I expected it to be remastared. I would suggest just getting the regular DVD set. It has all the pops and worn spots of the ones I used to watch on TV. I really enjoyed watching it with my son, it brought back a lot of memories."
1,WRONG PRODUCT INFO - only 4 shows in this package,The product description & the reviews attached here are for a different product (the one that actually says on its cover that it is 7 Christmas specials). This product is only 4 Christmas specials. Hope someone gets this listing fixed!
5,James Bond 007 Giftset,I bought this set for my husband's birthday - he's a long-time James Bond fan. He really likes it.
1,This was a very old book and I didn't realize it. It's not present day it's from the 1950 or 60's I think. Duh!,Very old book. Not prevalent for traveling now in Europe. I think it was wrote in the 1950's or 1960's. I feel stupid for thinking this book would help us in Europe.
3,Kindle edition so many typos!!!,"I love Alice Hoffman's work and have read almost all of her books. I don't know the technical process of bringing a book from its published state to the Kindle Edition, but whoever proofread this Kindle Edition must have been asleep! There were so many errors that at times it was hard to deciper what word was supposed to be on the page. I find typographical errors in print work INEXCUSABLE! Are there no professionals left in the literary world?"
3,Not one of her best!,"This book bites the dust--incest is a taboo theme, I know, but for a romance? It just doesn't work!I got the creeps, I got aggrivated, I got annoyed, i flung the book across the room and didn't return to it for nearly a week.This book is slow...slow...slow!The characters are crazy, annoying, whining, bitter--a ragtag bunch of losers at best, a poor excuse for literate fiction at worst. I couldn't identify with any of them! I actually was rooting for the downfalls of every stinking one of them--I hated Teresa and Silver and their mother Dina (and all the other characters peopled in this novel weren't so great either. They were all irritating in varying degrees.)If you want to read a good book about incest, pick up Anais Nin's works, or Kathryn Harrison's novels. These at least are suitable remorseful and poignant."
3,Austin Powers Wannabee,"This is an OK collection - especially for the low price. My feeling is that the publisher threw together some ""suave-ish"" tunes and throw the ""Shagadelic Hits"" title on it to capitalize on the Austin Powers craze of the time. Here's the tracks:1. Moonlight Feels Right: Starbuck2. Afternoon Delight: Starland Vocal Band3. You Took Advantage of Me: Tony Bennett4. Hernando's Hideaway: Archie Bleyer5. Let It Be Me: Jerry Butler & Betty Everett6. Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me: Mel Carter7. I'm In The Mood For Love: The Chimes8. (If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right: Luther Ingram9. Chanson D'Amour: Art & Dotty Todd10. Hello Stranger: Barbara Lewis11. Tell It Like It Is: Aaron Neville12. I Love How You Love Me: The Paris Sisters13. Help Me Make It Through The Night: Sammi Smith14. I Ain't No One Night Only Love Maker: Tom Jones"
1,Poor,"Although the seller shipped promptly and I have nothing against them, the fit of these thongs is terrible. They are too tight in the pouch and the thong strap is very irritating. I wear thongs daily and love the feel, but these are going in the garbage."
1,My junk doesn't fit!!!,"I bought the blue/brown tie-dyed pair and was thoroughly disappointed with them. Now, I am not claiming to be the most well endowed fella on the block but I simply cannot wear them due to the lack of a front pouch and how low they set in the front. I even bought the XL's for that reason. Waist-wise I can wear the L's but many such undergraments require me to purchase a size larger, hence the XL's. Guys, if you are packin' hardly anything then I'd recommend looking into a different pair of underwear. They look really cool in the packaging or just laying in the dresser drawer but the looks definitely don't out-weigh the discomfort."
1,Immensely Disappointed,"I have always felt that the ""Dr. Phil"" hype is out of control. Given the author has been married for 30+ years, I thought she may have had some good advice to share. While her father was an alcoholic and her mother very brave, there is really nothing remarkable about Robin herself. Just because there are so many who choose to fail despite wealthy/powerful ties, is no reason to extol one who's made use of these advantages...The good advice she did offer could be reduced to three pages. It is most certainly not worthy of a reader's time. I returned this book for a full refund."
2,Out of touch,"Sorry, I am a Dr. Phil fan and enjoy the peeks he gives us into his family but this book just got me angry. It does repeat constantly...how much Phil loves her, how wonderful a mother she is, how all around wonderful she is. You know, you can make the best choices throughout your life and still not end up in a fabulous life - like hers. Her attitude is lacking reality - perhaps her childhood was painfully real but her ""confidence"" rubbed me as arrogance. As a previous reviewer suggested, I think it would be a whole different book if she lived on $30,000 a year...oh, ya, that's right, she wouldn't make that ""choice."""
5,Inside My Heart: Choosing to Live with Passtion and Purpose,This is an awesome book for those that want to feel empowered with information to take action in your life and feel good about yourself as well. I think all women should read this. It's very inspirational.
3,A Devoted Wife and Mother,"Robin Mc Graw is a remarkable person in that way that she claims that we can take control over our lives by making good choices. Such a choice can be to love (adore) your husband in spite of him being an ordinary person with shortcomings as anybody else or to love your mother-in-law because she was the one who raised your husband and still is the one who cares most for him. Even to become a devoted mother is a choice that we make and also to believe in that we as mothers are the ones who know the best what's good for our children, sometimes better than professionals such as doctors and teachers. The lesson is that what we sow today we will reap tomorrow.The understanding Robin Mc Graw has, is like a bell ringing from the good old times. Her writing is an encouragement to those who lost faith in what they do and that it can make a difference how we handle time with our loved ones. It is a courageous message in our days of self-fulfilment!"
1,Disappointed,"As a mental health professional who believes that Dr. Phil takes a realistic, common sense approach to life, I purchased this book thinking it may be valuable. I have yet to finish the book, because I have found it to be of little depth and not much value. My initial impression has been that this book is more about how wonderful ""Phillip"" is, how he is really just an ordinary guy, etc... and less about life lessons. Since I have a positive opinion about both of these people, I am disappointed, could not recommend the book to anyone and am sorry I spent the $3.99 on the purchase."
5,Robin McGraw is SO real !!,"I don't read many books, I have never made time for it, but this one caught my eye. When I started it I was so interested in what she had to say, and she was so truthful. She and Phil had tough times growing up, and to see how she handled it was so inspiring. She is such a strong women and I really look up to her. I hope I can bring some of this to my life. Thank you for such a great story on life."
3,Less is Best,"This book from the start talks about the same topic over and over. There really was not a lot of meat to this which was surprising since Robin seems to come across on TV as extremely intelligent, witty, and insightful. I would not waste my time reading this book."
3,I expected more than I got from this book.,"I just finished Robin's book. I will admit I stayed interested in it most of the time and other times I just wanted to finish it. Sometimes I would just read some of the things she said and was left with ""huh?"" At times I thought she was just a little too good to be true. I would love to have heard more about her boys, there just wasn't a lot there. I really did love the advice she gave one of her sons about a girl, she was very right on with her advice. I don't know if I would recommend this book to any of my friends or not. I definitely won't read it again. She has a good life, that's great. She gets to sit in an audience each day and walk out holding her husband's hand each day. She's really a very lucky woman and very blessed. I think I'll stick to watching Dr. Phil. I like his show much better."
3,Typical,"Robin's book is so typical of her persona on TV, all smiles and gushing with pride of her husband and family. I expected something different, something deeper from her, only to be gagged on all the sugar."
2,Robin has made some good choices ya'll,"Very repetitive, fluffy, me, me, me, look at me. Should be renamed ""Inside my choice""."
3,Just above average...,"Robin speaks from the heart and seems to be a great person, loving wife and mother, but there isn't much depth to this book, so I was a little disappointed. While I did enjoy reading about Robin's past history, I was looking for more insight and practical advise to women. She touches very briefly on a few good ideas but there are no new nuggets of wisdom, spiritually or otherwise. The book reads very quickly because honestly there just isn't much here. A much better book is ""the Confident Woman"" by Joyce Meyer, for a true ""how to"" on living with passion and purpose."
1,Don't bother,Goes to show you almost anyone can be an author ... Especially if you have plenty of money and a well known husband. No value to this book. I believe it was written in one week. A true waste of my time and money.
3,Its was alright,"I don't think she could find any other way to state how much she adores her husband. The bottom line is you love him and accept him for who he is. Nothing new for those who like our partners. A true partnership/marriage is impowering and this is what she discusses in her book. Very lovingly written, but basic and borderlines on boring. If I had a choice to pick another book, I would pick something else."
2,Give Me A Break!,"The only reason this book was published was because she is married to Dr. Phil. This book is nothing you haven't heard if you have ever watched the Dr. Phil show. There was nothing new in the book. Robin thinks she is the female answer to Dr. Phil, without the Dr. in front of her name. She is not. All she is rich and getting richer."
1,SHALLOW,"This book is shallow and not intellectually challenging. It is sweet for her to share the stories of her life, but I didn't feel there was anything to ""learn"" from this life recap."
1,garbage,"The new made in Indonwsia pans are a piece of garbage. Warped covers do not fit tight,less copper, stain and do not clean as well as the older pans which I still have 3 about 35 years old. Never buy these products workmanship is awful just like the pans you can buy at the dollar store use once and throw away pieces of garbage. No more quality and pride in workmanship. I am returning the new pans which we bought friday and used saturday never again. Profit over product ruins another made in america product. Thanks corning ware for buying revere ware and ruining a very good product..."
1,Totally disappointed,"I definitely wasted my money! The skillet does not lie flat on flat cook-top. In fact, it is quite dangerous and should be taken off the market. Very, very dangerous when you have hot oil in skillet. Hopefully, Amazon will no longer offer it. Obviously, I am very upset."
2,revere cookware,"I like revere cookware, but this set came with some broken handles. I don't know if they can be returned or not."
1,Sorry that I let my son purchase this camera!,"I cannot say how very disappointed I was when my son opened the box that contained this camera! The viewfinder was broken, and the quality of this camera, even for the money spent, was pitiful. Please do not waste your time, effort, or money on this camera. The only bright side of this was the lesson learned by my son... you get what you pay for, or in this case... less."
3,It's the ending that loses me,"I was into the story, loved the art, the dialogue, and the angst, and.....the thrust of the conflict between the Children of Maya and The Bat peters out into inanity. I liked everything but that. The final two pages, with Batman still an indominatble spirit, flawed but resolute, I liked. In fact, every since Frank Miller's, ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"", I've been in love with the character. He's a superhero without superhero powers and his internal dialogues has been as intruiging as any of the external problems he's faced. In ""Absolution"" we have a story that gives full power to the internal angst that Batman faces in his lifelong struggle against the predators among us. Unfortunately, the climax depends on an apparent suicidal destructive act by the villian which resolves nothing except a need for plot development. It's not bad, it could have been so-so much better."
4,Good enough,They are nicely finished and have big tops. They came a little loose but they are still pretty sturdy. I'd purchase them again.
4,All wood,"The assembly of the stand was easy, the tables are all wood. The surface of the tables needs protection. A water based polyurethane helped."
4,Quality is good and service is excellent,"The tv trays are super sized, perfect for a real plate and drink with room left over. The finish is good but not perfect. The finish on the table tops is not uniform in that there are areas that do not appear to have a clear finish in all areas. This problem is resolved by using liquid gold or Old English furniture polish. I had a broken leg and a crushed foot part. The manufacturer immediately replaced the damaged parts. I can't ask for much more. I would reccommend to a friend."
4,Worth the money,I'm very satisfied with this product. The finish on the top of the trays is not the greatest but it's a TV tray. Easy assembly of the stand.
1,Surprised that Amazon would sell such an inferior product.,Each of the trays was scratched or had a blemish (which couldn't be covered up with scratch remover). Several of the trays were not stained on the bottom which was further evidence of sloppy workmanship. I strongly recommend that Amazon customers avoid Winsome products.
3,Misleading photo,"Consumers should be aware that the jewelry case does not include the necklace. No where in the photo or product description does it say ""necklace and hair clips sold separately."""
5,Jeb Rock,"Basically, as an Aussie I get alot more Jebediah than American's see. As much as Of Someday Shambles is an awesome album with some brilliant songs, most notably Star Machine and Please Leave. But all the songs are great in their own right. However the biggest shame is the fact that Jebediah's debut album Slightly Oddway wasn't relesed in the US as it is the most amazing album I own. It is one of the albums I can listen to non-stop a few times over. Just to note Jerks of Attention in Australia was on Slightly Oddway.Jeb rock, get all you can of em!"
2,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,"The review that settled the purchase for me on this Home Quick Planner stated that the furniture pieces could be peeled off easily. Then reused over and over again.This is not true! I really thought this was going to be a wonderful product; just what I was searching for.The first furniture sticker I applied to the board stuck with such force that it ripped the paper right off the board when I removed it!It sounded like the ideal product, but I was terribly disappointed."
4,Easy to use and very helpful,"This little interior design kit is well worth the money. In contrast to many computer programs, it's simple and easy to use. There are multiple of symbols for every room and item in your house - appliances, kitchen and bath fixtures, windows, doors and other architectural elements and of course furniture. You'll even be able to mark switches, outlets and phone jacks on your floor plan. The best thing about this kit is that it reminds me of my grade school days and all the fun I had with just scissors, paste and paper."
3,Better than lugging an organizer,This organizer is okay. Light & serves the purpose. I ride a bus to work & lug quite a few things & did not have the space for an organizer. I currently use a Palm z22 it's 4 years old & if I thought I could change the battery myself I would have done that a long time ago.
3,MAKE SURE to get a recent one!,"i gave this item 3 stars on account of it appears to be useful however the edition i got was published in 1989... needless to say a lot of places have changed names and affiliations in the interim; the section on the U.S.S.R. was the first i flipped to, leading to the sneaking suspicion that something was amiss... also seems to have every place in the world except for the U.S. - - which would be useful when doing a chart that has anything to do with the U.S. Which is where i am. as are most of the people i meet... still it appears at first blush to be moderately useful provided i can figure out what the specific place is called now, probably working along with a more recently published map or atlas. also just interesting to see one more little way the world was very different only a couple years ago. so make sure you know what you are getting before hand!"
4,"A good beginning, but...","As a person interested in politics and history who likes stories with a lot of complexity, I enjoyed this novel a great deal. The many different threads were woven together with a skill such that you couldn't see exactly *how* they were woven together until the end, when it started to make some sense.However, the problem I had with this story is the end. Even if I hadn't known it was a trilogy, I would have been able to tell from the way the author wrote it. It was all setup. Now, I'm used to cliffhangers when I'm reading a series, but usually there's at least some resolution at the end of each book. In this case, I felt it was nearly all setup and no resolution. If you're one who can't stand cliffhangers, I'd give this one a wait until more of the story is out.Of course, that may be the point. I am very eagerly looking forward to the next novel to find out what happens. :-)All in all, a good book, but the ending wasn't as complete as I would have liked."
1,Jams all the time,"We've had this price gun for a year, and it's very frustrating to deal with. It jams all the time due to tiny pieces of labels getting caught in the mechanism, and it's very time-consuming to unscrew the enclosed case to clear out the jam. The labels always get out of alignment. Would recommend you buy something else."
2,"Excellent for the price, but that's about it.","Good for movies,This subwoofer is mainly for BOOM BOOM BOOM SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE.It gives good effects on action movies and such,But if you are looking for controlled, fine, tight, quality bass, LOOK AWAY!I give 2 stars for the price and built quality.It is quite big as well,So, beware if you are looking for something small.Q) Would I recommend this to others?A) NO!I'd really like to return this, but I brought this to Guatemala and will probably cost more to return lol, I will have to use it for a while.Also, there is this annoying rattling sound when it reaches certain level of frequency.There is couple of other reviews mentioning this problem, it could be a defect.May be I was expecting too much from high ratings~I will definitely buy another subwoofer when I have chance and throw this away."
4,Great Subwoofer,"Fast Shipping, very good sound quality and easy setup. Best part of all is it $100 cheaper here than Bestbuy."
3,Get what you pay for,"I had a polk audio sub for 12 years, paid about 250 or so and it was great. It just blew and I bought this one. I bought it for the price price and because it was polk. figured it would be solidwhile I'm not expert on sound this subwoofer gives very bland bass, flat, and very shallow. it does not give the nice bass sound that is vibrant and rich and extends to the whole room. The best description I can give is the bass doesn't last, short and flat. Instead of a booooooooooom that continues it's like boom stop, boom stop, If you want better bass i would spend more. It works for me in the short term and 3 stars for price and it works. But not rich sounding at all. If figure out how to make this better i will edit review."
3,Size your room before you buy.,"The PSW10 is a very good sub-woofer. I am not disappointed with the performance but it lacks the bang that I was looking for. The room I have it in is large and open, if I had an opportunity to trade up for the bigger sub-woofer I would. But it is a decent piece of equipment and for the price I can not complain."
4,Polk Audio,This is a great subwoofer at a great price. I was told about nthis subwoofer by a friend and I must say it has loived up to all my expecations
3,Good for the price,"Hello I will keep this short. I have had this sub about 4 months and for the price it is not bad at all. It really depends on what you are using it for. I have a 2000 watt stereo system I have it in. Right now it is running with another self powered 10"" sub (an old RCA model, that is about 10 years old) I will say that this sub gets lost a little even compared to the older RCA, my RCA definitely out performs it and they are in the same class (both around 100 watts or so).This sub puts out clean bass but can't handle a whole lot if you are trying to really jam out with music, to me it would be better suited for a computer sound system, or just for movies/tv, or if you just like listening to music at a medium level.My overall opinion/recommendation: good sub for the price, but I would pay a little extra and go after something with a little more punch... even here on amazon you can get something like a BIC F12 (that has about 5 times the power) for only about $80 more dollars."
4,Things that go bump in the night.,"I am the proud owner or two of these babies. I use them in my Library and bedroom systems. Although these sub-woofers are not the latest and greatest of the huge quantity of sub-woofers available to us today, they do represent excellent value.They do not go down to 20hz but they do produce tactile bass that is so important in the reproduction of multi-channel movie soundtracks. They crossover between 80hz and 120hz so they will work with a large number of small speakers that lack this bottom end. The placement is flexible as you can adjust the gain, the crossover frequency and the phase. They can be attached to a system either through jacks from the sub-woofer jack on a surround sound receiver or with the speaker wires of the front channels passing through the sub-woofer. It's basically a 14"" black box and can be places anywhere it will fit in the room. Good dollar to sound value. Almost any system can benefit from the addition of a sub-woofer."
5,subwoofer review,"provides excellent addendum to five speaker set up previously without an active subwoofer, used primarily for classical music and jazz. room size a bit over 400 sq. ft. couldnt be more satisfied for the quality at this price."
3,use surge protection,"Great sound but we took a lightening strike and it fried the amp, sothere's not great surge protection designed in. The fuse on the ampblew, replacement fuses blow immediately, so the fuse wasn't good enoughprotection.I highly suggest using surge protection on this product."
5,Small room base fix,"Great addition to the small home theater. 16'X20' most movies require only 1/2 volume. Great throw, although I typicaly prefer a bottom firing Sub. Great value, solid polk construction. Allows you the option of reducing the base in the louds and rears cranking the sub for a wide seperation of ranges if your processor has a delay you can acheive that big IMAX sound! that is if you nieghbors will put up with you."
4,Boom boom,Great performance from a budget priced sub woofer. Delivers plenty of punch without adding distortion. It is well worth the money!
2,"Not worth the price, Buy the Polk Audio PSW505 instead.","I must have received a defective unit because my sub-woofer just did not perform. The low frequency was not there: no deep bass, no boom, no earth rattling shake and no LFE input. I even purchased a premium 6 inch RCA Female to 2-RCA Male Digital Coaxial Splitter Adapter from monoprice.com (highly recommend the website for cables) and the sub-woofer still did not perform. There is a small hiss coming from the speaker as well. Believe the negative reviews because they are true. Do yourself a big favor and purchase the excellent Polk Audio PSW505 12-Inch Powered Subwoofer instead. I already own one PSW505 subwoofer and it is amazing. I recently purchased another PSW505 to replace the defective PSW10. The PSW505 is a great value right now and it's only a little bit more. You definitely will not regret it."
4,Quality product with WRONG manual,"WARNING: PSW10 does not have a single subwoofer socket. Instead, you need use L or R socket for its stereo inputs.Good quality. Sounds ok, matched with my purchase of a pair of R50.Recommended for entry level home theater system."
5,Great sub,Arrived in perfect condition and works like a dream. I would prefer more pics of the back and a cable recommendation too but the sub itself is great.
4,nice,great sound... fast shipping. I did have a problem with the price. It was 20 dollars cheaper 2 days later. I call to complain but when I went back to check the price was 10 dollars more??? so if not in a hurry check prices for a couple days.D.Rooster
4,Worth it,Most def a great value. Cannot beat the quality at this price.It fills out my space nicely. Hard to beat at $100.
4,Nice subwoofer for the price.,"Just an echo of many of the other reviewers, for the price it's hard to go wrong. It runs circles around anything of a similar price point. I wish it had the LFE port, which the 12-inch model has, but you can recreate this fairly easily when you set it up. It is a little but uglier than it's modern counterpart the 111, but at less than half the cost I can hide it in the corner.So good sound for a normal to small room at a price point you can afford. This matches will with either the Polk Monitor Series or the TSi series."
5,Great powered sub and a great price,I installed this powered sub to supplement the low end of my sound system at the rears. I don't think I could have done that so well with another product at $100. I highly recommend this product and the seller!
3,Nice for the price,I had a Klipsch subwoofer that had a amp card go out on it. I used this as a replacement but used the Klipsch subwoofer and the legs that came off of it to increase the aesthetics of the unit. It truly rocks now and although my Klipschwas a bottom firing unit the legs are very stable and got the Polk sub off the ground and really increased its performance.
5,Polk Audio PSW10 Subwoofer,"Bought this sub as the finishing piece to my home theater. The new addition is teamed up with a 42' 1080P Philips Ambilight LCD, a pair of Mirage Omni 250 tower speakers flanking the flat screen, a Denon AVR-1705 receiver, a Denon DCM-290 CD Player and a Denon DVD-1740 up converting DVD player.Listening to music and watching movies has already been a phenomenal experience because of the Denon components and the Mirage towers. But the Polk Audio PSW10 truly enhances things. It provides terrific low frequency bass to all CDs and as well as to any burned MP3 and WMA files! Drumbeats pound with purpose and authority now. Suspense scenes in movies really shine because the sub will provide that 'low rumble' effect. The sub evenly distributes punchy, clean bass through the heightened scenes of motion pictures. A must buy!"
3,Get what u paid for,"My onkyo 8inch sub had started rattling so I got this 10inch I thought it was gonna b better but I was wrong, but it is a great deal for the price."
4,Great product,Excellent value and performance. Would like a light on front to indicate power.Also was surprised how large speaker was but am very happy with this purchase. Great product at good price.
4,a pep talk,"After a decade of growing anti-Semitism, some Jews seem more willing then ever to retreat from the secular and non-Jewish world. Sacks's book is a ringing rebuttal to this view, quoting a variety of Jewish sources. For example, he quotes the Talmud: ""for the sake of peace, the poor of the heathens shall be supported as we support the poor of Israel...""By and large, this is not the sort of book that imparts new information so much as the sort of book that tells us what we already know- a kind of pep-talk for burnt-out, bummed-out Jews. I liked it, but thought it was a bit too long for its message."
4,EVERY KITCHEN SHOULD HAVE A KITCHEN AID,Since I received my KitchenAid mixer I can make sugar cookies for everybody. Before with my other mixer I could only make one batch because the mixer would not mix it so I had to mix it by hand. I really think that was the best gift I have received.
4,This is not 73% off as advertised,"This is a wonderful item. However, the banner advertising this item at this site is very misleading. The banner states that this item is being sold for ""73% off."" In fact, this is a used (reconditioned) unit. It is being offered at full retail price for a reconditioned unit. If this were a new unit, then the claim of ""73% off""would be more honest but it is not. In fact, a search of even this site's offerings of the item new reveal that this is 73% off of an MSRP but perhaps only 50% off the available new price.I don't understand why such a good organization feels compelled to intentionally engage in misleading advertising."
2,Not so good.,"Me and my wife got one of these for a wedding gift and the first thing we noticed is that it was way too big for anything we wanted to make and would not mix the little amount of stuff we had in the bottom of the mixing bowl. So we traded it in for a smaller model. We found out that even the smallest model has a hard time mixing any regular sized batch of anything (from cookies to bread). If we leave the mixer alone, we come back and there is still unmixed ingrediants in the bottom of the bowl. It is easier to just use a hand mixer. Another problem is that it is almost impossible to add ingrediants to the bowl without buying the [optional] attachment. And last but not least, the dang screws keep coming loose on the machine and they have to be re-tightened every few times we use it. Overall, we are very dissatisfied with the product and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Get this Model for Weekend/Holiday occasions!! Mixer Shoppers don't be Stupid!!,"Don't mind my bad spelling but........We rate it Four Stars becuase of the expectations of KitchenAide products are high. We believe that this model is great for holiday and weekend bakers/cooks. Not for the everyday, likes to make everything under the sun type( if you are thats great!). The value is awesome and recommend that you buy the pouring shield along with it ( around 20$). Power is at a 7 becuase there are stronger models available. Duribality is an 8. Versatility is a 9. Easy use is a 8.5. And cleaning is a 9. Value is a 10... So overall its an 8.6! So take some time to read other reviews and to helpb make your choice, but we recommend KithenAide brand of mixers overall."
1,God Seeker,"Seems like WB method is nothing new - testimony - dispute - advocacy. Sounds like Hegel's - thesis -antithesis - synthesis ? WB like Purdue and others see the collapse of history as a way of understanding ancient Israel,but if all we have left are words,who would want to trust a god who talks but doesn't do anything ?"
2,A shocker,"Terrible movie, top notch acting. After this, I can see why the producers of Simon & Simon make an effort to portray McRaney as the warm and caring big brother. He is simply hateful in this film."
1,No Consumer support for sure!,"We purchased this chair from Amazon a yr ago. After about 9 mos the ropes frayed and in Dec completely broke. The chair has been on the floor for over a month. I contacted the company and after numerous emails have gotten absolutely no where. The chair is supposedly under warranty, but my color ropes won't be available until April - It seems only the owner of the company can order things and he is away for several months! We were offered a different color set of ropes plus shipping and handling. I have been told the ropes were shipped over a week ago UPS. Still NO ropes. The office mgr. said she would check into it --- NO EMAILS OR CONTACT SINCE Jan 26, today is Jan 30. Ask me if we will purchase anything from these people again - NO way. We went out and purchased our own ropes so we can use our chair - we live in Hawaii and love sitting outdoors, but NO chair!"
2,Oh well,"We set up the panic Mouse 360, and our cat just looked around for the source of the noise, but wasn't at all impressed by the bouncing black ball on the stick. When we turned it off, he grabbed the ball, but the whole arm came off. A little crazy glue solved that problem, but he just isn't impressed at all by the turned on toy. He's a bit hard to please, I guess."
2,Soaked in Seattle,"We put this tent up in our backyard to do a ""dry"" run before our trip. WOW, one day of rain in the backyard and all the sleeping bags were soaked. Looking closer we found that the side to floor seems were not quality at all. You could see parts were almost transparent. Clearly this is either a ""second"" or quality control isn't what it used to be. If you are guaranteed sunshine go for it. I loved the design and it was super easy to put up which is why I gave it a 2 instead of 1."
2,Trees and Shrubs,"The book has great pictures and covers any plant you could ever think of but is lacking in its content. Do the math, 8,500 trees and shrubs covered in 815 pages. That does not leave much room for a complete description. It is a very attractive book to look at, but is not for the serious landscaper or nurserymen."
1,FEE LIONS,"Cat Power's Myra Lee was recorded at Four-Track in my Bedroom Studios in Hokoken, NJ. The unique name of this band comes from the vocal style of Chan Marshall, who's crooning sounds like that of a slowly dying feline. If you listen closely to the track ""Enough"", there actually is a cat being rung through an old-tyme dryer. Cat Power's simple bare-bones approach to music has a convienient clumping action, that will leave your box clean and refreshed. Look for C.P. to collaborate with Snoop Doggy Dogg for a clawing rendition of ""Cat Scratch Fever"" in the early summer of 2000."
3,Lifetime Warranty?,"I bought this starter based on its claim of being brand new, not re-manufactured.It has worked since I put it in several weeks ago.The starter unit was made in Taiwan.I have not received documentation for lifetime warranty.How will Bosch know if I had a warranted product of theirs, how will I prove it to them without a warranty document.I thought Bosch offered free roadside assistance to buyers, I have not received any paper for that.If Bosch is reading this, please send warranty&roadside; assistance documents."
1,Stop the Madness,"Timberlake has hit a career low with this song. If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen. God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single. I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song. It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas ""My Humps."" Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it. It makes my stomach churn as I think about it. Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!"
3,least fave of teh series,"I read all of this series, even Reckless Love, teh historical which began the sgag of these familes The MacKenzies and the Blackthorn. This one just didn't quite doi it for me. Mainly because Diana is a rape victim and I suppose I can't relate to that (fortunately), but I think her character's fear of men is almost unbelievable to some extent. I like Ten, I liek Diana, I like the strraction, but something just didn't have me engulfed in the book and done with it in a day or two, like the other had. All in all I would recomend reading it to keep in sequence with the series."
5,El Romantico Virtuoso,"Amigos latinos y no latinos,recordar es vivir y recordar las cosas bellas y agradables de la vida es maravilloso.Las canciones seleccionadas en el album;CANCIONES DEL ALMA, son numeros inolvidables que nos traen gratos recuerdos, especialmente cuando se ejecutan con el conocimiento de los instrumentos y voces de este magnifico TRIO, que han tratado como muchos otros de revivir y homenajear a aquellos inolvidables del ayer.Personalmente quiero felicitar al director del trio LUIS DE JESUS por su naturalidad y ejecucion de muchos Instrumentos de cuerda como LA GUITARRA,EL TRES, EL CUATRO, EL TIPLE y otros.Ademas quiero recomendar este CD a los amantes de la musica romantica."
1,Same Exams all over again,These folks have been using the same exams for years (and they're not terribly good interms of accuracy to the MCAT format). Not worth it.
3,Fantastic singer,"Not as great as her previous, but good enough for fans. I bought it in Italy and I'm a big fan. Not up to her previous CD. Really old rock and roll fans will recognize ""La Terza Luna"" from the flip side of the Neil Sedaka hit ""Let's Go Steady Again"". So while you may think these are new songs..."
3,Oh so disappointing.,This book has it's uses but what I wanted was more reproducibles. After 4 years of hand writing multiplication sheets for various children (max class size is 4) I wanted to be able to scan and copy. Guess what... There is only 12 reproducibles in this book. TWELVE!!!! Out of 71 pages... Are you kidding me!!! I know how to play multiplication bingo. I know how to set up multiplication problems with beans. I even know how to make flash cards. What I wanted was the reproducibles. I am flat disappointed. Do not buy this book expecting to find the Holy Grail of multiplication. Only buy this book if you can not think of one single multiplication idea. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is for the person who doesn't have a clue where to start. This would be a good book for them. For people with an imagination or some experience this book is a dud.
4,"Great ""coloring book: for adult children!","Great non electronic pass time for adult children. Nice product, challenging and relaxing. I would recommend for anyone over ge 12. I used as stocking stuffer for adult children."
5,"USA Made by OTC Quality you can count on, not a junk tool !","Under $80, From Amazon.com so buy it now and never have to drive round trip to themachine shop at your local parts store !This tool pays for itself the first time you use it,removes and installs all ball joints.Also good for U joints on rear wheel drive cars.This is not a junk tool from China, it is USA MADE by OTC."
5,Excellent choice with an great price,"I was searching for a stainless steel cookware set. In fact, I hadn't any experience buying one of this, so i decided to read the reviews for many trademarks selling in Amazon. I found out that Revere cookware had a reasonable cost and according to the reviews with great quality. I bought it almost a year ago and don't regret my choice..."
5,as advertised,My sauce pan arrived in about 4 days and was exactly what I ordered. Revere has been the choice in my family for decades. Quality products that really do last forever. My mother has a set older than me! (I'm 36)I received my set in 1994 as a house warming gift and I'm still using them almost daily. They're like new and always perform to my satisfaction. I highly recommend Revere cookery.
3,Rough edged debut held an undercurrent of promise,"Of course this band's early art-rock drew tons of comparisons to early Sonic Youth, some of it completely justified. Although the singer eventually grew beautiful in her voice, here on the groups first disc she often mimics Kim Gordon's terrible talk-sing style, albeit with a little less nastiness inflected upon her delivery. Add to the mix mostly distorted guitar work centered around the sometimes pretentious lyrical delivery and it was easy to dismiss the band as another NYC wannabe. Even though it took a while to show, there were quite a few hints here that this band would continue to intoxicate with melodic commitment, despite being consumed with the noisy aspects of their blossoming career."
5,A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc,1. Kelly Clarkson - A Moment Like This2. Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway3. Kelly Clarkson - Miss Independent4. Kelly Clarkson - The Trouble With Love Is5. Kelly Clarkson - Low6. Kelly Clarkson - Some Kind Of Miracle7. Kelly Clarkson - Beautiful Disaster8. Kelly Clarkson - Before Your Love9.

2,German Kommando Extraordinary,"German Kommando ExtraordinaryThis book is a popular biography of the SS officer whose rescue of Mussolini, kidnapping of Admiral Horthy, and activities in the Battle of the Bulge where the most visible Nazi special operations in World War II were employed. The first third of the book deals with wartime operations, and the remainder with complex postwar purported neo-Nazi activities and links. Overall, I have found this book to be readable and although the material is dated and is peppered with historical flaws, it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will not appeal to the professional and armchair military historian but will provide a lite and somewhat entertaining read."
4,One of his best.,"Set in Maine and Boston, Gerry Boyle does excellent sense of place, interesting characters, particularly his friend Clair, involving plots and good red herrings. I've always enjoyed this series and this is one of the best."
1,"Little Camera, bad idea","Got the camera to capture all of our holiday memories, we did and then tried to download them to the computer... Once we did this we relized that all of our special times had horrible sound. It sounded like we were in a tunnle and it produced alot of feedback as well. I tried to contact SVP several times and had no luck with them getting back to me... Sorry, but I have no faith in SVP..."
2,Not that great,"This lamp burned one of the contacts, making one of the sockets unusable. The tripod is quite flimsy. Not professional grade at all."
1,Stand broke,"I have used the light about 3 times. The screw piece that holds the fixture to the telescoping stand broke. This was not from abuse in any way... the thing still looks brand new, except broke.Very disappointing after buying something I thought was high end."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I bought this one, with my first son, and of couse the suction stopped after about two weeks. I have tried 3 other Evenflo pumps (both electric and manual) and not a single one has lasted longer than 2 weeks before they lost the suction. Don't waste your money. It's tempting because of the price, but read the reviews! Don't get stranded in the middle of the night with engorgment and having to send your husband out to find one!"
2,Worked but loud and slow and had to stop and restart.,"I got this a a baby shower gift. It was what I had asked for but I was very disappointed after the first use. I had to keep stopping it so the milk would flow into the bottle. Plus, it was so loud I couldn't even hear the TV. Thank goodness I only had to pump a few times or I would have went nuts. I am going to buy a manual pump with my next baby. And I will definitely read the reviews before I waste $40."
1,doesn't work at all,"this pump is not worth a cent - the suction is next to nothing. i can express 6+ oz by hand in 15 min, but ZERO oz with this pump!!"
1,Threw it away!,This pump worked for about a week. It kept getting milk sucked into the motor and finaly it just died. I should have known. I bought a meleda single pump to replace it and it works great. I didn't pay full price for this thankfully so I just threw it away.
2,The money you think you'd save with this pump ends up being a waste of money,"Thinking about saving money?? (who doesn't in this difficult times?) Then steer clear from this pump. Its price may be alluring, but this pump does not work. It is a waste of money! Unless you are severely engorged and leaking, it takes FOREVER just to get a few ounces. And suction gets worse over time.The reason why I did not give this pump one star, it's because there are pumps out there that are even worse -like the Gerger pump with massaging action-."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT!,"I had my baby 3 weeks ago, by c-section so i'm not too sure about my milk supply.But i can pump 2 oz. in 15 minutes and it's annoying cause i don't know if that's good or bad.their are times when milk gets stuck in the filter part and one day i tryed to make it go into the bottle and milk went all over my clothes!If you have a good milk supply this pump is for you, if not this pump will test your patience!"
1,Terrrible Pump,This is the worst baby product purchase yet. Is noisy and had to have another motor sent to me and it still doesn't work. You get all the stuff it comes with for only this price for a reason. Very disappointed!!
1,Very Poor Design,"I took this model tent, brand new, camping in California, near San Fransisco, in the middle of april and it failed horribly. Tent poles snapped in the wind, there is no way to close up the vented ceiling so we had a gale flowing thru the tent all night, the tent stakes look reenforced but bend really easily and more than that the material that the tent is made of is not rip stop or if it is it is a very poor version there of. Over all I would suggest that you save your money and buy something else. Normally I love coleman equipment, but this is just a really poor product and anyone who bought one of these should demand their money back. This tent is portrayed as a 3-Season tent, it is only usable in summer at best."
3,Not what they use to be...,"While this pot is beautiful looking as all Revereware is, it is not the same quality as my 30 year old Reverewear. The stainless steel is not nearly as heavy and the lid doesn't fit properly. Food has to be cooked at a lower temperature otherwise it sticks. Otherwise, I guess for the money is it ok. J.M."
1,LID DIDN'T FIT,"The pot was nice, but the lid did not fit. Very disappointing, especially, when the product was suppose to be new."
4,Hm.. A good deal..,"I purchased this trolley to replace the one that disintegrated. Our dog is a 55 lb boxer, but she has a tendency to be as hard on objects as a 100 lb dog. So we got her a longer trolley.That said, our yard kind of sucks for this.. because we wound up having to fanoogle a piece together to attach this to, and then it didn't work anyway.The leash from the trolley to the dog's collar is a little flimsy, and she had fun pulling it apart. Not sure how she did it, but she did. So we put the old, thicker cable leash on her and she stays now.It's a good purchase, much more reasonable than Petsmart or Petco (Went to both before buying this.) NOT good for EXTREMELY active dogs or yards without reliable trees. haha."
2,Don't Buy It!,"This Antenna has served it's purposed well for me watching basic stations, like Fox, NBC, ABC, and CBS. It has trouble picking-up PBS sometimes, which really annoys me.It was an improvement over the previous Antenna I had, that was meant for analog signals. However I bought a $20 GE Flat Panel Antenna at Target, and it worked much better than the RCA. I find sometimes I need to adjust the RCA for it to get a signal. It also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room. No Problems with the GE. I even attached a signal amplifier to it, and it didn't seem to help much. I would just get a another Antenna for a little more money."
2,Weak at best,"I figured an amplified antenna would be better than a regular one. I was wrong. The unamplified antenna I have produces the same quality picture, or better, for half the price. Very disappointing."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This antenna is a huge waste of money. I live in a strong signal area (<5 miles to the towers). On an analog tv this antenna produced an extremely noisy picture due to the poor amplifier. Without the amplifier, this antenna did not produce a picture. On a digital tv this antenna did ok. However, a cheap pair of rabbit ears with a UHF loop greatly outperformed this antenna both on digital and analog tvs. I would not recommend the RCA ANT301 to anyone, even if were free."
5,Great Mexican cookbook.,"Oaxaca is the home for some of the worlds best food. This book has a lot of great recipes, including some moles which I can't wait to make. There is a nice narrative about the region, people, ingredients, and of course cooking. This is a must have for any person wanting to venture out and try a different cuisine. One of my favorite cookbooks for sure. These aren't 30 minute meal recipes, but if you love to cook, and have some time, this is a great book.Update: Made the Mole Negro de Oaxaca, though a bit time consuming, definitely worth it! It was the best mole I have ever eaten, and I am a mole lover! Most ingredients are readily available at the store."
1,Don't waste your money,"While the book covers legitimate technology, it does not cover anything in sufficient depth. Additionally, there are numerous topics totally irrelevant to the subject matter being tested. Buy another book............."
4,Amazing!!!,I saw this book at a friend's house a few years ago and I just had to get a copy. It is truly amazing!
5,Great!,"I'll start by saying that I've read a fair amount of books in my day. This book, for its genre, is probably the best (second would probably be The Circle of Innovation by Tom Peters) that I've read.I'm honestly AMAZED by how concisely he communicates points in a matter of paragraphs that would take other authors entire books.There also haven't been all that many books where I've started to laugh out loud in the middle of. I really like this guy's way of getting straight to the point."
4,Makes you realize we all deal with life's ups and downs,I liked this book a lot- it is an easy read and reminds you not to envy anyone because no one escapes this life without some trials and tribulations.Peggy Flemming's approach to her cancer diagnosis and her quest for physical fitness are compelling. Buy this book- it makes you glad to be healthy and alive!!!!
1,Clueless:the honest opinion,"Okay,I did not like this book,as well as the rest of the series which does not seem to have too many good books, because of the way the author writes out her storyline.She dragged it out and still the storyline acheived nothing. It makes you wonder what the point of the book is.It's basically all about how Elizabeth and Blue are still going on how about they're just friends and no-one believes them{Anna,Jessica}and that is the main storyline in this book.Also included is a tiny storyline about how Big Noise is holding auditions for a female bass player{which also included a minor laugh with the flyer part} and one about how Jessica is scheming with Ronald because she doesn't want Lacey on her olympic team{she gets what she deserves for trying to fix this}.Bad series or not, I really would like to know what possessed the author to call her character Blue Spiccoli??! It sounds like some weird food you don't want to end up on your plate!"
1,Eh....Two thumbs down.,"Ok, first of all, I didn't like this book very much. I skipped all the parts about Jessica and Damon, and only read the Blue and Elizabeth parts. I didn't like how Blue was always saying 'dude' and 'bummer' all the time. I also didn't like how Jessica TRIED to play matchmaker, Elizabeth poorly denying the fact she likes Blue, and Damon always getting on Blue about their stupid band pratices.This book was basiclly about Blue and Elizabeth trying to convince everyone they're only friends and always will be, although it's stupidly obvious to everyone around them they like each other.I read this book in half an hour. After i was done, if left me to wonder why Francine Pascal name a charecter Blue Spiccoli. What kind of a name is Blue Spiccoli? Anyway, The storyline is dragged out until its gets to a point where it was discustingly boring. In other words, there is really no point in reading this book. Don't waste your money. Spend it reading a book worth your time."
2,boring,"This book was REALLY boring. If you're like though, and you have to read EVERY svjh book, I'd suggest borrowing it from the library and not wasting you're $$ on it."
1,not so impressed,"The HD quality is not that great and isn't compatable with a lot of surround sound remotes which means I will always have to use two remotes. There is an option to change the picture size, but it never seems to fit the picture well. I don't reccomend this television for the selling price."
2,Not a favorite at our house,"The quality of the performance of this CD is quite good, but I found it is not at all suitable for very young children. The lyrics are very hard for toddlers to understand, and I found the musical accompaniment to be rather boring. Yes, it introduces classical music to children, but it's not done in a fun and entertaining manner. My 20 month old was not at all interested in this CD, and neither was I."
2,probably not what you want,"I was looking for a simple CD of classic nursery songs play for and sing with my daughter. This is a classical music CD of a particular songbook from the 19th century - well sung, and perhaps kids might like listening to it, but it's not what I wanted. She could be singing Schubert for all you know - they're definitely not kiddy tunes. If you're looking for simple, classic, sing-a-longs, keep looking (I'm still looking! Why is everything either off the mark, like this CD, or adulterated with ""original, fresh"" looks at old tunes, how about just a normal CD of normal songs! I can't remember them after 30 years, but I'd like to). Incidentally, while I recognized some of the song titles, these are different versions."
3,Rusty,"These are cheap, but they work. Unfortunately, the material rusted as soon as they saw any moisture.This makes twenty-one words."
3,not so good..,"this saucepan has some white cloudy spots around the bottom after some lightusage, look kind of ugly and you can't clean it up."
2,did not translate well to the Kindle,"Since I got my Kindle I have been strictly alternating between modern literature and classics. Robinson Crusoe seemed a perfect choice when it got time to read my next classic.I would like to say that I have given the novel a fair shot - but I just can't get over how poorly this was recreated for the Kindle. I'm not sure if Defoe actually spelled so many words incorrectly himself (I acknowledge that language was not as standardized during his time as it is today), but I have to cringe when I read a sentence such as: ""As for the smaller thing, I made them with better success, such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the fun baking them very hard.""I highly doubt Defoe would have written ""fun"" in place of the word ""sun.""The Kindle editors need to work a little bit harder when republishing a classic into e-book format."
2,"I was hoping for ""so bad it's good."" Instead it's mediocre.","Behold I bring you Goldengirl! She was made to be the best! She was programmed to do the impossible! She was the subject of a pretty damned mediocre movie. Honestly, I'm disappointed. Now in the time I've been doing this blog, I've been disappointed by movies that weren't as good as I expected them to be on more than one occasion. But I'm not disappointed because I expected Goldengirl to be anywhere close to good. To the contrary I expected it to be absolutely terrible. Given the film's sort-of insane premise and (a team of investors, a high-end sports agent, and a eugenics-obsessed scientist team up to create and package the next sports sensation,) and the fact that it was essentially a star vehicle for someone who never became a star, (at least I'd never heard of Susan Anton before I stumbled across this,) I was really looking forward to 90 minutes of a so-bad-it's-good cinematic mess.My full review is here: [...]"
1,Not at all what I expected,"My mother use to have Revere ware and it lasted for years and years.This stuff is thin,cheap, and barely put together. I have not used it so Iwill probably send it back.This stuff does not deserve to bear the name ...Revere.It was a waste of money."
2,the lid fit poorly and the handle got hot quickly from the steam,"This Revere 1400 Line 3-Quart covered saucepan has a copper bottom and is light weighted. Those are actually the qualities I wanted. Unfortunately, the lid did not fit well so the steam traveled up to the handle and made the handle extremely hot very quickly. I certainly got my fingers burnt the first time I used the saucepan."
2,CHEAPENED REVERE WARE,TAKE A GOOD PRODUCT AND MAKE IT CHEAPER OVER SEAS.It is begining to become the American way. AMERICANS WILL BE STRUGGLING ALL THE MORE!Maybe buy American will help ? Won't hurt!Our new Revere 3 qt pan is lighter and not worth the money we paid.
2,BIG difference between old and new!,"The other reviewer is right about old Revere Ware; its great stuff that'll last forever. However, newer Revere Ware, like what's being advertised here, is total junk. I own an old 2qt saucepan and a brand new 4.5qt Dutch oven. The Dutch oven is flimsy and the lid doesn't fit well. If you want good Revere Ware make sure it's from the USA (not Indonesia, like the new stuff) and OLD. Try yard sales or ebay. The only thing to recommend new Revere ware is the 25 year warranty. That is the only way the old and new products are comparable."
1,I absolutely wasted money on this Sock-N-Shoe Aid!,This item is not worth a dime. I am very disappointed. For me the handles are too long. It is impossible to maneuver. I can't use it at all. Many items that are described to help disabled people remain independent prove to be all wrong. This item surpasses all the scams. Don't buy it!EGL
2,not the best costume,In my opinion this costume is poorly made and doesn't really look all that much like the picture. I expected much better quality. Definetly not worth the money.
3,disapointing!,I was very happy with the service of Amazon but I bought the Revere set because I was so impressed with the set of a friend. His got his 15 yrs. ago & it was made in the USA...I was very sad to see mine is inferior & made in China!
2,Glad I didn't read the preceeding novel,"I saw the film ""Nowhere in Africa"" without having read the book. I liked the film so much it made me want to read the sequel, Somewhere in Germany. Now if the first novel was as naive, infantile and non charming as its sequel, then I am glad I watched the movie and not read the book."
4,3 disks of fun,"We had just watched the movie Brassed Off and were inspired to look for recordings by the colliery band in the movie. How happy we are to have ordered this one. It is 3 disks long and wonderfully recorded. You get all the great, thick sound of a well tuned brass concert band. Yummy. The choice of tunes is rather eclectic, running from the traditional to arrangements of pop."
5,one of the best mystery fiction writers,"I couldn't believe there were no reviews for this book. David Housewright is one of the best mystery fiction writers I have read. His stories are fast paced, witty and exceptionally well plotted. There are two other Holland Taylor mysteries equally excellent."
1,Reprint city...,"This book has 5 condensed versions of previously published books (meaning old). I bought it thinking it was a new collection of stort stories. Not only were the stories previously (and I do mean previously) published, they were condensed to the point that they were silly. As I was reading, it was very obvious when the story was being condensed, as the continuity of the story was ruined. If you like Jayne Krentz, and/or the other authors in this book, buy the previously published non-condensed works. They are easy, quick reads anyway!"
4,I Will Purchase This Book,"I will buy this book soon as a private tribute to a dear friend of mine, Jeff Gray, who is one of the models in the book. I remember him showing me the photos which Robert Mapplethorpe had taken of him. At the time, he doubted that they would ever be published. I did see the book later, but didn't purchase, but I was impressed.When Jeff was lying in bed in a hospital in San Francisco, I called to inform him that the book had indeed been published. He was thrilled to know that he had been immortalized, for he was dying of AIDS. Jeff never saw the book and didn't have anything negative to say about Robert, whom I never met. I still own a pair of leather pants and a vest Jeffrey designed and made for me."
1,Crap,"The sound sync is off, and the video transfer is one of the worst I've ever seen. I have bargain bin VHS versions of ""The 39 Steps"" that put this POS to shame. The disclaimer that 'This Collectors Edition has been digitally restored to improve picture and sound quality WITHOUT DEGRADING THE LOOK AND FEEL of this historic example of early cinema.' should be read as 'we didn't try very hard to correct the overexposed look of the crappy film stock we were using, and hope you'll excuse the missing film bits and the muffled sound track.'"
2,the stroller is awful!!!,"i received this as a shower gift before my daughter was born. the carseat was great, but you could find a thousand more that would be as wonderful as this. my daughter is 14 months old and we can no longer use the stroller. the front wheels always stick and sometimes fold forward making the stroller uneven.now that i have done some research i could have found a much cuter pattern with a stroller that would have lasted through preschool."
5,Great Stroller,For the money its the best you can buy and then some!!!! We are so happy with our decision and would buy it over again if we had more kids. I actually bought one similar for my sister.
5,excellent product,excellent item for the price.....works exactly as described and pricing was much better than ebay or the wayyyy over priced boat stores. shipped fast and securely.
1,"Comfortable and small, but easily leaks","When used with a 4"" riser platform, this unit was very comfortable for an adult. However, the black tank design was horrible and easily leaked on the first camping trip....what a mess! Unlike a Thetford, the waste cap is directly on the back of this unit, which means any slight movement of the unit will begin to unscrew the cap and cause the unit to leak. The side clips and main seal between top and bottom pieces are also prone to leaks and breakage. So, I'm throwing this one out and buying another Thetford."
1,Not worth it,"Despite the other reviews, we decided to take a risk on purchasing this toilet for our camping trip. It leaked from the lid on the holding tank and made a terrible mess. Something must be wrong with the seals installed on these and I would not recommend purchasing this brand."
3,A moving story,"This is a moving story, beautifully narrated. If you are a fan of George Winston, however, the narrative is too distracting, and it sadly drowns instead of marrys his beautiful music. A less sensitive critic might say this CD sounds like a Yoko Ono bedtime story, but I won't go there. Choose another George Winston selection, UNLESS you are in search of the story."
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book - it's more of an art history book than a gardening book, and it's a history of some fairly insignificant art at that (with some exceptions). I found the text to just be a list of artwork. It was extremely uninformative. Even the illustrations weren't all that attractive, since so many were in black and white."
1,Terrible!,"I wrote a bad review of this book 2 years ago, and can not find it here... it is one of the WORST reference books I have seen. I ended up selling mine as ""used"" here on Amazon! The glowing reviews must be from spam-reviewers or students/people who just don't use C++ except as a better C. C++ it large and complex, and only a fraction of it is covered in this ""reference"". Today I found ""C++ In a Nutshell"" which is finally the real C++ Reference. Ignore all others. (I do like Shildt's Java books, this is bad editing, formatting, or a half-hearted effort.)"
1,Abysmal,"This is an appalling reference book. Haphazardly organised with insufficient depth on any function or keyword. No consideration of actual implementations, poor type coverage, no syntax coverage beyond single case examples. Negligible template coverage.Give up now and instead get ""C++ In A Nutshell"" by Ray Lischner which is an excellent and thorough reference that actually deserves to be called a programmer's reference. I replaced ""C/C++ Programmer's Reference"" with ""C++ In A Nutshell"" and I'm very glad I did."
3,I like it but dissapointed!,"The colors shown here are not AT ALL what I received! It shows clear w/ red, pink, purple and light blue and I received a clear blue container w/ green, blue, and orange spout covers and orange writing on the top! I think it is a great product for it's purpose but I was expecting completely different colors! I think if the colors don't matter to you then I would say get it! I am going to keep it because I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it otherwise I would return it. I took away one star for the color mishap and the other star for the company misleading you on this issue. There is nowhere that shows or says that it will not be in the colors shown!!"
3,"Item ok, service awsome","Book was a bit more used than described, but fine. Seller was late sending and gave me a discount for that reason. Very Good Customer Service."
4,A Fun Little Movie,"I caught this on the late show when I was 13 and, while not the greatest movie in the world, it has always stayed with me. The comedy works, it has a few humorous Hitchcockian moments (particulary the scene with four characters hanging over an elevator shaft), and the climax is very reminescent of ""The Naked Gun"" (with Leslie Neilson). In fact, it could best be described as a poor man's ""North by Northwest""...and I mean that as a compliment. And I'll dig any movie that has a villain calling himself ""Constant Reader""."
1,Great follow up to an already monumental text!!,"10 out of 10 stars for the follow up to her groundbreaking 1997 release. I only wish she would have given a mention to one of the most successful owner-handler teams in recent years, Keith Carter and his amazing Rottie Shaka Zulu. He incorporated many of her tactics in his very successful campaign of that dog. Other than this ""flaw"" I was totally satisfied with the book...."
2,Bad text,"The book I received was put through a bad word recognition program without an editor from a copy of the original. Thus the paragraphs, indentations and punctuation were garbage making reading very difficult. Several words, names and dates were misread by the program. Mine was a blank covered edition, not the striped icon edition which was fine. I believe it was the newest General Books edition, so if you wish to read this, buy an older edition."
4,Toe rin,It is a cute & fun toe ring.I like the fact that it is adjustable.I use Arm and Hammer baking soda with water to keep the sterling sliver clean and shiny.
3,My problem,Was fine but needed more action and better play by plays. could have been much better. but was fine. okay
1,waste,wasn't worth buying. the background was too dark to see to even play this game to it's full potential. I didn't like it much.
1,bad choice,"This is an awful choice,I'v got stuck with it; some trucks are like an antithesis of music.[# 1 in particular] I wish had a longer time to listen to the tracks than the 15 seconds that provide.A disappointing experience,it's a risk you take when you buy things over the internet and can't return it once it's open."
1,Needlessly Confusing & Discouraging,"I've never written a review for Amazon, but feel strongly about this particular book. I feel that it fails to adequately prepare candidates for the PMP examination. In my opinion, if you want to minimize your study time and maximize your PMBOK comprehension then DO NOT USE THIS BOOK.In my opinion it is needlessly confusing and out of synch with the rhythm of the PMP exam-- which tends to have more direct questions. I used the Mulcahy book, which was more to the point and had questions that more closely resembled the actual PMP format.My Mulcahy practice exams were coming in at about 70% after the first read through of her book and over 90% after the third read through. By contrast, the Ward practice exams were coming in at about 55%. I passed the PMP on my first attempt with a 1/2-hour to kill after reviewing my responses.Happy studying and good luck!!!"
2,"Fly Fishing Yellowstone National Park, DVD","To have been able to write a more positive review, would have been much more enjoyable BUT I must be honest. This DVD was a disappointment! I expected much more overall, better photography ( I have taught photography for 30 years), more substantive information with far less redundancy and techniques/strategies relevant to the various stream conditions found in the park. I have just returned from camping in the Lamar Valley and found this DVD of little help. There are a couple of books that are truly exceptional in it's place..........."
3,Good but not great.,This is a good TV movie for kids and adolesence. Maggie Smith is always good but I think she has been better. I think the plot was a little light on substance.
3,"Started out slow, real slow but it ended up pretty good.","Started out slow, real slow but it ended up pretty good. Overall I would recommend it if you like movies with time travel."
1,"DVD Bad ,not working suppose to be NEW",I travel alot and some times store DVD movies till I return home. I bought From Time to Time in May. I just opened it and tried to play it. It's bad it won't play it has scratches I think it had been used.I am very disappointed and unsatisfied.Sharon
3,Not quite what I expected,"I purchased this book for the study of planes, however that section was so complex and seemed to have no reason to justify shadows and improving composition. However, the drawing exercies are very helpful and beneficial."
5,Aloha kua!,"Last summer, I bumped into Ledward Ka'apana at Chili's. As I extended my hand I said, ""Led, you da kine numbah one geetar picker, fo shoa."" Led then proceeded to sit down at our table and talk story for a little while, before returning to his friends at another table. That's the kind of guy he is; a great soul who completely embodies the Aloha spirit.This album is an absolute must-have for anyone interested in island music, as well as anyone who loves to hear guitar played by a true master. This live recording gives a great feel of not only the man's music, but also of the man himself as he communicates with the audience. Stories of the islands and the songs, and jokes illustrate the gentle good humor of the islands and after listening to this recording, I feel as though I've been on vacation to the place I love. Hawaiian music could have no better ambassador than Ledward Ka'apana and it's a joy to hear him recorded in a live venue."
1,Dont Buy,This is the worst movie I've seen. There is just one short lesbian scene with kissing(...).
5,Perfect product.,"The best price on the internet I could find was here at Amazon. Now after researching other places the description here doesn't tell you the most important thing this does come with 2 pieces for your complete front. I know most would already know that, but I was worried a bit at first. Also it does come with the wrench for the bottom of the shock area so that is a plus.As always fast shipping and product came in perfect condition."
4,We Like It!,"It's Hamburger Helper. What can you say? You either like it or you don't. We do. It's not exactly like homemade, but for a quick meal when you're in a hurry, it's okay. The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink. These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal. Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty! I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get. Hope this helps!"
1,Don't buy,"When I received the product, It was freight damaged. I was told by the vendor that it would be replaced or credited. They never did. I would never buy anything from this vendor again"
1,Noisy pump!,I'm sending this back as the pump is very loud--louder than my refrigerator when it's struggling...
4,Give me more Cochran/Deveraux Stories,"I was a bit skeptical when I bought this book because I thought it was going to be a cheesy romance novel, but no, it was far from it. I love that Benita (Bennie) is a power woman with A-type personality. She reminds me of myself. She is gracious, poise, a hardworker, self-sufficient but knows when to let a man lead and when she needs to step up. Clayton sounds like he is the most beautiful man ever. Both of them come from families that have built their legacies through hardwork and it shows. I love that both of them weren't pretentious or stuckup. They seemed like very down to earth people. There is a cliff hanger in this story that involves Bennie's father, Big Benny. LEt's just say this family's story doesn't stop there."
5,LUCKY IN LOVE,"THIS WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK. I FOUND MYSELF SO CAUGHT UP IN THE BOOK THAT I FINISHED IT IN ONE DAY. IF BET EVER WANTS TO KNOW WHAT BOOK SHOULD BECOME A MOVIE, I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE."
2,You can find better elsewhere,"This is just your average, cheap, plastic wastecan. The color really didn't have anything metallic about it. The lid is quite a pain to use (the opening is just not large enough), so finally I threw away the lid & and now am just using the base. If I had it to do over, I would not purchase this again."
3,Not Very High Quality -- Lid Comes Off,"I needed a swing top can to keep my cat out of the trash because she eats anything and everything including cotton, fur and plastic bags. I thought this would be very handy to toss things that are small when I walk by and to keep them out of her mouth! I love the way the opening sways as it is very easy to dispose of lightweight items; that said, it does not serve the purpose I had hoped because the lid absolutely refuses to stay on the bottom securely. When you take it off to empty it you try and try to get it to fit securely to the base and it just stays loose. Very frustrating. Any small jarring or movement makes the entire lid come right off -- if my kitty does this, well, she'll have a feast of entirely inedible things. This was for her safety so I regret not getting one that would be more sturdy."
1,What a waste!,"This product is made from flimsy plastic and the lid will NEVER fit properly -- it's constantly falling off. In fact, the wastebasket is top-heavy and falls over easily, spilling its contents all over the floor. Can I return this useless item? Or get my money back?"
2,"Umbra Eco-Friendly 2.5-Gallon Sway Can, Metallic Ocean",The size and color are great but the lid is very easily knocked off which has been pretty frustrating for us.
4,Work gloves,"Very strong durable gloves. I have used other brands of gloves priced much higher than these gloves and have not lasted as long as these. They would wear at the palms and fingertips and become useless. These gloves are well constructed, they fit well and adjust to hug your hands. Only problem is the black dye used to color the gloves , rubs off in your hands. I did not mind."
3,Good DVD,This is a good DVD and the Violet Zaki is not an irritating coach. But I find myself going back to LaloFit instead.
2,"An OK rest, not much general support","This product provides a good rest for your hand, supporting it while laying on the desk, but does not provide much general support for your whole hand, wrist, and forearm at all times, holding them ""together"" which I prefer."
3,Precut Mat Frames,"The Pacon precut mat frames are good for quick matting of elementary school students' artwork. The mats are not of the best quality, but do put a finishing touch to student artwork you may want to display."
3,Not an easy read,Informative but not an easy book to read. Written in 1880 using quotes from the minutes of meetings.
5,An MDS monograph written for applied researchers,"It is quite hard to find easy-reading reference for MDS. Some are written in Mathematics rather than in English. Others are over comprehensive as an introductory text for laymen. In this regard, I found Kruskal and Wish's ""Multidimensional Scaling"" to be the most 'user friendly'( only in a relative sense).In short, this is certainly a monograph with just the right amount of substances for any applied researcher interested in MDS to get started with their work. Fundamental knowledge of statistics is a prerequisite, of course."
4,My new foyer piece,"My 15 yr old son wanted a telescope for Christmas. Well, dad is an ophthalmologist and knows optics... but not telescopes. I scouted & researched these things for a while & ended up getting this one based on some reviews I don't recall now. It is difficult to assemble on Christmas morning at 1 AM, stands 6 feet tall when finally assembled, takes up a 3x3ft area in my foyer, is awkward to carry down steps, and takes up a lot of room in the minivan to transport (Thank God for dust covers).The optics are great, but you must remember everything is upside-down & backwards with this scope, so adjustment as you chase stars takes some practice.I would recommend this scope for an avid star-gazer, not a beginner like me or my son...it's too much for us... but I think I saw one of those little Mission Apollo American flags stuck on the Moon once."
1,Where is it?,I ordered this item on Dec. 12th as a Christmas gift. It is now exactly 1 month later and I have not yet recieved it. Needless to say I'm getting angry about it. I will be contacting customer service soon.
3,twisted justice,it's a good movie and the main reason why I like it or got it. is because of Shannon Tweed. she is a great actress and model.
4,An excellent review of housing types,"This is certainly a book that many who deal with housing design have felt lacking from their libraries. Being an excellent review of housing types of the last century, mainlyafter modernism,it is an excellent reference book for those in need of an historical overview of housing. The categories into which the examples are divided into is logical, which helps in comparing different types of housing. It is also a pleasure to read it as the book is designed in very elegant and clear lines. Unfortunately it costs too much for me but for those who can afford it, it will be a great pleasure to own."
4,Good Expository Preaching,"As an avid admirer of Dr Schaeffer, I enjoy his work tremendously. In seeking the same level of penetrative literary excellence, I was slightly disappointed. This could only be due to the fact that these are transcripts from cassettes of teachings he delivered.Romans 2:17-29: ""What is the manifest purpose for the Scriptures?""The apostle Paul has explained, by way of progressive revelation, the plight of fallen man. The Bible alone has presented the problem of sin and God's cure for it. As Francis Schaeffer commented on this part:'Paul is simply cutting away every other foundation than grace. He is cutting away all the arguments people have used down through the ages to say: 'I don't need a Savior.' p 51The formation of God's people based on the grace received by revelation is vital, necessary against those who Paul showed were attempting to cut away the gospel foundation of grace."
3,"Good coffee, prices went up 35% in one month!",Had been receiving this coffee for one year as a standing order from Amazon. Price was steady until October. Won't buy again due to exorbitant pricing practices.
1,Horrible Customer Service at Sharp Electronics!,"I purchased my 37"" Sharp Aquos on Aug.1, 2005. After only one day, the TV died. I called Sharp to ask for a replacement and they denied my request. They said that I would have to send it off to their ""Sharp Authorized Repair Facility"", which I did. That was over one month ago and I still do not have my TV back. Sharp has not provided any assistance at all in getting my TV back from their authorized repair facility, nor can they give me any details as to the status of the repair. Today I have hired an attorney to begin litigation against Sharp. Needless to say, I will never again purchase a Sharp product!"
3,Star Wars with Magic Cats,"A man - part human, part machine -programmed to prevent emotion. A woman - raised as a resistance fighter who is ruled by instinct. An unlikely couple each of whose missing pieces are matched by the other's strengths.Add in space jumps between some kinds of alternate reality, telepaths and empaths, aliens who have infiltrated the highest ranks of interstellar governments and militaries and you have a non-stop action thriller laced with romance. Oh. Did I mention the furzels? Mystical cat-like creatures who will steal your heart even as they protect their assigned humans.Just a fabulous read. Set in some space location not associated with earth and involving space battles and technical gadgetry, Games of Command plays a game with both your head and your heart.Good writing. Tight plot. A fairly obvious beginning of a series but one that actually made me glad. I look forward to hearing more about the future of The Alliance."
3,I enjoyed the read but...,"I enjoyed reading Games of Command. However, I have to agree with some other reviews about to many love interests going on. I wish Sinclair would have focused on Kel-Paten and Sass. I also would have liked more background information on why Kel-Paten was turned into a biocybe. The action was non stop and it kept you turning pages."
5,Wonderful,"I have had these speakers for a while, and they are wonderful! They get extremely loud for the size and are very portable. The sound quality and such is great, and it is very durable-if it can withstand 8 hours in a hot/sunny nursery, then it is considered durable to me. The only two drawbacks were that the remote didn't work all that well(which wasn't that big of a problem) and the speakers seemed to shorten my battery life of the player itself. After using the speakers, my Zen's battery began to last only 4-7 hours instead of it's normal 10-12+."
2,dissappointed,Just received the traveldock. I purchased this because of it portability. I was disappointed to discover that it will not operate on battery power as claimed. Works fine on ac power however using battery power only provides a split second of audio followed by a couple of second of static then nothing. Unit came with 4 AA batteries. I replaced them with fresh batteries but the problem persists. Returning it today.
4,TravelDock Speakers for Zen Micro,"I was pleasently surprised of the sound quality from such a small devise. It has plently of volume without getting tingie. I take it to the beach, on camping trips and out in the yard. I'm glad I made this purchase."
5,A Great product,"I found the Selector 100 to be exactly what I needed. It allowed me to store a large number of CDs in a compact package that also provides me fast retrieval of my CDs. The cataloging system is very efficient and easy to use. In addition, the software, in this case a CD I ordered from the company, was easy to use. In no time I had 183 CDs loaded into two Selector 100s, and I was using them to quickly retrieve records for my CD player. This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Cute Concept... As it is With Coffee... so With Life....,"Cheung delivers a clever little book destined to be read in many coffee shops and to be perched on many coffee tables.It is not deep or far reaching in content... it is quirky, well blended and not too rich or over-boiled. (A little coffee humor for you today.)It will not win any big literary awards and may be just the thing for your coffee loving friend. Content wise, there are some gold nuggets and fun factoids in magazine like sidebars called ""The Coffee Box."""
1,Americans Eat Too Much,"The whole premise of this book is that the substance ""leptin"" makes Americans fat, which is just a cop-out for overeating! Leptin may predispose people to eating too much, but this is not the same as predetermining them to be fat!The problem with the book is it totally takes away the basic problem of Americans; eating too much food! He should have focused on the true problem of eating too much, not enough exercise and the staggering quantity of food available to us!"
3,Student,"I took an undergraduate course using this book. I have read other MK published book before and I believe the general principle for these people is... explain simple concepts using the most possible words. The book seemed padded with useless words to explain simple concepts. I had class notes to accompany the lectures and a page worth of material from the lecture notes explained much more than 30 pages from this book.However, this book does skim through various database implementation (DB2, Oracle, Ingres) and displays the differences between them.I have found this book to be impractical for reference, it is definitely a 'textbook'. If you're looking for practical SQL usage, you might want to look else where. However, if you're interested in Concepts of Database Programming and Performance Topics then this book might fulfill your needs."
2,"Adequate, but not great","I must disagree with the other reviewers. This book was recommended for a undergrad course on DBMS at UC Berkeley. The chapter on relational algebra had lots of good examples, but the book went down hill from there. The SQL examples and problems were trivial and shallow compared to the relational algebra ones. The ESQL section was pretty good, but vendors' on-line reference material made it redundant. While an overview of DBMS implementation was given, it was almost completely useless when we had to write our own DBMS from scratch. The only highlight in this section is a pretty clear example of insertions into a B+ Tree (even though the book calls it a B tree ). All in all I cannot recommend this book."
5,Great resource on Presidents,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is participating in the Academic Games competitions on U.S. Presidents. This book is very thorough and has an easy format to follow and gives great details into the lives of the Presidents. I have found the information in here easy to read, as my daughter is in 4th grade and can read it. It is also very interesting. The book I received only goes up to Bill Clinton... but it is more than adequate information on all of the previous presidents. Great resource for anything you need to know about our Presidents."
1,One Star Reviews of Twilight Are More Interesting to Read Than the Book Itself,"As I said....I had more hysterical fun reading the one star reviews of this book than I did reading the actual book. It is so laughably, horribly, awfully bad. Its incomprehensible how it was published. It isn't even fun trash novel reading. The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is non-existent, and the writing...oh God the writing...Edward is constantly ""smirking"" and letting out ""low chuckles"" (the low chuckles...oh I'm laughing hysterically again...there must have been at least six of those in the first few chapters alone). Like most poor writers who can't set up and tell a story with any narrative skill, she relies on endless (and repetitive) adverbs and dialogue tags to describe the story.Amazon one star reviewers....thanks for the laughs."
5,Forbidden vampires,"Who doesn't love a cute, intriguing, forbidden vampire? If you read the first page, you won't put it down. I read night and day, I was hooked and couldn't get enough. Meyer's writing drew me in like no other book. I was in the story; I was Bella and couldn't get enough of her life. Every book just added fuel to my want for this world. As soon as I opened one book I was thrust into another world until I closed the book."
5,My so far favorit of the series,"Like everyone else, I have not read Breaking Dawn yet, since it have not been released yet. However, Twilight is my favorit out of the three I read so far.It was really funny how I got to this book! I have never heard of the Twilight Saga or Stefanie Meyer before. Walmart had this book on sale and I was out of reading material, so I just grabed it, without reading what it was about. When I started reading I was not very confinced of the book, because I found the first few chapters to be boring. However, once I got into it, I was unable to put it back down and had to order the other two books here from amazon and read them as well... I got through with all three in one week!"
5,Enough for Forever,"This book blew me away! It's been a very long time since a book really did that. If I don't have to go to work, I will lock myself in my room just to keep reading and re-reading! I thought it would be like Interview with Vampire thing but nope, it's MORE than that.Meet Edward, a young vampire with gorgeous face aand stylish suit and his interesting family. The descriptions of what a vampire is and its myth were not the usual stuff. I LOVE him :). And Bella, the strong-voiced teenage girl who unintentionally attracted Edward in a chilling way. She is like everyday girl with everyday problems but with a good wit. The scene of their encounters are still playing in my mind ::daydreaming:: They're not full of great dialogs but the passion and feeling conveyed wrapped me totally that I don't ever want it to end."
4,Pretty Good,"It's done pretty well, but the girl that does Bella's voice just does not sound right.... I am not sure what it is and it's not because it's not Kristen Stewart (who is a questionable ""Bella"" to begin with....)."
5,addictive,"The book starts slow, so it took me a while to get into it, but as as it picked up i as hooked to the whole series. I just had to know what happened next with each book."
5,The best book I have read in a long time.,"Wow. I haven't felt this way about a book in such a long time i was so surprised that the book was able to draw me in so quickly! I really couldn't put it down, and almost had it taken away from me at school twice. I think we all have that side of us that wishes something like this would happen to us, i know i do! I really can't describe how happy i am to have found this book, and I'm looking forward to getting the second book tomorrow!"
4,Twilight book,What a great book in the series. I love how this describes everything in so much detail.
4,Satisfied!,"I love the looks of the book! I have read it already, so I can only recommend for others to read it aswell. I promise you will fall inlove! What I am dissapointed of is that the first chapter of Midnight Sun isn't in the collector's edition and I hoped it would. Very dissapointing.."
2,"Interesting story, but overrated","I applaud the author on her success, but I was not won over by the storyline. It was ho hum - I admit, it is not my style, although I do have a love for traditional or literary horror. I just feel this is a bit overrated."
1,What I expected...,"To put it straight, this was a horible book, and was exactly what I expected. The reason for this is mainly because of the writing style and the plot. the writing style made the book very hard to visualize. I can normally read a page in about 15 to 40 seconds but this book brought it up to 40 to 100 because of lousy visualizing. Please...end...this...tourture...! Secondly, the only thing that SM actually described was how beutiful that vampire guy was. I actually forgot his name! Oh, and the plot was garbage too. Sereously, who wants to hear about some teenagers love affair with a vampire who is trying to protect her from other killer/evil/rapist vampires. And the only people in my grade were the girls in my class with the lowest grades and one perverted boy I know. If you want a good book read the Inehertance Cycle by Christofer Paoloni.PS...excuse my bad spelling"
1,You might gag!,"This poorly-written piece of juvenile fiction is tailored to 12 and 13-year-old girls. It's all about ""his gleaming eyes,"" ""his crooked smile,"" and on and on. Don't expect any logic, either. The main character is a girl who has moved from her old school,where she never had a boyfriend, to a new school, where the guys can't leave her alone. And the logic goes downhill from there. But hey, since when did pre-adolescents need their fiction to make sense? If you're an adult, don't waste your time or money on this."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book combines all of the elements of a disastrous fanfic into one. You have the Mary Sue with the ridiculous name whom all the boys worship and adore, the ~angelic~ hero whose stunning good looks should more than make up for his misogynistic personality, a plethora of recycled adjectives and adverbs, and a handful of vampires for good measure. To compare the Twilight series to Harry Potter, or basically any series with a decent plot and characters that one can actually relate to, is a humongous insult."
2,What happened to vampire lore?,"I am a huge fan of vampire stories. I'm open for some liberty with vampire lore, but this one takes the cake. This story is primarily about vampires, it's about vampire families, and about what happens to them. However, why have a vampire story when you eliminate all the primary things that make a vampire a vampire? The story drags until about the last third of the book. I also doubt that an 80+ year old vampire would find a young, 17 year old, barely understanding who she is attractive? She is only slightly appealing as a character, and I guess just not worth getting too involved in. I wonder how the movie adaptation is going to try and make up for the sorely lacking story line and lore?"
5,this book deserves WAY more than only five stars!,"I read Twilight for a book report because one of my best friends loved the book. I borrowed her copy for the book report. I now think that this is the BEST BOOK EVER! Stephenie meyer is an incredible author! I think that Bella andEedward are really funny at times, but they also make you just want to keep reading and keep reading forever. I don't know how I am going to be able to till fall 2007 when the next book, Eclipse, comes out!"
4,Reluctant then surprised,"Stephanie Myers is a fantastic writer. Even if, as a guy, you're reluctant because of the subject matter, her writing makes it worth it."
5,Enthralled!!,"Stephanie Meyer has deffinitely got my attention with her book Twighlight. The book was originally recommended by my 13 year old, and to be honest, I didn't expect to enjoy it. Vampires, blood and gore are not typically my idea of a joyful read. To my surprise, however, I am in love with these characters that Ms. Meyer presents so perfectly. I find myself more and more drawn to a vampire who wishes he wasn't, and a human who finds herself a little on the outside of normal. If you haven't read this book, find a copy now! And while you're at it, buy the sequel. You won't want to have to wait long to continue the story!!"
1,disappointing series,"I have read all 4 books in this series and I would not recommend them to anyone. I am 36 yrs old and this series is for the young adult crowd so maybe I am too old to enjoy it. I found the main character Bella so annoying I had a hard time reading the books. The story took a strange direction in the last book (I thought way too out there for teens). I read the books because I saw a preview for the Twilight movie which I hope is not as bad as the books. I recommend checking them out from your local library before you waste your money. Just a side note- this is the only time I have ever written a review about books or anything, that is how bad I thought the books were."
5,Twilight,Twilight was one of the best books I have ever read. I read constantly and Stephanie Myers grabs your attention within the first couple of pages in this book. For those of us who are not teenagers it brings you back to you High School days. This book along with the other three in this series should receive more than 5 stars in my opinion.
2,twilight review,"Twilight the book is not a great book in my opinion. Thankfully I tried one more the next book in the series and it got better and I now am finishing up the rest.This book in the series is extremely childish and for a more seasoned reader it would probably be a complete bore.This is the perfect book for a teenager I guess, but I dont remember being that silly back then!Anyways, if you buy make sure to go ahead and try the second book - I like it alot better the heroine doesnt act so annoying and the hero is alot better!"
1,I can sum it up neatly,Twlight is like reading a fanfiction.Lovers of Mary-Sues who don't like to think too hard will enjoy this.
4,Not a bad read,"I enjoyed this book on my Kindle. I must admit the book is a lot better than the movie. The character of Edward & Bella is much better in this book than on the screen. I found the book and story line a little slow in the middle particularly the romancing of the two main characters (then again, I am a male). I feel this was omitted in the movie. I have purchased all the other books by Stehpanie and I will enjoy reading them on my Kindle. His book was easily read on my Kindle. Well done Amazon and keep up the good work. Buy this Kindle book, it`s wrth the relaxing read. A well written book."
5,underage readers in mind,"I truly enjoyed the book. In the series, there are few very graphic sex scenes with violent undertones and the dialog in the book says that the violence is actually understood and accepted. But I love the series."
4,hmm,"totally sucked in by the series. though it is very predictable, it reads like every girl's dream. thus the money spending to read the books(more like skim the unnecessary blocks of text, to the main points). i've read 3 in 2 days so not quite sure what plot lies in which book, but her ideas are definitely NOT original. plot spoiler...but werewolves and vampires being foes? definitely not new. she is no jk rowling, but she knows how to play to the audience's love for dramatic romance and fantasy."
5,Amazing Book,"The first three books in the Twilight series took my breath away. They have a hypnotic way of addicting you to them; once you start, you can't stop. Sadly, if you do enjoy Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, I have to warn you to not read Breaking Dawn. It screwed the entire series up for me. Stop at Eclipse, and call it a day."
5,Thirsting for More,"This book caught me by surprise. I bought this book for my 15 year-old niece months ago. She told me it was her favorite book ever. Recently Breaking Dawn came out and all the Meyer books have been on display. I decided to read Twilight and find out what all the hoopla was about. Having never read a vampire book before, I was skeptical. I started the book and could NOT put it down. I absolutely loved it. I now have New Moon waiting on my nightstand. This book is for anyone who wants a great, fast-paced book. As an adult woman, I was surprised at how sensual the relationship was between Bella and Edward without ever having sex. I highly recommend this one. Hopefully all the rest will be just as good."
2,not what I expected,Have to agree with the others....the book goes on and on page after page of the same ol thing. Nothing really changes....gets boring.. I am on page 387 and struggling to finish it. I think I'm ready to pass it on to someone else and see what they think. Don't think I'll waste my money on the rest of the sequel.
5,couldn't help but keep reading,"Make sure you have a lot of time to read because once you start, it's hard to stop. I didn't think it would be as good as it was...If you are looking for something besides pure entertainment then maybe this isn't really what you want. It is pure fun to read."
5,definately worth reading,"I absolutely loved the series. I teach middle school and the girls and I have intelligent discussions every day about this series. Anything that gets kids reading is worth it to me.I thought the storyline flowed perfectly from book to book. As an adult, I always read what the kids are reading and this series was great. Maybe my mind is still stuck in 8th grade and that is why it appealed to me, but I think it is well worth the time to read the series.Since I am not an author, I refuse to criticize Mrs. Meyer's writing style. It keeps kids interested. Thats all that needs to be said!"
5,Great YA book for young women,"Even in my 20's, this was a great read. It is well written, and has a lot of depth while still being fun to read."
1,Just awful....,"This book is awful. Bella is probably one of the weakest female characters written in the past twenty years. Her relationship with Edward entirely overwhelms her will and her personality. For a smart girl, she makes bad decision after bad decision. From the beginning of their relationship, Edward is vaguely paternal, which is a bit creepy. The reason vampires don't go in the sun is absurd. Want an excellent vampire romance? Try Robin McKinley's Sunshine. Twilight pales in comparison to Sunshine, a novel that really sparkles (all puns intended!)."
5,Engaging and Enjoyable!,"I'll be the first to admit; I'm a sucker for romance. I loved this book, though I will admit Bella's somewhat 'lack of purpose' before Edward is puzzling, though not very necessary. The plot is, in my view, original, interesting and flows smoothly, gaining pace as it moves on. The writing is descriptive and engaging. Overall, a great, enjoyable read with creative, interesting characters."
4,Good,"I do not usually read YA, but with the movies and all the hype I decided to try this one. The story held my interest. I enjoyed reading the book, but not sure I'll read the rest in the series. It just doesn't measure up to what I prefer to read."
5,Best Book of 2005,Others have said what all the amazing things are about this book. It's wonderfully crafted and truly entertaining. Ditto that for the two sequels as well. Kudos to this first-time author!
2,Reading level is for kids in grade 7-11...,"As a college student, I am surprised grown-ups are crazed over this book. I read it and I wasn't impressed. The beginning is too tedious and long. The only good part was the ending. The reading level is sad and would be the perfect book for a girl age 14 or an immigrant learning the english language. I am shocked to see adults crazed over it. Very sad. The movie was terrible too."
1,This is very poor,I tried very hard to read this book in an attempt to understand what the hype was about. It is long. Almost 500 pages. The characters are inconsitent and there's no plot. Frankly I was so bored that I gave up after 300 pages. And thus I still don't know what all the hype is about.
1,stick to the classics,i didnt really like this book. or any of the books in the saga for that matter ... i read this book only because ihad about five people tell me that i needed to read it. i tore through it but then i realized the writing was a big pile of rubbish. this book and its collection are directed at screaming girls who love taylor and rob.... i say that anyone whos looking for a great mythical fantasy creatures should stick to the classics...
1,huge huge disappointment,"i was one of the many victims of this horrid craze. i forced myself to read it based on suggestion of coworker who fawned over the writing style; i was lied to. the story was extremely boring, and the style monotonous. the story kept building as if some cool battle would happen, but alas, it ended as it began with me struggling to stay awake."
1,"Bad, bad, and more bad","There is not a lot about the story that I can say that hasn't been said. Poor writing and plot structure aside, Bella is weak, uninspiring and doesn't portray a strong woman. Instead, once she meets Edward -- a glittery, morally-torn vampire -- she becomes entirely dependent on him. Even though much of his actions and her reactions are classic signs of an abusive relationship. Is this really the kind of message our teens ans tweens should be learning? I find it really sad that this is as popular as it is. of course, the Twihards won't listen to this criticism. They will just call us names and claim we are jealous or something. A sad state of affairs that modern day discussions have come to that. Hopefully, they will see the light when they get older."
4,fast paced and well done,"Twilight is a very good debut novel. The characters are realistic (that is within the fantasy setting, of course!), and the story pulls you along. Bella is a very believable young woman / teenager with normal teenage angst. Her klutziness is the perfect opposite of Edward's silky smooth movements. While I would prefer a book have a teenage heroine who for a change is NOT captivated by Jane Austen, her personality and outsider status in the community dovetail nicely into just why she would be so attracted to him.Well told without overtly graphic violence, this is a step in age above the early Harry Potter novels but should be enjoyed by fans of that series. I haven't read the rest of the series yet but look forward to doing so after enjoying this one very much."
5,Wonderful,I purchased Twilight and New Moon at the same time. I devoured both books in record time and anxiously await the third in the wonderful trilogy.
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"When I first read a review, my gaze was drawn to the word ""vampire."" I was skeptical, but when a group of girls in my school who had read the book told me I HAD to read it, I gave in.I am so glad I did. This book is amazing. The characters are intriguing. The plot is mesmerizing. I highly reccommed this book to anyone, male or female."
5,"Best book ever, page turner, loved it!","It recommend this book to everyone it a big page turner. Read it you will love it!I could read it over and over. Amazing theme, about love, trust and much more. Best book I've ever read in my life. Read it!"
5,Makes me wish vampires were real,"My mom bought this for me in Target on our trip from Virginia to New York. I finished it in two days and it left me wanting more. The characters were so amazing and remind me of people in real life and Meyer gave them a half realistic problems to battle with and I found that very interesting. I don't know if I am the only one, but I felt kind of left hanging by the end, leaving me to wonder what would happen next. I am hoping there will be a sequel to Twilight to fill in the blanks for me. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helps you."
2,This is probably a good novel if ........,"your only reading is Harlequin romance novels. For the rest of us, it's not really mind-bending reading. Bella andEdward spend most of their time gazing into each others eyes, and moaning about how they can't stand being apart.Why Bella is not more freaked out by the presence of vampires is unsettling. What's wrong with this girl?? And why is she so lovesick over a guy who is constantly 'smirking','chuckling', and 'snickering'??? It's bad enough that teenage girls are going so gaga over this book-at least they have the prospect of developing more discerning tastes as they mature; but to here adult women swooning over this book is very disheartening."
1,als;dfhla,"Just no. I loved it first time except for new moon and breaking dawn. Then I tried to read it again and I realized its poorly written and the only thing that I loved the first time was Edward and his love with Bella. Then people started wearing TEAM EDWARD and TEAM JACOB tshirts. It makes me gag, you didnt see people doing that with jane austen, tolkien or dan brown. Cant people just accept a good book and not ruin it for all the sane humans who dont cry over how beautiful edward is. Also, the movies are TERRIBLE. I think I might still like twlight to this day if people didnt make it an obsession. Its like Uggs. I loved them because I was one of the first to get them in my school and they were comfortable. Then everyone had a pair of brown Uggs and I dont like to wear them. For the teenage girl who is reading this, don't buy this and maybe be a little different and not blend in. Blending in will get you no where in life."
2,"Terrible, terrible writing","This series is very redundant (even within each book). There are bits and pieces that move the plot - and I'm being generous with the word plot, but the majority of each book really is the same lines over and over and over...and over again."
4,Silly Fun,"I wish there was a 3 1/2 star rating.This book was a silly, fun romp. I have read the whole saga now, and while I have to say this was the most poorly written (how many times exactly do we have to hear that his face is like an angel? we get it already! and Bella, sheesh, grow a spine...) it is still fun, and the one that I re-read when I just need a detour into romantic frivolity. Bella's can be a little too snotty and patronizing towards her Dad sometimes (could be oversensitive since I have a teen girl...) but overall, this is fun, escapist fantasy."
4,another Twilgiht fan,"I liked the book very much, maybe even better than the movie because you could get inside the characters' heads better. Great fiction if you like the genre."
5,"Heart Stopping, Amazing!","I don't think I've ever loved a character so much. I honestly have no idea how Stephenie Meyer does it, but she will make you want every boy out there to be like Edward Cullen. Including the fact that he's a vampire!!!Amazing. Only way to describe it!Oh - and if you haven't read this book yet, you're crazy! Stop whatever you're doing right now and start it!!!"
1,boring,All I can say is that this is one boring book. I couldn't get into it at all. It is still unfinished and will stay that way; snooze fest
1,An Addictive Marshmallow,"Twilight is the story of the seemingly impossible love between an every day girl and a gorgeous mysterious stranger, who happens to be a 108 years old vampire. Although hardly an original premise, the huge success of this series shows how appealing the idea of forbidden love is, especially for young girls.I must confess I was just as caught up as everybody else while reading it. Yet overall I found it deeply unsatisfying. Twilight glorifies a kind of romantic love that is not only unrealistic but sets the stage for abuse.Literary speaking, Twilight is like a huge marshmallow: fluffy and sweet and addictive, yet hardly nutritious and, eaten in excess, bad for you."
5,Twilight,Was very hesitant about this book but had to see what the hype was allabout and truly enjoyed it! I would recommend this book it's a good read. I could not waitto start book 2
4,Twilight,Good bookI will read it over and over again.Will read the rest of the book before reading it over and over again.
5,"Be warned, very addictive!","I just finished reading the twighlight series about a week ago and I've got to say, wow! I was a bit skeptical, I had heard from many women how great these books are but being a bit of a rebel and not much of a romance fan I figured that these books would not interest me. I had also heard from some people that they felt that they weren't written well. I began reading and started out determined to be critical, that changed to interest, then to intrigue, and then full on addiction, I loved them. Although a romance, I felt that there was enough interest for any women, including myself. Put aside any critical review of her writing style (as the book was written for teenagers) the story is very creative and entertaining. I'm excited for the next book."
3,I don't get it.,"I don't understand the great reviews that this book has gotten. I am afraid it shows the level to which criticism of novels has fallen. It starts out okay but quickly denigrates to talkiness. Talk,talk, talk about how dangerous Edward is. Talk, talk, talk about how attracted they are to each other. The book was a yawn by halfway through. It is OKAY. That's the best I can say about it. However, that being said, I am not a teenager. Maybe they are cool with any book concerning a love story about a vampire and a teenage girl. But I have read many books for teens such as Donna Jo Napoli's which are exquisite. So... good is good, and mediocre is medicre."
1,XP Twilight,"A simplistic book. It seems to capture readers, as it did me, when they start reading the series. But once done with it, when you step back and look at it as a whole, you see it could have been a one hundred page book and not interfere with the plot at all. I find it a bad book, simply because of the repetition. But I do like it because it actually encourages young adults to read. Unfortunately, after reading this book, they seem to become obsessed with it, and don't look beyond it to the wider range of literature by more experienced authors."
1,The watery vampires,"Bella Swan hates leaving sunny Phoenix for rainy, gloomy forks, where her estranged and not so much beloved father lives. Yet she does it, for reasons never adequately cleared. Maybe she's a masochist. She's rather dull, but all the kids in town love her, save the scion of a vampire family who happens to loathe her. Obviously, this is only the beginning of this soupy, soapy novel, better named ""My boyfriend is a teenage vampire"". Vegetarian, goody-goody vampires at that, who happily admit Bella in her midst, but beware of the evil vampires!Now, what amount of silliness can this story hold? All you can ever want, apparently. I'm not particularly fond of vampire stories, but if you are, read Burying the Shadow by Storm Constantine or the St Germain's-Victoria Clemens saga by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, not this watery drivel."
1,Please don't,"I'm begging you, don't read this drivel. There are many better YA options out there (try Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy). I read the entire saga and seriously wished I hadn't. I don't know how I can emphasize just how terrible and poorly written this series was. Even as a guilty pleasure, I wouldn't recommend it. How it managed to become so popular is beyond me.Don't do it. You'll regret it later."
1,This Ain't no Harry Potter,"When I originally heard about this series, I was like cool another Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But instead there is this insipid girl risking her life for so called love. The casual way she risk her life is misleading and dangerous, I was totally underwhelmed. I literally read the book out of stubborness and boredom but I was repulsed by the simpleness of Bella. To me it seems to encourage suicide."
5,So addictive,"I could not put this book down. I can't tell you exactly why I was addicted, but I was!! I loved it all. It kept me turning pages all the way through and I can't wait to get my hands on book two. Way to go Stephenie Meyer!"
3,a good read for the teens,"I started to read this out of curiosity, thinking it's for young teenagers, which I'm not. I was ready to give up on it a third of the way through but managed to finish as the writer makes it all plausible as to how a human girl can knowingly fall in love with an unhuman vampire. I give the author credit for that. It's a unique plot, and I was looking for something different to read.It is for teenagers, I would even say young teens, in fact any kid 8 to 12 years old, and I felt that Ms. Meyer knows her audience well, and that's why she's so successful."
4,"Well-written, but slow paced...","I heard all about how poorly-written this book is supposed to be, but I didn't find it that way, and I'm particular about grammar and syntax. Stephenie Meyer has a degree in literature, and it shows, although the pacing could definitely be a little more concise. I enjoyed the book, but then I again I enjoy all those old gothic romances from the 1960's and 1970's."
5,"Mystical, yet inviting...","I enjoyed this book throughly. It takes place in a time that everyone can relate to---high school. It was well written, but a little to detailed in some places. It could be edited a little to make it shorter, but overall it was a nice, intriguing read. I generally don't like vampire books, but this one was great!"
3,WHO LOVES YOU BABY?,"The Persian RugYOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. ALL ARTISTS AND PERFORMERS KNOW IT. THE ONES PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF, ANYWAY. MISS MYER KNOWS HER AUDIENCE AND THAT IS WHY SHE HAS ONE. FANTASTIC BOY, MEETS GIRL AND THEN A MORE DANGEROUS FANTASTIC GUY WANTS HER FOR HIS PURPOSES. YOUNG GIRLS LOVE A FANTASTIC LOVE STORY AND IF THERE CAN BE MAGIC, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY AND SOMETHING RIDICULOUS TO DREAM ABOUT THAT SEEMS TO BE A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS IN THIS GENRE AND AGE GROUP. IF I TOOK ADVICE ONLY FROM THE VERY SUCCESSFUL THEN I WOULD TALK TO THIS AUTHOR. THIS AUTHOR HAS AN AUDIENCE AND I KNOW QUITE LITERATE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THESE BOOKS. I ALSO KNOW PRACTICALLY ILLITERATE PEOPLE WHO LOVE IT AS WELL AND CAN READ IT. ANY BOOK THAT CAN INSPIRE KIDS TO READ IS GREAT. EVERY BOOK DOESNT HAVE TO BE ON THE LEVEL OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS OR THE PERSIAN RUG. DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS, BUT LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE LOVE THIS BOOK."
5,My New Favorite Book,"I only started reading this book because I heard people talking about it, however, once I started it I loved it. One day into it I had read 100 pages. Two days into it I had posters for it all over my room. Now I am on New Moon which is slightly slower than Twilight but still good enough to spend seven hours strate reading it. I think that if you do not read this novel to at least try it you must not know the definition of a good book."
5,Fantastic book!!!!,"I just finished to read this book and I did it in just 2 days! I read it in Italian because it was translated even in my language but can't wait for ""New Moon"" to be translated so I think I'm going to read it in english!!!I found it very interesting and couldn't put it down!You can't resist Edward's charm and, once in a lifetime after reading a love story, you don't wish to be a princess to share your life with the prince charming but deeply desire to be a vampire to share the eternity with the most handsome vampire in the book!!!!"
1,Mary Sue got published.,"To put it succinctly, I'm amazed this book got published in the first place. The copy editor must have been asleep when they read this one, because the book is very poorly written and could have been much better if someone had bothered to go through it with a red pen before it was published. I've read much better written Mary Sue fan fiction that had a better plot and better characterization than this novel, not to mention less saccharine melodrama.If, like me, you're going to read ""Twilight"" at the behest of friends, check it out of the local library and save your money and the wasted paper stock. If the sappy Mary Sue schtick winds up being your thing after all, then order the whole series and enjoy."
5,=),Let me just say first of THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS.I love the way Meyer puts a whole new spin on vampires and and gives them a whole new reputation.Now I kind of just started reading and it usually takes me like 4-5 days to finish a 300pg book but this I just couldn't put down and I finished it in a day and a half. Just utterly amazing is all I have to say about this book.
4,Characters are compelling,"I'm 30 and I started reading the series after 2 of my other adult friends recommended them. This isn't Harry Potter with all the wizards, magic, quidditch, and Lord Voldemort. But, it is a compelling young adult series, nonetheless. I think these books have done well because she writes the main characters well and keeps the reader rooting for all of them. The series isn't driven by a lot of action or vampire bloodfests, but rather a budding romance between a human and her non-human suitors; she references ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Wuthering Heights"" a lot.If you're older and want good ""fluff"" reading, try out this series."
3,I will be reading the next one....,"This is a romance novel plain and simple...a good one, but one none the less. I heard several mothers of teenage daughters talking about reading his book and since I really did enjoy the Harry Potter series I decided it was worth the read just to be up on teenage trends. It was a very light and easy read. I did enjoy it but it is mindless. Everyone is so perfect and the love so strong and deep it conquers all. If I were a teenage girl I would LOVE this, so I can see the appeal."
4,Novel for Young readers,"I ordered this based on reviews. I read through the first one rather quickly because when I received it it looked like many of the novels that I as an adult read and it was a pretty large book. Maybe they could have divided up this book a bit more and make threee books out of the two in this series so far. My neice was very intimidated by the size of this book, but the writing is lovely and there is no sex, so parents don't have to worry. The author stresses the good role models and doesn't glorify the bad apples. Stephanie Meyer did good."
1,What do people see in this?,Twilight is officially one of the top 5 WORST books I've ever read. Poorly written. One dimensional characters. Edward is a controlling jerk with no personality. Their relationship has no substance. Meyers writes like she has a word bank of SAT words that she's determined to force into the text. BLECH!
5,MY NEW FAVORITE EVER!,"This book is my new favorite, and I read a lot of books. It was totally, completely amazing! A definite must read."
2,Disappointed after seeing movies,"This is the first time I've read a book after seeing the movie, so it is a bit difficult. But, this first book, in my opinion is not really very well written. I'm halfway thru the 3rd book right now. Her descriptive writing is really not very good and I found myself skipping over words and knowing I didn't miss a thing. Did I feel like a lot was missing from the movie? Not at all. Quite frankly, being on the 3rd book, my feeling is that her writing is much better on screen than in type. I always had a problem with the 90-year-old and a 16 or 17-year-old. At least this 1st book gives an explanation for both their behaviors that makes sense to me. However, it paints a picture of Bella that totally makes no sense and does not jibe with the movie character I remember. Anyways, I was a big Interview With a Vampire et al. fan, but not really here. This is fun and very quick reading. Two stars because I don't think you should expect a lot."
4,Saved by Edward,"If not for Edward, I would have given this book 2 stars. But as it is, I read Twilight and enjoyed because of him.I found Bella terribly annoying. I got so frustrated with her because she did such stupid things, like following the boys who she even thought looked dangerous and up to no good. Just silly.I liked the push and pull attraction between Bella and Edward. It was what one of the things done well in a book that could stand to lose about 150 pages of narrative that did nothing for the story.Will I read on? From what I can tell from the movies -- of which I've only seen the first one -- I truly doubt it. While I enjoyed and finished this one, one book is about all I can take of two characters and their romance."
1,Reading is not narration,"I have not read the book yet as I often prefer to listen in my car. The reading of this book is horrendous, Ilyana Kadushin has no business calling herself a narrator. I have heard better cadence, rythm and melody in high school valedictorian addresses. It is incredibly distracting. The story is compelling enough but I can only listen in five minute increments due to the below amateurish voice stylings of Ilyana Kadushin."
4,Not My Favorite of the Series,"Although I am absolutely in love with the Twilight series, I wish I had written this review before I read the other 3 books, because in comparison it is really not that great. I ADORED the other three, this one felt more like a necessary step to them to establish main characters and relationships. Not a BAD read by any means, just not my fav. I think it especially makes Edward look bad, he's pretty much a jerk through almost the entirety of the book, even though you're made to understand why... Then again I've always been team Jacob..."
2,Not at all a vampire story,"If you want to read a fairly good love story you can read this book. If you want to read a awfully good book about vampires read ""Out of the Night"" by Robin T. Popp.Now that you know that this isn't a really vampire's story if you like mushy love stories you can read this one."
3,Perfect for its target audience,"Just finished reading twilight because I wanted to see what it's about before watching the movie, and I must say I was dissapointed. It goes around the same things for way too long and only picks up pace at the end. I was really annoyed at the constant remarks saying how hot is Edward. If this girl is willing to sacrifice herself for someone who wants to have her for breakfast, there has to be a lot more that physical atraction!On the other hand I have to give the author props for setting up a story that really appeals to its target demographic; I personally prefer books that anyone can enjoy."
5,Magic!,After reading the 1 star reviews I came to understand that some are simply unable to believe in magic. This author touches the top hat and prose flow into open hearts.
5,Better than the movie.,"I hadn't read the books before isaw the movies. But this was great at explaining overlooked details from the movies... like alice's past, etc. I loved the background info. Im excited to start new moon!"
1,An Insult to Literature,"And that's really all I have to say. This book was a huge disappointment for all I heard about it, completely with dismal one dimensional characters and a loose plot and complete sexism. Belle is a complete moron and I figured if I read one more word about how 'perfect' Edward Cullen is, I was going to just set the book on fire.A mockery of literature. I can't believe this got published and became popular when there are millions of better things that could've been in it's place that didn't absolutely suck."
5,Twilight is among the best young adult novels ever written,"Twilight is a gripping novel that captivates people of all kinds. Meyer sweeps her readers off their feet and really gets them into the book; she makes everything so believable and real. Fantasy, adventure, sci-fi, and fiction all wrapped up into one heck of a novel that readers of all sorts will love. Meyer has outdone herself with this one."
3,Vampire in the high school!,This book surprised me. I really thought the backgroud of high school life was not exciting...This book will definitely appeal to a younger group. It did hold my interest as it took in the mores of the native peoples in the area...That was educational.
5,The greatest suspense/romance novel ever!,"I am so in love with this series! I've devoured the first two books already and have just ordered the third. My teenage sister recommended it to me and I thought it may be too young for a 33 year old, but I am hooked."
