3,Excellent & Razor Sharp,"I mainly carry this knife on weekends. It has remained extremely sharp after a fair amount of use. The speed safe mechanism works great and I don't expect to have any issues. The tip is a little thin and could snap off if used improperly, but I don't plan to use it as a screw driver....that's what screw drivers are for.Edit: After using the knife regularly for a for the past month, the thin blade is starting to take a beating. I've been what I would consider overly cautious of how I use it and the blade is starting to show some jaggedness to it. I'm knocking off 2 stars because of the fragility of the blade."
5,This Knife is Awesome!,"I have had had several Kershaw knifes, and this one meets Kershaw's usual quality. Its simplicity goes hand in hand with its resilient design which allows you to carry it wherever you need to and it's rigged and straight edge combo allows you to rip or slice whatever you're working on. I would recommend this knife to anyone."
5,Awesome Knife,"RAZOR sharp, I was very pleased with the edge of this knife right out of the box. I purchased the serrated version, and the serrated blade cut through cardboard easier than butter. Be aware, at first it may be a bit stiff to open, but after oping and closing it for a little while, it was no longer a problem. 5 stars for quality, price, and shipping (it was short)!"
5,Great Knife,This knife is fantastic and I really enjoy it. I carry it every day with me and use it at work when I have to work in the stock room to cut open boxes. Be careful it is razor sharp. I cut myself by accident. I also shaved a patch of hair off of my arm with it to prove how sharp it is.
1,"Great knife, but poor quality","I got this knife and took it camping a couple of days later. While camping I was cutting through some rope and the serrated blade had one of the ""serrated bumps"" break clean off. They were cheap and flimsy, not like the ones in the picture.I talked to the customer service of the people who shipped it to me and they were super helpful. They explained that the design on the item had changed and you could still get the old ""serrated"" style through warranty service, but it had been discontinued for this new, seemingly weaker style.I ended up returning it for a refund.I uploaded two user pictures so you can see what I am talking about."
3,"Great knife, but","I haven't bought anything but a kershaw since my first one. The leek was the second kershaw I owned, and it's a great knife. Stayed sharp and it's incredibly comfortable in your pocket since it's so thin. You barely notice it even when you lay down. However, I will warn you, I have owned 3 leeks and all three of the tips broke off. Not sure if it's the steel, but I had the knives for a while before the wear and tear. I have a kershaw blur now and it's held up but is bulky so I don't wear it much. I loved the leek but I can't afford to keep buying them."
2,Edited for content,Th porn has been edited out of the porn movie. It's like watching an action film with the action deleted.
1,OMG!! sorry pitiful is to strong of a compliment,"i wonder why it isn't against the law to make movies that are this awful. i recently watched potcb. so to satisfy a bit more craving for that movie. i reluctantly rented this sad case of a movie. this is no more than a dirty old man whom wishes to have some sort of plot to his soft porn movie. the acting is horrible the digital effect are horrible. the movie over all is completely horrible. do not buy, do not rent, do not accept if given to you. not even worth the price of (FREE)..."
5,Wow...amazon selling porn?,"Daniel Lee Taylor ""dan57"" you are totally clueless. All this is, is an edited version of the porn. This is a PORN film. Not some cheap lets make fun of POTC, but a PORN. Just thought I would let you all know who are confused as well."
2,Didn't know there are 2 different versions of this film,"I did not realize that I was buying a version of this film that was edited down to be R-Rated...I had seen the unrated version and thought I was buying that, not knowing that they had made another version with much less content. The acting is terrible, but the story is semi-entertaining. Anyways, buyer beware!"
3,It's Porn that's Rate ARRRRRRR!!!!!!!,"Get it? Get it? Rated Arrrrrrr!!!!! Seriously though, there costumes weren't believeable, everyone knows that Pirates wear ARRRRgyle. Sorry, had too.It's softcore porn, I think you know how it is."
5,Kershaw Ken Onion,"Great product, fast delivery. May be one of the best knives I have ever owned. VERY sharp, speedy opening and slim for everday carry. Can't beat for the price!"
4,"Nice knife, would prefer left-pocket clip option","I ordered one of these after seeing a friend's non-DLC Leek. He had nothing but good things to say about the knife, and I really like the SpeedSafe feature.The handle is a bit slender, but it works for my hands. For me it's a good compromise between a knife that fills your hand and compactness in the pocket.My only beef is that while the pocket clip can be moved for tip-up or tip-down carry, it is only configured for carry in the right-hand pocket. I'm a lefty, so I spent $10 on a drill bit and M2.2x0.45mm tap to add holes for left-pocket carry. We'll see how that goes. Speaking of the pocket clip, it would be nice if they included a T6 Torx bit in the box for moving the clip. No big deal, but I have to spend another $2 for a tiny little 1/4"" drive bit that should come with the knife.Overall, I recommend this knife. It's a solid piece of steel for a reasonable price."
5,Best day-to-day knife I've owned,"Owning several (maybe 20-25) small folding knives throughout my life, this by far my favorite on the bases of looks, function, and ease of use. The blade is spectacular, the finish makes it easy to hold, it can be very easily and quickly opened and closed with one hand, and the shape of the blade ends up being more convenient than curved blades for many simple daily functions. I really, really recommend this knife."
2,Disappointing,"I own a Kershaw 1840st shallot and love it. I bought this one thinking it was just a smaller version of the shallot. It is smaller, but also cheaper. Doesn't have near the feel of quality. Would not recommend this Onion."
2,Impractical,I was disappointed in the cookbook. We are not gourmet cooks. I assume many of the recipes are from the restaurant the chef runs. I was looking for a down-to-earth guide to nutrition for an amateur triathlete. Sorry Chris I like your other books but not this one. Can I get a refund?
4,Diet Revolution,"Although I've only had this book in my possession for a number of hours, I am already quite impressed. This will be a good way to eat right and introduce alot of variety into my diet. I've made the Ricotta and Spinach Lasagna and it was absolutely fantastic. If the rest of the recipes compare to the Lasagna I think this book has earned a special place in my kitchen."
5,great food for athletes,"We've had the book for a few weeks now and have sampled some recipes. Not only is the food good, but the preparation is easy and it doesn't have expensive ""exotic"" ingredients that make cooking at home more trouble than its worth.I was a little wary of the way the plan/meals were broken down, but after reading the text (there's a lot), it was well-explained and made sense for both athletes and folks just looking for healthy food choices in a busy lifestyle.I own all the Carmichael books and think they're very helpful and informative for cyclists and general athletes."
1,The 70's are over,"This text is absolutely horrible. This book is a throwback to the textbooks of the 70's. Incredibly boring and very poor examples. The accompanying study guide is a complete joke and not worth the money. This book is loaded with errors. If you have problems going to sleep, then read this text. No color, no diagrams just plain text like the olden day books. Not a good book for learning."
4,Goddess Urd Rocks!,"This is the first Oh, My Goddess I've read. Urd is the new female with attitude along with Ryoko. If she wasn't there,the manga would lose something. Get this volume!"
3,series ran out of steam,"I loved the first two series, but the third is very different. For a story about a fashion house, there is strangely little about fashion in this series. There is far too much about Jack's failed directing career, Jack's failed journalism career and Jack's political career. There are a few good little subplots about Tilly, Agnes, and the others from the workroom that I actually enjoyed more than the plots regarding Evie and Beatrice, which seemed to be retreads from the first two series. The grand finale of the showing of the latest collection was a big letdown compared to the other series.The production values for this series were also noticably lower, especially the sound. Be prepared to keep your hand on the remote to make frequent adjustments and do rewinds a few times to hear the lower-volume conversations."
1,Where's the rest?,I loved this series until what I guess was the last episode. It just ended with everything up in the air. There was no conclusion. IT JUST STOPPED. It left you hanging as if they cancelled the series right in the middle of production and never wrapped it up. It was extremely disappointing to watch the whole thing becoming involved with all the characters and then finding out they didn't have anymore episodes and everyone was still in embroiled in some new and unfinished turmoil. It was very upsetting to say the least.
2,disappointing,"I think what's annoyed me the most is that Evie has gone from a talented, and exciting person to a major cow. All she seems to care about is herself and her own wants. And this whole relationship with Daniel made no sense whatsoever. Daniel as loyal husband just didn't work when one couldn't see the connection between them. On her side, it all just seemed to be about possession. On his, who knows? the acting was weak there.The rest of it was quite boring. This series was not gripping like Series 1 and at least half of series 2 (that got annoying with Evie's selfishness again). And the dialogue in general and the acting was getting more and more stilted and dull."
1,The pony did her trick,"Um, no. This book really doesn't work. Yes, it has many nice details, Yes the author creates a NYC that rings true. But no, I did not care about any of the characters, it took far too long to move itself along and once it did, I was left feeling...why? I loved IN THE DRINK and felt it was brilliant. As much as I loved that book, I disliked this one. It felt like material that had originally not made the cut for IN THE DRINK. This may not be the case, but that is the feeling."
1,Softkey Kitchen Gourmet,Everytime I put the CD in the drive the entire computer freezes and has to be reset. This happens as soon as the cd enters the bay.
5,Another Dimension,"This book gives readers a unique view into the work and mind of Joel-Peter Witkin. Not only does it provide us with a good sampling of his own thought-provoking imagery, but also with visual references of the works that have influenced his photographs. In addition, Witkin gives us, in his own words, written insight, a personal interpretation of some of the images he has created. It is put together nicely with the text preceeding the photographs so that the photos occupy seperate pages. In this way the text enhances the viewing rather than interrupts it.Highly recommended."
5,fun,Little ones love to sing and dance along with the show. No violent crazyness. A quick 20-25 minute show while preping dinner.
5,The title says it all,"As a novice woodworker primarily interested in builing projects with hand tools, I have found this book indispensable. It covers a wide range of hand tools, describing selection, use and care. It also gives recommendations on how to start your tool collection; the essential equipment and where to find or how to make them.The text is informative yet very readable. The pictures are full rich color. The author even includes a few projects, such as a workbench, to get you on your way.Obviously, no one book can tell you everything you need to know about hand tools (after all you can find entire books on planes or saws alone), but if you want a solid basis to start your hand tool collection and use, I'd start here."
3,Does OK... not impressed though,"I bought this to use with my Nikon Trailblazer ATB 10x50's which have a compact frame. It does fit, but doesn't HOLD them very securely. I am primarily using this for big game hunting out west and if I have to set up looking down at any angle I worry that the binoculars might slip out and fall into the canyon! I will continue to use it, but it's not a good permanent solution to a universal tripod mount in my opinion. I wish they'd just put a middle strap in front so that it would be impossible for your binos to fall out..."
4,Low Light...but that is what it is suppose to be...,"I agree with the above reviewer, the level of light is pretty low. But, this is not a propane lantern. It is meant to be a low level light source for things like getting ready for bed while camping, etc.. I normally use a gas lantern for my camping and got this for inside the tent. IT serves it purpose for a $10 item. If you want something brighter, I would suggest I higher end item that will cost more.."
1,NOT ONE OF MS. FORSTER'S BETTER WORKS!,"I think Jessie's kinda sick bec. she got 'hot' whenever Luc threatened/insulted/forced her. As far as I'm concerned, there was ONLY ONE LOVE SCENE in the whole book; the rest was just barely short of rape. Also, the author's obsession with anything Italian (i.e., Jessie's daughter and the Italian nanny talked in Italian way too much, and her emphasis on Italian rootwords like 'insolente') muddled the story. (I mean, I didn't buy this book to pick up some Italian!)I recommend Nora Roberts for those who prefer gritty, sensual, captivating romance."
5,Excitement & More,"This book deserves more than 5 stars. If you like adventure, action, mystery and a hero that stays 2 jumps ahead of the villains, this is it. There was enough romance and betrayal to make it interesting. I couldn't put it down and devoured each page racing to the next. So much excitement packed into this that I'm looking forward to the second of the series. Indiana Jones look out."
1,This Is A Horrible Book,I was thoroughly and completely disappointed with Anabolics 2000. There was nowhere near enough information on steroid side effects and the legal ramifications of steroid use. I learned far more about steroids doing research on the web. This book was a total and complete waste of my time and money.
2,Warning!,Do not buy this book if you already own Rosemary's Family Herbal! All but three recipes in Herbs for Natural Beauty are contained in the Herbal. Even the copy is the same. I was very disappointed.
4,Great Images and descriptions but does need to be re-proofed,This book is filled with excellent photos with great descriptions. The best historical book on spy hardware that I have ever seen. It does need to be re-proof read though... I noticed at least 3 spots where the text just ends in mid sentence which seemed really odd for a book of this caliber. It's just a minor irritation but otherwise it's a 5 star book.
1,traveling in the cloud,"Unfortunately, we had to use whatever textbook assigned by the professor; we CAN NOT have an opinion over the book we use. Whoever publised this lousy textbook should really do a survey, and get feedbacks from students rather from the faculty members(if that is the case). The imposing of using this textbook is beyond our comprehension. The instructor admitted mistakes several places made in the book. Though, he has used it as textbook for few years! If students were asked how much they understood based on reading textbook, the author would be really, really disspointed. Please if whoever out there think of writing a accounting textbook in the future, please, please keep it in mind that the book is for students not for the ACCOUNTANTS, CPA, and ACCOUNTING PROFESSORS."
4,Austin TX based Swing/Big Band Sound,"Independently released, 13 tracks:Continental HolidayWho Knew?Skuter TangoSweet CharadeThat's Why I'm Singing the BluesDastardly SchemeYou're the YouMoon Over Mauna KaiJulia Hangs the MoonDrive Me CrazyEggplant ParmesanDeseableDella's Tango"
1,Not for VW Double DIN radios,"The description indicates they are for VW, but unless you happen to have a single-DIN VW radio, these just dont work. If you have a double DIN radio, you need two sets of keys, and these ARE NOT DOUBLE DIN KEYS.As much as you may hate it, go to the VW dealer and either buy a pair, or most dealers will come out and remove it for you or lend you the keys to use in the parking lot.These just simply arent the right keys."
4,Works for Mercedes W210 E Class Radio,"Pro: At least with my Mercedes OEM radio (1999 E Class), removing the radio was a snap with this tool.Con: Not super sturdy (would not take much effort to bend these).Given the price I paid, this is a good value."
1,not suitable for Passat,"These will not remove the Monsoon radio on a 2005 Passat. I bought 2 sets (double din) and the shipping was $6.19 for items that could and should have been in a standard envelope with a couple first class stamps. Maybe they work for a Mercedes, but I will now go rent a radio kit."
3,Gets the job done,"They are successful in getting the radio out (2007 Audi A4), but getting the tools out of the radio is a bit trickier. Unlike other posts, I didnt pull until it broke, but pushed the radio latch down and into the radio, which allowed them to come out. A bit tricky to figure out at first, but now that I know it works."
1,Would give a lower score if I could,"Absolute GARBAGE! Not only do you need 4 to remove the radio and they only send 2 but the 2 they sent are now stuck in my dash and cannot be removed until I get 2 more tools. Will be buying them locally. This is likely my last purchase from Amazon. Customer service was unhelpful to say the least. Their insistence is on the fact that only 2 are shown in the picture. Ok, they got me for the $10.53 but they have lost my business for life."
4,Works as expected.,"These radio removal tools are cheaper than some of the others I've seen, but they work as expected. Yes, they only come two to a set and therefore you have to buy two sets, but I'm pretty sure that's true of other, similar but more expensive tools.My only problem was it was slightly tricky to remove the tools from the radio, but that seemed to have more to do with the design of the latches on the radio than the tools themselves.I would have given 5 stars if they just came in a set of four, but just know that you'll need two sets."
4,Compact and useful guide,"I liked the book in general, its compact style and sound advice. It serves as a guide that maybe useful to grad students especially those in their first years, a recommended reading.What I didn't like was:1- The first chapters were more like a research paper full of citations and quote that distracted me a lot from the main topic. Fortunately this style didn't continue for the later chapters.2- If you are not a chemistry/psychology student you will feel uncomfortable sometimes since the books quotes many examples from those fields. But all in all is ok.3- Still not what I wanted exactly, a book that covers the thought process for discovery, generating ideas, and the transition from the more relaxed/dependent style of undergraduate to the rigor/creative style of grad. school. Surely the book talks about this in one chapter or two but what I wanted was more devotion to these concepts."
3,cross training dvd,"This product is more for beginners, maybe some intermediates. It is well cued and easy to follow, doesn't require special equipment. It was disappointing in that it is little excerpts from other workout dvds by Jeanette Jenkins."
2,Over rated,"I too enjoyed these gloves for a while until they got a few months old. They kept the water out for a while and then just quit. when they get wet in the slushy snow, they gain 5 pounds each and freeze your hands, not good. If they were in the sub-$15 range that would be one thing. At over $30 they are a rip off. On the positive side, they do a good job in cold dry weather. Similar to the regular Cold Condition gloves that say they are water resistant, not even close. Both are worthless when they get wet."
3,"Helpful maybe, but don't use this DVD as your primary yoga practice","This DVD is quite different from others that I own, I'm not sure that I'd really call it yoga? More like stretching. I haven't tried the morning or evening practices, just the ones for specific ailments. I can see how this might be helpful...it helped my tension headache temporarily. But it seems like this DVD may have been made for older adults or for those simply looking to use yoga to help with certain issues. Not for people who are looking for a regular yoga practice. I will still probably pull this out when I have a specific issue, but won't use it otherwise. It's pretty slow. She pretty much just holds poses for lengthy amounts of time, and a lot of these aren't your typical yoga poses. This felt more like stretching and conscious relaxation than yoga. But the scenery is beautiful, the ocean is relaxing, and overall I think this is a well made DVD."
3,Not for Everyone,"There are some very nice routines: the pm are mostly relaxing and the breathing-focused one is excellent. The am routines I did not find stress-relieving. The poses are held for longer than I'm used; there is one that is supposed to ""drain the stress"" from your back but I ended up with upper back spasm for several days, possibly because I have mild fibromyalgia. (My review of Yoga for Beginners is similar). The instructor is very experienced and has a nice voice but talks almost constantly.I can't use it, but there are many great reviews. For the vast majority of people it must be really good, but if you are prone to muscle stiffness, it might not be for you."
4,Yoga for Stress Relief (with the Dalai Lama),"This yoga DVD is excellent. It has hours of different types of yoga workouts for every level and everyone. It is excellent for any one who has back and shoulder issues. It works out tension, realigns hips and is great for the SI joint. My flexibility is constantly improving and my strenght is coming back (I am a very inflexible persona and this tape works for me). This has helped to lessen my headaches and holds the poses long enough to make a difference and to allow you to do them right. The instruction is excellent and she always give modifications for those of us with little flexibility. I would recommend this tape to anyone who has had previous yoga experience (you should always go to a yoga teacher first to learn the proper way to do the exercises before doing tapes...my feeling only).Michelle"
5,Great Product,This is a long dvd. It has over 4 hours of different Yoga workout. There is also a lecture in the dvd which is okay I think.
5,Great for stress!,I use this yoga DVD whenever I am stressed and it melts the stress away. I love it! It is pretty easy for any beginners too.
1,Disappointed,"This item claims to have many different routines to provide relief for a lengthylist of conditions.When I began to use it, I was quite surprised that the routinesin a couple of different, but related, categories had the same video sectionjust repeated with a different title. It was my impression that this DVD isnot quite up to more current yoga practices."
1,Doesn't play,"The DVD does not play. Tried it on a couple of players but does not register. At $7, it isn't worth sending back-postage would be more that the DVD. Would have to really think hard before purchasing from this seller again."
4,VERY SLOW,This a good video for STRESS RELIEF or very light stretching. Each stretch takes about 5 minutes....it is very slow. I find stress relief in most Yoga but it was just too slow for me.
5,Works Well,This is a very good set of yoga practices for relieving and coping with the effects that stress has on your body and mind. The routine titles make it easy to find what you need. The instruction is clear. The practice is appropriately paced. If you are interested in yoga as a way to manage stress issues then I would recommend this DVD highly.
4,Yoga for Relaxation- great DVD!,"This DVD offers many different poses and a relaxing backdrop. The woman's voice is soothing, which combined with the noise of the waves, makes it very easy to concentrate and do Yoga breathing. Although I prefer taking classes in person, this DVD is great for days when I can't get to the studio!"
2,"Good product, bad shipping","I had a horrible experience with the shipping of this item. The fault was not with Amazon - they did not do the shipping, it was shipped by Target. Target packed the hostess set horribly. I had to have the item shipped 3 more times (I had to go through Target), and had to return it at least once. I had ordered 2 of these sets and there was always one or two things broken or missing. On the last try they finally got it right! I love the product - just had a horrible experience with the shipping from Target!"
2,Inadequate,"It's strictly about carving two patterns on handles of canes or walking sticks. I'm a beginer, so I need a more complete book. The step-by-step color pictures are great-- in fine detail, but they need to be numbered in order, to avoid confusion.The book is poorly bound; I had to glue the back cover, but it just came loose again."
4,Review of Panasonic Earphones,"The Panasonic earphones are a great price for such a well-respected company -- you know you're getting quality merchandise -- and the set comes with 3 different sizes of ear piece attachments to allow you to select the one most comfortabe for you, offering you the best sound. I bought these for my son, and he said that the sound is somewhat softer (not as loud) as he would like it, regardless of which ear pieces he uses, but he added that the sound is clearer than some of the other earphone sets he's had, and he definitely wants to keep the Panasonic earphones. He also likes the way they fit into his ears; we've tried a few brands that just arent't built well and it's hard to keep them on (and these were some of the more expensive brands). Overall, we love the product and highly recommend it."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've had these headphones for about 5 months. I bought them because I liked the design of the buds and they were pretty cheap and the Sony reviews weren't so good. I read lots of reviews on these that the bass was cruddy, but one review said that you just needed to break them in a little, then it wasn't so bad.When I first got these headphones, I thought they were terrible. The bass sounded very crackily and made an annoying sizzle sound. So, I turned off the bass boost for a while. After a while I noticed that it wasn't making that sound anymore so I turned the boost back on, and it was fine.They definitly don't keep as much noise out as I'd like them too (I have to ride the subway every day), but they are still a really good product for the price. If you wan't superb headphones, you need to spend at least $50. But if you're just looking for something that is good enough, get these."
5,Martha Washington: An American Life,"Wonderful, informative, so thorough that I learned much more than I thought I would. Nothing left out as far as I can determine."
4,A Must Read for Young Foreign Students/Parents in Japan,"I don't understand why it's so difficult to get a copy of this book because I thought it was terrific and relevant for any non-Japanese interested in the Japanese elementary school experience. It was full of pithy, real-life accounts of the ups and downs of an Australian boy and his mother in the fifth and sixth grade in a public school in Tokyo. I couldn't give it five stars because it seemed like a lot of the details were recalled long after they had occurred and so I occasionally wanted more details. A daily diary would have been more reliable. However, the mother had a lot of different schools to compare this one to because they had traveled to several countries together and also been in a private international school in Japan. I felt her insights had true global perspective for comparing and contrasting the Japanese public school."
4,My Grandson will love it,"I know my 2 1/2 year old grandson will love this Christmas present, but it does have some bugs.On my Windows XP when you try to put out the fire, the game pops back to the previous screen. If I reduced the screen size by pushing F12 it won't do that.There is also a problem when you blow the clouds over the sun in the wind segment. The screen is filled with horizontal lines. That too is corrected by reducing the screen size.I would like him to be able to play the game without reducing the screen size, so if anyone has another solution please let me know.Even with these problems it's still a good game."
4,just what I was looking for,I am an adult and could not afford the expensive bath storage basket. I use it for my razor soap sponges and soaps. I works great for me. Thanks for the product and the price.
4,Works well,I like this better then the bags that hold toys. This keeps them up out of the water all the time. When the shower is used the water just drains out of the grids. The only downfall I give it is it gets in the way of the shower curtain when the shower is being used. Other then that I think its a wonderful product. My two kids put it in the middle when they take thier bath.
4,Bath time,"Love this item to keep track of my daughter's bath toys. It is easy to move around and adjust to fit the tub. It is a little hard to clean all the tracks and groves. Overall, a great bathroom accessory to have."
5,Perfect for the bath,"This worked great for both our kids. They used it til they were old enough to start taking showers...great way to store toys during and after bath time, and it was also a cute way to divide the tub in two, with one kid on each side of the basket. Loved it."
5,Love it!,My son is 8 months old so this makes all of his toys reachable to me along with shampoo and other goodies. I love it product and it drains very well.
3,"Interesting, but...","I had to read this for a class... the book was easy to understand and read, but there were TOO many Spanish words in it and when you read it aloud, it's hard to pronounce unless you know Spanish... I also had to write notes on it and it was hard to summarize, because the events in the book were confusing... this book is not that good, only okay..."
3,"Good, somewhat simplistic","I want to start off by saying if you want a good fictional account of a child immigrating from Mexico, watch the movie Under the Same Moon, or La Misma LunaUnder the Same Moonit shows more hardships, I think, and had pretty much a whole class of college students almost in tears.Now, about this book. It shows some of the hardships of crossing the border, but in a somewhat simplistic fashion. It also shows the process of Americanization and what happens when American values conflict with traditional Mexican values. It also seemed to want to legitimize crossing a border illigally which, no matter what the reasons, is still a crime. I really did not like the ending, but I won't say more about it because I don't want to spoil it.It is an easy read, I would reccomend it for third/fourth grade students. It would be a good read in Southern California. If you live near Indio or Colton, it's a really interesting book, and you can map out the path of Lupita and her brother."
2,Simplistic,"It is an easy read with a fast paced plot, and accesable to upper elementary students. It touches on some very real issues facing the United States today. Still, I feel the book is lacking in many areas.The dialog is unsuccesful at conveying linguistic paterns of Mexican Spanish speakers. They seem to say ""sí"" to just about everything. The dialog in English is equally problematic because her characters have not embraced the use of contractions. The result sounds stilted and highly uncharacteristic of a person speaking English with a Mexican accent.If children read only one book about the journey of undocumented immigrants I think they will get a very narrow perspective from this book. Very few Mexican immigrants come from Baja California and for most the journey is much more arduos and deadly.Would I recommend the book to children in a classroom? no."
4,Very good but could be improved,"As another reviewer put it, this flashlight ""does what it's supposed to do"". However, as another reviewer observed (to paraphrase)it's too bad one has to cycle through all flash options. In connection with the latter, it defeats the purpose of the red beam's night-vision saving properties to have to subsequently turn on the white LED beam and the bright krypton spotlight beam. I feel the flashlight should have a separate beam selection switch in addition to the on-off button. Nevertheless, I'm glad I bought the flashlight as a replacement for my old metal body Rayovac Sportsman flashlight which just gave out. The pluses exceed the minuses with this flashlight but Rayovac could do better."
2,Fun...but my eyes get sore fast,"We were excited to get this game based on reviews here and the positive comparisons to SSX. The scenery is done well, but not nearly as varied as SSX. The variety of racing was also good - especially the mode where you can race your best lap. Unfortunatly, our eyes get sore very fast when playing this game. It seems that the entire screen shifts for every subtle movement of your vehicle. Maybe it's just the two of us here(because I didn't notice this complaint in reading a few other reviews) but we are only able to play for a short burst without feeling eye strain. This alone knocks 2 stars off our rating."
2,Offroad fury: Not any good,Now this game has gotten great reviews. A lot of my freinds have it and love it. But I just dont understand why. Wiping out is cool and a lot of fun on the stunt mode and thats why I gave it the 2 stars. Racing is boring. I tjought ATVs would of worked but I guess they didnt.Better just stick to cars and motorcycles.
2,Boring and repetitive,"I don't know...maybe I'm just spoiled by the SSX Snowboarding series. This ATVOF game seems slow and repetitive to me. My 6-year old daughter and I just don't feel the enthusiasm for this game (I'd say the same about WaveRunner).Our first game, SSX Snowboarding (and it's sequel ""Tricky"" ) is still the most exciting game we have. If you enjoy the fast-paced action of the SSX games, you'll be bored with the slower and repetitive action of ATVOF. ..."
1,Boooring,"If you like ATVs a lot or if you love racing games you might like this game. The courses are good, and so are the other modes, but they soon start to wear on you. I rented this game, and after three days I was sick of it. There was barely any variety in the courses, and the AI of computer racers was unbelievably cheap. Even the freestyle mode was boring. Though it was good at first, the lak of replayability gave it a one."
3,ATV vs MM2,"ATV's graphics are very detailed and the scenery is nice - but aside from being on a 4-wheeler, there is not much varing between Motocross Madness and this game, even down to the ""edge of the world"" toss. Nice game, but...you can get the same thing for the PC."
2,Elementary Information and Terrible Graphic Design,"This book contains some elementary information about typography and layout, but the examples are TERRIBLE and the actually layout of this book is also TERRIBLE! I should have known from the cover. Just look at it. I would have given this book a single star were it not for the actual written content."
3,Glenn M.J. Epps,"I met Glenn Epps in the Spring of 1995, and considered him to be a close friend. Glenn passed away on October 11, 1997 at the age of 31 years.Glenn was one of the most independent, complex people I have ever met. A man of great perceptive powers, he saw fundamental flaws in our political and economic system, problems that most people would ignore or pass over. ""Distortions of Reality"" is about this.Glenn had a great concern for justice and human rights, especially for the ""little guy."" He would involve himself in lengthy legal cases at his own expense, simply to expose faults in the system that were hurting other people without their knowledge. Glenn also fought tirelessly for children's right to genital integrity (against forcible circumcision of children).Sadly, I found this book nearly unreadable. The writing is idiosyncratic and often fragmented. Still, it is a way of remembering a man who gave selflessly to the world, and deserves to be remembered as a friend."
2,"no dts no bass in 5/1 ,ix",what a lousy job of mixing for the 5.1 mix there is no bass at all in the subwoofer channel. I have tous the dolby 2.0 mix and my receiver's processing to get any subwoofer output.And why dolby? why not DTS or DVD-a Opeth's music doesn't deserve a lossy dobly presentation.very disappointed with the DVD
3,Quick cut editing renders even the most intelligent material stupid,"All the elements are in place here to create one of the highest quality productions a fan of Opeth could want. However, some nit wit in the editing suite decided it would be a good idea to present the entire show with quick cut MTV style smash and grab editing so the average length of any shot is no more than a second at best. This is inexcusable. Great show, great music horrible moronic editing."
5,Great for the mini burner I bought,Bought a mini light weight burner for hiking and camping and this fits it perfectly! Bought 2 and my fiancé loves them!
4,Excellent,"I enjoyed ""The Bullet Trick"" a lot. It's similar to Welsh's ""The Cutting Room"" which I liked a bit more. Welsh is a helluva writer and the plot is intricate and compelling. The story jumps around in time and location (Glasgow, London, Berlin) and it still flows very well, especially at the end when it all merges into one.The protagonist William is a bit dicey but good at the core. There are plenty of shady characters, pub life, and interesting British dialogue (Scottish and English). There's also a lot of info about conjuring and the magician's trade.As in ""..Room"", underground entertainment dealing with sex trade is a primal element. Not for the squeamish. After reading ""..Room"", the whole treatment felt a bit formula in ""..Trick"". I probably would have given it 5 stars had I read it before ""..Room""."
3,"Paul Simon's Greatest Work Of Nostalgia, Etc., Etc., Etc.","This is the first Paul Simon album I ever received when I first became a fan of his in 1977. I never knew that the first two songs ""Slip Slidin' Away"" and ""Stranded In A Limousine"" (also, with the exception of the live version of ""American Tune"") were singles. They were just as great as the other songs. I'd do anything to find a C.D. of this album - REMASTERED - BRAND NEW - FACTORY SEALED - NOT USED (with no unnecessary bonus tracks). I'd also hope that it wouldn't be too expensive. I know its a hard-to-find item, but this is one of Paul's best albums - a real retrospective. Paul's albums are fantastic!"
5,Good lookin' and sharp!!!!!,"This knife is super sleek, quick to open, sharp and looks great. Good construction.The black coating does scratch but it's better than I expected."
3,Le Cordon Bleu at Home by Le Cordon Bleu,"Overall this book is ok...I guess, but don't really like it much from the way the book put things together...however this is a person option. The book doesn't have a content. It didn't give you the name of the food, but give you the whole course of the meal...like course number. If you would like to look up for certain food, you can go to index.Moreover it has only few picture, but I guess I got what I paid for, right? If you love to see pictures of the food that you will be cooking...this is not what you're looking for.However I do like the tip at the end of the book and there are descriptions and pictures along with them.Hope this may help"
5,phenomenal,"i have always been a big fan and tried to see him and his brothers on stage throughout my life, but it didn`t happen; so when this dvd came along it satisfied that desire; this footage places you front and center; he was an artist and entertainer that dazzled his audience;"
5,Michael Jackson Live in Bucharest,This show is awesome! Really shows Michael's natural talent(live)and is very entertaining. There is a very touching moment when he invites a young woman audience member up on stage. He really gets the crowd going. Wish he could have done more shows in the United States.
1,We want to see the performance not the audience!!!!!!,This concert is fantastic but whoever recorded this keeps showing the audience and you miss little bits of Michael performing. I have seen this same concert on tv where they do not do this and it is much much better that way.
1,I have not receive this item,I made this purchase of two items only one arrived the live in bucharest I am still waititing???
5,Breathtaking!,"Michael did it all! I miss him! I never saw him in concert, but this is the next best thing! What a show!"
4,Disney's goof troop,If your game does not work try using the cleaning kit or get the ear cleaner and put a (little) water on it and try rubbing it on the inside of the bottom. You will find some specs of green stuff on the ear cleaner. Yuck!
5,AWESOME GAME,"one of the best strategy games ever made for SNES. Make sure to play with a friend, as it's really hard to play solo."
2,Havent recieved first issue yet!!!,I really cant rate an item that I have not recieved yet. Ordered this as a gift for my Mother and she has not recieved the first issue!!Dont know whats up with that.
5,Great Knife,I had always wanted an assist open knife. The Ken Onion designed Leek was the size I was looking for as an EDC. The assist open is very smooth and fast. I carry in the pocket and it has proven to be safe. The blade comes quite sharp. The blade is on the thin side so prying is out for this tool. I would definitely recommend and purchase again.
4,Bollywood Dance with Jaya Vaswani,Very nice. She really knows how to dance and makes it look simple to learn all the steps. Thank you.
2,Snapshot of addiction: Two-weeks worth of junkies' fighting their demons,"A rambling vignette of a group of recovering ex-con addicts who seem hopelessly glued to their world of narco-narcissism. Imagine stepping into an inner city Drug Rehab Program for forty-something coke-heads and booze-brothers and following them through their daily travails. This is what watching this film is all about.Superb performances and authentic dialogue are counterbalanced by the tedium of watching the day-to-day meanderings of dope fiends who do very little of a noteworthy nature other than get a girl friend pregnant and overdose on heroin. For its realism, this picture is without equal: it is superb. As a compelling drama, it falls flat thanks to a story that has just too few meaty nuggets to keep one's interest."
1,Borderline dangerous,"I have four 16-piece sets that I received for my wedding. They are beautiful plates, but they have a tendency to split in half with normal use - like heating food up in the microwave, going through the dishwasher or serving hot food.Within 3 months, several plates cracked down the middle, making them unusable. A large serving bowl also split in half when hot food was added. I did a search on www.epinions.com and found I wasn't the only person having these problems. EVERYONE is having these problems.Plus, it is impossible to find individual replacement pieces. You have to buy another set. What a racket. The clincher is that they are located in Indonesia, so customer service and responsiveness is nonexistent. I've gotten nothing but the international run-around."
5,One of the most exotic photo essay,"This is book that contains many shocking photo that reflects many interesting aspects of the Japanese Culture. It is definitely one of the most interesting photo journey I have read. It is a collection of temples, museums, and site in Japan. From Hokkaido to Kyushu, it included over 150 extremely intriguing places. Great photograph, and great layout of the book. It sure suits its name ""Roadside Japan"". Some of the picture might be disturbing for some people, but that is just part of the Japanese Culture."
5,Highly Recommended,Girl Clown should be placed at the top of everyone's reading list. Ms. Wise writes in a down to earth style that is extremely refreshing. What a marvelous read. I'm excited that she has decided to publish her experiences from a unique career choice.Jennifer Stireswww.jennswritings.comwww.lulu.com/JStires
5,husbands kinda movie!!!!!,"this is one of my husbands favs.now that he has it ,he'll sit in his chair even longer."
5,Support Your Local Sheriff,"This is a true comedy.It is clean, hilarious and a great show for your children. The whole family can enjoy it together. We have watched this movie so many times and we still laugh everytime we watch it. It is our family favorite."
5,Great Movie,I Love the movie and the quality of it is better than I have found anywhere else. I would Definitely recommend!
4,"Low budget classic, at least in my book","I agree with the other reviewer who found this movie hilarious. It is. This is a very fun movie to watch. Frederick is a pleasure to watch in this flick; he holds this perpetual look of borderline surprise throughout the film, as if he can't believe he's actually in this movie. He seems to compensate by maintaining an attitude of muted sardonic humor, not only in his facial expressions but in his lines.The picture quality and sound quality are horrible but they add to the film's ultimate charm; in other words, this is a plus rather than a minus. It's a game to look for all the flubs. In one scene at the beginning one can clearly see the boom mike sticking up from under the coffee table, panning right and left as each character talks in turn.And the rubber babies? Can't beat it.Let's just say I highly recommend this to all lovers of B horror flicks."
4,The Duchess,"The Duchess is the perfect period piece. Keira Knightley is lovely, full of restrained emotion. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the direction makes the film almost like theater. Also, great musical score adds to the emotional content of the film."
3,It's OK,"For some reason I expected great things from this film, even though I don't know much about the person this film was about. I felt a bit rushed in this film. I felt like something was missing nearly the entire time and I couldn't put my finger on it. It wasn't the relationship between Georgiana and her husband, it was supposed to be like that and in that respect the film achieved its purposed, but the relationship between Georgiana and her best friend seemed like they were enemies trying to get along with each other before she even found out about their sleeping together. I also felt the chemistry between her and her lover was minimal.The costumes are lovely and so are the sets, but something was missing and I could never find it."
2,Pretty Flat,"There are a lot of beautiful costumes in the movie... and that's the best part of the movie. I am not sure why this simple drama had to be staged centuries ago with all the expensive costumes and the old manners etc. There was nothing new or old in that simple love of a woman for her children and a man who is not her husband. Nothing catchy happens in the movie. I would pay $0.99 to watch this movie on an evening when I am tired and do not want to think at all, or maybe while I am cooking, so that I do not have to follow the movie every minute."
4,Ike and Tina-Eighteenth Century Style,"It's obvious that the makers of ""The Duchess"" were attempting to draw a parallel between the more recent foibles in the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Usually, I don't like these period pieces where usually the ornate settings and lavish costumes overwhelm the story. This one intrigued me in a Tennessee Williams or John O'Hara kind of way. Yes, the film is a potboiler but not one to easily dismiss. The film teeters at time towards parody but ultimately it grounds itself in reality. It helps that the leads are two superb actors. Keira Knightley projects a stiff upper lip as the Duchess of Devonshire, a woman forced to suffer indignity because of the strict mores of the time. Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire adds weight to a role that could very well be caricature. He imbues some modicum of sympathy to a man that is an absolute cad. This isn't a great film but it's certainly an interesting one."
2,Poor quality audio :(,"I'm sure the movie would be great...IF I COULD HEAR IT!!! The audio quality was so poor that I gave up on watching it only 15 mins into the movie. :( The volume is too low, even with the volume on my netbook turned all the way up, and it was crackling. Not at all happy."
3,Love the movie...,"...however, when it came in the mail the top part of the dvd case was all broken and cracked I was kind of bummed out just because i dont like my stuff to be broken, the only reason i didnt make a big deal about it is because the movie works fine, afterall it probably just got broken on its way by being smashed."
2,"Nice costumes, decent story, some cheap shots","The costumes were great, the story was interesting, but there were a fair number of overdramatized sex scenes that didn't add much to the film. Lots of fainting and gasping type stuff. The women are very repressed, and it seems like you're supposed to enjoy that. This definitely falls into the ""corset ripper"" genre. Not the worst film I've ever seen, but I didn't enjoy it either."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"okay first of all, let me just say that Keira Knightley was brilliant in her role. this movie is full of the sexism of its time period. i'm not at all a feminist but i think the directors got a little carried away when it came to portraying how much of a womanizer the duke was. i know you're supposed to hate his character anyway, but when he takes his wife's best and only friend and makes her his mistress so she can get her kids back..... WTF! and the duchess' lover wasn't too appealing. they could've picked a better looking actor to make it a little more believable. but then.... i guess at that point the duchess was desperate enough to get anyone aside from her husband! this movie disgusted me. the only reason i watched it to the end was because of Keira Knightley's performance"
4,Beautifully done.,"The sets, settings and costumes are exquisite . Keira Knightly really shows herself as an accomplished, talented, dramatic actress.The story, I felt, has a sad tone to it throughout. But superbly done!"
5,REAL HARDCORE. WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT!,"THIS IS WHAT PUNK SHOULD STILL BE! THIS IS CHOKES FIRST BAND(BEFORE LAST RIGHTS OR SLAPSHOT) THIS IS WHAT STRAIGHTEDGE OR HARDCORE WAS ALL ABOUT: FAST, NO ** MELODIES, GUITAR SOLOS AND TRACK #25, NOT TAKING ANYTHING FROM SOMEONE OR THE COPS! THATS WHO HE'S YELLING AT! ANGRY & RAW!"
3,Good for when teeny boppers,"I read this book when I was about 15. Loved it. It takes a girl on a emotional journey to opening up to love. When I re-read it at 19, it seemed a little flat. Not that it's a bad book. It's fine if you're not up for a big brain scratcher."
3,This Lullaby review,"The book, This Lullaby, by Sarah Dessen is a wonderful story about a teenage girl named Remy who has a hared time believing in love. Remy's mother is on her fifth marriage, so she has never seen love actually work. She has only seen failed marriages. Remy finds her friends and family around her putting up with their boy friends and bad habits, but she doesn't understand why. She thinks that love is a hassle. Remy gets very close to falling in love with someone and then pulled away in fear of getting hurt. I would recommend this book to any girl teenager, because they can relate to Remy, and her friends.I really enjoyed the book, but it was kind of boring at the beginning. It had too many details. The thing that I liked about the book is that it had a useful message. It taught you that you should never be afraid of love and to trust you hear."
4,This Lullaby,"Another home run from Sarah Dessen! If it wasn't for just a couple things that bothered me, I would have been ready to say that this was my favorite by her thus far. I am seriously never seems to disappoint me with her stories and the way I feel afterwards. I am seriously wondering where she has been my entire life. Although Remy can sometimes be a tough main character to deal with, what with wanting to smack some sense into her sometimes, she's captivating and realistic. She represents the pessimism lots of teenage girls have about love-and she eventually comes to learn that sometimes taking the risk is necessary to finally be happy.Read more?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
5,This lullaby can really lull the reader hahaha not funny,"This book is pretty great, I've read another one of Sarah Dessen's books and am really beginning to like her style.This novel is about Remy, a tough, independant girl who doesn't believe in true love and romance. Her mother has had a million break-ups and a job as a romance writer to boot. One day, she meets Dexter, a guy who is so totally her opposite and not exactly her type, yet....somehow, she like's his funny, artistic, smart (i don't kno) personality. What will happen in this story?"
2,"This is somewhat pleasant, but easily forgotten.","I first decided to read this book for the fact that I have the same problem as Remy. I stone my heart, not the way she did hers, though. I cherished some insights Dessen made, but it just didn't go through. I knew it was important (obviously), but it couldn't hit me. Many times I wanted to slap some sense into Remy. However, the mother's character was truly amazing, the last part of it anyways. I wanted to stop reading this book, but once I start something, I have to finish it. Sarah Dessen fans will love it, but I am perfectly content to stick with, The Truth About Forever by Sarah Dessen."
5,Great Read,"I read this book a year or so ago and it is one of my favorite books of all time. Sarah Dessen did a great job writing this novel, it's an interesting read that I can read over and over. You get to know the characters and will be rooting for Remy and Dexter throughout the book."
5,Great Summer read,This is a book I loved. Remy and Dexter came to life infront of me in the pages. Can't really say much about it just that IS A MUST READ!
5,Favorite Novel & Writer,"This book is now my favorite book of all time. I was recomended to Sarah Dessen from a friend and never got around to actually buying one of her books. I found 'This Lullaby' in our school library and I read it in 3 days. I actually cried when it ended because I didn't want it to! Sarah Dessen has a major talent and I can't wait to read more of her novels! Within a week I have finished: This Lullaby, That Summer, & Dreamland and they were all excellent! I recommend any of her novels to anyone who likes a good read!"
4,simple summer read,Sarah Dessen is an amazng author for teens and young adults. Readers can quickly relate to each story she writes. I loved this book and after reading it I went on to reading the rest of her books. They are perfect for a day at the beach or lounging around the house. A must read author!
5,surprise,"This book was a total surprise to me.I never expected Senna to be the narrator of one of the books.If you have read the animorphs books you'll know that Applegate tends to use the same style of writing over and over like as she also has in the everworld series but this one was totally different.Now that Senna tells her story it makes Christopher's,David's,April's,and Jalil's stories alot easier to understand.This book was by far the best in the series.Senna's lust for power makes it even better.Although I despise Senna Applegate almost made me feel sorry for her.Almost.This was a great book and I can't wait to read the next one."
4,The Best Everworld Book?,"I agree with some thoughts already posted. The books have always overdone each other, which makes the series so good. But it also gets a bit tedious, as mentioned in another post. But overall, the series is the best I've ever read...This book, gets in deep detail with Senna, whom I have always wanted to read about. You really get to know her more, and your opinions about her will most likely change. You get to see her past and how she developed into what she is now. If you've read the previous books, read this one: It answers most of the questions you have about the series!"
2,she really draws her series' out!,"When Everworld first came out I was really excited! It was such a cool series! But K. A. Applegate has a way of drawing things out way too far! First Animorphs(where the same thing happened in every book, there are 40 something). Now this series! I say end it now while you're ahead! If you're out to read the whole series I have three words of advice to you: IT GETS TEDIOUS."
2,Poor FM stereo,The first unit couldn't even find FM stereo stations. It had similar FM specs as the Sony ST_JX410 AM/FM Tuner it was replacing. It was returned as a faulty unit. The replacement STRDE 197 was able to find stereo FM stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo. My 25 year old JX410 tuner did an excellent job on FM stereo stations. The second unit was returned for a refund. Sony's quality isn't what it use to be. I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304. The FM works fine with more features & expandability.
1,An Inadequate Receiver,"I bought this receiver from Amazon, & received it about 10 days ago. Since then, I've tried to play my cassettes of classical music. When used for this purpose, this receiver sucks big time. If I turn the volume loud enough to hear the orchestra playing softly, when the orchestra gets loud the amp shuts down & PROTECT flashes on & off. I have to turn the receiver off, then turn it back on, & lower the volume. Then of course when the music gets soft again, I can't hear it."
4,Nice basic receiver,"Nothing special but above average power for this price range. Comparably priced to large national retailer's but without the hassle of dealing with their lousy in-store service.Typical Sony quality, a well-made receiver, seems to have ample power with no clipping, controls are fairly easy to use and understand. The only complaint I have is that the volume control requires a lot of spinning to change the volume level, but the remote works better in that regard."
2,A good idea played very wrongly,"Dont get me wrong, I am a huge Paul McCartney and Wings fan, that's why I bought this album. I loved Denny's songs with Wings back in the 70's. But, unfortunately, time has took its toll on our friend Denny. The songs are poorly sung and sound like a chicken being rung around its neck occasionally. Often, Denny strains to get at the right notes and often hits the wrong note entirely. OUCH! Again, the instruments play the songs very well, but it doesn't matter if the voice is bad. Only two songs save the day..GO NOW and SEND ME THE HEART. Otherwise, avoid this at all costs. Sorry Denny, I love you but this album doesnt do you justice."
2,Head Lamp,The head light is bright and works good but the construction is cheap and this headlight didn't last long. I wear these quite a bit and this light wore out fast.
3,Very useful,"a really handy 'tool'. Sits firmly atop your head (gets a bit hot though). have not found much use for the 'red' light yet but the other two are very useful. Using it for the odd jobs at home, especially when I need to power the lights down"
4,The only good one,"It's solid, fully supported, and updated. At least it's more finder friendly than MPW. Slow but worthwhile. Worth getting."
2,"Okay, if you're at a big company.","An introduction to living abroad as an expat. The major flaw with the book is the author's assumption that the reader will (like, apparently the author) be working for a large corporation."
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was pretty good but all and all it did not work for me. Doreen always makes it sound like all you ever have to do is ask and viola! But for me, I was frustrated because I've been trying to heal a virus for a month straight and not a thing has changed for me. I really gave it my all, I thought. I must be doing something wrong but I do know that I have prayed and asked continuously for help and guidance and I am at square one. I do work with angels and I do believe they are there but unfortunately I was not able to heal myself as easily as the examples in the book. Those people are very lucky if it was indeed that easy for them."
5,:-),"Wonderful knife, sharp enough to shave the hair off arms and legs, but haven't tried it on my beard. Beautiful multi-colored handle, very nice blade and excellent customer service/support from Kershaw. Great addition to my collection of knives and I use it as an EDC."
2,Battery Defective,"This battery looked like original, but would not take a charge. Returning for replacement or refund. Hope I can get one that works."
3,Great Bargain for the Price,"Bent when received, but still working so I used it anyway - hey, it is inside a practice amp, so who cares. Good sound, better and more volume probably if I had put it in a more powerful amp. Great bargain for the price."
2,texture is unpleasant,"although it is easy to make, this cake does not rise well and has a coarse texture. there are better gf mixes out there"
3,Review of the Elements of Style,"This is good information for the use of grammar in the English language, however, sometimes the auhtor talks about dos and donts without giving concrete examples. This make it hard at times to see how a rule is applied."
4,Good advanced tool for non-English speaking teachers,"This book was purchased to be sent to a slum school in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya as a resource for the school native teachers where it is used to teach English (the primary language of Kenya) to students preparing for their entrance exams to a secondary school. One aspect of the qualification to further education in the secondary and university schools system is the ability to write ""good"" English. I have used this book in my career in communications and consider it the ""bible"" of written English."
1,This is from Alcoholics Anonymous,"I bought this thinking I was buying the Elements of Style, but what arrived is the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step book sandwiched between pages of the Elements of Style-- bound that way, so i guess you can read the AA book in public without people realizing? This page makes no mention of that. It's really bizarre."
3,A handy refminder,It's good book to read maybe once a year if you write quite a bit. It gives some very common grammatical errors to watch out for.
4,Although written on a young teen level-a prtetty good read,"The writting is made for young teen's, maybe preteens, But it is an interesting story. Good Characters, good story, a few small plot twists. I felt like I was seeing thru the eyes of teenagers. Sometimes I would think, why are they doing that? Then I remembered, oh yea their kids. I liked it enought to buy the second book."
3,Kraftwerk Resurfaces,"Well, finally at least some of the rumored activity must have been true! I have to admit I was going to buy whatever they released regardless of the wait. I'm not bowled over, but not exactly disappointed.This German release contains four versions of one theme. Track one and two are the same version with Track one shortened for radio (I presume). After you get past the ""Expo 2000"" lyrical drill, the tune is decent although a little too laid back rythmically. Track four is a close variation on the first two with less emphasis on the beat and more on the atmosphere.The real gem (at least for me) is track three... an extra theme is added, the tune finds a good solid groove and stays there.Worth having for any fan of Man-Machine through Electric Cafe. (Total time for the four tracks: 22:55)"
4,Recharging our Batteries,"It seems like many including rock critics may have misunderstood the purpose, It appears originally this wasn't even intended to be a single obviously it would be impossible to even meet long-time fans expectations however this single was made exclusively for the fans."
3,A bit disappointing,"I'm a huge Kraftwerk fan, but this was a bit disappointing after such a long silence. I hope that the rumors of a new album are true."
3,"Not Jump Start, but happy with seller",This game does not hold our kids' interest as well as Jump Start (especially Jump Start World) but we were happy that the item was exactly as described and arrived quickly and well packaged. Since there are not many choices for these upper grades (Jump Start World only goes to 2nd) these are probably as good as it gets.
2,Must be a good software but MAC users beware,"This sounds like a delightful software for children and adults alike. Kids solve math puzzles while digging for treasure in the himalayas. How lovely. However, please read the extremely small fine print before purchasing. This product works with windows only. Or a very old mac version like 7. I have an imac at home with mac os 10 and this product would not even install. Hats off to Amazon.com for their assistance with the incompatible product. Pricewise, it is not a very expensive product but it was definitely disappointing to have to return this product after purchase. I wish that the makers of this product would label and advertise appropriately to CLEARLY identify installation constraints for this software."
4,great baby sling,This sling is great. It is really fast and easy to get on. I have the Moby wrap as well and although it feels more secure than the k'tan it takes longer to put on and is cumbersome while putting on and storing. The k'tan is simple to put on and more compact for storing and traveling with.
3,too small,I like this carrier but unfortunately it came in so small. My 10lbs baby couldn't fit in the XS comfortably so I returned it for a bigger size Small. It still doesn't fit her. My recommendation for other buyers is to buy two sizes bigger than what you need. I will try to see if I can return it for a bigger size. I just hate the hassle of returning and re-ordering it.
2,Not worth it.,"I give it 2 stars for the 2 weeks i used it...my son was about 3-5 weeks old..Material stretched too much. Baby would sag in it after I used it once, Until I washed it again...Doesn't hold in head easily... I had to use my hand hold it to keep his head properly in place...so this wasn't a hands free apparatus.WAY over-priced.I don't recommend this... I do recommend the Bjorne... Used it with 3 children up until the were about 8 months. Then I moved to the baby backpack when they were a bit bigger..."
5,Worked but tricky....,"I've tried slings, baby hawkes, those Bjorn type carriers....I'm a petite 5'1 and most times, carriers are too big. The two carriers that I absolutely love are the baby hawk and this. Baby hawks are similar but let me review this carrier. Its made of tshirt material and looks like an infinity scarf when you put it over your head and around your neck. I ordered it in xsmall and have washed it several times. It hasn't shrank. You definitely have to watch the video to get how to use it. Once you understand how it works, it's easy. It is easy on the shoulders as long as you spread the material out. It isn't figure flattering because I feel like I have major muffin top going on when I tie the support fabric around me. Who cares! I have a quiet sleeping baby and I can finally grocery shop in peace! If your baby doesn't like to be held, this may not be for you. But if your baby is a snuggle bug, this is the perfect rug to bundle her up in."
2,Not a Fan,"I purchased this as I thought it would be a good alternative to the Moby Wrap which looked very initmidating to me. I didn't like it one bit. My newborn baby hung very low in this thing and never seemed to be comfortable. What is bad about this (and also what makes it ""easier"" to put on), is that it is pre-sized, and not adjustable. I am 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the size small was too big. Maybe if I had gotten the xtra small it would have fit better, but it wasn't worth shelling out additional money to find out. I went and bought the Moby Wrap from my local retailer and, after watching a video on YouTube on how to put it on, it fit so much better! Whenever my newborn would scream and cry I would put him in the Moby and he was instantly soothed. My advice...buy the Moby and skip this. Once you get the hang of the Moby it is so much better because it is adjustable which is key!!!"
4,Great Buy,"I love love love this carrier, it's versatility is optimal for my busy life style. I look forward to using it for a long time."
5,Great baby shower gift,Awesome! And super quick shipping! Looking forward to giving this to a friend at an upcoming baby shower. And can't wait to get one for myself someday.
4,baby sling review,"I bought this item as a gift for my sister, so I don't know how well she likes the product yet. My shopping experience was excellent - the item was shipped and arrived much sooner than I expected, so that was a nice surprise."
3,sizing wrong,"I went by the sizing recommended and ordered an xs. It is TOO SMALL!!! I can bearly get my tiny newborn in the wrap. I was worried about the size when I received it but went ahead and washed it according to directions because multiple reviews said it would stretch out and not to worry about it feeling too small. I've tried stretching it out multiple times and wearing it with my baby in it but I'm still not happy. I'm only 5'0"" and lost all of my pregnancy weight right away so I feel like it should fit without a problem. I think I would really like it if I had the next size up but don't want to spend the money after I bought this one in case the next size up doesn't work either. Wondering if I should have just purchased the moby wrap even though it seemed intimidating. I will say that my newborn does seem to like the wrap but I really don't think I will be able to get her in it much longer."
5,Ok,"Baby not here yet, expecting parents....thumbs up! There are thirteen more words that will say nothing but have a stupid robot calculate how many words and waste my time...... :("
1,STR-DE697 Setup,I recently purchased this unit to replace a 12 year old Pioneer audio receiver. I have not been able to set it up yet because the manual that comes with it is virtually incomprehensible to a novice audiophile. I do not seem to be able to even set the bass and treble levels without getting an advanced degree in electronics. Whoever wrote this mish-mash of a manual should join the babbel school of tech writing. Shame on Sony.
5,A great system,"I recently purchased this system, and I must say that I love it. The sound is incredible, and the system looks wonderful as part of a home theater setup. Set up was also very easy, and the DVD picture quality in excellent. All in all, I feel that this was an excellent purchase, but look around, it can be had for under $599."
1,Dream Systems Have Known DVD Player Problems,"When the unit works it sounds great and looks sharp. Problem is Sony has sent out a batch of lemon systems. The DVD players fail and become unusable. This is a common problem with the DAV-FR9 Dream System and similar models. Just pass on this one, its not worth the hastle since Sony won't pay to have these systems fixed."
3,Helmet not very accurate.,"The helmet is made out of heavy resin and its material is weak in other words if you drop it or bump into a wall while wearing it, it will dent (even small minor hits will dent it). The helmet is mostly just for show its small and the side vents are painted on which are just ovals. The helmet is not accurate to the movie. If your a real collector I do not recommend this helmet. If your going out for hollowen and you want something cooler than a Hasbro helmet I recommend this helmet."
4,Weird name good Game,I found this game truly exciting. The graphics aren't the best but they provide the ample graphics needed. I think that this game is very basic yet entertaining and addictive. I bought this game 3 months ago and play it all the time. Not to mention the the low space it takes up on my palm m100. Overall I give the product 4 stars due to the above mentioned items.
5,Wonderful,"I have taken this product for some years andwas beginning to find it hard to get, happilyI found it on Amazon, and will continue to orderit for years to come. This product boosts myenergy, gives me vitimans I don't seem to getany place else, and is so easy to use. If itsgood for the Queen Bee, its better for me."
1,"Received a ""lemon""","I read the reviews on this TV/Combo before I purchased it. I am sorry to say perhaps I have received a bad one. Not even a month after I purchased this - I am having problems with the DVD getting ""stuck"". We are very careful with our electronics and there is no reason why this unit should be doing this. Right now - the DVD is open and will not close - this is probably the 4th time it has done this. I purchased a much cheaper Panaconic combo for my mother a year ago and it has had absolutely no problems at all. I wished I would have saved myself about $200 and purchased a Panasonic for my home as well."
3,unaware,"I liked that she explain it nice and slow, but it is difficult for a beginner like myself. I think this dvd should be for someone that did it before. After the first 10 minutes I was worn out. I think it will take a couple of trys to complete the dvd, I will keep trying until I master it."
4,Better than most Startup guides,"Woods has written a concise, easy to read and valuable resource for anyone looking for tips on starting your own (ad)venture.It has the usual tales of success and cautions you'd expect from the ""Getting Started"" genre but the concise style and excellent structure (think Dummies Guide without the ""cute"" pictures) means you won't feel you've wasted time on the readIf you are already in business for yourself or are looking for a step by step guide then it's not for you. If you're about to make the jump this could help."
3,Enjoyable space mystery,"A reasonably entertaining light beach read. The characters are two-dimensional, but I'm a fan of lost colony mysteries and this one kept me engaged. The author did a good job of creating a sense of long history between the reader's time and the novel's era, in which many human civilizations have risen and fallen, and the records of the older ones have become sketchy (including that of the United States, which apparently declined into a theocratic dictatorship with a Fox News-like media). It makes me wonder how much of today's recorded information will be lost under the torrent of noise that following centuries will probably unleash. I also enjoyed the author's ideas on what an alien race might be like and his creative use of astrophysics."
4,Another Great McDevitt Book But Too Short!,Another great book by McDevitt; the characters are well-developed and the story is superb. The only flaw in this book is the feeling that it ends way too quickly especially with the buildup. Mr. McDevitt does an excellent job setting the stage for the incredible plot development at the end and we are rushed right through it with no time to enjoy it. I continue to be impressed by the fact that McDevitt writes from the female perspective without it being weird though it does continue to feel awkward to me.
2,disappointed,"I feel so disappointed about this rice cooker. I bough this one based on the good rating and made in Japan. it does the work but after just two months, the inner pot coating started getting off. I called the company. they said they just a retail, anything happened I should contact with the manufactory. then I called the customer service of manufactory. they told me that the inner pot is not included in the warrantees. If I want to get a new one I have to pay $40. I will not recommender people buy this one."
1,Is the Whole Story Being Told>,Can anyone tell me if this story included the part about the victim being involved in a methamphetamine distribution scheme with the two men that beat him to death? Or that the reason he was beaten to death was over the drugs and money and not because he was gay? If this part of the story is not included then I think this book is woefully incomplete.
3,Great - Remnents of early garage bad. Good potential,"i found this Cd in a drawer labeled $1. i must say that it is definately worth it. they start off with some good rifts and they have excellent intros. The vocals leave something to be desired though,. They have good lyrics, but too many crammed into each meter (8count). song three is definately my favorite (actually not a bad song) while song one has the best intro. - enjoy"
4,"Hard to find karaoke tunes, done well!","This was our first foray into using an All Hits karaoke disc, as it had ""She's A Bad Mama Jama"" by Carl Carlton. There were a few tracks that we needed on this disc, and the price point and quality were an overall plus. Also, their version of ""She Blinded Me With Science"" was pretty good. Some of the songs weren't as well done as others, but we were pleased with this find."
1,"Loved the book, hated the movie.","I read the book twice enjoying it both times. After 40 min. of the film I had to stop. Why can't Christians make honest films that aren't mediocre? Furthermore, why do Christians heap high praise on mediocre films? Is it because if it is Christian, it must be wonderful? The film lost me when the dead beat dad pulled some strings to get his son into Reed College without his son's knowledge. Only a person who has never applied to college could even remotely think that that could happen. The film just continues down the road of making a wonderful true story into something you know never could have happened. It was too painful for me to finish."
4,Solid Film,"I've not read the book, ""Blue Like jazz"" so I have nothing to compare it to, with that said, Steve Taylor did a solid job in being me into the story. The characters were complicated enough to keep me interested and his abstract since of imagery is a real plus. This is definitely worth the rent."
3,"I really wanted to like this movie, but...","I love the book ""Blue Like Jazz,"" and love Donald Miller and love Steve Taylor, and WANTED to love this movie, but... I was kinda disappointed. The climax didn't seem that climactic, and the acting wasn't that awesome, and a lot of the situations seemed pretty unbelievable. Overall, I was kinda underwhelmed. :("
5,Great Book = Great movie,"Blue Like Jazz was the first Don Miller book I ever read. (I've read them all since.) I had no idea it had been made into a movie until last night when I was browsing through the movie section at a Safeway market and there it was. I plucked it up and watched it this morning. I loved it. There is a real message here that most faith-based movies aren't delivering. No matter what your spiritual beliefs (or lack there of,) give this one a try. You'll be affected by it."
2,Blue Like Jazz,This move is just not what I thought it was going to be. Very disappointed I thought it was going to be a good Christian movie to watch with Christian friends.
3,Nice for Jack Fanatics: Beware Re-Issues!,"This is the third time around for this concert recording: it was earlier released (truncated to a single CD) as Concert Classics, and then (in the same form) as Doing This.... On Ice.All three versions have an incorrect running order at the end: ""Escape to the Royal Wood (On Ice"") is actually ""Morning Story,"" while ""Morning Story"" is actually ""Tightrope"" (not recorded in the studio until years later, on Monkjack). The first two versions start the latter track 30 seconds into the song; I'm not going to shell out the bucks to see if this version repeats that mistake!To my ears, this is the least essential of the Bruce live albums, but if you're a Jack fanatic it's certainly worth picking up."
4,Album Information,"Recorded 1997* All compositions by Willem van Kruysdijk and Mies Wilbrink except 'Kasesa Sekwassa' and 'A room with three views' co-composed by Ruud Wiener* Produced by Willem van Kruysdijk, Mies Wilbrink and Ed van Otterdijk* Recorded, mixed, edited and mastered by Ed van Otterdijk at van Otterdyke Sound Design, Waalre / The Netherlands* Additional bass guitar by Erik Rooseboom | 'Bubble remix' by Eeg van Kruysdijk* Programming, midi recording and editing by Mies Wilbrink* Sampling by Huub van Dooremalen* Sleeve concept by Willem van Kruysdijk* Sleeve design by Moon* 'Onni doffi's donga is dedicated to Dorothy Kars-Hayter"
1,Cybil . this does not work!,"I have always been a Cybill fan and have seen her perform live on several occasions over a 25 year period, BUT this Cd should never have been released! Her previous CDS I have played and enjoyed, BUT this one is embarassing! Cybill, stick to studio recordings!"
4,works well,It is a bit on the thin side but it hasn't broke on me yet. I had some fitting issues in my 2007 xterra but with a little work it worked out. Not the highest quality but it will work.
5,A must read!,"This book is amazing! Awesome (and I hate the overuse of that word)!A coherent, cogent, realistic look at the status of the US in the world and a proposed strategy that would work."
2,"Great watch, horrible quality","I purchased this for my husband about two years ago. After about two months, the alarm stopped working and the Indiglo stopped working. I figured it was because I purchased it at Wal-Mart on clearance. When I found the same watch on Amazon for roughly the same amount, I bought it for my husband for Christmas. Go figure, about two months later it stopped working again. Again the same issues as before. My husband loves the watch - it has all the features he wanted and looked really nice. I'm really disappointed at this product."
4,timex alarm stainless steel watch,"worked real well, alarm a little to quiet for my hearing. battery lasted a number of years, good value."
2,Ditto,"When sandwich makers don't make actual sandwiches, it comes as an unhappy surprise. Surely the good folks at Continental had a good idea: they just listened to the wrong people. Like so many others."
4,An excellent play with twists at every corner.,"Hamlet was a very good play it kept you interested by throwing a twist in the play at every corner. You never knew what to expect. Cladius was very hard to figure out while you were reading the play and it wasnt till the ""Mouse Trap"" that he showed his true colors. I never knew what to expect in one scene Ophelia was perfectly normal and in the next she was crazy. The one thing that I however disliked was the ending when everybody died, except Horatio and Fortinbras came to take over the government. I think that Horatio should have tried to defend Elsnore. Overall it was a great play which kept you interested throughout and I would enjoy reading more of Shakesphere's plays after reading Hamlet."
3,Blood Valley Review,"The book is a classical western with fast draws and fights. It is written with a formula and predicable fights and battles. It tries to create the good guy, bad guys and the not so very bad people all in one book with some references to Smoke Jenson."
3,If you have money to burn.,"This is a series of sketches by Dick Van Dyke.I am a big fan of Dick Van Dyke, the Dick Van Dyke Show, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins. Mr. Van Dyke has a talent for pantomime and physical comedy among many talents. The most interesting number for me was Dick Van Dyke and the lovely Shirley Jones singing a duet. There wasn't anything on this that wowed me. I have limited funds and would rather have spent my money on something else. If money is no object; then there is some nostalgia here."
2,Unbearably smug suck job,"Why did Schickel write this? After the Griffith book, he should have figured out he's better when he's not grinding axes. I couldn't believe how tedious, fawning, and dishonest the book is -- and I like Eastwood pretty well, although not as much as Schickel. Schickel projects some weird stuff on the guy, who doesn't come off as too smart! (Does Time still let Schickel review Eastwood's films?) I got a lot more out of Sondra Locke's book -- and she's got a screw loose!"
2,Fawning and ridiculous,"Eastwood has always been one of my favorite action stars. Generally a stiff and unsurprising actor, he has played virtually the same character in all his movies. Which is not a problem (for me). My problem is biographies like this one written by Schickel, a usually intelligent and perceptive critic. I'm assuming he had to kiss up to Eastwood in order to get certain information in this book, and his writing reflects this position. Toadish and lacking in objectivity, Schickel finds nothing wrong with Eastwood's constant cheating on his first wife, his inability to work with other directors (he is a control freak), and his hiring of sycophants who would not question his motives--and if they did, they never worked for him again. A major disappointment for anyone seeking an honest evaluation of Eastwood's film career. However, if you worship the ground he walks on--as Schickel obviously does--then this is the book for you!"
1,Mostly an exercise in Schickel's self-aggrandizement.,Schickel seems more interested in demonstrating his 'closeness' to Eastwood and demonstrating his psychoanalytical powers rather than writing an objective biography. Boring! I could hardly stay awake while reading it and I am still having trouble finishing it. And I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan from the days of Rawhide
2,"Disappointly derivative, immature & over-rated","Other reviewers are correct: there is no comparison between this and later Lemonheads' albums such as IASAR. But their reasons are wrong: Creator is the effort that is sorely lacking. Merely OK even for a couple of youngsters, production quality is not so good, as the vocals are not clear on some tracks, and that is a shame because Evan Dando's voice reminds me of Elvis Costello. Furthermore the bass playing cannot hold a candle to Juliana Hatfield's on IASAR. Most of these songs were written by Ben Deily and they just don't hold a candle to Dando's later work. Comparisons of Deily-Dando to other song writing duos are ludicrous; Dando can be reasonably compared to Paul McCartney especially in terms of ""pop sensibility"" but Deily is NO John Lennon. This is of historical interest only, unlike some other band's overlooked early works, such as Green Day's Kerplunk which is indisputably excellent."
2,Short Overall Life of Battery,"I use rechargeable batteries in a digital camera and in a personal CD player (yes, I still have one of those.) While the Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries charged and delivered fine, their overall life (how many times they can be charged) was surprisingly short. I bought a 4-pack of the Energeizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, AA, less than a year ago. They already can no longer be recharged. The Sony AA lithium rechargeable batteries I bought 3 years ago are still fine."
3,SO disappointing for my Mac Magic Mouse,"I purchased a new iMac at the of April, and needed to replace my mouse batteries after 5 weeks. So, someone recommended getting Lithium batteries which I did--and they only lasted 11 weeks! :( For the price I paid, it's definitely not worth it. I'll go back to my AA batteries purchased from C*stc*."
1,Beware of secondary sellers...,"I purchased two 8-packs of AA Energizer Lithium from a supplier named ""Best Deal Supply"" out of Brooklyn, NY. What I received was a plastic tray containing 16 batteries (the right number). But this tray was not sealed and it was capable of holding 20 batteries total. So I have no inkling whatsoever whether the 16 batteries I received were brand new or were partly used or some were new and some were used or what the case might have been. As far as I can tell, these were 16 partially-used batteries and I have no way of telling whether any of them are carrying a full charge or not (short of purchasing some sort of tester and trying them all out). Ordinarily everything I order through Amazon is beyond reproach. But this shakes my confidence a bit. I would recommend avoiding this seller."
5,Good battery,Used these for led string lights that had a timer. I also bought rechargable batteries which is what I will be using from now on.
2,"Marked ""Not for Retail Trade""","I should've read other reviews stating that batteries come repacked in a plain cardboard box, despite the picture showing a sealed retail package. They're also each clearly marked as ""Not for Retail Trade""; which I believe means they aren't supposed to be sold in the manner which they are being sold on Amazon. Now, they may be fine and work as expected, but I have some doubts as to whether they may have been already partially used or originally installed in other equipment. Trouble is, I usually use lithium batteries like these in applications where I don't want to take a chance that they're anything less than 100%. Don't think I'll completely trust them in situations (such as in my underwater camera equipment) where I can't change the batteries immediately if they do prematurely fail."
2,Not Impressed,"I thought that these batteries would (as promised in the advert.)last 8x longer than regular Alkalines - NOT. I guesstimate that I get about 40% more time on both my cameras, but not the 8x promoted. For the price (double to triple the cost)they are not worth it."
5,A rainbow of encouragement in dark times,"This is an uplifting story, based on the suthor's experience of loss and how the light can shine through even when things feel hopeless and dark. The illustrations are charming, full of vibrant colors. Most of all the story is about hope. When you go to your book case and start to look for a book to read, and you see the beautiful purple spine on the book, I guarantee you'll pull it out, re-read it and remember why you treasure it--it leaves you feeling whole and hopeful, and it leaves you with a smile on your face when you close the book and replace it on the bookshelf."
5,Great Product,This item came and it was exactly as I expected based off of the description. I already knew the quality to expect from LorAnn oils and the product I received was genuine.
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book at the library, hoping for a good story, with some hope for the family involved. Instead I was treated to a self-absorbed writers account of her fight with alcoholism and little of her relationship with her sister.I work in a group home setting, and often see families who are not involved, for various reasons. I hoped this book would give me some insight. But it didn't. It offered cliches and explored the rest of the family's surface reactions only. I was disappointed to see that Anne was once more abandoned at the end, when she needed family desperately. The story offered within this book only served to reinforce why I work where I do and why what I am doing is important."
4,A gripping story about bravery,"I suppose MacDonald has written the ultimate book on Heydrich's assassination because there's not much more to tell. The book covers the German entrance into Czechoslovakia, Heydrich rise to the SS-top and the ideas of the Czech government in exile. Only in the final part the actual assault takes place, but by this time the reader has good knowledge of all the circumstances.This gripping story never let's go and is a tribute to all of those who stood up against Nazi evil, personified in Heydrich, and especially to the brave Czechs carrying this action out. The only option to improve this read is to publish it in a more worthy edition: the font looks a bit old and the pictures, which seem to show a lot, are blurred. But don't let this prevent you from reading it!"
1,Check your products prior to shipment,"Dear Sirs:I received my watch in time for Christmas; however, the watch had a dead battery in it when I received it. The instructions were so old they crumbled when I unfolded them, obviously this watch had been sitting in a warehouse for many years prior to shipment. Why didn't anyone check it before it left the warehouse? Bad timing for something like this.Sincerely,Phillip Masters"
4,Excellent balance exercises,"Excellent video; moderately difficult balance exercises. Welcomed addition to your yoga, Pilates, stretching, aerobic, ballet, dance, weight training class. I find these exercises invigorating.Cons: background music makes mental focus and concetration more difficult."
5,A must have for every parent,"Allergies are more common than we think, especially in children. We often hear about kids with reccurent ear infections, chronic stuffy nose, or puffy eyes. We also know at least one hyperactive child, or a child with eczema.This incredible book explains you why there is always an allergy link to the above conditions. It is very sad that most of the conventional doctors today are not aware about this, too.As a mother of a two year old daughter with multiple food allergies, I have been in far too many hospitals in three different countries, searching for an answer to my child's condition. In most of the cases I was completely disappointed. But I have found this book and a great homeopatic doctor who understands and uses Doris Rapp's principles.My daughter is getting better and stronger every day now and even thought she still has some allergies, they are much, much milder than they used to be.I cannot reccomend this book strongly enough."
2,"Interseting anectdotes, unsound science","Good advice on diet and determining food allergies. Unfortunately, the prefered treatment method of Provocation/Neutralization has zero credibility in the medical community. There is no evidence, based on double blind clinical trials, that the method works."
4,Miss the illustrations,"I have loved this book for many years, have reread it numerous times along with the rest of the trilogy. The Kindle version lacks the illustrations and maps to which I would often refer to for reference. Without them it is still a great book, but a little less than I would expect."
2,Too bizarre to be believed,"Great science fiction is a story that has elements that can be believed. Mr Varley has written a fair FANTASY novel, complete with dysfunctional and bizarre main characters. But as a SCIENCE FICTION novel, this book falls far short of the true standard for good science fiction-it is just to weird to be real."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A fairly average story, of an encounter with a strange artifact, whichof course turns out to be alien. It often seems more obsessed with howthe characters look with no clothes on, and whether they are skinnyenough, than with the actual story. Almost a bit like the bad Heinlein.Clearly there is supposed to be sexual role and identity commentary here, but I am not sure it works particularly well."
2,Send me the Hugo,"I guess it's easy to find fault with anything, but I observed two themes with this book that I found unsettling. The first was the sex, which didn't seem to be part of the plot (or maybe I missed that connection) - like who cares who was bonking whom on the ship? The second was the references to movies in the descriptions used - and here I quote - ""Gaea looked a lot like Charles Laughton in 'The Private Life of Henry VIII'"". Hmmm maybe I should write a book like that...The man who looked a lot like Nicholas Cage in 'Face Off' said to the woman who looked a bit like Uma Thurman in 'Pulp Fiction' ""Is that your car? The one that looks a bit like James Bond's in 'Thunderball'""?Where do I pick up the Hugo?"
2,"Fanciful fantasy, not Sci Fi","Have to agree with other the other critical reviewers...very disappointed. Read this after strong recommendation from fellow Dune fan to whom I recommended the Hyperion/Endymion series. This is pretty silly, unsatisfying stuff. If you like explorations through exotic alien landscapes with cartoonish creatures like living dirigibles and 6-legged kangaroos where not much happens, then read on. The characters are flat, there is very little dramatic tension or suspense, or even a plot, and the writing is mundane. Won't bother to read the rest of the series."
3,"Only having read this book, I have mixed feelings..","I've only read Titan, and haven't read any of the other books in the trilogy. This gives me a different perspective from the readers here who obviously appreciate this book for it's overall value in the trilogy; I have no such love for it in that aspect. The book is rather tedious and uninteresting up until the last 20 pages, and doen't really draw your attention until that point. The highlight is the end of the book, which makes the 300 pages up to it seem somewhat worthwhile, and leaves you wanting more. I would not recommend this book to most anyone unless they are willing to commit to finding out what's so ""magical"" in the next 2 books."
5,Great pool!,"This pool is great for us so far. It isn't very deep, which is great for my 2 and 4 year olds. If my 2yo sits down, the water comes up to her chin. It has a drainage plug for the water in the bottom, but it still needs to be poured out by tipping the pool over to get rid of all the water. It feels very durable and I'm extremely happy with the purchase!"
5,Fun Summer with this pool :),"My grandsons & my sons who are both grown men, My husband & I all enjoyed this pool very much. We had great times & the pool was very comfortable for all! I have purchased like 6 pools from amazon but this one was surely my favorite."
3,Semi functional,"Pool is good size for two adults to hang out, or three or four kids to splash about. My number one complaint is no drain plug. This would normally not be an issue, but the pool is heavy when filled, and trying to lift it it is nothing short of slap stick comedy. If you are just going to leave it filled this pool is is a decent choice. If, like us, you need to dump it out because the kids are too young to be around it unattended, then..Id look for a drain plug version."
4,Good product,"Ever since these earphone manufacturers changed to this new design without the soft covering, I've had trouble finding earphones that actually stay in my ears.This set helped out by providing three different (swappable) sizes of the ""rubber"" covering, and they're more firm than another similar-looking set I have. This is good.These earphones aren't perfect, but they have great sound for the low price tag, and after swapping out for the smallest rubber covering, they stay in my ears decently well. It's far more than I can say for most other ""modern"" earphones I've tried. You might have similar luck if you're looking for quality on the cheap."
4,A very thorough book,"This book is very thorough and well researched. The illustrations are very good, though I would have preferred pictures, but it's ok. You do have to learn all the abbreviations by heart, otherwise it will be a little hard to read the entries, because they are all abbreviated. Overall a very good guide to those interested in birds."
1,This book is so disgusting it doesn't belong on Amazon,"""Hungarian Rhapsody"" is a graphic novel that shows explicit sex and other inappropriate images. Furthermore, it has no artistic strong points -- it is amateurishly drawn and has a bizarre plot. Great graphic artists like Herge never had to resort to the twisted to tell a story, and their pictures are beautiful, too. Never read this book."
3,Good documentary,"This was a an interesting and entertaining documentary of a man that some would say was misunderstood, struggling to make his dream come true. I see it a as story about a man who puts his dream before family to the point of causing a divorce and is made out to be the victim. So it was a good story of morals and ethics, one that I bought hoping more for the demolition derby side of it, but was mildly disappointed. They only showed small portions of the demos. A good story, good filming, one I might watch once in a great while, but nothing real amazing."
4,Good bang for the buck,Simple install with built-in safeguards.Very attractive.Needs no outside vent but warns if low oxygen.Reasonable price for a good heater for a 400 square footguest house.
1,book review,"I was disappointed with the quality of the paper used for the book, but was satisfied with the quick response to getting my refund."
5,delightful,I don't recall now if this is the first or second book I read by CCJames. She's delightfully easy to read and yet profoundly thought-provoking. Christian women everywhere will be inspired by her scholarship and encouraging words.
5,for all mothers and daughters,"As a grandmother ( and not of adopted children,) I had to buy many copies of this charming and moving book. It should make all of us realize the gift of a child. I have bought it for several and recommended it to many. I too wept for the mother who gave up her baby as I celebrated the tender love of the mother who found her. Thanks to the author for a moving story."
4,Enlightening,"This book relied quite a bit on common sense to inform the reader. I was interested in becoming acquainted in the mindset of an expatriat. I did not feel I learned much outside of common sense. However, if you are about to travel for business for a long time, I can see how this book would get you mentally prepared and maybe think of something you hadn't accounted for otherwise."
2,"Love the game, but...","I originally played this game on the Sony Playstation, and was hooked instantly. I got really caught up in the game while staying at my friend's house for a couple days. When it was time to go home, I was most of the way through the game, and really wanted to know how it ended, but unfortunately I didn't own a Playstation. Eventually I bought it for the PC, thinking it would be even better on the PC, as everything is better on the PC. But it wasn't. I have a 32 MB video card, and a system far superior to what it's looking for. But the graphics were large and blocky, completely losing any beauty to the game, and the cutscenes kept locking up on me initially. But I stuck with it and beat the game, because I wanted to know how it ends. I love the game, and I love the series, but don't buy this game for the PC. I was pretty disappointed. I hope Res Evil 3 is better for the PC."
1,resident evil,"I meet and exceed the system requirements and can't get the stupid thing to run right. No sound, open driver error message, support offers none either. and that's with or without voodo 5500 3D accelerator. I want my money back.."
1,Incredibly frustraing!,"This game, while a decent port from the PS version as far as a port goes, is very frustrating. First it's difficult to learn and play, and the graphics sometimes makes gameplay even more difficult. (BTW, it's not really scary.) The most annoying thing for PC gamers is you can't save the game at any point. Instead there are only a limited number of occasions where you can save your progress. The novelty factor is no longer than as there was with the original RE (which was not as novel as the truly original Alone in the Dark)."
5,Good stuff,"I have always liked the way the series has been presented. Season 3 is another great entry into an equally great series. It is always good for a certain level of creepiness without getting too gory or bloody. Each episode is great to watch and they do not get old, regardless of how many times you watch them. Sit back and enjoy the scare."
5,Haunting,"After reading the negative feedback regarding Seasons 1 & 2 on Amazon, I too went elsewhere to buy my DVD. However, I did pre-order Season 3 (from Amazon) and hoping that the Audio portion is done correctly this time, let's keep our fingers crossed"
3,Not for everyone,"The photography is beautiful. But understand that this book is asort of bio of emotions about growing up gay, not about building and decorating dollhouses."
3,acceptable,item came in really fast and was easy to install. because it's attached to the car body it doesn't cover very much of the window and I wonder if it was really worth putting on my car. somewhat disappointing...
2,what's the font?,"it would be nice to know what typeface or family or anything about the type being presented. kind of useful for quick ideas, but not really much for understanding the fonts themselves."
4,Not as great as the first two but a lot better than what came next,"While I much prefer the first two albums to this one, Lick is still a pretty good record. Sadly, there's much less noise, urgency, and punkish energy on this record than their earlier ones but, again, compared to the long line of crappy releases that followed this, Lick is still a lot better. I'm willing to bet that if you love the later mellower Lemonheads sound, you probably won't like Lick. Personally, I feel that after this record the quality of the Lemonheads music took a huge nosedive and has never recovered. Thanks a lot Evan Dando!"
2,batteries,Beware the ridiculous shipping charge since it came from a different location than the toy I purchased. Definitely not worth what it ended up costing.
5,Great Watch,I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my mother. She loved it!!!! It is very pretty and easy to read.
2,Cheaply made,"The lamp is not of good Quality, within 2 days the clamping device broke due to the fact that its made out of cheap plastic, within the 4th day the sauder joint that joins the wire to the light socket was loose and I had to resauder it."
3,Take it or leave it,"The base is very light and the top heavy is alot heavier therefore, making the unit very unsteady and wobbly."
1,DeAngelis's first loser,"I can't believe it! A book from DeAngelis I don't like! I'm shocked and very disappointed.When I pick up one of her books, I expect to be able to sink my teeth into some practical life advice, backed up by solid psychology. Not so this book!How Did I Get Here is filled with esoteric, quasi metaphysical cum Christian mumbo jumbo, with a whole lot of self-validation. (Lots of testimonials on how great she is - very disappointing.) It's like she's thinking out loud, or having a discussion with a room full of PhDs with a contest to see who can use the biggest words. Every chapter could be distilled into one paragraph, and the rest is fluff and repetition.If that weren't bad enough, the copyright is 2005, so I have a bad feeling this may be her new writing stye. <Gasp> Has success spoiled Beverly DeAngelis? Is she gunning for an honorary PhD somewhere and this is her thesis?This one I'm skimming, then donating. I'm picky about what I keep on my shelves."
5,Amazing Book!,"I have read a book or two from this author in the past that I felt were pretty good but, this new book is very powerful. I felt that she was writing the book for me! I reccomend this book to anyone trying to make positive personal change in their life. Wether we are talking about relationships or going through a life change this book is a must have!"
5,My favorite punk rock album of all time,"- Burning In Water that is. The fact that any fan of aggressive, tuneful rock music can acquire two albums' worth of pure gold like this for $12 just blows my mind."
4,Mass Exam Review,I really liked this book. It helped me learn things the classroom didn't. I do suggest when studying this book you study the state in which your from AND the national part till you know it!
2,You really can't taste that?,"I am forcing myself to drink this-the taste is pretty bad. Its got an after taste that is very earthy...not in the good way. I imagine ""pot-brownies"" tasting something like this-blech! Sometimes I throw in a tablespoon of instant coffee to help cover the flavor-and I guess it works. After drinking it I am so disgusted that I can not imagine eating anything : )"
1,The worst acupuncture book I have ever seen.,I did agree with Mark's view of acupuncture. His way will kill and hurt the patient than helping the patient. You will find non scientific approach and poor explanation throughout the text. He is not a qualified treating any patient.
2,Nonessential reading for the Little Big Horn student,"Books about the Battle of the Little Big Horn are almost without number (I should know; I am at present writing my own!) and unfortunately not all of them are particularly insightful or informative. I am sorry to say that in my opinion Combs's ""Where Was Custer?"" is among this latter group. I think he is too enraptured by those Indian narratives presented by David Humphreys Miller, for one thing (Indian narratives can have great value in deciphering what happened at the Little Big Horn, but Miller's are perhaps not among the most reliable). And Combs' conclusion as to what specifically happened to George Custer is neither original nor especially convincing. There are much better books available about these events/"
4,Fun and Informative!,A great detailed account of the epic battle from the men who fought in it. Rich with information with the flow of a story book - great balance and a great piece of literature.
5,plain tales of the rajh,"just plain excellant,with a mason foreward to boot should be on every shelf on lndian history the final chapters were the best....thanks"
2,Disappointed,I don't want to give the book a bad write up because it's very well written. My problem is simple; too many references to god and religion. Don't get me wrong I am a believer in god; but I didn't buy the book with that in mind...
3,Good Documentary,This is a good video that shows how America supports illegal immagration instead of trying to fight it by offering work halls.
5,Leninism?,"Leninism? Did the other reviewer even read the book? Lloyd discusses the US left's rejection of traditional marxism (not leninism) in favor of Dewey influenced pragmatism. Leninism (really, any aspect of it) has little to do with the book, especially since much of the book covers the American Left BEFORE the rise of Lenin to power."
3,Going Back In Time,"The music is good, it just is not the original versions of the musicthat I was hoping for. The songs have been made more modern. I preferthe original versions of the songs."
5,Special Relativity and Motions Faster than Light,"Everybody knows that motion of objects with the speed faster than light is impossible.Dr. Moses Fayngold wrote a 309-page book about superluminal motions. Not a science fiction work, not a fantasy, but a book on special relativity written by a theoretical physicist, an expert in this field. It is as serious and accurate as a scientific journal publication, and as absorbing and entertaining as a good scientific popularization. Among hundreds books on relativity this one is special. It covers a variety of topics, including the most recent ones that could not always be found in the classical publications. I read it with increasing interest, gave it to my colleagues, and would recommend it to both professionals and students.Many will be surprised to find in the book something they had not even thought about. I am sure that the book will have more editions.Prof. Edward ParilisCalifornia Institute of Technology"
5,Wonderful.,"Excellent perspective on marriage as a whole. Homos and heteros alike can benefit tremendously from this book. While it reads as a fun novel, this book truly could be regarded with the same respect as a text book. It dissects many of the underlying issues related to marriage that almost ALL people should at the very least be aware of, if not take time to consider and discuss with their spouse or potential spouse."
3,It feels like a family history...,"The book reads as more of a family history... a moderately interesting verbal slideshow about his immediate family, his grandparents, parents, and siblings. It's written well and is interesting, but I see a number of 5 star reviews and I can't imagine it will improve to the point where I would even consider giving it 4 stars.I saw Savage's interview on the Colbert Report... and Savage himself is more interesting than the book."
5,Keep laughing,I've read other books by Dan Savage and enjoyed them immensely. 'The Commitment' did not disappoint. It kept me laughing for most of the book. Of course there was plenty of seriousness and good insight into how relationships and families have evolved over the past few generations also. I wanted to stay up reading it as soon as I started!
3,Too many typos,"Maybe it was my copy but I felt the editing was horrible. I would read a sentence and had to go back because words had not been taken out. I don't have an example (as I am done reading the book) but if I were to go back I am sure I would find over 20 such instances.I enjoyed his writing and the subject matter. Only I don't think the publisher/editor read the book. It was as though it had been edited by spell check, which we all know does not pick up everything. I can honestly say I have never read a book with typos so it was amazing and annoying. I thought How lazy is that? It's an injustice to the reader. We expect the English language to be used correctly when buying a book.I found that instead of telling friends about the subject matter and the book itself, I was discussing how appalling the errors were.Overall, it's good reading."
1,Lt. Columbo Teaches Hydroponics,"After seeing a friend's copy of Saffell's book all I can say is ""thank heaven I didn't buy this!"" Hilmur possibly is a great hydroponicist and insightful marketer of plant materials; but after submitting to his stumbling, barely-linear ramblings and tangential explainations if felt like a murder suspect zeroed in the sights of Lt. Cloumbo. ""Oh yea, just one more thing..sorry I didn't mention it before..just a loose end to tie up...""For the beginning hydroponics practitioner who might find Howard Rush's HYDROPONIC FOOD PRODUCTION: A Definitive Guidebook of Soilless Food-Growing Methods a little too much in detail and information, I recommend his simpler and more hobby/home gardener oriented HYDROPONICS: Questions And Answers for Successful Growing. Don't waste your time or money on Saffell's Shoe Strings!"
1,NOT what you might think it is,"This is an eSATA cable, with eSATA connectors on both ends.The title of this item made me think it was a cable to connect a SATA device to an eSATA port. NO! It has an eSATA connector on each end. The bag it came in was labeled ""0.5M ESATA/ESATA BLACK CABLE"", which would be a better name for this item. I pointed this out to Amazon, but they want me to send various documentation to *prove* that the listing title is somehow wrong. Technically, yes, an eSATA cable *is* a SATA cable. But it is misleading. It's not worth returning, but I can't tell you anything about the quality, since I have no use for it (currently). I gave it one star in the hopes that someone else might read my review before ordering, and avoid the mistake I made."
3,How do you put this thing together,"We are happy with the Unicycle. However, when we received it there were NO directions on how to put it together. I emailed the supplier who NEVER responded to me which was fustrating!!!!"
2,Maybe Worth $6,"This 3-disc collection is passable for someone who has never seen any military video. Anyone who has seen Victory At Sea, World At War, Air Power or any of the other good military histories will be bored with this collection which includes a lot of the same video as above. Some of the video is poor, the narration is total ""navy"" and leaves out important facts related to Marines who were also involved in some events. The episode about ""Greyhounds of the Sea"" is very thin on actual destroyer video. Some of the episodes duplicate video from other episodes. The latest time period for this collection is around 1990. I gave it 2 stars because there are 3 discs, otherwise I would have given one star."
2,Ray,I did not care for this novel. Too much profanity and glorification of sexually irresponsible behavior for my taste. Also the style is rather choppy and tedious --- like wading through a stagnant swamp.
3,quality,the quality/resolution wasn't amazingi was under the impression that the megapixels would suffice for video chat.. i was expecting better quality
1,Worst webcam you can buy!,"Installation is anightmare, it forces you to install windows live, even if you dont want to, then, it has this button on it's top that pops windows live when you push it, it is in a very strategic position, so you press it a lot by mistake, and there pops windows live!, it's really bad in very bright conditions or slightly dark ones, has a lot of hickups when connected to skype, there are many other, much better webcams with no forced features and software"
4,"Little webcam, large satisfaction",Terrific webcam for the money. Allows enjoyment of distant grandson. You will need to spend a great deal more money to get something better.
4,the Lifecam,"I have been using the cam for nearly a month, and I have seen that it rally works well for IM purposes. This is not a really sophisticated device but the resolution is quite good. It's worth its price."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I ordered this webcam based on the ratings. It was not working properly and I took my computer (which is new) back to the store and was told it was sent with old software. They installed the new software but the cam freezes when I use it on Yahoo Messenger. None of my friends with cams have this problem. I was told to try Skype, but I don't know anybody else who uses that program. So, I have a web cam that is useless to me. I would not recommend this product."
2,Jerkiest web cam i've seen,"mmmm.... jerky .... i love jerky - but not in my video.Audio was fine... button too easy to hit (as others have said)... at least it semi-worked with XP x64....I had to return mine - the video was so jerky it looked like an old school slide projector presentation. (Not old-school - like science class in the 70s!)I'm Microsoft's smallest fan for the most part, but if the video had been closer to fluid, i would have kept it and used it."
1,Couldn't get the microphone to work,"I was in need of two webcams. I bought this (the Microsoft LifeCam) and a less expensive webcam, a generic Flexible 5.0 Megapixel USB PC Camera with Microphone. The generic webcam was super easy to install and the sound worked great! The Microsoft LifeCam requires software installation, and I could not get the sound to work at all. I was very disappointed. Perhaps it was just this camera and the rest are better, but I am returning the LifeCam and getting two of the other."
4,assessment of lifecam vx-1000,"I was extremely satisfied with this camera;it was good value for money and performed well in use.The only point I felt it lacked,was a hook bracket to fit it to the top edge of my monitor screen.However as I had a shelf conveniently situated above my monitor,this didn't matter.The promptness of the delivery was also a large plus in its favour.All in all I felt it was a very good buy and would recommend the product and the supplier to anyone thinking of purchasing such an item."
1,Rollin,I though this was the lamest cd that L.B. made. I am really dissappionted of them. I exppected better.
3,Good resolution but fuzzy text,"Even running at its dazzling native resolution, image quality is what I consider ""below-average"", i.e., when compared to other LCD monitors. If you want a large size and high resolution, the HP is a good choice. But, HP's dead pixel policy is less than generous."
5,Rare Jewels,"There be rare jewels here.They're all great encores by the greatest violinists of the 20thcentury. I wish Fritz Kreisler had been represented by a piecethat isn't so overplayed. There are gems in this set, every one of them, but you have to hear Ricci in 'Burleska'; such amazing incisiveness and bite (accompanied by his teacher, Louis Persinger !!). I wouldn't blame you if you listen to Amazon'smusic links here over and over. These guys are the best !!Foreign violinists, save Francescatti are probably under-represented here."
2,A Hilarious Bore,"When I picked up the book, I was debating on whether or not it would be good. After reading, I'm still wondering if it was worth the read.The book has a very slow beginning. This slow beginning leads to an even slower plot development. The novel lacks action and the climax was more like that of rising action. There is the hint of wonder on whether or not Dan gets the girl, but nothing to keep one turning the pages. The ending was quick, rushed, yet to the point. I guess it's to make up for the lack of substance in the novel.However, on the bright side the book is very funny. It's edgy and Dan has a comical view on life. He analyzes everything, even the way he puts on his shoes. Many a time you will find yourself laughing at one Dan's thinking. But, there wasn't a connection with any of the characters so they and the book aren't worth remembering."
3,Interesting Book,48 shades of brown is unlike any book that i've read before. i thought the way the quthor expressed the guys thoughts was differant and funny. i had never read a book before that had a boys life instead of a girl. some of the parts were very funny and i enjoyed reading it. it is a book for people who just want something differant and for the most part easy to read. at parts it got confusing but overall it was a good book. i would say anyone who wants a fun read would like it.
2,Can't read the display,"I was not happy with this watch. I purchased it and returned it the next day. The display is so difficult to read I have to tilt my wrist to catch the light just perfectly to see the silver numbers. The back light was pretty whimpy as well and did not help much in the dark. The watch has all the functions I could want and is a metal bracelet with a digital face, but it just took too long to try and figure out the time and anything in smaller numbers/letters was almost impossible to read. It is quite large for a women's watch as well. It is chunky and sits up pretty high off your wrist. Casio is a good brand and I'm sure it's a great watch, I just could not read it without 30 seconds of struggling. I've ordered another Casio watch because I love the functionality with the classy look, but I want to make sure I can tell the time when I need to and not worry about the lighting in the room."
4,"Sound, practical advice","Both students and working professionals will find much to learn in this college textbook. The writing and process guidelines are sound, detailed, and practical. The numerous examples and tips for writing different types of PR materials are very helpful for understanding their purpose and use. However, the chapters on writing marketing materials detract from the focus of the book and offer necessarily limited info. Writing skills for these materials are best learned in other, marketing-focused books where they can receive a full presentation."
5,Great little bag.,"I've been using this bag for a couple weeks now. The materials it is made of appear vintage but sturdy. I personally like the feel of the cloth. The design is of course a personal preference, but I like it and it looks good how it was done. I'm tall (6'5"") so having a longer shoulder strap would have been nice, but whatever, for this price I'll deal with it and not complain. Overall I'm very happy. If you're just looking for something to chuck a couple books in and maybe some headphones it works great."
1,Mediocre at Best,"Started out well, then about three weeks into using it, the sides ripped. This bag cannot hold up the stress of carrying a macbook pro, an organic chemistry book, and two 0.5"" binders. Honestly, it's a good bag if you don't carry very much with you, but otherwise, this bag seriously blows for school usage."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","First off I did not receive the item that is pictured so buyer beware you are not getting the item that is pictured. The bag that I did get only has two pockets the main compartment and then another small pocket in front of it. This bag is TERRIBLE it is made of cheap flimsy material and I will no doubt be sending it back. The strap is thin and will assuredly dig into your shoulders if you put any short of weight into the bag, there is absolutely no padding to speak of, furthermore the bag feels like its gonna rip in half anytime i put something the size of a textbook into it DO NOT BUY THIS BAG, you have had fair warning."
2,Photo misleading,Ordered the olive drab Israeli Paratroop messenger bag. The photo associated with it does not include the absurd cranberry pink stylized parachute on the cover flap. I am not about to walk around with this thing. Maybe someone else finds it attractive but they should at least see what they are being sold before deliver.
3,"Ok, not great",I purchased this bag only because I wanted to put pins and patches all over it. When I got it I was disapointed becuase the color wasn't anything like the Khaki in the picture. I tried to put my make-up bag in it with everything else I carried but I made it look werid. I still enjoyed the bag great for shopping at the mall.
4,Good for my iPad,"I bought the bag to carry my iPad, and it's working nicely. The bag is light, but sturdy. It easily holds my iPad, an umbrella, paperback, and assorted goodies. It's not padded and offers little physical protection, but I knew that from reading other reviews. I'm pleased with it and could see myself buying another one to keep in reserve.I refuse to call it a ""murse"" or ""man bag,"" though. Heh. It's just... my bag."
4,Snap Broke :(,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves the bag! Right off the bat you can tell this bag is very durable and will last a long time. My only complain is after just a day of using the bag one of the side snaps broke. I think it was probably just a fluke since I didn't see a warning of this in other reviews. He didn't see it as too big of a deal though and will be keeping it.
2,map case,"Nice bag, but it' a map case. numerous pencil holders, large interior spaces, like they said a good book bag. But nothing else. Unless you carry a lot of maps that is."
3,"keychain fell apart, bag starting to fall apart","I chose this rating beause the bag is starting to fray I do like the color, not as sturdy as it looks but overall good bag"
2,Good scenary boring plot,"Donne-moi la main is Pascal-Alex Vincent's 9th film. Vincent is perhaps best known for his 2007 film ""Candy Boy."" In ""Donne-moi la main,"" he casts identical twins (Alexandre and Viktor Carril) to play identical twins. The story revolves around twins who are 18, and on their way to their mother's funeral in Spain without their father's knowledge. As they don't have money, they must hitchhike. On the way, they encounter people who bring something to their lives. There is the girl with whom one of them sleeps despite the fact that the other has bonded with her. Then there is the Arab guy with whom one of the twins has an interesting sexual experience. From these encounters we see their common alienation is also what puts the boys at each other's way. As with many indie French films, this film is a bit boring. There are long moments of silence. The characters are never fully developed. It is in fact a better film to watch for the scenery than the plot."
2,I really liked it....it was most informative and entertaining,"Todays headlines show ultra sound depicting twins in the womb fighting and punching each other,,,Twins have always beeninteresting read and study...also headlines told of near fifty yr old twin girls spending their entire lives together and dyingtogether....never needing a boy friend or evidently anything more than each other's love...both the boys impressed me asvery good for their age at acting....i enjoyed it and also was affected by it"
4,Good old Country,"A lot of his old stuff. If you like classic George Jones and his old duets, this is a must. I like most of the songs."
1,less than acceptable packaging,The product's box was very battered when I recived it. The corners were crushed and the plastic had smudges all over it. There was even leftover paper and adhesive from where the price stick had been removed. It looked they shipped me an item that someone else had returned after they abused it.
2,Looks cool but not super functional.,"This watch is really cool and I get tons of compliments when I wear it. I have a pretty extensive watch collection, and I like to wear this when I'm doing outdoorsy stuff. However, I haven't been able to figure out how to adjust the time. Over time, it seems to be about 10 minutes fast which totally makes this almost useless. Also, it seems to label time zones by airports, and it doesn't adjust for daylight savings. I am in CA and there is both an SFO and an LAX setting, for what reason I have no clue because both are on Pacific Standard Time. However, during daylight savings I have to switch to DEN time, which is pretty lame considering I am nowhere near Denver. Overall this watch is pretty cheap and I didn't expect much out of it. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I still think it's a cool accessory."
1,A piece of junk,"I should've paid more attention to the reviews for this item before purchasing. It is a piece of junk. I tried to use it for two separate video cards' outputs to two separate monitors, and still got no signal. How hard is it to make a working adapter!? I will never buy another StarTech product. They should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Seagate ST303204N1A1A-RK 320 GB Ultra ATA/100 Internal Hard Drive,"Good hard drive, tested with operating system, and without (just for storage). However giving 4 stars, for annoying light noise sometimes."
3,Sountrack rocks..,"But that is about it. Again another great concert destroyed by the fact that video editors seem to think we like watching concerts at 200 different camera angles a minute. Packaging claims to put you in the front row, well it does that as well as the back, the sides, the balcony, floor and stage a few times a minute so much so it is unwatchable.But the music itself is awesome, great mixing and quality.Someday I hope that those making concert videos will take the time and watch them themselves, it really ruins a good show.Bottom line music is classic powerful Maiden.Video, with all the great camera angles they had to work with I wish they would have slowed down the transitions at least a little so we could enjoy them."
5,MAIDEN SLAYS,"I was lucky enough to receive this before it was pulled. I somewhat agree with the opinions of others about the quick editing. I will say in that like others have mentioned, the fast editing is really only evident at the beginning of the dvd and with time slows down to where it is much more easy on the eyes. The set list is amazing. Yes, some repeats. However, being the only dvd containing the tracks from the awesome Dance of Death disc and the spectacular stage presentation, I feel money was well spent. Great sound as well. Maiden will always be heads and shoulders above any metal band. UP THE IRONS!"
1,HORRIBLE!!! MAJOR PRODUCTION ISSUES!! BEWARE!!!,"This is such a mess I don't even know where to start. You want a good representation of Iron Maiden live, I'm afraid this isn't it. The editing is poor and that's being too kind to say. There are major glitches in the replication of this that cause it to skip and jump and I even exchanged it once only to have the issues repeat in the same spots even on 3 seperate DVD players all of different brands in my home and office. I think this is even addressed on Iron Maiden's own site.In the rush for revenue it would appear quality takes a backseat these days as the latest Whitesnake live DVD also suffers the same manufacturing flaws and a statement on Whitesnake's site also addresses this. You would think when you drop $15-$23 on a DVD that it would work and more respect would be given to us buyers however my local Best Buy actually STOPPED CARRYING and SENT BACK both this Iron Maiden DVD and the Whitesnake because of the vast returns."
1,wrong,i order gummy BEARS not gummy WORMS!! very upset they sent me the wrong thing. i had a themed party of gummy bears and the worms threw it all off. i was very disappointed. and on top of that they came late!!
2,Unimpressive Performance,"The backcover emphasised that Ms Dragoni bears a strong resemblance to Maria Callas. Upon watching the DVD, I realised that it meant the pre-diet Callas. If only her voice had similar resemblance too!. Ms Dragoni as Norma had difficulty handling the long-breathed melodies of Bellini, and as the opera went on, she became increasingly short of breathe and gaspy. The Adalgisa was harsh and shrill all the time, and was very stiff in her acting. The remainder of the singers are unmemorable.Of the recent productions, that featuring Theodossiou is the better one despite, as Mr Rishoi said, being very provincial. The one featuring Papian is a horrible travesty (the production, that is). Lets wait for the up and coming one with Gruberova in the title role."
1,A TOTAL PRODUCTION DISASTER.,THE SOUND QUALITY WAS VERY POOR. TURNING UP THE VOLUME ONLY MADE THE HUMMING LOUDER. I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE EFFORT PUT FORTH BY THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO. I COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH A COMPLETE VIEWING AND TOSSED THE DISC IN THE TRASH. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE HOLOCAUST AND THE COMPOUND AT DACHAU DESERVES MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN THIS. THE NARRATOR WAS BARELY AUDIBLE ON MY COPY. JERRY W IN TX.
5,Tai Chi,"If your looking for very careful, understanding and patient lessons from a very experienced man then this DVD is the ticket. I love the way he lays this all out, and breaks the steps down into segments that you will practice before putting all your moves together in one shot. Excellent teacher!"
3,So-So,"As a complete Tai-Chi novice, I was looking for something basic that would just teach me the forms.I bought this and Chao Pang's ""Tai-Chi: Stillness Through Motion."" That disc is a lot more in-depth. In purchasing Tai Chi for Beginners, I wanted to counterbalance that with something simpler.This disc definitely is simpler. The instruction is very ""left foot here, right arm there"" which I kinda like. The problem for me though is that the instructor is facing the camera so his movements are hard to mimic.I feel like I really need something with multiple camera angles, especially a rear-angle.If you're spatially-challenged (like maybe I am), you might struggle with this.Honestly my experience with this disc as well as the Chao Pang has lead me to think the only way to learn Tai Chi is with a personal instructor. But maybe it's just me! I will keep looking for a DVD that features multiple and ideally simultaneous camera angles."
3,Tai Chi DVD,This is my first experience with Tai Chi and so far Chris Pei is very easy to understand. He makes it very doable and hopefully I will be able to do it regularly as he suggests.
3,Mirror the Tai Chi,"Chris Pei was articulate and precise with the instructions. However, it was very difficult to follow the instructions & movements as it is not mirrored. It was very confusing. Of course after receiving the DVD, a revised edition was just released."
3,HARD TO FOLLOW,"I have only used this product one time. However, I found it a little difficult to follow. Even though he moves slowly, it is hard to transfer what I am seeing on the screen to the moves that I should be making. I will try it again and maybe it will be a bit easier to catch on."
3,Improve Your Relationship,"This book was bought as a gift and it was well received. As I was told, the book is specific and detailed and not for shy and light hearted. Must be willing to improve the relationship to value this book. Delivery was prompt and in good condition to a deployed location. As seen on OPRA, the author has a reputation that preceded the name, so in all a good purchase so far."
3,The Passion Prescription,"I was curious about this book, but I don't think that I learned much that I had not known before. Probably a good book for anyone that hasn't had a relationship in a long time or someone that was in a not very satisfying one."
1,tarnishes immediately,"this product tarnishes immediately just from the air, I haven't put human hands on it. This is very disappointing"
2,Christians Will Not Like This Book,"I was looking forward to reading the first book in the China Bayles series. However, I discovered the book is filled with profanity. I know that doesn't bother most people but I, as a Christian, do not use profanity, and I certainly don't want it in the books I read. For that reason, and the mild detailed sexual encounters, I did not finish this book. I tossed it and the second book in the trash. I suppose profanity in books is a matter of course now days but not in my house. Too bad Miss Albert did not think of synonyms for the profane words and using the Lord's name as a cuss word. Using proper language would not have detracted from the story but for me the profanity did."
1,Just not interested,"The plot was fine and it did keep me reading until the end (I hate giving up on a book) but I really hate being hit over the head with the feminist, lesbian, do-gooder greenie stuff so I probably will not read another China Bayles mystery again."
3,Surya's Review,"Book starts ambitious and it is thrilling at times. But concept doesn't seem as deep as Davinci, but sure it would be better Movie than Davinci."
3,It isn't all that great!,"Hi, that book isn't all that great. It sucks really. I bought it and it sucks! All i'd have to do was listen to my friend! I learned faster than from that book. But then again, I only have 8 pokemon cards."
3,"Average, at best.","As anyone who reads this book will find, the colors, info., and pictures are all a sloppily thrown on the pages. Its a real shame to. This book had the potential to be a great guide. The Pokemon that are reviewed at the end, is horrible. It's hard to understand and read.... Too bad. I guess the only good thing is the tips and info (Understandable info, that is)."
3,"A little DEJA-VUE, but not bad for the price","Data on all 150 POKEMON, but there is another book that I find more through. The Official POKEMON Strategy guide has, in my opinion, a better and more complete layout of the game."
3,Not a bad book but Nintendo's version is the best,I thought the book was a good book for ten bucks but there weren't enough maps and the book was very thin compared to Nintendo's own player's guide. The pictures are very nice as well as information about the Pokemon in the game. It still isn't a bad book because there is enough information to beat the game.
5,The sweetest music for quiet time just before snoozing.,I first bought the cassette tape in 1993. I'm glad the album is still available; it seemed to disappear for a while. This is a must-have for every babe's collection!
1,Won't shut off; terrible customer service,"I bought this hard drive three months ago. Three calls to Maxtor's technical ""support"" later, it still won't shut off so that I can remove it from my computer after I'm done backing up my data. In order to remove it safely, I have to restart my system. Sometimes the backup program occupies 98-99% of my computer's memory, making other applications freeze, and the process responsible for taking up all that memory can't be shut - even after restarting. Imagine a program that, once open, won't respond to a ""quit"" command or CTRL-ALT-DEL ... that's this drive.And the ""support"" - if you like waiting on hold for 45 minutes to talk to someone in India whose English is, shall we say, rather idiosyncratic, then I strongly recommend that you buy something from Maxtor. As for me, in the future I'll take the risk that my computer gets stolen or burns up in a fire rather than spend another dollar on Maxtor's junk."
3,"Good exercises, but bad camera work","I have been doing this workout for over a month now. I own many workout DVDS so have seen my fair share of different workout videos. While I really like the actual exercises in this video, the camera drives me crazy at certain points. It seems to zoom in on weird/irrelevant parts when showing a new exercise. Even after watching this so many times, I still need to see what I should be doing and I feel this video is lacking in that at several points. I would still recommend this video, but be warned! Basically every time I do this video I get annoyed by the camera work, which lead me to feeling the need to write this review."
1,Lightweight but useless,"I bought it from a salon that did a nice microcurrent facial on me. She raved about it, saying it was just as good as some Collin GM gel. I had never tried either, but I trusted the facialist.It has been only 3 weeks and I already ran out of this. I first used only on the fine lines around my mouth, but since I didn't see any result, I started using on my face, twice daily. It dried fast and my face was smooth to touch but there were no visible improvements.Now that it ended, I feel cheated on because there were no changes and I don't feel like spending another 50+ dollars getting a new one.No wonder it has been discountinued.If you are in need of a serum that REALLY works, get the Qeautie Facial Serum Cream (comes in a red heart-shaped capsules) on Ebay. Only 12 bucks and totally worth it!"
3,Guru Guru - 'Shake Well' (Revisited),"Early '90's Guru Guru release. A decent effort and all, it JUST doesn't sound anything like any other Guru Guru release I've ever heard. More in the progressive vein, but the band themselves call this music 'psychedelic ethno rock'. Better cuts here to be heard are ""I Want You"", the well-paced ""Mystery Train"", the somewhat tripping ""Monkey Dance"" (maybe the CD's best cut) and the live cut of the Guru Guru gem ""Ooga Booga"". Line-up: Mani Neumeier-percussion&vocals, Luigi Archetti and Hans Reffert-guitars and Razem Rubel-bass&vocals. Give it a shot."
2,ok has a slight smell and taste,"it's just OK. I wouldn't order it again, but I will use it, heck, I paid for it"
4,great book,"Great book for information purposes. Just wanted to read something different and I really enjoyed the book. If traveling to the middle east, I would recommend reading this book."
1,Only One Word Can Describe This Collection......,"Dreadful.If you want Fuzzbox on CD, Buy BIG BANG!. Don't waste your money here."
2,Where's the beef?,There is nothing in this book that would help a person who would be interested in surgery. He gives a lot of his own tales and it is rather a snobish account of his life. I would not pass this on to a friend.
1,learned my lesson with amazon,"shoot me if i ever buy through amazon again. they don't have what they advertise, they don't have it at the price they advertise and they don't send it anywhere near the time they say they will.i learned my lesson!"
5,A revelation,"This CD uses a period instrument which produces a very different sound from the classical guitar people are used to today and has to be appreciated from the perspective of historically informed performance practice. If you are already used to music from the early Romantic and classical periods played authentic style I would be very surprised if you didn't enjoy this CD, particularly as the music itself is brilliant. If you're bothered by the sound of a finger sliding up and down a wound string, however, I suggest Chet Atkins."
5,Yum,"This is about my favorite quick treat of all. It is very spicy and gingery, but if you like that taste you can't do better than this little gem."
3,dbliners in germany,"The disc contained a list of titles which we assumed would be sung in full but in fact several are only snapshots, a few bars of the tune or the end of the item in a concert. slightly disappointing"
3,Spicy!,"I remember trying one as a child.. SPICY! I spat it out instantly because the ginger flavor is so overwhelmingly strong. People seem to love it though, but it doesn't suit my palate."
2,Not a good book for self-study by beginners in PDE,"I have an engineering background and tried to study PDE myself, but didn't find the book as helpful as expected. As described in another review, the books seems to explain many topics in an unnecessarily complicated manner. Perhaps people with better math background can appreciate it better, but I would not recommend it to beginners."
1,Review what?,"Can't review a product that offers no details, and seller will not respond to questions about it. It is ""Used"", some details should be expected."
3,These are not your best option.,"I got these some time ago. I like them better than Ni-Cad since they don't get that ""memory"" problem and not fully charge/discharge. But they don't hold a full charge for long. Just about every time I grab my digital camera which is not used frequently, the batteries are low or dead.For the last year or so, I have been using the ""Sanyo Eneloop"" rechargable batteries. They are far superior and I like them alot. They are still a Ni-Mh battery, but hold most of their charge even if left un-used for a year.Check them out. Amazon has a large assortment to choose from. I think you'll like them too."
2,Average batteries,"I bought these batteries a while ago as a replacement for some old no-name rechargeable batteries. I was highly dissapointed. Whereas my generic rechargeable batteries used to last a long time, these do not. The Rayovac batteries have to be constantly recharged even when used in remote controls or clocks. Cameras dry up these batteries extremely fast. I basically have to recharge the batteries every time I want to use the camera. The batteries don't seem to charge completely. I seem to be recharging the batteries on my clock about once a month and the ones in the remote controls about once every 3 months.I don't reccomend these batteries as they efficient nor practical as you will be recharging them over and over. Thus, you will be spending more energy than you normally would."
5,Great game,"This is a great game, one of my favorites. It is very different than all those FPS games. It is a very realistic version of war game... deserves 5 out of 5."
4,i like it and enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dude all of you haters i dont see wats the problem?""godd graphics bad gameplay blah blah blah!!"". game is pretty end i am enjoying it right now. it was very well made for the xbox. the first thing you will notice that developers have packed the large and complicated controls in the xbox green controler very well. plus i was also pleased with games TON of options to play. why cover fire? you can throw a smoke grenade run through machine gun fire and bam your safe(save that ammo). i may not be able to play the game all day which makes it for a longer expirience. I also enjoy not to realistic gamenviorment....why? Well i always hear people complain its to realistic..too hard....meh meh boo friggin hoo! LIke in ninja gaiden or far cry whicever. Anyway tactics do get repetetive but thats why i dont play all day. anyway i hope you enjoy this i raq themed war sim/arcade.I AM SO TIRED OF IRAQ THEME.....dont missunderstand me"
5,Stupid people,(...)I downloaded a bunch of videos for it off the internet and all I can say is WOW. Just the video of the squad sitting there while the controlling person just looked around was amazing. The level of detail is amazing. The wind blows and you can see little pieces of trash blow with the wind. The buildings and environments are just detailed beyond anything we've seen to this point. Easily as good as if not better detailed than Splinter Cell. Watch this one with a close eye.
1,Full Spectrum Warrior,"This may possibly be the worst game I have ever played in my life. The game is more like a horrible RPG than and action shooter. All you do is walk around, find the bad guys and tell your men to shoot, that's right you don't even get to aim, you just tell your entire team to fire. I don't think this game even deserves 1 star!(The reason I put 1 star was because they wouldn't let me put 0) I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game. Trust me, IT'S A HORRIBLE GAME, AND STAY AWAY FROM IT! I can understand that this was made to train the troops in the field but at least make it fun like america's army! If you like this game, YOU SHOULD BE SHOT!"
4,oriental rugs,"the information is broad, and the information excellent in terms of what to look for in rugs,hand made vs machine and the consumer base was detailed."
4,Light up my Bed,This product has been wonderful for both my wife and myself. We can read and the other can sleep
1,For Shame!!,"What enticed me to buy this book were the detailed illustrations. What made me return the book in disgust was the bear family dynamaic. The three bears are all male (even though the middle-sized bear has a soft floral chair and flowers painted on his bed which is covered with a floral comforter). At first reading, I thought I had misread the text when it says, ""the the middle bear spoke in HIS middle-sided voice"". But sadly, the family that lives ""happily in their little cottage"" has no mommy."
3,Good for th VX8300,Excellent fit on my wife's VX8300. I gave it three stars because it would not fit my VX8350. But for my wife it's 4 stars!
5,Great survey of current embedded systems topics,"This is a great book for learning about a wide range of up-to-date embedded software design topics. It covers subjects including UML, real-time operating systems, embedded networking, programming in C and C++, and IDEs -- a lot to cover in less than 400 pages.I found it at just the right depth for getting a quick but not superficial introduction to the diversity of embedded software technologies. This is not the book to read if you're looking for an in-depth treatment of any of the topics it covers; rather, it provides a broad, current survey of important areas in embedded software development.The book's chapters are mostly independent, having evolved in part from past magazine articles, so you can skim through looking for topics of interest and dive in wherever it strikes your interest. The author takes a concise, pragmatic approach, with many insights from his long experience in the field."
5,Carolina Herrera Lotion,"This is exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered it. I'm a big fan of this scent but have discovered it's discontinued (?). I wish I could find the body creme they use to make, but this is great for the lotion option."
4,Sweet Machine,The black guitar has a great retro appearance. Nice tuners but I personally think they could have downsized the headstock a bit. The light weight is surprising and the finishes are slick. The slim inlaid rosewood neck works fine for stubby little fingers like mine and the humbuckers sound amazing. Just plug in and terrorize the neighborhood.
2,not a fave,Should have listened to reviews! Too hot to handle and hate the clips (won't hold or leave a crease in your hair). Love the size and they were the only ones I could find that large. Hate to use them.
1,Too hot,"I just purchased these because of the size of curlers and convenient travel size. However, the curlers get way too hot to handle. It's really hard to roll up your hair without getting burned. Don't like them at all."
1,Cheaply made,This is a very cheaply made hairsetter set. It takes 15 minutes to heat up and that is per the instructions....wish that info had been available in the advertisement on Amazon. The curlers fall out of the base with the slightest wiggle; they are no on a post but just a little nub of metal which explains why they take forever to heat up. It will do until I can find a better made set. I do like the large 1.75 inch roller and they are hard to find. The seller was super but if you can find another jumbo curler set I'd go for it and not this piece of crap. Helen of Troy should be ashamed.
1,Very Disappointing,"The five curlers did not ""seat"" on the heat posts firmly and the cover did not latch down. So unless banded with an elastic band or something, the cover would come off and all the curlers would topple out. I returned it without using it when I saw how inconvenient it would be for travel. If you're not using it for travel, it might be satisfactorty."
4,Good but not great,I always wanted to watch this series from the begining - only problem is that it doesn'y start at the begining. I've only watched a couple of episodes maybe it will get better.
2,Good to bad,"This movie series started good, But quickly turn to a bad story line and then to bad acting.I wish I never purched it!"
3,V The Complete series,"1st, I thought I was getting the Complete Series from start to finish, but this is the weekly show I had only vauge memory of. It is interesting in the way that characters are pealed off from the original to less than than complete ending. Looks like the show may have been canceled."
5,GREAT DVD,"NICE ITEM, FASTS SHIPPING, I WILL BUY FROM HERE AGAIN, LETS GIVE THEM 10 STARS, INSTAED OF JUST 5,,,,,,THANKS SAMANTHA"
4,The Visitors,"This set of DVDs predates the current V series.I started watching ""V"" and decided to purchase the TV series on DVD that is/was the basis for the current show to refreh my memories of the older show...I'm very satisfied with the original series.Charlie3"
1,"a wasted chance,and a poorly made series",after two fantastic mini-series they brought this to a series format and lost everything that made the movies good.from the outset this show was tired and they plots were just silly. the use and reuse of stock footage also helped nail the coffin shut on this one. the same stock footage was use in the same shows. now stock footage is fine to use but to use the same piece three times in one show is really bad! skip this and get the mini-series instead!!!
3,V Complete Series,"Good story line, especially the ending. Good video definitionThe audio is poor quality. No audio on our Sony DVD recorder, on the panasonic dvd player the audio was garbled as with one of our computers. the other computer the sound was clear, but had to turn the volume withein 2 dots of max to hear it. The same is true of V Final Battle.It would seem the company that makes the V DVD could put out a good quality DVD which is compatible with all DVD recorders & Players"
3,Dukes of Hazard in Outerspace,"They blew it with this series.. Kenneth Johnson created a timeless masterpiece with the V miniseries. It could apply to any time period- past, present or future. It was a documentary on humanity -- this series lost all of that magic. I give the series 3 stars because it's just such an awesome concept that we were introduced to through the miniseries. I watched each episode wanting so much more than I was left with. But Jane is such a great evil alien I watched just to see her scenes."
1,This has to be the Worst Group ever,"These clowns had the audacity to name themselves after the biggest street anthem in history sung by Menace. I'm sure that Menace will/would be highly embarrassed by this farce. By far this group has the worst sound I have heard in ages! This is sound Not music,every track equals the same garbage. I hope these folks do not take themselves seriously, because they are laughing stock, simply put. Not only do they take every riff and tune from every other band out there since 1980, but they claim to be Original. And those terrible accents are boring, and their concept of sound is drowned out by these guys talking around their bum. So what's the future of this CD in my possession? One hundred pieces in one minute. I will burn the inserts as well so no one will have the misfortune of hearing this tragedy called last years youth again."
1,Lots of errors,"This may be an engaging story, but the author should have checked her facts. I gave up after 100 pages of misinformation - she made so many errors in that space that I didn't have the stomach to read any more. The lack of an Acknowledgements section seems to imply that the author did not get help from any experts on the religions she covered. That's a shame - it could have been a very enlightening book if she had checked her facts."
2,You'll pray for this book to end.,"I shudder every time I read someone comparing this ineptly written piece to the captivating ""Sophie's World"". Yes, the concept is similar, but that is the alpha and omega of this muddle about the world's religions. Clement's characters are completely inconsistent (sometimes you can't tell if supposedly 14-year-old Theo should be wearing a diaper or a condom), unbelievable and unlikeable. Her thumbnail sketches of Judaism and Catholicism are filled with errors, so it made me distrust any of her takes on other faiths as well. Her finale of bringing all the different religions' mouthpieces together at the end is more like a community theatre curtain call than a believable ending. Two stars for her laudable goal with this book, and zero for her childish and condescending writing."
4,Filled with personal experiences,"I found this book to be very unique among the many books about naval aspects of the Civil War. Gosnell openly focuses on the personal accounts of officers and sailors in the Union and Confederate river forces as well as several newspaper columnists that witnessed incidents. After giving the reader a sound overview of the weapons and ships used in the western rivers, Gosnell allows the personal accounts of those that were there to walk the reader through the river war. Gosnell's comments contexualize the personal accounts but do not overshadow them. It's a very effective way of engaging the reader. The negative aspect of the book is that Gosnell overlooks some events, although he openly acknowledges it when he does so. This book would serve as a fine companion for a more chronologically thorough, less-personal CW naval book."
3,Good enough but lacks details,"I expected more - something like a step-by-step guide to navigate Canada's bureaucracies with the end goal of creating and running a business entity. Instead, I got a regurgitation of the CIA World Factbook (apparently), tons of links with no summaries and context, motivational pep talk, various ""surveys"", and some general platitudes. I wish this book had stuck to its title."
4,This book helped me understand my role in the college.,"This was a pretty good book. Unlike other feedback, I did enjoy reading it. I was in an interesting position at the time at a college that was run as a business. This book helped me understand my role in the college. I realized that I wasn't a good fit for my previous position because I didn't have much say in the global picture, and I wanted to. I had to move on. I've taken the tools I've learned in this book and applied them to my current position. I now have a say in the global picture, and I am very happy about my move."
4,Business Simplified,"Ram Charan cuts right to the chase in this book. It's a short one, but it's packed with goodies. Charan explains the keys to making money and increasing wealth: 1) Business Acumen (the main components being cash generation, margin, velocity, return on assets, growth, and focus on the customer) and 2) Getting things done (which includes selecting the right people, increasing their capacity, and linking their efforts to a core set of business goals - developed using business acumen). Sounds simple, right? Frankly, it is. It's a no-nonsense explanation of what all managers, and all employees ought to know about business to enable them to gauge the performance of their company/organization/group, and put practical achievable plans in place to improve it.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper"
3,Ok book but a little too wordy,"Yes, it's a small book already but I thought the author could have got to the points sooner with a little less prose and more advise. I can see that he did a lot of work and is obviously an intelligent person it just as another reviewer put it ""the book does not deliver on what the title suggests"".It's worth a read on a long airplane ride but not worth setting your career by."
3,A quick summary of business fundamentals but incomplete,"The book can serve a quick summary of basics of business. However, to really understand a business from inside one also has to undertand core processes such as1. How is supply chain managed2. How is Information technology Leveraged3. What is the ""core"" strength of the business - economies of scale/eco. of scope/unique products etc.Venkat"
5,We love Tings!!! Great taste without dairy or gluten!,This product is a great choice for those restricting dairy or gluten. It has the same texture as a cheeto and tastes quite good. Perfect snack for kids and no cheesy orange mess.
2,Only bought this for Lucy Pinder,"I only bought this film for Lucy Pinder's cameo, and man is it brief. It's a toal of 2 1/2 scenes, but its her film acting debut and so I got it to add to my Pinder collection. ""Strippers vs. Werewolves"" is actually worse than I expected and that means a lot considering the subject material. Not enough gore/sex appeal for a movie of it's title and its tries a bit too hard with some of the jokes. It has it's moments but ultimately once Lucy was no longer in the movie I lost interest."
3,Fun,"Nothing new here, just great looking women fighting the dumbest looking werewolves. Watch it for eye candy if you like bad movies."
2,his best and only hit,sorry hate camron and all dipset this song is alright though now if only jules sdantana can get a hit.
2,Really? It's not so simple..,"I have this book, I like the models, and they are presented well,even showing how to use them, and I am a folder! BUT... the instructions are not simple. A folder who has folded a moderate amount can figure out the instructions and complete the models without too much stress. But a beginner adult or child will have trouble!An adult who has never folded trying to fold with a child might have trouble and it is certainly not the book for children to pickup to use first time. You'll be frustrated and not fold!So get some experience, be prepared to think it through, you'll need patience, but the models are good."
5,Great shoes for learning to walk.,"I got these for my seven month old because he is starting to walk around while holding on. He really likes them. They help with his balance and protect his feet. They are really easy to put on, which can be an issue with baby shoes. They do get dirty since they are white, but they still look nice. I had the same pair in a bigger size for my first baby, but in a bigger size, since he didn't walk so early. They worked great with him too."
5,detailed and thorough,"Conference planners will find this book to be indispensable in the planning process. Although more appropriate for medium- to large-sized conferences, even small conferences can benefit from the wealth of information that covers every aspect of organizing a conference. Chapters on speakers, promotion, administration, exhibitions and even the art of chairing a conference are some of the topics covered.A side note: the book was written in the UK, but measurements are provided both in metric and feet. The principles apply no matter the location."
5,Very high quality,"This is a very well made and designed unit, very durable, and a big step above the usual fanny pack. It also has a nice long and wide web belt, which is a comfort for us larger adults. I got it for a family member who likes to carry his camera, a water bottle, reading glasses, cell phone, and medications when we are out and about at area attractions where you do a lot of walking. I like this so much, I am going to order one for myself. Much handier that dragging a purse everywhere."
4,Good multi-use pack,"We have used this pack for short (few hour) hikes and it works OK. After purchasing it, I think that I would like a backpack/hydration pack combo instead. However, it does really well. We keep a camera, protein bars, gps, first aid items and other goodies for our hikes. It looks stylish and you do hardly notice it when it is on."
4,great pack,"i was worried that my 2 litre camel bag won't fit into the pack, delightfully, it did with a little strategy positioning.love this pack, it's perfect for going for long walks with my dog (with his towel, snacks and water packed in).improvements i would like:1. some compartments for cards in the middle section2. the strap is too long, and the contraptions to keep them from dangling everywhere did not really workoverall, i love this pack"
3,One of the most Beautiful Red Shoe Diaries you will find!,"The first story is an Olympic Swimmer and a lifeguard, beautiful underwater photography and a lot of it. Most of the half hour was underwater, total body nudity. The second story involved a lot of skydiving. I hadn't seen the man with the large tatoo in the first story but he is in the second. I imagine making love on parachute silks would be fairly erotic. The last story is called ""Tears"". Russian ballet dancers and some beautiful music. ..."
5,ldeal general reference book,"I highly recommend this book. The diagrams are clear and well organized, the accompanying directions easy to follow. A word of warning, however: pressure on trigger points can be *very* painful, particularly if the pain being treated is severe. Be prepared. (It's worth it.)"
4,Very Helpful,My son is a musician and has lots of stress and aches from practicing long hours and this book helped him find some of the worst trigger points and allow him to practice longer and more comfortably.
1,Are these guys kidding?,"I too have read a great many books on the art of the sale, but this one is the clear winner for the presentation of recycled nonsense. There isn't a single idea in this book that hasn't been presented before by writers both more talented and more credible than Cody and Hart. Save your money -- if you're looking for a quick fix to help your sales force through a tough economy, this is most definitely NOT it. The authors should address my pain and refund the purchase price."
3,A bit difficult to read,This book is a bit difficult to read but is a good way to get an understanding of this important battleSome of the complexities of the scene are well laid out and it's helpful to visualize troop movements.
1,Drawn out and hard to follow,"This book was very dry and drawn out and I couln't wait to be finished. It was often hard to follow as the author added almost too much detail regarding units and commanders. It was hard to keep track of who was who and often found myself looking back to remember who someone was. Maps often did not correspond with what section it was placed in and were often confusing. Also many editing errors. For example, spelling a name differently at the end of a paragraph than at the beginning. The Book is subtitled ""The Battle That Changed the Civil War,"" but only goes into this in the last two pages! If only Stephen Sears would write a battle history of Shiloh!"
4,OK historical account of this famous battle,"This was the first (and so far only) book I had read on this famous battle and I must say that at times I found the book to be confusing. Overall the book provided a good account of the battle and it was an enjoyable read. The author provides 15 detailed and easy to understand maps of the action and a number of photographs of the battle area and personalities. I must say however that the book did not get me involved as other books I have read on the Civil War. I did not get a feel for the soldiers or the Generals and the narrative on the fighting did not draw me into the text like Sears, Priest or Rhea. This was still a good book but not great!"
3,text-heavy and heavy,"I bought this as a gift, but looking through it before I wrapped I was not particularly impressed with the illustrations. I think I remember lots of text, too. Heavy compilation books like these are uncomfortable to hold while reading aloud."
5,Read stories before you read to children,"We really like this book. The pictures are beautiful and the stories are great, but may need to be modified to your children's needs. Some of the stories are a little too scary or incestuous.I read the story first and decide if my kids can handle it. I guess that's what you should do anyway right? This is a great way to expose kids to a different kind of entertainment other than mindless cartoons. Very ""Old School."" We love it!"
5,Great gift - ended up ordering one for ourselves!,"I bought this as a gift for our Goddaughter, but after looking through it decided I wanted one in our home even though we don't even have children yet.The book itself is a big classic looking, hard covered book, filled with beautiful detailed illustrations both in color and in gray scale on some pages. The stories come from all over the world and range from long fairy tales we all grew up with to short folk tales I had never heard of before. The writing is lovely and uses clear simple language that manages to not dumb things down for it's younger audience. I appreciated this and I loved the fact that the stories were left pretty much in tact with all the complications of the original stories and without a happy ending if there wasn't one.I enjoyed reading this and remembering my youth and I look forward to sharing it with our Goddaughter and eventually our own children someday."
5,Buy this book- you won't regret it!,"I was lucky enough to be given a first edition of this book as a child by my godmother. I took very good care of it but it was much loved, and by the time I was in college the binding was in sorry shape. It meant so much that I had it rebound in leather and still treasure it. When I discovered that the book had been reprinted I immediately bought another copy so I could share it with my sixth grade students. Even more than forty years after it's first printing my students are still enchanted by the detailed illustrations and this book, along with The Snow Queen, are often taken from the bookrack to read. The stories are enchanting, the illustrations are beyond compare and this book is ageless. You will not regret buying this book. Buy two and give one as a gift."
4,"Fast, easy and tasty recipes","Muffins and More is the only muffin book you will have to buy. The recipes are easy to follow, the ingredients are readily available at any store and the muffins taste excellent. I have tried quite a few and never been disapointed. Also included in the book are some equally excellent bread-cakes, scones and no-yeast baking breads. My favorites are the bran muffins, the banana cranberry loaf and the banana oatmeal muffins."
4,Hammer Does Noir,I'm a big fan of both Hammer Horror and Film Noir so I knew that I would enjoy these films. I watched them intermittantly with the Warner Bros Film Noir Vol 4 and they held their own against Hollywood's best. This collection of films answered my question as to where Terrence Fisher developed his expert craft.I would give it 5 Stars except that I don't trust 5 Star reviews.
1,Hammer Film Noir collection,"I would not recommend this set except for really die-hard fans. The best of them are only average and some are not even that good. For the content the price is too high. There is a collection called ""Classic British Thrillers"" which contains work by the director Michael Powell of Powell and Pressburger, which is much better for much less money. Or try They Live by Night and Side Street, two excellent films featuring Farley Granger and Kathy O'Donnell. Another little-known gem is They Made Me a Fugitive. Although a bit pricy it's actually very good."
3,Just ok.,"A good introduction to ""B"" films. These are late 1940's (actually from the 50s) dramas with some noir elements. The films look great--as if they haven't been seen in 50 years--which is probably the case, since they're not too exiting.I won't give a running commentary like some reviewers but I thought Heat Wave was pretty fair. The story is essentially the same as The Postman Always Rings Twice but its well done and not as slow as the other films. Hillary Brook, who went on to superstardom with Abbott & Costello, was quite a dish and gives a great performance.Dane Clark, a prominent figure in many Hammer/VCI movies is perfectly adequate but like the movies themselves, a bit lightweight. Robert Mitchum he ain't.All in all, good transfers and a lot of content for the money. Or course there is better noir available (even from VCI, for example Blond Ice) and I know of at least one Hammer non-horror film that's quite good, The Four Sided Triangle."
1,defective dvds,"iCarly: Season Two, Volume ThreeI have purchased all of the ICarly DVDs and this is the only dvd that has problems. I bought 4 of these. I purchased 2 online and 2 at a toy store trying to get one with no flaws. This particular title ONLY, skips freezes and doesn't play correctly on one of the discs. Come on....4 dvds of the same title! it has to be a manufacturing problem. I hope they correct it. We wanted the complete collection."
2,A waste of time,"Occasionally funny and clever, but I can think of a thousand better ways to spend time than watching this stuff."
1,How could this smell so bad ?,"This cologne has to have been on the shelf too long - I purchased it for my son for Christmas and when he sprayed some on his wrist the whole room was aghast at how bad it smelled. Then when family came over we asked their opinion. They all thought the same thing.Is there anything you can do with a product that is this bad?At $108.00 a bottle I am looking for options.Any suggestions other than better luck next time - there will be no ""next time""!Disappointed in Bowie!"
1,Don't buy from watchzone.,Don't buy from watchzone if you want to use it as a gift. The box is broken. It looks like a used or returned one.I'd rather pay couple bucks more to buy from a branded online store in the future.
4,Very Nice Watch,"Being a fan of Casio watches, especially the G-Shock line, I bought this watch for my Mom for Christmas. She likes it very much and says that she has recieved many compliments. She says it is very comfortable. The only drawback she said, which is something I also noticed when I checked it out when it arrived, is that the numbers are a little hard to read from certain angles. You almost have to have it perfectly tilted the right way to see the numbers clearly. A nice and bright light makes it a little easier.All in all a good watch and I would recoment it to anyone looking to buy a nice Baby-G for either your wife, daughter, girlfriend, etc. I bought my wife another model Baby-G and it is still going strong. You just can't beat the G-Shock line!"
2,Okay Unrealistic,This book was about 5 kids who had to go to the South Pole. They are on a reality TV show. They are simulating an expedition from the past. They are given a little bit of supplies. The part that sticks out the most in memory is when Robert is pinned in the crevasse. Andrew was the most entertaining to me because he wasn't very smart. He also thought he was responsible for the ponies. My opinion never changed in this book because it was boring and unrealistic. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure stories.
4,Teens in danger on reality TV,"Moderately entertaining teen fiction set in a future when reality TV is more dangerous than it is today. Sound familiar? A similar premise to Hunger Games, but these children might survive if they use their wits. Although some ""future"" events are impossible to believe, the story of the teens is entertaining and inventive. Not as well written as Hunger Games, but still enjoyable."
2,Constant maintenance,"I'm not sure if the reviewers that gave this product such a raving review have actually used this product, or have only had it for a month. I've had this product for 3 years, and we've had several moving parts replaced each year -- some twice. It worked well for the first few months, then seemed to go downhill after that. It now constantly gets stuck for long periods of time (hours) at the bottom of the steps (not on the step), climbs the wall and stays there for hours, and barely moves anymore. If you have larger, or odd-shaped debris/twigs in the pool, be prepared to unclog it occasionally.If you don't mind spending money every year repairing/replacing moving parts, and babysitting it from time to time, then consider this product. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere. If it didn't work well in the beginning, I'd give it only 1 star."
3,Junie b Jones,Awesome awesome..Awesome so funny Junie b Jones you are the best. So so so funny I mean really funny. Ha ha ha
4,Funny Book,The main character is Junie B. Jones and Jim. Junie really wanted to go to Jim's Birthday. And the birthday was after school in the afternoon. Junie B. got upset at school because she could not go to the party. Or else she would be the only one in room nine that did not go. By Avery
1,a real disappointment,"I really can't think of much good to say about this album. I was a big fan of Soundgarden, and really enjoyed most of Cornell's first solo outing 'Euphoria Morning'. Audioslave lost me a bit, sure I understand that it was pretty much just a bunch of guys rocking out, but there wasn't the great songwriting that I'd grown to love in Cornell's other work.The same can be said for 'Carry On' - musically it's very boring and at times really cheesy. And lyrically it's clunky and repetitive. Not to mention that for the first time I can recall from Cornell's recorded work we hear him singing really badly out of tune, on a number of tracks (including, but not limited to 'No Such Thing', 'Ghosts' and 'Killing Birds').Let's hope that this is just a case of Mr. Cornell ""finding his feet"" after the demise of Audioslave, and I look forward to one day hearing him bounce back with something great again..."
2,"Agree with the ""Disappointing"" Summaries","My biggest issue isn't ""weakness"" of the material versus his Audioslave or Soundgarden tunes. Based on Euphoria Morning, I expected something more subdued and reflective. I think Carry On has a few gems, Billie Jean NOT among them (and I deducted another star on principal for including it on the album).My problem is that Cornell's voice is completely shot on this recording. Too much touring with Audioslave or whatever, his voice is very noticeably ""off"" from previous recordings. To me, it's a matter of poor quality control for him or the producer to have agreed to release Carry On as-is with the poor quality of vocals. I think the fans deserve to hear this material with Chris's voice at 100%."
3,On goes beyond the mundane pop schlock that was Euphoria Morning,"Let's face it; Cornell's first solo album was garbage. Because of that, you instantly want to hate his second solo effort. Carry On goes beyond the mundane pop schlock that was Euphoria Morning. Cornell still comes off as glossed-over rock, but flexes his vocal pipes hard enough to remind you of his metal roots. Though he never reaches the energetic heights of his Soundgarden and Audioslave days, Cornell still manages to wallop you with some powerful music. ""Billy Jean"" is by far the worst cover song EVER!"
4,"Good album, but he can do better","I've been a Cornell fan since his Soundgarden days, loved Euphoria Morning, and liked his stint with Audioslave although the first album is the only really good one.It seems like he's really trying to explore new sounds on this CD, much like he did with Euphoria Morning although this is much more of a rock album than that was. There are a few really good songs on this album, but the other filler tracks took a few listens for me to get into them.As with many Cornell projects this one may take a few listens, although the single ""No Such Thing"" is pure catchy rock. All in all I'm happy with this album and would like to see him keep going solo for awhile to see what he comes up with next."
2,It Sort Of Sounds Like Chris Cornell But....,"What the ....! Okay, I know I was waiting for something good too. I mean I've been a loyal fan of Chris Cornell for years. But I can't stand behind this album. Its just not the level of work that I have come to expect from such a talented singer, songwriter. I'm sorry, but I did try find something to like about this album. I've listened to it several times. I just can't find anything to that deserves any praise. I'm still trying to hold on. But this one actually hurt. I just hope his next album is better."
1,"Nice looks, poor quality","I know this is an inexpensive radio but I still expected more than delivered.Cons:1. Display screen was badly stained/clouded underneath the protective plastic.2. Tuning on the AM band was off by 5-6 Khz.3. Large gaps in housing seams (two pcs of the body didn't fit together well at all).4. Reception of both AM and FM bands was quite poor.5. Takes 2-AAA batteries, not 2-AA like the description states.6. I returned mine for the above reasons, mostly 1 and 2.Pros:1. Very cool looking radio, the design sold it.Summary:Not recommended as it appears this radio is a good example of ""you get what you pay for"" and I expected more."
3,Starter FreeBSD Book,This book can only be of use to those new to FreeBSD. I found that a lot of topics were too general and did not provide any in-depth information for more experienced users.If you're just starting out with FreeBSD then this is great book for you. If you are looking to further your knowledge then look for a book aimed at a higher experience level.
4,Tim's review,"This is a great book. It was filled with interesting facts and had a good storyline. It also was very good at explaining what could be confusing.In the story the twins, Grace and Marty, are in a boarding school when they find out that there parents died on a trip in a helicopter crash. They then go to live with their Uncle Travis Wolfe, founder of eWolf a large electronic company, and a cryptid hunter. When something goes terribly wrong, the twins end up in the middle of the jungle.I think this book will interest readers of all ages that like criptozoology because it has lots of facts."
3,"Good start, but weak finish","Cryptid Hunters had a promising start with the twins, their mysterious uncle and adventure in the Congo. However, despite their parents' mysterious disappearance, the twins showed no anxiety or little curiosity as to their whereabouts or whether they were still alive. By the end of the book, the parents had been forgotten by everyone but this reader.I thought Smith could have tied up loose ends and had an outstanding book, but as it is, I was disappointed by the weak finish."
2,'Glum cinnamon',"Derieva's Sum Total of Violations was a revelation. These versions by divers hands are, shall we say, variable. Some (Andrey Gritman p11) are worse than others (Andrey Gritman p12) but as a whole they lack conviction, while some are barely English - most of the 20-poem sequence Winter Lectures for Terrorists, for instance, with the notable exceptions of Methods of Relations (bar that dodgy title), More Recommendations of a General Order (title ditto) and Study of Foreign Languages. Diplomat Kevin Carey, who did these, is also responsible for the other undoubted successes of the collection, It was not Necessary to Study and But if there is a Bomb?, and the only slightly less good I Have Rolled Myself Up. One's left frustrated by the lack of a firmer editorial hand"
4,Quality power supply,"Heavy shielding and very quiet fan. If you've never changed a power supply before make sure you put matching pieces of tape with numbers or letters on them to help you re-install new p.s. You'll probably have 3 to 5 unused connectors that need to be wire tied and tucked away from any fans. This product is definetly an upgrade over power supply that came with my HP pc. 450 watt versus 300 watt, quieter fan, better shielding.Definetly worth the extra money over the cheaper ones being offered."
1,Don't buy this game,"This game is poor at best. The graphics are miserable compared to MVP 2004, so bad that the baseball cards you're supposed to collect are nearly unreadable, even when you zoom in to view them.Navigation between modes/screens is long and tedious.The gameplay is also unenjoyable. Fielding is slow, and hitting is more complex than it needs to be.I've now tried MVP, and ASB this season, and I'm now waiting for ESPN MLB, maybe it won't be the disappointment ASB 2005 has been"
4,Excellente !!,It was very fun to play. I have just about every sports game out there and this one rates right up there with the best of them.
1,What was I expecting from Acclaim?,"From Streets of LA, where a Dragon pops out in the middle of a game, to Tony Hawks skateboarding every game Acclaim makes is a miserable failure. This was no different. The crowd is not only 2-D, but it is so blurry you can barley make it out. The ball move faster than the speed of light, and the runners run at a 100 miles an hour, making this game unrealistic. The ""feildercam"" really ruins the game, because when you are trying to pick up a ball it randomly changes views making you veer off in the wrong direction. If you just hit ""X"" to pitch, you can drop your controler, and the computer will do the rest of the fielding for you, as a matter of fact, this is the only way to play without getting a patched version sent out, and they charge for shipping (Acclaim, not Amazon). This game gets a -3/10 (Thats right, negative 3) on my scale, which is the lowest rating I have ever given to a baseball game."
2,LCD doesn't work on Australian/European models!! Avoid!!!,"Works fine, but the LCD info display (temperature, clock etc) does not light up completely, with an Australian/European car.AVOID THIS DEVICE IF YOU LIVE IN AUSTRALIA OR EUROPE, THE LCD DISPLAY WILL NOT WORK!Amazon happily refunded me and offered free return postage - love amazon's service!!"
3,concerned,i am writing to you because my item was sent back and i only got one attempt to my house and i wanted to see if you can resend me the item???
1,If your looking for Animal Farm in America this is not it.,"This is the wrong one if your looking for a DVD of the special that was released in America. That release, the Hallmark full length Animal Farm is also on this site. This is a 1 hour english short and not even in the same league."
5,A great album to check out!,This album from the bosstones is great! It's better than great! I'm not even sure what to call it! The ska has been flavored with hard-edge punk that is hard to not enjoy.
1,This is a piece of crap,"I bought it for a gift. It's really really tiny, and it brokes the first time my mom wear it!. Beware, the money don't worth it!!"
4,Nice mix of tunes for multiple listenings,"I bought this after seeing the movie. I don't know much about reggae and after I did some research on it, and read a lot of reviews, I thought this would be a great introduction. I have not grown tired of listening to it! Most of the tunes are really great, they are classics, and I like all of the tunes. I only skip over a couple after I've been through the CD at least once (in one sitting) and want to hear some particular ones again. I do not hesitate to recommend this as an album. Only complaint is that Satta Massagana is too short!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"The writing was lyrical and lush with lots of colorful descriptions of flowers but the story lacked dramatic conflict and it was hard to empathize with the characters. So, I kept waiting for the plot to move forward and it didn't. It remained as stagnant as the primary character."
4,A comprehensive Piano Rebuilding Book,"I've got the book 3 weeks ago. From a first glance, it looks like a very comprehensive and thorough book on every aspect of rebuilding and servicing a piano. I'm going to use this book in order to select my next piano, and I aim to purchase an old fine-quality piano and rebuild it as necessary.I found it a bit problematic to try and explain verbally the mechanism of the piano. The included photos help a lot, but they are not so bright and clear. I would recommend next version to iclude better pictures and maybe also a CD with video to explain better than words the mechanical parts and function of every part.Having said that, it is still an excellent book, a must have, and after reading a couple of chapters, one gets the understanding of how the piano works, what are the criticla parts, and what to look for when searching for a new piano."
4,"Good resource, pictures could be updated a bit","Other than less than stellar illustrations, the book delivers exactly what is promised, that is, a definitive guide to all things piano. I don't think it makes you an expert or ready to tackle a full refinish, however, it will make you more savvy on all aspects of piano restoration and what to look for."
3,Cute chest to play with or bury,"I bought this pirate's chest to fill with ""treasure"" and bury at the beach for my kids to dig up.I distressed it a little with a hammer, and it held up to gettting ding marks. Still looked good. No stain came off or exposed raw wood. one of the slats on the top loosened and came off, though, and I could see the construction was not too sturdy, but it was easy to glue back in place. The stuff that comes inside is so-so. Not authentic looking if you are trying to pass it off as a real treasure chest, but plenty of fun for a young child who just wants to play with it. The flag, eye patch and coins are a little cheesy. There is a large Melissa & Doug sticker on the bottom of the chest, FYI. The latch is cool-looking, with faux jewels on a skull in the eye sockets. Really cute toy for the young and pirate obsessed, and passable as a real treasure chest if you sub out the contents."
2,What you see is what you get.,"The picture is literally all that is included in this set. The price is very high for a few items. The ""secret"" space is not difficult to find. My son played with this for all of fifteen minutes. It is real wood, so it will last. It may be higher rated by a younger child's parent."
5,Wonderful Chest,"My 3 1/2yo loves this pirate chest. It is just the right size for little hands, has a secret compartment that he loves and is very well made. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised at what good quality this is from the wood to the latch. He'll definitely get many years of good use with this. I'm very pleased."
2,Extremely Outdated,"This book was extremely outdated. I received the 3rd edition. It has chapters on ""Grandma navigates the internet"" which introduces you to the NEW concept of email, ""The telephone connection"" which talks about the high cost of long distance calls (all free now), ""The audio tape connection"" which advises you to buy a cassette tape recorder, and getting out your ""sewing box"" to make items.The author writes about growing up with milk delivery by horse drawn wagon, and telegrams being the fastest method of communication. I wish I had investigated the book more before I purchased it. It's a dinosaur. The 4th edition can't be much better."
1,pretty weak,This dvd contains 5-10 minutes of new footage but is mostly recycled old Sesame Street clips (without Elmo in them). My 2 year old Elmo-obsessed daughter was not interested at all and asked to watch another movie instead.
3,Jamaican Calypso?,"If you thought Calypso and steel pan were from Trinidad then you are quite right. So it is a bit surprising to see just how much Jamaican Calypso there was in the 50s and 60s. The Calypso origins of Reggae are still in contention between Trinis and Jamaicans because of this very ""Jamaican Calypso"" issue. Well here is a healthy 3 disc portion of Jamaican Calypsos with the odd Trinidadian dignitary (Lord Kitchener, Mighty Sparrow, Lord Invader etc) thrown in here and there for added flavor. This collection is interesting and worth buying just for historicity. But for authenticity sake Trojan should have taken the trouble to point out that these are mostly Jamaicans, not Trinidadians. There are important differences in sound to account for here (some of these songs are barely Calypso at all, sounding more like Rocksteady or even Ska). If I were buying a Reggae CD, I would likewise appreciate a warning that the band was from Baltimore."
1,sofa island review,"purchased this item over 30 days ago expecting summer to start blew up island on saturday 70degrees wow. found it had a leak. obviously manufactures defect, also discovered if you pull the plugs out, it will lose all its air very unsafe strongly urge Amazon to pull these blow up islands from there shelves and to return them to the manfacturer thank you"
2,OK Cheap. OK for wired. But the worst in Wireless.,"As a regular router, this is classic, beautiful, clean, and running well. BUt, once you start to be ""wireless,"" that is, using the wireless rather than the wired connectivity, this router is very annoying. You lose connection for no reason. And you, all of a sudden, get it back. And, worse than all, you never understand WHY and HOW you lost (or gained back) the connectivity.Love wired (like me) then go for it. Love wireless? Forget about it."
2,Worked for a bit,I bought this item back in March and it worked great. The wireless was working well except for the occasional loss of signal. Now however the wireless does not work at all. It is now only a wired router. In the long run I would go with another router.
4,"KISS: Could have been a lot better, but it still rocks!","The box set rocks! I think they should have rid the regular studio tracks and added obscure mixes and demos of the tunes. How many times do we Kiss fans have Beth and Rock and Roll all Nite on cd's?? One too many! Should have been an all unreleased project. But it's still a great set don't get me wrong.... I would have liked to hear demos of the not so popular tunes like ""Strange Ways"" and possibly ""Plaster Caster."" They could have also beefed up the booklet a bit too. The guitar case version is pretty nice."
3,Too scary for little ones...,"It's called ""kids movies"" but most were too scary for my six year old girl who usually loves Grimm's fairy tales. The packaging also isn't so great. It's kind of hard to figure out which movie you're putting each time because it's written so small. They could have made ten discs for ten movies instead of putting two movies on each disc (from both sides of the disc) which means you have to be extra careful not to scratch either side of the disc. For kids it's a little scary and for teenagers I guess it would be a little too boring and childish. Perhaps this is meant for grown ups who still love fairy tales or kids 10-12 years old."
4,Very informative. I like the plant distribution maps.,I have not done much more than browse this book. What I have read is very informative. The language used in the book is relatively technical with respects to the active compounds in the plants and their mechanism of action. The descriptions of the plants are detailed and help to make up for the lack of color photographs.
3,Do you really need one so long?,"I may have misread the description, but beware: 60 inches that telescopes doesn't mean that it telescopes TO 60 inches. It arrives that long and can be made even longer. Maybe useful for a bus, hardly for an ordinary passenger car."
5,The beginner ones are actually gentle enough for me!,"I have fibromyalgia, and was encouraged by my doctor to look into Qi Gong, as a low impact work out to gently, gradually work myself into shape. I can actually do these! When I'm able to get the toddlers to stay back so I'm not tripping on them, I can get through the whole session of the beginners' movements. Only problem is finding a time when the tots are out of the way."
5,Qi gong for beginners,Easy to follow instructions for each pose. You can then do the continuois workout. Great video that helps you build strength
5,ottimo,Semplici esercizi che danno un effettivo stato di benessere. Ho trovato fantastico un semplice twist del corpo che mi ha disteso el lombari e tolto il dolorino che da giorni avevo. Fantastico
4,A wonderful way to learn beginning Qi Gong,"There are many forms of the eight pieces. This is somewhat different from what I'm used to but it's a very healthy, isometric form that I like very much. Pei explains each exercise. His voice is soothing and helpful. There are bonus routines as well. What I didn't like was that he didn't put together a complete flow to follow. He demonstrates the beginning exercises plus more advanced. But he never puts them together in a flow you can follow.But if you want a video to simply learn the exercises and gain the benefits from each one, this is perfect.Highly recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
5,Sturdy,"I have used these many times over the years and they are durable and large enough to handle lots of documents, receipts, etc. This size is not always easy to find in the local retail market. Very sturdy, shipped promptly, would buy from vendor again."
5,Great Casio watch,I have owned Casio G-Shock watches for as long as I can remember. I love them becasue they are water proof and shock resistent. This is the first one I have owned with a metal band instead of the plastic band. This really dresses it up nice and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. It also has a solar battery so no need to change batteries and is atomic so it keeps PERFECT time. I have never had the solar battery fail and in the winter I usually have long sleeve shirts or coats on and it still seems to keep the battery charged. I would definitely recommend this watch and if or when it goes out will look for the same model again.
5,I need the guidance for practice,"I'm a biginner magickian, and I'd like to know about thelemic magick.That is all about that I want to get this book.Love is the law,love under will"
2,whats up with this,ok first off im not the biggest kiss fan but i like them and ive bought plent cds over the years so since i only have thrashs and unpluged &part of double platnum now i thought i fill it ou with the set i did kow ahead of ttime there were demos but come on a demo of strutter fine weres the hit god of thunder same goes as many others plus the audio is from hell not only the demos but half of the album tracks that were originaly decent recordings save yur money plus weres u make rock hard
3,Great Music,"This was a gift for my grandson, he really enjoys the music. Would have given it a five star except for the fact that the 120 page booklet came apart. Everytime he opens the booklet, pages fall out. If we could get a new booklet, I would change the rating to five stars."
2,blah noise,"Maybe I should have paid closer attention to other reviews before gambling on this disk. I had never heard of Deerhunter before and the song preview function wasn't working well, I only got to hear a piece of one song before I purchased this.Anyway, I think one reviewer compared them to the 80's static-E wall noise of Sonic Youth, another band I could never get into no matter how hard I tried. I just really don't care for this album. Maybe you will but I put it in and tried to dig it and it just took me for a ride with no hooks and lots of noisy repetition. I don't dig it. Maybe they have better albums but this one blows in my opinion."
3,Product variations,There seems to be a large variation in how large a lip is left at the top of the bags - from an inch to an 1/8th of an inch. The latter can make it difficult to open and fill the bags.
5,Best clubs yet!!!,"These clubs are working out great for me. I ordered three of the gold clubs, which are very nice looking and feel great. They are also a lot of fun, and very durable. I highly recommend these To experienced jugglers, and beginners. Just make sure you order the number of cubs you want, because they are sold individually, just so you know. I've now been using them for a few months and they're great! If you're looking for juggling clubs buy these, but first you should start with balls. Have fun!!!!"
4,hands on dino,It's a fun toy more than an educational toy but listening to a small child say big dinosaur names is pretty impressive. We enjoy hand puppets and the creative stories you can makeup.
3,Would be good if it were not so bloody hard!,"As usual, Turrican 3 delivers on action and button bashing with inventive, imaginative level design and furious gameplay. There comes a point though, in level 2, where the game becomes impossible and you (or at least me) go any further unless you have the timing of the Gods or something.Which is a shame, since the Turrican series is what run-and-gun platformers are all about. The music is once again brilliant, with loads of cool tunes by Chris Huelsbeck and the graphics are great considering the hardware. The Amiga version does have slightly better graphics than the Sega version, but otherwise, they're identical. It's just too damn bad that it's too damn hard.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C-"
1,Poor (I mean NO) Customer Service- WARNING,"Don't buy this TV. This company has NO customer service. I got my TV at the end of February, and it was working OK. The picture is quite pixalated and you have to remember that you get what u pay for.It is April 12 and we have been trying for 3 days to get a call back from the company with regards to shipping the tv or getting someone in to service it. The unit has gone ""wonky"" it is stuck in an endless loop cycle and will not react to the remote nor the on/off button. HUGE MISTAKE, and my goal is to make sure no one else makes this mistake. I always read negative posts on the web and never believed them, but now being a victim of this crappy company, I feel I MUST take a stand on the matter."
1,It's old stock...,The battery I received has a date code showing that it's been on the shelf over 10 years. That can't be good.
1,Machine never worked,"Right of box the ""tank full"" light was on and could not reset it by unplugging it or pulling out tank. Never got machine to work and returned it immediately!"
2,"You mean, you haven't interviewed U2?","This book was ok at best.... Yes, I agree that Stockman did a good job with the research. If you do choose to read, make a note and read the books he mentioned later! It seems that some of the points he makes are somewhat of a leap. If you want a compelling read about U2 where all sides to the group are well presented because of time spent with them, I would suggest reading U2: At the End of the World by Bill Flanagan. He is a wonderful writer and I can't quit flipping the pages!"
4,This book explores U2's faith,"""Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2"" does an excellent job of delving into U2's personal faith. It begins with the band's beginnings in Ireland and continues the journey on until ""How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb"". It offers enormous amounts of quotes, especially from Bono. Issues such as the AIDS epidemic and the violence in Ireland are given particular attention. I appreciate the ""shout-out"" to other artists in the book such as Charlie Peacock, Delirious? and Steve Taylor.The one thing I was disappointed in was how the Stockman throws out a lot of song titles and then explains what the song's about. However, I think it would have been better if the author had provided either the song's complete lyrics or at least quote the lines of the song that are being discussed."
4,Highly Recommended,"Briefly - If you are a U2 fan- a Big U2 fan that cares about the band and their beliefs more than than the ""average"" fan - READ THIS BOOK.What I found most enlightening about the book was Stockman's almost philosophical views about why the three Christian members of U2 (although I found the focus on Bono mostly)were drawn to their version of Christianty. His account is not personal though. You will not find there the persoanl motivations of the band members move twords Christianity, more of what was going on at the time. I almost expected to read more about how their upbringings or other emotional things could have contibuted- but I did not find that. Which is okay since the book was not meant to give biographical account of the band.This book is what the realm of U2 has been missing for a very long time."
5,Touch the Flame,"This book is a must-have for any Christian U2 fan. Stockmanexplores the many biblical references in U2's songs, and supportsthem with scripture. The book looks into the heart and soul of a band that is so often misunderstood. Bono's spirituality is examined in great detail, rightly so as he does write the band's lyrics and therefore guides their musical direction. This book gives new focus to U2's wonderful songs about faith, redemption and deliverance."
1,Not a good investment,"This book offers an extremely short listing of the different Aztec signs, and then proceeds to its purpose: to present the astrological readings of a long list of celebrities. Not a good book for someone who wants to learn about astrology."
1,Lost,"The orginal outlander was fun, This one is technial excellant and was as funny as a gw bushes budget. All of the funny jokes are missing. The Voice actors try but you can not do funny if there nothing to work with.They would have done better to have cleaned up the video and left the voices alone. Rent a copy of the vhs tape if you can find one"
1,poor quality and rude customer service,"Dont waste your money on swimline products... Maybe you'll luck out and get one that will stay inflated more than a day.. And, don't bother calling or e mailing their customer service dept for help. E-mails don't get a response and the rude person on the phone could care less about helping.. I've never written a poor review for any company or product - until today...No more swimline products for me. lesson learned."
3,Best Two-Day Float,"The lounge seems very well made and durable. Its five separate inflatables are sturdy and incased in a comfortable, stitched nylon. My wife loved it, however, it didn't last long. After one day of strictly lounging some of the stitches began to fray enough to see the white inner tubes beneath the fabric. After day two there was a large hole in the leg rest seam. This allowed the nylon cover to fill with water, adding more stress to the stitches. At this rate, the only thing that would be floating in a week would be the mojito in the cup holder. My wife hates to see the lounge chair go (on day three I mailed it back for a refund), but for that price we expected something to last a lot longer."
1,junk,"junk do not buy it totally junk i called and complained and no results .it is junk,junk,garbage only differance is garbage smells this float just sucks royally"
4,a good read,"I bought this book because I am (someday) going to do this hike. What a great adventure! Reading this book has made me put it a little higher on the ""to do"" list. Chris Townsend did a great job telling his story. It has not only been educational but a very enjoyable read that I highly recommend to any avid hiker."
5,Pentax Remot control F,I bought this for a Pentax K10D camera and it works just like it said it would in the add. good range from the front or back of the camera.Its nice to be able to take a picture without having to have a cord hooked to the camera I also have the wired remote witch you have to be right at the camera to use.the only thing about it is you have to take the remote apart to change the battery (no door). I would say if you have a pentax K10D or the K100D buy this remote you will not be sorry.Also if you have the K10D get the battery box that fits on the bottom of the camera it holds a spair battery -Extra sd card and the remote. Amazon has all of them at a good price.Pentax Remote Control F for Pentax Digital Cameras
4,exactly what it should be,"This little thing works great. I was afraid it might be more complicated or require batteries or something, but you just take it out of the box, set your camera to accept it, and click away. Using the 3 second delay gives you enough time to hide the clicker from view before the shutter goes off. The only problem is that you might loose it, because it is very small."
5,awesome remote,"what a novel idea to put the remote in your hand without any wires -- before this, i had to ask someone to take our picture and each time I worried they would run off with my $1,000 camera. Now we can set up the camera where we want and take our own pictures. I love it."
3,Remote review,"Although the remote does what it says I have 2 problems with it. First it does not focus first then shoot like the on camera button. It shoots when you press it so you have to focus manualy then you can shoot remotely which kind of defeats the purpose. Second is it's almost too small, it would be real easy to lose and they should have put some kind of eye for a chain or something. The other remote with an attached cord works normally so I actually use it more. A wireless remote that allows focus would be nice"
5,Outstanding!,"First of all, a disclaimer - I know Linda Sanford and have worked with her at IBM for over 20 years, and I confess that I am a huge fan, so perhaps not entirely objective! That said, this book is too good an opportunity to pass up. Being in IBM, Linda is perhaps not as well known as 'star' CEO's like Meg Whitman - but if you look at her track record, its AMAZING! She's the one who brought back the IBM mainframe business from a near-death experience, and over the past several years has been working quietly and diligently to move IBM to be one of the leading companies in not just TALKING about the value of technology, but implementing it and proving the value propositions. This book has a lot of her quiet wisdom in it - and is highly worth a read!"
3,"Some interesting ideas, but too repetitive","This book contains certainly some interesting ideas, provides nice examples of business that are transforming and offers some interesting facts (like the fact that employment in Chinese manufacturing is declining more rapidly than in the US!)However the book (luckily only 200 pages) keeps on repeating itself from the beginning to the end of the book. The authors keep on explaining and repeating the same ideas in almost every chapter. The same examples (UPS, IBM, GE, e-Bay, P&G;, Fedex, Amazon, Li & Fung) are used and reused in almost every chapter."
2,Small quantities,"The box contains 8 different colors plus a clear finish, and it is up to the user to mix two or more colors to obtain a match to the area being repaired. The colors come in individual snap-top plastic containers, with just a fraction of an ounce of color resin in each. This doesn't leave much room for error in trying to obtain a color match, and won't repair many chips.The box contains printing which promises to send more color for free, and the manufacturer will do so, but with a $6 shipping and handling fee.The product generally does what it says it will do, but the skimpy quantities of color resin are a serious drawback."
3,HEEEEEEEERRRE'S ED!,"If you loved Johnny you can't help but love Ed McMahon. In this quick and easy read he recounts some of the most memorable moments of the Tonight Show on camera and off. It's warmly entertaining and, like Ed himself, often loveably corny. Sadly, it doesn't really reveal much of the enigmatic star of the Tonight Show that we didn't already know: he was shy and a perfectionist. I found myself feeling that Ed made an effort to sugar coat Johnny's personality and their relationship but if he did its because he truly loved his friend and colleague and that's all I need to know. I want to believe in my heroes. Johnny and Ed escape this story unscathed. I miss them."
2,Where's the beef?,"You'd think after a 46-year friendship that Ed McMahon would offer some deeper insights into Johnny Carson. Sadly, he does not. This book is simply a re-hash of old ""Tonight Show"" sketches with a few anecdotes thrown in.If you want to get a better picture of Carson, go online and buy some of the ""Tonight Show"" retrospectives. They're far funnier and a lot cheaper than this book. I do not recommend anyone purchasing ""Here's Johnny""...it's largely a waste of time."
2,This Book Will Not Help You Know Johnny Any Better,"If you want to know the ""real"" Johnny, this book won't help. One would think that Ed would know many ""inside"" stories about Johnny, but this book is just a rehash of the skits that were on the TONIGHT SHOW. Nothing new. Nothing earth shattering.Rent some of the available videos. A better way to spend valuable time."
3,Light stories about a comic master!!,"I was a Johnny Carson fan from high school and well past college. I watched about 30-45 minutes several nights a week. So I have very fond memories of the whole atmosphere of the show that Ed McMahon talks about.This memoir is brief stories, mostly with chuckles. And very enjoyable ones. There is nothing earth shaking here, and no new bio information. But if you liked the show, this is a very enjoyable telling of stories. No real organization, just pleasant memories.As for the Kindle edition, please note that the font is VERY LARGE, with much spacing between sentences and paragraphs. But no typos or formatting errors."
4,Read the Instructions - then it's worth it!,"I've had this camera since November of 2000 - I've been throughly pleased. The zoom is amazing, and I still get clear shots when I use Kodak 400 film. One thing though, the camera has a dial with 5 settings. Don't make my mistake and blow off the directions! Big mistake! While some of the features on the dial are very cool, I didn't find much use for them. The camera is a bit heavy and slightly bulky (like other Pentax's) and it does run through batteries fairly quickly... but these things are minor; Overall I give it 4 stars, great pictures when you use the camera properly!"
2,Over priced for quality!!,"Picture quality not reliable, bulky and difficult to use. Indoor pictures looked great, outdoor pictures over exposed, blurry, and shadows in images. Poor color in outside photos even with different brands/speeds of film."
2,READ ITEM DESCRIPTION!!! Don't believe the picture,"Buyers BEWARE!! Hopefully you will read these reviews or pick up on the product description before you make the mistake of ordering this item - the sale is NOT for an entire set of cartridges as the picture would imply, but for a SINGLE CYAN INK CARTRIDGE.The item itself is fine - a genuine HP 02 ink cartridge - but you can buy the same thing for half the price almost anywhere else."
2,Lid does not secure,"The biggest problem is closing the lid. The sides of the box are actually shorter than CD cases. So there is about a 1/2 inch the CD cases stick up, which then suspend the lid up as well. This makes for a flimsy fit.The biggest issue with this is that if you only have CDs on one end of the case, the lid sits at a slant because the cases hold it up on one end but not the other.The only way this case would be useful is if you fill it with CDs."
4,Good storage for the price,"Hey look, it was less than $5. Snapped together easily. I have discs in paper sleeves and they fit perfect. About 100 in so far and the box is about 1/2 full. The lid does not fit perfect but it does the job. It works really well to archive my discs and is not ugly. If you want pretty then you will have to spend more $. I would reccomend these to archive discs, but I am not sure that it would hold up to day in day out use."
4,About what I expected - sufficient for my need,"A few of the tops had some minor surface defects, but I didn't order them for their beauty. They hold my CDs & DVDs adequately in paper envelopes and are much more convenient than 3-ring binder CD/DVD pages. Assembly was a snap (sorry for the pun)."
1,Smell Of Strong Chemicals,"The storage boxes assembled easily and they looked like they would work well, but the eight I bought had a strong, almost sour, chemical smell. I kept them in my storage space for two months, figuring that they would loose the offensive odor. That wasn't the case and I put them in the trash yesterday."
1,The lid is too large for the box. No response from seller when I inquired about returning due to the too large lids,"The lid of the storage box doesn't fit the box. The lid looks to be made for a box that is about 1/2 inch wider. Since the width of the box is only 5.2 inches, the extra 1/2 inch is relative large in comparison. And because of the width of the lid, the box doesn't really close. The lid just sits loosely on the top of it. The boxes are okay if you don't plan to place them where people can see them. I gave the box only 1 star because of the poor fit and also because the seller failed to response when I emailed them. I have waited almost 2 weeks and still no reply."
3,Nice product but...,"If you have a ton of computer cds (ie, cds that sit on your desk or in your office and don't go anywhere), then the promise of storing 100 plus cds in this box is probably right up your alley. BEWARE, however, the box does not come with cd file folders as you might expect. I was kind of cheezed about that."
4,Great stuff!,I bought a bottle of this for $2 at a Big Lots store just to try it out and it is wonderful. I have baby-fine totally straight hair that won't hold a curl. I went back the next day andd bought 15 more bottles of this for $2 a piece at Big Lots.Now I see it on here for $12.95!!?
1,Swimline Ultimate Super-Sized Floating Mattress,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! The size is great but, due to the fabric cover, it is very difficult to remove from the pool. As for the quality of this item, it is horrible. There are no instruction. I inflated the mattress and as soon as I carefully laid down on it, it began losing air. There was a tear at one of the seams. The patch it comes with is a joke. I repaired the tear with a pool liner repair kit($9.00). Then I tried it again, and another tear in a different seam. Have not been able to repair this one. I paid alot of money for a cheap piece of trash...Swimline Ultimate Super-Sized Floating Mattress"
4,A Very Interesting Parallel,"I received this book as a gift and it is something I treasure today. The author does a very nice job of depicting his growth alongside of the Beatles' music and arrival in America. I like the way Mr. Schaumberg shows how the Beatles became fixtures in his school, e.g., Beatle-themed sketches for school shows, parodies of their songs and the way many kids emulated their hair and clothing styles. It was a fun trip down Memory (Penny) Lane and Mr. Schaumberg is to be commended for bringing the reader into the world that was largely influenced by the Beatles.Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!"
2,"Decent, but doesn't measure up to 60's Mac","Listening to this CD is like watching Wizards Jordan rather than Bulls Jordan. The playing is smooth and competent and slickly recorded, but clearly doesn't have the energy that the 60's Fleetwood Mac recordings did. You do get flashes of Peter Green's former technique, but mostly he seems to have lost a step. And that is completely understandable, considering what he has been through since the Mac days. On many tracks, his voice is difficult to hear. They bust through some classic blues tunes, but I would go to the early Fleetwood Mac to get the better versions of these songs."
5,"Got it fast, works great!!!",I received my order very quickly. It wasn't more than a few days. I've always loved Trimspa. It's the only weightloss supplement that seems to work for me. It's the real thing at a really great price!
4,Love it,Love this products. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is because I don't like how u have to take so many a day.
2,No staying power,"This little ring looks pretty at first, but the three-tone wears out quickly to a uniform faded silver. Disappointing."
5,"Nina's Book has such innocence, enthusiasm and vitality.","It's sort of a cross between a journal and a sketchbook, with drawings by Haring and lots of space for a child's own drawings and thoughts. I gave it to my son a couple of years ago. To be honest, he didn't get off on it, so a couple of days ago I asked if he would be willing to pass it on to his 9 year old sister, and she's been working on it ever since. I'd ignore Amazon's age recommendations. It's good for the artistically inclined, especially girls, up to at least age 11 or 12."
4,2 for 1,"Disc 1: Burrell (g) Reggie Johnson (b) Carl Burnett (d) 3/23/77Disc 2: Burrell (g) John Heard (b) Roy McCurdy (d) Kenneth Nash(perc) 12/79.This 2-CD set contains 2 Concord Jazz LPs: TIN TIN DEO and MOON AND SAND. MOON has a little bit more going on on it, with the added percussion and Burrell switching to accoustic guitar on some tracks, and is the better CD. Burrell has always had a warm, swinging sound, rich in tone - all of which is on display on both these discs. Not absolutely essential, but this set will give repeated pleasure."
2,Not a great book to read,"First of all, I know it is not easy to write and get a book published. I'm an author of a book called ""Dollar Wise, Penny Foolish"" and I know that writing a book is very challenging.I happened to pick the book because of its name. The name was catchy and entertaining.However, the key thing for a book is to entertain the readers and keep them engrossed. This book miserably fails in it.IN spite of reading few chapters, I never got to understand what this book is trying to convey.There are better books around to read."
5,The Name Book,"This book came in very good condition. I was able to begin to enjoy reading it quickly because of the timely fashion that I received it. I was very happy that it came right on time. I was able to find several of my friends' names and also my children's names making it a GREAT purchase. I even found a friend's name as well as my own name which were both unusual names. They were spelled just the way we both spell our names. I'm so glad I purchased from Amazon.com. So far, they haven't let me down."
2,Size,"this is my first S&w watch, good color and band but for my surprise the size is too small a watch like this for me has to be at least 43mm and when I was buying this watch they don't tell you nothing about the size so I though the watch was more than 40mm but its not so bottom line good looking watch but too small, I did the measure and I found this watch is 38mm for a tactical watch that's not good."
2,Died after 4 months,"It started out great and I loved it. I use all of the extra features. The battery meter is garbage though.It stopped working after a few months. Now it either shows full power or zero power and shuts off. When it shuts off you lose all of the data- phone #s etc.Only other complaint is that it is FAT. It sticks up high above your wrist and gets hung up on everything- clothes, doors, seatbelts, you name it."
4,I enjoyed it!,"I don't usually enjoy stories of the wild west, but I liked this one. I enjoyed very much Emily's love with Swift Foot, and the one with John Cartier as well."
3,PS3,"The game is OK at best, but if you are a Phantasy Star freek you have to get it. Fun when you get to know the ins and outs of it."
5,very cool good watch,"my brother got ripped off when he bought a watch like this in downtown NY for 120, for only 85$$ this watch is a steal for n excellent watch. Get it"
3,Good watch,"I don't really have any complaints about this watch except the loop thing that slides over the tip of the band just plain sucks. It doesn't stay in place and I have to constantly readjust it. Otherwise it seems pretty rugged and stylish.*** As an update I am reducing this watch to 3 stars because of the annoying band issue alone. The loop that slides over the end of the band simply does not stay in place and works its way to toward the clasp, making the band start sticking out too easily."
1,Wow... expansion book with no expansion info...,"Went to the book store and looked this book over... wasn't sure whether I wanted to laugh or cry. If you have a choice and just purchased EQ, just go get the original (also horribly inaccurate) book and stick to the mainlands and get used to the game by playing up to 20th level or so, then try going over to Kunark (the expansion that the made the book for, but barely any info in book for it). You'll have better luck, or just go online and print out maps and get better info there...Man, this book stunk."
4,a good easter egg,"When i stumbled upon this album I figured it wouldn't be worth a thing. Man was I wrong. If you like modest mouse and out there music your going to love this one. It lends its self to modest mouses ""people who love bad news"" album. You know which one I am talking about. A definate buy!!"
3,Hmmmm...,"This was not as good as I thought it would be. The only song that really sticks out is ""Hotcha Girls""...the rest just haven't grown on me. Maybe they will, maybe they won't.I think what is missing here is the rest of Modest Mouse.I will look forward to what is next with the whole band."
3,Whole lotta just pretty good,"An even more modest approach with less bombastic, more grounded, but nearly as weird indie rock displaying a few lovable listens, couple of embarrassing enunciations, but mostly merely moderately mesmerizing music expertly navigating neither-here-nor-there trajectory."
4,cd player,"I like this cd player because it has a great anti-skip, I use the car kit in my VW Bus and it gets knocked around a lot but the music never skips! I like the look, it is different from the rest of the cd players."
1,IM RETURNING IT,"I GOT THIS CD PLAYER FOR CHRISTMAS AND I WAS HESITANT ABOUT OPENING BECASUE I THOUGHT IT WOULDnt BE GOOD FOR SOME REASON, WELL I WAS RIGHT! IT IS A GOOD CD PLAYER WHEN LISTENING TO SOFY MUSIC BUT WHEN LISTENING TO DRUMS AND LOUD MUSIC (WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I LISTEN TO) IT SOUNDS VERY BAD! AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
2,telescoping tower does not function well,"I got these markers for my 4 year old boy and 2.5 year old girl for Christmas. The markers are a great size and all the colors are fun for them, especially my daughter who loves all the shades of pink. I am very disappointed in the tower. It will not stay up. Every time one of them takes a marker out or puts one back in, the tower collapses. If you buy this just for the markers, you'll be happy. If you want it for the cool telescoping display, skip it. You and your kids will be frustrated."
2,THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES THAN THIS,"This maker tower has lots of markers, but the case doesn't quite do what it should. Sure it telescopes...if you can get it to stay there, and make sure you VERY carefully take that marker out so the tower doesn't come crashing down once you do get it up. The telescoping feature is frustrating...we just leave it down and lift the lid to get the marker. The markers themselves come in a nice variety of colors but they dry out quickly. For this price, there are better choices. Mr. Sketch markers might be a good brand to start with...the quality is superb."
3,Frustrating,"Great idea and lots of good colors, but it doesn't lock in place for long and it's hard to get locked in the first place. My five-year-old is constantly asking for help. Version 2.0 is needed!"
3,"Good, not great....",The taste of this snack is a little too sweet and bland. Regular Pirate's Booty is better tasting. This is good but I probably won't reorder it.
3,A Classic of Sibling Rivalry,"The Master of Ballantrae is a classic story of personal conflict. The story revolves around the conflict of two brothers, the older free spirit and the younger restrained. The conflict that arises between the two results from events early in the book, but Stevenson, heaps fuel on the fire throughout the bulk of the story, until it climaxes in the ultimate confrontation.We tend to think of Robert Louis Stevenson as an author of children's books, since most of us are first introduced to his work through Treasure Island and Kidnapped. While those books offer some hint of the levels his skill as an author can reach, The Master of Ballantrae offers the adult reader the full breadth of the author's abilities. P-)"
2,Too slow for too little payoff,"I thought that the story was interesting but the whole process of these two people coming to terms with their problems was too slow and the resolution, when it came, felt rushed. So too slow for a too fast payoff that didn't seem very satisfying. I mean when you have issues within a marriage of an injured child, and unplanned pregnancy, an unknown child, difficult in-laws, ect, the story was just too short with too many scenes wherein the main characters don't have a chance to speak due to interference from other people. Not very intersting."
2,disappointed,"disappointed that inquiry to company advertising their product was misleading.teacher requesting math facts up to and including ""20"". company representative stating ""yes, cards include ""fact family"" of the number 20"". that was not the case.we were looking for 2+18=20; 5+15=20; 10+10=20; etc. which was exactly what i stated.i could've purchased the same cards locally from numerous stores for $1 just about anywhere.eventually, i located what i needed from A Beka (teacher & homeschool suppplier)."
2,Not a good investment,"I bought these pans because I liked the weight and the size. I have used them three times each, and the coating is peeling off of the inside. I wouldn't recommend them, and I won't buy Oneida bakeware again."
2,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad Success Stories",This book was exactly as advertised. In very good to almost new condition. The stories were interesting and informative. I think the over all purchase was was very good. Enjoyed the book and was very pleased.
4,"Real Life Examples of Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Good for motivation. This book is a nice departure from the regular Rich Dad series in that it focuses on some actual people and their stories instead of just trying to sell theory. Many of the stories were realistic and mirrored what you would expect when getting into real estate, etc. These people were not making tens of thousands of dollars every month like the Real Estate gurus would lead you to believe but were making a few bucks and positioning themselves for long term growth. It is also nice to read the background of the different stories and see what motivated them to take the plunge."
3,good enough to read but not the best.,"this book is telling the same story as in the show on T.V.If you already watch ""Sister"" on Teen Titans show on CN,I suggest that you should buy something more excited.Anyway,this book is the best choice if you want to practice your reading skills."
4,A style of writing: during the 1800s and English.,"All of the authors from Bront's time had to right in much greater detail. They had no tv, so a style of writing was used to make up for that. If you read a novel by Dickens the same style is used. Take advantage from this! Paint a picture in your mind, and satisfaction will be obliged."
1,noches de encuentros;alhambra chill out,this cd wasn!t made by NACHO SOTONAYOR.instead-it was made by FRANSISKO SOTOMAYOR.Complitely different music.BE AWARE!i bought it and i am sorry for it.just click at the words an screen/LARGER PIKTURE/and you will see the difference.
5,A fast and great read...,"A very moving book. I knew Joel from a distance, all we would say is ""Hi"" to each other. Nothing more. Reading this book should be a school requirement. It does not get any better. What a fascinating man he was. He will be MISSED!"
3,"Classic Janice, unfortunately...","Not really sure why I like this series. Janice is so ridiculously rude that her behaviour can only be for the benefit of the camera. It's like a car accident in that I can't turn away! It's also an interesting look at people's reactions to such behaviour and how much they're willing to put up with for the sake of being on TV and/or hopefully launching their own career in the industry.I think the thing that disturbs me the most is how apparent it is that Janice's bust is silicone. She dresses to shock and she really shouldn't. They're so obviously fake (I'm not just being catty, take a look for yourself) that she should be covering them up rather than letting it all hang out. But whatever... it's her body. She paid a lot for it and obviously likes it so who am I to judge?Can't say that this is a great series, yet I don't hate it. It's kinda weird."
3,Interesting Movie,An Interesting movie that at least was entertaining. More of a story that should be watched and hopefully interesting. Possibly do not need to watch more then the once.
3,Music is boring!!!,"A lot of explaining before each work out, I think with one introduction would have been sufficient. The music is not motivating at all. I had to mute and play my own music...but it is a great work out if you play your own music."
5,Awesome,This book was awesome.Was difficult to put it down.Very Hot!!!Can't wait for her next book to hit the stands.I am so there!!
2,"Big let down overall, a couple classic moments","I'm a big fan of Sunny, but was pretty disappointed in this 'episode' that cost $20.The writing/improv was off and rushed.The show was all over the place and lacked any and all discipline from the director.There are a few funny scenes, especially with Mac and Charlie, but all in all it drags on, and everyone seemed off their acting game - especially Dee and Dennis.The production quality is not consistent either with regard to lighting and cameras.Selling it on Craigslist.Big let down after arguably the best season yet."
1,Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"More and more items at Amazon are coming damaged, this was shipped top me for my son to take back to college and it came smashed, no we have to file claims etc make a whole bumch more work just to ship it again to him at college.I rate this item horrible"
1,I couldn't watch it on PS3!,"I can't watch it. I couldn't even get passed the first couple of minutes because it kept reloading. Amazon prime sucks, sticking to Netflix!!!"
5,Love the gang!,"I was already a huge ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" fan when I bought this. So, naturally, I loved it! It did seem a little darker than the show and because they weren't restricted by T.V. guidelines, there was a lot more cursing and use of the ""F"" word. I don't really care about that and I assume if you're a fan of the show, you really wouldn't mind either. I mean, let's face it, if you're a fan of the show, you're a little twisted anyway! ;) Just remember this isn't your Grandma's Christmas program!"
2,Not worth $30,"I'll be quick: I love love love the show and was pumped about watching this. Maybe I was expecting too much but it didn't seem as funny as a normal episode. Plus, the episode lasted maybe 45 minutes? I expected an hour to an hour an a half of greatness and all I got was a crappy episode. I was so disappointed I didn't bother to watch any of the ""extra's"". I'll stick with the tv show I get with my cable package."
1,Serious Let Down,"As a big fan of the show, I pre-ordered this expecting a higher quality version than the DVD. Turns out, it's too new for my bluray player which now requires an impossible to install update. I'm not sure why it needs the latest bluray standard, since according to the other reviews the picture quality is the same as the DVD. I should have picked up the DVD, or actually, nothing at all. I'd like to support the creators, but I wouldn't have purchased this if I had known it was such a terrible product. Sorry guys, I won't be buying anything else distributed by Fox or any bluray discs."
3,Tried and ... true?,"My wife and I used this guide to plan several onsen trips during my ten years in Japan. It is well written and fairly accurate but at times somewhat misleading. Some of the springs have closed their doors since the book was first published while others have gone into gentle decay... That said, there are some real gems among the recommended onsens and half the fun is getting there..."
5,How to improve your credit score,I found this book to be of great value in understanding how to improve your credit score if you already are financially stable. This book will not do much for you if your finances are in the toilet.
2,A Sad Swan Song,"The last Abbott and Costello picture together is a sad, unfunny vehicle that is difficult to watch. When this film was made the team was off the screen for over one year and this outing was supposed to be their comeback film. Next to Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Cops, this is the team's worst film and finds its way into film collections solely because it is the team's last film together."
5,I got the GREATEST job by using this BOOK- everyone should!,"If you buy the book and read it you won't get a job.If you buy the book and follow the guidelines you will get a job, it will be the best job for you, and you will be able to negotiate a salary that's higher than you expecteed to get.It breaks everything down in a day by day step by step way and it works. I worked at a job I didn't like and couldn't get a raise and the book helped me get into a job that pays 20% more and has benefits and raises. The thing is you have to be motivated to follow the steps through. It helps you organize your campaign in the best and easiest possible way.Buy the book and work the book and you will have more confidence in yourself and have better opportunities."
3,Poor grammarian approach,"This book is not well sequenced, poor explanation source! You can use it to take grammar practices!"
3,cocktails,This book is fine. Doesn't have a lot of recipes. Pictures are good. Not a real bartenders friend.
2,A Missed Opportunity,"The information in the text of this book is excellent. It could have been a wonderful guide and reference book. But, it has no index, no glossary, no maps, and no pictures. For whatever reason, the author and editor passed on the opportunity to make this book really useful. If you read it, get out your own map of the region, then use a highliter, post-its, and anything else that will help you go back to find names, concepts, translations of French vinification words, etc. By doing what should have been done for you, the book will become a valuable resource."
5,Great cooker; overpriced vendor.,"Best rice cooker money can buy, IMHO. After 10 years of daily, family-of-four use, we decided it was time to get a new one (the old one still worked, but the vent parts had disintegrated over time, and rice quality was suffering a bit). However, you owe it to yourself to shop your local Asian grocery, if you're lucky enough to have one around -- we paid $105 for this model, made in Osaka, Japan, of course. This price is too high."
4,Useful & Disposable,"I don't usually wear an apron in the shop while I'm woodworking. But, after having ruined a few t-shirts and pairs of pants, I've learned to wear one when I'm gluing up or finishing. These aprons should prevent all glue, stain, and finish from getting on your clothes, unless you go totally crazy with brushes and glue bottles. When you get one of these good and gunked up, just toss it out. They come 5 to a package, and cost a lot less than a new t-shirt. If you're a true Scotsman, you can shred it and use it for rags. Simple, cheap, effective. Get some."
1,CAVEAT EMPTER,"Recieved aprons of different quality, different colors anD different material. Lost a sale and customer. FIRST TIME SHAME ON YOU. SECOND TIME SHAME ON ME. THIRD TIME SHAME ON BOTH OF US."
4,"The ""Trek"" to reality","Life-like androids,transporter beams and traveling at warp speed are just a few ideas from ""Star Trek""scients are working on right now!See how the science-fiction of the series is becoming science FACT.I like this book because it's neat to know these things will be REAL.I often thought as a kil watching Star Trek""Wouldn't it be great if we really had that?""Whether you like sci-fi,science or both you'll find this book fascinating."
5,Must to have for a J2EE developer (especially WLS developer),"Hi,There are MANY books on J2EE technologies today. Some of these are really good while others not.I'll surely put this book in the first category (worth it). Some of the features for which I really liked it are:a.) Comprehensive coverage of J2EE technologies and development through WebLogic platformb.) Use of practical examplesc.) Socio-technical content (fusion between human and software engineering principles): adds lot of value for the readers.If you want to be successful in learning, developing and implementing J2EE technologies and applications, it is for you. Even better, if your development is focused around WebLogic platform.Good luckPradi"
3,Retrun of the Aryans,My ordered copy did not arrive. It got lost in the mail.I have been advised that a refund has been made to my credit card.waiting for the card statementbharwani
5,Why is it doscontinued what a shame.,I own this model as well as the ZX-m. I concur with the other reviewers this camera is excellent. Much better than the MZ-S and other brands dollar for dollar. It's a shame it has been discontinued
3,Is this company listening?,"This COULD be 5 star pad. However, the adhesive strip is very poor. It has very little sticking power. I don't know if the company is using cheap glue or watering the glue down to save money. The bottom line is it just doesn't hold. It would help if it had wings. The rest is good--no harmful dyes, pure white pad."
5,Sad but Great!,"A well written, complete story of a great and sad life! There are still broken actors...but many fewer great ones!"
1,Not what we expected,"I bought this for my husband because I was tired of paying the full price in the department store. Unfortunately it did not smell like what we had bought before, and he said it even seemed to have been watered down, especially since it wasn't sealed. We probably won't go this route again."
2,Deceptive Description!,"The description listed for this game is incorrect. It has nothing to do with Russian prisons or the KGB or anything; instead, it's the game ""Traitor's Gate 2"" with a new package, and game play has to do with exploring ancient Babylonian ruins and avoiding spike pits. It's a sort of poor man's Tomb Raider, and not done as well."
4,Solid Musicianship,"I think that the musicianship, lyrical content, and overall flow of this album is good. The newer STD stuff is something that has to grow on you a bit. No doubt about it SWYA is one of the best records that this band has produced, but sound the alarm is no slouch. Chris has matured, and so has the band. Blink 182 was not the same after dude ranch, and it is arguable that blink sold out, but a band is going to shed its skin every few albums with the exceptions of some bands (e.g. rancid, NOFX), but give it a few listens and it will grow on you. It is the same old STD bass lines, riffs, but with a few twists thrown in. I will continue to buy their records until I read a eulogy at your funeral, pun intended."
5,really really good,This is one of the best of the year. Leaps and bound ahead of their last effort. Hits like a ton of bricks. Buy it!
5,An erotic journey into self discovery and exploration,"Originally written and published under a pseudonym, 100 Strokes of the Brush..., was well received in Italy, and later throughout Europe as a revelation, an account of a young Italian teenage girl's first forays into sexual encounters, beginning with a boy she liked, and later involving herself (while still legally a minor) with older men, and then in organized orgies. Melissa P. never looks back with regret in any of her adventures, as her sexual appetite and curiosity grow only larger and more powerful, leading her into what many readers may consider questionable forays. A film version was made of this book in Italy a couple of years ago, never to be seen in the US because of moral and religious restrictions. Nabokov's ""Lolita"" was for years banned in the United States under obscenity laws. This book makes ""Lolita"" seem like Walt Disney's Cinderella by comparison. Powerful book. Liberating!"
1,Snore.... so uninteresting.,"This book was trying so hard. I don't think it is impressive that a 16-year-old wrote it, as it reads totally like a high school assignment. Melissa sometimes even forgets the ""Dear Diary"" angle and just goes on and on like it's nothing. I kept finding myself rolling my eyes at her alliterations. I didn't find it anything -- not erotic, not scandalous, not repugnant, not even interesting. The only thing I found it to be was a waste of my time."
3,"Sexy, dirty, sad","This is a sad book that you cant help reading in the same way it is hard to not look at an auto wreck. At the same time it also has some very erotic moments, but sadly they don't leave you excited... The book just has to much of a dirty , grimy, nasty side to it. The world is a harsh place."
3,100 Strokes of the Brush,"A haunting, deliberately impassioned recount of a girl who is lost a fervored search for love - any sort of love.. tangible, physical, emotive, unrequited. And while the reader so easily detects this hunger, she rarely does. Instead, with her romantic constructs of language, she records her ironically innocent endeavors - trusting strangers and engaging in activities that would surely bruise the thickest of skins."
1,Product doesn't match the description,"The book itself is engaging and informative. I was just disappointed in the seller.The book was billed as nearly new but when I got it, there was a lot of writing within the book. Be careful who you buy from."
2,"Bitter, acidic","I really must disagree with the other two reviewers. I have found the aroma of this blend to be bitter, acidic and burnt. That carries over and makes for a pretty lousy cup of coffee. However, it isn't undrinkable and I suppose I'd put it on a par with what one would get from a cheap supermarket choice.Now, to be fair to Cafe Altura I want to note that there was air in my bag. I don't know if this is unusual or if they do not vacuum pack their beans (which would lead to oxidation fairly quickly and hence the bitter aroma)."
5,Great Cell Biology Textbook,"It is one of the greatest Cell Biology textbooks. Very well written, nice examples and amazing illustrations. I highly recommend it to the graduate and undergrad students.Two Thumbs Up !!"
4,Excellent Book for Studying E-Business,This book has proven to be a resourceful reference book in doing research in e-Business Model. As a student doing research on e-commerce this book is very helpful in my study. An up-to-date book content of both conceptual and technical review of e-Business Model.
3,Took Mr. Afuah's class at Michigan ....,"The book is (or was) an excellent primer to understanding the fundamental concepts of e-commerce. But while there are some business concepts thrown in (i.e. the 5 C's), they do not expand on those basic understandings of the Internet and its businesses. Anyone who had been following the Internet years via other publications would already possess the necessary knowledge that this book provides. If you don't have a good understanding, then at [$$$], there are cheaper alternatives.A great boost to this book would have been including a CD containing even one of Mr. Afuah's lectures. Mr. Afuah is a brilliant and knowledgeable man who challenges his students to think beyond just the basics. We were not able to get away with trite responses not backed up with data. Since this is hard to do through a book, an interactive CD could at least be somewhat useful."
1,I loved these boots!,"I loved these boots! I would get so many compliments on them, they're pretty, stylish, and comfortable. I putting them on the other day and as I was pulling them up the leather right above bottom elastic ripped! I don't think it would be possible to fix. The tear is about 3 1/2 in. long. I was so mad... they were gift for my birthday. For a leather boot at that price, or at any price for that matter, to rip the way it did in only 4 months... Not so worth it!"
3,Cassette tape makes all the difference,"I found this pamphlet/cassette guide to speaking rudimentary Polish very useful - because of the cassette. It was invaluable to hear people actually speaking the language, and be able to copy their pronounciation, accent, and stresses, rather than trying to decipher it based on phonetic symbols and pronunciation guides and invariably getting something wrong. The pamphlet came in handy afterwards - once I knew what a specific combination of letters really sounded like in Polish, it was easier to read the language.This would be extremely useful for a tourist because of the nature of the lessons - greetings, polite expressions, how to shop, how to order in a restaurant, telling time, asking for directions, etc."
4,"Very nice watch, just overpriced","I bought this watch for a trip to Curacao and lots of snorkeling. Overall the watch is very nice and does pretty much as I expected. The look of the watch is very attractive, although a little big like a regular dive watch. Compass did come in handy for navigation in unfamiliar areas. The only issues I discovered were as follows:Automatic time sync does not work in most foreign countries (manual only)Temperature feature only semi accurate, watch must be off wristButtons can not be pressed while submerged (will ruin watch ;)Compass reads for 5 seconds then goes static (pressing again updates)Watch illumination could be a bit brighter (best in very dark conditions)All in all I am very pleased as I will use this as my primary sporting watch. Would be a perfect deal at around $100."
4,too big,"I bought this watch for my husband and I like it very mutch except for the size. The color is not so bright as the picture shows, so I like it more. However, it looks too big. I offered my husband to return it but he loves the wath."
5,This book ranks high on my list....,"Definitely, Linda Leigh Paul should be very proud of her work....It really captures the spirit of Northwest design...When one asks, ""Why hire an Architect"",,,all one needs to do is show this book,,,it tells all....Again, a job well done!!!"
4,Little Girls' Dance Dream,"If your daughter loves dance and fairy tale romance, this is the tape for her. The colors of sets and costumes are bright, colorful and engaging. There is no dialogue, however Sally Struthers narrates the story while non-stop ballet sequences portray the action. Light drama while the toy soldier finds his way back to the toy room from the sewer. My eight and ten year old daughters both enjoy this film, and have insisted on renting it more than once."
1,Not so great!,I am a high school student. We are using this book as out textbook. I highly dislike the book because it does not come with any form or worksheets even end of the chapter questions. It is very hard to follow though may be informative. It is a very boring book and I would much rather read a different book and get less information than read a book that is so jam packed with information I can not take any of it in. It is just fact after fact after fact after fact. It is very hard to study from. I used to like history. Not anymore.
5,Great Bible for bible studies,wonderful and easy to understand. This is a great bible for bible studies. Bought it used but was in great shape! Thanks!
5,VERY GOOD LEARNING TOOL!,"I was suprised at how much I learned from this video. Being a newbie I wanted to learn more about cyberspace but I didn't feel like reading a long book on it. This tape covers all the bases and gives you a good overview of the Internet. I especially like the fact that the box has a time indexed table of contents so I can quickly find the subject matter I would like to review, for instance how to join a mailing list, download and install software or protect your pc from viruses. Plus, the tape pays for itself by showing you how to get FREE software, free e-mail and free internet access. I recommend The Internet for Beginners to anyone wanting to learn more about the Net."
3,The Internet for beginners is a good video for newcommers.,"The video was very educational. I, my self, am a beginner to a computer, so this video helped me out. The video did go kind of slow, but the time frame of the video was good. The video was easy to follow and showed you step by step how to do every application that the video covered. The video also defined the computer terms that it used ,so you weren't lost."
4,"Good to buy, but a little fast for the classroom.","This video is fery comprehensive about all the options and opporturtinites that the internet can offer. The video is, however slightly dated and some of the technical information is a little outdated. The video's speed is a little fast for a beginner trying to click along, or in a classroom environment, but if you are buying for personal use you can easily pause of rewatch protions that interest you the most. The length of the video, of course, only scraches the surface of the internet, but does give the audience a good idea of what the internet has to offer. Over all I would recoment this video to anyonw who is afraid of the internet and wants to learn more about it."
3,The video served its purpose fairly well.,"The video was appropriate for a beginner user of the internet. It was in simple language and fairly easy to follow. The headings and sub-headings were helpful, but the screenshots were a bit hard to read. The video was a little lengthy for me. Although it does take time to address all the points of the internet, this video dragged on. The video was a little boring for me because I am famaliar with most of the topics that were covered. However, I would recommend the video to anyone who knows little or nothing about the Internet, such as my mother. The video did cover a lot of important information and explained it in a concise way."
4,"Excellent! down to earth, fact-based!","I think this book is really good. I've researched health, weight-loss plans for a long time and I think Jim Karas has a very in-your-face, direct, fact-based approach that is hard to argue with."
4,Preston and girlfriend foil the unlucky wolf at the beach.,"I have to agree with the previous commenter that the book is over-wordy and just doesn't flow. However, I have to give it four stars on the grounds that any ""Preston"" book contains more originality, humor, and, well, zing than most other children's books. This one might interest the female Preston Pig fans, since it involves Preston's seaside friendship with a little girl pig. But please, check out the other Preston books like ""Oops"" ""Preston's Goal"" and ""Suddenly"", to see this little big at his best."
4,"Classic gold, x 2","As with the other Lewin book that I have reviewed, this is a timeless classic that showcases Lewin at his best."
5,The Watercolor Book: Materials and Techniques for Today's Artists,"After reading several books about watercolor, I found this book to be the best watercolor book on the market. It is the clarity and thoroughness of the explanations that make this such a valuable resource. I particularly found the section on color theory helpful. This is not a book with a few scattered tips against a background of gorgeous pictures of the artist's work. Rather, it is a master teacher reaching out to all levels of learners as he takes the mystery and confusion out of doing watercolors. If you were only going to buy one book about watercolor--this is the book!!The Watercolor Book: Materials and Techniques for Today's Artists"
1,Misleading for many,"I don't feel this is DVD is really for beginners, especially guys with flexibility issues.Many of the poses, especially in the first half are quite difficult and I feel more suitable for advanced students.However the second half of the DVD, involving floor work was a bit easier.Proceed at your own risk."
4,attempt at stardom,"loudon wainwright remains a cult favorite 27 years after his only hit recording which is not included on this albumwhat is included is a clever mixture of humpy dumpty protest songs and tender balladsas a lyrical humorist loudon's work reflects the spirit of the times-- nobody was taking anything seriuosly in the seventies-- Nixon saw to thatfrom liza-- a brief balland about a famous childhood neighbor, to i am the way-- a parody of christianity's roots, loudon manages to thumb his nose at everythinggangsters, politicians, babies, rock stars, girlfiends, smokers, are all parodied with musical abandon and a varity of styles from hard rock to bluegrass and all very aptly performedoverall a very enjoyable listen-- it was a real seventies style rush to see attempted moustache (fianally) available on CD"
3,Detective Work,"Had to search multiple sites to figure out what is on this new DVD. It has 2 of Bette's full length films, ""Of Human Bondage"" and ""Hell's House""."
1,Dreary,"I am a fifth grade teacher, doing this book as a literature set with my class. I am working hard to get the plot across to my kids -- it is opaquely written and hard to understand. Though the main character is a child, it is difficult for children to relate to him. I would not recommend this book for children younger than middle school -- if at all. You'll reach the end and think, ""So?"""
2,This is a very boring book.,"I read this book with a class of mine. I think the story of The House of Dies Drear is boring because there is little action. It doesn't have any funny parts either. I think if you are looking for a book to read, I would not recommend it."
4,"Nice mix of mystery, history, and father-son relationships","It's been a while since I've finished a book in 24 hours, but Virginia Hamilton's The House of Dies Drear moves quickly, almost every chapter ending with a cliffhanger of some kind that pushes forward to its satisfying conclusion. It's effectively a story about father-son relationships, smartly wrapped within a ghost story, as 13-year-old Thomas Small and his professor father learn the truth about the mysterious old Civil War era house the Small family moves into, outside Columbus, OH, and its connections to the Underground Railroad.Hamilton develops an engaging cast of characters, especially Mr. Pluto, the sinister caretaker of the house, and does a great job of weaving important bits about slavery and the Civil Rights era for context, without making it the focus of the story. For kids, it's a perfect complement to Christopher Paul Curtis'The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963. Highly recommended!"
4,I Remember a Good Book,I'm suprised at some of the reviews and wonder if maybe my memory is simply failing me! I'm 33. I logged on to see about getting this book for my 8 yr. old because this was one of my favorite books as a child. My 5th grade teacher read it to us. She would read to us every day after lunch and this was one of the selections and I LOVED it. I remember it being interesting and exciting. Now I have to wonder if it was just the fact that I love books and this woman was my all time favorite teacher. Maybe the book isn't as good as I remember. I'm going to have to give it a read to see.
3,The House of Dies Drear,The House of Dies Drear by virgia halmiton is a wonderful book the reason why I like it`s becouse of the things the characters do and the tuNnel they find under the ground .My favorite part of the story is when they scare the theifs that try to steal the jewelery in the tuNnel .you should read this book !!!
1,It was the worst book I have ever read!,It was confusing and had a horrible plot (if any). I read it in the 6th grade for Literature class and I fell asleep between each page because it was so boring!
1,From Top to Stop,"I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED BY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I first started reading it, but it grew to be so dull with barely any action. I read it in 5th grade (I am now in sixth), and it wasn't what I expected. Go with your opinion, but I'll stay with mine."
4,The Better Book Of My life,This book was good. I read it in my E.S.L class.I liked this book so much. It was about a man who was hiding a treasure. Mr. Pluto had it. Pluto was a man who could scare you so easily. The part of the book I did not like was the short ending. Give it a chance!!!!
3,It was ok,"I think the House of Dies Drear was good, but a little scary. It talked about the devil and used some foul language. Besides that it was good. It about a boy Thomas and his family who dicover amazing history, meet new people, and go on some pretty cool adventures. If you like mystery and action you will love the House of Dies Drear.By Ariel Birnbaum"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I IMAGINED!!!!!!!,"This book is good, because it's full of mysteries and yes, I do wish there's a tunnel in MY house. I mean, the mystery in the book is good, but not all of it. See, it's sort of boring, but not as bad, and not as good. I couldn't say it's average. So if you read my review, I guess it won't make you read, and won't make you NOT read. Okay?"
4,Just Started: Looks Promising,"I enjoy the positive encouragement in the text. After my first day on the program, I'm looking forward to the gains I see possible now. I have a few questions though. Bob Paris, please e-mail me."
5,trust me,i am very sure that this book is the best overall one of its type. this man truly knows his business and is very motivational as well.
2,Somewhat Unrealistic,"The reason I am giving this book at least 2 stars is because Bob Paris' intentions are definitely good. However the workout routine seems to be somewhat intense and a lot of work for a gym routine. I fear that most people who follow this workout will give up before they reach their goal. Compared to some more recent workout books, this one seems somewhat outdated."
1,did not work.,"It seemed like a great idea for my 89 year old father, but it is not stable. He fell from it twice and I had to retire it."
3,audio quality poor,"Hard to hear even when volume turned up, also was expecting more positive affrimations and not almost half a cd of spacy music. Loved her book ""feel fear"" but audio could use remake......"
5,Love this!,I picked up this DVD to help me strengthen my lower back. It is a good quick workout and I even noticed a reduction in my belly fat. I really enjoyed doing this workout and like that it is just 20 minutes!
4,Good book,"The book was very good at expressing the feelings of the mother/author. I have read better written books, but overall the book was very good!"
1,We aren't all self made millionaires with money to burn.....,"Let us please have a book/magazine that is targeted to the bride/bridegroom on a limited budget. Just because we don't have orchids, Dom Perignon and caviar on some veranda in the south of France, doesn't mean we can't have a beautiful, elegant wedding. Etiquette??? Bah humbug. It's the 90's. Who cares?? Etiquette went out the window with finger bowls in the 1890's. You don't need a magazine to tell you how to behave yourself in polite company.Why not target the second time around Bride? 50% of marriages end in divorce! This isn't my lst wedding, either. Let's get REAL.Thank you.Barbara Stevenson/Chicago"
3,Looks great...,"Had this for about 2 hours and there was a leak at the seam of the lower chamber. Its hard to get the water to start for the squirt gun. But it looks cool. Going to get another one to replace this one with the leak. Getting the gun set up in the float isnt as hard as other reviews let on. Its easy actually. So, the floats ok for a 5 or 6 year old. They can sit down in it with no problem and have fun with the gun. I give it 3 and a half stars."
3,skip the first six chapters,"I purchased this book expecting that it offered practical insights into SolidWorks functionality, as I was a neophyte user at that time and was hungry for a good reference work. However, the first third of the book covered very basic and generic drafting technique, from the importance of visual thinking to GD&T. These are the sort of things drafting students learn in their first year of college, and I was already very familiar with all these concepts due to my years of experience as a mechanical designer. If you are a recent graduate of a drafting program and have just begun using SolidWorks, this would be a useful book, and it's mainly for this reason that I gave it three stars. If you have any experience working in the industry, there are probably better aftermarket manuals available for the serious SolidWorks user."
3,Good all around CD,"This is a good compilation of famous baritone arias, nevertheless the renditions are not as good as the package itself. If you want to know what a baritone sings is Ok, specially for the price but if you want to really hear and enjoy a baritone voice interpreting the arias, forget about it. Maybe you'll be better off purchasing the Ramey-Hampson CD ""No Tenors Allowed""."
2,"Serious, yes. Good, no.","I honestly don't get why people think DG is that good. You certainly shouldn't mention him in the same breath as Dylan, as one reviewer misleadingly does. Gray has far more in common with Phil Collins. It's easy listening for the masses, and while he can write the odd catchy tune, like Collins used to, his music is no more than pleasant, slightly self indulgent, four minute ditties. Anyone who thinks he is more significant than that really should broaden their musical horizons, as indeed David Gray should himself."
1,HORRIBLE packaging,"This is actually my favorite calendar, but I was appalled at the packaging it came in - a huge box the size of four toasters with handfuls of air-filled plastic. I thought the box was empty at first, it was that big. What an environmental waste."
5,Incredibly moving & inspiring,"wow. this was a hard book to put down. it was exciting from beginning to end. taught that we should live and share our faith everywhere we go and with whoever we meet, no matter what the circumstances. an incredible journey for everyone!"
3,Lacks Energy and Continuity,"I bought this CD from reading the above reviews and have purchased other Doc Martin recordings (imperial dub recordings, volume 2, which is fantastic) and have also seem him perform a fabulous five hour set in Seoul. I was very excited to hear this CD, however I found this CD to lack any real energy and with no continuity between tracks leaves for a rather lifeless experience. There are some tracks that are quite good but others just seem out of place and have no ""pure"" house sound ie. track 2 sounds like a trip into outerspace rather than a trip to a dark underground night spot."
5,Steve McQueen at his best!,"It's Steve McQueen, what else can I say! The DVD's were wonderful to see after all these years."
5,Great Reading and Great Reference Book too,"Marty has done a great job in extending his great book on Core Servlets and JSP. An example, this is the only book out that covers the web deployment descriptors in a way that is understandable and very extensive. He has three chapters on this subject including a sample web application as a ""putting it all together"".He has a great writing style that is easy to understand and examples that are down to earth. I have sticky notes thoughout my copy and refer to it often when my brain fails me."
5,Great book!!,This is one of the better technical books that I have read. It is well written with great examples. I especially recommend it to anyone who is planning to use Apache's Tomcat. Tomcat documentation is horrendous and this book will save you many hours of scouring the net for good tutorials. I just wish I found this book before I went through that fate.
2,There are better online tutorials,"I'll keep this review short and sweet. If your a beginner looking for a book that will explain the fundamental requirements of developing and running Servlets, look elsewhere.The book's examples do not work and Mr. Hall does not go into detail about configuration issues, nor does he give the reader warning that the examples will not work unless the server is configured correctly.My advice is to the beginner is to read server documentation thoroughly, follow a few online tutorials, and then look elsewhere for some example code to learn from."
3,Well Written but Lacks Databases,"This book is well organized and well written but lacks some useful important stuff. For example, there is no discussion of JDBC and how to work with databases. Well, the author made a reference to a chapter in his previous book Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages, but it means you have to buy 2 books. The thing is Core Servlets and JSP discussed obsolete technologies (Servlet 2.2, instead of 2.3).I think rather than buying 2 books, you'd be better off looking somewhere else."
1,Worse than a hatchet job!,"I have this book. I bought it some 20 years ago in a book store in santa Barbara, at the same time i bought Petey Kurths book. Sadly, Mr. Lovell's book is worse than a hatchet job. I do not doubt he believed Anna Anderson to be Anastasia. I too believed for many years she was. Of course it has been proven she died with her family the night they were brutally murdered. Mr. Lovell paints a story that becomes so bizarre it is impossible to take him seriously much less Anna Anderson. If you like science fiction I highly recommend this book. If you want the truth, forget this book."
3,Character Study,"Jimmy Lovell did not know the DNA outcome. He died some months before the results, of an incurable illness. I knew him quite well. I was with him the night he first put pen to paper for this book. Yes, he was an amateur, but he had had this amazing encounter with this woman and few, really, amateur or not, could have just let it alone. She pulled him in deep and he of course was a believer. He did the best he could, frankly. I was skeptical from the outset, but then, I am a skeptic. My name is in the credits. R.I.P. Jimmy."
4,Beautiful contemplative music.,"Elizabeth Hainen does a super job on this CD with a broad range of pieces composed originally for harp. There is enough diversity among the selections to keep the CD from becoming monotanous. I found the Impromptu Op. 28 by Hugo Reinhold to be a surprizingly delightful work with which I was unfamiliar prior to purchasing the CD. The selections range from classical works by Rosetti, intricate and complex, to more emotional romantic works by Liszt.The solo harp has an odd immediacy and minimalism that can be quite meditative and pensive at times. Of course the solo harp can also be full of fluff and candy but there is little of that in this careful selection of music.Louis Spohr's Fantasie Op. 35 has a meditative quality, in which the silence between the notes is tangible. I recomend the entire selection of music."
1,Useless product,"I have esophagitis & Barrett's & was looking for a soothing product. This stuff (I've gone through 2 bottles to give it a fair trial ) does absolutely nothing. It tastes like purified water & that may be all it is.I'll try one of the competing "" terrible tasting"" products - maybe I'll have better results there."
1,Made me dizzy and queasy,"Not the fault of the quality control or anything -- I apparently had a very rare reaction, but this product is clearly not for me"
1,Water?,I think I may have just payed $30 bucks for a gallon of water. Tastes nothing like aloe vera and has the consistency of water.
1,irritated,I love this product I'm using it for my Macaws one of which is a feather plucker/chewer it has been working nicely my problem is that I ordered this gal. jug in plenty of time so I wouldn't run out and I have NOT received it yet and now you are asking me to rate the service/product. I'm very frustrated and want my product. Thank-you
5,Excellent and very well done.,A must see for ALL animal lovers and shared with all who need to learn the REALITY of puppy mills and large scale commercial dog breeders. Adopt a rescue or shelter dog!!!
5,Obra-prima de Akerfeldt e Steven Wilson,"Eu no gostava deste album, achava a música título muito longa, com a parte central ""boring"", mas isso ocorria quando ouvia a verso ao vivo.... Este album, com a produo das guitarras e voz feitas pelo Stven Wilson fez toda a difereana. Inclusive o próprio SW canta em Bleak e faz backing vocals nas outras músicas. Bleak é a melhor!"
5,No Mincing.,"I've read many long-winded album reviews where the writer gives examples of the shining moments, but to do so here would be condescending to Opeth. This album is simply excellent. Opeth makes albums, not 10-minute-epics strewn together in no determinate way to constitute what other lesser bands would call an album. Opeth is unlike any band I have heard, both complex and beautiful. I believe a new genre is being born: Progressive Black Metal. It will be interesting to see the influence of this superb band on the future. I can't wait!!"
5,Tool meets Cannibal Corpse.,"If you are a fan of hardcore, death metal, but also a fan of slower, melodic industeral metal then Opeth is the perfact band for you. Even though most of the songs on this album are around 8 to 10 minites + in time, it never gets lame. Unless your expecting all the songs to stay hardcore all the way through.Songs like The Harvest never get heavy, but are very good never the less."
3,falls short,"I thought this book was a good commentary on what it is like to be a vegan in this non-vegan world, but I found it lacking. I am not sure what I was looking for exactly, but this book didn't have it. I found myself feeling unfulfilled at the end. Although, I thought the authors were funny and there is good humor in the book."
3,decent but not bringing anything new to the table,"This book was written in a really warm style and the writers come off as very likable, that said there isnt anything really new in this book and all of the interesting points are from other (better) books. The rest is common sense stuff so this book is in a way pointless (sorry!) its like a light read for people who dont know anything about being vegan and dont know how to use google. If the writers were not so nice i would have given it a 1 because I dont think this needed to be produced there are better books out there...."
1,Poor Quality,"In my experience, Casio has a quality problem with this watch. The first one I had simply died after about 6 months - it took a shock (I bumped it), I think. I have NEVER had a watch die from getting bumped before. So... after months of waiting for the warrantee to fulfill, Cascio sent me a shiny new replacement. The replacement fails in this wonderful new way: Every month or so, it simply resets to midnight, January 1, 2000.Originally I bought the thing cause I thought it would be low maintenance. The manual says you must take very good care of it by making sure it gets ""fed"" light every day. Jeez. I also don't like how bloody thick this thing is. If I wanted to wear a grandfather clock, I would have bought one.Anyway.... save yourself the agony, and just go out and buy a ""cheap"" Casio, or a Timex Expedition. Or, with the extra money you will save by 2 or 3."
3,BAD MANUAL,This model has the worst instruction ever. It's not like the rest of the model i bought. it has triangle with number inside to tell you the color.What so funny i also bought 1/25 53 Ford Indy Pace Car Convertible 53.The manual was almost the same. it's like building the same model car just a lil different. I was disappointed building the same thing. So buy different year. please buy this model if u have experience not for kid.. I'll come back when it done and tell you more. so far i gave it 3 star for it cheapness..
5,All weather Rain Jacket,The jacket is what I expected. it has good quality For sure I will buy some more in the near future. Is a great asset in daily life.
3,What do you expect for US$5?,"I paid US$5 each for a batch of these. Would have preferred that they had plastic zips as I will be using them on a day tour boat for passengers should the weather turn nasty, so don't expect them to last too long. The material used is PVC so again durability is an issue, but for 5 bucks I'm not going to complain too much!"
4,Inspiring and enlightening. A good read.,This book reflects and mirrors our own inner state. I enjoyed reading about Mr. Altschuler's presence of mind and approach to life. I visited New England in the fall and I kept thinking about what it would be like to live in a small cabin and experience the quiet and my own mindstate under such conditions.
4,To be halved or not to be halved...which is better?,"The Nonexistent Knight and The Cloven Viscount were my first reads of Calvino's. These two novella's in one book made a fine interlude into a long series I have been reading and one in which I needed a break from. As in the Viscount in The Cloven Viscount, the book has two halves...one of which I really enjoyed and the other I only partly enjoyed.The Nonexistent Knight was superb! I absolutely loved it and found myself laughing out loud in hysterics. It was brilliant! However, I found it difficult to get into TCV. It didn't move as fluidly, didn't catch my attention and wasn't until about halfway through that I began to rather enjoy it and its philosophical underlinings. I highly recommend both, but I didn't feel TCV was at the same caliber as TNK."
5,gotta have them!,"I have found over years of hiking that this is the best product for footcare. Thanks, Thorlo!"
1,Not the best,"Last year when I was walking daily in the heat of the summer, the soles of my feet started peeling. A coworker recommended a brand called Balega. I bought a pair and was instantly hooked. They were very, very soft and smooth, and did a great job wicking away sweat. My peeling feet healed up right away.This year I bought a couple of pairs of these Thorlo walking socks on impulse, and believe me, you'll be better off with the Balegas. The Thorlos actually hurt the soles of my feet: they feel like Brillo pads to me. I guess the positive reviewers have tougher feet than mine.My recommendation is to get the Balegas. Amazon sells them, and they actually cost less than these Thorlos. Your feet will thank you."
2,Skimpy,"Disappointed by this skimpy book, which does not give very much good or useful information about this noted investor. There are a lot of statistics but not much texture or a sense of being taken behind the scenes.I think the Steinhardt book, No Bull, gives the reader a much better idea of what it is like to be on the hot seat and having the responsbility of managing so much money. Generally speaking, the very best of the genre from hedge funds is the Jim Cramer book, Confessions of a Street Adict, which was outstanding."
1,Don't waste your money on this pap,"I thought that no book could possibly have been worse than Strachman's truly awful Getting Started in Hedge Funds. My mistake. This book was far worse than I could have possibly expected, even from this author. It is a parody of a biography that makes magazine puff pieces seem hard-hitting by comparison. I will not waste any more words on this silly bit of wasted wood pulp except to say that it disgraces its author and its publisher while it covers its subject in wet kisses."
1,A Slick Piece of PR,"Boy, what a lame excuse at telling a story. Robertson's tale is one of rise and fall. After a stellar record Tiger crashed and burned. This surely needed to be detailed. It was not just a period of good and bad performance, but rather a time of collecting billions of dollars in performance fees when times were good and then walking away from his ""partners"" when the funds were ""under water"". The net effect was that fees far in excess of the 1% of assets and 20% of profits were collected. The readers need to understand what this means to a hedge fund investor and why this means a conflict of interest exists between fund managers and fund investors."
1,Not a book to be tossed aside lightly,"Rather, it should be thrown aside with great force.Pointless, mostly hagiographic recycling of the various articles on Julian Robertson.Unlike, say Lowenstein on Buffett, or Manes & Andrews on Gates, you will not find a comprehensive, insightful biography, nor any thoughtful discussion of the processes of investing and building a money management business.That book remains to be written, and deserves to be."
1,Expensive junk,"This was the worst pool toy we have ever purchased. It only lasted three days. It didn't pop, out just ripped apart at the seams. Complete piece of crap!"
5,living among meat eateaters,A great survival guide for vegetarians feeling alone among animal abusers.Challenging your normal way of thinking to become less defensive and more compassionate to non vegetarians.
3,Bunk perspective?,"At first glance, I thought I had an amazing find in this book. However, as a decade long vegetarian, I did not find answers to many questions that a vegetarian might face. The empathy is wonderful, yet I cannot agree with the author's theory that meat eaters are merely blocked vegetarians. The recipes in the back were great offerings and I did take something away with me from this book. But unfortunately, I found much of the information to be book filler material."
4,A worthwhile read for any fashion follower,"That luxury and style can be found in many places is the resounding message in this book. While the flow of the writing is occasionally choppy, the content makes reading this book an enjoyable experience. Every time I put this book down, I anxiously looked forward to the next time I could get back to Andre's remarkable story. How an African-American boy in 1950/60s North Carolina evolved from spending his 9-year-old's allowance on Vogue magazine to his critical break after college landing a volunteer position under the direction of Diana Vreeland at the Costume Institute is truly a page-turning read. This is a fast, easy read; suitable for anyone interested in fashion. Makes me want to go out and purchase a pair of buttery-soft Kislav gloves!"
2,A book that had potential....had...,"When I first saw this book I thought it had great potential. As an avid fan of the teen tv drama ""Roswell"" I thought, hey an alien, a girl....could be good. Alas I fear I was mistaken. ""Dancing with an Alien"" to me was full of sentimental nothing!.The scene was layed most colorfully but that is where the imagination stopped. I felt like I was reading a technical manual. The culmination scene in the end which the whole book builds up to, was like one sentence long. I'm sorry this may seem harsh but like I said I had expected more. I feel that this tale was only the bits and pieces of a once great, LONGER novel which I for one would have loved to read."
4,"Nice intro to Sci-Fi, but beware of some content","First romance is a tender time, and Logue handles well the feelings of the main characters in this novel meant for upper level teens, despite its easy read style. The Science Fiction idea of romance with an alien is also intriguing, but not well-developed. My only hesitation, the consumation scene toward the end which really wasn't necessary, unless Logue intends a sequal to this novel,if then."
4,dried porcini mushrooms,They were as advertised. Not the top quality but fine for what I need them for. I grind them into powder and add to recipes in equal quantities with soy sauce. Sposed to enhance umami flavor. Good value for the price.
3,"Not enough information on breeding, excellent photographs","It has excellent photos and it covers most of the boas and pythons you may purchase but, if you already have the snakes and you are looking for information about breeding them this book doesn't help much. It has enough information to help you make up your mind if you still haven't decided on what species to buy for breeding."
2,"Great photographs, not enough information.","This book has some great photographs, but does not say enough about breeding. Maybe breeding is very simple. If so, the authors should say so. When I finished the book, I did not feel that I had learned much about breeding. It was kind of like leaving a restaurant without feeling full."
4,ALL ROUND GOOD BOOK!,"THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD FOR THE NEW SNAKE OWNER AND THE UNSURE. IT HAS USEFUL INFORMATION ON MANY DIFFRENT TYPES OF BOAS AND PYTHONS. THE BOOK DOES NOT USE ""LARGE WORDS"" THAT COULD CONFUSE READERS AND THOSE IT DOES THEY EXPLAIN THEM IN THE BACK. I WORK IN A PETSHOP AND THE BOOK IS REALLY CLOSE TO THE REAL THING. IT'S A GOOD BOOK FOR GETTING STARTED. IT ALSO HAS GREAT PICTURES."
1,Poor clarity,I purchased the product for installation on aircraft side windows as others have installed similar peel and cling products with success. It was easy to install and get the bubbles out. It clings well. However the visual clarity through the product is poor. There are striation lines in the direction that would be across the role across the roll that are clearly visible when you look through the window at an angle. I am hoping these become less visible over time but it appears they are part of the manufacturing process.If it looks the same in a week after 1 day I will remove it entirely & chalk it up as a failed experiment. I don't recommend this product.
4,Fascinating read,"Law enforcement people, in their own words, talk about how it felt to take a life, to come close to taking a life and then deciding it wasn't necessary, and to see someone else pull the trigger. Well told stories, very believable. The author's interpretations and comments are also excellent, blending theory and down-to-earth observations with compassion. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with a kill-or-be-killed situation, you'll probably like this book. I enjoyed it as a trip into a land I hope I never have to enter except on the printed page."
5,Easy read - gives a new perspective,"Not a big fan of cops, but this was a very interesting read (except for the first 2 chapters.. I liked it from ""holding fire"" on...). It's full of anecdotes so it reads fast and you get involved in each one.It will give you a new perspective of when a cop draws his/her weapon and if you run into a cop after reading this book, trust me - you won't move and you'll do everything they ask!"
5,Into the Kill Zone,The book is an excellent resource for any Officer. The book offers insight in reference to deadly force situations and the aftermath. It is based on Officers experiences and perceptions.
3,Smarter than the title....,"Remember ""Ten Bloody Marys and Ten How's You Fathers?"" Or maybe ""Taking Liberties?"" Both of those were discs issued to sweep up the ever prolific Elvis Costello's B-Sides, soundtrack work and side projects. Unlike ""Liberties,"" ""Out Of Our Idiot"" has never been given a proper release here in the states. It's also slowly being rendered superfluous by Rhino's gradual issuance of bonus material on individual EC album reissues. Just don't count on me to slip this one onto a used disc sales list anytime soon. I'll keep it for the Spaghetti Western ""A Town Called Nothing,"" featuring Elvis' dad on the trumpet. Or his match-up with T-Bone Burnette on ""The People's Limousine."" Or an early flirtation of the Burt Bacharach catalog, duetting with Nick Lowe on ""Baby It's You."" Etc.....Worth it if you're a completist. (Like me.)"
3,great movie,"Excellent acting.Great subtitles and enunciation of the phoenetics. Yet, this movie is intended to support the book, sol y viento. If you take the class based on the book and this movie.... I hope you have an extra-ordinary instructor. The publishers spent most of their budget on this movie. With the $500 they had left over they decided to throw together a book.A good movie. I'd recommend to support your spanish learning that is not affiliated with the HORRIBLY WRITTEN sol y viento book."
1,Howard Miller Clocks,We own the Christmas Howard Miller clock and were very impressed. Ordered the bird version and had to return it because the sound was so low it could hardly be heard. The replacement was okay on sound but the hour hand is a half hour off and don't know how to repair that. Needless to say we were sadly disappointed with Howard Miller clocks.
3,broken,The Chalk was packed on the bottom of the box and only about 4 of the chalks did not break and the rest were in pieces.Need better packaging and placement other than that they worked pretty well.
2,Garbage. All the chalk was broken.,Either make thicker chalk or use better packaging because all the chalk was broken. Absolute garbage. I will never order this chalk by mail again.
3,Okay where chalk is concerned.,"Chalk is chalk, hard to complain too much, I just felt that these chalk sticks broke entirely too easily. I was a bit dissapointed, but all in all it's an ok product!"
2,Dusty chalk,"This was recommended by a friend who said it wouldn't ""dust."" I'm not sure if its because I'm using it on a painted chalk board table but it's terrible. It is very dusty and the eraser will not erase it."
5,A definite page-turner!,"I loved this book! I finished it the same day I bought it!Once you think you figure what happened you find out yourwrong and the person you think least likely to do it doesit. Kay Hooper mixes love, hate, and fear beautifully!"
4,interesting,"""Amanda"" certainly took me as a surprise. I have never read any of Hooper's books. I love mystery and romance all mixed into one, and this one met my expectations. It took me one day to finish this book because it was that good. No doubt the characters are complex and interesting. I thought Hooper could have elaborate on the relationship between Amanda and Walker. It was fun watching their conflicting relationship but I prefer Hooper building their relationship to a climax rather than all of a sudden in-your-face kind of love. However, I loved the ending! Overall, this book is a treasure to have."
2,"Great idea, weak book","This could have been a classic. It suffers from a number of faults which prevent it reaching that peak. It's too long (cut out 100 pages or so in the paperback to reduce to around 150) for the point which he seems to have aimed to make. According to other reviewers here, its badly edited, which may explain the sense I felt that it was a little disjointed. The idea underlying the book is that those generally identified as being on the Left are motivated in large measure by a need to feel they have a morally pure insight into, and solution for, any problem faced by a society, a trait exposed by Hollander in ""Political Pilgrims"". The idea was a good one, the book didnt, to me, live up to its promise. The reader will get better value and a far more enjoyable read, from Hayek, von Mises, James Bovard or Hollander."
1,I will get to the good stuff.,"What does that title mean? Does anyone know? Anyway, this is a bad book, plain and simple, even if you happen to agree with what this person is saying, there is nothing new that right wing wackos haven't already been squawking about. Once again, Sowell shows his readers that his compassion do not lay with his own people even though a disproportionate number are in poverty, jails, stopped by police, in failing schools, high school dropouts, low paid, etc. What are his ideas towards solving these problems? Where are his answers? More tax cuts?But rather, Sowell's compassion rests with the majority, people who had every chance to succeed in life. Sowell does not see this fact. Sowell does not care about this fact. This book is just like his last one offerting nothing new and this is certainly the last time I will read a Thomas Sowell book. Another ""pat on the back"" for right wing conservatives, this is a book to throw in the trash."
2,Not Sowell's Best Work,"The book started out very good, it provided thought provoking ideas backed up with logical evidence as Sowell's books normally do. The remainder of the book which was precisely the next two-thirds, however, could have been done in fifty pages as opposed to the painfully repetitive one hundred-ninety or so that it took.He took a few ideas and repeated them over and beat them to death until, in the end, he told the same stories a dozen different ways.The message he provides in this book is very valuable and it is good information. I have read numerous other Sowell books and find them very valuable. However, the style in which this was written was too repetitive and the message could have been delivered in less than half the pages."
5,Vision of the anointed,"One of the most insightful books I have ever read. If every high school in the country had this as required reading , progressive nonsensical ideas would virtually disappear. I am so thrilled with Thonmas Sowell's simlple but elegant logic and his carefully referenced facts that shatter commonly held misconception that I intend to read all of his many published works.This one should be rated a 6 on a 5 point scale.Jim Benefiel"
1,"Simplistic, Moralizing, and Poorly Written","I am not impressed in any way with Lynne Cheney's book. The book's sloppy writing and convoluted construction add little value to an already simplistic retelling of the Washington story. The condescending, moralizing tone of the book also makes it a poor choice if you want young readers to develop a more realistic, honest view of one of our most memorable, accomplished presidents. I truly can NOT recommend this book."
4,Great product if you are willing to do the work,I think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week.
1,Missed the mark,"These ""brilliant"" scientists, masquerading as enlightened political thinkers, missed on this on. No huge flows of refugees, no public health crisis--means no credibility for their arguments. Stick to physics."
5,Smart Money packs in the flavor!,Smart Monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars.... and the Carob Brownie are the best. They have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store! Well done to whomever came up with the recipe... you ARE a smart monkey!
1,Worst Nokia ever,"I have used Nokia cellphones before and this was the worst.I brought it because I needed something for emergencies, had it for four months, topped up and went to make a call the phone was dead.. Waste of money"
4,Works for me,"I'm an adult, infrequent user.Pros:Small, no antenna, don't have to flip open, sunlight viewable, voice activated dialer, speakerphone, automatic keyguard, calendar, easy texting modes, good value plan at $5/month with carry forward balance, voice clarity and communication is good.Cons:Doesn't show who left a voice message, dropped out and had to remove battery twice to reboot over the past year, sometimes shows a weak but operating signal but won't actually connect.So, it works for me, I'm happy with it. Set up my Mom and father-in-law with this phone also."
1,Auto-shutoff support,"I purchased the Nokia 2115i and before opening the package I searched for reviews of the product (I know that this is backwards, but such is life). I noticed here of users reporting the auto-shutoff problem that requires the battery to be disconnected. I searched the nokia site for details and found nothing. So I called them on a Saturday morning, 9 AM PST. After 15 minutes, a support person answered. She put me on hold for about 30 seconds and said that her ""tech"" said nothing has been reported, there are no service bulletins on this model and that ""my phone does not have any problems"".I happen to work as a software tester and know all about bugs. The fact that I got a glib response worries me. No searching of bug databases, only a quick opinion of one tech who cannot possibly have such expansive knowledge of this model (1 of 100 models Nokia offers).I will return my phone today to avoid the risk. Thanks to all who took the time to report a problem here."
1,NOT A GOOD PHONE,I should not even give it one starI will give it no star.Bad Things-can not hear when you are talking to someone-batterie dies SO fast-The bottons are wayyyy to small-the screen is really smallI could go on all dayGood Things-ohh i forgot there is noneBottom line DO NOT GET THIS PHONE
1,lookout guy,"Hey LyndaI think that you should read it this review again. I should point out that some of the plans contains hidden fees like the minute 2 minute plan. They charge you 25 cents for the first 10 minutes before you can get 10cents a minute after that. If you use ony 10 minutes its $2.50. 20 minutes will be $3.50 and so on.If you think about it's almost just like a $1.50 access fee which is included in the first ten minutes. Also When I was doing the math, I was making an assumption that the average number of minutes of usage per month was 300 minutes at an average of 10 minutes per day for 30 days straight which is roughly the normal amount for people who don't use their cell phones often. It is only an estimate. I'm just trying to point out the fact that even if you don't use your phone every day, and if you add up all the days that you actually use you phone along with the cost that was assess that day, you will realize that it is not really worth it."
5,The greatest memoir of a generation,"Written more as a military memoir than a personal, Grant proves to be an outstanding author as well as a General. Reading this set me off to find more about the General's personal life. I highly recommend to anyone interested in the Civil War, you won't be disappointed."
1,Not helpful,I was hoping to use these as study material while I took my chemistry class... Tried to use them once but they weren't helpful. Waste of money don't buy.
3,Thorough if unbalanced view of the faith,"As a novice student of Islam, Christian by birth and nurture, I found this book to be a real treasure trove of information. The voice of the reader is a bit grating, but once you get past that, he delivers, from a reasoned and experienced perspective, a tantalizing view of both the practice and historical politics of Islam. This was my second book on the subject, and it held my interest completely.Gare Henderson"
3,"again, not worth it","Poor instructions, 2 drawer fronts were scratched, gave us the wrong feet. We also bought the hutch top for the dresser and it does not sit ontop of the dresser the way it should. Looks nice once together but a pain in the ass to get it to look that way."
2,"Looks nice, but hard to put together with some defects","First, when this is all put together, it is a very nice looking piece of furniture.However, putting it together was a chore. Plan at least four hours of your time.Also, there are a few minor defects. For example, when the side door on the right side of the dresser is closed, there is about a half of a centimeter gap between the door and the outside of the dresser. It is small enough so you can't see anything inside the dresser, but once you notice it, it annoys you every time you look at the dresser. Also, the top drawer is a little tilted. These aren't major, and they may not affect every unit, but for a $400 piece of furniture, I expected more."
1,Pre-marathon dietary advice,"The author suggests eliminating salt from one's diet for 24 hours prior to the marathon, supposedly because the intake of salt would lead to dehydration. This viewpoint is in contrast to the majority of runners and authors who encourage the runner to eat some salt during the morning meal (bagel with salt), and to carry pretzels to eat during the last half of the race when electrolytes have been depleted. Total elimination of sodium prior and during the race, along with continual ingestion of water can lead to hyponatremia."
1,horrible,"I thought this book was just plain awful. Just plain awful. It was nothing but a big fight scene and the characterization was non-existent, and the characters were pointless, and... I could go on. Of course, everybody has their own opinion, but I don't think this book was worth the $7.00."
3,alright,"g-unit's singles seem to only be worried about the consumer and by the looks of these reviews they have failed on this one...song is ok, but the rest of G-Unit's Beg For Mercy brings the heat...personally, invest in some of their mixtapes if you wanna see real talent. lloyd banks is on next son."
1,so bad!,"This group sucks this single sucks and 50 cent sucks!Why can I say good things 'bout them? 'cause they sucks, I can't say any good things about this weak crew (may be the worst and the baddest).A question, where is the 0 stars rating in thi website for this type of cd (weak)?"
2,Software kills me,"What I like: manual stop/start, per lap statistics, integration of features.What bugs me 1: The speed reading can't seem to decide if it's using GPS or the speed sensor. Demotivating when you're pushing yourself and in some trees and the speed shows at least half of what you know you're doing.What bugs me 2: Altimeter seems off and there is no way to calibrate it that I can find. Perhaps it's just how altimeters work, but often it shows me at -200 feet. I suppose the most important piece is that it shows the change in altitude correctly.What is going to make me dump it: Very regularly I go to import the ride data into my PC and it says it's imported successfully, but the data never shows. And is gone from the device. Lost forever. I've lost data from big rides that I was very eager to see. Huge bummer. Rebooting seems to help. But I don't want to have to reboot my pc every time I ride."
1,Almost worthless,I agree with the previous reviewer and am just reenforcing his/her opinion. Some things are cheap and still over-priced. The Barron's Gettings By in Chinese is a much better value.
4,Option Trading for the Conservative Investor,"This book is well written with relatively clear examples given for complex topics. It tends to be repetitive, but options trading is complex so the repetition is a plus. The author is very consistent in his conservative investing approach. He explains each trading scenario thoroughly and justifies the conservative approach for each. This book will be a cornerstone of my investment library for some time. I highly recommend it for both readability and practicality. If I was pressed to offer a suggestion for improvement, I could suggest more examples of each strategy. Although the examples used are clear and easy to follow, option trading is very complex; in my opinion the more practical examples the better."
5,great,it was awesome but my blu-ray player was messed up so I had to play it on my ps3. so its all good
4,I'II TAKE SWEDEN,"A WONDERFUL FEEL GOOD MOVIE,WITH MANY AMUSING MOMENTS, THE THE VERY FUNNY BOB HOPE IS CLASSIC,AND FUNNY AT HIS BEST.GREAT SUPPORTING CAST WITH TUESDAY WELDS AND FRANKIE AVALON. A GREAT SATURDAY IN MOVIE."
3,Book is a good starter into solving the problem,If you have done any internet research on MVPS you will find the book rather basic for your needs. It does give a fair overview and offer the right path to solutions.
1,Discouraging,Reading this book was more discouraging than anything else I've ever encountered. It is a sobering reality check -kinda like telling your 7 year old kid that he's never really going to be an astronaut. The author makes everything sound soooo terribly difficult!I've now recovered from reading the book and am just going to go for it on my own. I do not recommend this book to anyone -the info is not worth his powerful dissuasion tactics.Does this guy want to be the only inventor in the world or something? What is his problem?
5,Linkous does power pop,"I love the music on this one. ""Ghost in the Sky"", ""Mountains"", ""Knives of Summertime"" are amazing. Best music he's done. The words are not up to ""Wonderful Life"" level, but I can't argue with the music.Not sure what ""Morning Hollow"" is doing on here, though. Seems to break up the flow too much. It's a good song, but this is the exact same version from ""Wonderful Life"". I'd advise skipping it -- album plays better just listening to the pop tunes."
2,Too tippy,"Looks like it should be fun...but just way too tippy. We tried to let some air out of the log, but the kids still fell right off. Never even got around to knocking each other off."
2,"Impossible to stay on the logs, just not worth it.","We have a lot of kids over to swim, and everyone tried to use this toy...and no one could even stay on the log to try and fight. They eventually just beat each other up with the sticks, and that would lead to fights. Anyway, of all the toys we bought, this one went in the trash the fastest."
2,LOG FLOATS,This product is really hard toplay with and control. the grand-kids did not like it at all.
4,Sports watch,Good sports watch. Much better than the other Casio I had. Compass has continous operation for a short time as opposed to one reading. Solar power should be nice since I won't have to chance the battery (which caused the demise of my previous watch).
4,Good audio cassette abridgement of Classic book.,"The DH Audio cassette read by Nanette Savard is a good adaptation of the MacKenzie's Mountain book. Nanette does a great rendition of a prim southern school teachers voice. Her voice for Joe was also good, while I felt her voice for wolf was only ok.However, the abridement was done very well. If I hadn't read the book multiple times, I would have caught the changes; and changes there are.Where scenes occur and who speaks what lines are changed. Many if not all of Joe's scenes are cut. However, for the abridgement, this works. This is a pretty good audio cassette to rent if your a Linda Howard fan. Enjoy!"
2,I couldn't even finish it...,"I decided to try a Linda Howard book when I saw that it was in the top 5 sellers. However, the story was one big cliche. I was so bored I couldn't even finish it. Who wants a main female character who wears ""housecoats"" and who is so dorky that the reader doesn't even like her? Give me Nora Roberts or Susan Elizabeth Phillips anyday!"
2,Not very good...,"The Toy Story movies are two of my favorite movies. But the game however, is not too good. The graphics are awful, they are very flat. The graphics in the Toy Story Activity Center are WAY better. The game play is ok, but there are some levels that are impossible to beat. Save your money and get the Toy Story 3 disc set on dvd."
2,Not very helpful,"I bought this book thinking it would be full of wonderful advice, but I really did not gain a thing from it. I get much better results from communicating with my horse, rather than threatening him. Also, the advice on mounting a tied horse is outright DANGEROUS! DO NOT DO THAT! When I started my horse, he was hard to mount, so I just taught him the verbal command of 'stand' (which I use for all kinds of other things too, not just mounting) and now he knows to stand quietly when I ask. I agree with another reviewer, Pat Parelli and John Lyons have much better advice."
1,The worst thing you could do to horses,"The worst thing you could do to horses is to follow the advice of Mary Twelveponies. This book and her philosophies are based on the principle: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. She often refers to the holy book. Maybe she seeks an excuse when she hit horses with nails if they bite. She likes to punish horses with a whip if they don't obey. She says serveral times: you have to be the boss. So you whip a horse on the foreleggs firmly if he does'nt listen? When I finished the book I was alsmost shaking because of disgust. Unbelievable that these kind of people may spread their word in print. This book should be put into a huge bonfire. I am relieved that there are other authors like John Lyons and Pat Parelli. Those persons deserve respect."
1,Single-use Single-variable Calculus Textbook,"The examples in this book are insufficient both in quantity and quality. Stewart only uses one basic example problem for most of the topics and leaves you to figure out advanced concepts by yourself.When taking Calc II, I was forced to supplement the inadequate help offered by the poor examples of this book with other textbooks and frequent Google searches. This book was definitely not worth the exorbitant amount of money for the few times that it was actually useful."
3,Fantastic True Crime Story,"A well told story. Junger does a great job of laying out the facts of not only the Spring 1963 murder of Bessie Goldberg but also the Boston Strangler case. No assumptions are made and when all is said and done, we, as readers, are left with the same questions we started with - Did Roy Smith kill Bessie Goldberg? Was Albert DeSalvo the Boston Strangler? And lastly, on a more personal note for the author - What if Junger's mother hadn't left their Belmont home that Spring day in 1963?Recommended for True Crime non-fiction fans."
2,Pretty Confusing,"After reading the reviews by Alan Dershowitz in the New York Times and Joshua Marquis in the Wall Street Journal I had serious questions about this book so I bought it.Reading the book you'd get the impression you have all the information, but then after reading some of the more critical reviews and comments by the victim's daughter it becomes clear that there are some gaping holes and apparently even big mistakes (like placing the daughter in the courtroom when the verdict comes down when she was apparently not even there)Junger has set a very high bar for he calls a work of journalism, more than just non-fiction, and by that standard the book should be read ""with caution"" as Prof. Dershowitz suggests in his review."
1,Poor Journalism,"The daughter of the victim correctly complains about ""A Death in Belmont"" because the strong evidence which convicted Smith and the affirmed convinction after an appeal to the Massachusettes Supreme Judicial Court are withheld from the readers."
4,Ode to Werner (Verne) Hippler and the XFL,"This team started out the XFL with a bang withthe highest rated prime time Sports game ever,a 10.2 rating. But as the season went on, theywent through five QBs and three TEs (includingHipp) and despite Rod 'He Hate Me' Smart, Ian'sbrother, Hipp, Kelvin (Tom G) Kinney, et, al &a very good Coach (one of three over from NFL E),they collapsed to 4-6-0 and the League went underafter only one year. They could have developed intoa very good Pro 'AAA' League, but were too anti-NFL (not that the NFL is all that either - I pre-fer the CFL and Ar.FL, for what it's worth. Lovethe Pro Bowl in Honolulu though. Long live thememory of the USFL and XFL as potentially viablealternative Leagues to AAFC, AAFL, NIFL, UIFL,Af2and of course the overrated NFL E! Oh, getthe T-shirt. It's mucho cool!"
3,first experience with EPA-DHA....,"EPA-DHA supplements were recommended by me by my doctor after I learned of potential deficiencies during the grey, ugly months of winter. I am not certain if the Omega 3 fats are going to help my health or not. All signs point to possibly. I do know that this oil helps with the metabolism and cardiovascular health. We'll see."
3,Nuala's Long Journey,"This is the first book by Nuala Faolain that I read so I don't have anything to compare it with. I am also a middle aged woman so many of the statements she made hit me right in the chest.I could feel her pain. Although I related to her story, I found the book tedious at times. I would not recommend this book for everyone. I don't believe that women in their twenties or thirties would fully appreciate Naula's story."
2,Good sound but not in tune,"The whistle was ok and had a good sound, you just can't play with anyone else because it was out of tune and is not tunable. I also got some Kildare whistles at the same time and those are tunable and sound OK."
4,Treat for Elizabeth David fans,"This book will be a delight for Elizabeth David fans. She provides background and historical information on a range recipes and food topics. As always her recipes are easy to follow, simple and delicious, but this is not the usual recipe book. It is rather a series of essays on food. If you are curious about cooks, cookery, food, recipes, particularly those of European origin, you will enjoy this book. It does not contain glossy photographs or step by step instructions in basic cookery, rather it explores more unusual items. Very enjoyable bedtime reading from arguably the greatest 20th century English food expert."
4,Great jazz rock with horns and blazing guitar licks,"It's a nice disc. Kind of a looser version of Chicago. Less pretty vocals, but nice and lots of rock guitar licks and horns for a jazz/rock/blues fusion feel. This release is Keef Hartleys most Rock and Roll sounding as compared to the bluesey previous material. I feel that every song, including the bonus tracks is a keeper. Is it comparable to Magical Mystery Tour, No but its a fine peice of 1970 music that I'm pleased to own. Of all the Hartleys I own I must say this is overall the best."
3,Good But Not Great,"Stevie Wonder is an excellent artist because he has had so many memorable songs during his career. However, this 2-CD compilation is not good enough because I don't know who would want this (not to mention certain hits missing). If you are a Stevie Wonder fan, then you probably have his 4-CD ""At The Close Of A Century"" so you don't need this. If you are a casual fan, then the ""Definitive Collection"" is your best choice since it's one CD and enough songs to justify buying. This collection is just too much for a casual fan."
3,Wonder About Motown,"For a performer who has been around for the better part of four decades, this is a good overview of his middle period hits but could have been far better. Way too many omissions for my taste. I guess if one had to buy just one album of Stevie's, this would be the one. However, for the best overview, you'd probably be better off with Greatest Hits 1 & 2, Talking Book, Innervisions (one of the best of the 70s), etc. This particular package neglects a lot of his earlier work and is not a good representation of his career. The man has just had too many hits for two CDs to hold."
4,R-12,great product ... cleaned my honda generator carburetor and it ran like new. It can be added to gas so that it continues to clean the carburetor while the generator is running.
3,a survey of interpretative methods for liturgy,"The book reads like a summary of something else, and I would guess that the something else is her book, Liturgy, the Language of Faith. I am a parish priest and looking for insight into interpreting liturgy. From the book I learned that the historical-critical method was adopted heavily by the liturgical reform to critique early church sources, redactions, rites, etc... and that now literary criticism is having its turn. But the complexities of the individual fields are still lost on me--I still would have a hard time explaining what reader-response criticism is, let alone apply it. So I am encouraged by the many footnotes to pursue additional reading. In sum, the book lays out the state of the question, but assumes a good working knowledge of the field."
3,works,Does it's job. It's rather thin but washable and protects the bassinet mattress. Can not keep up with big blow outs or spit ups tho. Bummer.
2,The fabric is so bad,"After a couple of washes it is not usable any more, not soft at all. However it fits perfectly. You might be better off using a soft cotton pillow case of yours."
3,Alternative to this sheet,I've read other reviews elsewhere which suggested using any pillowcase of your choice instead of this sheet. That's what I'll be doing.
2,Okay Sheets,"Given that these are the only sheets (that I can find) that fit my Graco Travel Lite, and the fact that I LOVE my Travel Lite, these sheets are fine. They are not super-soft or plush, but the serve their purpose. They protect the padding of the bassinet from spit-ups and leaking diapers, they launder easily and don't shrink or fade. I have a set in pink, that I used for my daughter and just purchased a set in sage, for my unborn son. Although, sage is no longer available in stores and I may have bought the last two from the only seller of the sage ones on Amazon. I do not like that the ONLY store that carries them in Babies R Us, and the only colors available are pink or creame - no boy colors at all."
1,Unnecessary - use a standard/Queen pillowcase instead,"After reading all the reviews here and on other sites, I tried one of my own pillowcases (100% cotton, much more desirable than the poly/cotton blend Graco used with their cover) and it fit perfectly. There was only about an inch or so on the end to tuck under at the foot and the sides were perfectly snug. A very tight, good fit that doesn't buckle the mattress as I read on some other reviews of this product. No need to waste your time/money on this questionable product!"
1,Not 100% cotton!!,"These are not good quality, cotton sheets, they are mostly polyester (65%). I bought the travel lite crib, which is really nice and cute, but was disapointed to see that these are the only sheets that fit it well. Other brand sheets are too narrow and raise the mattress.I really expected that a good brand like Graco would make the best quality sheets for its products. Even though the color and fit are perfect (as they should be, to match the crib), I hate polyester sheets, and do not think it's healthy or really comfy for the baby. For the money, these sheets had to be 100% cotton, and made me somewhat disapointed about having bought the bassinet in the first place."
2,It is a sheet,"It is so thin you can easily see all the pictures on the mattress. The only reason we will keep it is that my wife used it as an example to make her own sheets for the travel bassinet. The reasonable price for this small piece of fabric should be 3.99 max (1 dollar goes for packing). It fits Graco travel bassinet fine, but it is very overpriced for what you get."
5,Grammy's wonder,I love my new Pack and Play for my new grandbabies. It's easy to assemble and use. The bassinet and changing table features are great! Very happy with the product.
3,interesting reading,"The book was filled with lots of information but didn't have the recipes that I was searching for, although there had been a link to it.It was interesting reading and I might make some of the flatbreads."
5,must have bread book,This is a great book. It offers many alternatives to the standard yeast bread. Also many ethnic breads. Good explainations and photos.
3,Diminished expectations,"This book is full of great travelogue info and personal insights, but unless one is a devoted baker with all the right equipment, many of the recipes are difficult to reproduce or need to be adapted."
4,Miro,"What can I say about Miro's art? I love it. Art is a purely subjective thing. I enjoy the subtle technigues you notice in his art when you look closely. Sitting back and absorbing the art allows all sorts of images to come to mind. Miro has some very lovely backgrounds for his work, using shades of color to add depth and a sense of realism to his work. Some of my favorites are ""femme et chat"" and ""animal composition""."
1,Disappointing,"While still not finished the book, Barry Miles writes much like J.K. Rowling wrote the first couple of Harry Potter books - for a twelve-year-old.While others have criticized Miles for his lack of first-hand research and reporting (all true), I find the tone of the book extremely pedantic and simplistic. Miles seems to revel in the profane language common to Zappa's oeuvre. He also enjoys writing short sentences. These follow each other frequently.This book is extremely simplistic and fails to shed new light on Zappa the man, or his music. Having read several other biographies of Zappa (as well as a great deal of other material), I find that there are many better options out there. I highly recommend Kevin Courrier's ""Dangerous Kitchen..."" for first time Zappa enthusiasts."
1,Terrible,"If you were going to write a biography of a person, you should at least be able to get the date of death correct."
2,Charging too much...,"I love Coheed, but they just aren't very good live. Claudio focuses too much on taking the lead guitar parts and not enough on singing. But even worse, I paid 1 cent (literally) for this EP at Best Buy. You don't need to pay 5 bucks plus shipping and handling."
1,Miuchiz Pawz is a let down,My son got this for Christmas and was very excited until we tried to update the software on the handheld. It says you need to feed the pet which we do. Then we follow the steps and put it in the USB port. The update software does not detect the handheld. When you go back and check the handheld the pet is no longer happy and fed. I've opened 3 tickets on this so far and have only got a generic reply on the first one which didn't help. This company does not seem to be for the kids in this aspect. Are they just out to sell a product even if it doesn't work. I see in other reviews and checking this product on the internet we are not the only ones with this issue. It would be nice to post something on their web site as to a fix or if we have a bad handheld. I would not recommend this product to anyone and those who got a good one you were one of the lucky ones.
1,"Cool Concept, But it Doesn't Do Much","Because of the advertising blitz, my son really wanted this gadget for Christmas. When we got it, we found that it really doesn't do much of anything. The controls simply don't work the way the manual says they do. We also hooked the device into our computer so that he could supposedly use it in an online environment, but nothing happened. We logged on to the product's website, but the device still wouldn't interact. We basically have an electronic paperweight."
2,Fair tube,"I bought this tube to carry my scientific posters. The posters are 3 feet by 6 feet. This is just about the limit for this tube. The ""locking"" mechanism that keeps the tube extended is not stable and can unlock easily. I had a poster become unfastened in the tube and had to destroy the poster to remove it. The tube itself is light."
5,"GREAT COLOR, SOUND AND STORY!","For those of you that don't remember the episode titles here they are spread out over four discs:Disc One1. The Quest2. Dishonor3. Break Up4. Betrayal5. VictoryDisc Two6. Andorus7. A Drop of Darkness8. The Beast and the Bell9. Panacea10. King NiddlerDisc Three11. The Collection12. The Little Leviathan13. The Darkdweller14. The Dark Disciples15. The Ghost Pirates16. The Dragon MasterDisc Four17. The Game Players of Undaar18. The Pandawa Plague19. Sister of the Sword20. The Soul Stealer21. The Living TreasureEach episode is 22 minutes because there are no commercials.I also have ""Thundarr the Barbarian the Complete Series"" for sale."
2,Junga wunga,"No fault to manufacturing on this crisp collection of four discs. However, either because I did not watch this show growing up or am not sentimental lately, I did not enjoy this. It replaces what I like about pirate fiction with campy humor and silly jibberish is just practiced too much. I owned a few of the action figures released in the early 90's and they were actually pretty cool. Unfortunately my imagination saw deeper stories attached to these interesting looking characters and this show does not have any of that depth."
4,Good show,My husband enjoyed this as a kid and wanted me to watch it... I thought it was good... Kinda wish it would have kept going to see if they got the rest of the treasures or not
4,original version?,"When Tim and Sigourney are going through the chompers, what does she say? I know in the original movie she says the F word and thats the copy I would like to have."
4,"Well Done, Easy to Follow and Play Rock Sampler","First the quality: very good, with chord diagrams, notation and tabulature. It's a clear and easy way to learn the songs. Lyrics are easy to find, though small. It is an eclectic sampler of every decade of rock since the 50's including Fats Domino, Korn, Van Halen, the Eagles, Pantera, Don McLean and Sheryl Crow. Really good songs cover most rock styles...and that's where it shines."
3,Edit me please,"This book is exactly what it claims to be...a textbook. I didn't realize the description was literal. My bad. The reading is generally pretty dry, and one only barely gets the sense the authors have done any trading themselves. Nonetheless, they seem to know the subject matter well, and I have gleaned some useful insights. My chief complaint, however, is the poor editing (or maybe a lack thereof). I would be embarrassed to have my name on the cover of this book. The errors are numerous. The errors go beyond annoying and are often distracting. E.g., several charts are mislabeled. The reader is referred to chart ""xx.x"" and quickly realizes the narrative is totally unrelated to the chart in question. Flip back a page, forward a page...maybe this is the right chart. Yes, this must be the one they are really talking about. Sloppy! Very sloppy! Don't either of you have a grad student that needs a project?"
3,Big Noyd - Not Wack,"Best offering out of the Mobb for a while. Two songs make the album - Stick Up Kid and Say Whatever You Want. Some beats have a too much soul/motown feel to them for me and I hate to say that most of the guest appearances of other infamous mobb members are weak. P has a good verse on song 4 (he actually rhymes on it, remember those days?). The havoc song is good too but the hook on the chorus is unfortunatly unimaginative. Noyd's versus are solid as always, he shows a wide breadth of styles, fast and slow, gangsta and reflective. I was surprised by the evolution of his rhyme style too: some really intelligent similes and word play. If he cut out some of his boys who were dissappointing (not Twin, who was dope) and had some more of the hard, get pumped beats, this would be a 4 or 5. If you loved Noyd ten years ago (like I did and do) this is a definate BUY."
1,"Hardly worth the trouble - Expensive rubbish, weak and really not suitable at all. Not sure why they bothered",This Cam was/is to fit my camper top on my pickup. I had to crush the arm to give it some strength - which seemed to help but the little screw that secured it is useless. I think the metal was not heat treated properly and the thread pulled out and I lost one arm within hours of driving down the road. Expensive and useless product. The bolt is soft as well. Maybe they were supposed to be treat together and they both missed.. Perhaps a bad batch... Don't waste your money. - And if you want to overcome/break in - the cam/lock - just pull a little harder and gives way allowing you to open the window/tailgate etc... TOTALLY USELESS..
5,Great Products,"I was very happy with the great selection of products, the speed of delivery, and the quality of the products."
5,emerald ring,"I will order additional items from Gem Avenue, they are very nice and we are very pleased with the ring that I ordered for my mother."
3,Fine ring for the money,"This is not a high-society ring, nor was it selected to be such. It's simple and nice. The gem is smaller, but exactly what I expected. The metal is fine. Not top-of-the-line outstanding, but it's cute and will be fun for a young teenager to wear for a bit. It has a nice style to it."
1,"My dog says ""no""","My dog takes it off the crate, spills water all over his bedding, and then chews it like a chew toy. Then he complains that he is thirsty. This product does us no good. Zephyr-dog and I do not recommend."
1,Worst idea ever,"Was travelling from Germany to the US. Despite reviews, I bought this any way. Two even. One of them the arm holding it broke off before they even got on the plane. The other one was knocked off and ended up being taken off before we landed by airport. Do not buy. Even lazy cats can break them."
4,Engrossing,"Well I went to Canada and figured trying out a Margaret Atwood would be appropriate. This novel reminds me of good John Irving. It combines a healthy amount of plot to keep things moving, along with quirky / interesting characters that remain just normal and developed enough to avoid becoming farcical. Moreover, the narrator is a strong central figure that ties things together and keeps the book focused. Finally, the narrator goes through introspection and change, and Atwood gently guides the reader there via use of a ""story within a story"" that is never overbearing. I know I didn't pick up on all of the symbolism and ""deeper meanings"" of Joan, but I know I enjoyed being along for the ride with her. Very much recommended for the thoughtful reader."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"I didn't get very far with this book, as it is well beyond my level of familiarity. It is very math intensive, and requires a sound foundation in the topic. I'm not too sure I understand why it's called ""Fundamentals of Semiconductors"", I might suggest ""A Very Intense Treatment of Semiconductors"". This is probably a valuable reference for the clever."
1,Methods discribed does not work!,"The method Discribe in this book is ghosting. Contuining where some one else has left off. One, it is very hard to find the information of a suitable canadite, and two if you could, it is not possible to obtain their birth certificate without their ID or the ID of either parent. This is the starting point and all the following steps are not possible without this one."
1,Confusing Book,"I teach an inclusion third grade with about half of my class being special education students. They are having a hard time understanding multiplication and how it works, so I thought this book would be a great visual! I was very, very wrong. I should have listened to the other review on this book. I agree that the art terminology gets confusing with the math explanations. I feel the author could have explained the math in more detail and left out the art all together. I will not even read this book to my class because I know that it will only further confuse them, rather then help them. So this purchase was a waste of my hard earned money that I thought I was putting towards helping my students. Don't make the same mistake!"
4,United 94 (Original Picture Soundtrack),"Very nice track album. Includes all the atmospheric moods as the original score--helps to have seen the movie to appreciate the moods. In either case, a VG++ Score for a very disturbing film: not showy, but very effective."
4,Tribute to the Hot Club Sound,The swing of Macafferi guitars and virtuoso violins take you on an uptempo romp through some of the most well known songs of that era.
2,"""The Glade"" is a swamp of cliches",This detective show combines the usual murder plots (mostly among the very rich) with NCIS-like medical examiner angles. It's been done before 10**6 times. The lead character is an affable chap played by an Aussie with a perfect American accent. Kudos to him for his skill.
1,the glades,"horrible, predictable, and insulting. You can predict the one liners as they come, which is often. The acting is simplistic."
1,Science Process Skills By Richard Rezba,"I would like for you to know that I am very disappointed with your service. I recieved one book that took about a week and a half. But I never recieved the Blue book ""Science Process Skills By Richard Rezba and I am a student that have to share my classmates book. I will not recommend that anyone have to wait like I have done, and I still haven't recieved the book yet. Thank you."
5,"777, All Hell breaks loose!!!","Well what can I say, SUPER!!! Danzig has outdone himself again! Wicked Pussycat is Really Neat! Black Mass is just as good! I am awestruck by this album. Whatever music anyone buys this summer make sure to purchase this one it's awesome!!"
4,"Good Album. Not Best, Not Worst.","I am sick of hearing people say that this album is terrible. Anyone who says that 6:66 is bad should not even be given the time to speak their thoughts. This album is very similar to 6, in my opinion. The only thing that lacks a bit is his band. The instrumentation is not as impressive to me. Glenn's voice and lyrics are very good.Guys, he has changed paths and styles! No big deal! His new style is still awesome! Y'all just need to learn how to bend a little!!!!! Anyone who wants him to go completely back to the old style needs to give that up. Ain't happenin'! He has a brand new style now, which started with 6:66, not 5!!! 6, 7 and 8 obtain his new style. Maybe the albums are not as good as 1-4, but they are very good. Give him a break! This is a good album!"
1,May be OK if you can wire it on your own,"The wiring instructions are wrong. They discuss attaching black wires and yellow wires, when there are no yellow or black wires. After reviewing the included CD, the instructions, and my limited knowlege of electronics, I wired it up and promptly burnt out the transformer. After consultations with a friend with a degree in electronics and a new doorbell transformer, he was able to figure out the wiring on his own and get it working."
5,A have to have in your library!,This book is one that no one should be without! A must read for all those doing self work! A place to truly be in touch with your soul work!
2,Hauntingly Beutuful,"This is another spectacular release by the brilliant green. Angel Song is an awesome retro style song. If you get the chance to see the video for this song, do so. It gives me flashbacks of 80's brat pack teen movie soundtracks, But in a good way. Definitely a good choice for prom music, though I doubt the kids today would go for it. :) X'mas song is a hauntingly beautiful song. The echo effects in this song are amazing, and give unique feel to Christmas :) Awesome harmonizing and melody.Review Edit: I accidentally reviewed this as 2 stars. Sorry :( I can't figure out how to chenage it to 5. :("
4,Reader's Digest Guide to Medical Cures and Treatments,"Apart from giving a thorough yet comprehensible description of each medical condition plus the standard drug treatments, this book also lists for each the various kinds of alternative treatments available, including homeopathy, herbal cures, etc, etc. This kind of enlightenment is rare: most medical guides follow just one line of treatment. I can't recommend this book enough."
4,nice product,"I have only used it once making no knead bread, but the bread turned out really nicely. Would recommend it to others."
2,"So, So","I think it is 5 stars for tomboy women, 0 stars for men, averaging out to 21/2 stars, which rounds off (like the Army does) to 2 stars."
5,Confusing for Texans,"Keen is from the A&M area of Brenham. I'm from Iowa. I gigged with a Houston band last January, including a bar in Brenham.I suggested we do ""Road"" or ""Gringo"" or ""Sonora"" or any of Keen's stuff. The band sneered.Some Texan musicians are just plain jealous of this guy's writing. They should be. This album is a great place to start finding out why."
2,Disappointed,"I asked for a size 6, but this ring turned out to be much larger than a six....ended up giving it away, as it absolutely did not fit...I was very disappointed...pretty ring, but was definitely not the size I ordered."
2,You're not missing anything...,"There is a reason this album is no longer in print. Moby Grape were a great band, but unfortunately that greatness only lasted through their first 2 albums, mostly the first self-titled album. After their 2nd, ""Wow/Grape Jam"", they lost something, somehow.This particlar album, ""20 Granite Creek"" is a throwaway effort. First of all it has NONE of the great ballads that made ""Moby Grape"" so great. But even the rock songs which were so rockin' on that 1st lp are gone from this effort and none of these songs have the same appeal as either of the first 2 albums.If you want a true classic 60's rock album by this band, get ""Moby Grape"", their first one. If you like them a lot and want more, either get ""Wow"" in addition to the 1st, or get the great set ""Vintage Moby Grape"". But that first album is a total winner, every track is great, so I highly recommend that to start with."
3,A fun read. . . but sadly like american cheese,"When I first picked up the book, my first thought was that it resembled the wonderful Series of Unfortunate Events. I decided to try it anyway, though it looked like a pale imiation of Lemony Snicket.In the first book of the series, three siblings left with a single mother arrive at their new home: a battered mansion belonging to an old ""mad"" aunt. Inside, they discover something moving in the walls and creating havoc within the house. With a secret room and a special book, the children find themselves gazing into the world of Faeries.The plot is interesting and the characters have potential, but the length of the book left little room to expand either. Altogether, a fun yet disappointing read; It leaves you wanting more but not giving it. This book is less entertaining than the Series of Unfortunate Events, but it IS more appropriate than the former for younger children."
5,a hit!,"This book was recommended by my son's teacher. He loved it!! As soon as he finished reading it, he asked if we could get the next one!!"
5,Fairies galore,"This is a great start to a fun series. Kids will love to read this book and the others. They are only 100 pages each, with a picture on every other page, to it is great for a first chapter book. They are also wonderful to read aloud to kids. I read them as an adult and loved the entire series."
3,This book is all right .,If you read this book you will like it. You would like this book beacuse its very good.
3,Good but short,"It seems that this book is well written but that the author is getting more money for less product. Length isn't always important with ""great"" literature, I mean look at The Old Man and the Sea, or possibly the Cat in the Hat, both important pieces of lit (in different ways) but both are very short. So what's the difference. How about a complete development of characters, getting your moneys worth etc. If this book had been of a respectable length it would probably be recieving a five today, alas."
5,Loved it!,"My two sons and I loved this book! I teach and am always looking for books that are age appropriate. Harry Potter is high interest, but too difficult for most of my kids. This will give those children what they want at their reading level!!! This series definitely fills the void!"
2,juicer,"Jucier was easy to use, but to go to all that is involved to make one glass of juice was not worth it. Simpler to go to grocery store and get container of 100% juice products."
5,Total Juicing (Plume) by Elaine Lalanne,This is an awesome book that is detailed yet simple.All the information on juicing is here.Mr an Mrs. Lalanne are two wonderful people offering options to becoming heathy and maitaining heath physically mentally emtionally and spiritually.My gratitude to Mrs. Lalanne for wrtting this book and to her husband Mr. Jack Lalanne
3,Apollo: Remeber the past,"Robin Kerrod give us hi perceptive of one of the most important project of the mankind. He Focus his books onthe Moon landing missions, giving us a general view of the Apollo Program. This books is very interesting for the young adults or the people that what to know more of the firs steps of our planet. It came wit a lot of pictures a some interesting facts"
5,A book to be read and reread.,Reynold's beautiful memoir contains memorable characters that many readers will find perched somewhere in their family tree. The prose pleads to be read aloud.
2,nothing new - if you have watched home improvement,I did not find anything new as I had watched all the seasons of home improvement. This would be nice introduction for people to have a feel of Tim's comedy if they are planning to buy home improvement complete seasons set.
4,This guide covers PS2,"This guide covers Playstation 2, PC and Xbox game systems, if you are also a Star Wars Fan this guide has a surprise reward for succesfully achieving all missions"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Yes, Luke, he was your father. That makes the whole sister thing just a little bit on the squicky side, doesn't it?Anyway, we find out Han Solo is still cool, Darth Vader isn't stupid, the Emperor is ugly, and no Ewoks bleed when they die.Throw in some space battles and some force cheese at the end."
2,Not worth it!,"Saw it on TV. The selection of roasters were not as gifted and vibrant as the previous. You would think with the load of media attention that Sheen has been getting, the roasters would land some really good jokes, boy was I wrong! They certainly gave a smile on my face but nothing so funny and so mean that made me laugh so hard till my stomach hurts. with a few of the comedians either dead or not showing up, this show is lame.here is a list of the highly recommended roasts: Flavor Flav, David Hasselhoff, bob sagetOK: William Shatnerworst: Pamela Anderson, denis leary, and charlie sheenIf you must, I recommend you pay for a streaming version of it to sample, then maybe consider buying the DVD. It is $2.99 on this site. I recommend you watch the other ones first, and then you will see where I'm going with this. I went that route- I saw them, and if I liked them I bought it on DVD. I currently own my top 4."
5,Verbal and Visual Art,"Watched this in a Film Review course at Uni and this movie really spoke to me. The nuance with which Andrei speaks is amazing and his ability to turn even the most mundane or silly quirk of a person into an interesting section of the move was surprising. This film attempts to go behind the ""melting pot"" analogy and show that, like Andrei said what holds us together is the understanding of all of our differences. There is far more to it than just a ""lets show people who are difference across the nation"" aspect, and if you pay close attention to the verbal dialogue, especially his small soliloquies you will get far more out of it. I found this movie really interesting and hope all of you do too."
1,Worst Travel Guide Ever,"The most recent edition of this book would be better called the ""approximate"" guide to Spain. Much of the information in this book is simply wrong: maps were upside down (north pointing downwards), accomodations recommended were often dirty or unpleasant or much more expensive than the rough guide said or than alternatives we found on our own, descriptions of things such as the entrances to cathedrals and locations of turists offices were wrong, and often instead of recommending specific places the authors just recommended checking with the local turist offices for accomodations and other information -- making us question what the book was good for anyway. I had a much much better experience with the Lonely Planet guides. Do not buy this book if you are looking for help getting around Spain."
2,If you never read it before-then it will be new to you,I saw this at the book store- glance at it- some new info but mostly the same information he had in his other book- which were good for beginers.
4,Good Information,"the 3-Hour Diet book is an easy book to read and directions are easy to follow. It has helped me in eating properly, not so much in losing weight, just learning to eat the right way and take care of myself"
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this same info from a guest on the Today show. She said her doc told her to eat 8oz of food every 3 hours, no sugary drinks, don't skip an 8 oz meal, and don't tell anyone what you're doing. She followed his advice and lost 242 pounds.You don't need this book. It's just the same info with a bunch of filler and fluff. Invest your money in a food scale instead of his books and get started. :)"
3,"A Redundant ""Low Five""","This would have been ideal as a limited edition DVD packaged with the ""Becoming X"" CD. All the video's are here (Tesko Suicide, 6 Underground, Spin Spin Sugar and Post Modern Sleeze) in all their glorious Kelli (Ali the Tigermouth) Dayton charm. However, there is one strange addition to this DVD compilation. ""Low Five""? is that really Sneaker Pimps? it's not anything I've ever heard from the Becoming X release, although the DVD packaging would indicate otherwise. It would appear that the remaining Pimps are not only trying to make a buck off of the dearly departed Kelli Ali, but also trying to promote the ""Splinter"" CD as well. Basically destroying what would have been appropriate closure to the Kelli Dayton era.olofpalme63"
4,A good dating book for men.,"This is a good book with a lot of good advice.This should have been called:""Dating:a self help guide for men"".You dont have to be a loser to read this book.Got a lot of laughs from it and loved the honesty too.I recommend it to every guy.There are plenty of good books on ""dating"",""picking up girls"",etc on this site."
2,Eh....,"Not bad, but I doubt I'll order it again. It is nice lotion, but I prefer the scent of the Cool Moisture Body Wash, over the lotion, and that's why I bought it, so my lotion would have that same clean fresh scent. Not the case. I dont know why it's not the same as the body wash, but it really isnt."
5,Lady Sings The Blues,I always loved this album as well as the movie. Certain sound tracks just seem to stick with you and this is one.
2,Disappointed,"I like Stanley Baker, I like Alex Cord....I didn't like this picture. I thought it to disjointed and un focused"
3,ADF at its Best,"I bought *Rafi's Revenge* when it first appered and blasted it for weeks on end, and every now and then I still pull it out to listen to *Culture Move* and *Charge*, so it was sweet when I stumbled over this best of.#1,3,5,7,11 and 14 are my favorites. The second CD I haven't even gotten to, but its worth just buying this for the 1st cd anyway. Why? Well, its the sound, which come from all over the place, it sounds a bit like organized anarchy - tablas mixed with Public Enemy beats, with cool Bollywood horn sections, a little jazzy (check #3) and this energy, frenetic, in your face and the rap with the Pakistani/Indian/London inflection is so magically different after listening to M&M; or JZ."
3,This book was too freaky for me!,"This book gave me an eerie feeling about telephone psychics. I for one thought ESP was quite impossible until I read this book,but I still feel the same way about divination. Quite a refrence book to belivers in the sixth sense everywhere!"
1,cheap show item,"meets description with a bit of imagination and stretching - fairly cheap shaft, unwieldy -suitable for hanging on wall with fantasy collection or similar, not real weapons."
4,Entertaining,"This is an informative and entertaining documentary on the life and work of Hunter S. Thompson.Whether you are a fan of his writing, or just curious about the man, this will give you a good overview of the writing and deeds that he has become most famous for.I was already familiar with most of the facts, but enjoyed this anyway for all of the footage of him. It was a treat to get to see him in his prime, and I especially enjoyed seeing all of the stuff from when he ran for Sheriff in Aspen.He was such an interesting guy, I would recommend this to you even if you aren't a fan, and don't have an interest in journalism."
5,Great Documentary,This was a great look into the life of Hunter S. Thompson. A definite buy for a Thompson enthusiast!
1,"Boring at times, easy to put down","If you are looking for a book to take on a vacation where you won't have any problems putting it down for a while, then you have found it! The book's very weak plot is about Lila Mae and her relationship with her four children. The first 2/3 of the book is a long, drawn out story of their trip across country to meet up with Lila Mae's husband & the kids' father in California. She literally drags the children along on a wild goose chase all over the country with no apparent desire to get to their destination. A trip which took her husband three days takes Lila Mae over a month. The second 1/3 of the book is one long chapter about Lila Mae in her old age, skipping around at some of her memories throughout her life, none of which are particularly engaging. I only stuck with this book because I didn't want to leave it unfinished, but had I done so I would not have missed much."
3,Everything There but a Plot,"In many respects, this was a well-written book with a cast of cleverly crafted, interesting characters who set off on a journey from Kentucky to California in the late 50s. They have plenty of adventures along the way, largely due to the spur-of-the-moment decisions of the mother (whose motivation I never actually figured out), but to be honest, there simply was no real plot and no particular direction to the book. I feel this could have been such a good book if only a stronger plot had been constructed."
3,Dreaming for a Better Ending,"The first part of the book was a wonderful read, light-hearted and fun and the Southern accents were perfect. What happened in the second part I will never understand. The tone changes and it seems like a summary or explanation of the beginning which was not needed. The time leap is huge and I wanted to be back on the road in the first half. I suddenly found myself wondering what the point was, where it was going and missing the humor.I would say it's not terrible, but the ending could have been much, much better."
1,Blech,"I bought this book on a whim . . . it was on the best-seller list, I needed something to read, and I thought ""how bad can it be?"" Pretty bad, actually. The characters are annoying and unbelievable, the plot is disjointed, and the story lacks focus. If you're looking for something light and fun, maybe give Marion Keyes a try."
3,A Piece of History,"I'm a fan of Jim Mullen and John Scofield and anything in between. Howard Roberts' playing on this release is technically faultless, but his note choices while soloing, and the material itself, are not my cup of tea. It sounds dated - commercially geared towards a contemporary mass buyer - where stuff like 'Kind of Blue' does not. To a listener of the 21st century, this material sounds somewhat twee. The words 'dirty' and 'funky' have different musical connotations nowadays, and there's nothing dirty or funky here in today's terms. Likely to appeal to the older buyer who likes Chet Atkins and Les Paul. I won't give it a high rating, because I don't really like it, but I won't give it a low rating either, becausee it is excellent in its own way. Howard Roberts' educational material is superb, however, and still groundbreaking and innovative in its approach."
4,A Greatest Hits LP,"When I heard this, I felt like I was listening to someone's Greatest Hits LP. Every track a gem."
2,This makes you appreciate your local roaster,"How shall I put this... Yuck. I guess I'm spoiled by my local roaster. I thought I'd give this a try, at almost half the price of my local guy. In this case, you get what you pay for. Back to what I know, support the small and local. :~{"
1,tasteless and bland,"I got this as a Christmas gift and wow, what a disappointment! If you enjoy a strong, full-bodied coffee, for heaven's sake, get yourself to Starbucks and buy one of their expressos instead of this. The script on the bag was full of hype, none of which added up to high-quality coffee. I'm donating most of the bag to my church, where they will eat anything."
3,decent..better options exist.,I'm not disgusted by this coffee which is often the case. It's not burnt and I'd say that goes a long way towards the rating I'd give anything in this Starbucks flooded market..but what I'm used to is the Backcountry Roasters that you can also find here on Amazon and I'll still attest that that coffee puts all others thus far to shame. do yourself a favor and check them out first.
5,Great Coffee,"I was looking for organically grown, whole bean coffee for my percolator. I'm very happy with this purchase. The coffee is dark and rich, and is very affordable. I will definitely buy this brand again."
2,marketing exercise,"There are cheaper and better written books on the subject. In the last chapter, the author describes his business success, not in trading though, but in selling options software. The whole book is marketing tool for selling his product, with some option basics in between."
4,My daughter loves this toy,"Although the cheese is somewhat small, it is the perfect size for the Haba sized lunch meat and bread. It is very thin felt but is perfect for the bread that has magnets in it because it is easier for the bread to hold everything together. My 3-year-old loves playing with them and making sandwiches for the whole family."
4,Book two just as fun,"The Spiderwick Chronicles continue one afternoon just after school when Simon Grace, while looking for his missing cat at the edge of the yard of the dilapidated estate is dragged into the woods by unseen captors. Jared and Mallory race off in pursuit with a new talisman that allows them to see the fairy creatures they've learned about in the field guide. You'll meet more mythical creatures like trolls, goblins, and hobgoblins (there is a difference) and enjoy more of this clever little tale and Tony DiTerlizzi's wonderful pen and ink drawings. I just wish I'd bought the whole boxed set! I have to wait until pay day to order the next volume; or maybe I should just order them all!"
4,A relatively good book for a new author.,"This book followed the others in the Twilight of the Clans series. The story started out with an exciting, yet unrealistic, attack that a DEST team launched on a Clan outpost. From there, it moves to the planet (the name escapes my mind) where Task Force Serpent (the task force that is to take Huntress, the homeworld of the Smoke Jaguars) is training. The author goes on to describe a few training exercises. Then they leave the Inner Sphere, travelling via a secret route, into the heart of Clan space. A couple of monthes into their long journey, they encounter a few Ghost Bear warships. The battle is very detailed and well written. Soon after, they approach their destination. But all is not well...before they can get there, the crew is halted by the assassination of...Come on, you didn't think I'd give it away, did you? Sorry. You're gonna have to read it for yourself."
4,good,"Quick and easy, Good purchase content is elementary Chinese , And is good for Practical study. The purchase was very easy and convenient."
4,Great addition to your scrapbooking library!,"I'm somewhat of a beginner, but just about ready to move to the intermediate side of the spectrum, and this book seems like a good transition. The pages on display are creative, and fun. Although, there were a few that I don't think I will ever be able to do. The special offer and rulers are also a nice addition.I held out on 5 stars, because I could have used a little more instruction on some of the pages that were displayed. Overall, I higly recommend this book as a great addition to your SB resources."
3,It's okay.. different ideas,"This book is okay. I have several of this type. It is what I call a reference for me book. When I am stuck trying to think of a theme or a different type of layout for my pictures, I go to this type of book. It has some nice layouts, most which would be very time consuming to make. If your looking for different ideas and hours to create a page this is the type of book for you. Some layouts cover two pages and looks like more work, but it depends on how dedicated you are to scrapbooking. If you want new ideas and have plenty of time to work on a layout then you will enjoy this book."
3,This book has held up well with time,"Although this book was published several years ago, I believe it could still be a good guide to a beginner scrapbooker. The photos and layouts are simple but attractive.The book covers the following topics: getting started, the right album, special tools and methods, journaling, designing the page, and theme scrapbooks. Suggestions and directions are clear and easy to understand.Some items are outdated, for example, there is a section on how to store negatives; with digital photography so popular negatives are becoming obsolete! Overall, the book is available used at a very inexpensive price, and that seems well worth it."
1,Is This a Spoof??,"...'cause it sure isn't like anything I have ever read! I purchased it as a spiritual gift for a friend, read it and will give it to her as a joke. There is no connection with the author's severe environmental allergies, her Contract Bridge playing, her foot massages and her connecting everything, except real life with the number 33. I cringed as she ""told her story"",(which, by the way, I never found!) to every celebrity whose path she crossed! Please. If there is a spiritual message here, I am eager to be corrected. As it stands, THE 33 CONNECTION, is not worth 33 seconds of your time, or 33 cents. Boy! Does she have ""other"" connections to have gotten an editor to publish this confusing mish-mash. If I could have, I would have given it zero stars...I am not usually this mean-spirited, but reading the other reviews led me to pay hard -earned money for a gift that won't be given in the spirit with which it was purchased."
2,Works fine if you use it in a location where you won't move the wires.,"I bought this wire for the price. It's cheap and I'm a college student, you see where this is going?So lets get started, this wire works, no doubt about that. But see that problem is the connection does not seem to be very good. It will work for a bit and if all of a suddenly it wouldn't. To get it to work again, I have to move the wire around which is very tedious and annoying when this happens every single time.Now, I'm not sure IF I got a bad wire on arrival because it was the reviews to that led me into buying this wire. Personally, I would recommend to stay away from this wire and buy something from a name brand that may cost more but with that comes proven reliability."
1,It's not standard! It doesn't work!,"Wondering why this is so cheap? Simply because it doesn't work! The audio jack's size is not standard, meaning your sound will be distorted."
3,its ok but faulty,"this cable is long, which is good, but it is very faulty as it appears that it was made with cheap materials (plactic rubber thing, lol) it will work but i would nt recommend it for anyone who constantly has to plug and unplug their headphones into it..."
5,ext cable.,"Great cable.Thick cord, very good quality.Very good and firm click on the jacks. It is not loose.Inexpensive."
1,Stay away.,"Not compatible with iphone headset. if you love your money and dont want to waste it , Stay away from it."
1,Defective cable. Badly distorted sound. I was forced to,Defective item. Badly distorted sound dues to extreme static. I was forced to return it at my expense even though the item was very cheap.
1,Too much noise!,"This cable introduces far to much noise on the line. If you are puchasing this to extend any sort of mic, forget about it."
2,Almost worth the price.,"I'm not even sure it made it to the two-week mark, but one side went out. If I connect my headphones just so - not completely in - then I get sound in left and right, but at a lower sound level. But it was a $3 purchase, so I guess I got what I paid for."
2,not good,"its one of the cables were if you move it around the music only comes out of one speaker, they might not all be like that but mine is very difficult to get to work right."
1,Terrible sound quality,The sound quality of this thing is HORRIBLE. The volume just fades in and out without warning. Everything I listen to just sounds so tinny and muddled. WOULD NEVER EVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
5,Robert Earl Keen,"No 2 Live Dinner is incredible. It is what you can expect at every Robert Earl Keen show. From the beginning, ""I'm Going To Town"", to ""I'm Comin' Home"", it makes you wish you were there. My personal favorites are ""Merry Christmas From The Family"" and ""The Road Goes On Forever"". ""The Road Intro"" is a nice set-up for the song. Purchase and enjoy."
5,Love it,"I heard ""Merry Christmas from the Family"" on the radio and had to search hard to find the album it came from. I'm glad I did. This is great folk music, sort of John Prine on uppers. I enjoy all the tracks."
5,"Awesome, must have, Texas attitude with a splash of beer!!","Seeing Robert Earl Keen in concert is the only thing better than this album. I first heard of Robert on the John Boy and Billy Show as have followed his fanatical band since.. A must have album that takes you from party atmosphere to outlaw to long lost loving feeling. This album has more mood changes than a 16 girl on her first date. If you buy one album, you gots to get this.. Amarillo Highway, Gringo Honeymoon, 5 Lb. Bass, and Road goes on forever ""live"" don't hold a candle to studio version. Don't miss out on this you'll regret it....Duck and Rich are all that and a bag of chips'."
5,great book,"Great book. I recomend it to anyone. A story is told through and old man who fishes on the sea and conflicts happen, but the story is metaphorical. The old man represents Hemingway and his life. It is told in that sence. Ages 14 and up!"
5,It's great!,I have multiple sclerosis and heat really bothers me. When I wear this around my neck I seldom have problems with the heat.
1,Wrong product,"the product I received was a different brand and instead of 180 cablets, I received only 150!not satisfied at all!"
1,Honeywell HE260A Whole House Humidifier,"We had to get a new furnace and whole house humidifier following Hurricane Sandy. Humidifiers were hard to come by, so we took a chance on the Honeywell HE260A. Two returns later, it finally got installed. Don't like it, but we're stuck with it. Holes are already cut out in ducts. Unit is too big (at least for us), water doesn't recycle back, so a complete waste of water; the bypass duct is huge and not flexible; instructions are awful; you have to buy a separate kit to get the instructions on a CD, can't really tell much difference in the humidity in the house. Unfortunately, the one we had before isn't available any more."
4,Warm House Now,"My RH is 52% now, My old smaller one only achieved RH 36%.I am concerned about the amount of water drain off, it seems to me, like a lot of waste!!Jennifer"
2,Instant Systems,"Interesting and somewhat useful, but not very good. More a generic rehash of already-known factors, and not put together or targeted very well."
4,Great Book for Small Business Owners,"Instant Systems is a solid addition to any small business owner's collection. As we say in the small business marketing world ""Marketing is not a mystery, it is a system."" Instant systems is an easy read with simple to follow advice for setting your small business onto the road to success."
1,"My own fault, I guess....","Perhaps it said so clearly, but I didn't happen to notice that this paper is VERY VERY thin, as compared to the other ""flavors"" of Canon paper, which comes in packs of 10, 15, or 20 sheets. For my purposes, paper this thin (even if it prints well, which this does) is completely useless."
4,UNKNOWN TRUTHS,"THIS BOOK,LIKE VERY FEW LIKE IT SHOWS HOW SITUATIONS CAN AND DO GET OUT OF HAND. WAR IS HELL,AND OUR PEOPLE SUFFERD MORE ,MUCH MORE THEN MOST,BUT PEOPLE SOMETIMES WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING IN WHAT THEY THINK IS THE RIGHT CAUSE.THERE IS MUCH BLAME TO GO AROUND IN THE HISTORYOF WW TWO,AND IT SHOULD BE TOLD AND LEARNED FROM. HOWARD MALLINGER SUNRISE FL."
1,terrible,I never received this product and didn't receive the note that I would be getting it until some time after I ordered.
1,This isn't the game.,"Just a warning for all the folks out there that might be snapping this one up, this does not include the game. This is just a little lightsabre that was given out to people who preordered. I don't know why Amazon is selling it separately, but nothing here seems to make quite that distinction (which my family found out the hard way)."
3,Pretty Fun...... If you're 6 years old,"It really depends on what your age is for this one. It's for anyone who likes to play pretend, in other words, ages 3-6. It's like a better version of those light up ones. Anyway, its a great gift for a child, but anyone else should steer clear of this one."
1,knights of the old republic,"As a big Star Wars fan ,I went out and got xbox just for this game.As far as a Star wars game this is the worst game,you make all the decisions on what to do, and the game acts it out. This is not a first person shooter.AS far as Star Wars fans go don't bother this game stinks"
5,Checkers,"I have used this oil in my 05 Roadking, my 07 E/glide and now in my 2011 Heritage Classic. I use this in all 3 ""boxes"" It shifts well and quiets motor down and runs cooler. I have used ""dino"" oil and Amsoil, this is my choice for performance. Price on Amazon fair and shipped to my door in a timely fashion, also K&N oil filters avail here, chrome twin cam is 171C, top quality filter and has a nut on the end to wrench off with a socket, no filter wrench needed"
1,Poor Quality from HP - Compaq is gone!,"The NC4000 with the advanced port replicator or the standard port replicator is the poorest quality setup Compaq / HP has ever produced. HP decided to produce a ""one size fits all"" port replicators. The Advanced Port Repluicator is 1 1/2 times the size of the notebook and the rail that is supposed to protect the back of the laptop blocks the USB port needed to connect the external USB bay (the external unit requires power from the sister port to the USB port).The notebook used as a stand alone unit is OK at best. I purchased this to replace the Compaq EVO N200 with port replicator and am sadly disappointed. I have returned all but the opened one that HP will not accept back.I feel this is just a sign of things to come - Compaq quality is now being replaced with HP's inferior quality."
1,I threw up after eating these bars,"I had no problem eating these bars, they tasted ok, and I thought, wow, what a nice addition to my raw diet.However, about 2 hours later, my stomach got real queasy andI threw up (several times).. Not a great experience.I returned the bars, however, after all postage fees, etc,I was only refunded 12 dollars on a $28 total order.So Buyer beware!!!!"
4,HEALTHY AND DELICIOUS,MY DOCTOR WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE READ THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS SAYING IT WAS THE FIRST SO=CALLED NUTRITION BAR THAT HE'D SEEN THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU.
5,Raw Revolution 'Chocolate & Cashew' bar,"The Raw Revolution 'Chocolate & Cashew' bars are very good, with a deep chocolate flavor not typically found in 'health food' and/or 'energy' bars. Plus the Raw Revolution bars have just the right amount of sweetness. The Raisin, Raspberry, and Coconut chocolate flavored Raw Revolution bars are also excellent!"
4,LOVE THE LOX'S (((WILD OUT)))!,the lox's album express different parts of life and feelings.that's what make their album real.
4,Definetly interesting,"Wild Out!The new album is better then the first, and definetly mad as hell and waste a bit too much time taking hits at a man who can't compete with them anyway, lets not even mention names since they arent alowed to.(by contract) But its definetly interesting, Phat ruff Ryder CD. No more shiny suits"

4,A homeric effort,"Kindle beats all other formats for a collection of works that I like to dip into for reference or re-read sections, but sure wouldn't want to carry around on paper continually."
4,A little scratchy.,"This product is nice and product description is accurate. However, it's a little scratchy. I used sand paper to file down the rough spots, and that fixed the problem. I don't know how the rough spots could be avoided in production. I assume it came out of a mold that way."
3,"Oh, dear","First Ashford and Simpson produced and arranged tracks for a Diana-Marvin album. Only a few of those vocals were ever laid down and one made the final album. Other producers came on board and more was recorded but Diana and Marvin only sang at one session together. The rest was recorded separately and the album sounds like it. Mucho mechanical, not very passionate, one great single, ""You're A Special Part of Me"" (fake Ashford-Simpson). ""Don't Knock My Love"" on the album is not the same version as used on the single. These two were barely on speaking terms when this project was put together. They were barely on singing terms either."
3,"Very, very truncated.","The scores of Victor Herbert's ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""The Red Mill"" are lovely classics, but the incomplete scores represented by this Decca Broadway remastering of its antiquated 78s are not the best reprentation. My advice: wait for the John McGlinn ""Babes in Toyland"" to be released. As for ""The Red Mill"", you'd do better to pick up the Ohio Light Opera's double-CD from Albany Records."
3,incomplete pleasure,"Two terrible mistakes keep this from 5 stars.. BABES IN TOYLAND is not complete as they are missing the delightful IN THE TOYMAKER'S WORKSHOP. Why? In THE RED MILL they use a butchered take of EVERY DAY IS LADIES DAY WITH ME. Again, why?John McGlinn will be out with a complete BABES soon - and there is a lot of music in it - so you may want to wait."
4,Finally available on CD!,"Decca's 1946 album of selections from Victor Herbert's celebrated musical was a welcome addition to record libraries, covering most of the major songs plus some of the delightful dance music. The album was reissued as a ten-inch Lp in 1949. A later reissue in 1957 dropped 4 songs to fit the score on one side of a twelve-inch Lp backed by six selections from Herbert's THE RED MILL. That pairing is reproduced here but the CD contains the complete BABES IN TOYLAND program! It's nice to have it back too! Nice of Decca to give us this early Christmas present this year. But BABES IN TOYLAND is a score that enchants all year round. How strange that no other complete recording exists.The six selections form THE RED MILL offer a nice bonus, and the selections are well sung."
1,Shang O Bloody Lang,"Goodness graciouse me I really have to add to this debate.This group was really bad, but the 5-10 year old girls liked em. The only half decent single they did was I only want to be with you. I rememember all the 5-10 year old teeny boppers wearing thier T shirts with a star on them like Woody was wearing.The group never even played thier own instruments at the start except for the old fart from the original line up.This was probably one of the worst bunch of posers ever to record a tune. At least the monkeys made some great songs, these boys just produced sickly garbage. I'm off for me Vindaloo and popadoms, tara."
2,Yesterday's Heroes,"""Saturday Night"" turned into Sunday morning rather rapidly for these plaid lads from Tartania following their American debut on Howard Cosell's ""Saturday Night"" TV show. Save for a few further Top 40 entries (most notable being ""I Only Want To Be With You"") on the US charts, the Bay City Rollers soon found themselves on Saturday morning TV (shades of the Monkees!), and it wasn't too long before the Bay City Rollers were a distant memory in the cut-out bins. Buffered by exceptional sound, and the presence of single versions, ""Definitive Collection"" comes about as close as most stateside fans would want to get to a 70's UK fad that had crested well before ""Saturday Night."""
5,100.00 ??? Super Value / Steinberg has a lot of experience,"Hello Musicfriends, I worked with Steinberg software since the mid 90's and never had a problem ever. Currently I own Cubase LE and SE (LE is a free version that comes with Tascam1804 bundle) and its great. I love it, I have zero freeze ups and my G4 Mac is old, record quality vocals or broadcast with my MXL63V Mic, crispy as ever, draw in fade outs, midi controls, color customise your tabs, full notation, eq's, effects and much more.... The learning curve can be steep, it was hard for me, but look whats packed in this software.... you have to learn! But its worth it: Think 48 track studio - 16+Midi channels - soundcollection - Labtop!!!I don't think you can go wrong for a 100.00!!! Reason? Ableton? ProLogic anyone? I believe its a grand.---- btw check GuitarCenter or MusiciansFriend for their excellent ratings if you want to be sure!!!"
1,void of quality,"it's hard to write good poetry, as the form of poetry lends itself to self-indulgence and excess. this dreadful collection is a perfect example of that and to call it an expression of the black experience is an insult to all my sisters and brothers."
3,"Disappointed So Far, But It May Be Me","Maybe it's just me, because I do have a hard time finding comfortable shoes, but I was disappointed in these. While the first few steps feel heavenly--the sole is so soft it positively bounces--the padding on the inside is SO thick that my toes painfully hyperextended after about a half-hour of walking. Now I'm stuck with them and not sure I can wear them. Not sure what to say except that if you have sensitive feet, test these around the house before committing to them outside."
1,waste of money,I live in NY and i purchased this because i was upgrading my stock radio... i could have my own radio tower attached to the roof of my car and still would not be able to get a clear station... buyer beware... i would just go ahead and install a new antenna wire if you dare... or have a professional do it for you...
1,Adam and Eve Sindrom,"I can't review the book as it was never received, but my Visa account was charged. I have been trying to contact you to no avail until today...I found your address and will be asking you to credit my account the amount you charged.Bertha Dennis"
3,Not For My Pet,"Unfortunately, my pet does not like the product. I believe its a good product with good nutritional value, however, my dog does not like it and will pass on this one."
2,Unhappy Camper here,"There is no indication of what book and chapter you're reading. You Version has the book name centered at the top of the screen so you always know where you are, but since it doesn't allow download of the NIV for use without Wi-Fi, I purchased the Life Application Study Bible. I'm sorely disappointed and wish I had examined the sample more thoroughly."
5,Great resource!,"This Life Application Bible brings God's Word to another level. Let's face it, we've all hit those moments where we wonder what the Bible's trying to say....this resource is perfect for those moments."
3,Not easy to use for Bible Study,I have owned two leather bound Life Application Study Bibles over the years. Wore out the first one teaching Sunday School. The Kindle version is slow to load and is not easy to use for study unless you are simply wanting to read it like a book. I was expecting it to respond more like Bible Apps that I use on my phone.
3,More updated versions are now available,"This is the original Life Application Bible. The study notes were completely updated a couple of years ago and newer editions are available. I also prefer New Living Translation (2nd edition, published in 2005) than NIV (last updated in 1984). If you have to use NIV, buy NIV Faith in Action Study Bible instead of this one."
1,Don't expect a genuine leather bible,When I saw this bible I thought it was such a great price for genuine leather. Instead I received bonded leather a cheap alternative to genuine leather. I notified amazon about the problem and got an rma. A few days later I received exactly the same thing. Very disappointing.
4,NIV Bible,"I had to replace the bible I was using, which was my husband's leather NKJ version. It was chewed up by our new puppy. I was looking for a bible that would be an easy read and this one seems to fit the bill. I do wish the print was bigger."
2,NIV Life Application Study Bible,Several pages were not cut properly and so far I have found one page where there is a typing error and there is a complete sentence missing.
5,Life Changing,I am so committed to my daily Bible study now. Life Appplication brings Gods Words to life for me. I feel so much closer to my Lord and Saviour because of this Study Guide.
4,'Study to show thyself approved...',"The Life Application Study Bible NIV is fantastic! I love this bible! I have many bibles but the interpretation is presented in the simplest form. I purchased copies for my family. The only complaints that I have is that the print is really small, so if you have troubles reading small print or do not have good lighting it may be a challenge. The other complaint is that Jesus' words are not in red. Other than that, it's a winner. Love it!"
4,"Not bad, but I prefer the standard Study Bible version","I like the Life Application version slightly less than the plain Study Bible version of the NIV, but it is still a really good version. I have one of these on my shelf, but because of it's bulk and less focused footnotes I prefer the other version. This is a great bedside Bible, or one to keep around the house for reading. I have given a number of these as gifts, and they are a nice Bible for new believers, or for those who are finally getting around to growing in their faith."
2,Too small,"I had to go out and buy a magnifying page cover to be able to read the text. It became such a hassle, that I just gave up and went by to my larger, hardcover version. Wasted money."
2,The bible did not have the red print.,The bible did not have the red print like it said it would. It is a helpful bible for learning.
2,Life Application Study Bible,"The words in the book are so small, I have to use a magnifying glass. While the scripture is very clear, it is too hard to read the bottom portion which is the part I wanted to use."
5,Life Application Study NIV Bible,I have found it to be easy to use and find the guidance notes and background information to be very informative and interesting. It has broadened and strengthened my faith.
4,Much easier to read than the Hard Cover.,"I've owned and enjoyed the hard cover version for years, but needed larger font to read the small print. The interpretations of Revelation are insightful."
5,Reading the Bible easy...,I Love This bible it's like having an encyclopidia of knowledge at your finger tips. I gave this bible to a friend and she loves it.
5,bible,"This is a nice bible. Great price, but kind of small print. Gave it as a Christmas gift and hopefully it will be used to build up a life in God and the Holy Spirit and Jesus."
4,Seriously,This is a good rendition of the bible however a understanding text would be good to accompany it
2,I didn't buy it.,"I've never really been a fan of The Bible, and The Student NIV is no exception. I really can't fathom what makes it such a great literary work when it has a lacking plot, indecipherable narratives, bad POV changes, and a terribly disconnected ending. I mean, New Jerusalem? Who would buy that? And doesn't one find the idea of streets paved with gold to be outdated? Another thing, the switch from the Jews to the Christians is a bit murky. I can't see one guy (albeit a cool dude like J) coming to save the world from an end that the world can save itself from.Isn't the Bible just a bad mythological misconception of historical occurances around Macedonia in 4000 B.C.? I'm amazed that such a large cult following has developed from the very idea! Perhaps one shouldn't be so sloppy in choosing a cult (remember Jonestown,) but Christianity could really use a better book.I, for one, wasn't impressed."
2,DARK HIGHLIGHTER,"It was written that this Bible had no markings other than owner's name on the cover.I wish that was true. I was able to remove that but the dark green highlighter used in numerous places... well, that is that. The Bible itself is good it's just highlighted ugly."
5,perfect size,"I gave this book to a friend after having enjoyed the one my mother gave me for many years. I always loved the study section at the bottom of the page that sometimes had different explanations from different sources. I also liked the beginning of each book of the Bible where it broke down the book into the major thoughts/developments within. The friend to whom I gave the book wrote me a thank-you note that said,""I read it everyday. It's so great - with the part at the bottom of each page where I can really focus on each verse. It's precisely what I wanted and I love it."" The size of this personal size version is very convenient and lighter weight than the original."
5,Life Application,This Bible is the best way I have found to learn and absorb all of Gods word. I feel as though I am understanding his word and following Christs path. The Best Money I could spend outside of my weekly offering.
4,This Bible would encourage study of the Word.,I found the Life Application Study Bible to be very clear and informative.it gave very revelent background information to the verses concerned and it also gave a detailed explanation almost verse by verse. I study at college and would recommend this Bible to any student for its clarity and detail.
1,LMAO,"They made a BRATZ book about....friendship? Gosh this is hilarious. Bratz act like the kind of people who pick on people who don't wear ""what's in"""
4,Student Solutions Manual for Miller & Freund's Probability and Statistics for Engineers,"The book is helpful, but I did not realize it only has answers to the odd problems. That was disappointing.I would have liked to have known that before purchasing. Most answer manuals have answers to all problems."
2,Not a bad first time,The instructions were simple and it was promptly delivered but the quality of the henna was very poor and gritty. I had trouble getting it out of my hair. The results were minimalI my dark brown hair had slightly copper tones. Later I tried it again with some body art quality henna mixed with lemon juice instead of hot water and liked it much better. It was cheaper as well but I wouldn't put it down for someone cautious for their first time.
5,will buy again,i will buy this henna again! So glad that i finally found a decent product here in the USA!
1,Ugh,This is a horrible cassette adapter. I hate it and it only worked for a week maybe even less than that! Save your money!
1,Too Quiet,I have to crank the stereo half way up just to even be able to hear it. My old cheap one was better than this.
3,Dakar where??,"The pictures were all in black and white,i would have liked to have seen more shots of the Dakar,if you are looking for pictures of the Jeepster concept you will find plenty here.Jeep nuts will like this book if you like archives also."
4,"Give Terry His Due, Boys.","If Terry Allen has recorded any substandard music, he's been kind enough not to release it ... Lubbock is another winner from argulably one of the most consistent musicians on the scene today ... If you listen to Joe Ely, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Lyle, Robert Earl Keen, then you'll definitely enjoy this recording ... A final recommendation: Some reviewers have lamented musicians such as TA can't get on the radio nowadays ... Well, I can't solve the underlying problem when profitability comes before quality but I will encourage you give KPIG (Freedom, CA) a listen ... They play it all ... Online at KPIG.com or if you're ever in the Monterey-Santa Cruz area, turn the dial to 107 oink 5 on your FM dial (their tag line, not mine) ... It'll take you back to when radio wasn't a wasteland of commercials and noise, when you actually used the tuner attatched to your amp ... enjoy and buy Lubbock ... we need to support these musicians to ensure quality remains, however obscure ..."
3,Decent,The Undercard wasn't as good as it could have been but the TagTitle match was awesome.Another good bout was Ron Simmonsdefending the World Title against the Barbarian.Sting tried hisbest but he couldn't Carry Jake Roberts.
3,Laptop Keeps Falling Off,"Something no one has mentioned yet, my MacBook laptop slides off this pad all the time! I've had it a few weeks and my computer probably slides off almost every day. I try to be careful and keep it steady, but the minute I turn my back, I hear it crash to the floor.The product does keep my laptop cool (the fan never gets loud anymore) so I like it, but it will probably also be the demise of my laptop. Just be careful!"
4,great,This little lap desk works like a charm and it looks great too. We liked it so much we ordered another one.
4,Handy on the couch,"Works well to keep your laptop in an acceptable position when used on the couch so it doesn't slide, block the vents, or potentially damage the power cord. Also works well on your lap if your laptop gets too hot."
3,Cushy,"This item is great for the lap if you are laying in bed and using your laptop, but it is a little bulky. You are able to fit the power cord and your mouse in the middle section when you aren't using laptop. If you are looking for something that keeps your legs from getting hot from the laptop then its great. However it isn't as good for cooling it heats up just the same for when you are using laptop on a desk or your lap.This is a great replacement for pillows if you are using it for leverage, but if your laptop tends to run hot it will still do so, you may want to look into getting a cooling fan for it instead."
3,Notebook Stand - Fair,Couldn't find what I wanted in major computer type stores in my area for Christmas so ordered this laptop desk and it is kind of bulky and doesn't sit on your lap real square. Great if your laptop is on a table but didn't care for it when your computer sits on your lap.
3,Great if you're tummy isn't in the way lol,"So I am only giving it 3 stars because, wellll, if you're overweight and have a round stomach, it sucks. :p Soooooooo, clearly I need to keep loosing weight, maybe another 10lbs or so, lol."
5,"For 15"" laptops, I'd say no more no less","I have a 2010 MBP. The cushion is good. It's light.The one issue that makes the laptop cushion flawed is that your legs have to be together for it to sit perfectly atop your thighs. Guys, like me, like to spread our legs a little and chill. It still works, but edges come up to the highest part of your thighs, no longer. However, if your legs are a little closer, which is comfortable, it's just right.Can't complain (anymore than I just have :-)I like the height, AND the surface texture. It's subtly grippy, but not really. Still, there's enough traction somehow so the laptop won't easily slide off. It's also attractive - I got the brown and... something one."
4,Love this for working on the couch,This was just what I needed for days when I do all my work on the couch. Keeps my lap and the computer cool and is at a nice ergonomic angle.
5,Great computer heat saver,We had one of these already and liked it so much we bought a 2nd for our son. It is easy to use and doesn't have the fans that you have to plug in but still keeps the laptop from overheating.
3,LoNoiz .105 Spiral Twist Weedeater Line,"I was looking for a trimmer line that would spin fast with an older/smaller commercial trimmer. I had used a .95 blue twist line in the past that was excellent. Unfortunately, the US distributors are out of business and I can't find it anywhere. I read the reviews saying that the .95 LoNoiz was too flimsy for a commercial trimmer, so I decided to try the .105. The spiral twist seems more like a gimmick to me because the spiral doesn't have much of an indention & the line is pretty thick for a .105 & my old trimmer labors with it. I should have stuck with the .95 inch or even less with this particular line. It does seem relatively durable and strong. Would probably be good with a 26 cc newer, more powerful trimmer."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"Wow!!!! is a very good statement, This stuff rocks... I moved up from .095 to this .105 and its great last three times the .095 stuff I was using and even loads in the spool nice. I've used the .130 before and its so stiff that its almost imposable to load in the spool.GET SOME OF THIS...EXCELLENT PRICE AS WELL."
4,K&N Filter for the xA,"Fit was perfect and it's a simple drop-in. No need to replace air filters, just clean and oil this and you're set."
5,Best Buy Sonicare use rechargable batteries work great,"We first bought this brush in March 2007. We are now replacing it with the same today Sept 15, 2011 four years later. I have had this brush using rechargable sony or radioshake batteries for the last 4 years. The charge holds for at least two weeks. The brush works great. My wife is a perfectionist and loves this brush. We did have the higher price rechargable sonicare, but they died in two years. Today 4 years later my wife's sonicare did not turn on. I think it is a dead switch. This is a great product. We had minimal problems with leaking. This less costly item works as well as the more costly rechargable sonicare. I like the convenience and cost savings of using rechargable batteries. The brush is good for about a year."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Like Wasting $,Honestly...the brush cleans great - best brush I have ever had with a toothbrush...and after a couple of weeks I have noticeably whiter teeth and healthier gums....which is great...BUT....the thing needs new batteries EVERY 2-3 DAYS. Who can afford to spend $ on batteries every week? Its ridiculous...save yourself $ and frustration and opt for the Elite series...trust me.
2,Broken Item,"Removed brush assembly from the body and am unable to get it back on. I can not tell if it is broken or not, but it will not screw back on."
5,Love my Sonicare,"I absolutely love this Sonicare toothbrush. I keep it in my toiletries bag for travel. At home, I use a rechargable model."
5,Solid,Well built cables. Was looking for white Cat6 and these fit the bill.Bought another cable at 5ft. Would buy again.
5,A Great Coffee Table Book!!!,"Every right hand page has a great photograph of a different rabbi complemented by an insightful biography on the facing page. Their stories are interesting as the rabbis run the gamut from Chasidim to converts from other religions, from learned men and women who have devoted their entire lives to religion to a hippie just off a commune. No matter what your faith, this book will hold your interest.The one-rabbi-to-a-page format makes for a wonderful book for coffee table browsers."
1,Junk... Burned out in less than 6 months,"Bulbs were nice and bright when they were working. Now less than six months of run time, one of the bulbs has burnt out..."
2,OK but has flaws,"My Grandkids like the basketball game but it tips over too easily with waves in pool from their activity. Will have to try and add more floatation to see if it will work better. A big negative. Also, the ""Cool Jam"" that was pasted on front of backboard was falling off when arrived. Have tried to glue it back on but may be better taken off."
3,All Right,This game is like a looney version of Metroid. You get great guns! I would not give this game to a little kid though it has some green blood on it on some levels.
3,Disappointed,"Not sure when I ordered but some of the photos in the advertising showed a bottle with the filter. But, there was no bottle included with the purchase. For the price of the filter I don't think a simple bottle would be too much to ask for."
1,when I order new I expect NEW,The package was torn and opened before It got to me. also some parts were missing. When I order a product NEW I expect NEW. I don't appreciate returning an item because someone has pawed over it before me.
2,Poor water,"Bought this for a hiking trip coming up. I took it with me for a weekend hike to try it out. The pump was very smooth and efficient. However, the water that came out was gross. I tried 3 different types of water, and all turned out very poor. I as very disappointed especially being as the pump itself was by far the smoothest and easiest I have used. I sent back and got the MSR. It isn't nearly as easy, it's actually very strenuous to use, but the water tuned out great! Maybe mine was defective, I would try again if time wasn't an issue."
5,Excellent Set,"This is an excellent set. Its a great price for 26 funny epsisodes. The quality is nice and the DVD menu is cool. If your looking for all of the MTV segments than you won't find them on this set, though many of these bits were aired on MTV."
3,DVD's from the first season not working,"Overall, I was really excited when I received the two seasons. The dvd's were wrapped but when I put in the first DVD to play - the disk would not play. I've tried it in a dvd player separately and in the computer. I was rather disappointed and don't know what to do. I am able to play the other disks in the set."
2,wish it was better,"I was excited to get this organic cat nip for my new cat and my old cat that has never really cared for the nip. The old cat did sniff and lick a little bit of it up, but lost interest and never acted strangely. The new cat sniffed once and had no interest in it at all. Maybe this is good cat nip for another cat but it didn't affect mine at all. =("
2,This catnip does absolutely nothing for my cat.,The product arrived nicely packaged. It also has a nice scent. However - my cat doesn't seem to like or dislike it. The catnip has no effect on her whatsoever.
4,My three male cats LOVE CATNIP,"This is a smallish can with fluffy catnip that seems to be pretty potent. Judging from my uptight Siamese rolling around on the floor, I give this four stars. Be careful opening up the can. The stuff is in a plastic baggy with a twist tie. You will want to keep the stuff in the plastic bag until at least its half gone. You really need to pack it back in the can carefully the first few uses. A little pricey for the amount, it is still good stuff, gift worthy for the tin as it can be reused.Sojos Certified Organic Catnip"
3,It's okay,"It's okay catnip, but I have gotten better. How do I know? By the way my cats react to the nip. This nip they just fall asleep on, no playing no rolling just zzzzzzzzz. This other stuff I got, Bellrock growers catnip buds, they go bonkers on! The other thing I don't like is this stuff has a lot of stalks in it. It just seems like the stuff you get at Walmart. I don't think I will purchase this product again."
4,Well documented but a little harsh,"I started this book with a lot of prejudice pro Castro. The book tears him down to human and often small proportions. It is difficult to argue against a book that is so well documented, but I have the feeling the author has a problem to get rid of his negative prejudice. He keeps the scientific standards in mind though, so I don't mind. It gives me the opportunity to be objective about Castro and his revolution. And that is not easy with such a controversial figure. Disturbing was that sometimes I couldn't see the difference between quotation and opinion of the author. There are also some superfluous details.In the end I can't follow the author in his negative prejudice. I can only conclude, that the Americans treated the Cubans and Castro in a very stupid, if not shameful, way. He deserved much more support than many other dictators that were strongly supported by the U.S."
5,Fantastic sharpness and great handle,Most paring knives have poor handles. This one has a great handle and the blade is very sharp. I have been using it to prep my pealed tomatoes and it goes through them like butter and I don't have to be concerned with cleaning it up right away as the surface is non reactive.
2,Iris lovers...save your money!!,"Wow, how disappointing. I am a grower/lover of bearded irises and automatically purchase any newly published book on the subject. This book is just set up poorly to read, the varieties depicted are from the author's garden(I assume) are bland, boring, and non representative of some of the finest varieties of bearded irises out there. I really didn't appreciate most of the photography either...a lot of that artsy ""looking into the center of the flower"" stuff. The only reason it got even two stars is that I appreciate the author's text in some areas and that she's endeavored to create a book to showcase and promote the iris. Unfortunately, the overall effort seems to fall short."
2,"Comfy, but Too Quiet","Pros: comfortable, compact, lightweight and comes in an attractive and useful storage pouch.Cons: people on the other end hear loads of ambient noise, and even at the loudest setting, I can barely hear the call.I like the idea of this headset, but I am returning it. It just wasn't loud enough.There appear to be some sound quality and volume issues that Body Glove needs to work on. It is possible that the low volume problem is related to my phone, the LG L1400.If you buy this headset, make sure that you get it from a retailer that has a good return policy. I bought mine from Best Buy, so I will be stopping by after work to exchange it for a different headset."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this before my first trip with my two cats being placed in the belly of the aircraft on a trip to Florida. First of all, Delta puts their own stickers all over the kennel, so you don't need the Live Animal Stickers. The food/water trays are useless, and the paper I could have got from a brown paper bag from the grocery store. I wasted my money on this one."
4,Convenient means for replacing travel kennel bowls,"When I recently moved, I needed these replacement bowls for my pet's kennel. Ordering them from Amazon was SO convenient and the price was about what I would have paid in a brick and mortar store (without the extra trip).These were identical bowls to the ones sold with travel pet kennels."
1,Not worth it,"Even though this product is cheap, it's a little much for a piece of cardboard and two plastic mini bowls."
1,Beware,"This item is inferior quality. Items are ""hand painted""... however inappropriately. The item I received depicted a couple of barrels (not what I ordered) and one had some sort of chinese (really) words painted on and the other was labeled ""engine oil."" Not what I wanted as a gift with wine. I guess you really do get what you pay for! Now the seller wants me to pay for return. Bad deal!"
2,Doesnt work as well as expected,It doesnt absorb sounds as well as some of the other stuff out there. It hasnt really blocked that much because the sounds just reflect off of it easily.
5,"There, I Said It Is Great Music","""Coming of age"" is usually reserved for kids who realize that Mom and Dad aren't an unlimited ATM. However, in this case, it refers to someone realizing the limits in life and coming to grips with them. This album takes that realization and bares it to all the world. Alpha Male & The Canine Mystery Blood is a humorous look at our changing priorities. At the other end of the spectrum is Nice Day, the poignant look at what truly makes life worth living. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and in the end you will know a little bit more about yourself and why you laugh and cry."
2,belongs in the shadow,"okay, the stories here are not driven by plots, but more by images, to put it that way. the writing style is simple, though some of the descriptions had some interest because they were uncommon similarities, etc. but there is too little going on. but most of all the problem was the way the story was written.-""yes"" she says. she walks. the streets are emty.very simple stuff like that. and i never cared for what the story was about, being practically nothing at times."
5,Great upbeat listen!,By listening to this CD of the Shamen's greatest hits you wonder how they never achieved huge status in the US. I love listening to this CD while in the car - it really elevates you.I recommend this cd as well as En-Tact.
5,Dirty and Mean with good guitar work,"The whole album has that old southern blues rock grind, but it doesn't lose the Ray Wylie effect. Good guitar work throughout the entire album. As most of Ray Wylie's songs they are songs of blood, sweat and grease with a touch of sin and redemption. He and Gurf Morlix really sound like they are having fun playing together and that always makes an album special to me."
4,superb and greasy on the ear.,"this is what early zz top would have sounded like had they leaned toward alt-country rather than rock. mr hubbard plays superb electric guitar and is a fine songwriter to boot. down and dirty, gritty and greasy, blues and country and rock & roll. choosen as one of the 50 best albums of 2006 by no depression magazine, i recommend this to swamp-rockers everywhere."
2,Not for a Novice!,"The product description gave me the assumption that I would learn how to make web-layouts and buttons from scratch. So I ordered the book. When it arrived I sat on the couch with the book in my hands, thumbed through it and got dissapointed by the minute. It teaches you how to add objects to prefab stuff. That's not the way I want to learn things. I want to learn how to make things from scratch.When you know how to make lay-outs and so on in Photoshop, this book may give you additional info. When you are a Novice and want to learn how to make everything by your self this book is a waste of money."
1,cheaply made,The table started coming apart shortly after we put it in the pool. Both of the plastic pieces that hold the net broke very easily. We were never able to really use it because it didn't hold up long enough.
2,Only skims the surface...,"I'm planning on re-siding my own house, and I was looking for a comprehensive guide to help me through the process. This book brushes over the basics of siding and roofing, touching on the choices available and the different tools and accessories that are used in the process, but it fails to provide the step-by-step guidance that I was hoping for. If you're looking for a comprehensive reference, look elsewhere. A better title would have been ""The Basics of Roofs and Sidings""."
2,This is a great learning toywell Iwouldn't say toy!,"This was great for my 4 yr old son! He loved it! It was everything they said and more. My son Chris watered it from day 1 & it is still growing 6 weeks later. He loves it. He has the sunflower, the secert messege & the money 1 so we plan on planting them outside the new swingset he just received from his great-grandpa!Rock-OnThe Boos FamilyPennsville NJ"
2,Should have passed.,Not as easy or as useful as I was lead to believe. Need a more formal knowledge of guitar playing before purchasing.
3,"Good, but...","If you can't read music I wouldn't get this book. And as the title suggests, you should be a fairly advanced player. I find reading music to be tedious and boring but I learned it so I can teach it, and so I can read books like this one. This book would be much better if it had tab with rhythm charts."
2,My cats were unimpressed.,"I purchased this at a grocery store pet department closeout when my now 2 year old kitties were about 4 months old. I tried this toy in a variety of places since that time and they just never have been interested. The toy is well-made of quality products and is very soft and the bells are well attached.I think one problem with this toy is that it really isn't long enough to hang from the doorknob and the cat still play with it. Our doorknobs are standard height at 36"" from floor but it is still 24"" from floor. I have placed it on lower cabinet knobs and hung it from their cat tree where it was at eye-level and both cats were uninterested.I have two other cat toys of this brand. One is the feather wand and the seagull wand. Both my cats love the seagull but will have nothing to do with the wand. They are both quality made products as well."
3,Not Bad,"""Main Titles"" is the reason to buy the score. It is short, but the suspenseful theme is great. Until the last free songs on the track, the rest of the score is filled with decent suspense themes. Some more vibrant themes come to live in the end. The CD is strong, but it does run too short and is still slightly dull for casual listening."
4,Very nice product,"I would have given it a 5 star, but have yet to test the battery meter. Some say it is not accurate, we'll see. As for everything else, it is a well made/designed box. A previous reviewer posted a problem with the buckle, it is fine and can handle more than 30 lbs."
1,"TERRIBLE, Flimsy, case WILL break, 1st time used","Bought this for small engine on tender and the top is secured only by a cheap plastic handle and secured by strap in center of box. Plastic not strong enough for weight of any sized battery, anyone want to buy mine-cheap!!!"
2,needs a new revision,"I bought this book is to study up for the exam and example question, correct coding and information are an essential, BUT how can I study for the exam if this book is filled with errors?Am I suppose to develop an editor skill from this book besides knowing Flash?I do like the flow of the book, but the errors can make the information misleading leaving you puzzled.Someone should revise this book and send me a copy for free!And yes, the mysterious URL. I guess this book wants you to work on your web searching skills as well."
5,The name says it all...,"I use this on my Havanese puppy and it really does make him look/smell clean and fluffy. I hadn't been using it on his face too much because I was afraid that it wouldn't really be tearless. After reading a couple of reviews, I'll try it on his face during his next bath."
2,Not a good purchase.,"Granted, it has been a very hot summer, but I purchased these neck ice packs to wear while gardening and the ice inserts melt within the hour! Not a good purchase."
5,Fits even large necks,"We use to use frozen wet washclothes when working outside or at sporting events. We'd hold them on the back of our neck to instantly cool us down. Only problem was you had to hold them in place not to mention the mess as they thawed out. I have a 17.5"" neck and these bandana's fit me with plenty of string tie left over. In addition to wearing around our necks these could also be used to wrap around joints, etc to reduce swelling. We're glad we purchased them."
4,really long but very good bring me in game,its takes a while to get any where on the missions then when you get going theres no stopping you a must have if you love games thats hard and challege to you this is your kind of game
1,Useless,Doesn't even tell you how to market your franchise (to attract potential franchisees). Lots of the book is filled with fluff. Page 119 to 145 is Action Coach sales stuff.
5,A real gem,"This book definitely needs more praise than it is receiving.Electrical engineering is easily the most theoretical and math oriented of all the disciplines. Hayt and Buck don't try to glaze over this fact and they present to you electromagnetics in a very mathematical form. They also realize this is likely your first time playing around with Maxwell's equations so they take it easy on you too! This book is very thorough, very concise, filled with practical examples and if you put in your own time, a very rewarding read. I promise that by the end of it, you will have a much better grasp on electromagnetic phenomena occurring around you, leaving you with an intuition that will serve you well in your more advanced courses and later in your career."
1,"Hackneyed writing, stilted sitcom dialogue","This book is not worth $10. Don't waste your money. Terrible writing, stupid plot, silly people whom no one could possibly care about or identify with. How did this book get published? I want my $10 back to put towards something decent."
4,Great humorist,"You can read the plot summary above. All I can say is this author, besides being just plain hilarious,uses adjectives and adverbs that create perfect word pictures. A character is not dumb but ""comprehensively uninformed"", the grocery mart has a ""glacial express lane"", etc. And the characters are truly ""characters"". My husband, who is from Staunton, VA, is going to say this sounds more like West Virgina than Virginia, but, hey, the author's from Virginia, so who better?"
3,Signature song on album,"A disc jockey at my favorite radio station considers, ""Quiet Storm,"" the station's signature song. ""Quiet Storm,"" would be played from time to time."
3,"Just lie back, this won't hurt a bit...","The playing is, as always, wonderful. But the selection of tunes, and their saccharine arrangements, is almost comically sixties, from the breathy female choruses chanting ""Sign of the Times"" to the fiercely frugging blonde go-go dancers on the inside cover. A bit too much like what you might hear in your dentist's office fifteen years ago."
4,Digital Clock,I bought this for my mother in law who is suffering from dimentia. she was no longer able to read dial clocks so this worked out well for her. And it is large enough that she can see it across her apartment.
5,Great aid for people with dementia...,"Large numbers and letters make the clock easy to read. Not only does it provide the time, but it also gives the day of the week, and the date, which is extremely helpful for people who have difficulty keeping track of the days. Resetting the clock to coiincide with the time change was a litte difficult to navigate."
4,elderly in laws love it,i bought this for my elderly in-laws who had to look at the newspaper to know what day it was.they don't need too much at this point & asked for a clock that gave the day also.this was more than we had planned to spend but worth it since they can see it from almost anywhere in their fema trailer!
1,Clock failed entirely after 60 days,"Purchased Dynamic Living Oversized 16"" by 7.5"" digital LED calendar wall clock for my 92 year old mother March 20, 2012. Although she LOVED the clock and it helped her keep track of time and date, the clock has ceased to work at all after only 60 days. I cannot recommend this item. Would love to hear from seller."
3,Neck Ice Bandana,"The neck bandana is okay for me BUT a bit too big to actually help like I thought it would. I tried to tightened it, but it was just too big for my neck."
3,Not Quite,"It's nice, but it doesn't hold a lot of heat. It has a row of very small ice packs that freeze solid, inside a flexible plastic liner. Get a Medi-Temp hot/cold therapy pad instead."
4,Wonderful Wedding CD!,"I bought this CD to use for my wedding in October after listening to samples here. It was just as advertised and had a wonderful sound with great selections that I plan to use for the ceremony! Some of the classical songs seem to have a twist to them that modernizes them a bit and I really liked that. Yo-Yo Ma also featured in some of the music and he did a superb job with these pieces.I will be using the ""Prince of Denmark"" piece for the processional and a few other songs like ""Sheep May Safely Graze"" to set the pre-wedding mood!I definitely recommend for brides to be!"
1,Great spatula - for a month!,"I have a version of this spatula that I purchased locally more than a decade ago. It gets so much use in our house that I bought two more at Amazon, just a month ago. They have both failed at the weld points, less than four weeks after I bought them. (Meanwhile, the old one keeps on flipping just fine.)"
1,Less than one month!,"This item didn't even last 4 weeks. There are 4 points of connection for the handle to connect to the blade. Two of the connections have already separated and the two remaining won't last long. The whole thing is very cheaply made, not worth the price. I'm going to be looking for a replacement that has a full handle and extended (one piece) blade like theOXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Turneror something similar. There is an OXO version of the Ateco spatula, but I won't even chance it - looks identical except for the handle.Luckily, Amazon has a very good return policy.Add'l: while rinsing it off before mailing, the other two welds failed. At least, I can use a smaller box to mail it in :-}Really bad product."
2,nice but short,"I had been looking to replace my OXO Good Grips flexible Spatula that I gave to my mother in law. Though I found that same one, I went with this cheaper option. With shipping it ended up being about the same and I wish I had brought the original version. The blade on this one seems very sharp - not the case in my old OXO. It does the job, but I was able to use my old one on a nonstick frying pan to flip for over easy eggs without any issues. With the sharp edge I believe this one will scratch up my pan. I say pay the extra $3 or 4 and get the OXO one. This is also much shorter that the other one and I didnt pay attention to any details about length. Not meant for someone with big hands."
5,best cookie lifter ever!,"If you love to bake homemade cookies, this little spatula is a must-have. It is very thin and flexible so it slides under even the most delicate cookies with ease. It is made durably and cleans up easily. I bought it after seeing one being used on a TV cooking show and am very happy with my purchase!"
5,Great kitchen tool!,"I have one of these handy little spatulas, and although I think they're made for slipping cookies off a baking sheet, I find that nothing works better for omelettes. Just the right size and amount of flex. Inexpensive and well-made."
1,Junky product & support,"It worked OK until it broke into pieces after 3 months of light usage on my keychain. Their website's contact form does not allow any Mac web browsers (Safari or Firefox) to submit the form -- silent failure.This product is neither built to withstand the rigors of usage, nor is the manufacturer available to help you when their poorly made product disintegrates; not recommended. I guess I'll just throw mine out."
1,Outdated,"First off this album is great. So why the one star? Because it was released too early. Hits like Sexual Healing, Doggone, Ain't that Peculiar hadn't been made. So it's not that this album is bad, it's that if you're going to buy a Marvin Gaye album (which if you're reading this, you should!), you should buy The Very Best of Marvin Gaye, or atleast a more complete version made after his career. Marvin Gaye is awesome though, and the truth is that all of his albums are awesome, some are just better and more complete!"
5,Oxygen: A Mission Gone Desperately Wrong and No Way...,"The book arrived in excellent condition within the scheduled delivery time.Thank you,Francine Keehnel"
4,Very plausible and exciting,Oxygen is a refreshing sf/christian based novel that explores currnet technology while interjecting a relevant christian theme. The subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) interaction of the characters and easy to read tech. explanations leaves this reader at times breathless and alway introspective. Olsen and Ingermason have proven they are a strong combination within this genere and I look very forward to any and all future endeavors by these fine authors.
5,GREAT AND RARE COMPILATION,Track Listings:1. Reflections2. Love Is Here and Now You're Gone3. Someday We'll Be Together4. Love Child5. Some Things You Never Get Used To6. Forever Came Today7. In and Out of Love8. Happening9. I'm Livin' in Shame10. No Matter What Sign You Are11. Composer
5,My First Album,"I bought this album in 1969, right at the time Diana Ross left the Supremes for her solo career. I think it was $3.49.It still remains one of my favorite Diana Ross & the Supremes albums. My personal favorites were always ""Someday We'll be Together,"" ""Love Child, "" ""The Composer,"" and Livin' in Shame.""I know all these songs are on other greatest hits albums but this stringing of songs together will always bring me the finest Ross memories."
3,"All on ""1"" 1 hour track!","Okay, this album isn't great. the guitars are noisy, you really can't tell what song you are on by not only because it's all one track, but also all of the songs sound the same. This disc can be boring most of the times but it's isn't the worst thing in the world. If you do put this album in your MP3 player, maker sure you call the file by the name of the album."
1,Beware,"I'm into all of the anarcho-punk movement but yet, this band fails to live up to the greats (Like Crass and Zounds.) I cannot enjoy much of their other albums, but at least there's more than one track. This CD fails to escape the cassette days. It has one track that is one hour long. Even through fast forwarding it I couldn't find any decent music on it. I immediately returned it and I'm sure if you buy this, you'll wish you could too."
2,"the band is awesome ,But Freddy isn't , Sorry Freddy","I'm a big fan of Freddy ,but he doesn't have it like he used to. The band is great ! I was looking forward to the vocals of the ALIAS days ,which were the best . Better than Steve Perry .I'm sorry this didn't do it for me ,but don't give up Freddy ,try again ,just don't take so long"
5,True to Monroe,The credits on this CD look like a who's who of contemporary bluegrass (Ricky Scaggs and Allison Krauss are conspicuously missing) and give an indication of the quality of the music within. These folks play and sing their hearts out in a fitting tribute. They allow the Monroe genius to shine through without compromising the rich styles that 'brung them to the dance'.A must for any serious collector and a joy to hear.
3,Mixed bag,"The author travels across south america, tracking all places and people associated with che guevara on his youthful journey, taking on some of che's personality characteristics, including some dubious ones, like pretending to be someone more famous. But he is admirable for being willing to put up with the dust and grime of the journey.As a woman I found him a mixed bag, despite the worshipful reviews I read elsewhere, who despite his own admitted(?) ego (that too is a bit like che) is willing to call an older woman who refuses to reveal her age ""vain"" and thinks nothing of spying under the beds of female prison inmates, who though part of the bloodthirsty shining path movement, are nevertheless at that moment, in jail, and might have their privacy respected."
5,The best!,"Love this book! It is honestly one of my favorites, because it combines history, politics, travel, and funny commentary. Everything about this book makes it a good read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Che Guevara, Latin America, or just travel."
4,simple anatomy,I find using this flashcard i was able to improve my grades both in lecture and labaratory. The only drawback is not having the diagrams in color.
1,Glaring misspelling right on the cover!,"I was considering buying these cards, but the gross error on the cover has given me cause for pause. (Cover reads: AND A+! It should read AN A+!) Makes me wonder how many other mistakes there might be! Thank you."
1,A great thesis for a doctorate,"It may be me but I was hoping for much more information on Freemasons, Illuminati etc. The book begins in a very informaitive manner but loses it quickly. If you want tons of theories, speculation, opinions etc. on ""the pyramid"" and the evolution of American morality and values relative ot he Great Seal then buy the book. If you want to know about what the title implies you won't need to read too much of the book. Very intriquing info but not in the comtext of the title in my opinion."
5,Blueprint for our future,"Did you know you can find the Hero's Journey on the back of the one dollar bill? Fascinting. This is not a book about the conpriacies of secret societies to rule the world. On the other hand, it shows that freemasons and illuminati had absolutely nothing to do with the design of the great seal. Maybe that's why he did not give much space to talking about them. I read the original version of this book which has a more appropriate title (America's Secret Destiny: Spiritual Vision and the Founding of a Nation), but this revised edition is far and away a better book. I would have given it four stars because I don't like the new title, but I think it's usually marketing departments that pick titles, not the authors."
2,Disapointed,"This book deals with some fairly rediculous topics. I'm not into mysticism or talisman's or that stuff, so perhaps I am biased.It did provide a useful history of the 'masonic' symbol on the American one-dollar bill, which I enjoyed.But Hieronimus puts forth far too much theory regarding supernatural powers for my taste."
1,Line doesnt fit trimmer,i bought a trimmer that takes .115 line and you sent me .130 line that doesnt fit my trimmer. Thanks to you I wasted 12.50 on line I cant use.
5,Great CD!!!!,"I like every single song on this album. They are beautiful, meaningful songs. Unlike some singers, who just gab away about nothing at all, and whose lyrics make absolutely no sense. I love the way they harmonize. If you don't get this album, you'll be dissapointed!"
4,No Rocky Top,"Great CD, but Amazon's song list is wrong. This disk does NOT include Rocky Top. As a Vol fan, this song was one I really wanted, and as you can guess, I was really disappointed that it wasn't included. But, the Bluegrass is great listenin' anyhow."
3,"Good at teaching, but doesn't teach you the right words.","This is good at teaching you the words, but it doesn't teach you the right words. If you want to know how to say, ""Up the corner to the right."", cool, but you're going to need more than that. This only teaches you 300 words or phrases. If you are going to learn Korean, you need to start with the basics. This teaches you some useful phrases, but most of it is useless. Unless you are going there on a 2 day buisness trip."
5,Another winner for Doc Watson,"I've never heard a Doc Watson song I didn't like, which is something I can't say about many other artists out there, so it wasn't a big surprise to me that I absolutely loved this CD. If you already like Doc Watson, get this, it's fantastic. If you don't know Doc Watson, you should remedy that situation as soon as possible, and this album is the perfect one to start your collection with. It has a huge variety of music on it, from bluegrass to folk to blues to driving old-time instrumentals and more. It's sort of a sampler of Doc Watson's long and fruitful musical career. There's something for everybody on this recording."
5,Simplemente Insuperable...,"Hola ciber compardores, sólo unas líneas para este disco doble, porque realmente las merece, desde hace varios años este album se hacia esperar, todos los exitos de Franco de Vita, y no es necesario que los mencione, si vives enamorado, y eres bien feeling, imposible que te lo pierdas. Más que como admirador de Franco, como admirador de la BUENA MUSICA... olvidemos a Ricky Martin, J Lo y esos cantantes basura... sólo pon el disco y siéntate al lado de la persona que más amas... y a escuchar... No te arrepentirás..."
4,Awesome soundtrack,"This is a great sountrack, equally as great as the movie. I wouldn't recommend buying the soundtrack without seeing the movie, as it's important to keep the music in the context in which it was written. A great CD, even for the twenty-somethings!"
4,Great summaries of records for railway employee ancestors,"Does not include much info on laborers or those working on building railways, but comprehensive coverage for railway employees. It really needs a DVD or locality (city) index so you can search for probable employers based on location."
4,An amazingly complex and enjoyable history,"The book is a really exciting, amazingly thorough history of the pin-up genre from the feminist point-of-view. Both as a feminist philosopher and model photographer I found it and extraorinarily useful.Of course, if you decide to read this book, you have to prepare yourself for a vast intellectual challenge. It is a complex weave of very different thoughts; the chapters are regulary cross-references so you have to keep many things is mind.It could have been made a bit even more enjoyable with two things. First of all, there are several dozens of pages at the end of the book -- at this quantity, these would have been much more useful as footnotes. Secondly, much more pictures would have been much better. Parargraph-long description of pin-up pictures would be unnecessary if the reader could see the pictures itself."
5,hoops like hula hoops,"My six year old grandson wanted ""hula hoops"" for Christmas. He was really happy to have received multiple hoops which he shared with his sister and other kids in the hood. Good buy."
5,Must see!!!,"The poorest man is not without a cent but without a dream... With hard work, determination and a dream, anything is possible! RISEandSHINE!"
4,"Great Designs, Simple & Easy to follow, but one thing....","I enjoyed this book, I found quite a bit of projects that I will be adding to my to-do list so I didn't regret the buy. I don't have the money to pay a copying place to enlarge some patterns on the back, so in my attept to do it myself was somewhat okay. I was able to enlarge 3 pages in the books, but when it came to enlarging quilt patterns---it was nearly impossible--they were basic squares and rectangles and I wish she had written somewhere in the book the measurements.If you can get it copied for you--then get the book....there are a lot of great ideas and pretty cool projects."
5,"Great songs, download needs a bit of work","Many great songs here (thus my 5 stars) by the wonderful Franco and his colleagues. Yet once again the transfer of a Sonodisc CD to MP3 seems to be slightly unusual. The songs are misnamed, or rather the names are all correct but given to the wrong songs at least in my download. As far as I can tell this is the correct naming (look at the track lengths):1. Partagez 13:032. Chacun Pour Soi 7:563. Adieu! Je M'en Vais 8.454. Tu Es Méchante 7.115. Ngai Te 7:326. Laissez-Passer 7:117. Missile 7.07Perhaps my download was quirky but I post this just in case it helps anyone else."
4,Hours of fun!,"Neil LeBute is back with a vengeance in this collection of sassy, sexy, sordid stories! Actually, maybe none of them are sexy, unless you're into that sort of thing. If you're a fan of his films, I'd recommend picking this up. The stories are dark at times, disturbing at others, and sometimes you just may have a good laugh or two.It's a pretty short read, and most of the stories are hits with only one or two ""meh's"". A couple of the stories I couldn't quite get a picture of what was going on as he doesn't really set up scenes, and just tosses you in the middle of the action and the characters thoughts. Not a bad thing, as it usually works quite nicely as you're kind of drifting from one characters thoughts to another from story to story.Also, be careful where you read this book, the cover looks like some sort of weird steamy romance novel."
3,too scratchy to be brilliant,"neil labute's collection of short stories plumb the extremes. at times, sparklingly insightful and at other times mind-numbingly cliched. the author delights in devious and dark tales populated by characters that one can hardly empathise with. the writing is always sharp and edgy but not always entertaining or enlightening.a lot of the stories have a trademark dark twist, but soon one tires of them. the 20 stories collected here are, sadly, a bit too single tracked. one wishes that labute had provided enough variety in characters and situations. and while one desperately wishes to come across characters that are adorable, nobody can complain that they are dull.in all, one fels that the editor lets her author down here, probably not adding enough variety to the collection. neil labute shows glimpses of his ability to stun and shock the reader, but the trick tires quickly. part magical madness, part mundane mayhem. a half-way performance."
2,"Good for the serious military bunker researcher, but...","The book would be much more interesting if the author didn't make such a major effort to link facts & speculation regarding known & suspected hardened military structures (bunkers) with gross speculation regarding UFO conspiracy theories. He amassed a lot of research material regarding bunkers, but it is tarnished by his idle UFO paranoia."
2,So so,This book is kinda interesting and not much more than that. In fact the only interesting content is a discussion of tunnel making technology.
4,Good Work,"My Cherie Amour is another solid late 60's album from Stevie Wonder. The title cut is one of the best ballads he's ever done. It has lush orchestration and a supple vocal. Many of the other songs are in this vein including ""Hello Young Lovers"", ""You & Me"", ""Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares"" and ""At Last"". ""Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday"" has a great vocal and ""Light My Fire"" is based on the Jose Feliciano version not The Doors'."
5,Very Soulful,"This Album Is Very Essential.I've Dug Stevie Wonder from the time I First Really Listened to Music.The Title Cut is a Classic.Yester Me,Yester You,Yesterday is a Classic Song as well.The Man Has Always Been A Genius."
