5,Great Movie for Kids,"My 9 year old Loved this movie, its a great family movie, I recommend this for everyone. The Amazon HD streaming quality was great also, I streamed it from my XBOX 360"
3,Typical,Mild teen/young adult entertainment.And number two fell in line or at this point last place if you are going in an order.
4,"Good, but some weird characters","In general, I found this movie to be enjoyable. My daughter (seven years old) really loves it. She's read all the books, as have I. This movie really is a few stories from many of the books combined to make one story, but in my opinion, it works.Most of the characters are great, especially Rowley and Roderick. They're both robust, well written, and steal the scenes they are in. Steve Zahn is ok as the Dad, but halfway through the movie he turns orange. Seriously... it's like he overdosed on spray tan. Very distracting. I wish they had left out the 'Angie' part, however. She's a HORRIBLE actress, and she looks like she's about 20. Her character gave me the creeps and I felt like they were trying WAY too hard to fulfill the role of 'deep' girl.Other than that, I look forward to the next Wimpy Kid movie!"
3,OK film let down by Dylan playing up to the camera and terrible sound and picture quality,"""Don't Look Back"" is OK but not the masterpiece many other reviews would lead you to believe. Sound and picture quality are very poor, concert performances are attenuated (oh so frustrating!), and the verbal jousting of Dylan with reporters and fans becomes tiresome especially when we can see it's obviously just a put-on for the cameras.Still it does capture some of the energy of Dylan at this time - just before he went electric - and the seediness of the touring life."
2,Boraning,I am a huge Dylan but this is a boring and pointless documentary with no real beginning middle and end. It has no real coherency. Skip it...
5,For budding engineers,"The quality is that of regular clothes, not just a costume. Will last through repeated play. Looks exactly as advertised. Your future engineer will love this!"
3,Runs small,Ordered this for my train brain 7 yr old for halloween and other occasions. He is wearing about a size 7 but the 6 8 was basically too small. He wore it too short in the legs with the adjusters at shoulders fully extended and won't be able to wear it again. Bit disappointed since I thought $40 was a lot to pay and only justified it thinking he would wear it for a while to play in. He wore it one other time other than Halloween and one of the buttons at the waist fell right off. I hate to see how disappointed he will be that it won't fit again.Pros: It was totally cute. Hat runs bigger and is adjustable. Gloves are leather!
2,Simply skip it!,"Reading reviews and thumbing through the book in a homeschool store, I decided to pick this one up. I should have left it behind. The first few lessons were alright, however it quickly became painfully grueling. We switched to Winston Grammar and all has been well ever since. On the up side, I love the illustrations in the book. So I repurposed the book totaly to use the drawings as creative writing story starters."
3,Simply Not As Good as the Rest!,"I really wanted to love this book. I really did! The cover and pictures are beautiful. I'm a big fan of Charlotte Mason's educational philosophy. I liked what appeared to be a simple approach. But upon using it with a real child, I discovered that it's wording was way too archaic and wordy. Example: ""The subject is that of which we speak."" Rather than the much simpler wording of ""the subject is 'who' or 'what' the sentence is about.""I am using ""First Language Lessons"" currently and find this text more user and child friendly. I have looked through ""English for the Thoughtful Child"" and although I have not used it yet, it too looks better than ""Simply Grammar.""I will say that ""Simply Grammar"" has the most appealing cover of the three!"
2,Book was in very very very poor condition,The book content was great but the physical book fell apart. The book literally fell apart as I read it; the pages were so very old that they lost their binding and came off as I turned each page.
4,Sebadoh one step short of greatness,"Why Sebadoh are not huge is a mystery. It is remarkable that after a decade of getting nowhere comercially with some of the most brilliant tunes to cross the Atlantic, Sebadoh should have their first UK hit single with the good but undistinguished Flame. The Sebadoh is the most listenable of the band's albums and overall it is pretty good, but somehow lacks the edge of Bakesale. It's All You and Love is Stronger are among the best songs Jason and Lou have given us, and there are other worthy moments here. But whether it is the definitive Sebadoh album, despite the title, is doubtful."
1,What a rip off...,"My uncle ordered this pack of pencils for me and I got a box in the mail with 1 pencil in it. It said on the packing slip to contact ""Customer Service"" for help and there was no number or address for customer service. I would not order this item, as you may get ripped off just like me."
4,Stickler,It's a good tool for someone in cheerleading or tumbling who has problems with back handsprings and keeping their legs together for proper form.
3,More Mature Than You Might Think,"We used this book as part of my daughter's 5th-grade classical homeschool curriculum, per the recommendation found in The Latin-Centered Curriculum. I wanted to warn others that the subject matter, which includes rape, gender transformations and incest, is somewhat mature for fifth grade, and the illustrations are grapic and include a nude woman. Parents who are planning to use this book may find it helpful to be warned about this content in advance. I certainly would have!"
3,Good grill,Seems like a good grill for the price. The instructions were somewhat murky at one point in the construction. No problems otherwise at this point in time.
1,Not happy,"Shipment was fast, but very disappointed that it listed the firm band was included and it is actually missing.... Not happy!"
1,A good tribute but....,"If you have not heard the originals, then buy them first. If you want to explore then try the album ""Comes in Colors"""
3,"Slam, Bam, Thank You, Pam!","There are only two special features on this DVD, and they both belong to Pam Grier. And that's reason enough to buy it! She has two nude scenes in this lackluster blaxploitation thriller that largely fails to thrill, and her sparkle is the only spark here. A good cast, including Jim Backus, Earha Kitt, Carl Weathers, Scatman Crothers, and Yaphet Kotto, is wasted here, but they try their best with what they're given. The movie is in widescreen and the image quality is excellent. There's the movie trailer and a scene and language selector, and that's it. For `70s blaxploitation genre fans and Pam Grier fans only, but that's quite a large audience!"
3,So-So Pam Grier Vehicle,"Pam Grier is fine as the spunky photo-journalist title character and Yaphet Kotto is amusing as her P.I. sidekick helping her ferret out the ""black widow"" conspiracy. Their efforts are essentially for naught in this sluggishly directed actioner that has the substance of your average Spelling-Goldberg production. Lots of prominent African-American talent on hand(Eartha Kitt, Godfrey Cambridge, Scatman Crothers,etc.) but their impact is marginal. What this film needed was Sid Haig!"
3,Friday Foster,Wasn't her best movie but if you're as big a fan of Pam Grier as I am it's a must own to fill out your collection.
3,Non-Madonna Tracks,"""Space 99"" is a Mad'house original instrumental song.""Lady of the Dawn"" is a re-make of the song by someone named Mike Batt.I didn't find anything for ""Be Yourself"" except Madhouse and Audioslave, so it's probably an original song, also.(( I only listened to the samples on this page, but I had to rate it to post my comments ))"
4,magic box,"I really like the dividers I just hoped that 1/2 of the box could have been open for bigger spaces like 3-4 inches, very useful, I love it and the soft plastic makes them unbrakable since the actual user is 3 years old I like the fact the wont brake if he drops them. Great product!!"
5,Med and vitamin storage container,"Excellent storage for meds and vitamins.I store up to a few weeks' vitamins and meds. I labelled each compartment with a ""sharpie"" so that the title does not fade.Arrived on time."
5,My Review On The Monster Channel,"This book is awesome! I loved it so much! If you like scary books, the is the one for you! It is my favorite book! Out of everyone I know who's read it (that's a lot of people), they all loved it! I am telling you - you should REALLY read this book!"
4,Fun anime ( the manga is even better!),"Tactics is a fun series with interesting characters (although they're even more fun in the manga- the TACTICS are more obvious there as Kantaro is much more devious). Fantasy, magic, mystery, supernatural events, fiesty characters, humor, drama & sadness(there are some heavy issues here & there) all tied up in a well-illustrated package. The mood is beautifully set with particularly well done backgrounds."
2,Problems with the wheels!!!,I was exited to give this to my son for his birthday yesterday. When he opened it he started playing with them and had fun. But when I tried to help him make a car the wheels don't stay on the axel part. It's still an ok toy but making cars and trucks with them is fun. If someone know how to fix this problem please let me know...
4,"Good for sationary use, not for road traveler","Pros:-Light weight-Side mouse caddy tucks away under the main unit for storage-Durable, I've had mine for 5 years so far-Easy to clean if neededCons:-Odd shape makes it difficult to pack up into a standard laptop carrying case-Bottom of unit is 'grated' and uncomfortable have on your lap for extended periods of time-Wrist rest isn't very comfortable, but not uncomfortable either just kind of pointless"
5,Exciting and suspenseful.,Watching this show reminds me of the famous bible battles of the old testament. It is very exciting and suspensful. This should be mandatory viewing for every high school student. The public needs to understand what the Israeli people have been dealing with.
3,Loses some screen sensitivity.,"I bought this for my wife's Nintendo DS Lite to replace a previous screen protector that had begun to show scratches. This protects well, but she says the screen input is much less accurate. She uses the DS Lite mostly for playing Sudoku in the Brain Age (1 and 2) packs. With the Hori screen protector, she has more incidents where the DS Lite fails to pick up the correct number. For example, she writes a 1 and it picks up as a 5 or 3. The 4 seems particularly hard to communicate to the screen. There is also more ""drag"" or resistance felt in the cursor with the Hori screen protector."
4,The bubbles disappeared on their own,"It's easy to apply. The screen protectors are between two other plastic sheets. First wipe the screen (with the included cloth), then you peel off one plastic sheet and face down the middle sheet (actual protector) to the screen and slowly press it down as you lay it out. Finally peel off the top sheet. I had no trouble applying the top screen protector, but I had to reapply the bottom screen protector several times because of bubbles. I eventually ended up with a couple of bubbles in the bottom middle before I gave up. Surprisingly, they disappeared on their own the next day. Seems like it's not really necessary to press out the bubbles as per the instructions.Definitely buy to protect your NDS."
3,Does the job...but isn't there anything better than this?,"Easy to use and the price is nice, but seriously, it's obviously a ""cheap"" way to cover the screen and it shows. Has anyone found something that works without putting a bit of a cloudy film on their DS screen?"
3,Corny Yet Entertaining,"Okay it was the 80's and a lot of songs back then were corny and bubble gum fluff. Paula's debut is a great dance track but the lyrics are babyish and numbing. Her second LP was ten times better than this debut. My all-time favorite Paula song is"" Knocked Out "" which was the only reason I bought the cassette. Additionally I enjoyed "" I Need You "" which included a beautiful saxaphone piece and "" One or the Other "" but even that song was corny. Paula headed the ranks in the 80's with this album so it's definitely worthy buying. Paula works hard with each song and keeps up the beat wonderfully even if the songs seemed to be written by a three year-old. Then again, it fit into the 80's."
1,She Has NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Talent!,"Paula Abdul is not only a talentless loser, she's also suffering from a mental breakdown because of all the negative publicity surrounding her after she had an affair with an American Idol dude young enough to be her son."
4,Essential for anyone interested in Falconry or Raptors,"This is a great book for anyone interested in falconry! EmmaFord describes everything in detail and she guided me through myapprenticeship with ease. However, it also contains sound advice for the experienced falconer.She discusses the most common hawks used in the sport and guides one through the manning and training of the three main groups: Shortwings, Broadwings and Longwings. At the end of the part dealing with the training of the group, she explains hunting with them in detail.There is a complete chapter on equipment and will help the apprentice to choose the right equipment, with the hawk's safety in mind .For those unfamiliar with falconry terms, there is a nice glossary explaining them in detail.I would advise anyone interested in hunting with birds of prey to get this great book by one of the leaders in the field! END"
5,BEST CD RELEASED IN 1999. Vegas definetly a rule 2000.,"Vegas a mash up di place,wid 'im hot looks and bashment lyrics.Vegas done hot,FI REAL!"
1,JD's Revenge,"I perserved with this DVD, but it was certainly a 'B' rated. Considering the actors where known the story line was poor. Not a film I would keep in my collection, very disappointing."
1,Junk,Pins are weak. The second time I used it the pins for the CF card bent over. I threw it in the trash.
3,"I don't know, mate...","Everyone seems to love this record, and I can see why. It's relaxed, old-tyme bluegrass from some of the masters, both (then) young and old. I don't want to come down too critically on this album, as it is quite solid, but - to my ears - that's the problem. It's solid without being inspirational.Be honest- if you weren't familiar with the cast, it would just be another bluegrass album, no? It's just a hodgepodge of famous names, and very rarely do these all-star casts ever prove inspirational. Everyone seems to be enjoying everyone else's company, perhaps sipping a drink or two, and singing a few tunes here and there. Even Doc Watson sounds a little flat, save for ""Black Mountain Rag."" That should tell you something.If you want FANTASTIC bluegrass, save your money. Buy a Kentucky Colonels or a Muleskinner record. Heck, buy an original album by any of these artists that have fire, inspiration, and are truly sensational."
2,Not as gruesome as you think.,"Having read Lucifer's Lottery and Infernal Angel twice, I was expecting to be wowed by this book, I wasn't.Sure, there are some horrific descriptions of violent rapes and tortures, and the creekers are quite fascinating, but most of the focus is on Phil Straker who is not the most fascinating character in the world. I mean, that sex scene between him and Susan felt like Penthouse letter nonsense. It as equally annoying having to read all that boring talk about love and how he loves her and how he wants her and how sad he is that his relationships with women never work out. Come on, Lee! If I wanted to read a paperback romance I would have bough one at the supermarket."
5,ON PAR WITH THE MISSION & ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST,"Maestro Morricone's music to this apparently neglected film deserves not to be neglected. It equals the majesty and scope of his best scores like THE MISSION and ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. It features full, big orchestral sound and range, and several selections feature some of Edda Dell'Orso's finest vocals. Several melodic pieces with several themes and variations, plus some action underscoring pieces, as well. If you love Morricone's music, and have not heard these compositions, you really are missing out. In my collection, this is ESSENTIAL MORRICONE."
5,"In a world of revivals, finally a new musical with bite!","Fascinated with the legend of Lizzie Borden since a young child, I was thrilled to discover a new musical based on one of the most spine-tingling murder cases in American history. Alison Fraser sparkles as the accused hatchet murderess in Christopher McGovern and Amy Powers's theatrical masterpiece. Very soon, I hope, this highly entertaining musical will get the professional production it deserves on the Great White Way. This disc is A MUST for any musical theatre freak!"
4,"Heath Zenith BL-6133-LA Basic Solutions Wireless Switch and Wall Switch,",What a time saver for my outdoor project. Used this switch to control a single outlet outside that powered a transformer for some low voltage lights on the patio and other areas. Good range 50 ft max thru a lot of wood and metal. It worked so well I used it to power other outdoor lights and I didn't have to run any additional power lines to the patio.Switches are kind of ugly wife wouldn't let them be installed on the wall but they hid nicely under a cabinet. Multi-channel capable have two units running on separate channels with no issues. Have noticed after power outages that they like to turn themselves on when power is restored not a big issue luckily that doesn't happen too often.
3,Off and On,Works pretty good but sometimes the remote switch doesn't work. There is no consistency to the failure but for the majority of the time is works handily.
5,Cooley High,"an entertaining ""male""coming of age trip down memory lane in a black community, that touches on triumphs, tragedies and stereotype. many of the events and topics covered, will be very familiar to those that grew up during the '60s in lower income big city neighborhoods. focusing on the lives of the local hero,wanna be's,and thugs, i find ""Cooley High"" comes very close to being a realistic rendition of how things were when i grew up."
4,Worked good!,"Worked good and did come with an extra condom, I just thought it overall made it look creepy like I was screwing an alien or something but other than that no complaints :) lol"
1,"over priced, terrible lunch bag","Don't waste your $$ on this one, I bought 2 and they frayed the 1st week of school. Both bags. All around the zipper. I have pictures. Just not happy at all with these. The also cannot be wiped out if something get spilled in it, and what child does not spill something in their lunch bag?"
2,"Readers are a dime a dozen, unfortunately...","The unGodly amount of material in Hollywood is the only reason readers unfortunately exist. A better use of your money might be to purchase 3 or 4 of your favorite screenplays and read them. Look how they are written and use that format. Buy a couple text books on writing for general guidelines. Then take your money and start hitting the streets meeting people. You're best bet is to have an ""in"" at the place youre pitching your material.Is it a bad book? No. Is it a must have? Absolutely not. A few good pointers, but alot of self-centered, self-important tips that won't make or break your deal. If you have an original idea or a new twist, that may be enough. The best bet is to take that original idea (if there are any left)and punch out a good screenplay. Do your homework, get good honest feedback and don't give up."
4,Valuable and does the job you wanted,"This is a useful book that I will plan to pick up over and over again. She gives you five hundred reasons that make sense, even though they may come across as the same things over and over again, it isn't. I haven't professionally sold a script; I have been writing for twenty years and she gives great advice on what to avoid when writing it. Thanks to the author."
2,This is about me?,"Yeah, I'm a reader. Yeah, I'm the guy that Lerch and her exclamation points are trying to help you get past. So naturally, because I'm insanely egotistical and convinced my position in Hollow-wood is amazingly important, I was fascinated to read all about myself and what I like and what I don't like. Don't get me wrong -- I didn't buy the book. I just borrowed it. What would people think if they saw it in my bookshelf? (""Gawd. Is he trying to write a script? I thought he just read them."") So will this book help you write a script that I'll like? Maybe. More likely is that it'll just annoy you. And keep this in mind: ten thousand readers can like your script, but never once has a reader bought a script. It's the development people, the producers, the c.e.'s who cut the checks. So writing for us is shooting a little low, don't you think?"
4,Absorbing Historical Account Of A Civil War Battle & Siege,"This is an excellent account of the Battle and subsequent Siege of Vicksburg during 1863. The author, James Arnold, writes a detailed account of the events and incidents leading up to General Grant closing a ring around the defences of Vicksburg. The author covers the plans and ideas of the Union and Confederate Commanders and their political masters during this battle. His narrative of the fighting is well presented and very stiring and although you could probarly find more detailed accounts, he still tells a great story. I had only one problem with this book and that was the authors narrative in connection with map 8, The Battle of Champion Hill. I felt that his directions mentioned in the text did not match the map but maybe I was wrong (maybe someone can let me know?). Either way this is a good story and well worth the time to sit down and read."
5,Bi-Lingual Canzoniere,"Everyone should read the beautiful and romantic poems by Francesco Petrarca, one of the great masters of Italian literature! Scholar Robert M. During has masterfully translated the Canzoniere poems in this bi-lingual edition, allowing you to enjoy them in either the original Italian or English."
1,Great way to defend your children from critical thought!,"Sending my kids from college, where I couldn't have complete control over everything they hear and say I was worried that they would forget about the importance of ignorance. This book helped them to better understand the proper ways to plug one's ears and scream la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you in the face of those who try to combat my faith with things like facts, logic, and questioning your beliefs. One should never be faced with the grim situation of wondering if a traditional value is indeed correct. Treat your children with this book and they will thank you down the road for all of the not-learning they will have accomplished!"
4,A thrilling return to rock music.,"Good ol' rock music has been seriously lacking from the lineups of major labels. This release from Moth, a band that honed their sound by playing in the amazingly underrated Cincinnati music scene is one giant step in the right direction.While it's easy to pick out specific influences of the band,(Weezer and The Pixies jump out)the band manages to mix and disguise the sounds of those that came before them into a mix that is incredibly infectious and sounds surprisingly fresh in the sea of god-awful-drek that is force fed to us by major labels.It's a great album from a great band, and I hope they are very successful in future efforts. Fans of The Pixies, Weezer, and Idlewild will be thrilled with this release."
4,Inside look at Japanese culture,"I loved this contemporary mystery novel set in Japan with a feisty, independant Japanese/American protagonist. It is a twist on the English Country Manor Mystery solved by amateur sleuth, as it is a Japanese Inn Mystery solved by a complex young woman who gives a lot of insight into the melding of the Japanese & Western cultures in modern day Japan. A good mystery."
1,Xenophobe,"I bought three of Massey's books at one time due to the fact that she won the Agatha Award for ""The Salaryman's Wife."" I usually give a book 100 pages before giving up, but I couldn't get past 40 or so without feeling thoroughly disgusted. How on earth could she have won an award for this piece of trash?The main character, Rei Shimura is xenophobic. I have no doubt that Ms. Massey really lived and worked in Japan, but she couldn't have been here very long because her character's disdain for all things foreign reflects homesickness typical of the newly arrived. Her command of the Japanese language betrays her longevity, however, and that's what's unforgivable.Save your money."
4,A good effort,"Tangerine DreamPhaedra(Virgin 1974)This was a good one from TD but it lacked the adventurous spirit of the best recordings. This one comes to close to being atonal. Still, for 1974 it was amazing stuff (and I remember that time well). I still like it but it's not one I love. Four Stars."
4,Depends on your point of view.,"If you're into more industrial/ebm style synthesizer music, stay clear of this title, instead get Tangerine Dream's 'Exit' album. TD uses alot of great textures in Phaedra, but it ends up sounding very bland. If you're into ambient electronic, this is almost beyond 5 stars, but most people that have heard later TD albums, will be disapointed with this highly praised early release. This is definately one for the collectors, or for ambient music aficionados. But this is a review, and not opinion, so if you like ambient/ethereal, purchase this one. If you want something more aggressive, yet still TD, get ""EXIT""."
3,Thomas A. Edison,"This book is essentially unadulterated Edison. Martin Melosi (author) wrote a very very detailed book about one of the great inventors. The book is a little boring, but if you want to learn A LOT about Edison this book is for you. But don't take my word for it...wait actually you should"
5,I love it. This work is The Words of Jesus Christ; My very best Friend,"Thgis is my Lifeline to Awakening my Spirit within. Truly is ""The Second Coming of Christ. For those who are Serious seekers. It is a revelation!!"
5,Deep Reading for Deep Times,"It makes YOU think. You no longer allow others to evaluate you, rather God's joy,peace and love allows you to except yourself and others with all of our flaws. You tend to think: WE ARE WITNESS NOT JUDGES after reading this book. The world looks greener the flowers smell fresher and people do not look as dark. The writing takes getting used to because I kept wondering who was the judge writing this book. Enjoyable."
4,Good book,"Seems like a really good book but it's really dense, really difficult to understand. It certainly requires re-reading. It could be a lot more useful if it was a little bit easier to read since a lot of people won't read more than once. But I'm gonna try again."
4,Healing the Mind,one of the best books to learn of healing the mind. if you follow the workbook miracles will happen and change your life. it feels like you live in heaven.
1,The original version is much better.,"I have studied ACIM for over 20 years. I find that this version is over-edited, poorly edited, and leaves out a significant amount of material. I highly recommend ""A Course in Miracles: Original Edition by Helen Schucman (May 6, 2011)"", instead."
2,Love the Course BUT not this edition,"I love the Course and highly recommend it to anybody searching for a little sanity in this world. All totally great and transforming stuff. This review relates not to the content of the Course but to the physical dimensions of this particular printing of the book. Warning: this edition is a new, smaller book with much smaller print than all previous versions of the blue book. The dimensions are 8 x 5 x 1.5 inches versus the usual 9.5 x 6.5 x 1.5. The pagination is the same as the most recent versions so the only difference is the smaller font. This might not seem like much of a difference - indeed, this might be preferential for somebody wanting a smaller book to carry about - but it results in pages with much smaller print making it even harder to read ;-)"
2,A Course in Miracles,"I already have the book, which consists of three parts i.e the Text, the Workbook and Notes for Teachers and I wanted to buy the Kindle version rather than carry a thick paperback when I travel. Unfortunately, this Kindle version is only the Workbook, therefore only one third of the whole Course In Miracles. Perhaps this is why the price is so reasonable but really the description should make it clear before purchase."
5,This should be required reading for EVERYONE on the planet!,I'm just getting into the book and already see (in combo with the intro book) what a wonderful philosophy and way to live!
4,"Overinflated, yes but we LOVE this car seat","Sure it's pricey and there are plenty of lower cost alternatives but we still love this car seat. Perfect for children who sleep frequently in the car, the extended head wings provide head support with none of the usual drooping. The seat is very comfortable with padding on the easy to wipe down cover. Both the Graco Turbo Booster and Eddie Bauer seats do not compare and have been banished to our husbands' cars. (...)"
4,Cotton Gloves,"These gloves are great. At night I put hand cream on and apply the gloves when I go to bed for dry hands. This really helps get rid of ""dry hands""."
3,tramp for the Lord,quite interesting life experience of a lady who with God's help to redirect her later life after all the suffering in the concentration camp during ww II.
3,ehh,"I was expecting this book to be more like ""The Hiding place"" (A very very very good book). I had to stop with two or three chapters left because I couldn't take it any more."
4,I don't know what everyone else is talking about?,"How can anyone give this album only 3 stars? This album is great! I got Knapsack's other cd ""This conversation is ending starting right now"", before i got this one, ""silver-sweepstakes"" i liked ""This conversation...."" <b>a lot</b> so i decided to get this CD. When i got it I wasn't expecting it to be that good due to the reviews i read on this site....boy was i wrong....this cd is just as good, mabey even better! If you like Knapsack get this cd......i'm getting their other cd, ""day 3 of my new life"" when i can find it at any CD store... if you like these people you MiGhT like these people...The Juliana Theory, The Get Up Kids, PieBald, Sunny Day Real Estate...ect. ect. ect."
3,Not as good as day three of my new life,"I didn't really like this disc as much as Day 3 of my new life. Knapsack has kept their semi-melodic emo-punk sound intact, but to be honest Blair's voice grates on me this time around. The guitar work adds a nice touch, quite punchy and raw, and works well at keeping the band from sounding that wimpy. They matured in 97 and onward. I actually saw these guys live when Day 3 was coming out...they are quite good live. Moving up on the Emo circuit, but certainly not the best yet..."
4,"Nice starter set of monsters, but,","the ogre is going to need some work to get the arms to fit properly. Orc shipped seperate from his/her shield, which must be glued on. Displacer beast needs some work to get proper fit as well. Goblins are nice, with spears and shields. Dire rat is on a chest, with a skull next to the chest. Nice touch. This is a decent set (I bought two), and contains some of the early monsters characters run against. Would be nice to see some kobolds and skeletons added to another set."
4,Sayonara is old school movie at its best,Marlin Brando was the main star but Red Buttons stole this movie hook line and sinker.
3,A journalist is not a scientist.,"When I read a review of this book in the New York Times, I thought this would be an interesting and informative presentation of the latest research in the field of quantum mechanics.Unfortunatly it lacks depth in technical details and scientific description.For example, the author seems to attribute to Murray Gell-Mann the notion of algorithmic complexity (p. 163): the complexity of a string of bits is measured by the shortest computer program capable of reproducing it. This is actually well known as the Kolmorov complexity. The author seems completly unaware of this. I remained largely eager to read somewhere else to learn more about the subject, since I could not find any precise description in that book.This book can be taken as an apetizer, but do not expect good and reliable scientific description from it."
4,all balls,"Bird Blobs are terrifying and fascinating. Live they are something else and this is a fantastic album from a brilliant label that anyone brave enough should own. You may only want to go here sometimes, but you know you have to go. Wait and see about these guys they're in it for the long haul and they're only going upward"
2,"Very informative, but will never use","Yes, OK, Montessori is a great way for children to learn with play. Yes, many children can benefit greatly from this method. Yes, this book explictly lays out guidlines for this method, and includes lots of activities for preschoolers to do. BUT, even as a stay-at-home mom, I cannot imagine doing more than two or three of these activities at home. WAY too complex and involved. If you are a teacher, this book is for you. If you are a mom looking for educational activities to do with your children, look elsewhere. I was very excited about recieving this book, but it just didn't cut it for me. I don't have a sand table at home, and I don't have time to read this whole book (which is surprisingly substantial). Can't I just do flash cards or some fun crafts instead?"
3,ok sprinkles,"i was ordering these sprinkles to decorate goodies for my son's 2nd bday party... they arrived promptly, however just looking at the contents in the bag it appears a lot of the sprinkles are broken and now in crumbs... i haven't opened the bag yet to see the extent of the damage, but i'm thinking it may have come in better condition if it were in a hard container like sprinkles you buy at the store (these sprinkles were in a bag & shipped in a box)..."
3,An allright read,"I've read all of Michael Prescotts books', as well as all the ones he wrote under the name Brian Harper.I have to say that compared to all his other page turners, this one was bland and lacking.Still a decent read - but I was definitely expecting more."
3,Dangerous Games was a pretty good book.,Pretty good book not quite as exiting or mysterious as I prefer. Need a little more depth into the characters.
3,"""The program will continue...""","""The Horns of Nimon"" is really a mixed-bag. Tom Baker and Graham Crowden play it for laughs, while Lalla Ward plays it dead straight. The serial has a real cheap feel to the production. The Nimons themselves are laughable when first seen. They look like giant cockroaches with lanky legs. Some of the sets are convincing, while others are not. Malcolm Terris as the co-pilot is wonderfully OTT. The secens where Romana lands on Crinoth are very effective. But, the supporting cast, especially the actors with no lines, lazilly sleepwalk through most of their staging. ""The Horns of Nimon"" might arguably be the worst of Season 17, but with an open mind and a few beers, this adventure might make even the most discriminating Who fan look twice."
1,"This book is not a ""how-to""","Well, I just got this book. From the Preface: ""This book is not a ""how-to"". This book is one level higher and deals with the cognitive psychological theory of designing and developing technical communication..."". Thats not what I need. I looked for ""how to' not for another academic book. Well this book is going to the return center."
5,My toddler loves this tent!,"I recently purchased this bed tent for my 2 year old to fit over his new ""big boy"" bed. It gives him a safe and secure place to sleep at night and a fun place to play during the day. It is very easy to set up and take down so it will be very portable for nights away from home. I'm very pleased!"
3,so-so,"The movie was good, but I thought it could have been better .I liked the lead actors, particularly Nicholas Turturro.. Also,what's the difference between the R-rated and unrated editions?"
3,Sorry for the bad review I sent a while ago.,"I can't find out how to delete my previous review, but it wasn't the sellers fault that made me say what I did.Charles Conklin"
2,Irish Trilogy,I did not realize that I had ordered paperback books instead of audio cd's until I received the package. The books were wrapped which was good but unusual for the cd's I get so I started to open one and noticed it was a book. I emailed the company and quickly got a response on how to return. I returned and got a delivery receipt. I still have yet to receive a refund for the order that was received back by the company on 08/13/09.
1,poor quality,"DON'T buy this printing. the quality of the print is poor. there are totally useless pages, even though michigan press said they had cleaned it up. obviously, no one even looked at it. crooked pages, splotchy print."
5,Magnificently Put Together,"A magnificently put together book that pits Dierdre & Mitch against, well, seemingly, everyone! I couldn't put this novel down--in fact, I believe I read it faster than anything I've read in quite a while.The Author really has a handle on how to manipulate her characters (as well she should after 5 previous books!) into situations that are both plausible (in her universe), and so conflicting as to cause the reader much anxiousness and anticipation in how the puzzle will be solved.I wholeheartedly recommend this book for any and all readers, and am anxiously awaiting book #7!"
3,Me parece excelente,"Me parece excelente esa cambio que la dan a la cancion de Van Halen, se oye hasta futurista, como un augurio de lo nuevo que va venir y ya esta en esta epoca. Es vanguardista. En lo personal hace 3 años que he empezado a oir este tipo de musica. Grupos como Tricky, Chemical Brothers, Underworld, The Prodigy, Massive Attack, y ustedes, han cambiado y aumentado mis ""horizontes musicales"" lo han ampliado, pues. Disculpen si escribo en español, pero el ingles todavia no lo domino.Un saludo y ojala no se desintegre el grupo y sigan invitando a varias personas para colaborar en sus producciones.Bye"
2,Not much of a novel.,"OK, I know this story first hand, literally. I was stunned by the author's grasp of the details, of his ability to state bluntly the utter banality of so many of the things American men find so irresistable about Russian women. However, the story itself is as dry as dust. Greenburg's attention to the codification of the American-man-meets-gorgeous-Russian-woman-and-falls-madly-and-irrationally-in-love story is noble, but as the relationships themselves, the story is completely lacking in literary merit. It's old hat now."
2,OK for the money,"I bought this from an online vendor for an Optura Xi and it fits and takes a charge well. However, the case on the battery is very thin and cracked after just a few months use. I'd rate this as average. I would recommend having a spare for important events."
1,This battery doesn't work,This battery refuses to charge in my ZR85 camera. I would not recommend it.
1,Buyer Be Very Wary,"The trusted leader in children's learning really blew it with this product. I bought SS Baby deluxe, SS Preschool and SS Toddler for my 2 and 4 year olds. My little girl was SO excited to play these games but Uh-oh. The small print says several of the disks DON'T WORK on Windows 2000 and they were developed for XP before the program was released so it is shaky on XP machines too. The bottom line - we can't run most of the CD's - some will install but not play. Some won't give the sound, some won't install. Very disappointing. Also Encore (who produces product) says on their web that they don't do refunds - you have to go back to the original store. Also they don't have an 800 toll-free number so you have to pay for support calls. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SESAME STREET. I WILL BE VERY WARY OF ALL THEIR PRODUCTS NOW. Amazon probably shouldn't sell this as compatible with 2000 and XP as it just doesn't work with many of those computers."
4,Great guide to finding marriage-ready men!,"If you're the type of girl who is ready to settle down and marry the guy of your dreams(like me)then this is the book for you. I've dated plenty of marriage-shy guys in the past and not ONE of them ever did anything on this list. Now I know that I've been wasting my time on guys who just aren't ready to settle down. Get this book and you'll know the secrets to finding a guy ready for marriage. I finally found my List man, now you can too!"
5,Great Guide!,I wish this book was available before I met the man of my dreams. It would have made my search a lot easier. This book gives women the power to select the correct man in an appropriate timeframe.
5,"The List - insightful, intelligent and fun!","Mary and Sheila provide insight to readers through an easy-to-follow list and real life examples. This book is great for single women stuck in a dating rut, left with unanswered questions from failed relationships. The book is also a must read for men to understand the actions they should take to avoid the frustrating world of game playing. The real life scenarios provide better understanding and add some comic relief as well. The only challenge I have is that I felt like the book is written with the premise that the female reader is actively searching for a man to wed her. I chose to read it with the perspective that the female is searching for her soulmate, not just a man that believes she is his soulmate. Good book - intelligent authors!"
4,Modern Jazz at its Best,"Colley, a respected yet underrated young lion of modern jazz, teams up with drummer Bill Stewart (of John Scofield and Pat Metheny Trio fame), guitarist Adam Rogers, and tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. The set mainly features abstract funk-based tunes, but this is not ""jam band"" music at all. Colley and Co. improvise their butts off, swinging relentlessly. Ornette Coleman's ""Alpha"" is given a fine run-through, with Stewart kicking up a storm, much as he does on the other swing vehicle, ""Barracudas."" While this CD may be a bit too abstract for some, those who enjoy modern jazz that is exploratory and very much NOT commercial would dig this."
2,Laundry Lists,"The author stresses selling your book propsal before writing the book. Perhaps this is good business advice for an experienced writer but I'm an inexperienced writer and need to write first to see what I'm going to say. The book is mostly a collection of lists tersely explained. It should have been titled, ""Selling Your Book Proposal."" I was disappointed."
3,Okay but not great,"The author has great qualifications for writing this book, but I found much of the material covered better elsewhere. I am giving it three stars anyway because for those who haven't read several books in this genre already, it will be worthwhile."
3,"Really comfortable, but needs modifications for big folks like me!","This seat is very plush and comfy. But the wood panel that forms the base is too thin and flexible. The first time I used it, it flexed under my weight, pulling the fairings off their staples. But of course, I weigh over 350 lbs, so you may not have this problem. I pulled the fairings off and covered the base panel with 3/8 inch paneling, fastened with wood screws. Then I shaped a smaller semi-circle 3/8 inch panel to fit inside the bucket rim, and fastened that onto the bottom with more screws. This made the seat much heavier and completely rigid, even with my full mass on top of it. Now it's perfect!JL"
4,Works well,This has worked well for two seasons so far without any complaints. It still looks great. The box it comes in is HUGE!
4,Great book,"The book is excellent! Of course, there are some minor translation erros but it is a very compreensive book of metal forming processes.A must have."
5,Really funny comedy...,I thought this was a great CD. A lot of stand up and some great improvisation using suggestions from the crowd.I've seen them live before and they really are a very funny duo. They are at there best when working off the crowd. Great road disk with guaranteed laughs
2,Way too expensive for what is delivered.,"The only reason I can see to purchase the silent brass system is if you have to play in a noisy environment where you have trouble hearing yourself. Then it makes sense to have the pick and ear phones. Otherwise, don't bother.The silent brass system ($119) is not silent. It is slightly quieter than a Harmon mute ($30), has more back pressure and weighs more. If you are in a room by yourself, you don't need the silent brass system. Use a cup mute or Harmon mute and save the money."
5,Absolutley wonderful!,"I love this mute system. I previously had a Jo-Ral practice mute. It was nice, but this mute is above and beyond that mute. When I play with this mute it feels like I don't have a mute in at all. It's especially nice because I live in an apartment complex where you can easily hear a trumpet through the walls. It's nice to have this because I'm not afraid of bothering the neighbors while playing. Love it!"
2,Unrealized potential,"This book is derived from a short story, with the same title, in ""Women at War"". There is plenty of material, but the novel is a major disappointment. Perhaps the assorted myths, legends, and songs sprinkled in with the story inspire false hopes. Children seem to regress as they grow up, travel times are out of alignment with distances, the war sequence is as precise as a fumbled handoff, and the finish goes splat like a bowl of macaroni salad dropped from the top of the Sears tower."
4,A gripping tale about surving the ugly side of glory.,"Vernon Baker's life is a tour through some of the worst 20th Century America had to offer: from his roots as an orphan in southeastern Wyoming, through his childhood at Father Flanagan's Boy's Town to his glory years as a war hero who fought valiantly under racist officers he despised. Yet, in Lasting Valor, Baker never becomes GI Joe -- a war hero caricature with cartoon emotions. That Baker handled life's trials with an Everyman's mixture of frustration, anger and resentment shows that Baker was a soldier -- and a man -- of remarkable courage and dignity. That we were able to learn this about him is a credit to his honesty and Olsen's reporting. This is one of the few books I've read about a great man that also taught me something about mankind."
5,Very pleased with purchase,Vernon Baker is a personal friend. He is the kindest and dearest man I know. I wanted to share his story with a friend. I have a signed copy. Thanks.
5,Sail Without an Engine,"While peppering the book with philosophical tidbits, the author imparts his immense knowledge about sailing. Every sailor should read this."
3,Interesting insights on the sailing life,"The author loves dropping opinion bombs throughout the book. Where those opinions are relevant to sailing they can be entertaining and liven up the book. Where they stray beyond the author's area of knowledge (religion, politics, evils of western culture, etc) they detract tremendously. If those rants bother you simply skip those chapters and move on to the excellent sailing related content in later chapters."
1,Little Substance - Lot's of Self Promotion,It's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting. Written with blatant self promotion in mind for other Garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added. Would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout. Truly basic and nothing new here - spend your money elsewhere.
2,Confusing!,"I had to purchase this book for an online stats course - BIG mistake! The organization of the book is so incredibly confusing, and the ""expanding the basics"" problems are not illustrated in the chapter, nor do they have answers with which to check your answers. I have taken other reasoning courses (in class and online) and they were organized much better, with relevant examples that explained every step -- perfect for anyone who is basically trying to teach him/herself! I hope mathematics teachers nationwide realize how difficult this text is for students to follow. Consider another text!"
3,"Brave writing, but the climax was a bit shaky","The characters that Poppy provides us with seem to be stupendously intelligent. I mean, expressive artist, computer hacker, wisecracking nightclub owner...what else is there to characterize? Big kudos to the author for her risky, yet successful, sex scenes, especially since the sex is gay. It was amazing to picture in my mind, even though I personally am straight and choose not to practice homosexual sex.However, there is one major problem...the end of the book was quite confusing. I had a hard time following the last few chapters. And all the good horror came in the fifth-to-last chapter.Nevertheless, it was a decently written novel, and Poppy has pretty much established herself in the fiction business."
3,"dynamic prose and drawn out dissapointment, again.","brite crafts characters with firecracker facades and little more. this novel is spoiled by the intrusion of boring and pointless sex scenes, a weak plot, and a cast of prettyboy airheads that serve as marionettes in brite's self-centered explorations of free gay sex. by the way, what was the whole deal with birdland? is this book supposed to be scary?"
2,Survivor,I was too disappointed by the book. The book is filled with many inaccuracies. Burnett is also quite harsh when it comes to the Pagong tribe. It is just surprising to me that Burnett thinks he can make an accurate description on the castaways personalities (without really knowing them). I found the book more annoying and frustrating than an entertaining read!!!
5,13 bucks was well worth it,"Guys, I am a HUGE survivor fan. I found this book to be really....................interesting. It gives you good detail behind the scenes of survivor. After reading this book, i look at Jeff Probst totally differently. He is not God, amd what's with this Chief Jeff crap? The book is good despite what other people say."
2,A little thin on excitement,"I thought this book would be a bit spicier than what can go on TV, but I found details and stories to be a bit thin. It was as though the book was an after-thought to the hit show; another piece of merchandise not quite up to snuff. Not a bad book, but I think it could have been better."
1,"A work of fiction, in my opinion.","I'm very disappointed with this book. I strongly doubt half the stuff this book discribes actually happened. Weird stuff, such as Richard having gay fantasies about Sean. The author describes one of Richard's dreams about making love to Sean in detail... how was he able to know what Richard was dreaming? Because Richard told Sean about it? I don't believe it.There are other things... the author talks about how the Pagong tribe had no respect and were all phony. Mark Brunnet's personal bias against certain contestants makes me wonder if the show really was rigged, or if the producers did sway the votes to get the outcome they wanted. Either way, the show was entertaining but this book was horrible. Get Stingray instead."
2,Help me Survive,"I was really hoping for more of a behind the scenes kind of feel. I loved the show and was eagerly awaiting the chance to know about the things they could not show on TV. The fact that there are no captions for the photos is sad. The book mentions how ""Chief Jeff"" and the production crew want to make life harder for Pagong, but there is no explanation of how this is done. There is just not enough explanation all around. I have to say I am very disappointed in this book (but it was quick to finish at least) and am now eagerly awaiting the tell alls by Jenna, Colleen and the rest (although, not Richards). I will even wait 3 years."
2,A Dog's Breakfast,"Perhaps I have become spoiled by eminent historians such as Simon Schama, Martin Gilbert, William Manchester, Stephen Ambrose or Ian Kershaw, but I confess to not being able to digest this turgid piece of work. The author is so bogged down in a morass of detail that he looses any sense of the sweep of history. Names of people and places pop up like ducks in a shooting gallery, and promptly disappear without our having understoood why they were referred to in the first place. The subject is admittedly difficult, but the author is clearly not up to the task of sorting it out for us."
1,Still censored.... no thanks,"Until we get an uncut version of ROTLD 3 this is a waste of a compilation. Not to mention Bride of Re-Animator is still censored like the release Lionsgate put out years ago. Do yourself a favor & try to pick up the Pionner release of Bride. Both versions included & great extras. For now I'll stick with my uncut VHS of ROTLD 3 & Pioneer copy of Bride. PS... this collection is only 2 discs, NOT 6 discs like amazons specs say. They have a habit of posting false info."
4,compact hand-held multi-language for the traveler,This is a good buy for the price. I have a copy of the Rick Steve's three-language guide for the traveler. I bought this as a supplement to the book. The translator comes with an instruction pamphlet which I keep with it. I have found the translator will take time to use without the pamphlet. It is compact and contains basic information for five languages. It should be a valuable aid for any trip to Europe.
3,Not his best work,"Fiend has yet to release an album that matches up with ""There's One In Every Family"". This album brings back memories from his days at No Limit. With production by DJ KLC and some familiar names I bought this album. I am personally happy with the selection, though it lacks the hard hitting sound I expect from Fiend. I will just continue to wait for the release of DJ KLC new album"
2,A great idea but....,"I loved the idea of having a rod AND sorter bags to transfer clean laundry from the dryer to the bedrooms. Unfortunately this product is not well made enough to do that. When I first put it together, it was a little wobbly but once I really tightened the screws it was OK. But now that I have been using it for 4 months or so it is loose again and tightening the screws has not helped. Also the wheels have a very hard time rolling on carpet or turning corners. When I try to lift the cart to get it over the bump between the tile and carpet, the wheels fall off and they are a pain to put back on especially with a full cart. The sorter is just one big piece but it would be much easier if each of the bags was easily removed so I could take laundry out of it without having to move the whole cart. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone. It is just not very easy to use."
3,good for little people with short clothes,"The verticle space between the canvas laundry bags is too short to hang my husbands shirts, full length pants, or my window curtains, but holds my tops and other small items okay. The baskets on the top and on the bottom are way too flimsy to hold clothes or bedding, but my kittens like to play on the bottom one. The canvas bags slide off of the bars, have no covers, and are awkward to unload. Other than that it's great. Oh yeah, and i never could get the wheels to stay on."
5,Originals got nothing,"Well, I got to listen to the remixes first, which makes the view completely different. When I listened to the original it wasn't even half as cool. I'd say just get the remixes, the originals just can't compare."
5,Finally This Great Show is on DVD,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Season 1 and I'm happy to say that it has been worth the wait. The remastered episodes look brand new and the sound quality is awesome. The show's high production values and great sets take this series a step above many others at the time. I can't wait for Season Two to come out on DVD October 25, 2005. This is a must have for any Doris fan, and in these days and times when most tv is crap, these shows are a welcomed relief."
5,One for the entire family!,"If you like good, decent, family-oriented DVD's, this is one to buy, keep and share! Not only Doris, but all the actors do a great job! I was sorry when I had viewed the last episode!"
2,Save your money you have to be a HUGE Doris Day fan to buy this!!,"to start I am a very big fan of Doris Day for yeays. I had just bought the 6 DVD box set of her movies & loved that so I decided to buy this TV series. It is so awful words can't describe it. It's not because it's ""dated"" because I Love Lucy is alot older & sheer perfection. It's initially nice to see Doris in another genre but this first series just doesn't work for me for many reasons. The subject matters chosen are thoughtful(that's the reason I gave it TWO stars & the presence of Doris)..I'll tell you the show just bored me & I found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes.the DVD extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting. There's NO new interviews with Doris(that's an old interview they put on there).I think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dogs"
5,fits like...,"...a glove!Well designed and thought out - once it's on, it stays put and doesn't fall out. The space age material doesn't wear out in my purse, but it keeps the surface of my expensive phone protected from scratches and make-up stains. I've had people ask me where I got my case because they thought it was the neatest one they've ever seen. Body Glove makes all the right cuts so that speakers, charging apparatus and head sets can be accessed with no difficulty. A great investment in protecting your investment!"
4,Shin adjusts to his parasyte...,"In this the 4th installment of the Parasyte series, our hero Shin begins to adjust to his pal lefty, and even begins to show cruelty-- enough to scare sara. He also discovers that the new kid at school, one Hideo Shimada, is more than he seems....Another great book in a great series! Bloody and violent with deep emotion and feeling, great black and white artistry and an involving story, this is one that manga fans shouldn't miss!"
4,Good at teaching you how to hammer with a screwdriver,"Perl is not an object-oriented language by nature. Perl-heads will debate this with me ad infinitum, but the truth is, Perl 5 added references and a few key words to allow users to mimic what other languages gracefully implement. Conway's book is good, detailed, and rich, but nonetheless its topic matter is fractured.If you are forced into using Perl in this manner (as I have been on large projects) then this reference is indispensible. Better advice though, would have been to simply go with Python, which is not so nearly hostile to OO techniques as Perl."
2,"""Official"" does NOT = Quality","It is unfortunate that a federal judge agreed with Toho and protected Random House's shoeshine. The unofficial 227-page Godzilla book has been kept off the market by the all-powerful federal judiciary. Even now, the copies gather dust in a warehouse. The only consolation is that the grosses of GODZILLA are as pathetic as Toho's efforts."
1,Corny,"can't believe this Song got so much hype? wow taking the Disco Version of ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" which Walter Murphy used for ""Saturday Night Fever"" Soundtrack still Sounds like a crazy Gimmick then as now.this Cat has no Feeling in His Singing either but having the Right Last Name goes a long way."
5,An easy fix for low upper floor signals.,"My son was having difficulty staying online and getting a decent signal. This antenna gave him a much stronger signal immediately, with no dropouts."
2,Not reliable,"The problem with this adaptor is that if you walk around, the plug+adaptor assembly is so bulky that it puts a lots of stress on the connections and tend to connect and disconnect (electrically) while you walk.Seidio Stereo Adapter for Treo 700w/650/600 that I found at treonauts.com is way better. It relieves the mechanical stress with a little wire. [although this adapter requires me to plug in my headphones only halfway, I can do that](One day I hope palm just adds a regular headphone jack to the treo.)"
4,"Works well, should have bought 2; should have bought over a year ago","Works well, but sometimes I think the adapter will snap off, given the small diameter of the plug into the Treo. It's okay if you just set up in your car or on your desk, but probably not so good in your pocket.Should have bought 2 so I could leave one in the car. Or, it would be better if they had a 2-pack w/ a discount. Same goes w/ SD memory cards. The phone can do so much more w/ just these 2 accessories."
5,Like the product,"I like Campsuds because it seems as if the bugs don't like me much after I use the product, and I actually like the smell. I learned not to order liquid items online unless shipping is free, though."
5,If you like MAPS - these are great,"We first used Michelin maps in 1985...tracing our journey on all the main and back roads so as we planned our 2012 trip we were happy to see that they are still in print.One drawback is- they are BIG. But in reality this is a plus, as you have all the detail you need.Definitely consider these - saves you time and perhaps data usage time on your smartphone's GPS! Enjoy.We also purchased and used Scotland map and Northern England, The Midlands from Amazon."
5,Extraordinary recording,"This Jimmy Giuffre trio was not as neglected when the recording here under review appeared as it suddenly became. For one thing, Giuffre was an acknowledged important jazzman because of his work in other contexts. But this recording established him as a highly individualised and inventive talent, on clarinet, tenor, and baritone, each of which he played with mastery, ease, elegance, and great beauty. His tone and suggestiveness on clarinet are especially miraculous. The absence of a drummer is in many ways a blessing, as it allows those who play to be heard the better, and in some respects the swing is more easily felt than if someone had been there to accentuate it! - Joost Daalder"
3,Didn't Quite Work for Me,"This novel received several starred reviews at the time it was published, and I like stories in which a mystery from the past is solved in the present, so I thought I would like this one. As it turns out, I didn't actually dislike this book, but I never warmed up to either the story or the way in which it was told. Somehow the past just wasn't made compelling enough for me, nor was the present. Neither the story nor the characters grabbed me."
2,"Inoffensive, yet of little grace","I am not a huge fan of Billy Collins, I have read Picnic, Lighting and enjoy some of its finer moments. Here, as in elsewhere, Collins is an acessible poet, a funny poet, and, in some ways, the ideal popular poet. While is no Joyce Klimer, he is also not Charles Simic, not Anne Sexton, not Creely, and most definitely not a Charles Olson. Nine Horses is sentimental and essentially bloodless. Here Collins seems to let the subtle sublime of some of his earlier work slip more firmly into the realm of merely clever. As Collin's popularity increases he becomes poetry's Neal Simmon, or even, its Terry Pratchett. Admirable for moderns of clarity and wit, but ultimately artless. Perhaps, that best represents the taste of modern America. Many may enjoy this book, but I most definitely didn't."
1,Terrible CD,"The things that made the last album great are missing here. 1. The beats aren't as great. 2. They lost an MC. 3. The great artists featured are gone. 4. the content is all the same.I didn't like the lyrical content at all to begin with, but the genius of the production made me want to listen. I still have Violent By Design in my heavy ratation. So now we have over a dozen tracks of Vinnie Paz telling us how crazy, mad and anti-semetic he is. And it's not counterpoint to Jus Allah who's style made Vinnie sound more impressive. Before, where Vinnie changed his flow from track to track, now it's all the same. An MC screaming over a track, not flowing well with the music, talking about offensive subjects on beats that aren't ground breaking. Doesn't sound like a good CD to me. And it won't to you either. If you like Stoupe's production, go get the Canibus' CD ""Rip the Jacker"" Produced by Stoupe and you'll hear better rhyme skills, better content and an overall better CD."
5,"Minus Jus Allah, JMT still delivers...","This CD is just as classic as ts predecessor, Violent By Design. While Stoupe's beats have more of a world music tone to them, they're as fly as ever.Vinnie Paz is still trying to kick it gangsta, but his lyrics deliver better than any mainstream act out today, metaphors and all. Every guests MC rips it just as well, if not better.I'd have to say there's only one or two tracks here that i don't favor, but every track is bound to be an underground classic.Favorite tracks include:Animal Rap, Nada Cambia, Blood In Blood Out, Kublai Khan, Walk With Me, Raw Is War 2003, and all of the bonus tracks at the end.For some of the best in REAL gangsta rap today (even though those artists don't really exist anymore), go pick this up."
2,Big disapointment,"I am listening to psycho social cd as i write this, and there is simply no comparison. Vinny paz was once a talented mc, now he is just poor and more like 50 cent with each new release. I was really expecting so much more from one of my favourite groups, but this is nothing on their previous albums, both production and rap wise. Dunno what went wrong, hope jedi mind tricks don't become another group who start amazingly and then trail off into a self destruction."
3,Dissapointing,"Im going to begin this with my praises for violent by design. Brilliant. When listened on a playlist alongside Visions of Ghandi, it seems equally brilliant. This album was just dissapointing.All of the previous reviews state that Vinnie Paz has regressed to juvenile insults and horror-style raps, and it is true. THough showing some signs of his prior excellence, he has fallen off in a very dissapointing way.However, the primary weakness of this album is not in Vinnie Paz's lyrics, but in the beats. Flat out, they are out-of-character for JMT, and arent as hot as VBD.Don't sleep on these tracks though:-Tibetan Black Magicians (high energy and great cameos)-The Rage of Angels (The chorus and beat are haunting, and Vinnie Paz features a mellow flow in contrast to his usual angry raps)-The Wolf (Once again, great cameos by Ill BIll and Sabac, and a original, hot beat)Im still gonna cop the next JMT, but won't hold my breath"
4,not a great album but still better then most,"i really can't argue with alot of the reviews trashing the lyrics on this album, but if you think these beats aren't bad-ass there is something wrong with you. it seems to me that stoupe was just experimenting with some incredible spanish samples that make the album worth buying. As for Vinnie Paz, there were alot of times that i thought he was falling off but he comes back to prove me and all his critics wrong(Legacy of Blood, 5 stars), and he said it himself in an interview that this was the first album he recorded in new york and it affected his lyrics. So i suggest that if you love stoupe like i do then get this album or any Jedi album(all 5 stars except this one). Or In my opinion one of the best hip hop cds of all time Canibus - Rip the Jacker."
2,Paz is the problem,"I don't know what happened to this group. Psycho-Social is one of my favorite discs both lyrically and musically. Stoupe still proves he's one of the best producers in hip hop, but Vinnie Paz's violent Muslim rhetoric has got to go. I have a hard time believing the man who once rapped ""I chose to be enclosed and I fold too, like origami / Comprehend the theory of reflection like Parmatma / In the epic Sanskrit history of the world like Mahabharata / Praise to His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada"" is now only capable or writing drivel like ""I'm like Mussolini, I rule with a iron fist / I stab you in the bladder with a dagger and watch you die in piss"". Time for Stoupe to step out on his own and start working with some worthwhile MCs.My issue isn't really that they're violent, it's that there's no creativity behind the violence. And he seems to have lost all semblance of flow, he really just shouts now."
4,Great introduction for SPEAKING Portuguese,It is a bit slow (boring) but the constant repetition really helps you remember. You are not memorizing but actively participating in a thirty minute conversation.You will speak without much of an accent and sound like you are from Rio.The vocabulary is small but the structure of the language is there so you can insert new words as you learn them.The hardest part of learning is a language is speaking it and this programs works well on that part.I went on to learn all of Phase 2 and I am currently working on Phase 3.
4,What I did to make it grate for direct cooking,"I was wondering if the grate could be used for direct cooking because the picture and description did not mention that it was. From other people's comments regarding the painted surface, I thought just to be on the cautious side with products from our eastern friends, I would add a procelain grid made for direct cooking. I used a grate for Char-Broil 7000/8000 which measures 14/3/4 by 24. I used a bit of bare copper wire as twist ties to attach it. Now it has a non-stick surface."
1,Worst antenna I ever had...,I bought this antenna base on all the good reviews I've read. Big mistake! I couldn't get any clear channels from this thing. My unpowered rabbit ear out-performed it by a mile. And the size! it has the wing span of an albatross. Total waste of money.
3,Placebo,Can't say this product did any better than the rabbit ear I had on the TV before. It did even out the channels as far as reception goes on the digital side but does a poor job of picking up regular broadcast signals.
2,Not for city living,"This antenna did not work for me. Granted, I live in an urban area. But I did not pick up one consistent channel. It's also very directional, so even if you live in the country, you have to continually change the direction based on what channel you'd like to watch. Pay a little extra for a higher quality, more powerful antenna."
1,Better off with a coat hanger,"I spent 50 bucks on one of these to try to cure my TV problem with 6 fuzzy channels off my roof aerial. Everybody I asked said they were wonderful. I put on the Terk, and only got 2 fuzzy channels instead. I took it back to the shop the same day. Enough said."
5,By Far The Best Antenna You Can Buy,I tried many others and they brought in ZERO signals. With this antenna I get all of the signals in the air and I am facing the OPPOSITE direction from the transmitters. In my opinion there is no other antenna that works like this model does.NOTE: I use mine on its SIDE facing OUT on top of a narrow 1 foot square box sitting on the window sill against the window or screen NOT horizontally like they show it. Like in Windmill position not helicopter position. VERY IMPORTANT. Do not use Helicopter position. Put in Window sill in Windmill position and rotate like a windmill to tune reception.
1,not worth it,It could not get reception even though I live across the street from a television station. My broken ugly rabbit ears receives 10X better picture.
1,Returned due to poor performance,The signal wasn't much better when compared to a $10 cheap antenna. The picture quality for channels in the UHF range were specially affected. Returned it after a couple of days of testing.
3,Fantastic reception. Great antenna.,"Phenomenal antenna. We tried the RCA indoor un-amplified antenna and found complete digital reception failure. I went up to best buy to browse, checked the open box section for deals, and found this beauty for $25. What a deal! Fantastic reception for our area, and forgiving positional requirements for great reception.Edit: This antenna was great at the time, but it quickly became obsolete. I no longer have it and just bought a Leaf antenna. It is excellent thus far. I'd recommend the Terk for under $20."
5,Terk Antenna,I bought the Terk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5)to use with my iMac and EyeTV to capture HD programming. The antenna has worked wonderfully to pull in around a dozen HD channels along with a host of analog channels. It's unobtrusive and actually quite attractive.
2,Not all that great.,"I ordered this indoor antenna due to the great reviews. I was very disappointed by its performance. I was able pull in a two of channels located at 6 mile range with snow and ghosting (analog). Same two channels in digital format with signal strength 15-45% with very much freeze and hicups. Other channels located within 40 mile range didn't not come up at all. No matter what anybody says NO indoor antenna will not pull in channels within a 20-40 mile range, unless you live in a secluded area where there are no trees, no other buildings and the whether condition is clear and I wouldn't count on it giving you the picture you most likely want either."
4,boost in power,Well in reading the other profiles- I must say that they might have installed the TV-5 wrong- In the beginning- I thought reception was poor compared to the rabbit ears that I had before- I adjusted and the reception became better- What you need to do is slide the amplification to MAX and then you get more channels and much better reception compared to the rabbit ears- After I boosted power - I was quite happy to get better reception than before- including channels I never got. So I am a happy customer.
2,"No better than other antennas, and they weren't great","Without any antenna, I got most of the broadcast channels, most of them are very grainy and sometimes very ghosty. The TV5, even with its built-in amplifier, did not improve reception much, one channel became very clear, the others actually developed more ghost images, and an extra, WB, was pulled in - also quite grainy. Overall, the pluses and minuses cancelled each other out.I live in downtown Seattle, surrounded by buildings on all sides, but I'd hoped for more improvement. The performance of this antenna was no better than a cheaper one like the Jensen 631. That one also had exactly the same effects."
1,"net10 service good, but product never delivered","Net10 offers a decent service, but never sent a card when i purchased from amazon. eventually amazon refunded. Don't buy from here!"
1,It sucks,Dosen't work we are not suppose to hear the whistle the dogs are.I would not advise this product for anyone it dosen't work. it works like a real whistle like a coach whistle not a dog whistle.
1,not approved for use by safety inspectors,"I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one."
3,Trouble with car seat straps,"When I first purchased this item, my child was still small enough that the car seat straps were threaded through the lowest holes in the car seat. The ""bundle me"" uses velcro to fit around the car seat straps and this would prevent the straps from tightening properly! I took it out of the car seat for safety reasons. Now that my child is older and the straps are threaded through the top holes, there is no problem, because the straps can thread into the ""bundle me"" above the velcro. Beware! This could be a serious safety issue."
4,Bundle me,"Has worked well for me. Still need a hat during cold weather, but otherwise works for basic back and forth travel. Not really good for extended trips outside in cold weather w/o coat and hat."
5,Wonderful product!,This product is so convenient and easy to manage. It's also very warm. It's kept our baby girl warm through a Minnesota winter. It's so much easier than wrestling with a snow suit and seat belt ever time you go somewhere.
3,Shoulders Not Covered,"Our baby hated his pram, so I thought this would be a good alternative for the not so cold days (fall) to ride next door to Grandma's or up to the bus stop with his sister. He definately took to it a lot better. However, I was dissapointed that there is no way to keep above the baby's chest or above covered. Our baby was 5 1/2 months when I started using this. He is able to pull it down off the top half of him self. There should be some mechanism to hold it up. It covers him from the waist down. It's probaby great for younger babies!"
3,"great idea, could use improvement","This product would be perfect if it had a snug-fitting hood. I use the bundle-me when I'm running from the car to a store and back again. I really wish that this could be redesigned to prevent the cold air from streaming in by the neck, while at the same time baby is starting to sweat by the feet."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was very disappointing to me. I simply bought it to get a better understanding of ID and compare it to what we know about evolution. It failed my expectations for a variety of reasons.First, the author spent far too much time on the ""persecution"" of ID supporters. Very boring.Second, the author attacks a few of the commonly known oddities and unexplained phenomena of evolution to ultimately conclude that the entire theory is fatally flawed. (The author says that evolution is not even a sound theory.)Third, maybe it was me, but it felt like there was very little evidence presented to support ID. The one theme I felt like I read over and over was this: if scientists cannot explain it, and if it seems too complex to have evolved, it must have been created by some ""intelligent designer.""There are better books out there on this subject."
2,Disappointed ID Supporter,"This books was extremely disappointing (for a variety of reasons) especially considering that I had thoroughly enjoyed Well's previous book, Icons of Evolution. The book is disorganized and seems to have been thrown together quickly for the PIG series. Another serious problem I have with this book is the packaging, amrketing, etc. which would lead one to believe that ID is for conservatives. Ann Coulter, on the cover of the book, recommends its purchase by saying ""Annoy a godless liberal, buy this book."" David Limbaugh, another far right conservative, gives a recommendation on the back cover. As a progressive liberal and ID supporter, I find it offensive that ID is often marketed to the most right wing of conservatives. The truth is that many liberals, both religious and non-religious support ID. Why don't Wells and other prominent members of the ID community recognize this and be more neutral when it comes to the political side of things."
1,Lying to the choir,"The title of the book does not do it justice. Not only is it politically incorrect, it is scientifically, factually, logically, academically and morally incorrect.Once again Jonathan Wells has clearly outlined that Intelligent Design is nothing but a series of well refuted ""negative evidence"" for evolution. For those that disagree, when you read this book, please try to find one piece of evidence FOR design. Let's assume for a moment that evolution is actually false - now please tell me what Intelligent Design predicts. One scientifically testable prediction is all I ask.It is telling to see these arguments hammered out in the popular press. I am all for legitimate scientific debate - it is what science thrives on. However, when scientists have a genuine debate they argue in peer reviewed journals, not popular books."
4,This book definately opens the lines of communication!!!,"This book was great for my boyfriend and I. He was the type that thought he knew it all, much to his surprise he realizes there is more than bedroom sex. It began the wheels of intamacy turning and they have not stopped yet. Some of the games are basic but they also give new ideas to old games, and it touches on some ""forbidden"" areas that alot of people would have difficulty talking about without the book as an aide. It opens the doors to excitiment and fun."
2,Didn't last,I bought these for my class to use on lapboards. We have used them about four times and half of them are not working any more.
1,The markers don't work well.,The markers don't work well. They write like they're dried out; you could barely see the text/writing. These are going back.
3,Nice size but color does fade...,"I liked these markers cause they are a decent size for normal writing and they work well on different dry erase surfaces such as a dry erase calendar, tile memo board and a glass memo board. My complaint though is that the writing will fade and I did not experience this with the EXPO brand, so you may want to try them if you are writing and want something to stay brilliant in color. Also, found the green and red colors to be very light. Maybe I got a bad pack, but I have found with other brands also that sometimes only the black shows well. Personally I wouldn't recommend this product though what I did like was the ability to write on several types of surfaces and the smaller tip size."
3,same old tired girl thing,nothing interseting just a bunch of girls trying to fill in tlc's shoes this is for really young high school girls going through that teenage drama.
3,Sometime criticism is hard to take.,"Art criticism is more often than not, very dry. This book was no exception. I was expecting more of a biography but while there was some biographical information, it was mostly a collection of articles of art criticism about Georg Bazelitz' paintings. I got through it, but as reading, it was difficult to take. The pictures were nice though, and that made it tolerable. I am keeping the book, but just for the pictures."
3,Seemed Useful,"It seemed like it would be a very good resource and it was in wonderful condition. I switched classes, so I no longer needed the book."
4,nice but really long,"Loved the costume. I'm 5'5"" and wear a size 14 it fit really well a little tight around the arms. The only bad thing was it was about 6 inches to long I had to have it taken up a little so I wouldn't be tripping on it. But it is a very nice costume!"
3,Very beautiful...but....,This outfit runs small...I am a size 10 and I ordered this in a Large because I was scared it would be kind of small...but I think an XL would have fit a little better. It also has a cord that runs through the bottom of the slip that I had to take out several times for the skirt to stand out. It is a very beautiful dress though!!!
3,Not so regal Queen of Hearts,"I had to pay 25 extra pounds for custom release which I was not told about when I purchased it. When the dress arrived I thougtht the packaging was good but when I took the dress out, two of the seams where ripped and one seam was frayed. The lace collar would not stand up and the hoop which came with the dress would not go into a circle but kept going into a spiral despite numerous attempts from different people including a material shop porprieter to insert it into the underskirt, so as well as having to pay for the customs charge I had to have the dress mended and buy a hoop. Although everyone at the fancy dress party thought the dress was amazing if I had known all the extra expence, time and stress it caused me I would not have bought it"
1,VERY CONFUSING AND HARD TO DO,tHIS IS NOT FOR ME. IT HAS TOO MANY CONFUSING PLAYS!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT. I LIKE MY OLD CD OF THIS BETTER.
5,Scrabble~a~holic,"I have always been a scrabble fan. This computer game gave me the upper hand in a lot of the ""competition"" rounds with my mother :). So for Christmas, I got her one too! She's addicted already and it's gonna be a challenge to try to outword her now for sure!"
1,Does not work with Zone Alarm antivirus,When starting this game with Zone Alarm activated the screen goes black. Even with all permissions given the same problem occurs. Infogrames should create a patch to take care of this.
1,Wish I could really review Scrabble INcomplete,"Am unable to play the game. It loaded okay, but every time I either clickled ""play"" or double-clicked on the Scrabble shortcut icon, the screen went to black and locked up the computer. Had to do a hard boot every time. Investigated the website for troubleshooting and was greeted with suggestions that I didn't really want to try, like reconfiguring this and that, disabling running programs like virus scan, etc. Tried calling the non-tollfree number at a time when I should have been able to talk to a person, and only got routed thru Menu Land. Twice my call was disconnected. Never talked to anyone. The automated ""advice"" was the same as the website's. I have Windows Me if that's any hint for any of you more dauntless than I am. BEWARE!! Stick with the board game and a friend."
1,Scrabble Complete does NOT work for XP,"Sorry, we have prior Scrabble games, and recently purchased this version. No, it does NOT work for XP, it DOES work for Windows 98 and 2000. Do not buy it if you are an XP user."
1,No improvement,"I'm unimpressed with this new version of Scrabble. It looks nearly exactly like v2.0 (and only has one additional mini-game). More problematically, the game still runs full screen -- why can't I buy a Scrabble game that lets me play in a reasonably-sized window?? Also, like previous versions, you have to have the CD in your drive to play -- annoying for those of us who want to play on our notebook computers."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"Marc Anderson's review below hits the nail on the head. This is possibly the most useless TV tool and/or calibration tool that has ever been marketed. It is about as high tec as a plastic pair of 3-D glasses and about as useful also. When you buy a calibration disc you are not interested in someone's singing career or her ""cutsy"" expressions about calibration. This really is a disc that explains the 4-5 basic components of TV calibration whilst leaving the viewer hanging at the point where more info. is necessary. It may be helpful to someone who has not owned a color TV in the last 45 years but otherwise there is no value added. It is certainly easy to use because there is nothing really to use. Absolutely terrible!"
2,Good for the simple minded,"This DVD is okay. It does what it advertises, but there are much better calibration DVDs out there. This DVD doesn't contain any audio calibration, which is what I also wanted. Some of the calibration on the DVD is too subjective for my taste. I really thought the music video at the end was rather pointless. If you're a guy with a short attention span, this DVD will probably work for you.I found that ""The AVIA Guide to Home Theater"" DVD was much better. The AVIA DVD provides much less subjective calibration. It contains audio calibration. It contains suggestions on the types of cables to use, and other helpful suggestions for setting up your home theater. The only downside of the AVIA DVD was that it wasn't widescreen, unlike this widescreen DVD, but in reality the widescreen video is only useful if you're too blind to notice that your aspect ratio on the TV is causing circles to look like ovals.Personally, I thought this Monster/ISF DVD was a waste of my money."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I purchased this item even after reading all the negative feedback and I must say, I do regret ordering. This DVD is very basic and not worth the money. I found the Disney WOW CD much better then this one.Save your money and listen to those who have taken their time to write a feeback.Peace."
2,Monster/ISF HDTV Calibration Wizard DVD,"This was not all the helpful. After changing my settings to what this DVD recommended, the picture on my TV was worse than before I started. I did learn what the different settings were all about and how to use them, but I found the settings per the DVD were way off. At least the price I paid for the DVD wasn't too bad."
4,"Oh, the Places You'll Go!","Do you have shoes on your feet and brains in your head? Then maybe you can go places like the little boy in the book Oh the Places You'll Go!, by Dr. Seuss. This book takes a little boy through good and bad places till he finds what he's looking for. This book has fabulous pictures that pop out in the story when you read it! They describe the characters moods also! When the character is happy then the pictures are colorful and bright colors. However, when the character is sad or mad the pictures are gloomy and dull colors. When I first read this book I thought about how it related to my life. Well my parents always told me that I could go great places if I have a good education! If you read this book I bet it could bring back some memories from the paste to! This book also relates to real life and has a great message in it! But don't sit her and give the whole thing away, READ IT!"
5,wow,"I picked this up after reading some reviews on this site. Let me tell you, I just want to say thank you to all the Knapsack fans that said to go get this album. I coudn't stop listening to it. They are just so good. From start to finish I was feeling the magic. If you like the get up kids and saves the day, you won't be disappointed. So stop reading the reviews and purchase the album."
1,THIS IS NOT EMO,"Man, I like real emo bands like the Ataris and NFG [...] I noticed it said something about Knapsack to I bought this and it sucks. It's not catchy at all. It has no lyric sheet at all. That angers me cause I really don't know what Blair Sheehan is trying to say anyway. But what I can make out it just pretty stupid. I don't know, I would just prefer real emo like Fenix Tx and Good Charlotte. Go Wheatus!!!!"
5,sugahill,I remember when this album first came. The first track was Can't Stop. They used to play that a lot in the clubs. But the best song was Ready or Not. To this day i remember where i was when i first heard this song. All the women loved this song. It is sad but they just don't make music like this anymore. After7 can sing with the best of them. Kevon has a voice and vocal range that can match babyface. I wish I could go back in time and relive this album. This is a must have.
4,"Great set, Amazon your shipping stinks...",Got this set when it was on sale for a rediculous price. Product is great for the price.Amazon wraped it in cardboard and shipped it. It arrived with half the cardboard missing. Being a level I was upset and asked for a replacement which they sent. Packaged the same way and arrived in a similar manner. They wanted me to send the original back. It would have cost me more to buy the box and ship it back than to send me a new one.
4,Great shoes!!,"Have to say Skechers have so far been my favorite brand. Had another pair of skechers before I bought the Energy 2. And have so far been the best shoes I've owned. I stand on my feet for 10+ hours a day several days a week, and these have made it a cake walk."
3,ok,Why the heck do I have to write areview? They aren't paying me jackto utilize my literary skills. Ifyou want this thing then just orderit.
3,Nonstick wears out unfortunately,"These pans were billed as ""professional"". Unfortunately, if used as a pro might use them, that is on a regular basis, the ""autograph"" nonstick will lose its effectiveness in less than three years. I plan on trying to take my piece back or send it back to Meyer. I will report back on the response. Its too bad, because I really liked the pan, but who knows maybe the latest ""autograph"" is a bit better."
2,Peeling after a couple years,"Although I ONLY hand washed these pots and pans, somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd year, the nonstick coating on the pans started lifting. I also do not use metal cooking utensils.All that being said, I still use these pots and pans (been almost 5 years now).Overall, I originally bought this set for ~$300 5 years ago. The pots are still in excellent condition. If I was looking for pots and pans, I would consider purchasing another set at $150.I do cook a lot (used for business) so my 5 years with these pans may equate to 7-10 years of normal use."
2,Too hot to touch -- old Analon was better,"We had analon for over 10 years - real workhorses. Things were dropped, broken and scratched over the years, so these were meant as a replacement. Out of the box, the surface is great and the feel is good, but the handle and lid get too hot! I've never seen anything like that for this kind of money. Very disappointing."
4,Good Pans,So far we have had the Anolon cookwear for 3.5 months and they are working great! Best pans I've ever had
2,owned and used everyday for 3 years,"I am now looking for new cookware. I have used this cookware for three years almost everyday, and it has not heald up like it should. My mom and aunt had this same brand for 12 years, so I bought the same brand it has not held up like theres. I am now going to buy stainless steel. It is supposed to be healthy for you!"
5,The Best - EVER,My In-Laws purchased these pots and pans as a gift to me three years ago. I love to cook and use at least one of these pots everyday. I also - at times have cooked on high heat. These pots and pans are still holding strong! I have never had any of the coating come off. Nothing sticks to these pots and pans. Love them! Best Christmas gift EVER!Now - I will admit - I have NEVER used metal utensils in them and they have NEVER seen the inside of a dishwasher - but with those two things being said - they have held up so well!
3,Was expecting more,"Should be a 5 star product but is let down by- stay cool handles that don't stay cool,- cool non stick inside, but easy mark outside!- lids that steam up (okay not major!)I'd still recommend these as I don't see anything better on the market for the same price."
3,Not that great.,"The story on this is great and some of the songs are kinda catchy, but this album just falls flat to me. I've never been a fan of Mike P. and his production just brings this whole thing down. Like I said, some of the songs are kinda catchy, but other than the first song, none of them are actually good. Shaggy, Twiztid and Blaze make some good guest appearance's as spin offs of the classic Wizard of Oz characters. Shaggy's new solo is much better, so I suggest picking that up as oppossed to this."
5,WAY better than anybody could expect!,"If you like ICP, you will be AMAZED by this EP. I'm a juggalo from way back, and I've always loved the writing and performances of ICP, but I wouldn't ever say that they're on top of the rap game. I don't know what got into Violent J. (ok, maybe it was pot), but he's on fire here. His rhymes and flow on WOTH can stack up against any of the current hip-hop superstars. No, seriously. Incredibly catchy songs, a hilarious story, and appearances from Twiztid, Shaggy, Blaze, and ABK make this my favorite Psychopathic record to date. It really is that good!"
3,Quick Quest,"In no way can this book be considered the beginning of a standalone series. It borrows locations from the Liveship Traders trilogy, which is fine, but it also relies heavily on the events of the Farseer books, and I don't think you'd enjoy this if you hadn't enjoyed that.The page count seemed oddly high for such a direct, unconvoluted little chase-story, but the pages flew by quickly - it felt small in scope as there's only one POV."
1,Fitz STILL a big baby.,"Like a stalk of grain in a high wind, our silly protaganist still goes any which way the wind blows in this follow-up to the Farseer trilogy. Seems the only decision he's made all on his own was to hide out for years (like a big baby.) Years have passed and due to lack of any other human interaction besides another kid, Fitz remains insecure, impressionable, and easy to lead around by the nose as always. Soap-opera style interactions are also far too cheesy and predictable.Oh Hobb. You wrote 3 outstanding novels with the liveship trilogy, but this Farseer thing is atrocious. I won't be reading the rest of this trilogy, or anything else Hobb has written. Very disappointed."
2,Iced by Machine,"This machine does not make clear ice, just like your in-refrigerator does not make clear ice.Also, please read consumer reviews about function."
3,OLD SCHOOL,"HERE IS ANOTHER OLD SCHOOL CLASSIC. WHEN THE WAYANS WAS IN HIGH DEMAND- THIS MOVIE WAS OFF THE CHAIN. NOW, ITS JUST GOES DOWN IN THE VAULT...."
5,Extended Arm,"This is just an extension of your arm giving one the ability to pick fruit from unreachable heights. The Wolf Garten handle is a necesity for the picker bag to operate as a protector of fruit falling to the ground. Instead of frustration over reaching the fruit only to see it fall, the new or old bag controls the direction your own arm leads it, to prevent a serious accident to the plump and ready to eat fruit."
2,Doesn't get it done for me,"With this purchase, I'm giving up on the ""Dummies"" series. They just don't answer enough ""what if"" and ""why"" questions. It's more like reading a simplified owner's manual.I bought this book because of home networking problems. It doesn't tell me how or why networks function, worse (because it is mainly a step-by-step rehash of how to set up the network) it doesn't give me enough information to figure out why my network has become so unreliable."
5,I don't even like racing!,"This is a classic Nora Roberts book- and I loved it! The story focuses around car racing- which holds absolutely NO interest for me, yet I couldn't put this book down. That says a lot about the lure of the romance.Foxy grew up on the racing circuit, her brother is now a big racing star, and she returns to be the photographer for a story on him. She meets up with the man she once had a girlhood crush on- the financer of her brother's car, and his best friend. They discover a mutual attraction but they rub each other the wrong way.This book is sweet and I love that although the characters are beautiful and brilliant they also have flaws. I recommend picking this book up!"
5,Heart's Victory,I enjoyed reading this book - all of Nora Roberts' books are just great. I have not found another author that can write the words that hold the reader 100% and add in descriptions that fit the time and environment so that it brings the reader into the story.
3,balloon glasses,The lack of a stem is a great idea so there is less chance of knocking the glass over. These are ackward to use as they are so big around and are very thin.
4,Buy it. You deserve it.,It works. It talks( really). It even clips on to your belt so you can do other things and it will tell you when your meat is done. My friends are all impressed. Buy it right now and maybe it will be here in time for Thanksgiving.
3,Disappointed,"As far as operation of the unit, so far it seems to work well. I was really disappointed in the naming of this unit. I was expecting a truely wireless thermometer. When received there is still a wired probe. The only thing that is wireless is the receiver. I am still waiting for a company to create a thermometer with a wireless probe. Will it ever be done??"
5,"Fantastic Book about life, not just dating!","Having struggled with my sugar ""issue"" all my life, at 45, I have finally found a book that really gets it!!! I can't say enough good things about this book. Wherever you are at facing or wanting to find a solution to living in a world loaded with sugar, you owe it to yourself to buy and read this book."
4,not just a diet book,"I wanted a diet book intially, one that would be easy to do...but this is so much more. I really do have a problem with sugar...could never say no to a chocolate bar...thought people who gave up candy for lent were nuts. I'm not saying it easy...I'm still on part 2 after a month, but I can already see I feel differently about carbs and sugar. Oh and for those who don't get the point of eating a potatoes at night, all that about the glycemic index stuff...well you eat the potatoe with its skin...ie fiber is found in the skin makes all the difference...."
4,Capturing the essence of the match,"The video captured the essence of the match and was entertaining from the first point. The British commentaries fell flat, though, compared to their American counterparts."
3,Shame about length,"Great match, of course. I don't have the item yet but the product specs say it's a 3 hour DVD and the match lasted 3 hrs 45 minutes. So a great pity it's not provided in real time (as in the Federer v Sampras Wimbledon DVD). Would have made a big difference in terms of reliving the dramatic buildup and tension."
1,Terrible,"I didn't really watch this movie all the way through as I couldn't get past the super grainy video. The video is worse than VHS quality. If you don't mind the quality of the video this could very well be a good movie. As for me, I fast forward to the fight scenes and called it a day. Thank God I bought a used copy and didn't pay some of the outrageous prices some of these sellers are trying to sell this for."
4,Fact vs. Fiction,"I heard Judy Blunt read a portion from this in Great Falls, MT, and I eagerly bought the book. The writing is a notch above most of what's published today, and the story was compelling and so important. I'm younger than Ms. Blunt, but many of the same issues with women, families, and power in the West haunted my adolescence. However, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the local paper's coverage of Blunt's admission that the sledgehammered typewriter scene I'd just finished was made up. I understand how emotional truth shapes the memoir, but the scene as written leads the reader to take it as literal truth, and that's just not fair play in the realm of memoir. I still recommend the book in earnest, just not as wholeheartedly as I first wanted to."
3,missing parts,Recieved this filter assembly and missing 1 length airline tubing and connector and carbon cartridge. Supposed to be three of each and only recieved two of each.
2,informative and dull,"While the book contains a trove of interesting historical details, which could have been woven into a compelling narrative, the narration would be, I think, jarring to native English speakers and it's hard to assess the novel's merits without taking that into consideration. Language aside, the plot is at times convenient - and yes, improbable events are what make for a story, but they don't always go over well.That said, I think there's some insight to be had from reading this, even if the prose itself is lacking."
5,Decent rackets for beginers,"I bought these rackets from Genji Sports Amazon about a couple of weeks ago. The packaging and delivery was fast. I initially had worries about the quality of these brackets. Here are my analysis of these rackets after playing with both rackets for an week or so:pros+ genuine carbon fiber shaft+ titanium frame+ stringing well done+ well budgeted for beginners+ nice racket bag that holds two racketscons+ factory grip is hard and the rubber is slippery on Ti3004. Apply the overgrip included in the package for people with bigger hands.Overall, I think these rackets have decent quality and good for beginers to start enjoying badminton at an affordable price."
4,hi,I'm not going to disagree with the previous reviews of this album.. I am a strong advocate of canadian artists.. and nickelback is definitely that.. they also have talent.. of all the canadian artists i've heard in that past 2 years nickleback beats them all.. they are rockin and cool.. like a band should be.. I would recomend this albumm for anyone who likes music.. because no matter what you prefer nickelback gets you into the mood for moshing and banging your head..
4,Good album,"The Vancouver Canada based quartet deliver a solid album as usual. Has about 2 skippable tracks but the rest are good, with 1 great song. Has the deeper songs that make you think, something they are good at doing, as well as the more upbeat faster songs. As with all their releases, you won't be disappointed. Has one acoustic song which isn't the best. Not their best album to date but definately a good, solid album and a must have for their fans or fans of alternative music.#1 - 9.5 (great song)#2 - 8#3 - 8#4 - 7#5 - 7.5#6 - 7.5#7 - 8#8 - 6#9 - 8#10 - 6#11 - 4 (same as #3 but the acoustic version)Vancouver, BC, Canadacheck all my reviews"
4,small town alberta boys go big...,"Nickelback is some of the best talent to come out of Canada in a while. They're actually from a VERY small town (less than 1000 people) just east of where I live (they share a hometown with NHL Hall of Famer Lanny McDonald). I saw these guys live with Creed, and the hype is true... they are as good or better live as they are on CD. This band should inspire all small time garage bands to work hard, you just might get your big break."
1,be careful,"before buy it, use amazon.com look inside at In Denial: Historians, Communism, & Espionage - John Earl Haynes; Hardcover"
5,Best Version!,"I had the older version for years from Hendrickson and even the Baker version, but this one is larger, and has excellent cross referencing. I recommend it highly and would welcome a updated version with non roman numerals."
3,Still work to be done with PKI,"While Planning for PKI is a well written book, after reading I still am not sure how it all fits together. I bought the book to learn more about PKI and chose this book because previous references rated this as the best book available on PKI. After reading this book I know a little more about PKI, but this book did not ""de-mistify"" PKI for me."
4,Dry is better.,I had the old style K&N oiled filter before. This is much better. Pick up the bottle of cleaner with your order as you probably won't find it local.
3,Okay for last minute or back up.,"I bought because of the price and needed a quick fix. It actually sucks up quite a bit, but the dust and grime just packs onto that filter and when you empty the cup, you have to pull off the hair and gunk from the filter... gross! Kind of messy. Bagless vacuums are such a hit now...but I don't see why! I'd rather buy bags than inhale or touch the dust inside when it's time to empty!"
3,Apartment Vac,"This vacuum is long gone, but I found it while reviewing a different vacuum so I'm reviewing this one. When my mom first moved into her mostly carpeted 2 bedroom apartment she needed a vacuum. So we went to a couple of stores (to buy other things for her apt) and while at Big Lots we saw this vacuum for $30 and decided to buy it. We got it home and vacuumed really well, but when we went to empty it the canister wouldn't latch back on. We managed to get it to hold in by wedging a rubber thing inbetween the vacuum and canister. That was her vacuum until purchasing aDirt Devil M085590RED Featherlite Bagged Upright Vacuum Cleaner. She kept this and it ended up sitting in a closet until eventually she just threw it out."
4,Wealthy and Wise,"Have you ever heard the term,""It is not what you make, but what you keep?"" Jesse Brown shows his readers that it does not matter if you earn $30,000 or $300,000, you must pay yourself first to achieve financial success. His basic formula for maximum growth is time + consistency + interest. Mr. Brown builds upon this simple formula to show African Americans how to achieve and maintain wealth.PAY YOURSELF FIRST is a reader friendly financial planning guide. At the end of each chapter there are short quizzes for the reader to gauge their understanding of the material covered. I found this to be very helpful as the subject of finance can be confusing. The book also doubles as a workbook with a section for readers to put what they have learned into action. After reading this book, I felt empowered to take charge of my financial success and become an investor and not just a saver.Reviewed by Aiesha Flowersof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
3,"Good introduction to personal finance, but....","This book is a good introduction to personal finance. It makes one think about how they are handling their money and gives new perspectives on what should be done with money to be more prosperous. That's great, but I wish the book would give more detailed instruction on how to get started. If one is looking for help in getting started on a budget and finding ways to help manage their money to start saving and investing, they will need another book to illustrate that process more clearly."
3,Meh,"Not bad by any means, but not that memorable. I watched it once a couple years ago and have not been tempted to go back for round two. If you are an anime fan, the volume and quality of titles on Netflix makes a membership there all you need for anything less than the top titles."
5,Building block for a musical genius,"I became a member of Amazon JUST to write this review. If you are a Joel Plaskett Emergency fan, then this CD is a MUST! In this cd you find a harder, more rocking out side to plaskett. Songs sound more deep and meaningfull. This CD has been in my car for over 2 weeks and I can't put take it out. Songs like 'we are being reduced', 'uneventful', 'the day we hit the coast' and 'from the back of the film' will leave you craving more. Plaskett and co-songwriter Rob Benvie create magic on this album, splitting vocals on songs and Rob's song ""Headin' South"" is nothing Plaskett would ever write but it fits into the album so well. This cd blends generation X rock with the soul of the east coast into one. It is a must in any music lovers cd collection."
3,Number of pages,"Good explanation of Catholic philosophy, extremely well written and researched. HOWEVER, the book has 336 pages, not 720 pages as Amazon states. Also the technical quality of the scan is poor, the fonts are not crisp and clear. Why a 336 page book should be 4.7 megabytes is beyond my understanding."
2,"References, NOT Allusions","While this book has many interesting tidbits of information that may make their way into writing, they are most definitely not allusions. At best they are simply literary REFERENCES and therefore this book provides little beyond what you would find in a typical encyclopedia entry about the keyword. Who was Ahab, Frodo, Medusa, etc. Where is hell, olympus, or Narnia. What was manna and so on. Unfortunately, the examples follow the same pattern. Whereas an allusion is indirect and subtle, the examples in this book are direct and explicit references to the keywords (ie ""He was crazy like Ahab,"" instead of something like a subtle quotation from Moby Dick suggesting the character of Ahab). I got this book mainly for the examples in order to see the different ways allusions have been used, but all the examples are simply examples of literary references, not allusions."
1,Don't buy this product,"I bought this stylus expecting it to be something like the original Palm stylus. Well, it's not. It's ugly, doesn't fit well into my iPAQ and it's also overpriced.Conclusion: Don't bother getting this. You'll be disappointed with it."
3,PHISH GETS ITS GROOVE ON,"THREE AND-A-HALF STARSThis is an interesting show. Captured smack in the middle of their groove oriented Fall '97 tour, the band creates a two headed monster here. One, raw rhythm and blues; (Fire, Johnny B. Goode,), the other, airy, wah-wahed grooves that will keep you tapping your feet as long as their being laid down. Good stuff, not as consistently wonderful as some of the other volumes, but good. Trey's current solo project triumphs when it comes to groove.By the way the filler is killer! Wonderful, bombastic explorations on Wolfman's Brother."
5,very good,"very convience!! It came with potential and brackets to adjust fan speed. Nice!Cools down processor 10c to 15c. It's lightweight and ease to install without tools.for AMD XP or Semptron, AMD 64 or Intel Pentuim 4"
4,Loved it,"i ""Watched"" this book and Well i gotta say that it was really great. Hiromu Arakawa adds little comments for every picture and it has great artwork. The backgrounds are a little disappointing, but she does really well on the characters in color. And she PAINTS them! THe colors are extrememly bright and vivid.Hiromu Arakawa is getting better at the characters every year. She's advanced a lot. It's for the manga, not the anime, so if you prefer anime over the manga you may want to get an anime artbook..."
4,A must have for the serious collector/researcher or enthusiast,"Awesome book. Covers the basics of jet era flying headgear. However,I would like to have had more information on the versions of the APH-6,PRK-37/P, MS-22001, HGU-68/P, etc. Other related books include: BoneDomes & Speed Jeans; Vintage Flying Helmets; Flying Headgear of theWorld."
2,You might want to check out the Leadsinger microphone instead,"This is a step up from previous Karaoke systems in that in takes DVD's. Most of the older Karaoke systems only took CD+G discs. Those were discs were very limited and only held a few songs. With DVD's you have the potential of getting many more songs per disc.Even with the DVD option, you still need to buy a number of discs to build up a library of songs. Fortunately, you can get DVD's with 20 songs for around $10 to $15.You might want to check out the Leadsinger microphone instead. It is a self-contained unit, comes with 300 songs and costs less than this unit. It is very portable and has some fun features. You can buy more memory modules, with hundreds to thousands of songs (but they are expensive)."
4,Good soundtrack to a Great film,"The shortest and weakest of the 3 soundtracks, but that's not saying much. John Powell is a brilliant song writer, and while he sat back on this one, he still crafted a few great new songs for it. Tracks 1,2, and 4 our my favorites. Tangiers is especially brilliant. This is a dark and satisfying conclusion to one of the best, most tense trilogy soundtracks I have ever heard."
4,"Really fun , sort of wild","First off, EVERY family needs to have ""Put Your Things Away"" queued in the stereo at all times, on the off chance (?!) your children should need help with picking up. It's a lot of fun and (shhh don't tell the kids) motivational, too, but the most sing-alongable song on this CD is ""The Boo Boo Song"". This song epitomizes what Jammin' Jim does best-- making really fun , sort of wild kid's music that Mom won't mind hearing over and over and over and over and over... Where was I? Oh yes, the review... The nine year old daughter would like to put in a good word for ""Rock & Roll Rub-a-Dub-Dub"" and the seven year old son is sticking firmly to ""The Boo Boo Song"" as his personal favorite. The CD cover looks to be aimed at a younger audience than my kids, but the fact that they are rocking to the ""Funky Monkey"" even as I write must mean this CD had broad appeal."
1,THE GINGERDEAD MAN DVD REVIEW:,"What do you expect people? Gary Busey is a killer gingerbread man? In all, Busey is a convicted killer who gets fried on the eletric chair for the death of the main character's dad and boyfriend at their bakery. His mother, however, requested the ashes. Then she dropped them off at the bakery and took off. Knowing that, the audience can go one form there. The acting wasn't that bad as it thought it was going to be though. Overall, I am suprised that there wasn't a larger body count."
3,Oops,I should've opted for the more expensive one. I've used it just two times and it's already wobbly and ready to fall apart. It's very convenient though.
3,Uneven tempo and length keep this book from being better,"This book was ok. Starts off very interesting and exciting, then lulls--even drags through the latter 2/3 with tedious diary entries that become repetitious and fairly meaningless. In the last 30 or so pages the pace picks up again, but by then I felt like I just wanted to finish the book and be done with it. The payoff at the end was not worth the ride. Given that the ending was the most ingtriguing part of the book, more time should have been spent focusing on that."
2,Ta-da!!! Ooops....,"Four voices, three--make that two and a half--principals, scientific silliness, and no denouement. The cover and other reviews tout a surprise ending. It certainly surprised me. I expected a clever resolution, but got no resolution at all.Carter Beats the Devil, a far superior novel, had a real surprise ending, and I expected something of that order of cleverness. Not here. Here we have a magician pulling the scarf off of his hand and--ta da!!--a rabbit, but a dead one. Sheesh....A 400 page anticlimax"
4,Different from the movie,"I read this before seeing the movie of the same name. The book is a little more subtle, although the movie did get rid of an unnecessary framing device."
4,Good deal for the money!,"This BBT is tried and true when it comes to accuracy. It leaves a few things to be desired (such as backlight, and I found that the batter life is fairly short). If you're looking for a great priced BBT, this is the one for you. Here's a tip... after you conceive, the thermometer works well to tast the bath water temp for baby :)."
4,Great Book,I saw this book at a bookfare and knew i could find it cheaper on Amazon. The stories and illustrations are awesome. Great book if you want to laugh
2,"big work, small book.","Very disappointed, expecting a coffee table book about a favorite designer and got an octavo (6"" x 9"") sized book. Big pictures in large books make a difference where details are important. Will check dimensions in future, have gotten three books, now, smaller than expected. Deceptive photos showing books of large proportions, aren't necessarily so. Hurumph!"
4,"the high, high end of everything","In some ways, this book is shabby chic taken to its ultimate extreme, that is, if you can apply ""shabby"" to virtually priceless museum-quality antiques absolutely dripping with patina and shop-keeper's lore. Rose Tarlow's prose will make you howl -- she is so wealthy and privileged, yet so visceral in her love for the very best, it's pure decorator's porn. I adore this book, although I feel her own home is the best example of her talent, wit, and fantastically comprehensive knowledge. Some of her featured clients' homes are merely opulent and, for my taste, rather predictable and stuffy."
1,It's a rip-off. Skip this book entirely!,"Unbelievably complicated by totally useless information that is neither funny, relevant or useful. It could be easily whittled down to 10 pages, and even then it would contain less info than the Tiger OS Owner's Manual. Spend your $$$ on something else!!"
4,Good introduction to OS X,"This book was my introduction to OS X and it served that purpose very well. It was an enjoyable read and offered a good overview of the features available.Most subjects were not covered in much depth but the book allowed me to see the features and functions offered by Tiger. As a result I was able to pick the subjects I was interested in and investigate them further online and in other books.Humor is certainly not universal but I found most of the author's side comments entertaining. Thanks Andy, ya can't please everyone so don't let it hold you back."
3,hard to read,"The author may have a wealth of information to give, but his writing style makes it difficult to find. He somtimes fills half a page with his non-relevant musings and humor, so you find yourself skimming over a page just to find legimate information - and in the process, maybe missing important facts.I paid 57 cents above the $5. shipping costs and I think I got what I paid for."
2,Too much witt and cute gets onthe way,Mr Ihnatko knows Apple computers OX Tiger system very well. For some one who wants to learn and answers to questions about the OX Tiger system this book is long winded and difficult to navigate though the wit and cute comments of the author. This book could be Half the size if it was not for the hummer
5,Great little radio!,"I use this radio for both ham (70cm band) and GMRS. It feels good in my hand and has plenty of power to reach the two local repeaters in my area. When clipped to my belt, it is small enough that I can sit comfortably with it on. I highly recommend this radio for community emergency communications coordinators who need to bridge ham (ARES/RACES) and local neighborhood communications using FRS/GMRS. (By the way, see http://emcomus.org/commwp.html for more information about emergency communications for neighborhoods and communities.)"
5,"Best ever version of ""Come on Eileen.""","I cannot stop listening to this cut. Monique Powell has a great voice and knows how to use it. This is one of the all-time-best tracks I've heard. Find the words to ""Come On Eileen"" at the lyricsxp.com website and try to keep up with Monique. ""No Doubt"" does NOT cover this one."
3,The High Holy Days review,"I received the book in new condition, shipping did not beat it up.However I was disappointed in the level of reading of the book from my perspective, buying books for research on Jewish culture & religion.The content was correct however I missed the age level (or it wasn't posted) that this book is a children's book of Elementary grade level, though the content presented was good.I would certainly recommend this book for Elementary school level kids wanting to learn abit about Jewish culture & life for Passover.Jim Brown"
4,IBO: A Story of Biafra,"I found the book ""IBO: A Story of Biafra"" to be very excitingand thought-provoking. The cover is very powerful."
2,lost the touch years ago,"the souls were always the punk band that i could still buy new albums from even when i was more into other types of music. since ""...summer vacation"" and now ""anchors aweigh"" that has changed. i think losing their drummer after ""hopeless romantic"" really changed the sound. he was very percussive and sometimes sloppy but had a style. and now instead of being able to identify that i'm listening to the bouncing souls within seconds, i put this in and it might as well be any generic punk band. whereas early albums had songs that all sounding different, it's all the same here. and the lyrics are about nothing except for ""what's in our hearts"" and loytatly and nostalgia. it's boring. pick up the first four and don't bother with this. i give it two stars because they at least still put on a killer live show ."
3,You make me sing.,"Here we have another Ventures ""twofer"" from the UK.Rock and Roll Forever stems from September 1972. It is a roots album. All the tunes are classic rock and roll instrumentals from the 1950s and early 1960s, including a remake of The Ventures own hit ""Ram-Bunk-Shush"". These are really good versions of classic rock instrumentals.Rocky Road is from March of 1976. It is billed as being by ""The New Ventures"". The ""New"" Ventures don't sound like The ""Old"" Ventures at all. This is a disco album, complete with a female chorus singing the title of the song. Some of the melodys are good, but the songs go on too long.1. Honky Tonk (Pats 1 & 2)2. Last Night3. Smokie4. Rumble5. You Can't Sit Down6. Ram-Bunk-Shush7. 20-758. Guitar Boogie Shuffle9. Raunchy10. Soul Twist11. Sleep Walk12. Moonlight Serenade13. Daylight14. Temptation, Temptation15. Superstar Revue16. The Stroke17. Stepout18. Gotta Be Stronger"
1,worst vacuum ever,"This vacuum has been an ongoing disaster and I now am replacing it after 3 years. The belt broke after 1 year and again after 2 years and it required a repair person to replace it, as it is impossible to get to it. Not covered under warranty, of course. Also got a clog in the tube, again requiring a visit to the repair person. Now on/off button has a short and constantly have to play with it to keep it running. No more Hoovers for me."
2,Mixed results,"Pros:- Does great on carpets and fairly well on bare floors- I've used a Dyson and they pick up equivalent about of dirt/pet hair- lays flat so that you can get under beds and tables- great extension hose- Decent selection of accessories- easy to cleanCons:- Originally purchased machine had to be returned due to a faulty power switch- second machine lasted 2 years until a frayed wire in the cord leading to the bristle motor made carpet vacuum useless.- ""powered"" hand tool is powered by the suction and clogs easily.- plastic on the tilt pedal broke and needed to be glued- need to replace filter about once a year- light (although rather pointless) burned out in the first weekFor a little extra money I would recommend a Dyson since it has a 5 year warranty and no need for replacement filters."
2,Not what was expected,The final trigger mechanism was not what I expected. It is a lever that has to be held down and I expected more of a trigger that would stay on. It gets old holding the lever on.
1,It lasted 3 months...,And now a charge will last a day or so. Before charges would last several days. FYI.
1,Hippie music,"This was very disappointing, and I'm pretty mad I spent $15 on it. The music and the vocals are hokey. I found no SPIRIT of the Sea in any of the songs. Sea Shanties should be sung by men who have braved the seas, not by a girl singing a boy's song. If you like soul-less hippie music, this CD is for you..if you want real sea shanties, you DEFINITELY need to look elsewhere."
4,Very good game for Potter fans,I thought this game was very well made. It appears it was made after the Chamber of Secrets. The game layout and style of play were exactly the same. The storyline follows the first book very well with some added adventures.
4,sorcerer's stone,I think the game was rather good the graphics were kind of messy and the loading was annoying but overall the game was wonderful. Oh and what is up with the game player review if that person hates harry potter than why did they buy it? so peoples only buy the game if your a fan.
1,EA You Let Me Down Again,"Ww all played this game on the PS1 and it was the worst game EVER! But we got this on the PS2?!WHY? Here's why I hate this game.Story:it's the same as the book and movie.GamePlay:same as COS.Graphics:it's messey and chessey.SoundWork:good and bad,because the voice work is really bad and muisc is bad.Overall:Harry Potter A.T.S.S is the worst game on the PS2 EVER!Did I meton that it's to easy!I give it a 1 out of 5!I give it a 1 out of 5."
1,I hate Harry Potter,i hated it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid da i am harry potter don't let vole-de-mort kill me i have a scar so i am special everyone look at my scar
4,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review,"This is an awsome game. The graphics are almost the same as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for PS2 (they look nothing like on the cover). This is a little bit challenging for the first game released, but with a little bit of strategy and logic...all the tasks come together. I loved how well it followed the movie. I gave this game 5 stars because it is VERY addictive and EXTREMELY fun. Hope this review helped."
5,"So comfy, a cheap way to transfrom your bed to a cloud-like haven.",I love this so much that I ordered it in a twin for traveling. Though I have yet to attempt to take it on a plane.
5,Review before every interview,Absolutely the best interview book available on the market! Questions are a little dated but they still offer great advice on how to answer the questions correctly and win the interview.
1,Not for Computer People.,"Within 5 minutes of looking at the book, I can definately say that the information is NON-TECHNICAL. It outlines stories of lawsuits regarding products, what to do when you are a manager, how to fill out a QA sheet. Not good if you are interested in programming.BTW: publish date is 1988, not found on the amazon profile."
5,A Masterpiece,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. When I first heard it, I was extremely surprised because I have a low tolerance for unclean vocals. However, there is a perfect mix of screaming and clean singing and you can feel the emotion that is put into the vocals as well as the music. I absolutely love the entire album from start to finish and highly recommend it."
4,Very Decent,"Although, as many others are quick to point out, there are better bands out there in the world. But not every band out there can be, and if you only listen to the best band in the world, your CD collection will be mighty thin. It is obvious that these guys aren't here to replace Metalica and such metal bands or punk bands of equal caliber. They are here to make music that is enjoyable to listen to and if your willing to listen to that then get this CD. Some people will disagree with me and say that they're not worth listening to, but if everyone agreed about what music to listen to then music would get real boring real quick. Since you won't know whether you like these guys till you listen to them, go to there site and listen to the sample tracks and this will give you a feel of what they're like. Don't listen what everyone tries to tell or what i'm telling just listen and deside for yourself."
5,I fell and this woke me up,"I love when an album that I've been anticipating lives up to my hype. A7X kept intense screaming vocals we heard on Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, but added a lot more melodic singing. M. Shadows' vocals have really improved on this album. With a lot of metal or hardcore, the songs start to get repetitive, but on Waking the Fallen, every song keeps you interested. Like on StST there are some slower songs (good thing), but not really straight up punk songs (bad thing). I'm sure its the new producer, Mudrock (godsmack, yuck). Overall, this cd is great, a refreshing listen in the metal/hardcore world."
5,One of the best albums I have listened to,"Just a few days ago, I wasn't even aware of Avenged Sevenfold. I had once listened to their track 'Unholy confessions' but that was quite some time ago but I didn't think they would such a great band after I listened to all of the songs in their album 'Walking the fallen'. It's so good! The more I listen to it, the more I love it! They never get old.They sound a lot like Killswitch Engage (one of my most fave band) but the vocals are so much better!With AWESOME guitar riffs, some really great piano, violin parts, and fantastic melodic, rhythmic and energetic new-age metallica type vocals, this abum will OWN you!Seriously, please don't pay attention to the silly people writing biased reviewes and bashing this band with totally unnecessary criticism.Avenged Sevenfold rocks! Whether or not you like Metal/Rock, you'll love their music. So buy it today!"
2,not great stuff...,"for starters, avenged sevenfold has been a pretty good band in the past-their last cd was pretty good, so i bought this one. the music is different from their energetic old stuf, this is more bland, if you know what i mean. i heard 'second heartbeat' on hopelessly devoted to you and thought this band still had some good music coming, but in their cd, they totally redid second heartbeat! now its slower, the guitars are less daring, and the the singing is way more boring. thats kind of a reflection of their first cd and this one!as for their image--hilarious! i dont know if they try to make their cd appearance look corny, but everything from the gay dancing skeletons to the ""spooky"" spider webs and cackling witch, is screaming three-year old halloween party."
2,Whiny Emo Crap,"The music on this cd is OK, ripping off Maiden, In Flames and other melodic metal - But the vocals and the production and image (not to mention lyrics) are pure teenage poser emo crap. This band has ""fake"" & ""cute"" metal nicknames and they wear the latest trendy Hot Topic clothing. Sure the playing is competant - but it's an infiltration of Heavy Metal by some kids who probably made fun of metal music a few years ago. Hey - skulls are cool, lets make a scary band."
1,Poseur metalcore garbage,"This band sucks. This has got to be one of the most overrated bands ever. They add sreaming into a pop-rock song and call it metal. That is if it can be called screaming. The singer's whiny emo voice alone should be enough to convince you that this band isn't metalcore. Want real metalcore? Listen to Hatebreed, God Forbid, old Killswitch Engage, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Chimaira, Bury Your Dead, Between The Buried And Me, Terror, Merauder, etc. Want real metal in general? Listen to Cannibal Corpse, At The Gates, Mnemic, Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad, Behemoth, etc. Just leave this CD on the shelves."
2,Trash,"I love their new cd. So when I found out that people love their older cds and don't really like their new cd, I decided to check this one out. Now I know why no one listens to metal heads. This album is crap. There are a couple good songs, and they are all, not surprisingly, the ones where shadows actually sings for the most part. You stupid metal heads say that city of evil is too poppy. Well the reason none of your music is popular is because it all sounds the same and it all sucks. Just like most of the songs on this cd. Can't tell the difference. And since city of evil is the better cd but is behind in the rating, it shows that amazon.com ratings mean absolutely nothing. I recommend this cd to people who enjoy terrible vocals and instrumentals that don't live up to potential at all. True talent is displayed on city of evil."
3,emo thing,"i had the biggest crush possible on second heartbeat(old version).so i bought waking the fallen thinking the entire album would be as complete as the song.i was wrong!way mellower sound,plenty ofdesperate cries and too much girly songs.for old fans this must be the greatest album ever made but avenged sevenfold is definetly not a metal band!"
5,Why no democracy?,"This is a very well put together book, and after reading it all the way through I realised it's the first time I have been able to fully understand why democracy has not taken root and, in the western sense at least, is unlikely to take root in the near future. The book is also very useful for showing how the rulers have desperately tried to diversify their economic base, and although most of the statistics only go up to 2004, this is easily the best book I have seen of the development of a Gulf state."
2,Drags,"Note that this tome is 500 pages. It's consequently filled with shopping trips, sending out Christmas gifts to family, parties, etc., adding nothing to the plot development. The first-person narrator talks a lot about her lover but we don't even meet him until page 210 or so, and then their banter and gift exchange takes up a few more chapters. The book could easily have been half as long.Most authors can give us rich character development without dragging us along on a character's inconsequential day-to-day activities. In fact, after learning so much about ""Blondie,"" the main character, and ""Mike,"" the cop, even to the point of including their penchant for watching Jeopardy! every day, I couldn't care less about these very self-absorbed people.And as for plot development, so little progress is made on the case for so long that I wasn't much interested in the plot either."
2,"more heart, less description","hmmmm have just finished it - started out promisingly, got a bit slow in the middle then went on to finish somewhat implausibly! having read all of fairstein's alex cooper series, i think there is something missing - perhaps it's heart. a strong female lead is great but alex just doesn't have enough frailties (that we're privvy to) to make her human and appealing. the strong woman character is (thank goodness) nothing new in this genre but she seems more of an imitation of tempe or kay.anyway, not a bad holiday read, but once i skimmed the descriptive passages of the island and its history there wasn't too much left to the actual plot."
5,New York history + mystery,"I love a good mystery...and when it is immersed with bits of history of New York City, I love it even more. Alex Cooper is now involved in the murder of a King's College professor, Lola Dakota (you gotta love that name!). A bit of paper with numbers on Lola's dead body sends Alex and Mike Chapman on a quest to Roosevelt Island, off the shore of Manhattan. We learn about the history of the island, including hospitals for the insane and small pox victims. Lola's colleagues become suspect for various reasons. Just another ""can't put it down"" book."
2,"Great concept, but a let down.","This was my first Linda Fairstein book, but I am not compelled to pick up another. It was almost as though she was writing a book to write a book, not because she had something to say.The concept itself was very interesting and a lot could have happened with it, but in the end I found the book rather boring and uninteresting. I finished it because I wanted to know ""who dun it"" but I could have left it unfinished and it wouldn't have bothered me a bit.The plot was kind of flaky, the subplots could have been left out entirely, and there was just far too much politics and backbiting. Perhaps things really are that was for a female in the legal environment, but books are where we go to *escape* reality.Finally, the ending even seemed rushed, as though there was a page allotment and too much had been used up already.Bottom line, I would not recommend this particular book."
5,Raising Blaze Raises the Bar,"Debra Ginsberg has accomplished the near-impossible: she's written a book about one of the most difficult human experiences there is--raising a child who is troubled and troubling--and managed to make the reading experience not only uplifting but enlightening. Raising Blaze is disturbing, beautiful, poignant, and moving. It's also a call to action. We don't need to accept mistreatment of our children by a system that devalues them, as Ginsberg shows us so poetically. The best book I've read on the topic, and the best memoir to come along in a long time."
3,Porches & Sunrooms for Dummies,"I'm in the process of designing a three season porch for our house. I expected this book to provide Ideas and it mainly discusses best practices for proper structure etc. The book also claims over 400 pictures and I didn't count, but it's not even close and that's what I wanted more than what type of footings for each type room."
2,"Neat, small and decent functionality, questionable quality","Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts."
3,Good but not water resistant,Overall I loved my TrailDrop compass until I took it swimming (only a few feet below the surface) and two days later it died.Positives:- Great form factor: size and shape are perfect... I would consider this to be the primary reason to consider purchase- Decent accuracy on compass... not for serious hiking but good enough to point the general directionNegatives:- Thermometer seems to be way off... also needs time to cool down after being in a pocket- Not Water Resistant- Color beings to wear away after several long hard trips- Confusing interface (at first)
1,"Bad purchase, not for long interest or young children","The book's content is disappointing & not appropriate for younger children: ""You're not my friend if you don't come to my party!"" and brief mention of spin the bottle. Not even a good story, in my opinion.The structure of the book is also disappointing. The vinyl stickers are only for use on the front and back fold out covers, which as another reviewer stated are already way too busy for adding stickers. The story is only 5 pages long, the other 12 pages are single use activity sheets that would entertain a 2nd-3rd grader for no more than a single sitting/day at most.While I was excited to find reusable stickers, this is not a good buy at all, especially for the price.I don't recommend it, especially not for preschoolers, kindergartners or even 1st graders, nor for any possible long term use."
5,Excellent and original mystery,"This one is first rate. It ties a plot about illegal immigrants in Britain to the personal and family story of the young lawyer-heroine. The author herself is a member of the House of Lords, and the tale includes two women peers whose wisdom and humor is an additional but non-distracting part of the tale."
2,CHROME CHIPPED OFF WHEN PUT TOGETHER,"WHEN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THE ""CHROME"" PEALED RIGHT OFF..THE LEGS ARE METAL BUT THE CHROME COLOR IS OVER IT AND WHEN YOU PUT THE SCREWS IN THE CHEAP CHROME COMES RIGHT OFF,,,IM SO MAD"
3,Good value....,"I bought this cart to use to transfer laundry from my washer to the dryer, as the dryer is located across the room from the washer.....it works fine. The only improvement I would find is to make the bag not so deep. I am not a tall person, and it difficult for me to reach the bottom of the bag."
2,"Who was this film about, anyway?","Okay, I still haven't been able to see ""Boys Don't Cry,"" but I think it will be much better than this documentary. Fascinated by the story, I decided to go to a showing of this film at the university I attend. I wanted to learn more about the girl behind the story. I was disappointed to find that the movie focused more on the people who knew Teena than on Teena herself. And the people who knew her...other audience members actually laughed at their stupidity. The documentary was amusing, even though its subject was not. Overall, I was unsatisfied because I left feeling that I had learned very little about Teena Brandon and what she went through. See it if you're interested, but don't expect to get too much out of it."
4,Great learning tool,"My husband asked me to find a book of some kind for Adobe Illustrator because he knew WHAT he wanted to do, but couldn't figure out HOW. I did the research on my favorite site (Amazon!) and picked this one. He loves it!! He's been going through chapter by chapter and learning all kinds of new stuff. Thank you Amazon.com, and thanks to all the posters for the reviews."
4,A quick guide to Illustrator,"In a few words what are the capabilities to the package, with a nice companion of labs and examples."
5,Good book to learn Illustrator CS2,I started learning Illustrator CS2 after buying CS2 Standard Edition. I have gone through this book twice so that I can fully understand what this book offers. I am not sure where I would have begun with Illustrator without this book. The book/lessons are well organized and associated workshop files in the CD compliment the whole process of learning this complex vector-based graphic program. I recommend this book to anyone who has just started learning this program or who is interested in brushing up various aspects of Illustrators.I am now moving on to Illustrator Wow book and Illustrator CS2 @ Work book to learn Illustrator from different angles.
2,Errors in a book by Adobe?,"Maybe mistakes are inevitable, but in a book published under Adobe's name? I was lookng through a copy at a bookstore to see if I wanted to buy it, and happened to flip to the section on Illustrator and Photoshop and found several mistakes - not spelling mistakes mind you, but technical errors. For example, it says you cannot export type on a path or area type from Ill to PS but as of CS you can.Makes me wonder how many other things were not updated to the latest version? Also makes me hestitate to buy it."
1,pretty lame,"Here's the problem; each DVD has about 45 minutes worth of show on it. Everything on this 3 DVD set could have easily fit on 1 DVD. They were placed on 3 DVD's to make it seem as though you were getting a semi-reasonable deal for $25 or so. However, you are in reality buying less than one full DVD's worth of material.Beyond that, this was poorly organized, poorly put together; and the options were pretty much nil. Only one DVD had ""extras"" and I have no idea how the extras differed from the rest of the DVD.Unless you are really hard up, pass this by."
2,Fun to watch if you have nothing better to do,"If you are a fan of the show, then this might be fun for you to watch. Especially if you missed some episodes like I did. You get to hear all the foul language, and for the women that felt the need to show their silicone enhanced boobs, you get to see some nipple that would make CBS cringe. LOL It's fun to watch if you have nothing better to do."
1,Huh?,"This book is absolutely impossible. If you've been tricked into buying it, good luck. I couldn't understand a thing."
5,Excellent lessons useful in other dev environments as well,"This really is an excellent book. The examples that Matthew uses to teach in each chapter are useful far beyond just wired QuickTime. I keep it next to my desk for use in my other development environments as well.For example there is a chapter on scripted motion which talks about linear interpolation, easing in and out, motion along mathematical functions, circular motion, paths and spline interpolation. I incorporated a few of these animation algorithms into my desktop applications and they work/look great.Highly recommended."
1,Resale old old old videos,"This video was obviously made in the 60's or 70's, the content was weak and did not really teach the art of massage, and is a video I would not recommend to anyone. There must be something newer out there that is not constrained by the attitudes that were around decades ago. I would not recommend this video to anyone... a waste of money."
4,Cheap material,"The first time I purchased this product for my dog was in 2005. I have a female Rottweiler and figured that the product would only last a couple of day's. To my surprise it lasted nearly a year before she was able to bite her way into to mechanism inside. I purchased two more of these with the same result, and then the store quit carrying this item. Recently I found the toy online and purchased two of them. Both have proven to be not nearly as well made as they were a few years ago. In less than an hour she destroyed both balls. The reason is because the ball used to have a thicker rubber coating and no seam which appeared to make the ball able withstand the powerful jaws of a Rottweiler. Now it appears that the company is skimping on quality while increasing the price and decreasing it's durability. This product is definitely NOT for large breeds regardless of what the manufacturer states, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This product could prove to be dangerous to your dog."
1,Ball worked for a couple minutes....,I've bought lots of these balls at Petco and they worked fine for years but not this one!! It lit up a few times and maybe made one sound but within a few minutes the ball was completely dead! I'd love to get this toy for my new dog but I'm afraid to order another one on Amazon for fear it won't work.
1,Destroyed in Seconds,"I have a boxer who enjoys chasing balls that make noise. Within seconds he had punctured the thin, soft, bendable plastic coating which was breaking off into small choaking hazards. Very disappointed in the quality of this product."
4,"The ONLY ball ""Banjo"" will play with","""Banjo"" has chewed up countless numbers of these.With ANY noise making ball he KNOWS there's something INSIDEthat he MUST get OUT.He will not chase ANY OTHER ball (must be the scent of the plastic).Yes they do lose their shape after a short time. No matter.It doesn't bounce very well, and sometimes it won't turn OFF,even though I've tried ""drowning"" it in water !Eventually, he will chew through the ball to get to thehard/plastic ""nerve center""..... GAME OVER.One ball can last a couple months as he's only givenaccess to it when we play, ""fetch"". Otherwise he'd chewthrough it in about 20 minutes.I hope they NEVER stop making these!Rj"
2,bummed,"Great idea, and would have been a great buy if it didn't break. If your dog is a heavy chewer, then I would definitely not reccomend this item. It broke the very first night the dog played with it. If your dog is not a chewer, and you are just looking for a ball to play fetch with, then I would guess this will work. Just don't know because the boxer that I bought this for cracked it in half after a couple of chews."
4,Not necessarily for the novice...,"I also had to purchase this book for culinary school. While this book can be difficult to understand, the quality of the instructor has a great deal to do with the user's comprehension of the subject matter. I find this an excellent book and continue to use it today (because I know how to make it work for me).NOTE: The formulas in this book work, provided you have had proper instruction in how to use them, and in how to use Baker's Math to increase and reduce the yields."
4,For the future professional baker,"This is another of the books I use as reference for my cooking school. It contains recipes from Le Cordon Bleu schools and recipes from America. Most of the recipes are for large quantities and it is definately not a book for the home baker, this is a great reference book to be used in a professional pastry kitchen.I particularly like this book because it gives you a basic recipe for let's say a bavarois cream, and then it gives you ten other variations (chocolate, coffee, strawberry, etc) that you can make by changing or adding one or two ingredients.The instructions are clear and easy to follow.I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is thinking of baking seriously."
1,Complete Waste!,"this book is an atrocity to the pastry chef, i don't know about you but i want to see what i'm cooking and this book has very few pictures, and the recipes are completely wrong i've used this book in culinary school, 70% of the things we cooked were absolutely flavorless, and just plain didn't work! and the only reason i still have it is to occupy space in my library, i highly recommend Advanced Bread and Pastry by Michel Suas, or Baking and Pastry by the CIA, and for professionals Bo Fribergs books The Professional Pastry Chef, and Advanced Professional Pastry Chef"
2,Seems like a filler if anything,"After reading the first book in the homecoming saga I was fairly dissapointed in The Call To Earth. The 2nd book seemed to lack any real substance. There really is nothing going on, it seems to me that Card made this book as a filler. There are a bunch of useless characters and useless events, this book could easily be condensed to around 200 pages and be much better than it is now. Personally I did enjoy it, although I have to admit more then a few times I dosed off reading the book and skipped a few pages simply to try to stop the boredom. I am hoping this book is a build up to the 3rd book in the series, if not Im afraid the rest of the saga may be just as bad if nto worse."
2,Oversoul? Try over-sold!,"I'm quite a fan of Orson Scott Card, and I appreciate that he lets his faith infuse his writing. Although not a Morman, Irecognize Card's inherent morality as one of his strong points. Unfortunately, in this book, and in this series, Card has gotten away from forming his writing by moral dilemmas, and instead has gotten into subtle propaganda for the LDS church. It's kind of like L. Ron Hubbard writing about Xebu or clams.The combination makes this work both below Card's normally excellent standards, and also not a very good book."
3,Poor editing in Kindle version,"The storyline is relatively decent. Not as great as the Xenocide/Ender universe, but pretty good.Other than claiming human civilization is only 10k yrs old, most of the universe in this series is fairly consistent with itself and with possibility.The characters are fairly well developed, and overall it flows fairly easily.The problem I have is that there are OCR errors all through these books which is an unacceptable editing quality for any format of book. Also, the maps and similar front matter are not high enough resolution to pick out all of the details from the original graphics.These limitations come across as disrespectful to the author and to the audience."
1,Mindless,"Juvenile. I was stuck with a couple of books from the Homecoming series on a 6 hour flight. The characters are annoyingly one-dimensional - the good are too good and the evil too evil. It appears that Card is just telling a very simplistic morality tale, stretched over many books. Might be enlightening to a 6 year (an extraordinary naive one). Stick to Aesop's Fables for this kind of stuff. I threw the books out."
4,Well satisfied,"Good as always. Card delivers. I choose his books based on the fact that he wrote them, and I've never been dissappointed."
2,Poorly design headphone,"I purchased this headphone 2 months ago and boy was I disappointed. Unless you have big ears to hook the headphones on, you are out of luck! The ear piece keeps falling off and you can not adjust the ear piece to make it fit. I absolutely wasted my money and if I were you, I try to find something else. The quality of the sound may be a good one but I haven't had a chance to make a fair judgement only because the darn thing keeps falling off from my ear!"
2,hard to keep on ears,I bought these earphones hoping they would stay on my ears when I was working out/running. Unfortunately they keep sliding off and I have to constantly keep pushing them back on my ears when I'm running. but maybe that's just my ears...
2,Not compatible for people who wear eyeglasses,"The product is reliable, comfortable and has good sound quality when they stay on on your ears and are not falling off. I have average sized ears and these just done stay on/in my ears when I run. Therefore, I am constantly fiddling with them and re-adjusting them or putting them back on when I run. I also think they are horrible for people who wear eyeglasses as they need to go under the arms to stay on, which stretches your arms...I don't like anything that frustrates me when I am trying to run. I hardly use them and just use my I phone headphones. I had to use them today and was reminded why I hate them."
2,Sony headphones MDR-J10,"I actually purchased the blue ones. These hurt my ears, there is not any flexibility in the ear pieces. I know this is because I wear glasses, so if you also wear glasses buy headphones that are soft and flexible. I have tried the glasses over and under the headphones, still not comfortable, actually made the top of my ears ache."
2,Stopped working after 9 months.,"I received the earphones for Christmas last year. They worked well for about 9 months, and then suddenly they stopped working. I use them at my Health Club, and they stopped working on all the machines. When I called Sony, they could not help me without a Sales Receipt."
2,"sound is good, fit is not","this was the first pair of these types of headphones i'd ever bought, so i cheaped out. the sound is decent but if you're going to use them doing any type of physical activity, forget it, they'll be slipping out of your ears, especially running/jogging or any type of exorcising that causes sweat. they will become slippery and impossible to keep in. you'll spend more time fidgeting with them than anything else."
4,Good buy,"Not the best quality sound, but perfect for running - doesn't cancel out all sounds so hazards like dogs and cars can still be heard. They won't fall of - even if you're sweating like crazy!"
1,Broken in six months,"I bought this on seeing ""4 Star"" rating in Amazon.com. It was pretty good when I bought. Now I could not hear any sound from my right side headphone. Very disappointed on the quality from Sony. Be aware when buying this."
3,Ok as backup,"This headset is ok, but as a backup pair only: the earpieces don't go very deep in the ear so the bass is very weak.There is also no clip to tie the dangling cord to clothing with, so it flaps around during exercise.Finally, the orange color is really closer to pink."
4,Headphones,"I can't stand earbuds and I needed headphones to use while jogging. I researched some and found these. It's not the best sound, but they are comfortable and stay on pretty well while running. It seems to have stretched out a little bit, but continue to stay on. The only complaint I have is the sound doesn't shoot directly into your ear like earbuds. When running the headphones shift some and it shoots out some."
4,Sony MDR-J10 sport headphones,"Once I got used to fitting the earpieces over my ears and seating the speakers in my ears it works great and sounds very good. They stay in place while I work in the yard or on cars. For the price I paid (less than $10, including shipping) a great bargain!"
5,sony is always a win,"i like sony stuff. in got this item quickly, one week before i was expecting it. good sound i like them alot"
4,Nobody agrees on the fit!,"I've tried all types of lightweight headphones and I have a very difficult time with finding a pair that will stay put without causing pain. For me, these work better than any other headphone design. Period.***** The reviews I've read that say they don't fit are exactly the opposite of what I experienced, so if you need a solution to a 'fitting' problem please try these for yourself. *****Sound is above average but not 5-star rating, but since they fit I would not own any others!"
5,LOVE,I love how the sounds come out of them. If you have glasses you have to put these on first which can be bothersome if people wanting to talk to you all the time.
2,Misleading Title,"An interesting read, with lots of information about the huge oil, aluminum, banking, etc., companies. The title is very misleading, as I couldn't find any instances where Paul Mellon actually did anything wrong, personally. You'd think, based on the title, that Mr. Mellon was an evil puppetmaster, pulling strings and controlling the energy supply of the planet. In actuality, he and his family simply own huge portions of stock in many different companies, much like most fabulously wealthy families do. I don't blame Paul, or any of the Mellons, for anything they do or have done in the past, any more that I'd blame Bill Gates or Warren Buffett for enjoying their immense wealth. It's simply not anyone's business what someone does with their own money, but since this book was written in 1974, and there was certainly a hippie bias against ""the establishment"" in that era, I can't blame the author."
4,A VERY GOOD LOOK THE PACKER GREAT,"THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING, WELL WRITTEN, AND DONE WITH HONESTY. RAY'S TEAM ATTITUDE AND WORK ETHICS ARE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. HE WAS A BUTT KICKER AND A FORCE IN THE NFL. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS. TO GET A REAL GOOD LOOK AT HOW FOOTBALL SHOULD BE PLAYED READ THIS. ONE HELLUVA GOOD READ.VERY RECOMMENDED."
5,gorgeous music - takes you to another dimension,"I (like the other reviewer - funny enough) had this tape from years ago and saved it despite how beat up it is now. I came online to see if I could find a CD copy of it and here it is. I am definitely buying it - it is an amazingly beautiful adventure. I meditate to it but it's been hard, as the tape is so old that it keeps starting and stopping as it gets stuck at certain places - so I""ll be glad to get the CD so I can enjoy it again. If you have a spiritual practice or are a massage therapist, etc. you will love this CD - it is like nothing you have ever heard."
3,Its fine,Its ok. I haven't noticed anything major about it. I will say that I keep it in my bedroom closet. We had mold in there once before ...and I haven't seen any since putting this in there.
2,no noticible improvement,"I've had this in a closet for about a week. It is very humid where we live. So far it has not made any noticeable difference and I've had to recharge twice this week alone.It is beasically the same as those crystals you get at the drug store for a couple of dollars, but it plugs in (awkwardly) instead of being put in an oven to dry.It may work well where it is not very humid, but then, what's the point?I also bought 2 other everdry units at the same time. The next one up is effectively the same as this but larger. The ""petit"" unit work like the larger ones, collecting water in a resevoir. It has made more difference in a few hours then this one did in a week.I'm considering another one of those, but would not buy this one again.Very disappointing."
1,Needs charging every 2-3 days,"Very disappointing. There is no way this unit holds 8 oz. a day. I have used other dehumidifier products that lasted 2 weeks, absorbing up to 16 oz. I bought 4 based on positive reviews... It was a mistake."
2,Ok product,Dont understand how product works. After containing humidity it inputs it back into the air which is silly.
2,Just didn't do the job,"We bought this product after reading favorable reviews on this site, and on some others. A number of the reviews noted that it was effective in small bathrooms, so we tried it for ours (about 5' X 8') and were sorely disappointed. One problem was likely that our expectations were too high for such a small device to be effective in the bathroom. It does seem like it was absorbing moisture, because the silica beads changed color. However, the biggest problem we had was that the recharging just didn't work. We left it plugged in (in a well ventilated room) for hours, but the silica beads never returned to their blue color. After trying to charge it three times, the best we got was a pinkish purple color. The unit also got alarmingly hot when it was plugged in for recharging. Further, some of the silica beads seemed to deform/melt from the charging - Perhaps because the unit got too hot? Either way, we returned the product."
3,"Big, heavy, and relatively fragile, but it does work","I bought this to put inside a medium sized safe and it does seem to be doing a good job of controlling moisture, it's been in there 7-10 days and still doing okay, no need to recharge yet.That being said, my main complaint is that this thing is big, like 4x7x1.5"" or so, and most of that space is for the electric heater that ""recharges"" it by heating the gel balls inside. So it takes up a lot of space, relative to the inside of my modest safe.Also, this thing is heavy, and if you drop it from even just a couple feet, it can cause damage both to your floor and the device. It slipped out of my hands once and the impact separated the housing some and gel balls started leaking out. I was able to snap it back together, but this is pretty cheap design that could have been fixed with some screws instead of plastic snaps.Note this gets quite warm when ""charging"" so keep it out of reach of children to be safe."
3,"Just got it, to soon to tell.","Ordered two for gun cabinet, plugged in for maximum moisture control, placed in gun cabinet with humidity meter. So we'll see. Seems to be a quality product. Transaction, shipping were all good."
2,eva small dehumidifier,"The product arrived within a reasonable time period so I have no problem with the purchase from the supplier. However, I should inform those who want to dehumidify a space larger than a cabinet that it needs recharging regularly. I have placed them in closets, a glass-fronted bookcase, and out in the open and they take only a few days to require reccharging via evaporation using an outlet. I would have ordered a larger unit if I had known this. They do work but are for small spaces. I live in a fairly arid environment as well so those who live in a more humid locale - say the east coast should upgrade to a larger model from the same manufacturer. Otherwise, the service was good."
4,Great low-maintenance dehumidifier,"I have had this in a gun safe for the last few months and just recently had to recharge it. The winter was warm and the spring has been warm as well but I have yet to run my air-conditioner. My home hasn't been too damp but I haven't noticed any rust on my rifles or pistols. Neither has there been a funky smell from the safe. Recently, the little pellets in the center display indicated they were getting wet. I plugged this device into the wall and it was dry within an hour. I keep my guns lubed normally but I find this to be effective in reducing the humidity in the safe. I don't have any dramatic ""wet-to-dry"" stories, so I feel the highest rating I can give is 4/5 stars."
3,Ok while it lasted,I bought it to substitute the disposable moisture absorbing packages and it seemed to work well for a while. After some time it started filling up with moisture very quickly and eventually it stopped working. It lasted ok for about a year. Now I'm back to the disposable packages because I like actually seeing the humidity accumulate and not having to use electricity and open a window in the cold weather to make sure the humidity exits my house and doesn't stay inside.
2,Eva-dry Renewable 300/333 dehumidifier,"I didn't care for this Eva dry product. When I plug it in half the crystals turn blue the other half are still pink. But it states not to leave it plugged in past 12 hours. So if all the crystals don't turn blue, what do you do? Maybe this one is simply a lemon. It does seem to absorb some moisture, but considering the size of the closet (2'W,3'L,6'H) it should be able to absorb any moisture in this small area. I bought a larger Eva dry that works better."
3,Pretty much the same as the first game for PS2,"First of all I want to say that in the game you can only ""Bust Out"" in the Get A Life mode so far that I have noticed. Another thing that I noticed is that when you can ""Bust Out"" you can only go to people`s houses not go downtown and shop like in the computer versions.There is only one other negative thing that i have to say about the sims,you only have three lots in your neighborhood unlike the other one where you can have many.Now for the positive side of the game. I liked how many different hair styles and clothing selections you had to choose from. I also thought that the products and graphics were really great,much better than the first one. Overall i think that the game is great just to close to the first one."
1,Boring,The Sims Bustin Out is a really really boring game. It is the same thing as every other sims game but you are in different places. All you do is control someones life. Dont buy it. It is a waste of monney.
3,"OK, but the graphics are bad","I bought this game thinking that it was going to be as fun as the last Sims game for PS2. When i got home and played it, i started out on the new and ""improved"" get a life mode. The new features and options are fun and all, but the graphics stink. Yeah, so maybe you can zoom in more, but the colors are just depressing. It makes the game no fun to play. Also, the get a life missions are just the same as the last game. You start out living with your mom, and then you move in with dudley, and then you go on to live with someone else. I found it really boring and havn't found the want to play it since i first bought it. My advice to you is to only buy this games if you are a big The Sims fan and you love the games. Otherwise, just save your money, or buy a different game."
4,Wonderful Cd,Very enjoyable easy listening Cd by a talented musicianWould highly recommended this Cd to anyone that likes easy listening music
3,Review,"This is a nice album but not as good as the group's first album, Meet Danny Wilson. I would rate it as 75%."
2,Nice Try. Secret Weapons was WAY better,"I'm starting to agree with other writers of reviews for this game. That damn instructor that keeps yelling at you any time you demonstrate any free will should be shot. This game is a SAD copy of Secrety Wepons Over Normandy. I'm a huge WWII aircraft buff and spend my free time studying the aircraft of that era. Of course it was fun to fly the F4U for a sec but the missions are ridiculous. The graphics are good and there's a great use of WW II propaganda posters between missions. I did like that you can get a view as if your actually in the cockpit as well. However that view is that same no matter what plane your in. At least with ""Secret Weapons"" they did their homework. I'm sorry but there's no way any fighter pilot had to shoot down 80 planes in a single mission. I returned this game after one play."
1,Just yucky,"I am no stranger flight games, both arcade and simulation, and this is a complete waste of money. Extremely high learning curve, it's impossible to control your plane, and unless you have a very big TV you won't ever even see the plane that kills you...again...and again...and again. It's not realistic and not fun. If you must have WW2 dogfighting, find a copy of Microsoft's Flight Combat Simulator, the first or second one will run on any PC made in the last ten years. You can fine-tune the realism from instant arcade action and immortality to a realistic 20 seconds of bullets and several hours of travel."
3,Grill ok service stinks!,"I bought one of these about 2 months ago. It worked great for about 3 weeks then I started having problems with low flame. After going through the trouble shooting in the manual to no avail I called the phone service for help. The person I spoke with was an idiot and was not much help other than ordering me a new valve/regulator assembly. Unfortunately they do not send any kind of directions for replacing this part. I had to take the grill half apart to replace this part with absolutely no guidance from char-broil. For someone who is not mechanically inclined this might have been a nightmare.The grill apears to be working now.When its working the grill looks and works great but I am leess than impressed with the build quality or service provided by charbroil.However, my understanding is that all of the manufacturers are racing to the bottom in terms of price point so the quality of grills has declined dramatically over the last few years."
1,Broke twice; uncomfortable headphones.,"1 month after purchasing this headset, the clip that holds the ear speaker onto the headpiece broke with ordinary use. I had to send it in for repair under warranty. Now it's 4 months later, and the microphone no longer works. I take care of equipment, and there was no reason for 2 things to break.Otherwise, the sound was good, though not mindblowing by any means. The headphones are stiff and uncomfortable.Overall, this product has been a lousy experience."
1,Boring Lame Adventure game,"We have a group of friends who get together every other weekend to play various adventure games while sitting in a group around a computer and taking turns at the mouse while using group strategy to complete the game.We have played tons of them... many from DreamCatcher.DARK FALL rates among the most boring.In fact we uninstalled it and threw it in the trash.The first and most annoying feature was the interface.In today's world of PC gaming, having static still shots of your environment (like early days of MYST) is lame.Realistic 3D environments where you can spin and get your bearings is the only acceptable interface for these types of games anymore...... a series of still scenes with no movement ability inside your screen is quickly disinteresting and detracts from the game.After about an hour, this game hit the trash can.There are much more engaging adventure games out there to have fun with"
4,good fun,"Not difficult but very entertaining. Turn off your lights to play this one, sound effects will give you butterflies! Too short, wish it had gone longer.Good things about game:1. the apparitions teamed up with the sound effects were creepy.2. a lot of rooms to investigate3. some puzzles were a bit tricky4. lots of time spent by the makers writing letters giving lots of background to the story.Not so good things about game:1. A LOT of rooms to investigate - a bit redundant2. A LOT to read!!! (but you don't have to read most of it to get through all the puzzles, I skimmed most of it)3. short short short4. what was that thing on the train platform for???"
1,Meh.,"Save up a few more dollars and get yourself something nicer. This is not worth the price. Cheaply made. Gets a little damp and smells bad. Not what is pictured. I could have pasted cupboard lining paper on a cardboard box for a similar effect. On the good side, great customer service from the company."
2,It wasnt Earthsea,I mean honestly the movie was...ill use the word ok. But other then that this had nothing to do with the actual Earthsea book. Which is why I give this movie such a low score. The book Earthsea is really great...and calling this movie Earthsea just brings it down. At least have the decency to call the movie something else.
5,Tales From Earthsea,Another wonderful movie from a powerhouse of animation. It took no time at all and my kids were stuck to the screen While the stoy line isn't as strong as some past productions it did hold them from start to finish. We await the next new story!
1,Tales from Earthsea,"I would not by this product. The DVD ""region"" format is not compatable with standard US DVD players."
2,It was ok....,"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be like all other gibli films, but...in some ways it was and in others...not so much. ( sorry in advance for my spelling issues)Pros:beautiful art workGood story baseCons:The story line was to choppy, and it left WAY to many questions unanswered ( i have not read the books)The story is really slow and draging in some partsBig build up to....what? I think i missed it....i didnt get the ending at all.So over all if you like to just look at great art work, or you've read the books and know whats going on, this movie would be great, and i'm really sad that i have to say the storyline wasn't good."
5,Awesome,"This movie is amazing. I know some people say that it was horrible, but you have to watch it with an open mind. This movie takes place after the cycle, not during.The art is beautiful and detailed, the voice overs are great, and I love the story. Goro Miyazaki does have a few quirks to work out, but he will rise up to join his father as an amazing animator."
4,Good but not great,Well done overall. Not a classic but certainly worth putting in the line up of fun music. Good for travel.
3,A Little Short...,"I got this game like, 3 months ago, and the reason why I never play it it's because it's just not a game to rave on and on about. The graphics were a so-so, and the clothes- Ugh!:( The were so ugly! The game ended too quick- for me, at least. I didn't think the other Sims were too good either. You can't even see your Sim kiss or hug or tickle anoter Sim. Maybe They wanted it to be ''kid-friendly'' for the younngsters under 8. Well, I'm 11, so this game was a dud. You can't even build a friggin' house for cryin' out loud! And by the way, there are A WHOLE LOTA GLITCHES! It shouldn't have been in the stores! It was a big dud! And the pick-up lines- PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, I'm done critizing this game. Bye!"
3,One play only,"I've never tried other Sims games, but this one seemed pretty fun. My main complain, however, is that there is ONE way to play the game. You get to customize your character, your house and your pet, and that's it. This game has no re-play value, but it is kinda fun. Buy this for that long weekend roadtrip."
1,shrek racer (or whatever),"this game is boring,boring and oh boring!i do NOT recermend in if your want a driving game get grand theft auto.DO NOT BUY IT"
3,Pretty good,"Wow, this game is hot! I like it a lot. It's preety fun.And here comes the 'but'...But... well, some games are ment to be RPG (role player games) and some aren't. The sims shouldn't be an RPG. This is a good game, but I was expecting the sims like the ones on the pc. This is a pretty good game, but I give it 3 stars only because I think it should be more than just a RPG that you can finish in 3 days. The sims are more than that; they never end. (Well, except for the upcoming Sims 2 in which you can die of old age). I would love it if they came out with a sims for GBA like the PC one!Don't get me wrong, though, this is a great game."
3,Fun but dumb,Its fun but sometimes it is really irrataiting when the things is confusing. If I were you dont buy it rater buy urbs:sims in the city its alot more fun
1,PIECE OF ****,"Broke not two weeks after I got it. If it didn't break it would have been useful, but it did so it's not. It actually fell apart into pieces while it was just sitting there. Cheap materials, not even worth buying."
3,Allen Key Not So Good,"It's a good price, but a pain to build. Allen key didn't work, had to get another one from other projects. Other than that it does the job."
3,Good value,"I had seen this in another ad, and thought it would replace 3 baskets in my laundry room. It's very hard to put together, and I am an expert at that, but, once it's finished, I truly like it. It looks nice, and, as I said, replaces 3 plastic baskets in the laundry, and takes up much less room. Pockets could be larger, but are sufficient, except for having to bend down to get the last of laundry out. I am short-armed and this presents a problem, but I am satisfied with the product."
5,Great laundry basket!,Each of the 3 compartments holds almost a full load of laundry. The unit is skinny enough for a small laundry room. It was easy to put together and slides around the room effortlessly. I recommend this -- great price and great product!
2,Cheap Solution,"This cart is cheaply made in that the wheels fall off after less than six months and the screws come loose, giving you the feeling it'll fall apart. If asked, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Sophisticated and Smart,"the Weakerthans' 3rd album is simply a joy to listen to. The music is not too hard and almost poppy, but in a sophisticated way. The lyrics are again superb. Not the stupid love songs but songs with actual ideas and smart language tricks.My favorite song is 'One Great City!' about their hometown of Winnipeg. I guess a city you love to hate."
2,Another weakly-plotted school story,"This is another of Wodehouse's early school stories, with a weak, coincidence-driven plot. It's his fourth book; the characterization and plot are a little less weak than in the preceding three, but it's still for Wodehouse completists only. The style is vaguely amusing, but with almost nothing of his later genius."
4,A great all rounder,"A perfect book to get you started in your digital audio endeavors.Filled with practical information about almost anything involved ,honest and well grounded.Chapters on acoustics, toolkit,setup, installation-configuration,simple songmaking guide, recording, effects,midi control,mixing-mastering, audio for videos and a DVD full of tools and extras, make it clear that it is a book to be used.Having read a handful of similar books I can't be certain but for me this is almost perfect"
2,AUTHOR NEEDS TO DO RESEARCH,"CYNTHIA BASS HAD THE ELEMENTS AND THE RIGHT CHARACTERS FOR WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A SWEEPING EPIC. AT BEST IT WAS A FAST READ. NOT MUCH TAKES PLACE ABOARD TITANIC, SINCE SUMNER SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME IN HIS ROOM, NOT INTERACTING WITH THE INTERESTING CHARACTERS. WHICH MAKES A READER CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM. AND THE SINKING MAY AS WELL HAVE BEEN ABOUT ANOTHER SHIPWRECK. SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT DESCRIBE THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC."
4,GREAT SECOND NOVEL,"The main reason I read this book was because I enjoyed this author's first novel so much (""Sherman's March""). I also am a bit of a Titanic fan ever since reading, ""Raise the Titanic"" as a kid. As the other reviews point out, this is not a Titanic fanatic's book. It's closer to the Jack and Rose story from the recent movie, ""Titanic"". But it also discusses the often overlooked and under appreciated social issues involved, such as class distinction and ""women and children"" first. The Titanic went down before the World Wars and the many inventions which came along. It was a time of unreal riches (before an income tax!). Bass really captures the feel of that era and weaves the characters in a very entertaining way. You will not get the details of the sinking of the ship (see a ""Night To Remember"" for that). But you will get a better feel for what real people might have felt and experinced at this time in history.It is an enjoyable read."
2,Simply Hellish,"This book had a fair chance to be engaging - the plot centered on a young-ish woman tackling career and love in modern London. Unfortunately, though, the book never engages the reader because of uneven transitions and a flat plot line. The main characters fail to evoke sympathy of any kind, and all attempts at wit are awkwardly contrived. My pain-staking effort to reach the last page left me with that sick feeling of eating too much cotton candy. In other words, I want those hours of my life back."
2,Does not work with Windows 7,"Was able to return and get a refund, which is good but was a pain. Did not work with window 7 64 bits"
4,a good solid debut,Neneh Cherry came out strong on this debut.Buffalo Stance was the jam.she had her own style from the get up.she deserves more respect than she has gotten.her music and style sounded like no other then or now.
1,Seriously?,I am having a hard time with the fact that I spent $35 with shipping for this DVD. My daughter has autism and she is 4. This is basically an aerobics video. Nothing to attract her attention at all. I cannot believe this is what the video is.I'm wondering if all of the postitive feedback is from the same person.
4,Good,It's a pretty fun game and you can see how they built the future games off of it and improved it.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this game. There were some improvements over the first game but not many and the bugs in this one really cancel the improvements out. I really enjoyed playing the first game. With this one I found Harry harder to control and this made some of the challenges very frustrating because it was difficult to get Harry to move the way I wanted him to and for my spells to go the direction I wanted them to (Even with targeting). The graphics disappear in many places. This game really feels like the makers rushed to get it out and did not do a lot of quality control before releasing it.
4,Very good CD,"I'm a tenor singer's fan and Armiliato it's not my favorite by far, but he has a special way to say the frases to express!! and i like it, this cd it's a very good example how a good voice can develop with time and a good technique!!I recommend this CD it's very very good!!!"
2,What a Snoozefest,"I am a huge Nancy Drew game fan and its rare that I dislike one of the games. This one whoever, she's an exception.The art somewhat stiff at times and the characters are somewhat dull all except for the artist and the girl who you help. But this game is too short and it doesn't keep us guessing like Nancy games usually do. Usually, it takes me a few days to solve a Nancy Mystery but this only took me two hours! I was really disappointed."
2,Disappointing and Dumbed Down,"I am a fan of the Nancy Drew games, but this one was a disappointment. The game has a map interface that takes Nancy directly to her destination, which means no more wandering around for Nancy. Also, there is not nearly as many ""things"" to look at; instead many clues are ""given"" to Nancy by contacts on her cell phone. There was no ""night time"" alarm clock which takes away Nancy's opportunity to explore when people are not around; it also takes away much of the thrill and fear of ""being caught."" There wasn't much suspense in this game either and the mystery was very easy to solve. I gave the game two stars because my game was not buggy, things worked like they were supposed to and the villian was difficult to guess. I do think that Her Interactive should stick with their older formats: Ghost Dogs and the Haunted Mansion were great, suspensful games that required a detective to crack the case."
4,Entertaining Game,I have played all the Nancy Drew PC Games so far and this is one of my favorites. I like the variety of challenges from the usual mystery-solving activities to the mini-games. The story and the characters are well written for a PC game. And the game is designed to become spookier as you get closer to solving the mystery of the Haunted Carousel. I recommend it for everyone from age 10 and up.
3,Very Short,"Is it just me or is this game really short? It only took me 5 hours to complete this game, it's only my second game, but maybe I should update to senior level in the next one. Other than that, great game, I know there's better and longer Nancy Drew software out there! I would suggest this game for younger children unless you choose the senior level, or this is your first Nancy Drew mystery, probably the easiest to start on."
4,High School Review,"This is a fascinating view of a woman who has been stereotyped throughout history as a grandmotherly type, comfortable and full of fluff as as a pillow, when in actuality Martha Washington was a far more complex, interesting,and strong, person than we have been led to believe. This book has been well researched and gives a good account of what it was like to have lived in this time period. I teach at an all girls' school and we are considering it for summer reading. We are interested in our students studying about powerful, strong , dynamic women. Helen Bryan's book certainly gives us a new and richer perspective on an old icon of American history."
4,Well written historica story,First Lady of Liberty is an informative & interesting read.Great insight in the trials & tribulations of life in the 1700.Easy to read historical story of an amazing woman.
4,MARTHA WASHINGTON:FIRSAT LADY OF LIBERTY,"I have always loved American history. This story of the first lady of this country is fairly rare. She was a real leader of the other wives in this period. It includes the power women possessed during these times. She was responsible for the education, health.and generaly ran the plantation when George was away. Lots of real history about prerevolution in America. It seems to be a very revealing story."
1,Not worth the trouble,"This ""history"" of Martha Washington could use a lot more in the way of scholarly research. It uses a lot of anecdotal material found in letters and diaries, but, quite frankly fails to give us a convincing picture. Also, one gets the feeling as one reads this book that the author has very little sympathy for early American history. Perhaps Ms. Bryan has lived a little too long in Britain, but for this American her touchiness on social issues of the 18th century seem totally removed from the events of that period. There is a sort of creeping left wing bigotry and latent feminism that keeps percolating up from the bowels of this book, rendering any scholarly point of view totally impotent. I wonder if any of the men and women of the present day would come off any better if they were subjected to this kind of scholarly Stalinism."
1,Zero Stars,"This item should be rated zero stars. I wish I had never purchased it. I hope no one else buys it. It is possible to put it on the faucet but then when you turn on the faucet, water sprays out from the point of attachment and then it pops off. Looking on the bright side, it probably would work well if it were caulked onto the spigot. If you are considering this product, I would recommend giving the money to someone with a ""Will work for Food"" sign instead."
1,Bath Spray Attachment,"Disappointed in this purchase; doesn't fit the faucet without spewing water everywhere. Good thing I didn't spend too much on it; however, still a waste of money."
1,a-w-f-u-l,"This is a book because it has a cover.Inside, you get 140 pages of tiny layout designs and text justification patterns, page number positioning (!), column layouts, page geometric divisions.... this is NOT inspirational at all, at least for a standard ""no awards"" designer like me...This is a collection of obvious stuff, even Microsoft Word page wizards can be much more creative than this.Do not waste money, I will really like to suggest you the Krause's ""IDEA INDEX"" book, that is another planet."
3,it's got some great ideas,"visually structured (good), very little editorial content (not-so good). it's a fair reference guide and not too expensive."
3,Solid solo effort,"This album is a good listen for you hardcore rap fans despite the last song ""All I Do"". He shows some true heart on ""I'm so tired."" That song is an anthem for those struggling through life. ""Tear it up"" is a solid track that'll get you crunk. The rest of the songs are solid. Good album Magic."
1,what OS,"I won't take a chance on buying anything that doesn't state what operating system is required. Yes, I understand that most manufacturers have download support, but it is usually a hassel. Please include in your sales write up what operating system drivers are provided with the product.."
1,SMARTDISK FDUSB-TM2,"I had purchase this product because I needed a floppy drive and their website mentions it was compatible with Vista O/S. When I recieved the floppy drive it just would not work with my Vista O/S it kept asking me to insert a disk in the drive when I already had a disk in the drive.I also notice the Smartdisk box had no printed any notice on the box itself to be use in any Vista O/S. I guess it was take your chance.Printed were 98e to XP.But the FDUSB-TM2, FDUSB-B2 did not work on my Vista O/S.Perhaps it may work on yours.I guess it would be great for XP users and take your chances for yourVista machines."
4,SmartDisk Titanium 2x USB External Floppy Drive,Since I still use floppy disks it is handy to move from computer to computer. It is plug and play which saves time. The only gripe I have is the short cord makes an extension cord necessary on most computers.I have used this model for a few years and I purchased this one as a back up as the floppy disk is going the way of the dinosaur.
1,Horribly slow,"I've worked with other thumb drives in the past, and this one is far and away the slowest that I've seen. On my Kingston Data Traveller, I can transfer 8gb in about 5 minutes. The same transfer takes over 30 minutes on the Corsair Flash Voyager 16gb. Performance is similarly horrid in all other respects as well. I have a Microsoft Virtual PC on each of the thumb drives. Performing any function on the Kingston takes ""x"" amount of time, while the Corsair takes anywhere from ""5x"" to ""7x"". In general, it's about 6 times as slow.Don't buy this piece of junk."
3,"Fast read/write, but the casing....","Very happy with the capacity and read/write speeds, but that rubber casing drives me crazy. Lint, dust, fuzz, and grime stick to it like a magnet. Profile of casing is not slim enough to squeeze between two USB plugs in a vertical side by side situation."
1,ReadyBoost Ready! NOT!,"I purchased this item specifically to use with my Vista PC and enable the drive for Readyboost. The alleged ""Hi-Speed"" USB drive doesn't meet Microsoft's requirements and I now cannot use it for the sole purpose of purchasing it. Funny thing, 1 GB SD card does meet readyboost requirements. Of course that SD card isn't made by Corsair.I've got lot's of spare storage devices. Oh well, guess I've got another."
3,Its pretty OK,"I have the FlashVoyager 8GB non-GT version with a rubber casing and blue grip on the sides. The device picks up speed while data is being written; but I expected it to be faster than other USBs. The rubber cap is quite loose and if I jerk it hard, it flies off. So thumbs down on the cap design -- I wish there was a locking mechanism for the cap.Otherwise, a good 8GB model."
1,Don't expect this to last...,"This product works, until it breaks on you. I had this for maybe 3 months before the housing became loose and I had to get a new one. My advice is to get one that is more sturdy than this."
3,Nice portable USB flash drive,"Its a great USB flash drive to carry around, its rubberized outside makes it better likely to handle drops. Also easy to grip. Its not as fast or as slim as the Sony 16gb flash drive but I feel this would be better to carry around then the Sony or the Cruzier flash drive. Also its a bit bulky so on a crowded USB hub you may have to remove some thing for it to fit."
4,Great Flash Drive,If you can live without having a place to put the top cap and possibly losing it then you'll love this 16 GB flash. Imagine 16 GB...some old laptops have less space.lolVery small note: the lanyard was sewn incorrectly - it will not 'sit' properly around my neck.
5,Does the job...,It's a memory stick... The speed is very good compared with other USB Sticks that I have. And 16 GB gives you plenty of room. I use it to have MP3s in the car (BMW has a USB port option where you can plug in a USB stick) and it holds more songs than I would ever want to play while on the road.
5,Sturdy USB Flash Drive,"I am a person who uses his flash drives as if they are all invincible. In fact I own 4 different flash drives and even the cheapest one is still going good. In fact most of my flash drives are in horrible cosmetic conditions because I just throw them around, store them in places never meant to be store. Now about this drive. The construction on this one is simply amazing. Considering that it costs around the same with the other drives (talking about 32GB here), this is a catch. So far I had this drive hooked on to my key-chain and I haven't lost the cap yet. The cap is actually tightly secured so I am not expecting to lose it for a while. I read a review that someone accidentally washed this drive in the washer and it survived. I can see why. The cap is water proof tight. There are no gaps or holes either. If you are looking for a sturdy drive get this one. Bad things don't happen to flash drives anyways - unless the person using them does something horrible to them!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought the Corsair FlashVoyager because it seemed reliable and customers liked it across the board. I had it for only 7 months and it died 2 minutes after loading some files on to it. Some may say it is a user error, but I went out of my way to treat it with respect like all my other technology. I even hounded Corsair for 2 months for a new cap after I lost mine. A crappy knock off, Walgreens flashdrive I purchased in 2009 worked longer than this one, at about 2 years. Save your money and go with a different brand that you can trust like Patriot."
1,Corsair 64 GB Flash Drive,"I had to return the product as it would not format. When communicating with the seller, I was advised that once received, they would replace the product and reimburse me for the return postage. Instead of doing that, they issued a full refund for the original purchase price and shipping charges but not the $4.95 I paid to return it. When I questioned them on this, they advised that I could pay them $80 through PayPal and they would ship me another flash drive. I have difficulty in doing business with people that do not honor their commitments even though I was reimbursed minus the additional charges I had to pay. That seems to be unprofessional and quite frankly, I do not trust them to follow through since their word is obviously not good."
2,Corsair 8GB Flash Voyager USB drive,"The device works very well, but the cap is very loose so it is easy to lose it if you carry it in your pocket."
4,"Good product, but one problem","This is a solid flash drive- good capacity for the price, durable build, have been using it for a long time with no technical problems. It's a little fat because of the rubber, but still haven't had a problem sticking it into crowded USB ports.One word of warning though:Unless you reformat the drive to FAT mode (which according to the nerds out there will shorten it's lifespan and reliability considerably), you can only put files under 4 gigs a piece onto the drive. I bought it specifically to put large 6-7 gig video files on it, only to find out it won't take them.That information was not in the product description, I had to learn it the hard way, and have the reason why explained by looking on Google. I don't really have any need to carry 8 gigs of small files around at any time (I can use my old 4 gig drive for small files), so it really doesn't suit the purpose I bought it for - which was to carry single, large files."
3,rubber doesn't mean rugged,"Things I liked about this drive:- capacity- speed- nifty blue light that blinks when data was transferringDidn't like:- The rubberized cap sometimes grips other things like denim more than it grips the smooth metal of the USB connector, so it would come off when I was taking it out of my pocket. I ended up switching it for a non-rubberized cap from another defunct USB.- It's just as vulnerable as any other USB drive in terms of getting bent/broken where the USB connector meets the body of the drive, and I guess I sat on it and bent it, and it ceased to work.Currently I'm looking at getting a Sandisk Cruzer with a metal body and retractable USB connector, and I don't foresee having this problem again."
3,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, TAKE NOTE OF A COUPLE OF ITEMS THOUGH:","OVERALL:I have owned three USB flash drives thus far (Kingston, 2 Sandisks). This one I have to say I feel most secure with due to its exterior qualities as well as 10 year warranty.PROS:1. Does the job: stores data and is very fast2. Rubberized exterior resists water3. Cap fits very securely on USB plugCONS:1. Rubberized exterior picks up any and all dust/pocket lint.2. Very bulky. If your Laptop/PC has USB ports side by side it will impede the open slot. Yes there is an adapter available, however, it is just a bit of an inconvenience to have to connect and reconnect this adapter each time I want to use the USB flash drive.MY RECOMMENDATION:Prices are always dropping for these items. If you can purchase for under $30 I think this would be a good deal and well worth the investment. Visit http://portableapps.com/ if you want to use this USB flash drive to access applications that are not installed on PCs other than yours."
3,Big and slow,"Very big in capacity, but slow to transfer data, specially when dealing with many files (like back-ups) Tried to check my computer, but it was ot the case. Well protected, you can drop it and it bounce like a ball.If you are not in a hury to copy huge amounts of data, a good deal."
1,Worthless Junk,"I bought one of these drives two months ago and was hugely impressed by its storage capacity, speed, and rugged design. I would have given it five stars, and that seems to be why everyone does give it five stars or close to that. But today the drive crashed, and I lost completely a document on which I had been working all week. Who cares about how much data it can store and how quickly it loads? Who cares about the rugged rubber case or the lanyard? It lost my data in one split second, wiped out all my hard work, and that makes this less than useless. I would have been better off writing with a pencil on a pad of paper. So, if you want to play russian roulette with your data and end up losing it, by all means go ahead and pay ninety bucks for the privilege. Me? I'm going back to backing up data on DVDs. They might not be quite so portable, but I have yet to have a DVD wipe my data clean."
5,Rock Solid Flash Drive,We purchased a couple of discounted flash drives from a local store that both promptly failed. We use the Corsair Flash drives at work so I bought one of these for my personal use. They just work and the're fast too. Very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.
5,LOVE MY MINT,BOUGHT THE EXTRA CUBE TO ENLARGE THE AREA IT COVERS.WORKS GREAT!I USE IT EVERY COUPLES OF DAYS AS I HAVE WOOD FLOORS AND IT GETS THE DUST UP AND KEEPS MY FLOOR CLEAN.
4,good single-great price!,"From Taja Sevelle and R J Rice (POE) comes a great single, with reggae bass and Nymph-like vocals.(Contains bonus non album track)"
2,Mostly dissappointed,"Not withstanding the cover, this book has excellent photos inside as well. However, as a fingerstyle guitarist and an admirer of Chet's music I was extremely disappointed with the transcriptions. I purchased this book mainly for the arrangement of Vincent (Starry, Starry Night). I've listened to Chet's performance of this great song and watched him play it numerous times on video. This book does not represent Chet's playing of the piece. If you are a guitar player I do not recommend the book. However, if you want some great stories of Chet and some pictures it does have some positives."
2,LOUD!,"I'm a college student, and I saw this nerf gun during a trip to Target. I thought it would be a great toy to shoot my suitemates with. I was really excited until I tested it out. First the gun is EXTREMELY LOUD. You have to pump the lever several times in order to launch the balls. This makes sneak attacks impossible. Also, the plastic gear comes into direct contact with the balls, so they will wear out. I would not recommend this for kids. It requires a lot of strength to pump the gun and it's REALLY LOUD!"
3,Interesting read but...,"This was a pretty blatant ripoff of ""The Girl Who Owned a City"" by O. T. Nelson. It was probably out of copyright by the time this was written but the entire premise is the same. This book takes a different tact and takes place later after the disaster so the problems are somewhat different but if you like this story I would encourage you to read the trilogy because it is still entertaining, then go get ""The Girl Who Owned a City"" by O. T. Nelson and see how great a book that really is."
3,"Interesting, Unrefined","This book is at times both fascinating and insightful. However, it also contains an unbelievable amount of typos. Due to the countless grammatical errors, awkward prose, and confusing diction, certain sections of this book are almost unreadable. The foreword (which was written by a PHD) also lead me to believe this book would be more scholarly in tone. The prose in several sections is much more sensationalistic than academic."
4,Rogaine with foam,"Dries quickly, so no long lasting wet looking patch of hair. This is a clear advantage if one needs to go out soon after applying the product."
2,Minimal results,"I used the Rogaine foam faithfully/consistently for 7 months, but I did not see much difference at all. It must be my bad luck to be in the 15% of the population for which this product does not work. That being said, if you're going to try it, here are some things to keep in mind (which other reviewers have noted, as well):1. You have to apply the stuff twice a day for the rest of your life, or at least as long as you want to try to thicken your hair. Although it's not the worst discipline, I grew weary of having to do it. Too much trouble, I found.2. It's expensive.3. As others have said, it works best just to spray it directly on the crown of the head.4. I don't think the odor is bad. It dissipates after a few minutes, anyway.5. Definitely use the foam, not the liquid solution. The liquid solution is horribly messy.Hope you have better luck than I did."
2,Doesn't work,After 4 months no difference. Guess I am part of the 15% for which this doesn't work. Have switched to liquid as have read that it is better.
4,Required Read-Interesting Read,This was a required book for a class I was taking but in the end it was very interesting. Easy to read. Diagrams and pictures were cool. If you are at all interested in Native American customs buy it and thumb through it. Recommended.
5,Sims Bustin Out,"Thanks to Amazon and the provider of this game, these young adults of mines have been on this game non-stop. Among game systems Game Cube still is a favorite and glad games are available, they are please and always looking around for what they like to purchase. Thanks for shipping over here where we are trying to adapt to a new language and atmosphere, this game brings them back home and keeps them busy. We would purchase from this buyer again, it works very well and in good conditon."
5,good fit and sounds great,"for some reason this unit would not turn on for a couple of hours after i loaded it for the first time. since then it has worked excellent, it fits well and i have a large neck and head and the eq does give u a wide range. it is also ez to use the buttons while wearing it."
4,Eagles Cry Blood,I related to one of the stories because I was the Special Forces Detachment Commander that assumed command the day after one of the incidences. Donald Zlotnik was the Executive Officer of that particular Special Forces Camp during the insurrection.
2,Not as good as you might think...,"Because I purchased this CD based on the two previous reviews, I feel compelled to write my own.AFTER THE STORM is not a bad reissue, but nearly lifeless. Recorded in Nashville with second-string session musicians, this appears to be a sincere attempt at reviving Wynn's career. However, the tepid arrangements and unispired playing mimic the MOR sound popular in Music City in the mid-seventies.I highly recommend THE VERY BEST OF WYNN STEWART 1958-1962 to anyone interested in some rightous California honky-tonk. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Fantastic album for anyone --- but especially Cracker fans.,"I'd been meaning to pick up a Camper Van album for years, since the first Cracker, but never got around to it. Finally, I chanced upon Key Lime Pie for a great price and picked it up. It is a fantastic album, and perhaps one of it's most amazing features is that, although release in 1989, it sounds like it could've been release today. And listening to it and then Cracker's latest, Gentleman's Blues, you can absolutely sense incredible similarities. David Lowery is far too publicly underrated, and it's time you give him your props by buying his albums! It's a win-win situation. Key Lime Pie is jumping and beautiful."
3,Tie,"Unless you have a small neck, don't buy this product. The tie itself is very nice, but it is very, very short and I can't use it."
3,The New Successful Coin Hunting,Good book for beginners but a bit antiquated. Many of the ideas for locations to hunt are very good. The book really is an excellent advertisement for Garrett Detectors.
2,Use Caution,"Use caution if you order this product. I have this one, along with all the other DVD comic collections (Fantastic Four, X-Men, Hulk, and Avengers), and while it's much nicer to have all this stuff on one DVD rather than 16 CD-ROMs, I have had many problems with this one. Specifically, of the 40-some different DVD drives I've tried this disc on the PC, not one of them could see any files on the DVD other than a folder with ""1960""s stuff in it. At first I thought I had a defective disc, but after I tried it in a MAC DVD drive, the entire disc came up without a problem! I suspect it has something to do with the dual layering and PC drives not being able to read one of the layers. It seems they didn't do a very good job at product testing to make the DVD able to be read by different kinds of DVD drives. So unless you have access to a MAC that can burn PC/Windows DVDs, you may be out of luck on being able to read all the files on this disc."
2,I love Jay Farrar/Son Volt but...,This stinks like rotten sardines. Horn arrangements? Organs? Almost as bad as later period Wilco? This is bad.
2,Two out of pity,19 reviews for this album? Wilco's Sky Blue has been out a few weeks and already 155 reviews. That says it all.
3,IT'S LENNY,"Another reviewer said ""He seems to know precisely what he wants to say on this album; trouble is, it's all been said before."" My response to that is this, how many rock bands out there today are doing something that HASN'T been done before? How many rock bands are actually unique and different? We all know the REAl answer is NOT MANY!If I only purchased CDs of artists or bands who are doing something that hasn't been done before then I wouldn't have the chance to buy many CDs. NIRVANA, for all their popularity, were doing NOTHING new. Sorry folks, calling it Grunge did not make it new. Same with Pearl Jam. If you like Lenny, get the CD and make up your own mind. If you don't like Lenny then it doesn't matter how original he may or may not be. It's not rocket science folks!"
1,Waste of Money,Microphone doesn't work on this headset. It is only good for listening music. You can't use this for making calls.
1,defective by design,"The sound quality of this product is okay but not spectacular. I sent mine back to Amazon because it won't connect automatically with my Galaxy Tab. It pairs beautifully. But that is different from establishing an active connection. Every use has to start with Settings->Wireless->Bluetooth->Connect->Home->Music. With my fat fingers, that is a non-trivial demand."
5,Excellent Headset,"I've had this headset for a little over 2 months. It shipped quickly ( despite being during the holiday season). It's a very sturdy headset, extremely comfortable even over hours of play (even with glasses). Great Battery life and the 8 last paired memory makes pairing with your most common bluetooth devices simple and easy. I would recommend this headset to anyone who needs a stereo bluetooth headset or is replacing an older one."
3,"Good Sound, Easily Breaks","I rarely write reviews. These bluetooth headphones sound the best. I bought and returned 2 others. I was really happy with them. On par with the new Beats by Dre Wireless (less base). Way better than anything in the sub $150 price range. I definitely recommend for this reason.The only downsides are that the buttons on the headphones are difficult to use. They're really small and not intuitive when they're on your head and you can't remember which button is which.Most important, after a few months of usage, I went to pull them out of my drawer and the plastic the attaches the cans to the headset broke in half. It's the 'U' shaped plastic around the cans. It just broke. Probably because this plastic has a little groove in it for the wire. Totally weak. Not sure what to do so going to beg to Sony to get me some new ones. Horrible design for this reason alone.Otherwise, they fit great, comfortable, sound good (for wireless) and decent price."
2,Not for iPhone,"The sound quality is good WHEN it works. Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I can't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset don't control the iPod/iphone? I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back. It is also worth mentioning that you can't use regular rechargeable batteries. It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for. Oh goodie, something else to recharge and keep up with. Not worth the headaches."
3,"Great for listening, not for speaking","In general I'm super pleased with these headphones as a listening device. They are comfortable and flexible, with good sound (I'm not an audiophile, but they certainly work for my needs).That said, I'm very disappointed with the quality of the microphone; I have used these several times to try to make phone calls, but 98% of the time the person on the other end says that I'm so hard to hear (garbled and/or not coming through) that it's impossible to have a conversation. The 2% of the time that works are when I'm in a perfectly quiet, indoor room. Then things are passable.Don't buy these if you need them to be able to talk on the phone. If you're just looking for a comfy pair of headphones to listen to audio wirelessly, these should fit the bill."
2,"Nice headphones, terrible microphone","I bought this headset wanting to be able to roam freely about the house while listening to music and/or talking to my parents on Skype. Unfortunately, it does neither well. The range in my house is less than 5 metres for listening, and once I walk out of range, it disconnects and must be re-paired and set up on the computer again. However, when it does work, the sound is impressive.The microphone is a complete joke. The sound comes through extremely garbled and while it seems to have a hard time picking up my voice while I am wearing them, it detects and amplifies the shrieks of my children on the other side of the house. I tried phoning on Skype as well as through my cellphone, and both times the recipient said that my voice was barely intelligible.It's a shame, as I had my heart set on these microphones for months, but they are going back tomorrow."
5,Great Wireless Headphones.. Buy These..,these are the second pair i bought.. the first ones went to my older daughter and these go to my younger daughter.. they work perfectly.. great Headphones.. buy them and you will be happy.. oh yeah they work over like 20 feet and behind walls..something you might need to know.. she uses a Toshiba laptop and we had to download the Realtek Sound Drivers from Toshiba support to make the Bluetooth work.. that's of course because the Toshiba did not come with Bluetooth we had to add the Trendnet Bluetooth USB Adapter TBW-107UB..
3,Too small Too tight...,"They look big and comfortable in the picture, but are a bit smaller in reality.That's my only complaint.For wireless headphones they sound good, though, compared with my other five sets of wired headphones, they don't stand a chance.I don't use them anymore. They just sit on a shelf in my office. I've loaned them out to friends to see if they would buy them from me, but everyone agrees that they are too small and tight. I can't even sell them for half price.Might be better for a small child's head as opposed to my giant man head."
4,Great headset,"I was able to pair this set with my Chocolate cell phone, and Axim 30 PDA. No static and very good fidelity. Ear cups are a very good fit.On the down side. I found the controls a little too small for my fingers."
4,was very helpful,"this book really helped me, and for the most part, helped me be successful in potty training my son! I really was getting frustrated, but the principles in this book helped cut down on that frustration quite a bit. I also liked how the author seemed to have an accurate and compassionate view of little children."
3,Well....,"I think this is as much for a parent as it is child. I think if my daughter were older, we would have had success. She's 2 and has been showing signs of readiness for a couple of months, but not completely ready. Sorry, but I don't know how else to say it. For us, it did not work, but I think the thought behind the process is spot on. Right now we are doing the pull-up method and having some success and I think in a couple of weeks we will give this another shot."
4,potty training in 3 days,I found this book helpful. It was a quick read with many helpful tips for potty training.
2,Warning: do not proceed without reading this first,"If you were planning on potty training after 2 1/2 this book will make you feel like a monster for waiting. We got suckered doing it even though our instincts were to wait, it ended up being a horrible experience for everyone. The authors rigid perspective does not account for the possibility of anything deviating from her plan, so when it does not go as planned you are on your own. The technique requires you to connected your child's pride to being potty trained, so going back to diapers is not an option unless you are OK with really messing with your kid. It took us 8 horrible days with this method to potty train - not worth it. If the child is actually ready this technique probably would work, but don't be fooled by the authors timeline and checklist for determining your child is ready. The author is not the authority she pretends to be."
2,What a joke!!,"I have friends that swear by this book. Bought it a year ago and my son still isn't potty trained. We have tried on 9 different long weekends and even a whole week with grandma to use this approach. Guess what....all we get is a pile of wet and poop underwear to wash. This ""maybe"" would work if you did it at the EXACT moment your child was ready to potty train. Good luck finding that moment.PS - I have found copies of the same book on the internet you can download for free. Don't waste your money."
4,Great Game,"The Sims Bustin Out is a awsome game. Its alot like the first one except now you can go to many diffrent places like a club, gym,army base and many others. The free play is very fun and the get a life can get challenging. This game has also added a ton of new furnisher and other house things to the game like they have a train set a high dive and the sims can do flips off the high dive. You can also do new things like tell other sims to pull your finger or you can towel snap them. The only downside to this game is you cant drive the cars they just show the sims on the car driving. You also cant build two story houses like in the computer version. This is a GREAT game."
5,Sounds like a great game!,This game has to be good. The SIMS for the PS2 and XBox was great. Now you can get out and explore other places?!?!? This sounds like an awsome game!!!!
4,just ok,"It is just ok ,Not super good ,but fine ,if i have other better choice will be good .Thanks anyway!"
1,BE CAREFUL BUYING USED ITEMS!!,"This item practically never function. Bluetooth is damaged, only restoring pairing mode, one time was successful. After that, never can be used (in 4 months). Obviously this was the reason because seller offer this article...... dishonest!!!!Trying to obtain some support form him....nothing... BE CAREFUL BUYING USED ITEMS!!"
4,Good value bluetooth headset/headphones for iMac and iPhone.,"I use the Sony DR-BT21G headset with both my iMac and my iPhone (using the Sony TMR-BT8iP bluetooth transmitter). I use them with my iPhone for running, walking, working out, and house cleaning. They have good iPod audio quality and excellent phone call quality on both sides of the conversation. The controls are good: volume, pause, track fwd/REV, call answer/end. I like the way they fold up for easy storage in my gym bag or backpack. I'd buy another one if I lost this one."
2,mission nightstand,"This is a cheap nightstand. Unfortunely I don't mean inexpensive.This nightstand came with a damaged side board. with the way it was packed(nicely)it seemed to have been put in that way. The replacement came faster than the company thought, but I still couldn't put this together for over about 10 days. It does not require 2 people to put it togther, although the instruction said so. I could hear the wood crack when I put the screws in. I bought this for a child, but if I had another choice I would not purchase it again."
3,Sheep Book,I'm not as happy with this book as I thought I'd be. I had seen it in a magazine and thought it might be good for my toddler but it really doesn't read very well and doesnt' seem to flow well.
5,Toddler's delight,"What makes Sheep in a Jeep such a delight to read is its unabashed use of onomatopoeia. Indeed, some of my daughter's first words were ""splash"" and ""thud"" as she recited along this favorite story.With every page Shaw's vivid vocabulary comes alive in perfectly-metered rhyme, adeptly complimented by Apple's whimsical illustrations. In a format just long enough to delight, and short enough to entertain, it's little wonder Sheep in a Jeep has been such a longstanding favorite.I can't recommend it highly enough for your own little ones, and it makes a great baby shower gift inclusion!"
1,not worth it,"my 2 year old loves books and i thought this would be a great one based on reviews. It's not for him, what 2 year old knows what weap, heap, etc is? The only words that rhyme in this book rhyme with sheep, the book is short, the pictures are cute and it is a cute overall story, but it just doesn't work for us....my 7 year old can read it and at least understand what the book is saying, but it's so short that it's over in a minute for him. thought it would be better."
5,great book!,my baby is only two weeks old but i wanted to start his library early--i don't know if he will like it but it's my favorite so far!
4,"Thrilling, suspenseful movie","I enjoyed this movie. It reminds me of Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins. John Malkovich perfectly plays Tom Ripley. He is the evil protagonist that you end up rooting for. The intrigue in the movie stems from an innocent Italian husband and father being pulled into the role of assassin as part of a sick game played by Ripley.The movie contrasts the sociopathic Ripley who easily justifies killing with a conscience-stricken picture framer who can't stomach killing others but learns to do it. The movie also shows the consequences of evil actions--that there is no such thing as getting away with it, even for the conscienceless Ripley.The acting is superb and the plot driven at a face pace. The events are realistic and not far-fetched like so many thrillers recently.With a main character like Tom Ripley, no one is safe in the movie. He is cast as very much like Hannibal Lector--the refined psychopath."
2,Even though I'm his biggest fan...,John Malkovich is creepy enough when he's NOT brutally murdering people. This movie is b-o-r-i-n-g.
1,Big Disappointment,"I am a person who is trying to learn how to make a knife. That's a pretty basic starting point. This is a very unprofessional video (poor quality) that shows you about half of what they are describing. The very point of buying the video is to be able to ""see"" how to do something. They certainly step through all the phases and throw out a bunch of words that I've never heard so that I know that they know what they are talking about. The problem is that ""I"" don't know what they are talking about. They only shoot close-ups about 1/2 the time, and they don't bother explaining some of the more basic concepts. I guess if you already know a decent amount about making knives, then this video might rank a 3, but it's still a poor quality taping. Buy a book - you'll get almost the same experience."
5,"This was a very good back in the day, cool jammin' tape. =)",I was in high school when this tape came out. It was a very good tape not slam talking women but good talking music to get your groove on doing the wop. I know you remember that dance with the hype. Well anyway I loved this tape and I hope there are many more.
3,Could be better ...,"I ordered this in Oct.08, an at the time there was no disclaimer saying that there isn't an over the door hook included. So I got it, and had to use a hook from my shoe organizer. Even with a hook, over time (it's been 7 months) it starts to droop down. I don't have much weight in it so it's a little weird it does this, an it always gets caught in the door because it doesn't stay put. They should obviously include a hook, the fact that they don't doesnt make sense. But what do you expect for the price, I can't be to upset."
3,Not sure about dental cleaning,"My dogs absolutely love these treats, but I'm not so sure about the dental benefits. The dogs don't seem to have any less tartar on their teeth although their breaths are a little fresher. I still need to use toothpaste and a toothbrush to clean their teeth and the harder rawhide type chews seem to work better on the tartar. I will still give these treats to my dogs because they really like the taste and texture."
5,Great product,"I use this in both aquariums. Works great. I test the water every few days and never any problems with ammonia, nitrite, nitrate. Does the trick!"
5,wonderful soothing nmusic.,"If you are looking for nice relaxing ""spa"" type musicto be able to unwind for the day this would be for you.It has awesome and very comforting music"
2,Where's the Volume?,"My son (1yr) doesn't think much of this toy, as it doesn't have much volume, it too quiet to keep his attention. If there is any other background noise (like the TV), it easily washes out this toy. So if he doesn't get any response from it, he simply moves along to the next toy in the basket."
3,Blu-ray leaves a lot to be desired,"The film is a wonderful, wonderful music but the film quality spoils the whole effect! After watching the entire film with his wife have come to the conclusion that he was shot with two cameras, part of the picture In the second part of HD without HD! My panasonic TC-P60 PLASMA GT30 with the player Panasonic DMP -BDT110P kept showing blu-ray picture alternately with inferior image quality is depended on the stage, and it bothers my eyes, and spoils the atmosphere of the whole movie! manufacturer should improve the quality of the movie or do not expose it as a blu-ray!"
2,Stretchy Inside-Out Balls,These paticular ones show being able to stretch over the head like a hat. But these ones were way too small for that. A little disapointing but they do fit on the feet so not all was lost.
5,HIS MASTERPIECE! RATES 10 STARS,"At an age when a lot of musicians are resting on their laurels and long past their best work both Dick Dale and Davie Allan have both released the best work of their careers. Dick Dale with his cd Spacial Disorientation and Davie Allan with Restless in L. A.. I'm 50 years old and first heard Davie Allan in the 60s' when the song Blue's Theme was a hit on top 40 radio. Out of the over 2000 cds I own, for the last month this is the one I listen to over and over,and instead of it getting old it just keeps getting better. For anybody that likes instrumental rock guitar [there are two vocals included] buy this cd and discover someone who deserves to be mentioned in the company of other guitar legends. I'm gonna go turn up the volume on the stereo and listen to ""Demente"" right now!"
1,Find another antivirus program,"I bought this antivirus program based on an online reviewer at a computer website who stated it was the tops in its field. However, be aware that Panda Titanium slows your processing down to glacial speed. I had had McAfee on my computer, and when the year subscription was up, decided to switch to something else. I now wish I had switched to something else besides Panda. I had to disable all the options except for one just to get the program to stop hogging all my memory (756K) and making my computer (a Dell 3000) run as slowly as a sloth in slow-motion. Save yourself the frustration and buy another product."
5,excellent,"excellent book, full of great ideas on how to process stress. great for any art therapist working with clients with traumatic stress"
5,"Excellent, unique story","My 2 year old loves this book. I like that it is different from the cookie-cutter children's stories out there. There are no nonsense words or oversimplification. The story is about an evening/night on a farm, and what the various people are doing at different times through the night. I especially enjoyed the episode of the mother nursing her baby during the night. As a nursing mother, I am always looking for books that depict real family events in an attachment parenting perspective. The illustrations are excellent; story provides a paragraph on what the family is doing, then an illustrated page of what the cat sees during the same time. My daughter likes to point things on the page that the cat saw, and this is such a natural, nice way to involve a child in the story. Kudos to the author."
5,Packed just as Sardines should be!,"Reese Sardines are packed true to the old saying, tightly! Now add the wonderful olive oil and one is eating very healthy. I add just a bit of onion powder to mine, sometimes garlic powder as well. Oh, and don't forget the cracked black pepper! on these gourmet sardines."
3,GRIM GREY UK,It is a next movie of a grim British reality Scottish-style while following a boy growing up into male-a school team coach (notHung) to be killed by his former accomplishers for no apparent reason.Is it an attempt to next time glorify the state-supported manipulative psychological services or convince public that British could produce movies not worse than Stanly Kubrick?What I like is a classic English used to present this mix of Shakespearean-style drama with the hooligan flick of the seventies.
3,Same questions as the First Edition,"As an early bar prepper, I was looking for as many practice questions as I could get my hands on. So, I bought both Finz AND the second edition Finz, in addition to other books. Both Finz books share many of the same questions.As for the rest of the material, the title lives up to its name. There are some great strategies and tactics for tackling the MBE. Finz provides tips for each topic individually.I recommend this book as an addition to your bar prep program. Just don't buy both editions hoping to get double the amount of practice questions."
4,Deep Forest,Wonderfully crafted single is a great buy for anyone new to Deep Forest. Highly suggested.
5,A Revelation,"If you're a fan of the Nuggets collections, this CD will be a revelation. I first heard ""I Don't Understand"" on Little Steven's Underground Garage on the radio a few weeks ago, and was blown away. These guys have got that '66 to '68 garage thing down perfectly. Apparently they've been doing it for about 25 years, and it shows on this record. They're not trying to _do_ retro music, this _is_ their music.The songs are consistently good, with lots of attitude, hooks and variety. Not a ballad in the bunch to disrupt the vibe. You'll hear echoes of Love's ""Seven and Seven Is"", the Stones ""Paint it Black"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction"", ""Gloria"" by Them, and Jefferson Airplane circa Surrealistic Pillow. Great stuff."
5,PERFECTION,"THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST ALBUM BY THE CHESTERFIELD KINGS! THIS IS THE LP THAT ABSOLUTELY SECURES THEIR REP AS ONE OF THE PREMIER AMERICAN ROCK AND ROLL BANDS EVER. LYRICALLY AND MUSICALLY THIS ALBUM IS A+ STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE. I'VE BEEN A FAN SINCE I FIRST HEARD THEM IN '82, BUT MAN OH MAN!, THIS LP HAS GOT THE 60'S GARAGE/PSYCH/ ROLLING STONES/ ROCK & ROLL IN THE POCKET WITHOUT THE POSER BS! THE PRODUCTION IS INCREDIBLE - I'M FLOORED BY THE SONGWRITING! ALSO, THEIR NEW GUITARIST PAUL MORABITO IS FANTASTIC. GET THIS ALBUM! - IT'S ESSENTIAL! PICK UP THEIR ""LET'S GO GET STONED"" LP/CD WHILE YOU'RE AT IT AS WELL! LONG LIVE THE CHESTERFIELD KINGS!"
1,Do not get that one,"I got the guide, because I like the Lonely planet books. Well, that one is an exception - there is nothing interesting or useful. use some other guide or go to turist information in the airport. Canaries are pretty civilized and there are not many surprises here, so maybe that is why the book is so thin and uninteresting."
4,good solid debut,"No more lies came out 10 years back and was banging.this album had good uptempo&Slow Jams like If.the Production was tight.it had strong R-N-B,Hip-Hop&Pop influence without sounding Crossed over.she should have blown up."
1,Do not buy!,This product was very cheaply made! 1. The holes in which the color-assigned rods go are not big enough and must be widened in order to put it together. 2. The rods are very flimsy and one of them snapped upon assembly and had to be taped. 3. The top brackets do NOT fit correctly and must be forced together. 4. The entire item is not sturdy- with or without clothing. I am disappointed with this item.
2,Made of toothpicks,"Pretty flimsy- snapped the lower legs on the second day. I just lowered the whole rack a little and it seem more stable. Maybe, design wise, it is just too tall."
1,Piece of junk,"The assembly was easy, but the product is flimsy and just pure junk. As soon as I assembled it, one of the wooden legs broke. If *minus rating stars* were available for use, this item would definitely fit the bill. The company should be ashamed of themselves for manufacturing it. Don't buy it!!"
1,DO NOT BUY - total junk!,"Even though it said it was made of wood, the wood is so thin that even with just underwear on it - it tips over with the weight. I bought two, used one once and threw the whole lot in the garbage - completely and utterly a waste of money!!"
1,You get what you pay for,"This is very poor quality. One of the rods broke after only a couple of uses. Fortunately, I also bought a sturdy chrome model for about $12 more and that one still serves me well."
4,wolverine runamuck here,"the hand, hydra, wolvie going crazy fighting the fantaSTIC 4, X MEN, DAREDEVIL, elektra was a good rerad love the satan references in here another plus was northstar getting killed but in marvel tradition death never works in thwe x men at least baron strucker will stay dead rest in peace to him wolvie's face off with rachel classic once again wolvie saiud he was'nt scared of dying he was in 2 world wars after all."
1,Worked ok for 3 months but now an expensive paper weight,I got this to replace a pump that failed just after hurricane Sandy. It worked ok for 3 months with intermittent use and had never been run dry but now the motor won't start most of the time and seems like it's trying to seize up. Not good for a pump this pricy after so little time. Avoid.
5,Works for me!!!!,This machine does a great job. I used it on an area rug- was awesome. I bought it to clean my couch. It does a good job there also.
4,Very Good for Price,I was surprised at how dry the carpet was when finished! Cord could be a little longer but worth the money.
4,Don't Buy a Bissel product!,"Have not received this product yet, but I saw an identical Bissel to my dead Bissel in the local dumpster - and I spent mad money getting my Bissel repaired at the local shop - nothing changed. Bissel is a HUGE waste of your money. ANYTHING but a Bissel is a good buy! Even sweeping up the doghair with your hands is a better deal than ANY Bissel!"
1,Don't waste your money,This carpet cleaner lasted one year. Used it five times. Never worked well enoughwithout spot cleaner first. Very dissatisfied
4,"Not perfect, but pretty darn good!","I've always liked Hoover products- when the price was right!- and the price on this carpet cleaner was just where I expected it to be. I believe others have reviewed this item and have mentioned some of the ""precautions"" you might need to take, and they WERE right! The hotter the water the better (boiling about 1/2 the amount is good), pre-spotting is best AND read the directions!! Nothing difficult, but it IS'NT like running a vacuum. Altogether, a very good product that does a more than decent job."
2,Where are the parts?,I received the steam cleaner without the necessary screws and bolts to complete assembly. The product manual does not explain the sizes and measurements of screws and bolts needed. I went to the Hoover website and ordered screws and bolts listed for the model I purchased. I received the parts from Hoover and of course the screws did not work!! Very Disappointed in lack of quality control...Will not purchase a Hoover product again!Sharon (CA)
2,Bad OCR in Kindle Version,"Not sure how much I like the book, it seems to run on a bit but the reason for the 2 star review is for the really poor translation into a Kindle version. Half the time one of the main character's names is Parn, the other half it is Pam. There are many other examples of these kind of close but not quite conversions that makes it quite distracting when reading, especially when you have to keep re-reading to make sense of it. Kindle version is well below what I expect."
2,Anatomy of a Murder,"My book club picked this book, Anatomy of a Murder, a true story it was set in our state, Michigan. I could not get into the book, despite many, many tries. Yet, many of the people in the club said it was slow until around page 53 and then it took off. Having read the first chapter, I am going to start it again - at page 55 - due to their reviews which were positive!Gerri"
1,not satisfied,"The tape I received was defective. The dances were not even in the right order. It started on about the 3rd dance and then went to the warmup. Tape caught in VCR upon removal. I tried to reach the seller, but received no response. I was just out the price of the tape and the shipping."
4,"Acer TravelMate 6460-6263 15.4"" Notebook review by customer S.A.",I love the machine but have 2 problems.The orbicam exe file stopped working within the first day.Vista business has a problem in saving files on sbs2003 . I can not save a excel file into any docs.????
3,It works - but....,"This seems to work very well.And, I am planning on buying a bunch more. (one for the car, one for the motorhome, 2 or 3 for the boat)The flaw is, one drop from a couple feet onto a hard surface and it splits open and spills hundreds of little balls all over the place."
4,"So far, so good!","I bought this product just over a month ago. I have excessive water build up in my basement laundry and a cement closet. I only bought one of these to try it out in the laundry, but I am so happy with it, I plan to buy another for the closet. It seems to be working in the time table that the company stated, I love that it doesn't take electricity to run, and it was MUCH cheaper than buying a bulky humidifier. Thanks to whoever discovered this jewel!"
5,Great Product for Small Spaces,"Works great in small spaces. Has prevented mildew problems in my closet. Needless to say, this was a HUGE problem! Purchased my first one towards the end of last winter and it worked so well, I purchased another. Currently, I use two of these eva-drys in my 100 sf closet. I don't have to worry about spilling or toxic chemicals, which is great. Totally worth the price. They work great and will last a long-time! Will probably purchase a couple more for other spaces."
3,Flawed design,"This item is a good concept but the small window that is used to check the color of the silica beads to see if it needs charging is a gray color and it's very difficult to see the color of the beads; frankly I can't see the color of the beads at all. I usually routinely charge it about once a month. At first I thought that there was some protective film over the window so it wouldn't get scratched, or I thought perhaps I had a defective unit. I called the company and this was not the case. It seems like it would be a no brainer to have the window clear so the beads color would be easy to see. I hope they improve this point."
4,does the trick,"I bought this to take camping and keep my tent from becoming muggy. It works quite well in that regard, but it is a bit bulkier than I expected. The included S-hook for hanging it is a bit easy to knock down from anywhere you would mount it but that is minor. It also requires quite a large area to be plugged in, most power strips won't accommodate it well. Good thing it doesn't need to be plugged in very often to dry out the crystals."
1,Does not work at all!,"Despite the mixed reviews on this product, I decided to buy it and give it a try for a small bathroom. It does nothing at all. I left it in the bathroom for a couple of weeks and the beads always stayed dark blue. The beads never turned pink to indicate that it was absorbing moisture. I sprinkled water on it to see if it would do anything......stayed dark blue with not one single pink bead showing. I laid a damp towel on top of it, completely covering this unit with the damp towel. IT NEVER CHANGED or gave any indication that it had absorbed any moisture! It's in my trash can now. At least it didn't cost very much but I'd not suggest this product to anyone."
1,0 stars - thumbs down,"I have a safe.I have a hygrometer.I have used various types of small dehumidifers in the safe.I saw this one and thought it would be great; IT WASN'T!I repeat: IT WASN'T!Absolutely no change in humidity in my safe based upon hygrometer readings using a hygrometer that I know works.The device is so simple, I can't think why it doesn't work - other than perhaps the silica used is defective.I do not know how other people say this is so great, unless I got one from a bad batch or something.waste of money.stay away.I suggest using the ones round metal ones that are rechargable in the oven. I used them for years with great success.Going to try and get my money back."
4,Good product!,Purchased this to keep inside our fire safe after noticing a musty smell on the paperwork insde. We have been using it for a little over two months now and it works great! It does get very warm when you plug it in and it is quite heavy for a standard plug but those are the only issues we have with the product. Keeps all the documents in the safe crisp and dry!
1,Does not work!,I bought this a few weeks ago and put it in my car because i have a lot of problems with moisture. It has not sucked up any water at all. The beads wont change color signifing that its working.
1,Not worth the time or money,Purchased this for a closet and haven't seen a change at all. Damp Ride works better and cost much less. Keep your money!!!!!
3,Eva-dry dehumidifier,"This thing is huge. I suppose there are dimensions of it somewhere on Amazon's page, but I was surprised when I received it how large it is. Decided not to hang it.I can't really tell how well it works. I bought it because my studio apartment stays rather humid, but it's too small to warrant purchasing a larger, more expensive dehumidifier. I have owned it for about a month, and it has not yet turned to pink crystals (ready to be recharged). It is placed by my heating unit, which appears to be the source of the problem, and I have seen less condensation (and resulting mold...eww), however, I also stopped using the heater so much... Combined effect, perhaps?Moral of the story-- it's probably suited better to a smaller space, like a closet."
4,So far so good,"I have only had the EDV-500 for a few weeks, so it hasn't passed the test of time but so far so good. I really like the concept; it seems like the perfect solution to a small damp area such as a closet."
5,Great product!,We have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great! When it changes color all I do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again! We are very satisfied!
4,Worked better than expected in my keg fridge!,"I purchased this about a month ago for a beer keg refrigerator that kept collecting standing water on the bottom. I would use towels to soak up the half inch of water from the bottom of the fridge, but when I would open the fridge to check it again a week later, the water would always be back. Since I put this de-humidifier into the fridge a month ago, the fridge is still completely dry, and the beads have yet to change color at all, so I haven't yet had to ""recharge"" the dehumidifier. It's done just what I needed it to do. I'm very pleased with this purchase.---UPDATE---To my surprise, it was over 7 months before any moisture appeared in the bottom of the fridge again. I plugged in the Eva-Dry for about a day and a half (until I could see pink beads again), and put it right back in the fridge, which has been dry ever since (1 month and counting)."
5,Excellent moisture prevention,"I've owned this unit for two years now. No issues whatsoever. I've plugged it in to ""dry out"" many many times. I use this one in my stored tent-trailer to prevent mold and to suck up any ambient moisture that could harm the inside of the trailer during storage. It works!!!"
4,So far so good,"It works ok, have only used for a month so not had a chance to recharge yet. Will review again after one recharge!!"
3,Not too bad,"I ordered this product for the closet in my bedroom. The closet shares a wall with the outside and with the shower so it becomes humid in there. Also, I live in Miami, FL which is very humid. The product is very convenient to use and it's small size works well in the closet, especially with the little hook it comes with. I just hang it up and forget about it. I have felt the closet less humid but I don't feel it has completely resolved the problem. I don't know whether it is because the product is too small for the closet or what. I do like the product because it has made a difference but it just has not eliminated the problem. I am glad I purchased it though."
5,"So far, so good","So far, the Evs-dry EDV-500 works as advertised. It seems to be an inexpensive, space-saving solution for a small, perpetually humid bathroom. It took about a month to turn pink, & was easy to ""recycle""."
1,Sucks,"The dehumidifier does not work as they say, does not include the amount of moisture that says that you should pick up. The charge says that should last about a month, and it is not.I prefer ones that are electric, work best."
2,I saw no difference in over 2 weeks of use,"I have been using this in a small basement bathroom for about 3 weeks. I can tell no difference at all in the way the bathroom feels. It still feels a bit damp as before I began using the eva-dry. I was very excited to find something that would hopefully work, but was quite disappointed. There were really no instructions other than to renew it when the panel turns pink. Just curious if there is anything that should be done before use, other than just setting it out......"
1,eva dry edv 500,"I dont think this will ever work, this is the second one i got and it doesnt work, i put in my closet that has the EDV 1100 that i also purchased and it still doesnt collect moisture while the EDV 1100 is collecting a lot. I dont recommend this product at all as a matter of fact I am returning it for another EDV 1100 NOW THATS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT THE EDV 500."
3,O.K. but not GREAT,"I purchased 2 of these to put in a large safe. They need to be recharged more frequently than I would like for being in a climate controlled safe. They are heavy and will not hang from the wall outlet to recharge, so I have to use an extension and lay them on their side to ""Recharge"" them. Some of the crystals that can be seen through the window appear to be burnt, and so it is difficult to tell if it is working as advertised. I prefer ""Damp-Rid"" for dehumidifying because you can actually see when it needs to be replaced, as well as gauge how much humidity is in the area. Otherwise it is a great idea, but would have liked better execution."
4,does the job,This unit is effective for small spaces. I use it in cabinets and can see the difference. It is easy to use.
3,"Fun CD, Old Recordings","The songs on this CD are all really fun, but keep in mind that these tunes were all recorded a very long time ago. The recordong quality and sound clarity suffer from being taped on older technology. Most of these tunes have been redone by modern groups on better recording equipment so if you don't care for that old time sound, look elsewhere for these songs."
3,Not a bad cd but not quite Fozzy either...,"Overall, I think this is a solid cd. I particularly like 'Enemy' and 'All That Remains.' 'Wanderlust' has a cool Zach Wylde guitar solo on it. I think this is a good, solid record with lot's of heavy riffage.What I didn't care for was the ""rap"" song, 'It's A Lie' as well as Jericho's attempt at being a thrash/death metal singer on, 'Born of Anger.' I hate it when bands throw on a token track that tries to imitate a genre that they don't even belong to. STICK TO YOUR KIND OF MUSIC!!!I would have preferred to hear a bit more 80's gloss (ala Iron Maiden) on the record but I am happy with it nonetheless. They did a good job of mixing this record. If tracks 6 and 10 could be replaced with songs more closely resembling Fozzy music, I'd would give this a 4 or 5 star rating."
3,A Little Old,"It probably is very difficult to find a comprehensive map on Arkansas and for backroads, this is probably ok. However, be aware that this book is 13 years old and doesn't even have the airport for Northwest Arkansas on it!!We are moving to NW Arkansas and found it difficult to use to get around during our recent tour due to age of map and growth in that area."
2,Kindle Edition,"This does not have an active table of contents and it is very difficult to navigate without one. I just bookmarked each chapter for an easier way to get to the individual Caesars'. But this takes a bit of time. Overall, the content of the book is very good. Again, just difficult to navigate."
4,The Twelve Caesars,I did not have the time to read the book fully but what I have read sheads light upon the first 12 emperors buy someone who was actually around to know these men.
5,Must have for every personal library,"As such i cannot classify myself as a book critic. I basically rate the book more so on its overall impact and the Twelve Caesars by Suetonius takes a great 9 on 10. To me a good personal library would not be complete without books like the Illiad, Odessey etc. This book falls into that category (must have types!). The importance of it is that Seutonius had access to archives that are long lost and that he writes in a very unbiased and objective manner. Very few historians of antiquity have managed to do that. I have read of tyrants like Caligula and read only negative material. This author however even tends to put his good points forward.Overall an excellent find."
5,A great tool for everyday life,With all of my heart and soul I recommend this book to anyone who needs love and peace within. It is a great tool for everyday life--it is easy to read and easy to practice.My favorite exercise in the book is the one with a bucket of muddy water--I can relate to this one. This exercise truly helps me to clean my mind.This book is very helpful in developing a healthy mind--to reduce stress and to help you become more aware of your surroundings.
5,The best book for charts,"I never created charts and with the help of this book, I can create charts effortlessly. Once again, author Bluttman has made difficult computer concepts easy for everyone, including someone like me, who actually has a phobia when it comes to complicated computer applications. I plan to purchase all of the books by Author Bluttman, because he is a gifted, clear and helpful writer.I highly recommend this book."
2,the worse movie ever,this is the worse terriable movie that i ever seen . I don;t recommened anyone to buy this movie this isn't worth anything to buy it to be honest about it.
4,Awsome,"The only problem I have with the film is that they don't show the actual ""killing"" of the girls, their off camera, but it is a powerful film. I know many girls that stay with their abusive boyfriends and let their man do whatever he likes, simply because they love him and this film shows those girls exactly what can happen if you dont stop him. Based on true story makes this film that much more intense and enjoyable. Not to mention Laura Prepon is gorgeous in this film."
1,SUCKS,I was dupped.. I thought this was THE FILM CREW with Mike Nelson and MST3K Buddies.. NOT WORTH THE MONEY... I want to Burn it.AMAZON you sent me this as a pre order suggestion and I am so pissed. Because this is not what I wanted to get! THANKS FOR NOTHING
2,Tuttle Concise Indonesian Dictionary,"It is a ""good"" Concise Dictionary for a starter. There is another one ""Oxford Study Indonesian Dictionary"" by Oxford University Press that I like little more."
5,Indonesian Dictionary,"This a very helpful compact dictionary. Fits well in my purse or my computer case. A little bit big for a pocket if you wanted to carry it around when traveling. You will need some type of bag to put your dictionary in. I am just starting to study Indonesian, so I can talk to my cousins I found on Facebook. This dictionary has come in handy. Easy to read and has a little history about the language and other references like colors, time , numbers, letters and vowel sounds. It starts from Indonesian - English then English -Indonesian. Oh yes, the type face is not too small so it is easy on the eyes."
3,Too concise,"This dictionary would serve the beginner well, but using it to read short stories written by Indonesian writers like Pramoedya Ananta Toer, I found that it was simply insufficient. I like the sturdiness of the binding and the quality of the print. Also, a sterling effort was made to ensure that the definitions were crisp and to the point. But the lack of a decent vocabulary means that you cannot rely wholly on it. To improve the dictionary's functionality, I would recommend expanding the number of entries in future editions."
3,Definitely not show-and-tell,"This book spends most of its time providing definitions of words and terms and little of its time providing demonstrations of concepts. What tutorials and exercises there are do NOT always work as seamlessly as the author would seem to suggest. In fact, some instructions don't work at all -- leaving the reader to figure out the inner workings of an application by trial and error. If you'd like to have a book that TELLS you what everything means but doesn't SHOW or tell you how to accomplish it, this is the one for you."
5,hurray,its wonderful to share with others the wonderful art that exist in Latin America with the rest of the world.
3,Another Pearl of info,"Overall I recomend this book. I like Pavel's stuff.However I would say that the one bad thing about this book is that if youwrote it in normal size type, and did not have huge pictures on every page, it would be a pamplet, not a book! Once again I am a fan of Pavel and I have made huge gains in working out from his material however it is like digging for pearls in oysters.I have Enter the Kettlebell, Bullet Proof Abs, and The Naked Warrior and I think all these could be made into one book. That being said I plan of buying more of his stuff."
5,"Good, like all Pavel's books","This is the book fo those who are after function, not appearance. So if you want a six-pack, you should probably look elsewhere. However, if you are bored of crunches but want really strong torso (I refuse to say core!) and looking for efficient ways to develop it - this is the one. There are enough exercises to choose from and rotate between, and they are efficient and well explained."
4,Bullet Prood Abs,"Good exercises. The first chapter is a sales pitch for his product. Once again, drop the ""Evil Soviet"" stuff and just be yourself. Pavel is a very informative writer and the knowledge alone is enough. I personally don't need the ""former soviet"" act. Last ten pages or so are just advertising."
5,"Love the tv series, love the books","Having come from Helen Mirren, I was not sure how the books would be, but I enjoy them very much."
4,A great pleasure for little ones.,"I ordered two sets for my 2 grandsons, ages 2 and 3. They love superheroes and thewy love these characters."
3,Less Inspiration Found in this Book,"As a huge fan of Donna Hay, I personally found less inspiration in this edition. It might not be that way for you as personal preferences and local availability for certain ingredients came into play."
4,Taking Responsibility,"Here's a rags-to-riches story of a man who got caught up in all the trapping of fame and fortune. Yet, with all the mistakes he made, George Foreman took responsibility. He financially and spiriturally took care of his kids who could have become victims had it not been for a truly strong man. George Foreman is a real hero, not only as a boxer, but as a person."
5,Kip Pacal's Book is Great!,"Kip Pascal has produced an outstanding book, ""Wrist Locks: From Protecting Yourself to Becoming an Expert!"" This book will answer more questions about wrist locks, then you even knew existed, and more then that, it will lead you to ask even further questions in your quest to become an expert in appling this fastastic segment of the martial arts!I was very impressed with Mr. Pascal's 'way' of writing, and you will love his sense of humor, and of course the clear, and presise drawings help even the beginner get a quick grasp on the finer points of appling the locks.The book has become one of the most important books in my martial arts library, and I continue to use it as a reference. I highly encourage you to order this book, you owe to yourself!BIG Sean Madigan"
1,"Flawed, Dated and Useless","This book and it's title is totally misleading as it is a beginner's only book.This is not for experts as the content is rudimentary and focuses on simple basics that one would pick up in a few classes. I was disappointed with the quality of the images as for $35.00 the author could have at least offerred better visuals instructions.Overall, I would give this book one star as the price to value was way out of line!Randall Fahey - Shotokan Karate Alliance"
2,a Chomskyist interpretation of Yugoslavia,"This is a relatively short overview of Yugoslavia from 1918 to its final demise in 2003. The first half of the book covers the creation of Yugoslavia, its WW2 break-up and its re-creation as a socialist federation under Marshall Tito. The chapters are brief and straightforward with little new information.The second half of the book tends to stray into the realm of suspicion and paranoia that is a staple for this part of the world. Hudson unfortunately sees everything that happened in Yugoslavia since 1980 as a consequence of American capitalist imperialism.By the end, I was really tired of this book, even tho it is less than 200 pages. If you want a more objective look at why Yugoslavia so tragically shattered into pieces, look elsewhere. If you want proof that Uncle Sam is manipulating the entire world out of sheer geopolitical aggression, here is your champion."
1,"you forgot to mention that ""ON THE ROAD"" DVD is in PAL format not NTSC","I COULDN'T REVIEW THE DVD BECAUSE IT IS IN PAL FORMAT AND NOT PER YOUR SITE NTSC. IF YOU WANT TO AVOID GETING CRITICISM, MAKE SURE YOU AVERTISE WHAT FORMAT THE DVD IS IN. NOW, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A PLACE THAT SELLS A PRODUCT WHICH PLAYS DVD'S IN BOTH NTSC AS WELL AS PAL FORMAT. JUST THOUGHT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE WHAT IT STATES ON YOUR SITE AS FAR AS WHAT FORMAT THE DVD IS IN."
1,It's a lie!,"According to Osborn, God does not want anyone to be sick. All one has to do is to ask God for healing, and God will heal the sick person. He does not believe what he writes. If he did, he would not have included an out when what he presents does not work. His out is that if the person is not healed, the sick person and the prayer do not have enough faith. Like all who use this out for unanswered prayer, he does not define how much faith is enough faith. Presumably, if the prayer and sick are atheists, who deny God's existence, and the prayer offers up a philippic, sarcastic prayer, and the sick person is healed, then they had enough faith. However, if the prayer and sick are devout Christians whose virtue and piety are beyond question and who have never doubted God and the sick is not healed, then they did not have enough faith."
5,"Excellent, a must have for anyone!",Excellent! If you are looking for answers to your questions about healing. This is the one. Get it. May the LORD bless you and all the others that you pray for!
3,"OK, depending on what you're looking for","As a Domino admin running R6 for several months (and R5 for several years), I was hoping for more detailed server info than this book has. I think if you are a Notes power user or just getting into Lotus programming, this may be a good reference. It is not really an administration reference. I will not be using this book, but plan to make it available to my users. I will be waiting for Kirkland's next book to be released."
4,The Elder Within,"In his book ""The Elder Within"", Terry Jones brings the insights of a wide range of mythologists, psychologists and other experts to bear on the meaning of mature masculinity in the 21st century. His passion to explore his own ""eldership"" fuels his re-visioning of the traditional male roles of protector, provider and teacher. Offering simple, practical ways of becoming an elder in the family and community, Jones pictures the elder as generative, accessible, a listener, a steward of the planet, one who blesses, who makes himself available in quiet, attentive ways to being a resource. Jones's approach is gentle, invitational, inclusive, embodying his own idea of eldership. Readers will find comfort, encouragement and fresh ideas about their own process of embracing the elder within and living their own wisdom to the benefit of others. The book will be useful for group study as well as personal reflection."
2,Too much big game stuff.,"The book is great if you're a deer hunter, but for rabbits and small game it is sadly inadaquate.The photos and explanations are complete and clear... just not for what I hunt."
4,love it,"Really enjoyed the book, my daughter loves it and although she is still under a year she points to the pictures as I say what each one is. I especially like the english spelling of how to pronounce the words in arabic. My mother, who speaks no arabic can even read her the book in her texan accented arabic...very funny, and enjoyable for all!"
4,Great product,8 year old Son got one for christmas 2009. He loves it and it keeps him busy. I ordered 9 of these for a Cub scout project from A1 books and they are the worst. never shipped and i had to contact them to see why they didnt ship.
5,I want to make LOVE to this printer.,"No seriously. I REALLY want to make LOVE to this printer. Yes, it is $600, but it is the best value I've ever seen. Once you try this, you'll wonder why you ever fought with crappy, crappy, crappy inkjet printers. The print quality is superb. The scan capabilities are great. And everything is lickety-split fast. You're gonna love this."
1,cheaply made,chair covers are ultra thin and will not last under the outdoor elements. I do not recommend them and would never purchase these again.
3,Check dimensions for your needs,"This is exactly as is described. Good hanging storage for the price. Please note the dimensions before buying, however. About a year ago I bought a similar product from a storage solutions store and it was larger. So I expected this to be the same. It was not. This one is smaller in width. A pair of mens hiking boots fit easily in the larger upper compartments, but you can really only use the bottom section for 1 shoe per cubby.I have had this product for over 6 months now and it is holding up well. I've been stuffing shoes in and stretching it and no rips yet."
4,A comprehensive and detailed introduction to Chinese,"A comprehensive and detailed introduction to the tecniques of writing and readinig chinese. Cards are quite complete and easy-to-read.Radicals are listed both as traditional and modern, but the authors lack of being clear in distinguishing how to use the two.A possible improvement could be to propone the ""remaining Characters"" (1020-2000) as well as the basic ones."
4,Great Dictionary for Beginners,"If you live in the US (especially the West Coast) this is good to have because it displays the Traditional Chinese characters that US based Chinese newspapers and signs use. Simplified characters are added in where appropriate. It's also easier to read than ""Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary,"" which I also have, so it's great for beginners."
5,Hidden Gem!,This is an excellent album. I am fan of late sixties/ early seventies music. This album is pop with rock and some psychedelia mixed in. Susan Jacks has an unbelieveable voice. All tracks are A+. No throwaways here. I will probably seek out other Susan Jacks material that is not yet on CD.
3,70's Cancon ruled,"This is exactly the type of Cancon (Canadian Content) that I think about from the 70's that a lot of Americans are probably unaware of. 'Which Way You Goin' Billy' was their first big hit; while I consider most of the others middle of the road tunes with the exception of 'Where Evil Grows' and 'Good Friends'.These are the two songs that our good friends at AMAZON need to put into the real player file because once you give a listen you'll buy it.As far as Susan is concerned, I heard a number of years ago that she is remarried and trying to break into country music in Nashville. I can see the similarities in some of the Poppy Family's tunes but obviously appreciated her more for her work with Terry.Also to be considered is Terry's solo work with 'Seasons in the Sun,Concrete Sea' etc and his obscure work with The Hoods 'Cause We're in Love' ditty.Now if they only had stayed good friends...."
2,Certainly Not All That!!!!,"I read some of the other reviews for this book, and being very interested in the time and the setting, was looking forward to my copy of this book arriving.I really wanted to like this book.In truth, the characters are hollow and there is next to no time put in towards more than a cursory glance at each of them, the storyline flicks between the characters from each side in a jagged, hap-hazard way that ultimately results in confusion over characters and sides of the story.The writing style of the author seems to be more interested in 'showing off' particular details of Ancient Greek and Persian life that he has learnt rather than capturing the subject in an imaginative and creative way.Ultimately I was left with no emotional investment in the story and no desire to read other novels of the same Author, which is sad because I love the setting and the time period.As I said, I really wanted to like this book. Sadly, it fell too far short."
5,Helpful,"I got this book to help my parents who just switched from using a PC to a Mac. They had some difficulty adjusting to the Mac that I found myself becoming their tech support person. Since buying this book for them, the tech support calls has decreased and I even got an email saying, that this book was very helpful for them."
4,Teach Yourself Visually,"As a visual learner, these books are very helpful to me. This is the second one I've bought in the series and I like the approach."
4,The real idiot book,This is a real good idiot book. The visuals are what makes the book. A good reference book for the do it yourselfer computer person
5,Sample the Samples with this CD,"The Samples never got ""huge"", but by golly, with albums like this, they should have. I've always felt that the Samples were victims of bad timing; Grunge ruled the 90's leaving little space for their mellower sounds. There's probably atleast six songs on this record that could've been hits if the musical climate had been different at the time. This is a classic CD and a must own."
2,"cantankerous screed, occasionally funny","Poor George. The world pisses him off and there's nothing he can do about it. Don't get me wrong, there are moments through this book that are particularly insightful and very funny, as he attacks how language insidiously breeds its political and religious agendas; however, there are other very long stretches where George is that obnoxious bore at the end of the bar. The 7 dirty words were a riot the first time thru back 30 years ago. Incantations not with standing, the repititive invocations here are just simply a droning and monotonous inveighing that when it doesn't strike you as unimaginative is then patently and moronically of no effect. I've always admired someone who can roll off a curse with aplomb. George isn't one of them. So, shell out the coins to the NY hustler if you must. Maybe one day he'll have enough to hire an editor."
1,Don't be hypocritical,"Yes, George picks on everyone, and yes, he probably does intend to offend even his fans. It's amazing to me that his fans would put up with it, but that's their prerogative. However, George did single Jesus out because he put Jesus in the book title. So George will definitely be hearing from some irate Christians, and that's their prerogative. What I don't get is the people who claim to be Christians saying that knocking Jesus is OK. Jesus is a gentleman. He doesn't insist that anyone follow him. Neither does he offer an option to ride the fence where He is concerned. You are either for Jesus or you are against Him. If you are among the millions of people who bowed their heads during 911 and prayed to God in Jesus name, then you shouldn't be laughing and making light of a book cover that desecrates ""The Last Supper"". That's called hypocrisy. ""Christians"" who say that there's nothing wrong with George attacking Jesus simply aren't really Christians."
3,3 1/2 stars,I'm a big fan of George Carlin and subscribe to many of his views but I think this time around his book was mostly filler and not a lot of quality stuff. I actually got tired a reading the euphemism chapters but I endured.Yes it does have a few gems interspersed with the filler. Those gems almost made it worth it.Recommend the library copy.
1,Didn't Know How Bad It Could Be,"Would have rated a minus star if it was available. Wow. I thought George Carlin was funny...how wrong I was! This is a waste of paper, waste of ink, waste of money and waste of time if you read it. I was up for some laughs -- this is only sophamoric little-boy stuff of saying ""bad"" words,""dirty"" words, body parts, etc, etc. Feels like 8th grade again. Nobody should earn money for this stupidity."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I am neither a member of the right wing nor a religious fanatic, but I found this book to be disgusting and vulgar for no reason. Mr. Carlin could have been just as humerous, without being offensive. Not only was his excessive use of profanity unecessary, but some of his humor was offensive, demeaning and and his stories actually sickening. I would not have even given this book one star if I had a choice. Do not waste your money. This was the first book I actually thought of burning."
1,Horrible,"There's no need to get into a christian/jesus discussion - this book is terrible regardless of your beliefs.Personally, I really enjoy George's TV shows. Unfortunately, this book is without structure and just appears to be a random brain dump of whatever he was thinking while trying to fulfill some commitments to a publisher. Every once in a while he'll write something funny, but most of it is a waste of ink.If you like George, buy something else that he's done. If you're bothered by the title, don't buy the book."
1,"Not Funny, Not Witty, Immature","I've always thought Carlin was witty and smart, even though I could do without the foul language. This work struck me as really immature and not at all witty. The foul language was just offensive and not the least bit funny or additive to his point(s). In fact, I didn't find any of the material funny at all. It was a complete waste of time and money."
3,Ehh,"Not George's best work, by far. WWJBTPC is best when he focuses on people and on himself. His rants on euphemisms, while interesting and illuminating to read, are not what I was looking for when I bought the book. I was looking for something that was laugh-out-loud funny, and all I got were, for the most part, the transcripted versions of three skits he performed on an HBO special back in 1991 (which is still funny, but a profound disappointment), with other material surrounding it.Seriously, guys, wait for the paperback."
3,Not My Favorite Carlin,"This was Carlin's third book and while it is terribly funny, this was also biting. I winced in several spots instead of laughing. Carlin is clearly not a fan of organized religion so if you're the least bit religious, you might just get offended. Of course, if you're reading Carlin, that's probably just an expectation!My favorite sections are always his euphemisms and he doesn't fail to deliver here. This book, though, had a different tone. The focus was less on being funny and more on observing our demented American lifestyle. It wasn't like some of Carlin's other books that felt like a running comedy routine that you could just pick up and and devour in one sitting. This one is more like a sharp cheese that you have to nibble on a little at a time.Still, if you're a Carlin fan, you'll like this one."
3,"Not the best, but not too bad.","I've read all three Carlin books many times and I'd have to say ""When will Jesus Bring the Porkchops"" is probably my least favorite. Most of the book is full of his view on euphemisms which, while funny, can become stale pretty quickly. I finished the book in two days and found the latter part of the book seemed funnier than the first half. Still though, there are some Carlin bits I wish had made it in that weren't in either of his other books. Overall the book is sufficient for the general Carlin fan, but probably want satisfy a run of the mill fan.And about all this talk of religion, why? God has a sense of humor too... I'm not sure why religious folks would get so up in arms over a simple book. Carlin has the right to sell this book in stores just like Joyce Meyers has her right to write about Jesus. If we were to go and ban Carlin's book then it would only be fair to ban any book about religion. But we don't, that's what's good about America."
2,This is an objective review of the content,"I've read all three of Carlin's books, and this is by far the worst. It really feels like Carlin was scraping the bottom of the barrel for material. It's very observational, but not very funny. Most of the book (I stopped at about page 95) is his word-play, which can be clever at times when it's interspersed with other funny material. But page after page of word-play and rants about euphimisms gets old. If you want funny Carlin material, read Brain Droppings, which had me laughing so hard I cried several times. Sorry, George, but this book is not funny."
2,"What Happened to the ""Foole""?","I used to love George Carlin. I thought he was the funniest thing this side of hell and damnation. But in recent years (I trace it back to the first heart attack, myself) his humor muse seems to have deserted him. Most of this stuff does not even remotely compare to the early Carlin stand-up albums. And I am not a right-wing wacko who is offended by the anti-Christian stance that Carlin seems to make a staple of his comedy these days. I just don't think very much of it is very funny. Some of the pieces here, to be sure, sent me into spasms of hysterics, but these were few and far between. My reccommendation? Get Carlin's Little David Years box set which has the classic ""Occupation: Foole"" (as referenced in my title) as well as six others including the Grammy Award winning ""FM & AM""."
1,Where's the Humor????,"Blistering, malicious, and not all that funny--this book goes from bad to worse in a New York minute. I half expected George to blast my Grandma, or even his Grandma for that matter! I understand sattire, but it doesn't need to be this vicious. George should try some Ritalin before he writes his next book."
1,I just dont get it....,This book was plain offensive...he should not write about a mans religion. The book was filled with immature jokes.
4,"Beautiful color, under the right conditions","This is one of my first neutral (I won't call it ""nude,"" because, well, not everyone has pink skin) nail polishes, and it does not disappoint. Overall, the shade is beautiful and easy to wear. Under certain lighting, it can appear on the brown side, while other times it appears more pink. It depends on your skin tone, as well."
5,Fun Sci-Fi that doesn't take itselt too seriously.,"Book two in Sten series and I am craving more. The first book set up our main character and trained him. Wolf Worlds lets him do his thing. The authors create a really interesting challenge for Sten as he gets to defuse a conflict between some sects of a religious group. These folks just happen to live right in the way of a new mineral that the Empire needs.So, Sten gets to go without use the tools that his Mantis Section training has given him. Instead he has to be a bit creative to keep the mission moving in the right way, but without all of the support he might have grown used to.I like the story, but I really like Sten. He remains a somewhat conflicted hero who isn't comfortable with every decision he has to make nor is he guaranteed to succeed at everything he tries. Things work out, but there are bumps in the road that threaten the mission. It's good stuff and worth buying from someone used."
3,An Average Book,"I found this book average at best.As has been previously stated, large chunks of the book are punctuated by military communications of varying technical content. This breaks the continuity of the story and after a very short while, I, personally, found it tedious and skipped pages to rejoin the narrative. Leninger also appears to have a problem with authority which manifests itself in a number of ways and only served to gradualy erode any empathy I may have felt for him.There are many, many great books regarding the Vietnam War available, this, unfortunately, isn't one of them."
5,What an AMAZING resource book for ANY Teacher!,"I am an elementary Art teacher, and was introduced to this book by a friend. I have found it to be one of the greatest resource books I gave ever used! The author's approach makes the projects in the book something ANY child, regardless of art talent, or any other restrictions, can be a full and enthusiastic participant in. It opens dialogue, even for the most shy students, and presents students with a way to find themselves in often the most difficult and confusing times in their growing up. I could see this book as being beneficial for adults as well, the lessons have such core value messages, I dont think there is anyone out there who couldnt benefit from this book!!!"
3,Great Material but Weird Design,"This set is made of a very comfortable and attractive material-beautiful color- and shipping was swift. Price is excellents. However, I do not like the straps on the dress-- simply said, they are just weird. I'm like, ""Does my arm go in this whole, or this hole...."" Very weird. Also the size chart said that I should buy a small but when I got it, it was too small. Though I can still wear it with a robe over it, it looks weird without the robe--- so tight in the chest and too short. I am not a big woman: 5'4,120 pounds, and wear a 34B bust size so I cant see why it shouldnt have fit. But yes, I would still buy again, just a size up."
5,mmm mmmm goodand sexy,"Delightful to the eye and the skin. Sexy baby doll in a rich color (that's not black or red) and fabric . . . and at a reasonable price, too. Temptation abounds with this item, so tempt your partner by wearing thiis. Light candles and pour the champagne for a good time."
2,product did not meet expectations,"the nightgown was odd, so odd wasnt even sure how to put it on, however i did like the robe so i kept that and threw away the nightgown, th e shipping was good"
1,Looks good but Not the best quaility,THis looks great but i was really disapointed in the general quality.and the roughness of the cloth...it seems that this is more ofa costume than an actual item you would wear daily...kinda like fredricks of hollywood quality vs victoria's Secret quality.
2,ripped,when I opened the packaging there was a rip down the side of the night gown. the robe was fine but still disappointing.
1,Eeeh.,"The material is really unpleasant and somewhat stiff, and hangs awkwardly. Also the shape is very awkward. AND the straps of the thing are difficult to handle and create unflattering lines. And you can't really sleep in it (which I know isn't the intended purpose, but, you know..) because the straps sort of pull at your back and arms. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Nice,"It was very nice for the price! I do agree that the nighty was very odd, it took me about 15 minutes to figure out how to put it on, once I did, it was cute! Try to find a photo of the back, it will help. Also, you may want to order a size larger, I wear a M and ordered a L and it fits nicely. The material was not top quality but fine for me as I only paid $20 for it. All in all very nice product for the price!"
2,Made in China...,It is sized at least 2 sizes too small and the material is thin. Definitely for show not for sleeping.
4,Comfy!,This is a great little outfit! It has comfy adjustable straps and you can use the two bows to make it fit your body and look Great!
2,great history but not very...good,i found this book to be slow in the beginning and early middle. while i enjoyed the history it was not one of my favorite books.
5,Very fast and cheap. Power hungry.,"As the title reads, it's very fast and cheap, but power hungry. No heat issues. Remember to have a good power supply unit (at least 500W), specially if you have to feed many internal devices."
5,Working With Hp a1730n,"I just successfully added this card, an Athlon X2 6000 (Model ADX6000CZBOX), which has 2 mg. of L2 Cache, to my HP a1730n, with the HP upgraded Bio, ver. 5.07. The CPU was properly recognized by the Bios. Temp. of the CPU is in the very low 50's C., and the main board is in the low 40's C. The out-of-the-box fan seems adequate and quieter than the original CPU fan for this model. An appreciable increase in speed well worth the $90 spent. You might wish to add an inexpensive replacement case fan to lower noise and perhaps increase flow."
3,CAN'T INSTALL,"My computer is Lenovo 3000 J115 bought in Nov 06. When trying to change out the processor (no problem) and then the heatsink, I find the fancy dual stage heatsink does not fit. The copper tubes do not allow the bottom heatsink to seat down against the top of the processor. Looks like i will have to replace the heatsink retaining frame. It is held down by 4 screws. Are they self tappers or do i have to get to the back of the mobo. Is there a new frame that will solve my problem? Where can I get it? Any part numbers?[...] Thanks"
3,Fun,"I chose this rating because there are things I like and dislike about this title. I really like the anime style and the way you basically watch what is happening between the characters almost as if you were watching anime rather than playing a game, though there is fighting in it. I did not like the switch for fighting. It was a weird 2d side-scroll view and the character sprites looked clunky. Also there is some language in it, if that is an issue for you. I recommend this to jrpg fans who can see the beauty in spite of it's faults."
3,Hello Publishers - are you out there?,"Okay, so how can Christopher Radko do anything wrong?? Well, he probably can't - but his publishers sure can. You may ask, what good is a picture full of detail that is only 2"" by 1.5""?? PUHLEASE make those pictures bigger - the magnifying glass works, but not as well as a bigger picture.And the text....goes on....and on....and on.....with very humdrum items. How to pick a Christmas tree, how to light it. This information has been included in every Christmas book through the ages. We don't need to have it over and over again. Take away some of those words and put in more OR JUST BIGGER PICTURES!!This guy is special - make him a special book!!"
3,Christopher Radkos Heart of Christmas,"This book has some great decorating ideas, but no technique on how to create these items yourself. This is why ... is so popluar. She not only shows you, she tells you how!"
4,One of the Best,"Loved it! Very good plot throughout the whole series! Illustrations are excellent! Overall my favorite series of all time. Sailor Moon is my favorite. I'm a big reader and have read many fantastic books, but this series remains the top of my list!"
2,"Beautiful art, but...","I thought that the artwork was beautiful, and that was the reason I gave it 2 stars. But after reading it once, I didn't want to again, and that is how I judge if a book is good or not. I was disappointed in the plot, finding it slightly superficial. If you like the Sailor Moon series or books, I suggest getting them from the library. They are way too much money to read just once."
4,Uplifting,"There were parts of this book, that almost had me in tears. Most of the other reviewers have covered what I wanted to say about this book.I was torn between giving it four or five stars. I liked the book. I liked it a lot, but my definition of love, is a book I can't put down, and while there were moments in this book, that I felt I couldn't put it down, there were other times when I had to put it down, simply because I could relate to Tanya (so perhaps that is a reason it should be 5 stars).The characters felt 3 dimensional, and there were times, when I felt like I wanted to move into the ranch, simply to spend time with the housekeeper (her name escapes me as I write this)."
2,disppointed,"i am a big fan of chayanne, this is an older cd and if you like mexican hat dancing you will like this cd, for me it was disappointing, but everyone has different tastes."
1,A Piece of Drek! Don't Even Bother.,"Great size, total lack of quality. Recording time is about 2 seconds, not the 8 that is promised, and the quality is unintelligible, anyway. Don't waste your time and money."
4,"Sweet Movie, well worth watching","I usually don't care for Farah Fawcett in movies, but this was a sweet movie I really enjoyed. Well worth the money and time to watch it. Highly Recommend."
5,For Samples fans and newbies alike,"For the quinticential Samples fan to a newbie, this collection is great. The Samples are best when they are both live and kept separated from the big label producers that mellow their sound. This is a must have CD(s)"
4,Great learning fun!,"My children are fascinated with Ancient Egypt and were engrossed with the fun and educational projects in this book. We had a great time making the recipes, learning heiroglyph meanings, playing the games and learning all about life in Ancient Egypt.I highly recommend this for some educational interactive family fun!"
3,a lil bummed,I had seen this watch at Macy's and was stoked to find it on amazon...but when I recieved it the watch was bigger. When I went back to the Macy's to puchase the first one I saw they had sold it already and also only had the large face version :( It still is a very beautiful watch
5,Excellent introduction to Yoga,"I have several books on Yoga, but this is the one I like to use. It is easy to look at while practicing due to it's unique binding. Also, the beginners routine is the best mix of postures for beginners that I have found. It's not too easy, but it isn't too hard. You are eased into yoga practice. At the end of a workout, I feel energized and relaxed. I can't wait until I am ready to try the intermediate workout. The relaxed feeling stays with me throughout the day. That's nice. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
3,a deeper bow,"In the past I've very much enjoyed Scott Watson's translations/versions of Santoka's work and do so here. There is no question about the result of Watson's labors. I do find though that parts of his introduction display an off putting attitude. If one were to skip over the intro, the book would be as pleasant as it was in its previous incarnations."
5,Hanging Shoe Rack,"Arrived on time, Works as advertised, Velcros onto the hanger rod for easy install. Have trouble fitting larger shoes/high tops, tho."
3,Ateco fondant mat (ink bleeds),"I was so excited to get in my work mats and washed them in hot, soapy water before use, as instructed... but found that even after washing, the ink from the blue guide lines come off on the fondant. Wish I knew what to do to make the excess ink totally come off these mats as they are a great work surface for fondant and gumpaste,etc. but I find myself only working in the small area that does not have the blue ruler marks. UGH!"
1,Don't buy from these people!,"I never rececieved the second package, only one, 10.5 oz pkg. Neither the seller or Amazon ever responded to my complaint that I only received one. I've waited nearly 6 weeks before writing this review in order to give them ample time to take care of the problem. I'll think twice about amazon in the future too. THis isn't the first time they've ignored my complaint."
4,Made a great present,"Bought this for my boyfriend's mother for Christmas as she is an avid birder. We were worried that she might already have this collection, but it was new to her and she loved it!"
3,All the good songs are FREE at MP3.com,"*Originally released in 1998*Most of the goods songs can be downloaded for free at MP3.com*Some songs are unlistenable - bad!*Lead singer Bob Guiney is the next ""Bachelor"" on ABC TV this Fall (2002)."
3,"Nice desk, but...","This is a pretty nice desk, but the cable management thing arrived shattered on one side and there are a few pretty bad nicks on the desk surface. They aren't that bad and it wouldn't be worth not having a desk, so I decided not to return it."
5,Women's History,"This is a wonderful resource book and frighteningly descriptive book on our female ancestors. I actually purchased this to replace my original copy which had been lost during a move. It goes back to very early history and how women were revered and considered strong and virtuous, to the decline and low value women attained in even our own current history. There is a sequel to this which touches more on the late 1800's to current time. I am ever amazed at the strength and spirit of women. Women have endured many unfair practices and have been the target of abuses of every kind from the earliest of times. The book illustrates not only the low notes, but the ways women have come back to secure themselves using the law and other means. A highly recommended book if one wishes to understand more about womenkind."
1,Cheaply Made,"Instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro. This puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight. Great for holding air, not great for holding items."
5,Super Product,"As a person with a small closet I needed something that I could use to put extra clothes in, and this product works perfectly. I love how its so simple to set up and take down when needed. Its sturdy and works great for storing my extra socks and winter tops. I definately reccommend this product. And so affordable too."
3,Does not fit,"This product claims it can fit an '01 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, but it doesn't. When I compared the length of this belt to the one I took out it was about 2-3 inches smaller. The belt itself seemed to be of good quality but not the right size for my truck."
5,The long journey back to innocence. A Survivor's tribute.,"In ""Rising"" Darnella ford masterfully weaves enthralling prose, tumultuous story, and dark psychology into a most tangible piece of artwork. The 3-dimensional aspect of her tale allows the reader to not only ""be"" in the moment with the leading character, Symone, but also permits the reader to ""feel"" their way through the journey of survival alongside her as well. The more gentle reader may find this re-hashing effect to be too shocking, but victims of abuse (as well as readers who wish to learn more about the experiences of childhood trauma)will certainly find a safe haven to explore their pasts and continue the path towards healing. Although the story is entertaining in its vivid imagery, skillful detail, and sincere meaning, let us not forget the focus of the piece. It is an acknowledgement and tribute to the ""survivor"". An embracing of the resilient child within us all. A most memorable and engaging read."
5,Woodswoman,"I have read several of Anne Labastille's books and this, being her first to write, is my favorite. It covers her love for the beautiful outdoors, acquiring land and building her log cabin in the remote Adirondacks. It also covers her discovery of the area, people she encountered, neighbors she grew to love, and getting a wild fox for a pet - and a dog for companionship. She was also able to travel and speak to groups. Pretty full life for her. An added plus for me was that this book was signed by Anne. Neat!"
1,STINKS ON ICE,"Do not look for tips,secrets,cheats,etc. on this comic book.If you get stuck in a section of this game,This (book)? will not help. I can see why its Totally Unauthorized.It is not helpfull at all."
2,African American Children was the subject of her book,"I am a college student majoring in education and I was reading this book for a class. I enjoyed reading this book for enjoyment purposes only. Dr. Ladson-Billings talked about her subject indeed. But I have to disagree with her when she talks about teaching African American children in a different way. First of all it would make them think that they (we) are always supposed to be treated in a ""different"" manner and secondly where would this exist? Utopia!! If we stop separating children, then maybe our problems will get solved. But, trying to teach one group this way and another group another way only creates problems for students as well as teachers. Furthermore, where will we find this PERFECT teacher? We are becoming a melting pot and therefore strategies for teaching one set of people one way will soon become obsolete."
2,Linguistics,"I read this book for an education class, *after* I had already done extensive linguistic study. From a linguistic standpoint, Shirley Brice Heath's book ""Ways With Words"" is much more effective. Ladson-Billings glosses over the differences between African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Standard American English (SAE). There are vital distinctions between these that are important for any teacher of either dialect to understand! Heath's book is much more comphrehensive regarding both AAVE and SAE and even teaching in a classroom where both are spoken. I heartily recommend Heath; you can take or leave Ladson-Billings and I prefer to leave it."
5,A great reading for surveillance operatives!,"Serious Surveillance for the Private Investigator is a great book for anyone who is serious about surveillance. This book teaches you everything you need to know how to conduct a successful surveillance. Even If you are an experienced surveillance operative, after reading this book you may change the the way you do surveillance ."
1,Very Disappointing,"I looked forward to being able to play some Christmas music on the guitar. I expected to get the guitar chords with these songs. There are 4 pages with 120 chords at the back of the book, but no chords with the songs themselves, which all seem to require chords that are not in this book. The publisher recommends another of their publicataions ""for a more complete guide to chords.""The size of the print on these small pages is also very difficult to work with."
4,the yarn harlot strikes again!,"this book is a little more technical than Steph's first two, but a must-have for any fan of her humorous celebrations of the Knitterly Lifestyle. she includes invaluable size charts, tips, tricks, and ""recipes"" that make are incredibly handy and make for a well-rounded set of ""tools"" every knitter should know. she writes in a friendly, humorous, and accessable tone that i have come to love. the only reason i give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that, like i said, it's a bit more technical, and i prefered the personal stories and scenarios from the first books. however, if you're a Knitter-with-a-capital-K, you'll love this book!"
4,A book that leaves you with options...,"This book by Eric Carle is a simple book that I believe could be used many different ways. You could use this book in weather themes, during a cloud unit, or to stretch the imagination.You could follow this book with an activity in which your children do their own cloud making, possibly out of cotton balls.I think that this book is fun and I really enjoy the illustrations. I would definitely suggest having this book as a part of your classroom library."
3,chelsi,timely reciept. great likeness as pictured online. Not as stiff as I would like. A little matted and will have to un tangle gently.
2,paint scratcher. Beware,"this pad came with my porter cable DA polisher. I tried it out with some hi-end wax on the roof of my car. Initally I thought it was doing just fine, but after wiping off the wax, I found circular scratch marks that definetly were not there previously. the Car had just been washed and was dry. I did not use extensive pressure, just let the polisher do the work for me and I used enough wax, too. It's a 2001 Porsche 911 (which is supposed to have ""Hard"" paint in the first place)Have ordered Lake County softest pads and will try out in a inconspicuous area before letting loose on the body of my baby.You've been warned!"
2,Falls apart during first use,Fell apart first use. Not recommended. The 7424 is awesome. Pad is terrible.
1,What a waste of time!,"A relative of mine suggested this book to me since I'm an avid fly fisherman. It looked interesting, but little did I know what I was in for. I didn't know anyone could get published for writing such absolute garbage. How can an author butcher so many cliches and stereotypes in so few pages? The sorry attempts at steamy romance (ala Harlequin) were enough to gag me. It's painfully obvious that the author is trying to live out his fantasies through his characters. Grammatical errors throughout the book made me want to mark it up with red pen and send it back to Mr. Leitz to reprint."
5,Packed with valuable insights,"As a cancer patient, I thought I would derive some beneficial nutrition info from some chapters. What I found was immediately useful information on life-saving dietary/living habits and invaluable sources for high quality dietary supplements. Not only did the book tell what to do, but it thoroughly explained WHY. ...well documented. I keep picking up this book and reading it again..... I would like to thank Dr. Blaylock for this valuable contribution to our society."
5,Health and Nutrition Secrets,This book is laid out in layman terms anyone can follow and understand. An excellent and informative book.
3,Exspensive,"Product is as described, however, you can get them for 1/2 price at Kroger Super Market. Would have just gotten them there had I known."
4,"Like the Sportster, but...","This unit is nearly identical to the Sportster Replay. It works exactly like it, uses the same cradles, etc... I also own a Sportster Replay that I've been using for about 6 months. The Streamer unit I just recieved works fine except that the buttons don't have the same feel. You really have to push them all the way in to get them to work. It's not bad enough to cause me to return the unit but it doesn't fill me with confidence. My advice is that if the price is the same get the Sportster Replay. If you can get a better deal on the Streamer go for it, it's fine.Also, see my Sportster review for more details and in any case GET SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO! I haven't listened to anything else since I got it. Even the television is getting a rest."
2,Siriusly disappointing (beware),"I've bought 2 of these units over the past two years. Both times, the blue display light conked out about 3 months into use. I did not have the unit on more than a few hours a day so it couldn't be burn out. Additionally, the second unit I bought has a horrible FM transmitter in it. It barely transmits in my car (I use an output device that goes into my tape deck for clear reception) and does not allow me to listen to Sirius on other radios in my house like the old one did. I called Sirius about this and they said they had to adjust all the units because the FCC came down on them. But I wasn't told that beforehand! Anyway, you'd probably be better off with another unit for Sirius. As for the programming, I cannot say enough positive thngs about Sirius. It is WELL worth the 13 bucks a month. I never listen to regular radio anymore. And I barely have a need to listen to CDs in my car anymore. In short, buy Sirius but not the Streamer Replay."
5,"Witty, wily, intelligent, and fun!","What a great book, even for someone who isn't a cat lover. I bought this for a friend but after flipping through it, ended up having to buy another so I could keep a copy. Martha Bayless has written what will surely be a classic in the field of kitty lit (not to be confused with kitty litter). I hope this is the first of many more amusing and, yes, practical books like this."
5,WOW!! what a way to go out,"Wow!! What a way to go out. Every question I had when I started this book was answered by the end. What a way to finish the series. It like Ramdom said that for all his powers, he can't find where he belongs in the new Empire."
4,good book and series but.....,"This series was in most parts very good.The stories moved at a fast pace and the fight secnes were great.The dialouge was interesting and funny.The only real gripe I had was the finaly.WARNING!If you have not read this book you may not want to read this next part!I hate when the main character dies at the end expesialy Owen(he exausts his power and gets killed by a gang of morons,on Mistworld.And when Hazel finds out it says she flys of never to be seen again)."
5,Wonderful Story,I am an ardent follower of every one of these books on the life and times of the Deathstalker family. Mister Green's books have held my attention captive from page to page through the end of every book. Thank you so much for all the wonderful reading.
5,"Bravo, Maggie Shayne!!!","This is the first book I have read by Maggie Shayne. The plot is twisitng and turning at every moment. It will keep you guessing until the heart-stopping climax. The main character, Holly, has been traumitized for many years. When a mysterious man strolls into her town, her nightmares come back to haunt her. This mystery is mixed beautifully with suspense and romance. Don't miss this great read!!"
3,Whalesong,This book was ok. It was slow in the beginning. It speeds up towards the end. It is written very nicely with good words. I love the action in the last two chapters. This is a ok book.
3,Whalesong,"This book Whalesong was boring until the end. I didn't like it when something was attacking, but then the whales didn't have a lot of trouble fighting them off. Hruna (the whale telling store) gets into a lot trouble, but never gets really hurt. At the end it was really good and I didn't want to put the book down. That is why I think this book was boring."
2,"Nice at first, then it stops sucking.","This works great until the first time you take the tank off- it seems to just STOP picking up the dirty water no matter how tight the plastic housing with the bladder is seated on the machine. You have to take it apart and hope that it clicks into place just right. Must be built, designed, marketed, and tested by engineers, not actual humans with real world experience. Way too complicated. I just want to clean my carpet, man."
1,Multiple issues/faults,"We have had 3 of the Bissell modles over the years.The first model we had the hose rotted within 18 months and about 4 uses.We tried again when we moved. This second stopped spraying and picking up water. Sent it back to the company and they sent as refurbished model after we fought with them on the phone explaining that the machine was junk and they needed to fix it. Used it once and now that has stopped spraying water too.All in all none of the models have been good. For the money they don't do what they are supposed to.When it works it leaves the carpet wet and does not seem to get the carpets that clean. Even with good vacuming prior, the base clogs every 15mins so lots of trips to the trash, lots of taking apart and rinsing, and it turns something rather simple into a huge long process.Not worth the money. Would recommend paying someone else to come clean your carpets every year or trying a different make."
1,Needs work just after warranty is up.,"Well I liked this machine just after I got it. Except for leaking the cleaning solution when parked, it seemed to be working fine. Then one year later (just out of warranty) I'm using the hand tool to clean my car and the pump stops working. I'm a mechanic so I take it apart to see if it's fixable. A new pump cost me $29.95 plus shipping and about an hour to repair. So now comes the reason that inspired me to write this. My machine worked for almost an hour before the pump motor burned up again. Again I was using the hand tool. It turns out that this little and I mean little motor just overheats when it has to push water and soap all the way to the hand tool. I won't be recommending this machine."
5,Great Cleaner!,"I didn't buy this machine on Amazon, but I am an avid Amazon user and I used the reviews to purchase this cleaner. Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The first carpet we used it on had a brown border that turned tan instantly! I didn't have any problems with leaking as of yet and it is extremely easy to clean. I recently returned another cleaner made by hoover in the same price range that leaked. Also this one is easier when it comes to using the attachment. Simply select the attachment switch and you are in business. The other cleaner had a piece that had to be attached which was a nuisance. Overall I am thrilled with my purchase and like the other reviewers said, it works like the rental cleaners."
2,bissel proheat,I bought this cleaner in January of this year it has quit letting the water and cleaner out the machine is clean and free of dirt do not know why it quit would not buy again only thing that works is the suction....
2,This machine doesn't such up water,"NEGATIVE:This machine does not such up water therefore leaving the carpet much wet.Bad enginnering: Whoever thought of designed a plastic bladder to contain clean water and at the same time place it in the dirty water container, what if the bladder leak, you'll have clean water mixing with dirty water.Small tank therefore one need to empty the tank and change water more often.The double brushes do not clean well.POSITIVE:NoneOverall this machine is going back to the store where it comes from"
1,Heath Zenith Lighting Has Major Problems,"I bought four sensor activated, dual brite lights. One lasted about a month. Took it back to Lowes. Heath Zenith had discontinued the light. None available. Talked to Heath Zenith. They do not repair lights. They do not build lights. They import from offshore and sell to dealers. Warranty is worthless. You can get a refund for a light if you don't mind having lights that don't match. Have looked at number of forums. The Heath Zenith product line is giving a lot of people major problems."
4,hanging shoe bag,This was an item I had a hard time finding in a local store. I was looking for specific dimensions and this was the only place I could find it. Looked exactly how it does on the website.
3,Whitney Design Hanging Shoe Bag,"This is a quality product and an excellent tool for increasing storage space, however it smelled like it had been stored in a barn. I've been spraying fabric refresher for several days on it and it still smells terrible."
4,unique and gifted,"i've owned this cd for years and years. bought a used car that only plays cassettes so i purchased the cassette. julia fordham's vocal range is almost 3 octaves. and she does it with ease. her songs and lyrics are fresh every time i listen, and i've listened a lot. her music speaks about the sensual, romantic, gentle and intellectual in women not just in the lyrics but in the moodiness of the songs with their sometimes wandering melodies and unexpected twists and turns."
3,rubber to plastic,"I have ordered the park smart before. I loved it. I bought another. Now, however on my third order, they are not made from a ""rubber"" like material but made from a hard plastic. This products slips more when you roll on it. It now has stickers to hold the mat in place. Probably a good feature until you may want to move it."
2,Why is price so much higher than what's on cover???,Got this today and the jacket clearly states this book was purchased for $6 from a sale of some sort and is very stained/smelly--we paid $19.50 for it......would assume it 'appreciated' in price therefore the inflated price?
5,Great Shoes,I bought these for my son for Christmas to replace his old ones that looked like a dog had them for a chew toy. Very reasonably price compared to the manufacturer. Very pleased.
4,A Modern Blast From The Past,"Being a teenager during the 80's meant that electro pop was THE music to listen to and this album reminds you what great times they were. Brought up to date by todays DJ's the tracks sound as fresh as when I first bought some of them s 12"" singles. The stand out tracks are. Depeche Mode, New Order, INXS, Yaz and Echo and The Bunnymen. Overall a very enjoyable album."
4,4 1/2- Wonderful fist record!,"Élan took me by surprise. Think of Boards of Canada meet modern jazz. That is the closest reference point I can draw for you. I believe this band is from the Denver CO area. Deluge of Sound tracks is a short (40 minutes or so) CD that covers quite a range of musical styling. The pieces are well and thought out performed. I think that there are not very many people that have heard of this band yet, which is why it is selling rather inexpensively at the time of this writing. Lots of electronics intermixed with standard rhythm section sounds. In keeping with an `NPR' type of collage of textual sounds, Élan Fits right in with my BOC, Autechre, John Scofield and Jim Rydl, music variety of tastes. Wonderful spin!"
1,the worst book ever,"This is without a doubt the worst book I've ever read - actually, I couldn't even read the whole thing, it was so terrible. Allen plays fast and loose with historical facts, casually tossing out flippant remarks and trying to pass himself off as knowledgeable, but he is more of a wise guy and his humor is best-suited to the junior high boys at the back of the schoolbus.Perhaps this book was meant to be understood as tongue-in-cheek; however, it comes across as ignorant. If you want to know the real stories of the histories of different foods, read anything BUT this book!"
1,Gruesome Food Facts,"I have read about 3/4 of this book, and may not finish it. The gory details of cannibalism are interspersed throughout the book, including the description of infants and children being sold and prepared for consumption. While I understand that cannibalism and human sacrifice has been practiced in a number of cultures, it is not something I find humorous or entertaining to read about."
1,"Careful, this is a deceptive pitch","I ordered this based on the image on the Web site. If you are seeing a bottle showing a 40% bonus, and an indication to hurry there is limited supply, you can forget receiving that product. It will be the 8.5 oz. size. This would be okay if they showed the size or indicated anywhere that the image was incorrect. But they don't. I contacted the seller and they said they don't have any control over the image...i.e. caveat emptor. As of this review, the image that no one seems to be able to control, stills shows the oversize bottle.Perhaps a small thing, but that kind of deception gets a one star from me.Still want the product, order it. But now you know."
4,"Solid, introductory selections","This is a short collection of some of Gibson's only short stories and provides a pretty solid glimpse into the cyberpunk genre. The stories themselves often seem a bit incomplete, a little fragmented at times, they were Gibson's early attempts at writing. Some of the other stories such as 'Dogfight' and 'Burning Chrome' are excellent in idea and execution. A good read overall."
4,all wonderful but not all cyberpunk,"While William Gibson IS a gifted writer with his original insights into post-modern technological cultural, these short stories don't all revolve around this theme. Only Johnny Mnemonic, New Rose Hotel, Winter Market and Burning Chrome. These stories are the of the same caliber as Neuromancer and Count Zero (the other two Gibson novels I've read). The other stories were not throwaways, but they were goodies thrown into the bag- all good, some exceptional, prosed with short yet deep stories. This is a definite addition to a Gibson collection, but would I go as far as saying that this is a definite addition to a cyberpunk collection... perhaps."
4,Like a cd,"Like a cd, where there are the tracks you really like and listen to over and over again among others that are just adequate, this book contains a few diamonds in the rough. It's been a while since I read it, so I don't remember the titles of the two stories I liked, but they both got me feeling and thinking hard.One is about a lonely man who discoveres a new species of demi-humans while hanging out in a bar. It's freaky.The other is about a space station whose sole mission is to comfort and welcome back astronauts from their extremely taxing trips through an alternate dimension.These may sound like stupid themes, but Gibson really treats the subject matter well."
3,Defective DVD,I was enjoying this movie until the DVD started breaking up and then froze up completely. I'd like to see the last 45 minutes but I don't know if I should risk buying another DVD. Maybe TCM will eventually run this movie.
2,Not 'Power' ful enough,"As a lifelong fan of Mr. Washington I bought the movie to round out my collection. Didn't like the movie--the concept if PR people (Richard Gere, Gene Hackman) going to such extreme measures--aagh! Denzel's role was very minor. Disappointing movie; glad I didn't pay any money to see it."
1,power,i can't rate it because i received (2)discs from amazon and bth of them jammed on me i would luv to see this movie .Beware if your considering ordering it.
3,"Large numbers okay, but ...","I ordered these for my mother, who has macular degeneration. The size of the numbers is good, but she had a problem distinguishing the aces from the 4's, and couldn't readily make out the jacks because the hook at the bottom of the J is quite short, not a real hook. Also, when holding the cards fanned out, you can't easily see the suits because they're covered by the overlapping cards. I imagine the degree of degeneration plays a part in how good the cards are, but if you have an advanced case it'd probably be wise to look around before buying these."
3,Jumbo Cards,I was expecting Jumbo cards - large size cards. What I got was jumbo letters on regular sized cards.
4,Great playing cards for anyone with vision problems.,"These cards have helped a friend continue to enjoy bridge. They are not as sturdy as Congress playing cards, but they are designed well for anyone who loves to play cards but has macular degeneration."
1,Deceptive Description,Cards are not super jumbo. They are regular sized playing cards. The faces are large. No way these cards list for 60.00!
5,Good reference on the management consulting practice,The most complete and definitive reference work on the management consulting profession. Anyone trying to follow a career on MC should read this book. I still use it to give me ideas to create training materials for junior consultants...
3,A bit loud,I bought this to replace a failed sprinkler pump (motor rusted out completely - pump was probably still good). Really was looking for a more efficient pump but couldn't find one. This one appeared to be the exact same as the old Flotec but the new housing is plastic. Motor looks to be better protected against corrosion anyway. The thing was about 1 inch taller than before so I had to cut the feed pipe and install a splice which was a nuisance.Seems to work OK. Maybe a bit more powerful than the old one but also seems a bit louder. Lowes had one a bit cheaper but last time I bought a pump from them my lawn guy said it was junk and it didn't last a year. This last one (Flotec) lasted about 8 years which is not too bad considering the salt in the air where we live rusts everything.
5,Major Changes,"I started this series when I was 13 and 1/2 and I fell in love with it . Though I will add the 3rd book gets a little confusing . ( It also took me 2 years to find it ) I ended up finding it at the local libariy in Indiana ( I`am from CA.)Anyway the second book is the most importent in this 3 book series . This is where everything changes and true agendas are showen . Well most of them . It shows who Alex truly is. A cold , unremorseful , savage , self centered maniac. Who relishes using the gift for evil. Yet , you also see a different side of Holly. A young women with a gift of evil and fights it to protect the ones she loves. This book is such a dramtic turnig point in the series . It`s a must read and forgive me if I don`t make it sound like a great book . It is , there `s just so much you`ll find it`s hard to put in words."
3,"Cute, but not a favorite","Cute rhyming story, but definately not a classic. Silly and too repetitive. Illustrations were good, but just not my cup of tea."
4,Makes my toddler laugh,"This silly, cute turkey counting book has nice pictures. It is a countdown of 10 silly turkeys each showing off for each other and then falling off the fence they are sitting on. I always like books that rhyme and my 21 month old laughs at every page (I think because each page says something like ""uh oh"" or ""oopsy"" as the turkey falls off the fence) though I'm not entirely sure why and I don't think he gets much of what's going on, he loves the rhyming and the actions I do and the pictures and the exclaimations. I just love hearing him laugh so I read this over and over."
2,Warning to buyers of Kindle Versions,"This commentary is a classic and FF Bruce does a great job.Don't be fooled into thinking it is actually useful if you are in seminary studies. It doesn't actually tell you what the page number is, and there is no way of getting it. So when it come time to quote you get something like:Bruce, Frederick Fyvie (2010-04-12). The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians (Kindle Locations 946-950). Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Kindle Edition.I have tried pushing the menu button, still no page numbers.Eerdmans should be ashamed of letting this thing out the door for only $1 off the print price."
5,Memories of my Dad,"This is a CD that all Latin families will or should have. My Dad would play this almost every Sunday and it will be forever stamped in my heart of his memories and Mom's. Aside from that feeling, this whole CD is one of the world's best romantic scores you will ever hear. Even if you do not understand the songs. Every score is perfect and soothing, sad, or express's a love everyone wants to feel.It was a magical perfect blend when Eydie Gorme and the Los Pancho's met that one night in New York. The rest is history."
2,Does anyone know what a review is?,"A review is not an entire play by play synopsis of the film. A buyer can look at the actual Amazon info on the film to find out what it's about! A revie is your opinion of the film, and what you liked and disliked about it, and if you recommend it, or not. C'mon people!This movie is OK, but not as funny as the classic Martin & Lewis classic of the same title. Don't be fooled, this DVD doesn't have dean martin or Jerry lewis in it. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you can get it for dirt cheap!"
3,Best making it yourself.,"It's a nice item, but there is nothing included in this kit that the average homeowner doesn't have sitting around the house anyhow. The long and short of it is that my daughter enjoyed pressing things enough to where I had to build a larger press board myself as this one is fairly small.There is nothing wrong with this kit, but it's small and you can make a sturdier and larger one with less expense, plus cutting it and drilling the holes is simple enough of a project that you can do it with the child and add to the time you spend with them."
3,mixed,"there's really not a lot to this little book. the 1/2 for helping men - is better than the half for grieving men, it really didn't help me that much, but I see how it might be helpful for someone helping a man - so it's worth it for that I think. it really didn't help me through this much."
2,Tell Us More!,I was looking for information about when Jane Goodall touched the first chimp but this only said that it tells you about that in the video! We want information when we come looking at this article!
5,GOOD PRODUCT,"Works great, Installed easily. It has already been successful in shutting off my pump after an open pipe drained my system of water pressure.It was a bit time consuming re-pressurizing my system but a lot better than replacing a pump."
5,I have them,I had no idea they would get to be this mutch and I have all the books I really do love those books they where my first manga really a good buy...
5,A Really Great Book,"This book is great for a lot of reasons. First, no Rini. I know, a lot of people like her, but I don't exactly, however I do like Diana. Second, the 3 lights. I think my favorite is Yaten. They're all so cool though! Third, new and cool villians. Sailor Lead Crow is really cool looking. I also like Sailor Iron Mouse because she's really weird. Galexia is just... cool. (that's the only word for it!) Fourth, I also like ChibiChibi, who is very sweet and cute. I really look foward to book 2 because this book kind of left you at a clifthanger. All in all, this is a really great book, and it is defintly worth your money. *bye!*"
5,Awesome,"This story arch had so much awesomeness in it, from sailors from previously unheard of planets (fictitious in our reality) as well as the return of Sailorsaturn eventually. I just wish Minimoon would stop coming back, she got really old after a while. I especially liked the cover of this volume."
4,Whatever happened to Cincinnati Red?,"Like I know what life in California is all about,but man, can't Hawkins spend some quality time with godfearing people? Like why is he always writing about sex,dope,booze and cats? I mean there are other more meaningful things in life. I think he should write a story about organic radishes. Oh man, I almost forgot. I really liked Cincinnati Red and hope he writes more about her, like where is she now. Whatever, I hope she stopped smoking cigarettes."
3,readable but tentative,"This book was quite readable, though it ended making me feel unsatisfied. What was the point of the narrative? There were moments when it felt quite like Henry James, rich in detail but what, in the end, did it mean? Fuller is a proto modernist. Still, it was interesting to read a book set in a recognizable Chicago, instead of New York or Boston. Oh, sorry, Evanston was the setting. (Genteel Evanston is to Chicago as Cambridge is to Boston.) Well, I had never read a Fuller novel until now."
2,If only I could watch the computer and do yoga at the same time,"I obviously made a mistake - when I rented this I assumed I would be able to follow along and do the yoga as well. But this is nothing more than a demonstration, not something you can follow along unless you know how to watch your computer and do yoga at the same time. Where there is instruction it's mostly not in English and some sequences are just the students demonstrating without any instruction at all. To be fair, the title of this video makes it clear it's a demonstration, but as a die hard yoga fan desperate for an authentic yoga video, I was extremely disappointed that this really was not anything more than a visual demonstration. It is a great yoga practice and I would have definitely given this 5 stars if only I could follow along without having to look up from whatever position I'm in to see what to do next. It would have been nice if the instructor described the moves so I could actually do the yoga as well."
2,Waste of money,"While I appreciate Pavel's instruction and expertise, this video is a waste of money. You are better off researching the exercises on youtube for free. I have been using kettlebells for the last five years and this is my first Pavel video. I was expecting a lot more for my money. I own three Art of Strength videos and they are much better than watching Pavel just demoing the exercises."
5,The Best Pure Rock Album Ever,"While I admit that Brian Howe is not a replacement for Paul Rodgers, Bad Company clearly has not lost a step in producing rock and roll. Every song on this album is driving rock and roll. Although Howe is no match for the vocals of Paul Rodgers, Bad Company has provided him with 13 opportunities to show what he's got; and he delivers."
3,Not as Pictured/Described,"Each of these balls is a single dull color (the ones I got were blue and orange), not bright and multi-colored as in the picture. They were much smaller than I realized they would be, maybe an inch in diameter. They are made of a hard rubber and do bounce and skitter around the floor appealingly. My cats weren't too impressed, but some cats or very small dogs might find them fun for fetch or interactive play."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,I thought this book gave a great overview of the death sentence in America. The history of the death sentence and the laws that govern it was very informative and interesting..The book read like a novel and I would recommend it to anyone wanting more information on this subject.
3,kind of creepy...,"I think this video is kind of creepy. My nanny agreed with me. The whole hugging thing is a little uncomfortable and you can see that some of the kids are uncomfortable, too. My daughter, who is almost 3, seems to like it OK, but liked one of the other Animal Jams better."
3,Puzzles Are Fun but not Integrated,"A much better game than the original Schizm (at least on CD-ROM, I've heard the DVD version was great). Puzzles are challenging, but aren't very well integrated into the game. The storyline is pathetic considering it was written by a ""real"" science fiction author! Graphics are good, but for some reason aren't as engaging as others in the genre. Good user-interface. As far as the voice acting, let's just say that a certain female in the end destroys anything positive I have to say about the voice acting in this game. She was absolutely the worst voice actress I have EVER heard!!!"
4,summer reading,i've read the all 3 books in the trilogy and enjoyed all 3. great for beach reading and i found them entertaining.sorry but i won't revel any plots.enjoy!
5,CHAUEAU STYLE LOOM RUG .,"I LOVE THIS RUG , IF IT WAS AVAIABLE AGAIN WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE .PLUSH AND A GREAT VALUE . SHIPPED PROMPTLY . NO ISSUES . ALL GOOD ."
2,Ughhh Should Forget this one!,Ok...It is usually easy For me to get started on a book..This was the worst!!!..It didnt grab me at all...I picked up and put it down 10 times within a week...I would definately FORGET this one...Try Bad things...or Haunted..Much better reads!
3,Not great,Interesting premise but never was scary. Appreciated the lack of bloody scenes but would have loved a little scare. I have never read anything else by this writer but her writing is good enough to give her another try.
2,It was not as interesting as it should have been..,"This was the first book of Tamara's that I have read and, sadly, it was quite disappointing. Will Banning is totally clueless when it comes to women. He has no backbone to stick up to his evil brother. My suggestion? Read it only if there is nothing else to read."
5,Great Product,"Love this - especially nice for traveling as it is compact. The ""pen"" is easy to use and the product is a great moisturizer for cuticles = not greasy or messy."
1,comes apart too easy,"I agree witht the other reviewers that stated that the scissors come apart too easily. They are designed so that you can take the two parts off of each other if you open them very wide. The hinge ""nut"" is shaped to release the blades from each other when opened. But I found that in just regular use they would want to fall apart.Also I wasn't so crazy about the feel of these soft grips. They left room for an air cushion inside the center part of the handles but with a strong grip you just feel the hollow space under the cushion layer; I found this to be irritating. I choose these because I could get all four fingers in the handle and I liked that but these are going back."
3,Effective historical game,"While not exaclty riveting players with it's compelling gameplay, Egyptian Prophecy does a decent job at using the traditional 1st person adventure format and applying it to the ancient egypt setting..Gamplay moves along without dragging too hard, and the authenticity helps immerse the player in the culture of the era..I wish more of these kinds of games would be better invested in by both developer and player, for the combination of fact and fun, history and imagination, usually makes for more inspired game environments then most.."
2,Egyptian Prophecy Bites the Dust,"Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was rather disappointed by this depthless puzzle game. The game is advertised as an adventure in Egypt but it is possible to complete this game in only a matter of hours. The game consists of figuring out a few puzzles, and interacting only with only designated characters. Exploration is also limited and once you have finished the puzzle, there is no point in playing again."
1,Very Inconsistent Connect Speed,"I wanted to upgrade my modem to V92 technology, since my ISP was set up for that, so the US Robotics 5699B seemed to be what I needed. However, when I installed the modem and updated with the latest driver, my connection speed was usually 26.4 kbps, or lower, and only rarely did it go higher. I contacted the tech at US Robotics and he suggested several things, some of which I told him I had already completed. Nothing worked to improve the connection speed. My old Conexant modem consistently connected at 48.0 kbps, but did not have the V92 technology. I have reinstalled my old modem and now connecting at 48.0 kbps. It would seem that this modem is defective. I will probably not consider another US Robotics modem!"
1,No good ... do not buy it (XPPro),"Gosh..This modem is no good! I have bad phone line, that is why I purchased this modem (I heard USR makes the best of a bad line). Install was easy but I experienced these conditions:1) The Control Center would not find the modem.2) Connection speeds always slower than my laptop3) Would disconnect all the time (1 to three minutes max connection)It is going back to the store for more shelf life...."
2,Nothing special,"It's not natural at all. They try to make you that you're in heaven, but in the contrary, too much remix image makes it worse. I don't suggest to buy this one, especially you're new to HD world."
2,Planet Earth meets Fantasia meets Pink Floyd,"I could only stand this DVD for about 15 minutes. My wife finally said, ""Please put on something else, it's giving me a headache!"" I tried it out from Netflix before deciding to buy. I didn't care for the ""music,"" nor did I care for the tidbits of animation layered over the nature scenes. I did like the nature scenes on their own; I just wish they had left them alone. Granted, this sort of thing is subjective, and while I can see why some people might really enjoy it (thus two stars instead of one), it is certainly not for me, nor for my wife, for that matter, so two votes against."
4,Worth it for the soundtrack,"I know others here don't like the soundtrack. I loved it. If you are into Michael Stearns, Steve Roach, etc, the disc is a must-have since the soundtrack seems to be nowhere for purchase (or download, come to think of it).The HD quality is up to par, and is mixed with CGI here and there, though it is somewhat subtle in some parts. Not sure where the island is that they shot this, but is somewhere very remote. On the nitpicking side of things, the music doesn't flow very well from one song to another. You'll have one scene that is really upbeat, like Jan Hammer's stuff, then really mellow like Steve Roach, then back up to a quick paced song on another part of the landscape. All in all worth it, imho, except for that bit of quibble."
3,jewelry organizer,"Found the item for my college daughter to save on space & also purchased several more for future gifts. No zippers on the pockets, which doesn't work for moving! My daughter loaded up her jewels & when it was folded over, everything started falling out. Big tangle mess! A great idea but disappointing, not sure if I will keep the extras."
5,Finally got my jewelry organized!,"This hanging jewelry organizer actually holds all my jewelry in a useful organized way that's easy to see. It has enough large pockets to hold necklaces and matching earrings plus plenty of small pockets. I had tried a variety of jewelry boxes, plastic compartment boxes, etc. and this is the best thing I have used."
1,not worth it,"I thought this was very tacky looking, difficult to place items inside each little pocket. Too large to bother to return it. Useless for necklaces."
5,handy-dandy organizer,"I received one of these organizers as a gift, and liked it so much that I bought several more as gifts. There is plenty of space, and everything is very visible and easy to access. It looks neat and clean, and well yes,,,,,,,,organized. Doesn't take up much space at all."
4,A good organizing tool,"I like this product. Like others have noted, this is NOT a travel item. I LOVE mine as it is easy to use and I can find my earrings, pins, and other small items MUCH faster than I ever could before. Taking out and putting back is easier than ever and help me keep my items put away. Mine stays in one place and doesn't get moved around, other than to turn it around to see the other side (a swivel at the top would be nice). If you need a way to organize earrings and other small items that is convenient and easy to use, then you may find this product to your liking.I'm considering buying another one of these for my scrapbooking embellishments because I can see what I have at a glance. :-)I would like a travel version of this product, something that has flaps or velcro or something to anchor the jewelery, allow folding for suitcase packing, and a way to hang on a standard closet hanger."
3,Jewelry Organizer,This is constructed fairy well and takes up little room. It would be nice if all the pockets weren't the same size. Some bulkier necklaces and thicker bracelets won't fit. Other than that it works well.
4,Bought in 2007 and still using!,"When I got married in 2006, my husband and I moved together into a little house, and more specifically, moved the four-poster bed my mother gave as a wedding present, into our little bedroom. There was not much space for any other furniture! I bought this jewelry organizer in 2007 to save space and increase convenience in choosing jewelry for my outfits and today, in 2012, it is still in excellent condition!Yes, it's true that the ""big"" pockets aren't big enough, but jewelry that need more space than what's being held by this organizer doesn't get lost in a box or a drawer the way the small stuff do.I hang it on a hook against a wall in my little bedroom. My complaint is that when it's full of jewelry, it's really heavy to turn to see the other side, so if you can, hang it somewhere you can access both sides without turning it."
4,Sturdy - pockets a bit smaller than I thought,Glad I bought the sturdy canvas hanger. It is heavy but allows me to keep a large amount of my smaller jewelry pieces. It takes very little space in my closet (next to my new belt organizer)Received very promptly. Pleased with purchase.
5,Love this organizer!,The minute I received this product I couldn't wait to get all of my small pieces of jewelry organized. I was able to separate all of my small pieces of jewelry have have them on display where I could see each piece instantly. This saves me a lot of time in the morning when I am getting ready for work. I don't have to go throuh my jewelry cabinet searching for a piece to wear. I love this item! I would also recommend getting the Necklace/bracelet organizer also.
2,Jewelry Bag,"I really needed a multi pocket jewelry bag, and this would have been absolutely perfect, except for one thing. It has no zippers. I am not sure how the product manufacturers thought one could keep jewelry in this bag without anything falling out of it. I travel frequently, so it would have fit the bill had it had zippers. Maybe next time."
4,"Sturdy, from hanger to pockets","This organizer is made of sturdy materials, from the hangers to the cotton canvas and vinyl pockets. Worth the 15 bucks. Great for organizing small pieces. However,* I wish it is less sturdy then with a lower price. The job for holding jewelry doesn't need that sturdiness.* necklaces need a better way to display. In those small pockets, the chains are stacked on themselves."
1,made me die a little inside,"watching this movie made me stare outside of my window picturing me jumping outit made me wonder if i was ever a prisoner in a country somewhere if it would be used for torture,i concluded that it would be okay to watch it after a couple of days in prisonthe movie starts off allright, the music when that silly guy walks was quite hilarious,although the acting was pretty bad where the girl gets lost,the movie then starts getting confusing when the guy with the hands outfit starts talking to the rockit hurts my stomach just remembering this filmhowever i will be buying a copy for my friend,i can already picture his face"
1,Abomination!,"Family man Michael (Hal Warren), his wife Margaret (Dianne Maherr) and daughter Debbit (Jackie Neyman Jones) travels on vacation as they stumble to the Valley Lodge. They soon find a creepy mangoat-like fellow named Torgo (John Reynolds) helps them to their rooms until his evil master (Tom Neyman) traps them into a horrifying nightmare.One of the worst films of all time! this stinky abortion of a movie has one of the worst plots in the history of film plus rotten acting, horrible production values, lathargic pacing, and all that sort of thing but does have a good jazzy soundtrack which helps the level of this excretment. Thank god for Mystery Science Theater 3000 riffing this mess apart and you can feel the pain they suffered through this movie.Watch only the MST3K version."
4,Story makes sense later,"I had no problems with this. I have a Dell that is about a year and a half old. Everything ran just fine, but thatnks to the other reviewers. Their information helped. What I liked was there is no filler in this game. It just jumps right in and goes with no in between shots of walking down hallways or long explanations of things just to go through the motions. It really speeds along once you figure out what to do and does not hold you back. But it also lets you play at your own pace. Once you get through it the story makes a lot more sense although at first I couldn't see it. It's also funny which is nice for a change."
2,Corny and made little sense to me,"This game was just bizzare. I rarely laughed at the corny humor that saturates the gameplay--I usually rolled my eyes. I thought the navigation was illogical and frustrating as well. This is one of those games that I forced myself to finish, and was glad when it was over. Still, it had enough challenge in it to keep me going, so it wasn't a total waste. I've definitely played worse games (like Conspiracies)."
1,Dreadful,"Had a heck of a time trying to run it on XP which only added to the unavoidable realization that this ""adventure game"" is a complete waste of a person's time and energy. I couldn't tell you much in the way of storyline because my computer would freeze up every 10 sec. I gave up trying to go past the 1st chapter. Who needs this aggravation. Root canal is more pleasant."
1,Stunned,"My boyfriend and I played this game together. When we finished we sat and looked at each other with ""deer-caught-in-the headlights"" looks on our faces. The game comes with a walkthrough: it has to because you would never know what was going on without it. The puzzles make no sense, the story makes no sense, the ending, especially the ending MAKES NO SENSE. Then there is the horrible, want-to-poke-your-eyeball-out-with-a-spoon HUMOR. I gave this game 1 star because you can't give no stars."
3,OK,This game was OK. It was not a 5 star game. But it was not a 5 star price. So that's OK. I got a few days of fun and enjoyed it.
5,Love this magazine!,We had received some free issues in the past and were satisfied enough to purchase a subscription. We always use the coupons in the magazine and love the tips and advice on raising our baby.
1,NEVER GOT IT!,Seems like the ball was dropped here. I never received my subscription and I've been at the same address for over 4 years. I'm sure the magazine is nice....just wish I would have got what I ordered.
1,No Magazine After 4 Weeks...,"Ordered Parenting 11-16. Been over 4 weeks and still no magazine. Is it coming, Amazon? Next time I'll go to the magazine site and order there directly rather than through a third party vendor site."
5,LIKE IT,Quality product and should last longer than my 30 year old plywood one that I busted due to too many beers. Got it in 2 days too!!!!!!
4,great research tool,do not look to this for excitment and swahbuckling action/adventure. It is purely a research tool and requires serious background to understand the relationships that it recounts. It provides a significant insight into the warlike and fractious cculture of medieval Ireland
3,Young Jerry Rivera,"Young Jerry Rivera at work before he came out with his GREATEST ALBUM EVER ""Abriendo Puertas"" as a young Singer Jerry was amazing along with all the great salseros of the 1990's"
5,La mejor monografía disponible sobre el jaguar.,"Magnífica monografía de carácter científico escrita por dos expertos a partir de sus trabajos de campo en contacto directo con el jaguar. Centrada en la región venezolana de Los Llanos, proporciona información de primera mano sobre la ecología, el comportamiento y las necesidades de conservación del jaguar. Apéndice con datos sobre rasgos morfológicos del jaguar tomadas ""in situ"". A menudo, las características biométricas de grandes félidos publicadas en muchos trabajos especializados no explicitan variables fundamentales que pueden dar lugar a importantes sesgos: estado físico del animal, edad, sexo, hábitat, etc. que sí tienen en cuenta los autores. Incluye fotografías a color que complementan acertadamente el texto. Disponible también en español en el mismo sello editorial."
3,"Quite skimpy, but not bad to a newcomer","When I read this book, I had been a fan of Brando for several years and for that reason, this book was probably not an ideal choice. However, to a newcomer of the great actor, or to anyone curious about his life but without the time to read a larger, more thorough biography, I think this book would serve its purpose fairly well. It covers most of Brando's work from the late 1940's on, when he was a star on Broadway, through his movies of the 50s and 60s, up to THE GODFATHER of 1972. Brando's childhood years are barely given any attention, but there are a few anecdotes of his life outside of the screen to be found as well. Brando's autobiography ""Songs My Mother Taught Me"" is really the book to go for if you seek a more thorough and mature perspective on his life, but this little book is still decent enough, if taken for what it is."
4,kind of worked,"It worked well in some areas but did not seep into other areas and was blotchy I have a Volvo btw and maybe it was my matterial I definately see how it would work great on some materials I tried to clean the area 2 days later even better than when I began,,, and poof all of it came off,,, but I have a lot left will try again. I do think it is a pretty good product my high-impact molding is being a pain in the buttocks."
4,Stunning Documentary on Amazing Locations,"The 411 by Maria:I was very interested in viewing this as my husband's family if from Vigo Spain and go there 6 months of the year. Not a bad life huh? Well, I have yet to be there even though there would be a beautiful place to stay with people who know exactly where to go and what to do. We are not in a position to plan a vacation any time soon. I LOVED this video. Hearing how beautiful it is from my family isn't the same as seeing a well produced movie of the area.Gorgeous! I can completely see why they long to go back every 6 months. They come here for the grand-kids but Spain is there home. Truly a beautiful place to live and after seeing this I want to visit and see the history I have heard them speak of for the past 20 years of my life. Portugal is the second destination featured. With stunning landscapes and amazing food! If you love visually stunning journeys which you can take right from your living room. This is the DVD for you."
2,Stale,"I was very disappointed with this one. Sadly, while his 60's/70's releases still completely fresh and revolutionary, this already sounds out of date and clichéd, and unusually commercial for Iggy, who I've always admired for his ability to be himself. Has Iggy run out of ideas?"
1,Boring,"I couldn't get through the whole CD because it was deathly boring. Stupid lyrics, uninspired playing, lack of originality. Some of it sounded like he was trying to imitate Lou Reed, but the imitation was poor. Every song sounded like something you've heard a million times before on one of those classic rock stations that is still reliving the 1970s. I did like the song ""Candy"", which briefly broke up the monotony."
4,A Potential First Time Horse Owner 'Must Read',"Anyone contemplating the addition of a horse to their family who has little or no experience around these wonderful animals should read this book FIRST! While it may be a bit overkill in places regarding safety and care, the vast majority of the information contained is MUST DO! Horses aren't dogs, cats or a set of golf clubs. This book lays out the good and the bad of horse ownership and most importantly what it takes to properly care for your 1,000 pound 'baby'."
1,Not User Friendly,"I received Video Studio 5 with my Firewire controller. I am extremely disappointed in this program. It is not user friendly in any way. There are tips and step by step instructions, but they are unclear and not precise. I spent almost an hour trying to insert a transition between 2 frames. The directions give 2 methods of performing this action. The first method- clicking the selected transition and dragging it doesn't work at all. You can drag it everywhere on the screen EXCEPT in between two frames. The second method is to click on a button that does not exist in the effects mode. If I leave the effects mode, the button is there, but then I can't very well add any effects.After fussing with this program for over an hour, I switched to Windows Media Movie Maker and had my short little clip completed and exported to the internet in less than 20 minutes.Don't waste your time or money on Ulead Video Studio 5!"
2,Don't be fooled!!!!,"As a very serious collector of Christmas movies, music video's, records, and tapes. PLEASE beware that this is nothing more than advertising for his place in Branson. You never do get to see a ""Kenny Rogers- The Christmas Show"". Very little of this video is worth your time. It is a shame I had to find out the hard way."
5,Tackling the real issues,"Although written a while ago, as one can clearly tell, the novel tackles the relevant issues from Climate Change to Financial Crisis and it also envisions a president in the White House who wants to do his best but first runs against a concrete wall of lobbyists - until he meets a penguin! There is no better analysis to our present crisis than this book. Moreover, it shows a way out!"
1,worst book I've to used ever!,"I wonder how come this book come to its second edition!? Not pedagogical, not suffienct examples.It's not for beginners and absolutely not for advanced ones.It's crap!"
5,Excellent Historical Pictoral History...,"An amazing collection of photos, stories, and history from the archives of the most noted lucha photographer ever... Lordes Grobet thrusts the reader into the world of lucha libre and immerses them in the moments that made history..."
4,Great Product,"Product was everything that was described. Snug fit for normal shoes, but can fit one shoe in each pocket. Product was very durable and would buy from again."
4,I choose this one ...,"I looked at a bunch of different shoe organizers and finally decided on this one. It fits perfect over the door, my door still closes fine, an it's pretty sturdy. I couldn't fit my husbands shoes in it, but my shoes (even platforms 5inch heels) fit in them fine. I am starting to notice small tears in the corner of some pockets an I have only had it for about a month. But then again I am putting heavy heels in them .. so it's probably my fault."
3,Good about integrating mind and body in dieting,"The most valuable aspect of this book is the psychological. The mind is a crucial ally in this battle to lose weight, and the author realizes that the ""mind"" part of losing weight has not been addressed in most other diets. However, the diet itself is more complicated than Atkins or Protein Power, and some of the limitations he imposes are not explained (I mean, I'm not going to measure out my mustard, for gosh sakes!) Therefore, to me, this book is best used to supplement other low-carb plans."
5,Nice set,These are full size tools. I guess I was expecting a smaller set but these are really nice. They feel solid and durable.
5,Great Teak Shower,"This shower was very easy to assemble, and not only does it looks great but it is also pretty sturdy. The shower platform is much bigger that I thought it would be. It is a great item to have for any pool owner...."
4,Gift,"This was a perfect christmas gift for my radko loving friend. Great price, shipped quickly and can not beat it."
2,"Beautiful illustrations, unique poetry and quotes, but ...","... the pages are thin (you can see illustrations and writing through them) and are gloss-coated, which makes it difficult to find the right type of pen. In addition, the book doesn't say it's archival, lignin- and acid-free paper - a must with baby keepsakes. It's lovely to look at, but not practical. I'd pass on this one, despite the cover and the illustrations."
3,Married at midnight,"It's not easy to rate four stories with one mark, so I do it one by one:The determined bride"" - I give it 3 stars. It's not a bad story, but I found something missing there.A kiss after midnight"" - nice, but just a little bit unbelievable. How Victoria couldn't recognize her best friend? I don't believe a man can change so much! And that marriage ceremony ... oh, it was sooo long, I became unpatient! 3 stars.Scandal's bride"" - a bit cliche. I read so many books about London high society of 19th century I became tired of them. Why always London and 19th century? Why not France during 100 years war for example? 3 stars.Beyond the kiss"" - out of question the best of Married at midnight"". I just love Woodiwiss and Birminghams. 5 stars.And at the end - romance authors, keep writting. We need your stories to warm our hearts and make our lives easier."
5,"Steve & Eydie, the best!","Steve & Eydie, best duo ever in pop music, reissued in cd format one of the best 2-4-1s ever. I always preferred the 2nd album on lp, but, now with cd, the 1st sounds just as great! Most songs are duets & the couple compliment each other like no other 2. In one of the few serious numbers, Sunrise Sunset, Eydie & Steve harmonies surpass the Fiddler on the Roof actors who have done it. Most songs here are fun songs which are just what Mr & Mrs. do best or at least better than anyone else. I've known way too many people who dismiss S&E as ""lounge music"" not worth taking seriously. But, I say fun songs & Broadway songs deserve respect as much as blues or rock & roll. I feel Broadway has given us our artiest material, our ""Shakespearian Drama"" of pop music. No one does these 22 Broadway tunes better than Steve & Eydie!"
3,Uninspired effort,"I am a fan of R. Ashcroft ever since the Verve days. I was expecting a great album after a 3-year absence, but this album is very forgetable. Break the night with colour - is a great tune, but some of the others are so weak that even the orchestration cannot help to save them. He is just 'Stuck in A Moment he cannot get out of' as U2 would say. C'mon Richie, snap out of it. This formula is getting old, and BORING. You're better than this. You are overproducing the records, which is a sign that the material is weak. Write some decent songs."
2,Lite FM,"I am a big Verve fan as well as most of Ashcroft solo work. He has some truly great tunes but also often gets carried away in overproduction and cheesy, generic, soft, lyrics and melodies- this one is by far his worst effort. The only song with any edge or bite is Break the Night- the rest would be great for my mom to put on during Christmas dinner. It's all Hallmark-type save the world, Neil Diamond sappy garbage. He went much more toward lite FM edge from the past rather than edgy stuff like Check the Meaning or God in the Numbers- just look at song titles- Words get in the Way, Why do Lovers, Keys to the World, Cry til Morning- I think he spent way too much time with Chris Martin this time around- sad to see because I was really looking forward to this"
2,Didn't Make Me Lose My Head,"Aside from a quick breast shot, and the occasional ""bad"" word, this movie seemed to be made for ABC Family. If I was 13, I would've fully enjoyed this film. As an adult,it was kind of lackluster. The storyline was a bit rushed and unrealistic. (even for a horror film) Nick Carter is hot as hell, but he needs some acting classes. Kevin Zegers and Stacy Keach's characters are the only two worth mentioning. Judge Reinhold's performance was just plain embarrassing. I did like the setting of the film. It took me back to when I was a teen. I will say, it wasn't boring. It did keep me entertained, but I was VERY disappointed with the overall storyline."
2,It''s hollow,"The title describes what you'll feel after watching this terrible movie. It's not scary and must use a little skin to titalize, instead of horror to scare. Nick Carter is horrible, and Cuocoo is one dimentional. A really bad horror movie, that has nothing to do with Irving's classic."
5,very good movie,"This is a very good movie, and great to watch on Halloween night. the End leaves you a bit stumped, but the rest is great."
2,HOLLOW MAN 2,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL BUT STILL A DECENT MOVIE. NOW I HAVE ONE AND TWO, IT FEELS COMPLETE"
2,a mad letdown,"ive been on a mad kick lately and have ordered alot of the mad compilations offered on this site. most of them i have been pretty happy with. this is one of the few exceptions.i was expecting this to be more inline with some of the other offerings such as Mad about Superheroes or Mad about the 80's. this is instead a very small, thin book.its kinda confusing because mad has such a large library and could have easily filled a book 10 times this size.its barely a book, its more of a pamplet."
2,One talent wasted besmirching another,"May we all live to see the day when the present fad of mixing up biography with criticism ends! Once again a critic (i.e., wannabe artist) does her best to soil the work of a truly creative artist by trying to impose her own notions of his life on his work. Or is it the other way around--imposing notions of the work onto the life? It hardly matters--the result is the same. Nothing of substance is said about either, and in the process of saying nothing, she drags in all kinds of ugliness. Of course all the while, the author is claiming to be a great admirer of Johns, even as she purveys her gossip and hearsay. Finally, as is usually the case with such psychographers, she's just revealing her own unsavory motives and hungering ego. The only reason I give the book two stars is that she's not a bad writer. Too bad she had to waste her talent on such a project."
3,Abandoned,Abandoned? That sorry father of his went to his mothers house and stole him from the playpen which was outside. Those men could do anything and get away with it. The grandfather literally ruled the town. Big Fish in a Wee town. That's the story I heard all my life and there was no reason for mama to lie--she was on the scene at the time. The snoopy author didn't talk to enough people.
2,Crude Slant,If you could just pick out some of the info it would be interesting; but her crude slant on everything was rather pathetic. It was like trying to see the big dipper thru a small crack in the wall of an outhouse.
1,Redundant and very basic information available on the internet,"Gout Hater's Cookbook series is a collection of books, approximately 100 pages each. 1/3 of the information in each book is redundant and cut and pasted from book to book. Information is relatively outdated and the recipes are so simple that one does not need these books to find useful recipes. The price is outrageous. The entire series could have been collected in one small book that could be priced under $20.00. The author has taken advantage of the patinet's need for information and has made what would constitute a chapter into a book so that she could sell more books. Avoid buying these series. Use internet."
3,Gout Hater's Cookbook 111,I expected more and better receipes. I did however find the informationon gout and the different levels of purine catagories helpful.
5,At Last - An ORIGINAL Story!,"My children (8 and 9 years old) and I LOVED reading this book together. It is imaginative, exciting, and hilarious. The story is long enough to be satisfying, unlike many children's chapter books. There are plenty of adventures, mishaps galore, and goofy little rhymes my kids still laugh about. How does a quiet country town rid itself of both ravenous wolves and pantry-raiding polecats? Find a copy of this book anywhere you can and learn how. I highly recommend this chapter book for reading alone or reading aloud."
5,Queen Bees and Wannabees,Excellent book for anyone that has a teen. It help you get insde the head of a high schooler
2,Rough and disappointing,"I thought this book would be helpful to my daughters as they raise young girls into the teenage years. I purchased the book to give to them. Now that I have read it, I don't think this book would be helpful to them. Having raised daughters myself and now the grandmother of many granddaughters, I feel I can speak from experience. I was particularly taken back by the quoted text that was supposed to be what young girls actually said. Not all girls act the way she portrayed in the book nor do they have such mean motivations. I found the book negative, full of quick stereotypes, and slanted. Not everyone needs to be put in a stereotype so quickly. There are some truths in the book, but you have to use discernment in reading it to have a balanced view of teenage girls."
3,Queen Bees & Wannabes,"I thought this book would be more young girl read friendly. It is geared more toward adults, which is OK I guess."
5,Great for Daughters AND Their Mothers,"Finally! A book with practical information to actually HELP a teenage girl navigate the treacherous waters of adolecence. This book has advice wth actions for girls to take in common negative situations, plus special advice for parents on how to help.Wiseman is a positive force for girls (and their parents) everywhere. I saw her on Oprah and wish she had her own TV show to help out even more girls.I've bought copies for all my friends with daughters - even the ones too young to need this book - yet!"
2,Spying on the rites of the BONA DEA,"Having grown up with no sisters, the female mind is even more of a mystery to me than it is to most men. As a former high school teacher I had to deal with the sorts of girls described in the book, and found it helpful. I only gave it two because what mere male can really know the inner workings of the female mind?"
3,Meh,"The author is quite preachy, even if what she says strikes many chords with us. I just get tired quickly of her writing style. ""Now I'm going to school you idiot parents on xyz..."""
4,fascinating....almost too fascinating,"there's a plethora of reader's perspectives one could take into accessing this fantastic work, that reads as quickly and easily as a novel (minus the stopping upon having your own personal schema accessed). this is a brilliant gender studies read as well as a potential parenting guide...unfortunately, the book ends almost too quickly, not fully joining all loose ends, and merely glancing at the notions of boys in the world of high school politics."
5,Excellent book on Chord Progression,"In this book, Kenneth shows you different kinds of chord progression, mostly leading to the Tonic ( I chord ). He explains the use of all kinds of chords, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths, etc. and how these can be applied in your chord progressions. Examples are given and there are just tons of information on how to add 'color' to your progressions. An excellent book."
5,A Gentle Presence Teaches Meditation,"Easwaran offers us a concise and complete method of meditation -- as well as a method of growing into our Christedness. His gentle expression draws us into his mind set, showing us how we may become similarly centered and ""on purpose."" A marvelous book from an enlightened being."
4,Cute pocket pistol lookalike,"If you love Colt automatics as I do, you'll get a kick out of this. Quite a nostalgia trip, package even has historical details about Samuel Colt. I never had the pocket Colt but this tickled me. Surprisingly realistic, fun to shoot around the house. Low power but functions well."
5,Great little pisol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is probubly my best airsoft gun! The little thing hold 15 rounds of bbs per mag! It is at 150 FPS! Not that much but its a lot for this little pistol! Good for beginers first airsoft gun. Comes with 30 day warranty. Good for small hands or kids! netal safty and triger. And Iam prity sher the guns made of ABS plastic! Very nice pistol for short range! Very easy to cock! I will strongly recormed this for kids!!!!! Takes .12 gram bbs. Very good colt. Recomend to any airsofter or begining airsofter!
2,Hope you like to repeat yourself..,"Since other reviews touched on gameplay and it's graphics, I just want to say this...1. Sure, your surroundings are a pretty picture.. but I like games that are interactive. I want to go through drawers, look closer at pictures.. do something besides run around busy rooms that you can do nothing but run through.2. The plot is weak. I won't spoil the story-line, but each in game day you pretty much go to the same places, talking to the same people. You have to meet certain requirements to make the game progress, and non of it is interesting.The one thing I did like about the game, there are a couple real nice songs you can listen to while you play, or just wait in one of the bars and listen.Unfortunately, I got this as a present for my mom, thinking it would be a puzzle game and be creepy. Buzz, wrong!"
3,I beg to differ on the horrible reviews,"Okay, so I admit that I am not the most PC game savvy and for this reason, I enjoyed this game. It is very similar to Post Mortem and Still Life (not surprising, as they are made by the same company). Yes, it is tedious and repetitive, but it is simple, puzzles are easy, the story is linear, you can't really screw up, and I appreciate this in a game! The graphics are pretty cool, as is the music.I play adventure games to pretend I am really there, in the game, trying to figure out the mystery. I don't need shoot-em-ups or puzzles that take me all day to figure out. If you're like me, you'll probably enjoy this game. You just need to go into it knowing that you are not looking at an Oscar-caliber experience. Take it for what it's worth and you may just have some fun! :)"
2,What a let down,The music was good. That is all I can find good to say about this game. The ending was very disappointing to me. What a let down. The game play itself was boring and dragged on .
2,Far too predictible,"This book was way too predictible, you know the ""big secret"" about 100 pages in. But, I liked these characters a lot. Prudence/Angel is a pistol and a lot of fun for the reader. Banning is the perfect romantic gentleman, quite charming."
5,An impressive album,"From the opening tune of ""The Man I Used to Be"" I was impressed with this Jellyfish album. Their sparkling combination of musical influences come together wonderfully in song after song to create a distinctive style. Poignant melodies and lyrics are blended with screaming guitar solos and soaring rhythms.""She Still Loves Him"" stands out to me as one of their best. From an Elton John sounding piano intro the song breaks into a swanky rock ballad, complete with Beatles-like harmonies.For Puffy AmiYumi fans Bellybutton provides a fascinating insight into the earlier work of Andy Sturmer. His genius ability at combining both catchy and emotional songwriting permeates this impressive album.Though it came out in 1990 these songs still hold up. Highly recommended."
4,Great Companion For Cat Lovers or Otis and Milo Lovers,"This is a very huggable stuffed animal. My daughter who loves the movie Milo and Otis is in heaven with her ""Milo"" - what a great toy for cat lovers or someone looking for a well made, nice size, stuffed animal."
3,Irish Riflemen in America,"I was disappointed when I read the book. I guess I was expecting something a littledifferent.I'll pass it along. I won't make it a part of my library.If I had read excerpts from the book , or if I had been able to look at it, I would not have purchased it."
4,fun book,"Enjoyed it. Not outdated at all. It's nice to read about a woman who stands up for herself when being pushed around by societal mores and relatives, etc., especially considering the time period. This cloth-bound copy is very sturdy. I only give my absolute favorite books five stars, so four is high on my scale."
4,Love these shoes,"The only problem is that they are not true to fit. According to all the size charts, I need a 9D. However, I chose to order wider based on other reviews. Even ordering a width wider than suggested, they are still very snug."
5,Very attractive shoe,"Ordered this shoe for my Mother for Christmas. It seems to be a comfortable style for her. The hook and loop on the strap is secure, I whis it were a little longer as her feet swell sometimes."
2,where's the grease?,"unlike the picture, greased up deaf guy action figure i was sent has no grease spots on his body, which sort of misses the whole point!equally oddly, the other side of this complex character--his deafness--isn't even mentioned on the action figure packaging or in amazon's description. in spite of this, the action figure is indeed deaf. kudos to the manufacturer for getting that right.Addendum:I stand corrected. there is grease, but it is VERY subtle--not at all like the image. i couldn't see it until i took it out of the packaging and examined it under just the right lighting."
1,mine lasted 1 yr and the replacment lasted even less,I used this hairdryer every other day for about 10 min to dry my hair and after about 1 yr it started to smell like electrical wires burning and it would spark. I stopped using it and called for a replacment. I had to send the original one to them and pay for shipping and they sent me a new one. It worked great at first but then just totally stopped after a few months. It wouldn't turn on or do anything!
3,a very sweet story,"I liked this story. Buttercup Baby is sort of a sequel to Prince of Charming. In this story Ariel a fairy is sent to check on Robin Goodfellow's baby. She see's the baby and has a sudden desire to have achild of her own and in order to do that she must find a mortal male. Well she finds one alright in Rand Thayer, a friend of Robin and Kate's. She sort of attaches herself to him until his passion gets the better of him and they make love and concieve a child. Ariel ends up staying with Rand during her pregnancy and being drawn into his large family. There is a very interesting and funny scene with green Jell-o that you can't miss. This book is a nice afternoon read. I will enjoy reading more books by Karen Fox."
1,Not Worth the Money,"Like most of this author's books, this one falls far short of all the hype and promises. The table of contents promises a lot but delivers little. The information isn't bad, its just that there is very little of it here. Most of the exercises are things you can find in any stretching book, yoga class, or martial arts class.I would recommend Kurz's Stretching Scientifically,or almost any other stretching book, over this book any day! The author really doesn'tdeserve your money for this one."
2,Not Enough Substance to Outweigh the Hype,"Pavel clearly knows some good drills for improving flexibility. However, it's clear that with this more complicated topic, he can't produce anything remotely as innovative as 'Naked Warrior' or 'Power to the People'.As I said, Pavel knows some good drills and what he does would probably work. However, there are better books on the subject. Tom Kurz' 'Stretching Scientifically' comes to mind.Unfortunately, Pavel's charisma doesn't really shine through and the hype doesn't save the book from being relegated to also-ran status in the flexibilty manual stakes.I will say, however, his flexibilty video does better in terms of motivation and this book would work reasonably well with that video. The same can be said of Kurz' video and book, too, though."
3,"Good watch, but didn't last long","I bought this watch a little more than a year ago. It worked great. The atomic setting feature updated every night without a problem. I regularly used the stopwatch. All in all, a good watch with lots of nice features.The drawback to it, however, is that it's not the most durable. The cover is plastic and it scratches very easily. Within days, mine had a scratch and they steadily built up over time.The edge of the watch itself - the part where the watch connects to the band - is plastic, and that's what ultimately did in my watch. It snapped off as I was lifting something, right where the pin for the band attaches to the watch. If this had been metal, I could have just reattached the band, but because it's plastic, the watch is finished."
3,Submarine history,"This is a good quick survey of submarine history; I prefer something with a bit more on the American subs in WWII, but this is an excellent overview, with sections about British, German, American and submarines of other nations."
1,No Connect sign!!!!,"I have bought this phone here in Amazon months ago and I still can't make it work!!!. Everytime I connect it, appears a sign: ""NO CONNECT"", I tried several times here in my house and other friends's house and never worked. The same problem: ""No Connect"".Now I have here a beautifull phone wich never worked !!.I can't change it because I live outside USA, I sent it by mail, when I purchased, to a friend' house in NY. Now I have to come back there for change it or fix it? TOO EXPENSIVE!!!"
5,this phone ROCKS,"This phone is TOO COOL......I love all the ring tone choices you have...the changeable face plates are cool too, this phone is a keeper!!!!"
2,cute but not a good product,I saw this phone and fell in love with the fact that it played we will rock by queen. Once I got it home it worked for awhile until I put a powerstrip in my room. Within a week I started to get awful static regardless of where I was in the house. After calling customer service they tell me that this particular phone doesn't work anywhere near a powerstrip! (something that was NOT in the manual!) For all the cute littile features it has it really doesn't work.
5,I love it!,"I love this phone so much! I love the orange color, and the yellow, blue and red are also very cool! I love the custom ring tones, I use the Blink 182 for all my calls! And the little animation at the top is very cool. It's a very nice phone and it lights up too! I'm glad I bought this phone and it's definately worth the money."
3,can't beat the extra features... but we still returned it,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a research hound. I spent hours researching phones that were a decent price [] but still had the 2.4 GHz - and even though this Vtech phone had one bad review, I was still willing to try it out because I loved the extra features and how it would light up when you had a call come in.Unfortunately, the first night we tried it, the phone poppped and crackled and had interferance. It was awful trying to listen to it, and as far as we could tell, there was nothing interferring with the phone connection to the base.This phone might definately work for you in your home, but I was very disappointed that we had to take such a fun phone back because of the poor quality in sound."
1,INSECURE,"Note this is an ANALOG phone, despite being on the 2.5GHz spectrum, and its signal can be picked up by other wireless analog devices, like wireless headphone or speaker systems"
1,Just Another Pretty Face(plate),"I LOVED this phone in concept. I loved being able to assign rings to individual callers. I know... how lazy have we gotten that we want an even simpler step than checking the Caller ID. Still... it seemed like a really great feature. However, the first few times I used the phone, I lost the signal every single time. I tried to be patient and search out new channels but each time, there would be TONS of static (through which I found out later, the caller could hear me shouting HELLO? HELLO?) and then eventually I would get disconnected altogether. I returned the phone and, because I still really liked it in theory, I exchanged the phone for a duplicate, thinking maybe I'd just been unlucky and gotten a ""lemon"". So back home, reprogram, call and pfft. Static galore. I just wouldn't trust it enough to ever recommend it to someone. I went from loving this phone to really hating this phone."
2,Does all it says but sound quality very bad,"Phone features are as described. Easy to program rings, lots of features, color changes (if you care) also easy. Wanted to like it! But while sound coming in was ok, almost everyone I spoke to from the phone --- even when I was not far from the base -- told me sound was breaking up or I sounded like I was trapped in a tin can. If you just need a voice getting basic information across, might be ok, but if you need to sound closer to a standard corded or cell phone, either this model isn't it, or the particular one I received was faulty."
1,Third one finally worked.,"Bought this for my daughters birthday. It was new defective, VTech sent another, same thing, new defective. Finally after a month and wasting my time packing and returning the 1st two I received one that works. I wrote VTech saying they have a quality problem with this phone and asked if they could provide me a free extended service contract, they assured me the phone would be OK and I could purchase a contract if I wanted. Although VTech stood by their product and provided replacements, I feel they should have gone a little further since it's clear after my experience and the other reviews here, they have a serious quality problem."
1,PAL to NTSC Conversion Quit After 2 Years,"After 2 years of normal use, the converter quit working, so now I can only view NTSC DVDs. Warranty is 1 year on parts and a sorry 3 months on labor. I just ordered a JVC XV N412SL to replace it.Not recommended if you plan to keep it beyond the warranty period."
1,Misleading!,"This sale online to me was VERY misleading. I was under the impression that it was the actual book. However, upon opening my delivery, I discovered that it was the INSTRUCTOR'S manual. In no way shape or form, is it listed ANYWHERE that this is the instructors manual. I am very angry, and frustrated with this outcome."
2,Not what it appears to be,"THe first season isn't really the first season of Dallas in this box set. I'm a true Dallas fan. The first few episodes was actually the mini-series version, then the block of the first Season. So Season Two isn't included in this set at all! I was disappointed and wanted everyone else to know that if you're thinking about buying this set, please be aware that it doesn't include Season Two."
5,where's season 3?!,"It was great to remind me of the early 80's and oilfield lifestyle... wondering why there isn't another soap after all these years that follows the same storyline... but now, there's no need... with this dvd series I can enjoy it all again! When is season 3 coming out????"
5,Un cheuf-d'oeuvre en DVD!!!!!!!!!,"Un grand acteur de talent ce Larry Hagman(J.R.Ewing)President de la ""Ewing Oil"".A chaques épisodes,on se demande ce qu'il fera de nouveau pour mieux arriver a ses propres intérets personnels.C'est grace a ce personnage qu'on voit jusqu'a quelle point L'homme peut aller pour ""la soif du pouvoir""(trahison,corruption etc.)Bravo aussi a Jim Davis(Jock Ewing)pere,Barbarra Bel Geddes (miss elie ewing)mere,Patrick Duffy(Bobby Ewing)fils du centre,Victoria Principal(Pamela Barnes Ewing)femmes de Bobby,Linda Grey(Sue Ellen Ewing)Femme de J.R Ewing,Charlene Tilton(Lucy EWing)niece,Steve Kanaly(Ray Krebbs)Contremaitre ranch Ewing,Ken Kercheval(Clifford Barnes)frere de pamela.En un mot;une série INCONTOURNABLE!Wow!"
3,DVD of Dallas - The Complete First and Second Seasons,"The stories, acting, photography, and direction are excellent. It's nice to not have any commercial interruptions. On the other hand it is the first DVD I ever owned that was in a two-sided disc format. It came as a surprise and I'm not crazy about it. Obviously the durability of the DVD is shortened due to the high risk of scratching it."
5,Must-have DVD,"I started to watch the show 4 months ago, and Ive been hooked ever since. So naturally I had to buy this DVD. The first and second seasons episodes are some of the best episodes from the series. So if you love this show or like dramas, you should get this DVD. I cant wait for the other seasons to arrive on DVD (I hope they arrive soon)"
2,An okay collection,"The 28th Century Masters - 98 Degrees contains five videos: Invisible Man (the original black and white version), Because of You, The Hardest Thing, I Do (Cherish You), and Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche).Overall, if you are a big 98 Degrees fan and the above videos are the only ones you like, then get it. Otherwise, I would get 98 Degrees- The Collection. It's a lot better because it comes with their story as well as ALL of their videos (including the Spanish version of Give Me Just One Night)."
4,Pleasing Depth,"I like the daily ""work"" load of this study. It is not something that members of a group study can do in an hour to prepare nor is it just too demanding for those who have a busy life."
3,Complete Illustrated Guide to Tai Chi,"Was not exactly what I was looking for, not the form of Tai Chi that I wanted. It's okay, I'll find someone who can use it."
4,Loved this book,I really enjoyed reading this book. I love the desire Darcy and Elizabeth show for each other. I imagined they would have a passion such as this. Loved it! Can't wait for the 3rd book.
1,Boring and dumbing,Blah blah blah sex. Blah blah blah sex. Thats pretty much all this book is. No good storyline. No humor whatsoever which was what I loved about Jane Austen's characters. This book makes them dumb mindless sex addicts. Had to force myself to read the whole darn thing hoping for at least one good paragraph but at the end all I could think was it was written by a horny teenager with a sad understanding of the characters and a really big thesaurus.
1,disappointed,"having read the Janet Aylmer ""Darcy's Story"" (slow starter, but enjoyable), and the Carrie Bebris Pemberley mysteries(not excellent, but good enough), i was looking forward to this book. (I haven't read the first in the series...), but in a word, i found it to be pure trash, and not good trash at that. i experienced it as distasteful and as a reader i was insulted."
4,What else could happen,"I rather enjoyed the first book more so than this edition but I have read it several times now. I am not a fan of the flipping around from character to character as is done in these two books I would much rather concentrate on the main characters, however it is a good book and worth a read. I am sure I will read it again possibly just skipping over the excess of character I do not care so much about. Wickham is truely evil, Lady Catherine is never satified and little Georgiana is just as passionate as her brother is I believe. I hurt for Richard in his injuries and altered life style. Darcy always proud and distant is fun to see as a father and still in love with his Elizabeth."
2,more of the same,"I have to say, the first book in the series had me longing for something more than Boots & Lizzy in the sack, this book was more of the same. Though I'm glad that her sister finally achieves her first orgasm with Bingley, I'm not sure that's what I was hoping to read - yes, marriage can be a passionate thing and yes, the A&E/BBC Pride & Prejudice film was brilliantly done and yes, these books were largely based on this depiction BUT isn't there more to it? I suppose my biggest beef with these books is that there isn't more depicted in these books - more about Darcy and Lizzy and her transition from second daughter in the Bennett household to Mistress of Pemberly and everything that entails. I'm also not sure I needed 101 ways to say ""they shagged"" in Austen-speak."
4,Not quite as good as Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife,"I enjoyed this book very much and would buy it again, but I did enjoy Ms. Berdoll's first volume ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"" better."
5,WE WANT MORE,I am a Pride and Prejudice lover and this continuation book did not disappoint me in the least. I loved it and look forward for the author to keep writing more - by the way it concluded - it looks like we may have another one soon hopefully - could not put it down. I just can't get enough of Elizabeth and Darcy and love their steamy relationship. Lady Catherine never ceases to amaze me either.
5,Bass & Amp Package,"Purchased for grandson and he seemed to be very impressed. Unpacked everything right away, tuned and started playing."
4,Very nice,I am very impressed. For what it costs it's a great guitar. the only problem I have is something in the guitar is not grounded properly so there is this annoying buzz if your not touching any of the metal parts. But other that that everything works great.I would highly recommend this for a beginner.
4,Beginner Bass,"Amazon is always very fast with their service. Even with super saver shipping I received this product in less than a week, just in time for Christmas. Amazon is great! Now for the product itself, it's an alright buy for the price. The bass is good enough for a beginner and amplifier is a pretty decent for the price. The bag has no padding what-so-ever, but it's really the only big downfall. Overall, good enough for the price."
3,Good deal for the price,"My Silvertone Revolver(liquid black) package arrived today. I am an absolute beginer with no musical experience at all, so I was just happy to get a bass, strap,cord, flimsy gig bag,amp,picks, and a tuner. Why only three stars you ask? The instructional video, Learn and Master Gutair with Steve Krenz, didn't work on my computer. I then placed it in my living room DVD player and It wouldn't even follow the drawer into the player. On closer inspection, I discovered that the DVD was so warped that it was unreadable-it seriously looked like someone had put it through a dishwasher. My initial exitement turned to quick disappointment-The kit looks great and all, but I was chomping at the bit to start learning the basics, and the defective video really put a damper on my mood. Amazon was good enough to substite a different DVD which I hope to have within a few days. Wish I could say more, but due to the defective DVD, all I can do is look at it at this point."
4,koot,"everything works. nice guitar. not the color i expected, ordered cobalt blue, the giutar is a violet color. scratched up a little too. but i'm pleased."
3,Gee's Mom,"Great little guitar. Good sound. Seemed to be of good quality, until today. Just got it August 20th, now it won't work. Amplifier plays with another guitar, so it is not broken. One minute the guitar is playing and the next it is not. Was not playing it loud at the time it went out. Not sure what the problem is. Anyway, I hate that it has happened. Was very happy with the purchase for approximately 4 months & 2 weeks, I guess."
2,Don't purcase guitars online,"So after I waited 10 days for my 7 day shipping I open the box up and everything looks nice. The guitar was new and looks expensive. But the amp was smaller than I expected but worked fine. First thing wrong was the manufacturer didn't ship me the cable to connect the Bass to the Amp(Thank God my brother had a spare). After that I noticed the guitar buzzing a lot. I played around for 3 hours to find out what was causing the buzzing when I played and It turns out the neck of the guitar was bent out of shape. I try loosening the Truss rod but It didn't change a thing. After another 2 hours of work I took a good look at the neck and I realized it was warped back and twisted to the left. I took it to a guitar shop and they said the damage was irreversible. I was angry to say the least. HOWEVER amazon did a great job taking care of returning the product. Bottom line- don't buy guitars online, you never know what junk you might get."
4,nice learner,"Great starter for learning bass. Have been regular guitar playerfor many years, just starting to get interested in bass. Its very much a Fender clone. Good quality throughout."
3,"Bass decent, accesories are crap.","The tuner that came with the bass was broken, and one of the tuning machines was broken. The bass is good, it does rattle a bit but that is most likely the poor quality of the strings, overall it was a great value but the quality suffered."
2,Definitely see for yourself in person before you buy,"I was about to buy this but waw this same holder at bed bath & beyond.Poor welds, low quality. check it out in person before you buy."
1,Very cheaply made,"Please don't waste your money. They are very cheaply made. The first time I ordered one, the CD player didn't work. The second one has a problem with the turntable hitting the arm holder, although I can make it work by weighting down the right side of the arm holder. As others have noted, the sound's not that great either. All in all, I wish I'd bought something else."
1,Too much for nothing,"The book lists a series of financial theories without bringing any clear connection to operational risk. The tools and techniques presented can be seen in any other finance book. No examples are presented in general, making questionable the author's experience in the ""measurement of operational risk"" as stated in the title. This book will not raise your knowledge in the field."
5,super cute,"super cute outfit for my pomeranian, i think I got him a small. everybody commented and loved his costume. good buy!"
2,Eh...you get what you pay for,Costume is cute but feels VERY cheap. You get what you pay for. I don't think I'll ever use this costume on my dog. :-(
2,Sating pillowcases,"they are a lovely color, but I don't like the fact they aren't zippered. They slip off constantly."
3,Good Read For Teens,"I enjoyed the way the various authors were able to put a new twist on the old ""green man"" myths. While I have to agree with the reviewer who said the target audience seems to be mainly teen-aged girls, I must add that as a children's librarian, I found it refreshing to finally see a book that covers more then the usual teen fare: drugs, pregnancy, Mary Kate and Ashley.A worthy summer read!"
2,3rd in St. Clair trilogy does not measure up.,"Another reviewer described DON'T TEMPT ME as the weakest link in the St. Clair trilogy. I must concur. I thought FALLING FOR YOU about Aurora was pretty good and LEAD ME ON about Allison was okay, but this one (which is about Adrian and Jackie) just could not hold my interest. I ended up scanning through to get to the end. If you must have this book to complete the set, okay; but otherwise, don't bother."
3,good when it works,"first unit arrived defective -- the slot for the card I use (SD) was too large and would not read the card. the replacement unit (easy to obtain) worked fine, but had to be plugged into the computer, not a hub, for the reader to work, even though it has its own power supply. when it did finally work, the reader was very fast, much faster than the same USB 2.0 reader that is part of my all-in-one HP printer."
5,Outstanding entry in the Eighth Doctor Series.,"The last two books that I read in the EDA were both somewhat depressing. ""Reckless Engineering"" and ""The Crooked World"" both had dark shadows to them, feelings of hopelessness and despair. I picked this one up, hoping for a change of pace.Needless to say, I got what I was hoping for. ""Timeless"" is a great entry in the series. Humorous, a great story line/plot twists, good characters. It had it's own dark side to it, but it didn't stand out like it did in ""Reckless Engineering"". The book starts in several different story lines, each line emerging every fifty pages or so, concluding in a tense, dramatic climax. The Eighth Doctor is insightful and childish at the same time, just as Paul McGann was in the television movie. I would love to see this book come out as an episode some day!"
5,Seattle Music at its Finnest,"Upon hearing the first song the listener must keep listening, until it's done. This is what the album does. The lyrics are extremely hard to decypher, however upon reading them I was blown away. Crushcoat has a way of using very heavy words to fit a very light topic, and uses descriptive words that are not typical vernacular combining them with very normal words to give a meaning that stays with you. The band has a unique sound that captivates the listener. Definatley the best track is Nine Slider, with Snake the Charmer as a close second. I don't think there is another band who has a singer that sounds like this. He can go from being a dirty rock sound (Snake the Charmer) to a melodic thought provoking one (You and I) all around a great band, an ride from the begining. I would definately recomend this album to anyone who likes a good fresh experiance to Seatlle music."
3,I expected more,"Personally, I was disappointed. I'm very interested in the subject and am constantly seeking out new views and information. I was first intrigued by Beverly Jaegers' Beyond Palmistry but found the illustrations in that book to be inadequate. The illustrations in The Complete Guide are spectacular and detailed, and it makes an excellent companion to Ms. Jaegers' volumes, but I found its content biased and inadequate. It was over-simplified and the hand types were too pigeon-holed; palmistry and its history are dynamic, complex topics and can't be effectively covered in this trendy, nebulous table-top book. But it's not as bad as some of the others I've read. If nothing else, it should be an interesting introduction to the topic or a nice conversation piece for your coffee table."
2,the picture is wrong,"For some reason, Tyan diabled the Nforce audio on the board. The picture indicates an audio riser that just isn't there."
2,Bird Danger,This pan has Teflon on the outside bottem of the pan which is in direct contact with the gas flame. The flame will heat the Teflon above the safe level and give off toxic fumes that can harm birds.
3,Fun but One Dimensional,"This is made more like a display item than a toy. The song is catchy and addicting, but annoying after awhile! It is made pretty solid but doesn't withold to play very well. Our daughter lost interest in him pretty quickly and prefers Up Up Elmo over Pizza Elmo any day."
4,She loved it!,"My little girl wanted this for Christmas, she got it. Thank you Amazon for the price I paid. My kids loved this and played with it everyday for about a month, since then it has not been played with but he is still cute and he sits on the shelf waiting to be played with again. Hopefully!"
3,a slight dissapointment,"this book was slightly dissapointing. for starters, there were too few monster battles. another thing was the ending. they should not have left godzilla to be buried alive! however i did enoy this book"
2,Not worth the $..,"I was in a hurry when I chose this book, now I wish I'd spent a little more time flipping through it. Each section begins with dialogue between Matty and the people/dogs he is working with. That part is completely pointless, and not even entertaining to me. Finally I realized I could skip half of each chapter to get to the meat. Still though, there is pointless ad-libbing through the actually instructions! By skipping, it only took me 45 minutes to get through this book. If you can manage that, there is some usefull advice. However, for such a thick book, I was very surprised that it only covered basic commands. I am still a little confused about how to train my dog! Definately not worthy of ""The Ultimate Guide.."" title."
1,Uncle Mattie hogwash,"Uncle Mattie is a creep. I believe that dogs need training and different dogs need different things. I have 3 beautiful dachshunds. My older dachsie has back trouble and seisures. This is all part of what we think is bad breeding as the other 2 from different litters have zero health problems. My little girl is the sweetest thing in the world and so very well behaved. She would never bite and she is so patient and tolerant. Before I knew that she was having seisures at night, I discussed the problem with Uncle Mattie, (the creep) and he wanted me to fly my dog out to him so he could do some bruital training, (in his own words)with the dog. He stated that the dog was vicious and would get worse. What a creep. This dog would never hurt anyone or anything. What a putz! If I'd done what he asked I would have had to put the dog down. What a creep. OH yeah, and he said about 10 times, I should buy his book. IN HIS DREAMS!"
2,"Multiply by Jamie Lidell - ""A Little Bit More""","The CD is pretty good. I purchased the CD for one song, ""A Little Bit More"" which is the song that was being played in Target Commercials on TV. I looked to see if I could buy/download the individual song and I could not find it anywhere.I like about half of the CD. I really like ""A Little Bit More"". The rest I don't care for."
3,napoleon dynamite-ultimate edition dvd,"the dvd was shipped fine and looks to be brand new. It came to me on time and not damaged. while playing, it skips alot; I don't know if it is my dvd player or the dvd itself, but other dvds usually play just fine."
2,ehh it was alright,"i payed for express shipping and i got normal shipping. It skips a little in the middle but its not that bad. overall it was an alright purchase, but i might think about buying from someone else next time."
5,This is one of the GREATEST movies EVER!!!,"This is one of those movies that you either GET or you DON'T. If you get it you love it. If you don't get it, I strongly urge you to give it another chance in the future. This is one of the best feel good movies and absolutely HILARIOUS."
1,Terrible,"I saw this movie in the theatres. It's the only movie I've ever walked out on. It was boring, stupid, and the characters were pitiful."
2,"It is really not funny, at all.","I don't get it. Everyone I've talked to absolutely loved this movie, but good god, how? It was the most mind-numbing, sleep-inducing movie I have ever sat through. The characters were annoying and bland to say the least. To each his own perhaps, or maybe I just don't understand the humor."
1,"Overhyped, and fortunate to receive one star","The movie while having many strongpoints lost its appeal the minute someone told me about it. Though I do fancy films that have little or no points, and bear irrelevant characteristics to other films, I feel like my time has been wasted. I had the distinct pleasure of going over to a frinds house and having some leisure party time when the clan of visitors in the apartment desided to pop in Napolean Dynamite. My gut instinct was to give it a chance to maybe have a chance of liking it. Nay, it didnt happen. It seems that this movie is more or less mellancholy trying to be funny. The acting is good (pariculary napoleans g'd out brother and push-over uncle) but its so dull. Perhaps the only funny part is when naploean dances for his school to elect pedro but otherwise it falls flat on its face. I can understand how some people could connect with this flick but it's certainly not forme."
1,Why Can't I Give 0 Stars?!,"You can only have one of two reactions to this film: love or loathing.Some people love this film on the basis of its ""dead-pan"" humor. Those of us with sense realize that this film lacks any humor at all. What the former type of viewer has mistaken for humor is a condescending hatred of its own characters. People who like this film just enjoy laughing at nerds. It's actually that simple.There's no plot. The characters, pathetic as they begin, never develop. The so-called jokes are so dry that one feels the sensation of dying in the desert as the writers senselessly destroy the spirits of their own characters. Even the dancing climax that audiences seem to adore really just comes across as another opportunity to watch the nerd suck at life.""Napoleon Dynamite"" should be wiped from the face of the Earth in the name of good film."
1,Total Garbage,"A comedy is supposed to make you laugh, or so I am told. If that is the case then why is this movie being called by so many as one of the funniest movies in years. The whole time I watched it I maybe chuckled once, and even that was probably forced. This movie is dull, stupid, and ultimatly pointless.The story here is that Napoleon is a high school student who seemingly gets no respect. He makes friends with a hispanic student who transfers in and a girl who one day tried to sell him crap. After his guardian gets injured in a ATV accident his Uncle moves in to care for them, and all he can think about is a get rich quick scheme. The movie drags along at an unbearably slow pace and ultimatly is not funny.I am told it gets better with repeat viewings but the question is, if the movie sucks to begin with, why watch it again. That's like saying ""I shot myself in the foot, but I don't remember what it felt like so lets do it again.""Avoid, end of story. Worst comedy in years."
3,not quite sure what to make of it,"There's only three ways you can feel about this movie once you've watched the WHOLE thing. You can feel that you just saw an incredible comedy, a waste of an hour and a half or that you just don't know how to feel about it. I don't know how to feel about it. Whether it's a parody of nerds or a tribute to them. Whether its trying to be an absurd comedy or trying to add in some dry humor. Some people love the film and some hate it. One thing that can be agreed by both lovers and haters it is intended to not be adventurous. It is pretty much real life captured on film. Whether you think that to be funny or bland is your decision."
1,A comedy with no humour.,"This is the worst film I have seen in a long time and has nothing to recommend it. Pretentious & filled with contempt for it's 'characters' it invites the viewer to mock those it deems beneath them. People treat Napoleon with indifference or hatred, which is the only option he really gives them. Put me in the hate camp.For a better treatment of the same issues see 'Welcome to the Dollhouse"""
1,It Was The Stupidest Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"he is such an idiot! and the dance in the end is also pretty wierd to. like if you were a guy like him i don't think a hot girl like whats her face would say yes. were are N-a-p-o-l-e-o-n's parents.napleon does not look at people when he talks to them. like unclerico is sell pot and breast impants like what idiot would do that???? and kip thinks he will become a cage fighter. he will die in fight agenst a 6 year old before he could get in to cage fighter. and that line"" will you give a rid into town"" why doesn't he just rollerbled in to town i think he would get thear faster!?!?!?!? and he waiting for his uncle before he goes to prom or dance he starts running that is the dumbest thing to do even though he does a lot of dumbe stuff!! that's all!!!!"
5,A flippin' sweet special edition,"I am so thrilled with this movie, and with the speed with which it was delivered. This was a gift for my husband's birthday, so I asked to have it rush shipped. It arrived right on time, and it is super fun and perfect."
4,Thought I'd Hate It.,"I was rather ""Out of the loop"" for the duration of Napoleon-Mania . I was serving as a missionary for my church, at which time I didn't watch any TV or movies or even listen to much music. I heard a little bit about Napoleon Dynamite, and alot of people were quoting it(""IDIOTS""). All I saw was a formula for disaster. Everyone said there was no plot and that there were alot of inside jokes. All of the 10-15 yr old crowd seemed highly entertained while most of their parents did not. So when I got home (which was after the lunacy), I hesitated, even rejected invitations to watch it. Then one day, at Blockbuster, my dad convinced me to watch it. Honestly, I loved it. I laughed for days. That's all that was really important to me."
1,Napoleon DONOTWATCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The worst 1 hour and 29 minutes of my life. Every second had me screaming for mercy. It boggles the mind how they could disrespect a noble organization like the FFA. They practically defiled the FFA jacket. And I do NUT think ugly people should be in movies. Don't watch.P.S. Watch the best movie EVER White Chicks.
1,Worst Movie of the Year,"I had very high expectations for Napoleon Dynamite, but when I walked into that movie theater I knew I should have never went. The movie had no plot, the characters were not likable (rather irritating in fact), and the humor was many times very stupid. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but suggest that you stay as far away as possible from this terrible film, in my opinion the worst of this year, and BEWARE!"
1,Napleon dymaite,This film is a racist film which shows people of mexican decent as dumb and stupid not all people who are mexican are stupid or dumb. this film is a dumb film. if you want a good indie film about a nerd watch welcome to the doll hose.
1,There is no plot to this stupid movie,Most movies are about somethig but this one is about nothing. It is about a guys every day life but he has probloms like he still wears pampers or something likke that. I would have to say that the lizzie mcugire movie is like 10 times better and I hate that movie. At least that movie has a plot. They never get to the elections till about 75% of the movie is over. Then napolean does a stupid dance and the same with summer. the popular people are not like the girls in regular movies they never make fun of napolean. And the fact that it took 22 days to shoot was stupid. It should have taken much much shorte like 3 hours because it is about a geeky kids life so he shold be aloud to say whatever he wants. I wish I could rate it 0 stars but oh well. I probaly perfectky described the plot of the movie. If you like movies with no plot you should probaly get this movie.
1,over rated,"Everthing about this movie was bad. The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor. The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975. How much did it cost them to film this movie? 50 bucks? The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with."
1,What is this,"This was an hour and a half of pure torture. I saw little semblance of a plot, very, very little comedy and bad acting all around. I didnt like this movie from the very beginning- the food on the plates being passed in and out. This makes no sense, i hate this movie and all those who ""love"" it who proabably want to cut out my eyeballs right now."
1,I am baffled...,"People have told me that you have to see this movie twice to really like it and that you should see it with other people who like it. I've done both a few times and I still dislike this movie. It is dull, slow paced, and pointless. There are moments that are funny, but they aren't really funny, worth maybe a ""ha"", but no more than ""haha"", if that makes sense. I guess I can see that some people would find this type of movie entertaining, but personally, it left me wondering why I had wasted my time on it."
1,IDIOTS!!!!!,"Just tell me why peoples! Why do you guys LOVE this movie? First off, I saw it to see if it's actually funny, which it wasn't! Then I saw it to see as an independent filmaker, but I kind of felt it, but not really. If you haven't seen this movie, (well that's prety weird becuase the whole world has probably seen it by now), don't watch it."
3,I've had better!,"This movie has definitely developed a cult following. My friends recommended that I see it when it was released in theaters, but I never got around to it. They described it as ""an awkward movie about awkward people being awkward."" Basically, I didn't really get it. I kind of understand how other people could think it was the Funniest Movie of All Time, but I'm not one of those people. This movie is by far more fun to quote than it is to watch. It's hilarious out-of-context, but not worth sitting down for an hour and a half to watch. When my dad saw it, he said it was like watching your kids in the school play: cute, but not really entertaining. And I would have to agree. It's funny, but not hilarious. It's good for about 20 minutes, not 90."
1,TERRIBLE AND STUPID!!,"LOVE IT OR HATE IT?? IN MY CASE: HATE IT!! ONE HOUR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK, NOT TO MENTION THE $20."
1,Not even Worth Finishing,"My brother bought me Napoleon Dynamite for Christmas. Both he and I were excited because of all the hype and the commercials were hilarious...too bad we didn't know that they showed all the good material in the movie in a one minute movie trailer. I turned the movie off after thirty minutes because I couldn't find a reason to finish it. If you get hold of this movie, I suggest you just fastforward to the part where Napoleon is dancing because that is the only thing worthwhile."
5,Funny from start to finish!,The whole family enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite...an endearing and unique cast of characters. We laughed from the first scene and were touched by how the story turned out in the end...sweet :)
5,Hilarious and out of the box zany,"Alll the characters in this movie are memorable not just Napoleon, a 20th century Charlie Brown. The plot moves along at a leisurely pace with lots of detours that are poignant, sharp and funny. The ending is a triumph,"
1,Love comedies...,...but this was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Stupid stupid stupid! Do not waste your money.
3,Sweet Movie,"Napoleon Dynamite is one weird film. You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times and completely bored at others. There is no real plot to the film other than Napoleon's (Jon Heder) efforts to get his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) elected class president. Napoleon lives with grandmother and his effeminate brother Kip (Aaron Ruell). After grandma is hurt riding in the dunes, Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to watch after the boys even though Kip is 32. While Napoleon is an outcast with no friends, Uncle Rico is the saddest character in the film. He is desperately trying to recapture his glory days and even goes so far to buy a time machine that will take him back to 1982. What saves this film from being a total bore is the immensely likable cast. Mr. Heder is great in the title and everyone else makes their characters quirky but fun."
4,GOOD MOVIE!!! YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE!! IT HAS A SLOW BEGINNING BUT OVER TIME YOU GROW TO LOVE IT!! THE JOKES ARE FUNNY BUT ANYONE UNDER 21 NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! IT IS WHAT TEENS EVERYWHERE ARE TALKING ABOUT (AND I SHOULD KNOW)!! DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS!! OH AND FYI...IF YOU ARE OVER 30 YOU WILL PROBABLY HATE THIS FILM!!PS: VOTE FOR PEDRO.....IDIOT!!
4,Napoleon is funny,"I saw this movie based on the hype that I had heard from friends, radio, and TV. Well I was plesently surprised with the wackyness that is Napoleon Dynamite. This kid makes you want to beat him up and feel sorry for him at the same time. Some of the quotes and pure ""retardism"" is truly funny stuff. I mean this kid has a pet llama that spits goop all over him when he goes to feed it!! The brother and uncle seal the deal on this classic comedy. If you like offbeat comedies such as the Royal Tennenbaums or Cable Guy I think that you will treasure this movie as I have."
3,Napoleon Dynamite,"This was an okay movie. The acting was great! I think the actors played their parts well. But the filming was choppy, and looked more like pieces of Napoleon's life mixed together instead of a movie where all of the parts blend into one big story. The humor was also more memorable humor, and not the laugh-out-loud kind. I actually find myself enjoying repeating Napoleon's lines more than watching the movie. But the movie was unique, and there were a lot of characters involved, so things were at least decently interesting. Overall, I recommend this to people who are looking for a different kind of humor than what is in the usual comedy movies. My cousin also says that the movie is one of those that gets better every time you watch it...so who knows? Maybe if I watched it a couple more times, I would like it better."
5,Sweet natured film,I've seen this movie three times and my kids have seen it 5 times each. We all love it because it is very funny and sweet. Jon Heder is perfect as Napoleon and his friends and family are priceless. Even the high school queen bees and jocks aren't all that mean. Everyone is just human and most of them will remind you at least a little of someone you went to high school with. Endlessly quotable and a lot of fun!
1,REALLY stinky...,"This movie is perhaps the worst I've ever seen.I do not understand what people see in it. It's justplain stupid, with no point."
1,Simply one of the worst movies made,"My friends raved to me about a movie they had seen over the weekend, it was ""hilarious"", this movie was Napoleon Dynamite. I went to Amazon.com to check the sales rank and reviews to discover there were few bad reviews so I thought I would give it a shot. The next weekend I watched the movie with a friend we both sat quietly watching the plotless film. It looked as if it had potential in the beginning, so we waited and waited for the plot to develop, only to discover there wasn't one. There is a reason the character Napoleon Dynamite doesn't get recognized in every day life because they are compulsive liars to make their boring lives seem worthwhile. This movie is a complete waste of time and I have no idea why so many people have actually purchased it. Save your money."
5,sometimes you don't need a plot,I thought this movie was great! Where is it written that every movie needs a plot? Napoleon Dynamite is just what the doctor ordered when you want to sit and watch something that you don't have to pay close attention to. I look forward to seeing how Kip's wedding turns out. :>)
2,Pointless...,This movie is nearly plotless. And it's definantly a waste of time. There were two or three moments...but it's nothing to watch again.
2,Tedious,"Probably the real review is ""They didn't make it for me"" but I'm pretty sure that a lot of folks who enjoy the odd little film now and then might be tempted to get this one and be disappointed.It struck me as a movie that Woody Allen might have done as a young man if he had all his current angst and issues then, and hadn't started on therapy yet. I'm sure that the ""human condition"" story of Sad Sack Napoleon will be of interest to some, but not to many. Certainly not to me.It's a lot like listening to someone else's therapy session about a particularly awkward adolescence. 2 stars because it's well done for what it is."
2,"Sorry, I missed it too","Obviously this is a movie you either get or don't. I don't.I saw it with a group of people who were already into it, Pedro t-shirts and everything. I was all setup to enjoy it, but nothing. I may have chuckled twice. There were a few funny bits, but for the most part I didn't laugh at the places apparently I was supposed to.The odd thing is that . . . neither were they! I've seen ""Holy Grail"" (for example) about a thousand times, and I still bust a gut. Don't you laugh when Marty Feldman sticks his head out the door in ""Young Frankenstein"" and says . . . ""Blucher!"". Yet, this Pedro crowd couldn't even muster a titter at the tater tots scene, or much else for that matter. They just kind of mechanically ticked off the bits for me, as if I was suppose to understand how great they were.This is a film that seems to have been deliberately made to be a cult film, and manufactured pop culture doesn't work in the long run."
2,Not Worth It,"After many students have inquired, I decided to watch Napoleon Dynamite.I must say, I found this movie to be rather pointless. I didn't necessarily find it stupid, but I didn't like it.Many of my students liked it, but I think it is because they were laughing at Napoleon because he was, what we commonly call, a loser. I just kind of found it sad that Napoleon was so picked on. I have become increasingly sensitive to that in my old age.I just see a lot of kids like Napoleon, I think most of us have been Napoleon, and it is sad. Maybe that's the point? That we shouldn't pick on people. I just wish students would get that too."
1,Worst Comedy Ever Made,"...and I say that as someone who has actually written bad comedy for a living. There is an art to deadpan, but this wasn't that. It felt sado-masochistic to me. Like I would be tortured by a bad film until I sadistically started laughing at the brain dead, class ""retard"". Bleh.There are a lot of funny movies out there, this isn't one of them. Bleh again. Bleh, bleh."
1,"If there was a Blockbuster in heck,it would have this movie","This movie is so bad it's almost pure evil.Everyone at my school thinks it's hilarious,they say the quotes and wear the stupid shirt.Why? Please someone tell me why? It is so boring that I felt like taking a nap in only about 10 minutes into it.Napoleon is the world's biggest loser.If you met him on the street he would say something like 'hey you got a red backpack lucky gosh hhuuhuhuhuhhu i like ligers gosh!!!' and you would want to stab him many times with a knife.Oh yeah,and where's the humour? How is saying 'gosh','freakin idiot',and 'hey can i have some tots' so hilarious? If people said that before this movie came out then THEY would be stabbed many times with a knife for talking like a moron.And what's with that one girl's hair? Bad movie,bad bad bad movie,don't listen to people when they say it's hilarious because it's boring and you'd feel like you'd rather be kicked in the face with steel boots then watch it."
4,"Quirky, yet very familiar","This is a nice twist on the classic underdog/nerd story.Napoleon is trapped in an odd late 80's/90's world (or is it modern and they just are all in a time warp) where he does not fit. His family is just as odd (if not odder) than he is and even the popular people at school are a bit off.This movie is character driven with great lines you will find yourself repeating but you have to have a particular sense of humor, I think, to enojoy this movie.If you like Wes Anderson's movies you will most definitely enjoy this flick. It is a great rental."
2,Just not very good.,"This is the type of movie I should like, but I don't. Maybe it's because I'm still in high school where everybody has no brain at all. This is a type of movie all the popular kids should hate. But they don't. They all say flippin' and God!!! and it gets really annoying. I've seen it 2 times, and I just don't like it. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see what all the hype was about (there should be none). I'm not going to doubt that it was original. Want to see a funnier movie? See Super Troopers, Anything Monty Python ever did, Dumb and Dumber, and anything Mystery Science Theater 3000 did."
5,What Fun!!,"Edward Lear's wonderful nonsense poem and Jan Brett's gorgeous illustrations combine to make this my favorite-of-all-time children's book. I've bought copies for grandchildren and sent one to cheer up a friend, an artist, who'd broken her wrist. I finally bought my own copy. My fantasy would be to paste its pages on the walls of a sunny attic reading room for my grandchildren.The Owl and the Pussycat"
4,Great take on a classic poem,"I remembered this poem from when I was little, and always found it a charming and whimsical story. I chose the book for my two year specifically because it did have such wonderful artwork. It does not disappoint. I love the tropical theme chosen for the story, as does my daughter, who is fascinated by all fish, turtles, and aquatic life right now (hello, Nemo?). It's wonderful to share a poem and story that I so enjoyed when I was young with my daughter."
5,Good book for webwork developers,"Really good book for webwork developers. Suggest to have next edition to reflect new changes,updates, and lesson learn(from previous edition) in webwork."
2,Inferior Materials,"Bought the slicer and extra wires, but never got to use the extra wires because the plastic thumb wheel broke after about a year."
2,Not so great...,"Generally, I love OXO. Huge fan. However, the designers of this cheese slicer clearly don't understand the forces applied to the wire during cheese cutting. If they did, they never would have made the tensioning nut and the wire connection point out of plastic. Mine is stripped now, and I am searching for yet another cheese slicer. Stay away from this product unless you plan to treat it as disposable."
4,Great Quality - Not adjustable,"As with all Oxo products, this cheese slicer is very well made. The only thing I wish it had is an adjustable slicing size. This comes with two additional wires which are very quick and easy to install."
1,Worst cheese slicer ever,"I say that because it is not adjustable. Even though they say you can adjust it by positioning your wrist, I don't find that to be true. The slices are waaaay too thick. Also, if you try to cut a hard cheese without letting it soften at room temp you end up having to use a lot of pressure which slams your hand down and pinches your fingers if you're not careful. I hate this slicer. Don't buy it - just don't do it unless you like ultra-fat cheese slices."
1,Interesting design but badly flawed - I second that!,"See ""Interesting design but badly flawed"" review. I had the exact same experience of having not one but two of these items plastic tension wheals break after limited use. Oddly, they supply the item with 2 replacement wires, but these wires don't break before the wheel fails, so you'll never need them. The slicer does, however, work very well until failure."
2,curb feelers,"thy are not as sturdy as I thought they should be, the mounting to the fender ""U"" bracket is to thin and can bend easy"
2,A Real Snorer,"Many of Thomas Cooks novels are beautifully written and include captivating and fully drawn characters. Unfortunately, Cook seems capable of writing only one kind of book--a story told in flashbacks. His books never proceed in a linear fashion. Read one or two of his books and you've basically read them all.It's a shame that Cook doesn't deviate from his flashback formula because he is truly an excellent writer.In addition to the formulaic plot device, *Places in the Dark* also suffers from cardboard characters whose motives and lives are never fully examined."
5,Tons of fun!,"This is my first venture into the guitar hero series, but this game totally rocks, and is scarily addictive. Tons of fun! I've had no issues with the controller, but do wish it had been implemented with Bluetooth rather than the USB dongle. I also wish they'd patch the game to make the controller compatible with the older guitar hero games."
2,Rushed to release.....?,"I would have given this a 5 star rating, but the POS Kramer guitar I got is broke! The whammy bar does not work at all! Everything else is fine. I'm reading about how the 360 is having problems with their guitars too, sounds like poor manufacturing. My only other problem is the Devil Went Down to Georgia. Why cant I just play the song? I beat the game on Medium, and just want to play the song. Not battle the devil, just play the song! Am I missing something here? Why do they put a song in the game that you cant JUST PLAY? Hopefully I can get my guitar replace with out too much hassle, 'cause it is the sweetest *Official* guitar they make."
5,Fun for all!,"I am not much of a gamer, but my boyfriend is and we have a PS2. We were looking for a fun game that we could play together and this is perfect! I especially like that we can play at the same time, but on different levels. It's a fun game for everyone, gamer or not!"
4,Guitar Hero III wireless bundle,"I have to say that I'm disappointed in the guitar. It seems to be delayed, meaning I have to hit the frets just before the screen tells me to or I miss. Very frustrating. I've played with other guitars and have not had this problem.The game itself is very fun."
4,"Awesome Game, NO WIRES","I'm not sure why some people were having trouble with the wireless guitar. I hooked mine up and jumped right in. The guitar connected immediately, and I have had no lag problems at all. I would definetly reccomend this to others. The wireless factor is a major bonus for me, and the fact that I didn't have any problems setting it up makes it a no brainer for beginners."
5,These are yummy!,These are some of the best chocolates I've had for a lot less then other chocolate brands. I still really like godiva chocolates and will continue to get them but these are good for when you can't afford the other ones. They taste almost the same. I highly recommend them!
2,Tascam DP-01,"I started 42 years ago recording. Working my way up to my own Tascam 8 Track & 3216 board with a full blown Studio with 3 PB64 patch bays. Yep! I had more bell and whistles than most 24 track studios. Tascam has gotten a lot of my money over the years.OK, so I inherit this DP-01, My gosh it took me 20 minutes to figure out how to open the CD tray. I've read lots of books on home recording starting with Craig Anderton Home Recording. The Tascam DP-01 Instruction manual does not translate well. Yea, there is a big learning curve on digital recording when you are coming from analog.But, If Tascam wants anymore of my money they need to put out step by step manuals with lots of pictures or at least get me for another 49.95 for a how to DVD . The problem is now my DP-01 which still smells new, is getting old and dated (What's Next?). I'm left to read and re-read a badly written manual. Gaw'd what a headache."
2,Is it worth buying?,"I think it isn't worth buying. It's nothing like the dub or the original version. And the Serena in this book just doesn't seem like the Serena or Usagi(original version) you would see on the anime show. I just couldn't really imagine her liking things like Backstreet boys or saying, ""Oh my God!"" a lot. She's not like the Serena(Usagi) I have always known. Plus, there are parts that just go on forever and parts that just weren't in the show. In my opinion, I just don't think these books are really that great.~Kometsu-chan"
4,Big Help,"My daughter has very fine, long hair that is constantly falling out of pony-tails, head bands and clips; so I borrowed this book from our library in a desperate effort to find some way to let her keep the long hair, but out of her face. It was so good, that we decided that we had to have it!Since I already have a basic understanding of how to braid I was able to follow the directions without difficulty. The step-by-step illustrations were a big help, too. As were the color pictures of what the finished style should look like.Some of the styles require a lot more hair than others, and it would have been nice to have had some indication of that before starting."
1,Not what I expected,"I was very hopeful that the leash would be reflective but I have yet to prove it. We take many walks at night on a dark road so were looking for something that didn't ""jangle"" from the dog's collar so we opted for a leash. This isn't the item we hoped for. Leash is lightweight and durable though."
5,Great Product,This has been a fantastic product and Accessory Genie is a fabulous company to do business with. My kids constantly twist their laptop cords so I've had to replace this several times. Every shopping experience with this company has been great.
1,A bad B Horror flick,"I really wanted to like this movie when I started to watch it. It turned out that I really didn't like this movie at all. The story was presented in such a bad way that it was very unbelievable. A ranch hand being an ex-priest, the other ranch hand always carring a gun to get his way, the father being an overly jealous husband and father, the non-emotional mother of Isabelle and finally a farm vet that is acting as a medical doctor of the possessed Isabelle. The acting was very poor except for Jacob the ranch hand and for Isabelle the main actress. I understand that the movie was based on a true story, and with respect to the people that were orginally involved, don't waste your money on renting it or purchasing it."
1,COHAYES-DON'T BOTHER,THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE EVER I HAVE OVER 200 DVD'S NEVER SOLD ONE.GAVE THIS AWAY FOR FREE(EXORCISM YEAH RIGHT)
2,not so good,"i had another expectation from this movie...believe me, save you money, stay away from this one"
3,More oddities,"Made in AUT in 2000, Serial# SJPCD-051, Playing Time 131:07Disc 1 (76:19) features a collection of non-album tracks, a few of which have appeared as bonus tracks on the first release of ""Glory Road"" on CD. Of greater interest on this disc are the live renditions, especially ""Born To Kill"" and ""No Laughing In Heaven"".Disc 2 (54:48) is added as a bonus on the first 5000 copies, and includes all the material originally released on the bonus disc from the UK vinyl pressing of the ""Glory Road"" album (entitled ""For Gillan Fans Only""), including the humorous interludes between the musical tracks. As a hidden bonus on the last track, another musical number I've never heard before, possibly entitled ""H-Bomb"".The liner notes, written by John McCoy, unfortunately only cover the material on disc 1.It's a good complement to the other 2 ""Gillan Tapes"" album, but still remains ""For Gillan Fans Only"""
3,Very cute and a few issues,"These were really cute but they shed like crazy and the nails are just hot glued to the fabric so they fell off. I think we could have glued them back on, but my daughter cut the finger tips off so she could wear them to work and use a keyboard."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"When I started to play this game it had terrible graphics and the game commands are very complicated. I am glad that my friend opened it before I did, because I am returning it right now! Its horrible!"
2,Too small!,"The selection of colors is great and much more reasonable then buying a three-piece crib set, however, I was disappointed in how small this really is! I have a standard size crib and I really had to pull the side to be able to tie them. The height is also lower then I thought...the previous bumper I had was at least 2 1/2 inches higher than this one!"
3,Too long,"A bumper's a bumper, right? Nice and cushiony, yes. But this bumper is too long for the perimeter of our portable crib...namely the white steel Cosco one. Because it's too long, the ties don't match up with the corners; they're all over the place. This bumper must be meant for the wooden portable crib I've seen."
1,Burning sensation? Yes. Mood killer? Absolutely!,"Don't waste your money.As the other reviewer noted, it burns.Both ladies complained of burning and it flat out killed the mood.Thank goodness not all toys have this effect.If there was a way to give zero stars, I would do that.Like pouring alcohol on a paper cut."
3,Be fair now,"The artwork was superfluous-she looked better in a schoolgirl outfit on ""What a Life!"" Still, the raspy tone she gives of ""Bless My Soul"" is something worth raising a fist to, and the horn solo on the loud, funky ""Lay your Body Down"" is as good as anything by the Stones. Yeah, there's enough pointless sap here, but on the rockers these guys are animals. A diverse album that is unfairly slammed as a one hit wonder-the music has tang, Cristina has a real life personality that carries the album through the dull stuff. No, I don't ""Touch Myself"" when I hear that song-it's good to excercise (stylishly) to when you're in the mood to embarass the more stuck-up acquaintances. No, this is not a 5 star ablum as you'll find at least one loon say about any album this side of ELO II, but it FEELS good, at least (Note to Don Henley). P.S keep it in the bedroom"
5,"Very nice book, my English has improved so much.",I must say this book was very trans-formative for me. I came here not knowing a lick of English. But after just 3 pages I feel quite at home in The Bard's tongue.
3,good for esl,good tool for esl students. it's mostly pictures of scenarios to teach about things like conversations and things in context. prefer using the picture dictionary.
4,This text was well written and useful in college Anatomy,"Martini takes a very difficult subject and puts it into terms that the average student can comprehend. A must for anyone taking Anatomy and Physiology in college or Medical School. This is a text that you will use over and over again, unlike other texts that are bought and never opened."
2,did not care for this pack n play,My daughter liked to play in it but it is incrediably difficult to put up you really have to pull hard to get the sides to lock once they are up there is no problem if you were going to leave this up I would highly recomend it but I bought it to travel and I really do not like it I am winded once if finlly get the thing up
3,What should be expected,"For a new company this is a great way to start out by never over rating an item for sale. I can say I am happy with my purchase,since it was in better condition than what I percieved."
1,One of the worst strategy guides I've ever seen,"After recently finishing this game I can say this was a poorly conceived strategy guide.There are no maps included,the locations of the items earned in battles is incomplete(kaiser helm,blessed habit and helm etc).The guide also fails to point out that boss item drops aren't guaranteed.Mainly,the ending is given away at the end of the guide.A certain amount of spoilers are expected in most guides,but giving away the ending?Come on!!!In conclusion,use the internet to search for walkthroughs for xenogears.There's more information on the web than in this guide."
3,Wire Cage clips,"I bought these to go with the hardware cloth fencing and wound up not using them. Didn't need them for fencing, used u shaped staples."
3,Did not work for me,"Unfortunatelly, this book didn't work for me--I thought it was too contemporary of Regency story, and the story dragged unnecessarily long. Although, the writing was decent, but the story was un-natural. It was not an engrossing read for me."
5,Terrific empirically supported self-help text,"This is the best treatment manual I've seen for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It presents a scientifically sound cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol in user-friendly language. Individuals with GAD can either work through it on their own or with a therapist. The Therapist Manual is excellent, too; I highly recommend both."
1,Garbage,"This book was absolutely terrible. I purchased it with high hopes, but instead I threw it away. I couldn't have the heart to sell it used to someone else, because one person should only get burned buying this book."
5,Weird yet Trippy Movie!,"It's a movie I should be watching to do a Humanities project on. It goes through time staring at different scenes and crazy music,it has no real point. It's a perfect movie if your not in your right mind and your into that sort of thing.=)"
1,Not up to the mark,"After Baraka, this is a real disappointment. It looks as if it were assembled from what was cut from Baraka. Buy Baraka and be happy."
2,It's ok,Chronos is alright some of the scenes are nice but if I were you i'd save my money and buy somthing else.
1,Chronos,I wasn't able to review this DVD because I couldn't get it to play in my DVD player. Even the replacement DVD didn't work. Product seems to be defective....at least in my player. Obviously other people have had the same problem with this particular DVD judging from the tags & comments.
1,DVD is a disgrace to IMAX!,"IMAX is the final word when it comes to image quality - so maybe I was expecting too much when I bought this DVD.It just looks awful on my 9 ft screen. Image is SO soft, I first thought there was something wrong with my Video Projector! The colors are also faded and washed out, and edge artifacts are also visible.I'm sending this back. I popped in my ""5th Element"" DVD, just to get a dose of vibrant colors and sharp detail again!Simitar is trying to pass off an awful product to consumers,NOTE to other 16x9 widescreen system owners: this DVD is 1.33 aspect ration (like IMAX), so you'll have black bars on the left & right of the image."
4,close but no cigar,"After finding this film grouped with baraka and the qatsi series i had to have it. While i cannot bring myself to knock on any ron fricke film, at the end of the film's 40 minutes i found myself expecting more. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but nevertheless i was not as impressed by this effort as i have been by the other films of this style. That said, the vatican shots are fabulous and thoughly breathtaking to watch."
5,A visual and aural treat!,"Originally released as an IMAX film in the mid-80s, Chronos on DVD unfortunately can not match the power of the IMAX experience. But really; what TV can compete with a 5-story-high screen? I saw the film three times in IMAX and each time I saw something new and amazing. I couldn't wait to get this film on DVD. Any shortcomings the Chronos DVD has are related to the size and clarity of the image as displayed on a television, not the film's content. The images of earthly constructions both natural and man-made are drop-dead-gorgeous, and the music -- a nonstop electronic instrumental score -- is mesmerizing. At roughly 45 minutes in length, you'll not want it to end. The disc has a spare and clunky interface and no special features, but who cares? Chronos is a wonder that I find myself watching again and again."
4,"Very Good, but.......","I have both editions and this edition is a remarkable improvement. However, the author who has vast experience in marine geology, decided to take up precious space in an early chapter on this topic since, according to him, we live on a planet covered by water. I think instead 15-20 pages introducing geologic maps and elementary structure(especially after his introductory chapter on the history of US geological surveying) would serve the reader far better--who probably will have little opportunity to particpate in 'field' marine geology.Maley lists standard field geology books in the reference section (Compton, etc), but field geology for the beginner/student involves understanding field maps, not just photos, as good as these pics are. A few pages covering geologic maps makes sense for a field geology book with over 700 pages."
2,"Not the ""Best of""",This album contains a lot of clunkers. Many of these tracks were not originally released and it's easy to see why. Don't waste your money on this CD.
2,Not worth the money,"Like another reviewer, I am disappointed in this product. The loofah pads and attachments pop off when you rub your foot on them (per the instructions), which kind of defeats the purpose. If I wanted to scrub my feet by hand, I'd use a hand-held loofah. The ""vibrations"" and ""heat"" are a joke. I put very warm water in it and it was cold within minutes and the vibration did nothing to massage my feet. There are some round massager things in the bottom, but again, if I wanted to massage my feet by hand, I would have done it instead of buying a foot spa. I'll be returning this product. Does not meet my expectations at all."
1,Look somewhere else.........,It is shallow and the water splashes all over. The heat does not work....It is only 85 watts so little power for heat. The massage is not powerful. Don't waste your time nor money..........look to other products.Returned for a refund.
2,disappointed,"It was purchased in hopes of relieving heel pain. The unit isn't deep enough to do any good. Also the ""massage pods"" hurt."
1,Absolutely useless,"They have a lot of nerve, selling this as a unit with heat. It was a gift, and I feel bad that my loved one wasted good money on this plastic piece of junk. Meanwhile, my feet hurt."
4,gr8 product,a little loud but there is alot going on first massager bubbles and water jet. this product makes my feet feel a lot better
3,This is my first air bush so I have nothing to compair it to,"I found it challenging to get an even and consistent spray but that may have been my inexperience with setting proper air pressure and thinning the paint. As a first gun, it has been good to practice with and allowed my son to win first place with his pine wood derby car!!!"
3,For a laugh,We saw this on TV years ago and it made us literally laugh out loud. When we found it on Amzaon....couldn't resist buying it.
2,Not too enlightening,"Most of these recipes will be quite familiar, especially if you are from ""fly-over country."" The jello salads, cheesy (""funeral"") potatoes, casseroles etc. are staples at any church carry-in dinner."
2,"Boggy Creek 2, or Put a Shirt on that Boy!","You can't blame Charles Pierce for wanting to go back to that Boggy Creek well again after the first movie, but this time he pulls up a bucket full of fetid water. This movie is all sorts of wrong! From casting himself in the role of ""Doc"" to putting his own son in a large supporting role, sans shirt for a majority of the running time, Pierce misfires on almost every level. The flashback stories almost brought back the flavor of the original Boggy Creek (the outhouse scene alone is a hoot), but then he offsets that with the hilarious ""mad dog!"" scene. By the time Old Man Crenshaw shows up, the wheels totally fly off this shaky cart and promptly bursts into flames! Being a bigfoot sub-genre fanatic, I feel justified buying this title, but do not see spinning the DVD as often as the far superior The Legend of Boggy Creek. Where's Travis Crabtree when you really need him?!"
5,lenny's best,"get this if you want lenny's best. he has never done a finer song than the oepning track on this album, ""fields of joy."" and of course, this also features the infectious ""it ain't over."" mama said is a rocker. they all rock. this cd is one of the best front to back you'll ever find. the ecclectic lenny."
5,LOCO POR VOS,"Come on, cut the crap, this cd is a master piece. in my opinion this is the best of all five cd Kravtiz made. SM-Argentina"
2,"Love Billy, but the book...?","I love Billy Crystal and would have enjoyed seeing ""700 Sundays"" on Broadway, but the book wasn't what I expected. There a few deep chuckles in the first quarter of the book, but the book is not a comedy; it is a quick narrative of his life. It was a ""Cliff Notes"" version of a full autobiography. Given the title, I expected to hear more about his father and the 700 Sundays he spent with him. Instead you get a glimpse of his numerous relatives and his life with them.Unlike other reviewers, I felt that I needed to hear Billy telling the story himself. The book misses his on stage delivery.It isn't a long book to read or an expensive investment. If you want to know some interesting details about Billy Crystal's life (like the fact that he saw his first movie sitting on Billy Holiday's lap), then buy it."
5,Lanny's first,"Originally recorded for Palo Alto in 1981, this was Lanny's first album. It's obvious these guys showed up in the studio ready and eager to play. Lanny is in superb form. There's hardly a better version of KOKO out there than the one found here, and the title track is a wonderful tune that has Don Rader added on flugelhorn. It swings like crazy too. The rhythm section is solid. If you dig straight ahead modern jazz, you'll dig this CD."
5,Esphera 360 World Globe,It was difficult to get started but once you got going it was easy enough to put together. (Just be sure to go by the numbers.) The end was more difficult because of the limited space. All in all it was a neat puzzle to do and to display.
5,TRACK LIST,ORIGINAL RELEASE 1976/TOMATO/1989 RELEASE/Song titles: Black Night Road/ Cold Wind Blowing / Cut off from My Baby / Feel Like Robbin' the Grave / Mean Old Woman /One Woman Man / Playing with the Thing / Selling Out / That Train and My Woman / The BOOGIE/
4,Clear and easy to apply rules for design,I used this for designing my website and it lifted the site at least 100%. The rules in the book are easy to apply and remember - there are just four of them.
5,Great book,This book is worth every penny and time spent reading. It has taking me from a novice to understanding design. It is great for reference also.
4,2 Good Mixes i find on this CDS,"*I favour Twisted Dee Club Mix and Jamie J. Sanchez Club Mix.*Both will fit great in the clubs. And both sound great on my Creative Gigaworks S750.*Other mixes are just OK to me (Livewater mix i find better then Xenon mix though).*As for the Jack D. Elliot mix - it's a bit boring and sounds low volume most of the time (WAV file).*This CDS comes in a DVD case and has different cover.*On the CDS you can read ""the anniversary remix collection: vol. 1"" - well there is vol. 2 out there too (it contains only 1 mix called Nic Mercy's Epic Anthem Mix and can be bought at BeatPort COM).*On BeatPort COM you can buy 320kbit mp3, VBR mp4, buy and download a WAV (!)."
5,Helped My 14 yr old Dog,I have an elderly tibetan terrier (14 yrs old) who started having trouble getting up and seemed to be in some pain. My vet recommended liquid glucosamine. I did some research and testing of a few brands. The k-9 level 5000 had the best results for my dog. We have been using it for a little over a year now. This has helped greatly with his aging agility. While nothing can take off the years from his joints I found this to be very helpful and use it daily for him. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a liquid glucosamine. It has been extremely helpful given my experience.
2,Not enough difference,"The product is backed by the Great Dane Lady, but from my experience, there just wasn't enough improvement in my dog for me to purchase this again."
3,Not a miracle cure,"I think these kinds of products are very difficult to evaluate. I have an older Newfoundland with pretty severe arthritis of the spine. She is not on any pain medication at this point, and I tried this product after having used Flexicose for several years. After several months, I don't notice an improvement, but to be honest, I don't know if she'd be worse if she wasn't on it. That's not something I want to experiment with. It then comes down to cost factors, which I think they are about even. I wish I could report things were much improved, but they are not."
4,"Great, but a little depressing for a child's movie...","I watched this movie as a little girl and really liked it. I remembered that it was a little sad, but I forgot how much as the years went by. i recently bought it for my daughter and decided to watch it again before she did, and I'm glad I did. It's a wonderful movie with a good message, but she's only 2 and I think I won't let her watch this until she's 5 or so. I'll also watch it with her and talk to her about it afterwards."
5,Great plush toy to grow with your child!,"I love this puppy! I bought it for my son when he was born. He is now 4 and still loves his ""first puppy"". This is small enough for an infant and very soft. I have washed it AND dryed it my washer/dryer, and it holds up great. Great gift idea for new and expecting parents!"
1,Conair foot bath FB27R is not recommended,"This foot spa was very disappointing. It is very noisy for one thing, but the worst thing is that it does not heat or maintain the heat of the water. It says on the box that it heats, but the customer service rep. even admitted that none of the Conair foot spas have any heating element whatsoever. How do they get away with this false advertising?"
1,Waste of money,"Does not function as advertised. Does not heat or massage - I found that rubbing my feet on the attachments as intended makes my feet feel worse, not better. Motor is so loud that I could not hear the television over it, even at full volume. In the end I just soaked my feet in it unplugged for a few minutes until the water got too cold. I got this to replace a plastic bin I was soaking my feet in before, but in the end I use this in the same way, it just doesn't hold as much water. Don't bother purchasing this product."
2,shopper,"very cheaply made. No light to let you know machine is on, you go to one side for bubbles and other side for heat, but machine doesn't really keep water hot. If I had to do over, I would have spent the extra money and go a better one."
2,A disappointment but it's my fault,"I should have taken the other reviews to heart. I am a Bowie fan. This is NOT Bowie. Bowie's Low and Heros albums are raw and edgy. This symphony remake is way too ""artsy"" and unnecessarily complicated. Althought if you like classical music, you might like this CD."
3,"A short, sweet (but predictable) escape","Ariella lives a somewhat sheltered life in the family manor, under the watchful eye of old cousin Magda. Spending her free time in the forest, she discovers she has a talent for healing the woodland animals. Indeed, one day a handsome, wounded Kelpie, a water-living, magical creature in the shape of a horse, requires her assistance. Soon after, Ariella's world is shattered when tragedy befalls her father, and she is sent off to marry a horrible cousin. The River's Gift is filled with many, many predictable and clichéd story elements. However, for me it was a short, sweet escape from mundane reality during my lunch break."
2,question of demographics,"When I was in my teens, I loved this album. I recently decided to get it again as I had left it behind about the time I really started to get into rock music. I'm a sucker for special edition versions and was delighted that Paula Abdul's Spellbound had a limited edition counterpart. I was a little disappointed to receive it and discover that it was simply packaged as a make-up kit. I'm sure if I were a girl, I would be giddy over it. As it is, it is an embarrassment to my masculinity to have this copy on my music rack for all to see.For what it is, the music is great. Every song sounds just as good as I remember it. Just don't let my friends see it... I'll never live it down."
3,3 stars plus.,"Spellbound was Paula Abduls peak, Although its her 2nd #1 album, selling over 3 million copies, I think she sings better on this than her Forever Your Girl LP, the #1 smash Rush Rush is timeless. That ballad just I dont know what it does but its a chiller, Like Madonna's #1 platinum smash Crazy For You. Im not to sure about the whole album, But Paula did well here. cant expect every album to sell the same amount 3mill.is not bad. go P.A"
3,It's ok,"This is my second purchase of this album used, lmao. I had it before, but my music style has changed. It has it's moments. I love ""Spellbound"" and ""Rock House"" as dumb as those songs are they have some tight house beats!If you can find it used and cheap buy it! I know I did, lmao @ ""Vibeology"" what a song."
2,Not Great But Not Awful,"This product would be a good buy for under $10. The completed ""robot"" goes in a short straight line when you push a button on your tv remote control. Son quickly lost interest."
5,Greatest movie ever,I love the movie the five heart beats I think it was one of the gratest movies ever and i can not understand why it is so hard to find. We as a black race don't have that great of a selection of black videos and it seems the ones we do have are almost non-exsistant. I love this site and I'm very greatful they were able to help me find this VHS. I wish they would put this movie on DVD i'm sure you will make a fortune.
5,A cookbook for the imagination!,"There's really not a lot of good material on teaching the martial arts. Sure, you can find many great books on technique, or on teaching in general... but how many of them are written by people who can offer you valuable strategies for motivating your students to improve? This book does just that!I try to make lesson plans (also discussed on this useful CD), but sometimes I just don't find the time. Instead of falling back on doing ""the same old"" drills (not that that's always bad ;>) again, you can use the excellent ideas from this book to help you create new ones, specifically tailored to the needs of your class.Don't be discouraged by a few presentation negatives. I've found this little gem to be a continously useful source of great information! This author knows what he's talking about in martial arts teaching."
