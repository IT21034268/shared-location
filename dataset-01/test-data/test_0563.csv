2,Bad acting!,"I have a 3 year old so I am used to watching annoying movies. However, this was seems a lot worse. The acting is horrible and Santa is kind of creepy. Whenever we try to watch it my daughter starts crying because she says it is scary. I would expect acting to be horrible in a movie made for toddlers, but it seems to be too scary for toddlers. I am not really sure what age it is appropriate for..."
1,Too Dark for Young Children,"Bought to surprise my two young children for the Thanksgiving Weekend. They love all the ""Buddies Movies"", what a nightmare it turned into. Think ""Ophan Annie"" meets Santa w/ memory loss. Very sad, my 5 yr old was horribly upset, my other child wouldn't even watch it, and I cried through the entire movie. The entire movie is dark and sad except for the last 5-10 minutes, then it's all warm and fuzzy. To get to that point thouogh is tourture. I'm not even keeping it, I can't return it since we already viewed it, I guess I will donate it to the library or church, I might stick my own warning label on it though, so someone doesn't experience the same thing we did. What a horrible evening it turned into, even my husband was sad.If you MUST see it, rent it first!!!! I'm very disappointed with Disney on this one!!!"
1,Not for us,"This movie is mostly dark, sad and borrowed. It's like Annie meets Santa Paws but where Santa Paws endears himself to a bunch of little girls, looses his power crystal and then becomes a stuffed animal that almost gets burned up in the trash. My 5 year old ran away from the TV and put her face in the wall while my 7 year old cried her eyes out in hysterics. Yes, the cliche ""greedy, thinking only of money"" character somehow sees the true meaning of Christmas. However, that story has been told in much lighter and more effective ways than here. And the message was lost on my kids who couldn't see past the terrifying plot points Disney felt they needed in order to reach a larger audience? Such a shame. If you haven't seen the first Santa Buddies movie, get that one. MUCH better, nice story, nice message, fewer tears. I hate that I spent the money on this. Worse, I hate that my kids will have bad dreams tonight."
1,Deserves no stars!,"I can't write about all that is wrong with this movie. I wish I had previewed it before my 6-YO granddaughter watched. What we planned as a fun time together turned out with her hiding her face and crying through most of the most mean-spirited 96 minutes previewed to be an ""instant holiday classic, full of fun, adventure and a timeless message sure delight the entire family."" Total trash."
1,Terrible,Horrible story line. So sad to Orphans. They are locked in the basement & toys are burned. Santa gets hit by a car and the dog was put in the incinerador. I wish I could give it 0 stars!
3,buddies fans,"my kids are buddies fans so this christmas we had to get SP, SP2 and SB. of course, they love them but I'm getting kind of sick of them all."
5,SANTA PAWS BLURAY,Was a super movie and a super price. Wal-Mart could not match it at all. Very pleased and will order more. In fact Wal-Mart did not sell Bluray version of this and their regular DVD cost more than Amazon Bluray.
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I unfortunately bought this for my children for christmas based on the previous buddy movies put out by Disney. We have all the other ones: Space Buddies, Santa Buddies, and Snow Buddies, which my children love. Thinking this movie was like the other ones was a huge mistake. I read 5 star and 1 star comments and rather than repeating what has already been said, I would agree whole heartedly with the 1 star comments. If you are not sure what to do, as I am many times I try to find movies that are appropriate for young children, please RENT and WATCH first to see if you feel this is an appropriate move for your children. My daughters comment, after STOPPING it before the movie ended, was ""I never want to see that movie again"" and "" Now I am going to have bad dreams"". She is 5. In short it took me an extra 15 minutes to get her to bed because she was so upset by it!!!"
4,Enjoyable,"My six year old loved this movie and after renting it asked if we could buy it. She loves ""Annie"" and this is a Christmas twist of the unwanted orphans with a mean caregiver who end up helping Santa who is lost in New York with amnesia. A predictable movie that is filled with cute talking dogs."
1,Completely unworthy of Disney name,"After 7 years of parenting and almost the entire Disney vault of movies, I had come to see Disney as a source of safe and fun entertainment that usually comes with at least some entertainment value for parents as well as the kids. This movie is pretty much devoid of all of the above. Granted, the other puppy movies in this series were not exactly Disney's best work, but at least they weren't seriously questionable for children. As for entertaining the parents, I have seen hundreds of kids movies by now, but this one really sets a new bar for flat-out plagiarism, character cliches, and entirely contrived scenes. Top that off with a twisted portrayal of the beloved Santa Claus character and I can't wait for this movie to end. Disney seriously owes parents an apology for this movie."
3,Thought it was a good movie,"I rented it(Redbox)despite the negative comments I read on here.My kids 7 and 5 y/o old watched it with me.It is a sad movie but has a happy ending.You can't deny the bad things that are happening around us.It is part of life.Life is not sugar and spice and everything nice.Life comes with both good and evil.You can't deny that.Overall,I thought it was worth watching."
2,"Scared my child, weird, and dark","My 5 year old daughter and her 6 year old friend could hardly wait to receive this movie as they like the first one so much. This one is nothing like that. The concept of the story is way too heavy for them and over their heads. My daughter asked me to turn it off because she was scared. The girl in the story lives in an abusive orphanage where the head mistress proceeds to burn her toys and the other children think they will be next. Santa gets injured, it's all very weird and you hardly even see the cute dogs. I do not recommend this film, really for any age."
1,Ho...hum... Wake me up when you frag me.,"Between Quake 2 and Quake 3, better settle with Quake 2 or go pick up Unreal Tournament. This game is just too boring and slow. I think it has something to do with the OpenGL engine or maybe the designers at ID software just got tired of revising a tired old game. Maybe they shoudve changed the name of the game to something else. Action is slow. Weapons are just too boring to use. It has no alternate fire still. Sound is the same old monoaural type clunky thumping sound. Interface is still a pain. Just setting up a server requires you to open your .cfg files and .bat files and type lines and lines of code unlike Unreal Tournament where everything is there at a punch of a button. Maps require no strategy primarily because they all look alike. The CTF maps are bad. I mean really terrible. Bots are just too dumb to play with. This game will wear you down in 2 hours. Forget this game. Go pick up Unreal Tournament."
3,A fairly basic martial arts manual,"San Shou is one of the fastest growing martial arts in the the world of competive martial arts. Unlike Wushu, San Shou is supposed to be full contact oriented and generally involves punches, kicks, throws, ground fighting and joint locks.With that said how well does this manual show it? The various progression of pictures are too small to really let you see the intricacies of the techniques and the blurbs associated with them are very basic. Except for the totally uninitiated I would say that this book is unlikely to add much to ones arsenal. For those that are totally unitiated then this book might just get you through your first trial but you will probably want something more afterwards."
4,Untamed is a romantic love story worth reading,"Elizabeth Lowell's, UNTAMED, is packed with suspense and filled with many romantic love scenes. Although it is set in the medevil times,it doesnt stop Elizabeth Lowell from giving us an emotional thrill of erotic love images for the readers of today. Meg, the bride to be, dislikes her father's idea of setting her up with a marriage proposal with someone she does not love. She finds out that love is a bondage between two people who feels each other's emotional needs. Does her husband to be have that chemistry? You would have to find out for yourself, for this story deals with many climatic scenes where both meg and her husband to be, are finally finding out what true love is and what true love isn't. Untamed overall is a great book to read if you enjoy the suspense of erotic love scenes between two people. Your head will explode and your heart won't stop beating any faster when you read this exciting love story by Elizabeth Lowell."
2,Dreamweaver 2 and 3 were better,"Ditto to everything ""arryman"" said below. I am an Art Director and I recently upgraded from version 3. The older versions were built extremely well and I liked Dreamweaver, because it was one of the few WYSIWIG web design tools that did not ""mess up my code."" This new version runs very, very slowly, inserts code in ""wrong"" places, adds redundant and unneeded tags and crashes in the middle of doing all that! I like the interface and obviously the support for CSS, but I've been finding myself hand-coding in ""Code"" mode, and not really taking advantage of the WYSIWIG tools."
1,No as pictured,"This product shows a round top that crushes pills easily. The picture is exactly the one I had from a hospital to crush my sons pills with. I ordered three, but when received the top was flat and was grated. The inside bottom was grated also and made the medication stick to the top and bottom, therefore my son wasn't getting the full dose. They were returned."
2,Do not buy,"Don't buy this product unless you rarely need to use it. If you drop it, the red plastic bottom will crack and then not stay on. Also the plastic threads on the lid that screws into the base can splinter off into the medication. And with large pills, the device just gets wedged shut where it won't come loose or tighten down and crush. We crush dozens of pills a day and have gone through way too many of these. Unfortunately it's the only model our pharmacy sells."
2,Just me. (Who's that Heifetz guy?),"Bought this book for an elderly professional musician who's heard all the virtuosos, and knew some of them pretty well. He considered this book disappointing, and little more than a puff-piece, one long ""press-agent's blurb"".There are many much better first-person books about the world and life of great violinists."
2,Remixes Not 2.0,"The remixes for Androgyny are nothing compared to those done for Version 2.0. Both mixes run about MAYBE 4 minutes long (or a little over) and have manufactured beats throughout. There is nothing original about either remix because once they begin they stay very constant in sound throughout. Both versions take out some of the best qualities that make Androgyny such a great song (the guitar riff, the final verse, etc). After the remixes that were done for the songs off Version 2.0 I really expected better for this song."
1,Where was my package?,I ordered my flag on September 7th and didn't receive the order until September 24th. This was 8-11 business days past the time the package was scheduled to arrive. I will be careful the next time I order from this company.
4,"Good, basic tips to use","This book has some great, basic tips to put into action right away. It was a quick read and should be easy to put in place."
5,Perfect Rubinstein!!!,"I had listen many recordings of the 4th and 5th piano concerto.There is only one record that is in equal level: Maurizio Pollini with Karl Bohm.Rubinstein here is very, very great! Excelente! With his tecnicaly hability beter, Rubinstein played these concertos right!"
3,Good for a brushup,"Having graduated with a BBA in Marketing, yet having forgot some of the raw fundamentals, I purchased this book. It helped to brushup on some topics, and I also learned a couple of new tidbits. Some of the material is for academic purposes only with little real-world use and is perhaps a little out-dated. Having said that, I still find it a useful reference for terms and marketing stratagies and a good reference and starting point for topics such as a product's life cycle. Elementary and short."
1,did not live up to its name,The unit did not live up to its name. Would drop out at random and would not carry the bandwidth stated in tech information. Sent back for refund. Zoom tech support not existence. Would not call back after I contacted them.
4,IT'S NOT SO BAD!,"So many people have been saying bad things about ""Androgyny"". I think it's a great song. Sure Garbage has never sounded so ""pop"" until this album, but that doesn't matter. I really do like the sound of Androgyny even though I don't listen to much pop. The message in the lyrics is really good too. It's like many songs by Garbage; the more you listen to it the more it grows on you. You really should listen for yourself. The song ""Begging Bone"" is great too. It's one of those many Garbage B-sides that should've been on the album. It sounds more like Garbage than many of the Beautiful Garbage tracks. This one song is reason enough to buy the single."
4,I OFTEN REREAD THIS,"...particularly the chapter ""How to Look at Oil Painings"". The chapter is about looking at the crack pattern on the back of an oil painting and how you can tell a lot of information about the type of painting, and when it was painted, just from that crack pattern. Lots of the other chapters are excellent as well, but this one tickles me each time I reread it. I would recommend a prospective buyer pick up a copy at a bookstore, and read a chapter at random. If you like that chapter, chances are you will be delighted with the entire book.P.S. Another book worth looking for that approaches this topic from a different viewpoint is THE AWAKENED EYE by Ross Parmenter."
5,The perfect Drawing Table for my needs,"I needed more space to design and capture my ideas on where I could spread things out and work. This drawing table is the perfect choice. It was easy to assemble. I think I looked at the assembly instructions three times to figure which screw to use. It was pretty self-explanatory what went where.Drawbacks: It is one height which is the right height for me to work when I'm seated. But, it would be nice if it could move up and down. I like to think on my feet and I would like to be able to work while standing. The plastic trays are a little flimsy, but functional.Advantage: Price, price, price. A drawing table that could move up and down would cost a bunch more, so I think on my feet and sit to write or lean over onto the table top. So, it evens out. You just can't beat the price tho."
4,top arrived cracked n a hassle to send it back for new,"HiThis is a GREAT table. The TOP maple part arrived CRACKED and it would cost a fortune and be a major hassle to send back. It would be waayyyyy cool if you would send a replacement top!! Be Christmas againThanksMarianne Wilde720-544-10449814 E Arizona Dr # 534Denver, CO 80247"
4,"Table is Decent, But Frustrating to Assemble","I am quite pleased with the Adjustable Art Table. However, assembling the table was quite frustrating at times. Connecting the table top to the stand required two people and the screws were somewhat difficult to get in or even fit in some cases. Additionally, the metal tool provided to screw in the screws eventually became stripped and useless. I recently put together two items from another retailer and found the experience extremely easy to follow and fun, while this art table experience almost made me want to return the product to avoid the annoying obstacles that popped up. All in all, this is a fine table."
4,Great product,"This bag has everything necessary for pet emergencies! I really love the included pet first aid kit. Our dog is a part of of our family, and I feel safer knowing I have the basic necessities to help keep him health if an accident occurs."
3,Mostly a generic book on writing,"This book is well-written and fairly thorough in its discussion of writing for the non-fiction market, but it's more like a book on writing than a book on garden writing. Most of the information and advice would apply equally to any non-fiction, free-lance work, especially when taregted at newspapers. I had hoped for more about the difference between today's common garden writing and the cherished books and newspaper columns of the post-Victorian era. While there are exceptions (Beth Chatto's books come to mind), much of today's garden writing is sterile and mechanical.I had hoped that this book would address ways to introduce persoanlity, excitement and passion into garden writing, but all I got was another plowing of the familiar fields of grammar and structure."
5,Don't call it a comeback,"The finest MC of all time has not missed a beat - rippin it up like 1988. Rakim is smooth like Jazz and can teach Puffy and his posse what its like to bring it - mad, mad skilz. Required listening for anyone interested in what hip hop really should be with no gimmick hooks."
2,"The final product looks nice, BUT.......","it was difficult to assemble because of poor instructions and low quality parts.The product was obviously not made in this country (but what is nowadays?). The instructions were terrible and hard to understand. One side piece was not even drilled out. The welds on the piece were cracked. Just poor workmanship all around! What should have taken 15 minutes, took 1.5 hours to figure out, redesign, drill, and assemble.Although the final product looks nice (thus the 2 star rating), I would not recommend this product to anyone. I feel like I almost constructed it from scratch!"
2,Not worth it!,"This was a pain to put together and more flimsy than I expected. There is a chain to hold the lid on, but no way to attach the chain to anything! The mesh side panels fall off very easily, especially when the bench is moved. Also, I ordered black, and mine arrived in navy blue and silver. I would not recommend this product."
4,Good book. Not entirely what I expected.,"The book was great. It painted an all-too-true picture of today's code monkeys (myself included) and their environment. However, the format, story, and outcome were not quite what I was expecting (or hoping).I read it upon recommendation from a friend. The way he described it misled me into believing it was a story of self-empowerment (i.e. get-yourself-outta-the-coding-trenches-and-do-something-rewarding!).Although that's not entirely the message given, it was still a great snapshot of the current industry and also describes a sample method and outcome in trying to overcome the shortcomings that we face."
1,Bad,Just awful.Ludicrously horrible. Poorly sourced. Poorly written. Absurdly graphic about items for which there is no substantiation.A shameful mess.
2,it's hard to care about the characters when the main guy is a jerk,Ben stiller has some funny lines here and there but overall this was another huge disappointment from him. He plays a truly unlikeable person who seems to questionably assault his brothers personal assistant while he is away and be emotionally volitale while being trapped in his own head. The female lead was played very well. I felt sorry that through the whole film she'd actually think Stiller was her best option for a man. who wouldn't want to be impulsive and not work just because you don't think the world is right? Nothing made me want to cheer for the lead. If the movie focused on the leading lady you'd think Greenberg was a psycho pervert.Very surprising to see jennifer Jason leigh (abeit briefly) after all these years.
2,What about the dog?!!?!,"This movie is fairly terrible. I think we are supposed to find some depth and meaning in the existence of such awkward and neurotic people but it didn't do anything for me. The ""romance"" between the lead characters is completely unbelievable. However the worst part of this film for me is the dog. Well the dog is actually wonderful and that's the problem. I was wondering if the dog was okay through most of the film. If you are an animal lover this movie will drive you crazy with worry! At every turn I expected him to forget to give Mahler(the dog) medication and find him dead. Very distracting. I know it seems ridiculous but there you have it."
1,Dreadful,"Aimless, boring, every minute of this felt like an hour. We got half way through and stopped. No need to waste our time."
1,AWFUL WASTE OF TIME,"This was the worst, most disappointing film ever! It wanders aimlessly, with no plot. There are some very inappropriate scenes for no reason. And worst of all, I like Ben Stiller in comedies and keep waiting for it to get better. But in dark films he is terrible. And this movie never gets any better, never goes anywhere, never resolves anything, and he just makes faces, takes drugs, and it ends abruptly. Stay away!"
2,Didn't even finish it,"I like The Squid and the Whale, and Kickin and Screaming, so I had high hopes for this. It was so tedious and it felt like the story had been told before. Guy from New York complaining about LA? See Swingers; Entourage; Larry David. I didn't even bother to finish it."
1,"really bad, don't waste your time.","The worst. Very disappointing. Miserable waste of time. Hated it. Bad beginning, middle and end. I expected more, and was surprised to see these talented people perform so badly."
1,Shockingly unpleasant viewing experience,"Despite the negative reviews I read about Greenberg, I still expected to like it. After all, I like the director, the lead actor, and dark movies. Unfortunately, however, it turns out that I liked nothing about Greenberg. Maybe you'll respond differently to the film, but I suspect the majority of you will find the film as unpleasant as I did."
2,Very Disappointing !!!!,"This film is still showing at my local theatre weeks after it came out. I am in Rhinebeck NY and the director went to Vassar which is nearby so maybe that partly explains it. Personally, I can't figure it out. This movie has 0 redeeming qualities. Ben Stiller is very creepy in this role and in the way the camera makes him look. There are plenty of depressing and/or narcissistic films out there that I have enjoyed since I first started watching movies over 40 years ago, but this isn't one of them. In a rare moment for us, my wife and our son went as well and their review is essentially the same as mine. The trailer to this film is phenomenally misleading as it really made me want to see this film. You have been forewarned !"
1,Stink.,"Pointless movie.Don't waste a dime on it.It was a total downer.Never in all my life was I so happy to have a movie just stop--not end mind you, just stop--The END."
1,BORING......,I expected more from Ben Stiller. The plot was utter nonsense; the story went NOWHERE. Thank god I only spent a dollar on renting this via REDBOX. Clearly a vanity project for Ben.
3,difficult to watch,"A film about a man with mental health issues who has difficulty in social situations, as he engages in a relationship with the personal assistant of his brother. Ben Stiller portrays one of the most annoying and unlikeable characters of recent memory, making the film difficult to watch at times. There is little engaging drama here, but the movie provides a look at a man who is searching for a meaningful relationship in his life. The slow pacing and paucity of dramatic moments make it a hard sell, but Greenberg does have its redeeming qualities in that this is a look at real life, and the issues a socially awkward man has to deal with. Good work also by Greta Gerwig as the female interest."
2,Not recommended,"We gave it 1/2 hour before we couldn't stand it any more and pulled it. It was like watching paint dry. The opening is like an omen. You watch an average girl walk a dog, go to the laundry, drive for a rediculously long and boring time, etc.We kept waiting for something to happen and to figure out what this was about, but it just never got any more interesting. Very, very dull.We're big fans of Ben Stiller, but I can't recommend this movie. It's not worth your time or money."
5,It was worth waiting for,"Chico DeBarges' new CD ""long time no see"" was truly worth waiting for. His voice is strong, his words are tight and he's just plain fresh and dynamic. I enjoy listening to his CD am sure that he will continue to produce quality work. Chico, what ever you sing, you have a fan in me. Good Luck and much Love FAITHFUL LISTENER Lisa"
5,Long TIme No See Is A Terrific CD,"I was surprised when I heard the cut, Love Still Good, several years ago when I lived in Connecticut. Through that one song, I was able to feel Chico's pain and disappointment once he got out of prison. I think what amazed me the most was the exceptional style Chico created in this project. Though some would say that they cannot get into his music, I respond with this simple statement: One has to have a certain level of maturity to understand Chico's musical style. And I must give him credit, this is his best project yet in my opinion. I am glad that he matured while he was in prison and didn't allow his circumstances to determine his present. He pulled himself up by the bootstraps and followed his dream. I admire that about him as well. So keep on singin for me Chico. Your number one fan!!!!"
3,"Chico, ya got some 'splanin' ta do...","Ok, ok, ok....I know you wanted ta express yourself and ""blow up"", as it were, after doin' time, but caa'mon, man! A coupla them jams like ""Superman"" and ""Iggin' Me"" sound too much like D'angelo...in fact, when ""Iggin.."" was out and they were playin' it on the radio, I bet D' said to himself, ""Hmmm...I don't ever remember doin' THAT jam, but I must have...."""
3,Good book for young teens...,"I felt that this book and the series in general is a good description of young wiccans growing up. I find the info on Wicca to be accurate. Don't judge the series just by this book, it gets better and quickly exits the realm of Nubbie wicca into a mature place. Enjoy! Ember"
4,Good quick read.,"I read this book along time ago and wanted to reread it. It is a good book, though definitely for younger people."
3,It Was Okay,"It seemed to drag on a bit and the author says how they practice Wicca in this book is how it is practiced for real, but I was confused as to if the results were what could really happen? (POSSIBLE SPOILER) Like if love spells would really cause a guy to notice you, fall in love with you and dump his girlfriend? Or if it would cause all the guys in your school to openly firt with you and think you're pretty? Anyway if you have an amswer to that email me @ happycupcake19@gmail.com"
4,Hello Again!,"This was a present for a family member, so I haven't actually watched this DVD tht I purchased, but I have seen this movie before and it is a wonderful movie about love n pain n everyday life with a slight twist to it. Definitely a recommended buy!"
1,Hello Again,"The movie you sent don't work at-all. I spoke to other people that order the same movie with the same result. this means they put the money in the bank for x-mass and got intrest on it. yes they might give your money back, but who realy made out. I still don't get what I paid for...... its my fault for trusting mail order."
5,Hello Again,"I thought this movie was very delightful, definitely a family movie and I really enjoyed it. I am trying to buy a copy, but it not in print at this time."
2,disapointmeant,"I fealt this book was very lacking,in info. It only talks about shooting for competing, not hunting or just for fun. No tips to help improve my type of shooting. No tips on how to work up loads to crate a good gun load combo. Only load data on a few select calibers. His faverit. Data you can get in any loading book. This book to me was a wast of money."
4,Sololink is not the only dynamic dns service available,everyone should try dyndns for free dynamic dns servicehttps://www.dyndns.org/
1,Only if you have time,"The camera does works but is very difficult to set up and administer. Also, Linksys tech support is among the worst I've ever used. I used the camera for about 9 months, but finally threw it out because I just couldn't bear to waste any more time on it."
4,Great camera. Easy setup. Recommend.,"Set it up in about 10 minutes right out of the box. I had it working on my Wi-Fi net perfectly. The image quality was adequate, and it offers several options on resolution, quality, etc. All in all, a great little toy for the price!"
2,More of a toy than anything,Just got this cam in the mail yesterday. Setup is pretty painless but the included software is strange. I was not aware that this camera wouldn't work pointed out a window. I tried for 3 hours to fix the crazy light balancing thing. It was even a typical overcast rainy day here in Portland and the cam picture was completely white from too much brightness; strange! The video quality is average. You'd expect it to be a little better for $200. Save yourself some money and use www.dyndns.org instead of Linksys' SoloLink solution. Works like a champ!
2,She's going back...,"Linksys got a few things right like the wireless connection and the support for DNS. However, the camera itself is weak. The lense is the size of a pin head so need I say more about lighting problems. I expected a lot more from a camera that was almost $200. I'm sending it back for a refund. Dissapointed enough to write a review!"
1,waste of my time,"1) It doesn't capture still images. Only video. To get stills, you need to do a manual screencap, and then manipulate that image in a picture editor. This is the most basic thing you can expect of a camera, and this one doesn't do it.2) Poor video quality.3) Not only will it not do still image capture, it will only record in microsoft format video files. I didn't buy a $175 internet camera so that only people with a particular browser running a particular OS on a broadband connection can see it.4) I didn't have a hard time configuring it, but I do happen to be a computer expert, so I can't really judge."
4,Good Camera for the Price,"OK, so the camera doesn't have pan and tilt features or audio. But its also about $100 bucks so if you're using it for monitoring a pet from home, or other functions that don't require a fully functioning security camera, it works great.Also, keep in mind that there are free Dynamic DNS services available that accomplish the same thing as the SoloLINK service. So the $20/year that you would fork over for the service is not really required.My only issue is linksys's customer support. My suggestion would be to chat with them on their website, rather than to call, as they seem to have habitual problems with their phone system (e.g. me getting randomly getting disconnected). The language barrier that exists with foreign call centers also tends to be mitigated somewhat if you communicate via chat.I give it 4 out of 5 stars because of the support issues."
3,"Pretty, but","I was happy with the watch until I wore it. Because the hands are gold, and the works are gold, it was extremely hardto read the time. I could not read the time at all in a sunny environment. You do have to constantly wind the watch to keep it running, which I did not mind too much. Anyway, it is pretty, but I had to return it."
4,Good Overview,"As a professor having a doctorate in I/O Psychology, this is a very user-friendly book, perfect for sophomore/junior level college students interested in I/O Psych. I always recommend this book to students who want to know more about general graduate school issues and who are leaning towards I/O. I don't require students in my classes to purchase the book, but I do suggest that they buy it, especially since the price suits the typical college student.One warning about the book, however, is that it includes a section on Human Factors which really is an entirely different field with its own various associations and journals separate from I/O. However, students are most likely not going to be introduced to the Human Factors field unless they research careers in I/O; therefore, its inclusion in the book is not a major issue for me."
3,This Info's Available Elsewhere,"This book contains pretty reliable information about what I/O psych is and what kind of careers can be expected. However, all of this information is readily available for FREE on the internet. The only advantage this book offers is that the info is conveniently collected in one place. If you don't mind paying for a little extra convenience, this book's for you. I recommend doing your own research and saving your money."
2,Cut & Paste,"Wow, talk about your crappy books! I strongly recommend that you spend 5 minutes searching Google with the parameters ""Psychology Industrial Organizational"". I can guarantee that you'll find the exact same information contained in this book.I'm giving this book 2 stars, because it would have some use in a high school guidance counseling office. However, if your not buying for that specific purpose and you don't mind reading off of a monitor you can save yourself a few bucks."
5,A Bargain,"I recently was forced to cancel my trip abroad and bought this book to fill the time. There's so much to do, it's like being on vacation in my own hometown. Wonderfully paced and thoughtfully written. I'm recommending it to serious jocks, as well as my slow tooling Granny who I know will enjoy the Golden Gate Park walks. For the price of two movie tickets, it's a deal that will fill many weekends to come."
3,IT'S OK......BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas. She loves it. I just don't think it is worth $25.00. You really don't need the mat. It does not hook up to the tv and they hardly use it for dance steps. You can just go out and by a dance tape for $9.99 and save yourself money.
4,Intricate story line,I was very very surprised by this book. The story had such depth. I was reading and out of nowhere an epic part of the story would happen. It was a very good and very different sort of vampire book. A very interesting concept that was executed very well.
5,show lead,I am very satisfied with the Martingale Show Lead. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good show lead.
5,Awesome Television,"I bought this television as a gift for my daughter. It worked perfectly, arrived timely and in perfect shape. I will definitely be purchasing my next television with these guys."
4,very nice classic shoes,good for office work or semi-formal dressing. Seems the length is greater than the size. great price and solid.
3,Form over function,"In the choice between style and substance, the author chooses style. Well, he's a professional designer! To the unitiated (like me) the design ideas are good, the information on processing images is good, and the outlook is fresh.The experienced software engineer, though, will cringe and wince. His recommendations for site architecture would spell disaster for any other than a small site, his use of tags would convert the HTML to page-layout, and some of the information in the book is in error. With the advent of DHTML and HTML 4, much of the remaining technical information in the book is out of date.Take the design wisdom, and disregard any technical suggestions."
2,Killer Web Sites is generally good but needs more detail,"Siegel's Killer Web Sites is generally a good book but really talks more about an attitude toward the web rather than dealing with what the web tries to offer, content. A third generation site is a good idea but Siegel tries too hard to make the argument that a third gen. site is the best way to approach web site design. You really need to get over Siegel's ego to enjoy this book. Sure, he has his following and there are many good points in his book. I trust that you will come away with some fresh ideas, however, I hope this is truely the last from Siegel on this subject."
2,Disappointing,"I expected so much more from a book of this title. I wasn't impressed. I've been a highly successful desgner for 12 years and this was what I might consider insulting to my inteligence, and design sensibilities. Do we have to listen to David's crap to learn what we need to know about site design?"
5,An Excellent design book for programmers,This is an excellent book for people who come from a more structured background like programming. This book has the details coders need to make serious sites. it has the tips that makes some web pages better than others.
2,Pretty outdated,"I bought this book and sat down to read it with great excitement, but that feeling has gradually dimmed as I get further into it. It does have the occasional handy tip, but mostly it's too outdated to be of any great use. Most of the sites he uses as examples of killer sites are not so great by the standards of today, and at least one that he uses as a major worked example in his gallery section as a site he created, has since been redesigned by other designers and is totally different. I'm just glad I picked it up cheap. It's definately a book that's well overdue for a revision."
5,"Deserves a ""Top 5%"" stamp of approval.","The book was great. Easy to understand and informative with great examples and visual giudes through out. Appendix 2 ""The Colour Cube"" section is something that I know I will use over and over again"
2,"""How to use Photoshop to control Web Page Layout""","Very good on details of implementing the layout you already designed, but NOT the book you want on site design principles. For navigation principles, see the Polar Bear Book (O'Reilly's Web Navigation). Some good visual design principles are in Lynch and Horton's Web Style Guide. I'm still looking for the perfect ergonomic UI book for application design."
2,"Glitz and glamor sells magazines, why not the web...","So many books on the subject of Web design that a person could spend hours just perusing the titles. David's foray into the market leaves the reader wondering if there is anyone else who designs pages besides Mr. Siegel, (at least if your were to ask him). It's true that the book and his site is visually apealling to the reader/visitor, beyond that... well, I hate to use quotes but ""Content is King"" and the content is not reinforced enough in this book or in the companion site. As the internet becomes more and more choked with new surfers jumping online everyday web designers must constanly provide content to visitors of all kinds, this includes text only browsers! If you buy this book make sure that you'll be able to get your money back after you get it home and find out that you've been gyped"
3,"Some useful info, mostly self-promoting babble","The most useful parts of the book included tips on web sitelayout and design, but it was difficult to wade through theridiculously pompous wording of his ideas. A couple of design ""tricks"" are useful as well with examples to see how the tricks work, but again, the ego-mania was a BIG turn-off. Going through the HTML of hit top 5% sites is helpful (even if some of those sites are his own!). There are better books out there -- this book certainly isn't the ""bible"" that many people proclaim it to be."
4,Great Service,"I ordered this book from Spain and expected it to be delivered within 1 to 2 months (that's what they told me), I got it after 14 days, nice!. The book is from a library and in a very good condition, exactly like they said. I'm very satisfied with this purchase."
2,Bags of crumbled cookies close to expiration date,"Of the four pouches of cookies I received, there wasn't a single ""whole cookie"" to be found. Alot of crumbles. The bottom of the bags it was down to granulations of cookies. Generally 1 inch-size pieces for the most part. Probably due to a combination of factors. The soft bag for one, and the handling at Amazon's warehouses and by UPS.I ordered in early July. They expire in early September. Which isn't too bad... but I'm thinking they may have sat on Amazon's shelves for months.Still, they are good... but not great. The chocolate pieces used were premium. But I experienced a bit of ""after-taste"" when eating with bottled water. The spices seemed too strong. Maybe it wouldn't be as noticeable with a glass of milk. On the ingredient list it simply says ""spices"". Spices that might be acceptable in New Mexico might be a little too strong for us in the rest of the country."
5,"miss thang brought the pain in tyrone, you better call him","Out of Atlanta Ms.Badu know what she's talkin about. After I bought all her C.D.'s, she came out with Live. A great gift!"
3,"Not LIVE, but still cool","First, let's get one thing straight. This is not a live album. No way. Look on the back, it was recorded at Sony, New York, not on stage. All the applause, crowd noise, the live sound- it's all fake.Now, why did Sony do this? Her debut, Baduism, was in all likelyhood not recorded by Sony, and picked up by the label without the anticipation of huge success. By the time the cat was out of the bag and the album was successful, it was too late to go back and fix the fact that Baduism sounds like it was recorded by a five-year-old. So, they re-recorded Baduism so it's listenable, faked it being live, and re-released it.And, yes, it does sound good. Good musicianship, good arrangements, good live-sounding production. I actually like listening to this album more than the original Baduism because of the egregious recording mistakes made in the latter.If you have a choice between Baduism and LIVE, get LIVE. But don't have any illusions that it is actually a live performance."
1,What a dissapointment,"Just another over rated so-called talented R&B; artist. Erykah, don't leave your day job honey.She uses snappy euphemisms to get her dimwitted messages across with a dry off beat annoying voice. Man what ever happen to the real divas, with rich singing voices. This and all of her albums are a joke. She is most definitely a one hit wonder chosen by those tone deaf people who buys her ""music.""Erykah, Buy-Don't"
3,Good,"The spikes work very well, but are sometimes hard to get on you shoes and they fall off if you take your foot out of the tree incorrectly."
1,Pretty much useless,"We bought these after seeing them in an adventure type catalog for our eleven year old boy. They looked like they'd be fun and helpful for gripping and climbing trees (as shown in the catalog). Perhaps we don't know how to use them, but they just fall off no matter how they are tied. Might be good for walking on icy surfaces, but not for our intended purpose"
4,Review of Shoe Horn,This product works well. I have trouble reaching over to get my shoes on and this product gives me the ability to do this without additional help.
1,Looks great --- but don't buy Piece of Junk,"Product looked great but after a few uses the horn pulled out or the handle jamming into your leg. Now it will not stay inthe handle. Very poor design as the horn was only press-fit into the spring handle. I see several others have had the same problem. I guess I will chalk this one up to live and learn, DON'T BUY IT!!! Get a solid one."
1,Poor design,"Shoe horn is connected to the handle with a spring. The spring has stayed well connected to the handle, but it HASN'T stayed connected to the shoe horn. They need to forget the spring and have a solid connection wedding the shoe horn and handle together."
4,nice stuffed animal,love blues clues! wonderful toy. good size. only thing that had me questioning it were the dark blue spots.. you could tell they were painted on (which is fine) but there was crusted on paint. i was scared to wash him as i thought it would come off completely. its still a little crusty on his spots but not as bad.
5,my grandson loves anything blue and this made his day,we had searched around alot for this delighful blue toy and book and cd..it made my grandsons month to be able to locate all of them..the smile on his face made it priceless
3,Buddy Blue,I purchased this Blue's Clues dog for my 20 month old son because he's a huge fan and has tons of DVDs so I thought that this would be a great addition. He absolutely LOVES this dog. He has to have it with him all the time. However; I was a little disappointed with the quality. We've had him for less than 2 weeks and Blue already has a hole in his leg where the seam is and the 1/2 of his mouth (the yarn) is coming out.
2,Did not hate it but do not care for it,"I picked this up for a reading course I was taking. Personally I would pass on this one. I do not like to tell people what to and what not to read, so pick it up and decide for yourself. You can usually decide whether or not you are going to read a book after the first few chapters."
1,Complete waste of time and money!,"This Praxis prep book is a complete waste of time and money! I must have quizzed myself at least five times from cover to cover and yet, the actual Praxis looks nothing like it. Yes, there were many spelling errors on the practice exam and the answer key also had several mistakes! I didn't give this book zero stars because that wasn't an option on the ratings scale. The book has incomplete bibliographic information and looks like it was printed by a third grade class. Shame on the writers and publishers of this book for deceiving and misleading the public in such a blatant manner!"
4,Interesting Book,"I opened this book already aware of many of the faulty beliefs of the Catholic church, but this book provided me with many new details that I as a Non-Catholic had not known before. For, instance the fact that your Salvation is tied to your attendence of the Catholic mass and your participation in the transubstansiation and that this will affect how much time you will have to suffer in purgatory for your sins. If you have ever found yourself wondering way some denominations are so hard on the Catholic Church, this book will give you a good education. My only complaint is that it could have covered much more than it does. It's a little narrow regarding the number of issues it covers."
2,"Nice effort, but very little accuracy","Not good. He quotes church documents and authorities, and then proceeds to get church teaching wrong. The chapter on baptism was hilarious. People need to learn that being raised Catholic, being an alter boy, receiving the Eucharist, attending parochial school etc. etc does not make one an expert in Catholicism or imply in the slightest that they should have any clue about Catholicism. I'm sure Bill's a nice guy, but this book didn't do anything for me."
2,Part of the truth. Read Wiherington and Sungenis,"If you are going to buy this book, don't forget that if we take a look at the protestantism we will find that there's no such a thing as the ""biblical christianity"". Some say that saving faith doesn't include obedience to Jesus as Lord. Some say that baptism is a channel of the salvation (evangelical lutherans and some baptists), but most denied this.Read ""The Problem with Evangelical Theology"" by the NT exegete Ben Witherington. He is evangelical and ""Not by Faith Alone"" by the Westminster Semminary theologian Robert Sungenis (a convert from fundamentalism)."
4,KSC-SW1,"Excellent small sub for under seat usage. Although measurement suggests it is smaller, due to round edges and top it needs slightly more space than you would think. Overall an excellent product at a good price."
5,favorite gift!!!,"my 2 1/2 year old received bella cinderella for christmas and has already gotten the moneyS worth out of it in only a week! we put the dvd in and she immediately began to dance! it was so adorable that we took pictures and video of her! what i love is that it gets her up and dancing around, much better than sitting still watching a movie! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY LITTLE GIRL WHO LOVES CINDERELLA!"
4,Good skewer.,"I've used this skewers several times. Good product and good value for the money. I'd thought it would be more on the flimsy side but that's not the case. It's pretty solid, can handle veggies and meat. I love that the edge is not sharp - so I don't have to worry about cutting my fingers. Great product and am very satisfied."
4,Smooth R&B track,"Mario Winans scores a huge hit with this soulful R&B track, ""I Don't Wanna Know"". Mario Winans' voice is complemented by a pretty smooth beat, but the presence of P. Diddy alone drops this song from 5 stars to 4. Still, Mario Winans sings well enough to make up for P. Diddy's below average rapping skills, making ""I Don't Wanna Know"" a huge hit."
2,Not so hot,"This unit replaced a simple but effective charger. Wish I could go back. Often refuses to ""engage"" because battery voltage is termed ""too low to charge"". (Jump start of engine is thus req'd to get recharge going) Display is too dim to view in any daylight condition. Controls and error messages are not intuitive, requiring frequent reference to manual. Despite revered brand name, surely there's something better out there."
5,fine reference,"This is a fine book with a cross section of typical structures. The authors used actual buildings and original photos as a basis for the drawings, so they are historically accurate and have an authentic feel, unlike the caricatures you often see in movies and miniature dioramas. I only wish there were more to it, or more volumes."
3,Disappointment,This book was much more violent than it was entertaining. It was just one fight after the other. I can not recommend this book.
5,The Trouble Shooter ala 'Macho Camacho' via Amazon.com,"The Trouble Shooter by Austin S. Camacho was a real page turner for me. The author obviously researched and planned the overall story, resulting in a great deal of detail concerning each of his main characters...each so distinctly individual.'Hannibal' was believable and fascinating albeit somewhat bulletproof. I came to be captured his tough guy description as he met every obstacle head-on without regard to his own safety. So he was the main hero but not the only one who fought for justice and peace in 'the hood'.Great Read! Good Feelgood Story.~ron aka lance knight"
2,Never made it past the first chapter,"As a born and bred Montrealer, with a couple of my own novels beginning in or passing through the city (see The Wrong Choice), Farrow has little grasp of the English language and reduces any chance of excitement to meaningless banality. Short on ideas, he attempts to cram the Russian Mafia, biker gangs, and the horsemen into the plot in the hopes that some excitement might result. Not."
2,Not worth the trouble!,"We recently replaced our two old monitors with two Gateway monitors- one 19 inch and the other a 22 inch. Right out of the box the 19 inch had a dead pixel. We took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for another of the same model- that one too had a dead pixel. Frustrated we took it back and once again exchanged it for the same model. This one luckily did not have any dead pixels! We were pleased and thought the first two must have just been a fluke. A few weeks have gone by and the 19 inch is still is working well, but now the 22 inch has a dead pixel! It's past the length of time we can return it so now we have to call Gateway and see if we can get it replaced. After all this we will certainly never buy a Gateway monitor again."
2,Disappointed,Just receieved this and it doesn't work... I am asking for a replacement or refund as I rather pay 30 for something that works than 10 for something I have to play around with.
5,Simply one of the most awesome discs in my collection.,"I've been a fan since 1978 and this one blew me away. Some of the Eric's and Alan's finest moments are here. Worth any price. It's a shame it hasn't beenheard by many, but that's one of the reasons this is such a rare, special disc. Incredibly addictive music. I've got 2 copies as well."
5,The Project's ABBEY ROAD - Buy it now!,"When I first listened to Freudiana, I wasn't sure what to think. A week later, it is now one of my cd's that no one is allowed to borrow! It truly is one of the best APP achievements."
5,Wonderful,"Im not much of a reviewer, but let me tell you this. I bought this album a month ago, and it's still hasn't been out of my cd player in my vehicle. I listen to it over and over. Its like a little story, you have to like all of it. Freudiana in my opinion, The song Freudiana to. Is pure satisfaction. It pulls you in. Eric's voice does that to you, not to mention that superb sound. I still look forward to getting in my truck just to hear it everyday. I think Im gonna order another copy just for a spare. Buy you wont be disapointed."
4,Good for the money,I really can't say anything bad about this product as I don't think I have had a power failure to put it to the test. It is always lit up as it is supposed to be and does it's job effortless.My previous power supply went out after a year or so and I have had this one several years so I can not complain what so ever.
1,Hook to large !!!!,A large bulkey wooden dowl with a large eye hook to big for a zipper hole. Had to buy a small package of screw in hooks that fits a normal size zipper. that all dresses come with.
2,return of rakim,"When Rakim says he's been gone a long time, it shows. I can't believe I bought this cd! The album has its' moments but overall it lacks the fly beats and Eric B. Rakim needs a duo to shine and a good beat to rhyme. Maybe his next return will be sweeter."
2,WUSB54G Adapter Uselss!,I brought these adapters a week ago to upgrade my network. I have a Linksys WRT54G router and notebook adapter WPC54G for my laptop. The two older USB network adapters from Linksys I used were working fine. I just wanted to upgrade my network to G mode. Big mistake!. I have spent 12 hr trying to get the new WUSB54G adapters working. I have the same problem as other reviewers. Get good signals but no/slow internet connection. The transfer rate fluctuate widely from 1 to 54 mbps. All the other computers work fine. The only good thing is it has been easy to reach Linksys technical support.
1,"PIECE OF JUNK, DON,T WASTE YOUR MONEY","Product actually doesn't deserve any stars as I have been unable to get 2 different units to work. This is even after talking with Linksys customer service which was actually very helpful but concluded the unit was just too far from router. Yet, it can see the other 13 networks on the block, but can't connect to any of them, even mine. I am not just bad-mouthing Linksys as I have a 54G router and 54G notebook card that work great. No problems. But this model is a TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,um... make sure your computer works with this,"HI,I bought this because I needed to connect to our home network. Well, this IS a great product. Just make sure you have a computer that works with this. I am a computer expert, if you will. I have had my ups and downs, and I will tell you, unless you are great with computers, don't try to fix the problem yourself. I knew all of our wireless settings and everything. I tried unistalling it (and the software) then re-installing it, making sure it was using the correct IP address and all of that jazz. So, turns out, when my computer was built, it ran with the first version of XP software that DOES NOT allow wireless networks. (yes XP did, at one time, not support wireless networks) So, I downloaded the patch that allowed it to support them. Turns out, the BIOS didn't support wireless communication at all. Just check to make sure your computer supports this. P.S. if your computer, or the version of win xp, is newer than 2002, you have nothing to worry about."
4,Plug and Play,Simple to setup. Backward compatibility with B routers. Fast data transfer rates. More versatile than a internal NIC card. Works like a charm.
5,No Problems,"Had no problems whatsoever hooking this adapter up and tapping into my home network. Currently have a Microsoft router, linksys vonage phone adapter, and a generic usb adapter. I was up and running with this adapter in 10 minutes tops. The router is upstairs and the computer with this adapter is downstairs and across the house and I have good-very good reception at all times. Couldn't be happier with what I paid (less than 20 bucks shipped on Amazon!)"
5,works,does what it is supposed to do. i have no drops or lost connections. works fine. use the windows xp wireless interface instead OF LINKSYS. IT WORKS BETTER
2,"Working, but not a recommended product","I had installed half a dozen of WUSB54G adapters, performance is ok while it's working, but it is just not stable enough especially some of the units are so close to the router that shouldn't have any problem."
1,Complete disappointment,"The adapter was working great until I decided to upgrade to a new computer. While I thought installation would be easy plug and play, it was not. After four calls to Linksys tech support and installing numerous driver updates, I still cannot connect the computer to the router (as a side note, I have another computer in the network NOT using a Linksys adapter, and it connects just fine).Save yourself the trouble, and do not buy this adapter."
3,Slow Internet Connection...,"I bought this product a few months ago to use in tandem with my Linksys 54G Wireless Router. Overall it delivers a somewhat reliable (sometimes requires a disconnect/reconnect) and somewhat slow internet connection. I spend a lot of time hitting reload on websites and get a bunch of ""page taking too long to load messages."" This is pretty ridiculous since I am most times receiving full signal and am literally one hallway away from the router.On the plus side, it does offer you a USB connection to your computer, which I suppose is a necessity for some people. You will connect to the internet, but don't expect wired speeds! Just bought a PCI-card. We'll see how that goes.Good luck all!"
3,Great product when it works,Product works great but has severe compatibility problems with Windows Xp home. Many hours and $100 to Dell on Call no resolution. Product works great sporadically.Will go cable very shortly and not even use it except when necessary.
4,Works perfectly!,"I liked this product so much I bought another. In over 3 years I have had only a single ssue with this wireless adapter.The first one I bought years ago has been 100% perfect. No issues.The second adapter, purchased recently, came with a different version of the User Interface (it was purple rather than green...) and may have had a different driver (unsure, really...) and I was unable to make the installation work. I had to bail on it and simply download the latest and greatest drivers and software from the Linksys site and transfer the files to the pc the adapter was intended for. It wasn't a problem for me, but for someone less computer savvy, it would probably cause them to return it to the store.However, once installed it has been nothing but smooth sailing:-)"
2,good idea bad concept,"Have all linksys router works great laptop pcmcia card is flawless,but this thing a piece of junk.When it works is good for web surfing but cuts off too much.Tech support online was able to help me make it about 25% better by changing settings but still cuts off.Ended up just running cat5 to desktop."
1,A very poor product,"I purchased the WUSB54G because it was supposed to be faster than my current WUSB11. However, it never worked or performed up to par. After numerous calls to Linksys it still will not connect to my network when I boot the computer. I have to manually click connect from the Linksys program. Linksys claims it is a driver problem, however the have not updated the driver in 8 months. Also, the range of the WUSB54G is poor at best. The only time I ever connnected at a speed of 40Mbps or higher is when I had my laptop in the same room as the wireless router (Linksys as well). All in all I give this product 1 star. It appears as if Linksys might have rushed to get this product to market before thorougly testing and working the bugs out."
3,Asteria - Slip Into Something,"It's average at best, there are better sounding bands out there that play similar music. Wish there were more songs similar to ""A Second Chance To Make A First Impression""."
1,Uselss and overprices,"This was such a disappointment. The tool was entirely useless, as the power level was so low that the tool stopped rotating the minute you touched ot to the nail. While the selection of accessories looked like they may have been useful, none of them worked because there was not sufficient rotational power to make them work. The price is a joke. Amazon should remove this item from their roster as it is a complete waste of time."
1,A waste of money.,"This item is so poorly made and does not work as advertised. It has so little power that the moment you touch the attachment to the nail, it stops rotating. I tried to return it immediately and was told by the seller that the item is non-returnable. However, I cannot find anywhere in the description where it states that the item cannot be returned.I am very disappointed with this purchase and feel that I was swindled out of $41."
1,Nail Care Plus,"Unfortunately not worth the money! It is not powerful enough to handle rough skin or heels at all. Therefore the batteries need to be replaced regularly, which is a big bummer."
4,Hard to use,"I just tried this product yesterday. It is definitely what I ordered and arrived in a timely manner. However, I am having a hard time using it with having to hold down the ""on button"" all the time. Wish it would stay on automatically, if you wanted it to. It is powerful enough to do what it is suppose to do. A lot of this is on my end as I have severe back trouble and it is hard for me to bend over to work on my toenails. However, I will keep trying and maybe I can get it done. It is better than paying for a trip to the podiatrist, which my insurance does not pay for."
4,It's pretty good,"""Dance across the Univerce"", I think is a very good CD, it has alout of good dance songs on it, and is good to party to! The song lemon tree, and others have great lyrics. This CD is a great mix of dance music!"
5,Great!,"I used the book to study for the TEA exam. It gave much better examples of what to expect on the actual test than some other books I purchased. The reading and investigative questions were helpful. If you're not good at math, you should refresh yourself elsewhere, but the review is great if you are."
4,Good book - but don't stop here.,"Arco's test prep books are very good, and Steinberg's is no exception. You'll have a pretty good picture of what to expect on the test after reading this one. I highly recommend ""Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement,"" by Thomas H. Ackerman, if you're interested in any federal law enforcement career with any agency. ""FBI Careers,"" also by Ackerman, is a great book to read if you plan on applying for a special agent or professional support position with the Bureau. Ackerman's books cover the tests, what to expect in the hiring process, interviews, application forms, KSA statements, and the background investigation far better than any other books. ""The book of U.S. Government Jobs,"" by Dennis Damp, also has great information about applying for federal jobs."
5,Awesome reference book with real strategies that work!,"This is a great reference book for anyone considering part-time and even for those that are already doing it. I have worked both part-time and in a job-share and this topic is a passion of mine. I find the information in the book helpful, accurate, objective and well-balanced. It's presented in a positive fashion - not like an unrealisic fantasy - more like ""if you want it bad enough you can get it, but you need to be persistent, open-minded and creative - and here are some strategies that really work."" The book spans different industries and professions, which brings even more ideas to the table. The interviews and real life experiences are both inspiring and comforting."
4,Architecture 101 for Integration,"This was an excellent read and well developed concept. This book can serve as a reference for the aspiring Integration Architect, and those just seeking to broaden their understanding of the complexity involved in integrating systems and data architecture. This is not a ""silver bullet"" approach - the authors state that it will take years to implement and ICC; further they offer 5 models for building the ICC so that it can be adapted to most organizations.For architects, this offers some great examples and illustrations (a picture is worth lots of words) - my only knock is that these are not available in Visio or PowerPoint for download.For those of you concerned about an Informatica bias or propaganda, if its there, its slight - I do not recall any emphasis saying ""use Informatica tools"" for this task.This will likely serve as a spring board for additional books on integration in the coming years - it provides numerous concepts, many of which can be expanded upon."
4,Don Giovanni with a difference,"Teddy Tahu Rhodes is the reason for getting this Don Giovanni-he sings well, acts well and looks like a man who could successfully seduce women. He was very good in the MET's ""Peter Grimes""(but that was a cast in which almost everyone was outstandingly good)and he matches that performance here."
2,Somewhat Beneficial,"Although this provides topics that may be on the test, this is in no way preparatory information for the entire test. I took nine Dantes tests...passed them all. I bought this book for one test, paid for practice tests online for three, and just searched the web for the other five tests. If you review the Dantes course and all that they provide as an overview, you can search and study on those key topics and pass the tests. No need to buy a book that doesn't cover everything on the test."
1,"Author doesn't research all her ""facts.""","I didn't finish reading this book. I stopped when she began referencing another crime (Rae Carruth's murder trial) and got most of the ""facts"" of that case incorrect. She jumps from one time period to another and back again. I noticed this in another book of hers that I read. I'll never waste another dime on anything she writes."
3,Slow read,This book has way to much background before it gets into the real story of Atlantic City. I was not impressed.
2,History of jersey city,"boring. And overly done. Tiresome to read as you know what comes out is what you just read. Because y ou just read it in the last paragraph. Sorry but I can""t really recommend this history."
1,disappointed,"I am an avid, diverse reader. After being immersed in medieval history for a few months, I thought this would be a good diversion as I am a huge fan of the HBO series There is NO way the series is ""based"" on this book. Other than the titles and character names they have nothing in common. This book is an extremely dull, repetitive recitation of other's thoughts and statements in reference to Atlantic City(Note the last 34 pages of a 284 page book includes an index of what seems to be every name mentioned and the sources for each ""fact"" given. I only managed to read about 40 pages before deciding it was a waste of time, as quite a few times Mr. Johnson made contradictory statements."
3,Interesting,Having been following the series on HBO I found this an interesting history of the area and the cast of characters.
3,Not what I expected,"by Emily Placido author ofJulita's Sands: A MemoirI read this book after seeing the ad for the upcoming HBO series, when I was at Book Expo America. I was so excited and began reading it as soon as I got home. Frankly, I was a little disappointed off the bat. It is very well researched with tons of information on the characters, but it sorely lacked the story about Atlantic City itself. There was no beacch or boardwalk history, which is what I was looking for. Hopefully the series fares better."
1,Propaganda Piece,"This read more like a Propaganda Piece than a history of Atlantic City, though the first half of the book was interesting."
2,boardwalk empire,was not expecting a history book type. rather dry reading. was not what I expexted and was not very enjoyable to me.
1,Ripe Off,Though the book title represents the series you see on TV it is very disappointing when you read it. Of course you expect the TV series to be enboldened but the accounts in this book are not even close.
1,Review for Kindle edition,"Most of the stories in this collection are not very good, and at least one is in no way a horror story. I bought the Kindle edition, and it is a travesty. Almost every page there is some kind of spelling error, which is very apparently from the book being scanned and not proof-read before sold. In the editor's introduction of the first author, he calls the writer a ""hack"" which is a comic misspelling, but not funny considering I paid $12 for this failure or a collection."
3,Grammatical horror!,"While the stories in 999 range from absurd to fantastic (it seems some authors didn't take it seriously) and I'm glad I read it, the grammatical errors were so ridiculously out of control I had a hard time making it through this book. It might have been edited by my 7 yr old niece! If you can make it through the outright stupid errors on every single page you will be rewarded with some jewels! I will definitely look into some of these authors. Unfortunately I had already read The Road Virus by Stephen King, but 999 was worth the SALE PRICE. I wouldn't pay full price."
5,Must-Read!,"Chilling, scary, disturbing and gross. Bottom line: very entertaining and just plain fun for any horror fan! Plus, you get the extra added bonus of ""discovering"" some new writers you may not have heard of before but will definitely want to follow from now on. Hope you get as much of a kick out of this as I did - it's money (and time) well-spent!"
3,It was ok,I thought a couple of the stories were great the rest was a waste of time. I wouldn't suggest picking this up unless you can grab it on the cheap.
3,"Not good, but not too bad for 1.99",There are many spelling errors and the stories lack plot. I'll read it anyway. I can't except much for the price.... just checking out the new Kindle.
5,Totally functional,"I bought two of theses boxes for my regular budgies. The box is big enough, with a cavity to hold eggs safely. My birds didn't had any problem because of its color. I love vent side. Any little size bird can fit easily in this box. It looks smaller on pictures.PROS.- Easy to set up on your cage, no extra tool needed.- Easy to check your birds on the inside.- Enough room for my regular budgies. Not recommended for english budgies.- Easy to clean.CONS.- When assembled, it seems like if it is about to dissasemble, beacues it looks delicate. I made some tests and it wont break or dissasemble with regular bird breeding work."
1,my birds wont go near it,"My parakeets( male and female ) that are both 3 year olds wont go near this thing. I have even tried putting their favorite treats on top of it.I think the color should have been anything other than black plastic, in my opinion parakeets probably respond better to colored objects."
2,Problems with File Locking,"Had major issues with this due to file locking settings (oplocks)This unit will not work with FoxPro programs and multiple users properly, and Linksys does not give access to be able to change the oplocks configuration."
5,Awesome,"I first stumbled upon Tom Booth's music as a singer with our local Life Teen group. He is a wonderful musician and I could listen to him for hours. I love almost every single song on this CD. But I especially love the songs: Find Us Ready, I Will Choose Christ, More Than Gold, We Will Serve The Lord, Be With Me Lord, The Lord Will Bless His People. I probably love them best because we sang them at church so we spent hours practicing polishing these in rehearsal. You can't go wrong by buying this CD.The song list is as follows:1. Find Us Ready2. Make His Presence Known3. I will Choose Christ4. Here I Am5. Give Thanks To The Lord6. Like The Bread7. More Than Gold8. We Will Serve The Lord9. I Cannot Tell It All10. Be With Me, Lord11. Create New Hearts12. The Lord Will Bless His People13. Profession Of Faith"
2,scratches very easily,this thing will scratch if you just look at it wrong. I am very careful and picky about scratches and blemishes yet somehow this thing has scratches. It came all scratched up right out of the box. I used plastic policy to buff them out but overtime this still gets scratched and I only had it 3 months.Filter is a little on the strong side for my betta...he normally stays off to one side since the filter return knocks him all over the place. The opening is hard to feed as well...and water runs down the back of the tank when you lift the opening. If you open it slowly this eliminates some of the dripping.Marinelands customer service is horrible by the way...basically it is non-existent. Do not bother emailing them.Overally kind of disappointed in this tank..and company.
3,Rebel Blanket,"Very soft and bright, but very very small. No size description available when purchased. Approximately 4ft x 2ft"
3,i dont know yet,sorry cant help much here i bought it for my pc and found out when i got it that it was for a laptop.It does look great though i just dont like the retractable cord
5,Outstanding Results with My Weight,I have been unable to lose a pound for ages since I was first diagnosed as type II. I have followed the good eating suggestions in this book and have dropped 10 pounds in the last month! I am enjoying the foods I am eating and the book's information on this topic is great! I think I have learned more about my problem and how to deal with it than I ever got anywehere else! The book is easy to read and comprehend.
4,Nicely written book about Diabetes,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who has diabetes or has it in their family (like me). This book goes over the causes and effects of diabetes in laymans terms. It's easy to follow and also includes a 1,500 calorie meal plan that has a lot of variety and is based on the Mediterranean food pyramid. You won't feel deprived at all. The book strongly encourages daily physical activity by making the point that every step you take makes you less susceptible to the disease. Or if you already have diabetes, it helps your body to deal better with it. My reason for giving this book 4 stars is that no soy products are mentioned. The author says that if you're lactose intolerant, you should take calcium supplements instead. What about calcium fortified soy milk? I wish the author had addressed this. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in the long handled bath sponge with soap holder. The back of the sponge is a very dense hard rubber with a very small slit inwhich to put the soap. You can only use a very small piece of soap(hotel guest soap size)and even that is very hard to put into the slit. After all the effort, the sponge did not suds up in the shower."
1,poor product,i could not find the soap holder part. there was no space to put any size soap. the plastic is sharp on the edges and i ended up cut by it. you would be better off with one from the dollar store
1,magnet,This item is way too small to be of any use. I was hoping for a larger disc magnet.The tape does not keep the magnet in place. I guess I am just not happy with this item.
5,the key to self knowledge is in this book,".The lessons in the book, as I see them, are following your intuition; learning who you really are, and the aspects of your personality that are holding you back.Self-knowledge is vital to success in life and this book helps you begin to learn who you are, truly; Not who you think you are."
3,Replacement for my first copy - Shakti's first edition,"After loaning my original copy of this book to a friend without its return, I have to say I was quite excited about this book's arrival! Upon ordering I was under the mistaken impression that the only change to the book was the artwork on the cover, however after reading the first chapter I realized this was not the case. Much to my chagrin Ms. Gawain has taken a second look and changed many things. Suffice it to say, my initial enthusiasm at returning this book to my library has diminished and I will continue my search for the first version."
3,Highland Cousins,"This is not, I repeat not your normal Highland Romance Noval. I would call it more Dickeness than anything. As I bought the Kindle edition I could not find a publishing date. It was published in England and I tell you a worse case of Editing, spelling, typos I have never found in and ebook!!!! If you can force yourself to decipher your way through this book there is an interesting enough story of unrequiented love, deception, madness etc. What did help redeem the book was it's excellent decription of country, morals, fashion of the era of early 19 Century Scotland. It was a long, long Novel to plow through, but the ending was satisfactory enough. For you die hard readers who want some meat in your novels, and not just a short bit of fluff you wiill like this well enough, if you have determination to ignore/decipher the typos. Bodice Ripper lovers, save your money, this is not for you!!"
3,Good audio performance - Average overall performance,"I use this with a host of other equipment (Samsung plasma 50"", D-Link Wireless Player, Toshiba DVD Player and Bose AM-15). I had to upgrade from my previous reciever (Pioneer VSX-D509S) only because I needed HDMI switching. I am a huge fan of this Pioneer power house.By the way, the STR-DG1000 came highly recommended to me. My experience so far has been average. As far as audio is concerned, the performance is amazing. However menu interface is terrible, user manual is poorly written and remote lacks codes for most of common devices such as satellite TV's reciever. Also for the devices for which you find the codes, most of the buttons do not work. I end up using multiple remotes.I'd stay with a Pioneer or Onkyo."
5,"""A real eye opener!!!""","Levy's superb book will sharpen your perceptions, heighten your awareness, broaden your vision, and make you laugh along the way! Woven throughout the book is Levy's message that our ears and eyes must become attuned to the various pitches of human language and behavior -- that if we hear and see only from one level, we will miss wht is essential. After reading TOOLS OF CRITICAL THINKING, things never again appear the same."
5,Hagerty Silver Foam is superb!,"I would recommend this product to anyone who loves silver jewelry. I have used a lot of different cleaners and/or polish cloths and none work as easily as this foam, and with a lot less elbow grease!!! You just lather your pieces then rinse.... It is amazing how shiny they become in seconds!"
4,Mr. Bob,"Very sturdy! The only problem I found is the opening for the two (2) barrels.I bought my standard size barrels at HOME DEPOT, as did most of my neighbors. The opening is too tight to fit the two (2) barrels in comfortably. They have to be jammed in! If the dimensions were changed to 44""L x 24""W x 26""H it would be much more acceptable to the barrels we use. I understand it would raise the cost of the cart, but I would pay the difference for a replacement and buy another cart from you if the dimensions were changed, instead of looking for another brand at a different location. Just a thought, Bob Smith"
4,door alarm,Looks like it is cheaply made but it actually works well. easy to use and install. would buy this product again.
2,"okay, but door feature is terrible","The alarm is definitely loud, no doubt about that. However, I wanted a cheap (which this is) alert alarm for my front door to wake me up if an intruder opens the door. The door aspect of this alarm is two metal prongs that, if separated, will sound the alarm. You stick the prongs in between the door and door jam to set the alarm. The problem is, the prongs want to push itself out of the door, you will need to have a very tight fit between your door and door jam to hold this in place. So, I have false alarms as a result. Also, there is no good way to disable the alarm without taping the prongs together. So, answering the door takes a minute or two. I'm going to get a motion sensing alarm instead...."
1,Defamation of God's Character,"Whether you are a ""Bible Banger"" or just a regular Joe looking for some simple guidance and truths in the questions many teenagers face, this book's answers absolutely do not offer any sound guidances, simply because the author does not understand the characteristics of God. God is not just loving but HE is absolutely Holy, meaning that HE is the absolute purity and one who is Just. To say that God doesn't care about what is right or wrong is simply the most ridiculous statements I've heard 'cause that mocks the intelligence of the teen readers. To say such thing, it binds us to the moral dillemma where we cannot decide such thing as whether the Columbine High School incident is right or wrong, or what Hitler did was right or wrong... if you think through a little bit more, the author's logics are filled with contradictions."
1,Satanic!,"This book is misleading! There is a true Christian book that follows the Bible to a ""T"" called, ""In Conversation with God - Meditations for each day of the year."" written by Francis Fernandez. Do not confuse Walsch's writings with the writings of Fernandez! Why would anyone support a book that states there is no right or wrong, or that the ten commandments were not authored by God? Just those two statements alone scares the heck out of me! This book deserves a toss in the garbage heap! It's no wonder that homeschooling is increasing 15% annually. This is some of the stuff that is being taught in our schools and parents are not going to put up with it any longer! This is truly the work of satan! Thank God most of the reviewers here feel the same as I do! Do not buy this book!"
1,Awful Book,Actually I rate it a -10. I believe the author forget to do one very important thing before he started working on this book. He did no research. He should have studied the BIBLE!!!!!!!
4,"Written for teens, not adults-give this book a chance","First and foremost, this book is written by Neale Donald Walsch-a highly respected adult author. I have all three of his books in a series called ""Conversations With GOD, An Uncommon Dialogue"". In this book, he has tried to communicate with teens, but the adults who took it upon themselves to read it, have grossly misjudged what Neale was trying to accomplish. This is a book for teens, folks - give them a chance to read it and review it themselves, without all your biased opinions being forced on them."
4,Get Your Facts Straight,"The title of this book is ""Conversations With God"", not ""Conversations With Some Words Some Guys Wrote Down a Few Thousand Years Ago That Passes Itself Off as the Word Of God"" or ""Conversations with Man-Made Religions"" We may believe the Bible is the inspired word of God but we don't know that it is. We may believe we know the will of God but we don't. All this book does is to give teenagers pause to think about what is good for them and what is bad. The same way that I believe a real diety would react, not with the writings in a book as vague as the Bible. A real diety does not need to be worshiped the way the Bible portrays but One to be served in the interests of mankind."
1,Don't bother,"The information in this book is freely available on the Internet and in most net magazine articles. The binding and presentation of the book is also of very amateur quality. Save your money and visit a search engine site like Google. In fact if you do this, you will find the web pages that the material in this book is taken from!"
2,Search and find,"Accolades to Searching the Internet by Daz Pettus for translating some fundamental and essential terms about the net that had me puzzled. It's a ""top drawer"" presentation of basic facts and savvy solutions for this net-impaired novice. Thanks for helping me to get more comfortable surfing in cyberspace."
4,Have had one 3 yrs,No complaints at all it does what it states and easy clean up. I however have had one 3 yrs and have used it less then a dozen times.
2,I must disagree,"To say that this album is as good as any Black Uhuru album just isn't true. in my opinion, the only post Michael Rose uhuru album worth mention is probably Now, mainly because of the great Don Carlos. Just my opinion, bless up!"
5,Como was actually a hip guy in the 30's...,"Can you believ a nose can swing, well it's true Como may sing through his nose, but what a beautiful noise his nose makes, and his nose really swings on these great sides with Ted Weem's hot swing band. Como who would later become a square guy in the 50's and 60's was a real hipster in the 30's, heck he even sounds black, on ""You Can't Pull The Wool Over My Eyes,"" Como has a graet sense of swing and really shows potentail to be a great jazz singer, very good CD. Recommended for those who think como wasn't a great singer, you will be surprised how truly wonderful he can be... Highly recommended"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"New colony gets a transportation industry leg-up on the old bastiches on Earth.The inhabitants of Mars have to deal with trying to build a society how they want, and not in the old way that has been done before. This requires a lot of politicking and brainstorming.They also have to deal with the usual greedy types that covet their resources and technology back where they came from."
3,"Too much, too little developed","This the first book by Greg Bear that I have read, and I was fairly disappointed. What kept me reading was that there were parts that were tantalizingly good, but the overall book didn't really fulfill the promise. I felt that Bear had several good themes that I wanted to see developed more. Given the other reviews here and what I saw in this novel, I will try Greg Bear again, but this story left me feeling that he had just touched on several ideas that I would have liked to read much more about."
3,"Promises a lot, but disappointing","Does not cover enough of most of the basic applications. As an example, the section on mail applications - very briefly touched on POP3/SMTP setup, and does not guide the reader through the creation of a mail database from beginning to end. They assume you already know most of the basic things, although the introduction claims that the book would be a good introduction for a manager with a non-Notes background.The section on LotusScript would be helpful for a beginner.This book attempts to cover everything in ONE book, but it might have been more effective to do it in two volumes, or perhaps the publisher should include the earlier edition (4.5) on the CDROM(s)."
5,great tripod,"The tripod is quite good. It's a little on the heavy side, but I think it's worth it. It's very sturdy in all conditions. I've used it as a light stand w/ an umbrella on it, and it holds up just fine in a decent amount of wind.I'd recommend this to anybody."
5,Great Book,I had a golden retriever who lived to the ripe old age of 13. He was the perfect puppy and dog. I used this book 13 years ago but had miss-placed my copy so I bought it again to use with my new puppy. I'm sure he'll turn out just as well-behaved thanks to the advice found in this book.
4,Happy,Works well. I am happy with purchase. Great price! The only thing I could possibly ask for is colors other than black.
4,excellent range,"It seems to work fine, but it's hard to say more than that.Pretty small diameter, not sure if that makes a diff."
2,"Eh, I guess sometimes you really do get what you pay for.","I purchased this cable to use to hook up my laptop to our television. It's been over a year & a half since I purchased it, and quite honestly, I'd forgotten I ever had - I tossed this cable in the garbage months ago because after the first few uses, it just didn't carry the picture correctly, and the slightest movement made things worse. I didn't use it that often so it was really a bummer."
1,15 Foot HDMI,All i have to say about this order is some how it was cancel and i didnt do that thank you i order a replacement
4,Thomas Newman strikes again,"Thomas Newman's soundtracks rarely disappoint, and this is no exception. A unique and successful combination of gamelan elemts and electronic innovation, with an arabic flavor."
3,Does the job,"I own a firearms training business and ordered these for a Force-On-Force training program that we have started. Once they arrived, I had someone shoot me while I was wearing one to see how well the performed. I could still feel a slight sting where I was hit but it wasn't anything that would cause a bruise or welt. The projectiles used were ""Battle Dust"", a .43 caliber, dry powder filled type of paintball. The impacts were taken at close range (approximately 5') and left indentations where they impacted the vest.On initial inspection it seems like they are fairly well made, with no apparent loose threads, etc. Sizing is a bit tricky for us though, as one of my staff is around 6' 2"" tall and approximately 300 lbs. While the vest fit me perfectly, he was another story.I may end up permanently attaching the rear attachment points in the near future on one of the vests to see if that works out a little better for our needs."
5,A Must Read,"I agree 100% with the prior review regarding this book. I found the bios of the athletes so compelling. Years later I was visiting the cemetery where my great aunt had recently been buried and I passed a row of tall grave stones. I read the names not expecting to know anyone but the names jumped out at me and suddenly I realized who they were. So many years later recalling this story still brings tears to my eyes. Yet the Olympics still refuses to offer a minute of silence in their memory - heaven forbid they wouldn't want to offend the terrorist nations who planned, financed and justified this barbaric, unspeakable crime. As an additional note, I was in the World Trade Center on 9/11 so I have witnessed and experienced the horror of terrorism first hand."
2,Through the Eyes of the GRU,"After reading this book, I was struck with its lack of content.Mr. Lunev had an interesting life in the GRU, though I'm sure his description would be somewhat less positive. Nevertheless, this book gives us a good idea of what drives a defector to seek asylum --- dissatisfaction.More than anything, this book is an insight not so much into what was and is going on in the old Soviet Union as what is going on inside Mr. Lunev. If you take the information he offers and move on to the next resource, you will find it a useful minor reference in the search for the truth."
1,Do not buy it unless u try it first,"I got one such scanner. Unluckly, it just does NOT work under my WinXP and Win2K. I am computer major background and I tried all the ways I can think of, without any success. It awlays gives error ""Scanner Not Found"", and let me check the USB cable, power cable, etc. If you google it: ScanMaker 3630 ""Scanner Not Found"", you will find that a number of people seem to have this problem. I emailed some of them, and those reply confirm me that they finally give it up. You can see that those discussions of how to make this scanner working, all end up with nothing. The tips on the Microtek web site are just too simple and not working also.It is said the scanner may work on some machines.So my suggestion is: try it on your PC before buy it. If it works, it is a nice buy. If not work, try something else."
2,videostudio,"This program is bad. It has ok editing features but after i captured something and said stop capturing, the program did not let me capture more but only edit. Don't use this program. Period."
2,pixel chix cottage,i have the pixel chix cottage. the games are just plain easy and her clothes are ugly she will stump her foot if you you don't play with her. when i was on vacation i left my pixel chix at my house and when I came back she moved out and ghosts haunted the cottage. iam at the age to no that this is just plain boring. youger kids might get dissaointed and sad if there pixel chix leaves. trust don't get them this get them a tamagochi there are way more fun and they don't cost as much.
4,got the pixel chix cottage,"This is a really cute game and I really like it. I got as a gift but my 4 yr old really likes playing with it. I've been playing with my pixel for about a week. The only problem is each time I put her to bed I loose every thing cat, dog, clothes and memory ect./ect. So if I put her down and pick it back up in like 10 mins. I have to hit reset start from the beginning. I don't know anyone who ownes one. I'm not sure if I got a messed up one or if they all do that."
3,re:what is this thing?,"i was wondering what this is?also is it a good toy for 13 year old?I was thinking of getting on but i dont know.i really dont like the animal pet ones but i dont know if i will like this one.well will some one write back thank you,Ipod Lover"
2,Hmmm....,"Good things about this Bluetooth Adapter:1. It's tiny2. It's got a cap to protect the USB end3. It's got a cool little LED4. It's kind of shiny5. It techincally works6. Best Buy will take it as a returnBad things about this Bluetooth Adapter1. It makes me wax nostolgic about our family's original computer: which had a whopping 4 Megahertz (i.e., the adapter is REALLY slow)2. It is not even SORT of plug-n-play - there's not a lot of software to load, but you have to load software from a CD.So although I can say more good things about the product than bad, I think that the items under ""bad"" are a bit more important. I suppose if you're only transferring tiny files through the Bluetooth adapter it will work just fine...otherwise look for something else!"
2,"Writing a LIfe: Teaching Memoir to Sharpen Insight, Shape Meaning--and Triumph Over Tests",This book was not what I expected. It deals with writing in schools and has very little use for the writing and group I facilitate.
3,okay album,"Petey Pablo ""Raise it Up"" and the remix was in rotation all over the country and was a tight summer hit. After hearing him on Mystikal's last album, Brat's last album and Whoa RMX, I thought this album would be an album of the year but after hearing the album it is basically a let down. The Source gave it 4 mics but This album is okay. The beats are tight but the lyrics are okay. The album starts off straight with ""Petey Pablo"", ""Raise Up"" and I. ""Didn't I""is okay. "". ...Last couple of song he sounds like a Southern Ja rule with the singing. So basically the beats make the album because some songs he ain't talking about nothing but a bunch of ..."
4,A must have,"I first heard this on the radio in my home state of NC at first where of course the single ""Raise up"" was blowin up, playin every 5 minutes on the radio. I heard it and said whoa this dude's gotta pretty good flow plus he's from nc I'll give it a try"". I didn't regret it and I'm sure you won't either. While the timbaland producing might lead you to think this is his project, it's not. Petey more than holds his own over his own beats. Almost 2 years after it came out, it's still one the albums I can put in the car and everyone loves it. If you can pick it up, I recommend doin so. The hit Raise Up will no doubt take you back to summertime when you heard it and the rest of the album will show you why petey is a force that's up and coming."
1,WACK,THIS ALBUM IS WACK. I THINK THAT PETEY SHOULD HAVE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD BEFORE RELEASING THIS ALBUM. ITS ONLY 2 GOOD SONGS ON THE ALBUM. ALSO TIMBALAND BEATS ARE STARTING TO GET VERY TIRED. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND AVOID
5,"Jump, jump, jump!","Another excellent release from Square One! A little something for everyone--some pan and calypso--and a number of jump up, wine back, raise ya hand, move ya waist SOCA!! A high energy album that everyone can appreciate!"
2,Wish I could return this item...,"We are very disappointed with our purchase. The chair is not as full as we expected. If an adult sits in the chair, they sink to the bottom. The ""fluff"" is chunks of foam and it's just not very full...as opposed to ""bean"" bags that kind of mold to your body and provide more support. Also, it smells like chemicals and we've been tempted to put it in the garage (I'm assuming it's the foam inside that smells?). I thought maybe after a month of airing it out the smell would go away, but it's still pretty strong. Also, due to the way the chair is packaged (vacuum sealed) the chair is VERY wrinkled. The fabric is thick and sturdy, so it is holding the wrinkles and you cannot remove the cover to wash and iron it. We have had the chair for over a month, therefore cannot return it. And, it would cost so much to return that I'd rather just eat the cost. Not what was expected."
3,just fine,"We've had this chair for almost a month. It is still a little new foam stinky. Must be fluffed often. So far, no issues with zipper or cover."
5,F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!,"This CD is a mood lifter! A sure fire cure for boredom, but be warned. . . it's a little dorky."
4,Mama Mia DVD,Overall a good DVD of the actual songs performed live at the play. Felt like I was back in the theatre watching it with the same excitement the music presents. A good value for the money.
5,Thank You For the Music,"Even if you did not see the Broadway Production, the soundtrack to Mama Mia! by The Universal Music Company will keep you rocking through the night with some of ABBA's greatest hits of the 70's. If you are an ABBa fan, you will definately love this CD. The songs on this CD also have short clippings from the musical which also make it fun.Some of the songs featured on this soundtrack are Mama Mia, Dancing Queen, Super Trouper, Chiquitita, and 20 other great hits. No matter what year you were born, these upbeat songs will for sure keep you happy and will help you relax when you are not in a very good mood."
2,not much info,"the only good in this book is that the language is easy and artwork is good. it looks that author has copied info from somewhere and pasted it in little easier form.this book contains info only from mythology (fantasy), it doesnt give evidence or info on wether these mythical creatures really existed or till now exists, whether someone saw them or not. really wastage of money. this book is slightly overpriced also.the title says invite thier powers, but believe me there is no method as to how to invite these creatures or attract them.i recommend u 'a wizard's bestiary' from oberon zell. this is much better book, contains all info in this book as well and lots of info and facts whether they really existed or not. and reasonably priced. and artwork is much more than this."
5,Remarkable First Novel,"Donahue's inaugural offering, The Stolen Child, is a wonderful tale of the changeling and the child, offered in alternating chapters from each's point of view. Set in modern-day America, the mundane aspects of life make the familiar cultural references enhance the fantastic. The real made the unreal seem more compelling and tangible.I thorough enjoyed the book, and read its 319 pages in a single afternoon one lazy Sunday. It's a compelling tale, and one that is easy to get into and finish fairly quickly."
1,Horrible book - don't bother.,"I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting. I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected. It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children. Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending. My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money."
3,The Stolen Child,"I am only in the 3rd Cd so far and I have enjoyed it so much that I have missed my exit 2-3 times going to work/home. Totally engrossed in it.I wish I could get Clive Barker's ""The Thief of Always"" on audio CD."
3,Okay read,"I thought this book was okay; it's nowhere near the best I've ever read, but nowhere near the worst either."
5,The Stolen Child,"Do you ever wonder what happens to every missing child in the US, well this book is one possibility. While this book isn't scary it does make you think twice when you see a shadow that looks out of place. The Stolen Child is a great teen read, but it is very close to being a supped-up fairy tale. The book is great but the ending leaves a lot to be desired. If you start reading you won't be able to but this book down until you finish it. The highs and lows of both Henry and Aniday keep you grasping for a deeper understanding of how they live and think. I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends, family, and pets if they knew how to read.RomNE 7/8"
4,"Fairy Tale is Dark, Multi-Faceted, and Moving","Don't be fooled by the fairytale-like premise of this novel - there is a lot more going on here than the exchange of humans for changelings. In fact, you may question what makes us human at all by the time you're done with this fascinating book. Donohue did an amazing job creating the sympathetic and sometimes pathetic ancient children and showing his readers the importance of not wasting the life we are given."
3,Not for the fantasy lover.,"I'm a huge fantasy fan, and had decided I would try something completely outside my normal circles. (Think Martin, Jordan, Brooks, Butler, Haydon, etc...) so I looked at Amazon's top 10 current fantasy best sellers. This book has been #1 for what, almost 2 months now? If you love fantasy, you will find this book nearly unreadable. Yes it is very well written and articulated, but is more remeniscent of Oprah's book club than fantasy. Don't be fooled by the characters, this book is for people who want to learn some deeply hidden truth about themselves or the universe and has nothing to do with hobgoblins or magic. If your looking for enlightenment this might be a good choice. If your looking for entertainment I would look elsewhere."
2,another person tricked into a bad purchase,"After reading some of the other reviews I must admit I agree this is not a very well written book also. Lots of hype regarding the book, as well as Amazon even sticking the advertising on the side of the box it was mailed in (should have known then).This is a long book and I could not feel any connection to the characters either. Odd names to remember or pronounce and since I could not feel anything for them I could not remember who was who. Overall this was an extreme disappointment that left me feeling as if I wasted my time finishing it.The concept was great and could have been a really fun read as well as making some statement about humanity or whatnot. Somewhere the fantasy was lost and the reality to ordinary to matter."
3,"The ""greatness"" of this book never appeared.","Though the story of this book is unique, the execution of the story left a lot to be desired. The author should have explained why there was ever an exchange or theft in the first place. The details of ""why & how"" children are stolen/transformed were missing. Early on in the tale, the faeries became very human-like,which made the story loose its appeal. I was hoping for a really great read or at least a great ending; neither happened for me. This book is ambitious but it is not great. Because the premise of the story is so far-fetched, I think the readers have overrated this book. I never warmed up to any of the characters. I didn't care what happened to them once I finished the book. Reading The Stolen Child was just not that enjoyable."
3,it was ok,"i think she did pretty good for her first cd, but i think it could have been better. the only track that i really felt was Brighter Day, everything else was ok. i don't play the cd that much and the reason i bought the cd was because i wanted to see how she arranged You Brought The Sunshine and i wasn't to thrilled with that track either"
3,This time they were OK.,"I was horrified when I discovered that I had ordered the 15 oz boxes of Milk Bone dog treats again. I had promised myself I would only get the smaller boxes, because last year when I ordered these 15 oz boxes from this same seller and stored them in a plastic container for less than a month I discovered that they were populated with ugly little meal worms and webbing! It was so awful I ended up throwing out the entire container. After some discussion where the seller did not want to credit my account, Amazon took the bull by the horns and got my credit back. This time, I have carefully inspected the boxes and this batch of 15 oz seem to be OK. So we will use them, but next time I will make sure I purchase the smaller (10 oz) boxes of Milk Bone treats or even the large 40 oz plastic tubs which have always been fine, because the prior experience with 15 oz was awful. My advice - Just check them out carefully!"
4,Pixel Chix.,I have not got a Pixel Chick yet but my sister has got one and it looks really good.I am getting a Beverly Hills Mansion for my 9th birthday.The only problem is we can't get the Pixel Chix Car to connect to the Pixel Chix House. If anyone knows how to please reply.From Leigh :-)
3,Its ok,"Well, I really enjoy this! I got the Bevely Hills Mansion. It is really fun. But the problem is when you dont play with it for a while she gets mad and cobwebs show up. Soon shell just move out. When mine moved out she made a face at me, a ghost haunted my house, and I lost my memory. My sisters toy is going to be taken back because of battery problems. She can play with hers for a while, but soon it will just black out. I think that the company needs to fix the glitches befor they sell anymore. Parents- I think this toy is appropriate but it needs work."
5,Great Music!,"I came late to the Lost Dogs, having purchased their ""Best Of"" first, and enjoying many of the songs, but not necessairly being blown away. What brought me back to the Dogs was a Daniel Amos CD ""Mr. Buechner's Dream"". That double Cd is one of the best albums I have ever heard. So, wanting more of that type of music, I checked out Terry Taylor's other group again. This CD is excellent. It seems to be more in the vein of country-folk than the earlier Lost Dogs CD's, but there is beautiful music here. ""Real Men Cry"", and ""The Mark of Cain"" are slow, reflective, thoughtful, and lovely. There are fun songs too, but with meaning, such as ""Dust on the Bible"" the one song on the disc not written by Taylor. Taylor has frequently been called the best songwriter in Contemporary Christian music, but that's too limiting. He paints visual images that linger. Soothing and thoughtful music."
2,Toaster oven cookbook,"I received the book yesterday and must say I am disappointed. Many of the recipes are not very specific regarding amounts, weights, etc., something that should be basic information available in every cookbook. For instance, the author writes about baking a chicken, to cut a chicken in half (or quarters), to bake it, but as everyone knows chickens can range from 3 to 5 or 6 pounds or more. So which it is? This might not be critical information for a conventional oven but is crucial for the small size of a toaster oven. There are too many dessert recipes, in my opinion. Overall, I find this book to be very amateurish and a very disappointing purchase for me, as an avid cookbook collector and experienced cook."
1,Bottom end product,"I bought two of these through Amazon. The delivery was on time and the product shipped successfully. However, buyers should be aware that there is a reason this is a low-priced product. It is fairly flimsy, the parts did not actually have all the required holes drilled for assembly, and the directions are just a one-page picture. I got them together and they do the job. However, if this is an important purchase for you, try to find a higher-quality product if you can."
1,For Square Heads,"The first thing I noticed is that the earpieces do not move so if your head is any less than 8 inches across the earpieces do not sit flat on your ear (think 75 degree angle against your head). That, and the sound quality is only average. I am returning them."
5,An adventure novel with deeper truths,"I just finished reading Svaha for perhaps the 6th time. Each time I read it, I get more from the book. While it is a super book to read if you want to experience a post-apocalyptic adventure story, if you read it for that alone, you're missing so much. The mixture of Native American and Japanese cultures, the struggle between honor, duty and the need for change, all of these combine to create a world of teaching."
2,It was not worth the money.,I found this book to be lacking in several areas and was deeply disappointed not only in the content but in the exorbinant amount of money I paid for what was really a large phamplet. The book focused on how to organize the business with page after page description of their forms being the majority of the book. Starting the pet service and helpful tips and hints were briefly covered in what I believe was a basic and common sense format rather than informative and concise. I would not have had such a poor response to the book if it had been properly described as a source of forms and outline for managing your business and if the cost weren't so high
5,SmoothJazz.com Review,"Fans of Paul Hardcastle are going to love Phil Casagrande's brand new single ""The Inspector (dub mix)."" A fun, upbeat tune with a little Miami Vice action thrown in for good measure... this exhilarating, sunny track is one of the latest to roll out of the Casagrande Studios in NYC, along with another lovely, inspiring song reminiscent of a chilled Bob James piece, called ""Let's Groove."" Composer, pianist, producer, Phil Casagrande is an all terrain vehicle when it comes to creating music... always has been going back to his days of writing chart-topping songs for Atlantic Records (Starlight Records) to his current studio work with leading contemporary artists in pop and rap along with his own unique Smooth Jazz compositions."
4,Much better than the first.,"Sasha was the new girl in town. She met Kate, Cooper, and Annie at an Equinox gathering. She seemed to be starved for acceptance, love, and friendship. She was hard to trust though. After all, she had stolen Annie's spell book and did a spell to steal Scott away from Kate.Soon the three find out that Sasha's whole life story was all lies ... and why.**** In my opinion, book two was much better than the first. It left me with high hopes that the third will be great too! The only thing I did not like was that the book stopped suddenly and left me hanging. I much prefer no cliff hangers when I close a book. However, the story flowed smoothly and the author beautifully described the changes in Kate's life, as well as, how Kate matures. Kate is not my favorite character of the series though. I am hoping I get to see some stories in view-points from Annie or Cooper soon. ****"
3,A good book,"This is a good series but the Sweep series and the Immortals are better. And it will take a lot to beat Charmed and Buffy. I picked them up at the book store, all three and read them. The romance was nice but I thought from the descriptions I had read that the books would have more humor and be a little more real. But if you finished reading all your favorites then these are good to fill in while your waiting for your next book in your favorite series. I also recommend the fearless series. Nothing can top those books."
3,Boring yet less magickal~~~~~~~~,Okay okay wasnt as good but da circle was cool in a way and Sashas messedLataJem
3,Revelation,"Few will deny that Paul Tillich's theology is powerful and moving. However, it may seem necessary after reading this book to bifurcate it completely from his personal life. Hannah Tillich's accounts of their adventures (so to speak) remind one of Sartre and Beauvoir's - and that is not a good thing. I will not say much about the details here, but suffice it to say that it is somewhat shocking to read for the first time if one is used to putting theologians on pedestals as dignified, upstanding and moral men both in their personal and public lives. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Tug of war,"""Pride and Prejudice"" is about integrity as personified in Elizabeth Bennett.""Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman"" is about a decent, intelligent, and very wealthy Mr. Darcy who has built his life within a defensive stockade of formality and exclusiveness.Then he stumbles across Elizabeth Bennett who threatens his defenses while she challenges his whole comfortable cocoon of existence. He can't get her out of his head, and then she takes over his impregnable heart and leaves him gasping and struggling to re-engage his logic, and logic fails.We get to go along and experience the metamorphoses through each stage of Darcy's battle to defend his cocoon.Meanwhile, Elizabeth goes solidly unimpressed with his grandeur; beautiful, distant, poised, and loving. And beneath him.We know how it ends. What we didn't know before was how Darcy got there.Jane Austen would approve."
5,"FItzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy",I loved reading this triolgy. Jane Austen did an amazing job of fleshing out the Bennet family and Pamela Aidan did the same with Mr Darcy & those close to him. I would recommend these engaging books to anyone who loves P&P.
4,Darcy's Point of View... Well Done!,"This book is a great addition to any library, and especially to those who cherish Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. It is well written for the most part, although there are moments where you kind of wonder how well the author read through P&P;, because the 'timing' doesn't seem to match up well, and there is some literary license taken with reference to the well established expressions of certain characters (again, doesn't match up with P&P;)....Overall, it was really well done, and so amazing to see the 'inner workings' of Mr. Darcy, a character who we previously never knew until the end of P&P...;."
3,"worth reading, but don't expect it to be Jane Austen","This book is fun to read, and let's you revisit and rethink Pride and Prejudice. However, it's written in a totally different style, sometimes neat (interesting historical or cultural details), and sometimes not (writing is good but not peerless like Austen)."
1,"What a bunch of crooks, I dare you to print this...","What is fun about a bunch of robbers ????? When Greed is taught in our Colledges, we have'nt a chance to do what is right....unless we start to think for ourself....Do what is RIGHT.. Do not listen to the lies of the Politicians,Question your educators untill you know they are telling the truth and Lord help us you know when that is..."
2,alpine trailblazer review,"I purchased this book based on the reader reviews of 5 stars.I was very disappointed in the book. Number 1 fault...NO MAPS.Not even a rough drawing of any trails. I'm a map freak when it comes to hiking. Trail descriptions were sketchy and vague.This book is fine if your looking for brief overviews of areas to hike, bike and kayak. But, if your even a moderate hiker or backpacker, this book won't cut the mustard for all the information that you'll need for a good and safe hike.I've ordered a few Falcon Book hiking guides from amazon.com, and have used them on several hikes. The info and trail descriptions are very good with moderatly detailed maps for each hike."
2,Tea and Lack of Sympathy (or should that be vinegar?),"Cooley writes as though she lived this story and relates well the emotions behind it. Although I often get caught up in the lives of the characters I read about and think about them when I'm not reading the book, I could not sympathize with any of these characters. I wanted to scream at Alice: ""Bad things happen - get over it. Run as far from Madeline as you can"". Overall, women were portrayed as neurotic and men as users. I also felt the author (I know it was fiction but still...) did not pay much attention to detail and the story line was inconsistent. She had the Wizard of Oz first airing on TV in 1949 and I believe it was actually in the late 50's. The parts about the midnights drives and sharing clothes were also choppy. A much better book is ""Was"" by Geoff Ryman which also explores the themes of home and family and Judy Garland's life but is a much smoother read."
4,a wonderfully woven story...,"Julie Garwood is a master story teller and this book will certainly not disappoint. You come to love Judith and her deep bond with her best friend, Frances. I felt that Judith was a wonderful heroine and much more true and believable than many of Garwood's others. You come to care for Judith and Iain, and this is a special love story."
5,I LOVE Julie garwood..,"This book is wonderful! Starting with a story of a close friendship, including everything from gory childbirth details to the intimacies of true love, this book leaves you with a content smile and a heartfelt sigh. If only real life were this romantic..."
2,Very predictable,And felt like a YA book. Held my interest ok but I called about everything that happened ahead of time. The romance was a bit over the top for my preference as well
4,"Mostly good, but...dead wrong on corn","I shuddered when I saw the back cover with the picture of the chinchilla eating corn. According to the breeder from whom I bought our chinchilla, CORN CAN CAUSE FATAL BLOATING IN CHINCHILLAS. I even saw the painful effects of corn on a female chinchilla (she had to be euthenized). Most of the information in the book is solid, but the book lost credibility with me on this issue."
3,Not bad once it gets going,"I bought mine in 2006. Started right up and continues to do so BUT until it gets warmed up, it keeps shutting down with a LOW OIL alarm. The oil level is fine, I even over filled it once just to make sure. Caused a big mess and STILL shut down, showing LOW OIL. I just learned to live with it."
1,Doesn't Compare Well with Other Brands,"I tried this brand for the first time, having already used some other brands. I didn't feel this product was as moist as others I have used and that it had a medicinal smell whereas other brands have a more pleasant smell. It is definitely too dry. There are better alternatives out there."
4,the new (REAL)deal,"yo dudes! i saw this band open for the roots in philly and i liked their style. so i went and copped the album. dude it's freaking awesome. this is like techno but its totally live band man. if u like new stuff with a edge try the new deal. some of thier funk was like whoa! and their like some canadain dork guys too! the keyboard cat is awesome in concert. the way he moves his head and hands to songs like reciever is like ""uh""? . the bass player rocked a long wig (it was halloween) and the drummer was a classic white boy in Gap wear. yo dude i paid (money) for the cd (and i'm cheap as hell) so u know it rocks. buy it NOW."
3,"Good, but live cd is better","Really interesting sound. I love the fact that they are not using pre-recorded tape, but compared to the live offerings it is not as good. Worth picking up though if you already have the Live."
3,"Great Songs, Bad Recording Quality","Just a quick comment for those before they purchase this CD. I own this and the 16 greatest hits cd, some of the same tracks appear on both of these but they sound much better on the not remastered versions. The songs however and voice of Jeannie Kendall are phenomenal, just too bad the sonic quality takes away from this a bit."
3,hand soap dispenser,"This dispenser is not a bad investment for the hand powdered soap like boraxo or twenty mule, although it is made cheap. The inside bracket that holds the cover on is spot welded and not holding itself to the outer box very well. I had to do some up grade on it. I removed the rivets from the outer shell and lifted the inside so I can revit the bracket holding the cover to keep it secure, other than that it is a neat dispenser. I would recommend it."
3,Comprehesive but dry,"Everything you need to know, but hard reading as extremely dry text. Plenty of problems to work through, but no worked examples or answers. Large appendix section full of helpful tables of properties"
3,Blue Oyster Cult's 2 songs are killer!,"The soundtrack ""Bad Channels"" is just that, a soundtrack to a stupid movie. BOC's 2 songs ""Demon's Kiss"" and ""The Horsemen Arrive"" are just killer. ""The Horsemen"", is the crown jewel. BOC did instrumentals for 18 songs, nothing groundbreaking. The rest of the soundtrack is second rate bands I really didn't care for. It would be another 6 years before hearing anything new by BOC again."
4,Fine Piano Player,"DD Jackson plays piano with heart and soul. I know, that's a cliche, but it's true. The Welcoming is uptempo and full of life. Romanza is exactly what it promises with the title. Summer was so beautiful, I had to listen to it several times before I could move on. Not many jazz pianists can move me like that. Bill Evans comes to mind. D.D. captures life with sound. What more can a listener ask for?Give this talented musician a listen. You won't be disappointed."
2,Corruption in Police is complex,"The budget for making this movie went for feeding the production crew and little else. Having said that I can only remark that watching cars drive across the screen from afar can only be done so many times before you realize it is just a time filler/killer. The development of personalities slowly leads to a confrontation that left me saying, ""So what?"". If your goal is to witness the hopelessness of life in eastern Europe, then this is for you. The movie leaves you depressed and glad at the same time. Depressed for the lives of those people who inspired this movie. And, glad that it is over and you do not have to watch it again."
1,Wouldn't work,"It appears to be a nice clock, but I think I got a lemon. The alarm would not sound no matter what I tried. I had to return it."
5,"As entertaining as Fox network's ""24""","Double bluff is an utterly involving, intricately woven, thrill-a-minute, crime mystery akin to the television program ""24."" And just like that program, it all takes place in the space of 24 hours (well, just a few more).Like ""24,"" Double Bluff doesn't go into much detail about the characters, and some readers might feel that the author could have added a little more detail. But that would have slowed the breakneck pace of the book.While I wouldn't want every book I read to take this approach -- just as I wouldn't want every television show I watch to be ""24"" -- a book like Double Bluff is a great change of pace and a real adrenaline rush. I heartily recommend it."
5,Thinking About Everyday Racism,"I found this book to be both informative and enlightening. Through this book, I was made aware that there is more everyday racism than I thought. It's very sad to know that this is still going on. Our country is so great because we are all different and can share our thoughts and customs with each other. What a boring world this would be if everyone was the same. This is a book that should be read by everyone."
4,Liked it,My husband got this movie and loved it. He stated it was very good at explaining Hallowen traditions
4,Great movie,"Loved it, great entertaining movie. Keeps you on the edge. Looking for tick r treat 2. Some sexual content was not needed to make the movie great."
1,Garbage!,Garbage. I thought after the many positive reviews this would be good. It was very bad. Skip it!
3,Good action thriller for halloween,"The movie itself was good, not the best , but good, it definetly gives you variety of monsters on halloween. Also the plot is played out in a great way. I love it when they back track a few different ways/views based on the characters evens thoughtout the movie . There are some bloody parts in it, but nothing to overdone. I would say the school bus driver definitly has it the best in the movie. There are also some good sexy girl scenes, nothing R-rated from what i can remember. It's a movie I would always watch during the Halloween time, like some many others!!!"
2,Mediocre,"This was a dull horror movie. It doesn't help that there isn't a whole lot of horror in this film to begin with, no real scares (not even cheap ones) and its rather light on the gore and whats there is mundane by modern standards. This movie seemed like an attempt at a strictly Halloween themed version of Creep Show and with the typical EC Horror comics stylings, but it ends up stylistically and content wise having more in common with kiddie stuff like Goosebumps and the old Nickelodeon show Are You Afraid of The Dark? And despite all that it is rated R for some bizarre reason.Its another example of something building up the usual amount unwarranted buzz because it was shelved for a couple of years and was released straight to dvd. I suspect that this flick still would be shelved if True Blood weren't as popular as it is. The movie is worth a rental, and only for the holiday and if you're desperate for a halloween themed flick."
1,Bad horror movie,"This movie is terrible. I love scary movies, but this was just awful. The story is bad (it's several mini-stories) and it really isn't frightening. It's more like a spoof movie except that it's not funny either."
5,"Scary, yet fun!","This show is done in the way of CREEPSHOW and TALES OF THE CRYPT. The info tells you it has four different stories that intertwine with eachother, but when I watched the show I counted five. There is the one with the kid and his evil principal, the one where the group of kids go out to pull a prank that turns around on them, the one with the virgin girl(ANNA PAQUIN) dressed up as little red riding hood who gets stalked by a murderer, the one where the girlfriend gets killed for hating halloween, and finally the one where the grumpy old man gets a surprise visit from a trick r' treating monster. Each of these stories intertwine with each other and the characters in them throughout the movie. Most of the show is horror, but they also add in some humor which makes the show fun to watch anytime of the year!A++++++++++++"
4,Totally fun Halloween movie,"This movie somewhat reminded me of reading the old Tales of the Crypt comics. A total of four or five mini stories this is a fun popcorn movie to watch with your friends on Halloween night when you have nothing else to do. Not quite scary, not to campy, and just the right amount of fun, I don't see how you pass on this movie for only $5."
4,Good movie,If you like campy horror movies on the cusp of quasi B flix then this is your kind of movie.
2,not bad....not great,"Not too bad, but kinda been done before. Camerawork and angles are pretty goodbut i found this film more angry and evil than creepy and scary.Worthy of a look.. but not a keeper."
5,LIfe Jackets as expected,These are perfect for meeting coast gaurd regolatins. Fit under my center console well. Good inexpensive solution to get out on the water.
4,Good Phone w/ Media Playback,"This is a good purchase. It came with $50 air time to start the subscription.Good durable phone.For people who desire Touch Screen phone, it is a good deal. It does not cost arms and legs! Hooray!"
2,Wide Skewers,"The products didn't turn out what I had expected. The pictures and all seemed to indicate what I wanted, which was wide skewers about 1"" side, but they turned out to be about 1/4"" wide. So, I will keep them and use them for other purposes, but they didn't turn out to what I really wanted."
3,Good but expensive ..................,Nice skewers. Sturdy and easy to clean. Rosewood handles do not let heat transmitted to the the handler.Central Chef shipped the day I bought these items and I received them in 5 days as promised - although they charged too much for the eight skewers I bought from them.
5,ACTUALLY SEEMS NEW!,"Just Perfect... can't wait to actually be in Hawaii, thanks to your book! I was pleased to find hikes that just look amazing..Fast delivery, the book appears to be new.... THANK YOU"
3,I'm a little disappointed...,"I've lived on Maui for almost 9 years, and done quite a bit of hiking and outdoors activities, so I'm familiar with may of the places and trails described. When I read through this book though, I was disappointed by the fuzziness of the directions to find trailheads.I much prefer ""Maui Revealed""!"
1,Worth $6? Maybe. Worth $6 + shipping? not a chance.,"This item was an absolute waste of money and I'm all the more irritated for having purchased it. Upon attempting to merely insert the device, the outer case of the dongle split open. What I discovered? That cute little 'antenna' doesn't actually connect to anything! It's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side!When I finally managed to get the damn thing running (the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair/connect a device) it worked fine - once. I turned off my laptop, removed the dongle, and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all.Do yourself a favor. Shell out the extra 15-20-30 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2.0 bluetooth usb adapter. Don't make this mistake."
2,software problem,"The product works, but the software that claims to be windows compatible say's it is not when installing. Caused a lot of annoying delays when installing. Set system restore point before installing. Software hasn't caused any problems yet."
4,Humerous but thought-provoking overview with great breadth,"A great read for new project managers, or project managers who have never dealt with deployment. It touched on quite a number of topics I hadn't experienced, some I hadn't considered, and did it with a light, pleasant read instead of a fall-asleep-after-five-pages approach you'd expect."
1,A Clueless scientist tries Buddhism,"Very few books have I ever torn up and tossed and this is one. 'Repititous drivel' comes to mind. Mr Targ you may not use the words 'Aristotalian logic' in each and every paragraph without insulting and ultimately losing your audience. Do we really need a bland repititious scientist to tell us what Buddhism is about? Sir, only empty headed boring scientists like yourself ever subscribed to aristotalian logic (whatever that is)to begin with."
5,Worked well,"Good: worked wellBad: noneThese worked well with my old Coleman lantern. They were bright, long-lasting, and fit nicely."
5,can not go wrong with coleman,I use these mantles for the gass lights in my off the grid camp.Usually get a couple of years out of them and they are a great value for the money.
5,Don't Rush Out to Buy It Just Yet,"This years edition of the show may have all the episodes but it's lacking in the special features department. According to the site TVSHOWSONDVD.com there will be another edition coming out in 2005. The 2005 edition will be chocked full of heavenly goodness. It is being produced with the help of the great Paul Reubens. The 2005 addition will contain all 5 seasons in one handy-dandy boxed set and will.....is everybody listening..........have audio commentary with Paul Reubens himself. Woo-hoo! If you are a hard-core fan of the show you may want to just wait till next year when the better edition is released. Until then, thanks for reading my review."
5,Pee-wee`s Playhouse#1,Fast shipping. The dvd was new and still in the packaging. It was a gift for someone else and it arrived in plenty of time for the occasion.
4,"A good followup to ""Best Of Part 1""","This Best of cd has 20 tracks and covers the albums from ""Firefly"" to ""Differant World"" it has two unreleased ""live tracks"" and three ""single edits"" and is a good followup to the first Best Of cd."
3,beautiful shoes but not very comfortable,"I purchased these shoes to match a leather bag my husband bought for my birthday. while these shoes are exactly as pictured, the size runs a bit small. I did however get a half size larger which fit but they are not very comfortable to walk in. They are beautiful though, and I still occasionally wear them.(the discomfort is a small sacrifice for the compliments I get when wearing them)"
3,It's a good idea but,"It's a good idea, but a lot easier if you just buy the same type of bones without filling and stuff them on your own with peanut butter then stick them in the freezer to harden. We've done this for my GSD for 4 or 5 months now for bed time and she loves it. We use peanut butter, cream cheese, bananas, cottage cheese, greek yogurt, etc. (anything that is SAFE for dogs that she loves). Or just reuse this bone when your dog is done..don't throw it away they are nearly indestructible!"
2,My dog isnt into these.,"So far my dog wont even touch this. I bought her the cheese and bacon bone and the peanut butter and she isnt giving them the time of day. If she changes her mind i will edit this to let everyone know. Also, these smell really gross and fake. Im kind of happy she doesnt like them as of now because of that."
3,Dog Bones,My dog loves these bones. A bone can keep him occupied for a long time. My only complaint is that they are too expensive for what you get. These bones should not be priced higher than$4.00
2,Not for my dog!,"Once my JRT mix got as much peanut butter out of this bone, she completely lost interest. Maybe it was too hard for her but she sure wasn't that into it."
3,Dogs not too interested.,They liked it tell they could not get to the peanut butter which was only 5 min after giving it to them. I expected it to be more of a treat and that it would last longer. Further more one cracked when my dog dropped it a foot to the ground first thing.
2,My dogs thought they were just OK.,I gave these bones to my dogs for Christmas. They thought they were just OK. One of my dogs is a Weim and he is big and loves to chew. He is not impressed with this bone. These bones are very hard and kind of heavy and a little messy. They might be too much for a smaller dog.
1,Wrong Pictures and price,"When I looked at the pictures and price it seemed I was receiving a great deal. A box of filled bones for $9.79. Not, it turned out to be one bone, buyer beware of what is pictured."
1,OUCH! Felt heavy on my back and reminded me of Roman armour for battle!,"This thing feels like you are wearing armour to go into battle! The last thing I needed post op was a weighted garmet pulling on my back. Perhaps useful for a weight lifter to use at night for sore muscles, but nor made for a petite female due to extreme weight"
2,Weak sound,"Bought it for my Mom who needs big buttons. But it has so weak sound, that it is practically unusable. Thanks for good Amazon return policy, it was returned and fully refunded. Would not recommend this phone."
3,It not bad,This phone works great after I had to get an additional part to make it work. The cord that goes to the phone has the wrong pins used on it and I had to go buy a new cord to make it work. Cheaper to buy the cord then send it back. Now the phone works perfect and my grandparents love it since their eye sight has gotten pretty bad.
4,Beware!!!,"La Lupe is Classic! She's a great vocalist and has great charisma BUT unfortunately the record label seemed to have screwed up the mastering on this album.On track#3 ""lo que paso paso"" after about one minute or so the sound quality on the recording just goes haywire!I know this is only done on this album as I heard the same song on another album where it sounds perfect from beginning to end. Also I have bought ""apasionada"" like 4 times in total and the same thing happens at the same spot within' the song! This is just the record label's fault.You have been warned."
2,"Redbarn Filled Bone, Cheese N'Bacon - Small",Bones are very expensive for size. I can buy twice the size for same price (and same brand)at retail stores.
3,yard flea control,"I used this product in my dog kennel after extensive cleaning. removed all dog paraphenalia and dogs. It didn'twork as good as I had hoped. before applying this, I had twice prior treated the yard and surroundng areas with spectracide granules and water and a week later with other liquid spectracide. I treated dogs with Capstar 2 days in a row and with Comfortis pills. There are still fleas in the yard after 4 wks.."
2,Not much to it...,"This is the ""modern"" paper doll, using magnets instead of paper. The dolls are actually printed metal boxes with Belle and the Beast (no Prince---my daughter constantly says ""He's ugly!"") on each side. I like the idea of a reusable item, but instead of just focusing on outfits, shoes, and such there are lot of tiny, easily lost accessories. I'm constantly finding these small pieces and I don't know how many I haven't found."
1,not thrilled,The pieces are very tiny and you are forced to stick them to the tin instead of something else because the body is only on the tin. The pieces were also very annoying to have to punch out to start with.
3,sisters to the owl?,a musician you may like if you dig trio-convulsant is Gordon Grdina... look him up! underground music is our friend! support the underdog!
3,Looks good but be aware,"Product looks good just like on the photo. It is soft and comfortable and washed really well with no wrinkles visible after drying. However, be aware that the back of the duvet cover as well as pillow cases is a different material and not microfiber. It is 100% polyester, cheap and scratchy. It does not bother me and my wife as much as we use the flat sheet as well. I was surprise that this info was omitted from the product description, but I still prefer this duvet cover to other 100% cotton models that wrinkle like crazy. No need to to wash my new silk filled comforter and I do like the look. Cannot beat the price either."
4,Review of Product,"I was skeptical after reading the negative reviews. My duvet and pillow shams had no flaws, fit as described and the colors are as shown in the photo.I am quite happy. I ordered a comforter for the duvet and the set is now complete."
3,Blossom part 2,I have been waiting blossom part2this book wrote 2007 whats the problem I check everytime I buy book from another author. I check see queen penwrote book2 What I want too know will their be part2
3,Where's Part TWO?!,"I liked the book, but its not what I thought it would be. I really wish Queen Pen will hurry up with part two...Its been about five or six years already. SMH! I need to find out what happens next."
5,This was it,What can i say.... I LOVED IT... i have found out that the sequel is suppose to hit stores this year yall...YESSSSS THE SEQUEEEL
5,Best out of Detroit in a while,"This is the best R&B artist out of Detroit in a while. If you enjoy music from artist such as the styles of Marvin Gaye and other R&B, Maurice J has it!"
1,Review,"Honestly what can you say about any of her books.I have read about 10 of her books and I tried hard to ignore that all her books are the same and not to write a review but I have just got ask, WHY does Diane Palmer always make the heroine so gullible and forgiving? Why are all her books basically the same?Not going to write a long review but summary -Judd Dunn - hero of book, total jerk through entire bookChristabel 'Crissy' Gaines - heroine, strong female but gullible and too forgiving of Judd DunnCash Grier - secondary character, bit of a jerk himself but truly a good guy, in love with CrissyTippy Moore - secondary character, she had issues and she was a jerkSPOILER (but you know the outcome anyway)Crissy and Cash should have been a couple. They had good chemistry.Judd and Tippy should have been a couple. They deserved each other."
2,Not one of Ms. Palmer's best.,"I've always been a great fan of Ms. Palmer's books since I've read them the first time 18 years ago, however, her current offering ""Lawless"" was a little disappointing. Although, the story is about Cristabel Gaines and Judd Dunn, one could get side-tracked and wished Cristabel ended up with Cash Grier. Similar to what the previous reader said, Cash Grier was more a man than Judd Dunn was.Even the secondary plot (the murder mystery) was lost in the jealousy and misunderstanding that went back and forth between Judd and Crissy.I'm looking forward to Ms. Palmer's story of Cash Grier,in the event that she does write one for him.Although, ""Lawless"" is not one of Ms. Palmer's best, her future offerings would still be greeted with much enthusiasm!!!"
3,1/2* Not my kind of book...,"My last book was Desperado when it came out in hardcover. I really got into Palmer's Long Tall Texan series several years ago before I started reading more romantic suspense. This book was much like her previous books.Christbel and Judd married five years before to save their ranch, which they had joint ownership. Crissy only being sixteen at the time knew that their marriage would come to an end on her twenty first birthday.It was the classic Palmer book of the virgin who fell in love with a man fourteen years older that didn't want to be tied down because of events that happened in his past. I read it in four hours, skimming some parts. If you like a really easy read that won't cause you to think, this is it for you. If you like more emotion and not a lot of running around, this isn't the book for you."
2,When will it end,"Lawless was a big nothing in the end. This is the second Diana Palmer book that I have read. The other one, entitled ""Before Sunrise,"" followed such a similar pattern. Great beginning, with interesting premise.Then the story goes off on tangents--who really cares about the murders and robbery--not really necessary for the romance plot to work.In this book the ""on again off again"" between Judd and Crissy dragged forever. I was bored with it. The plot and writing style was very ""bad movie of the week"" for me."
1,Not worth the money!,I was very disappointed in this product. It's a piece of foam rubber on a flimsy plastic handle. The handle bends before you can put any pressure on the sponge. The sponge head comes off of the handle very easily. I threw the handle away and I am using the sponge in the kitchen.
5,You don't have to be Irish to like this one,"This CD is for anyone who likes good music, and appreciates good composing and arranging. I'm amazed, inspired, and instantly transported to Ireland when I listen to Riverdance. I'd recommend it to everyone I know, but I believe they already own it anyway!"
3,good value,how exciting to view this on a good t.v. it is even better than being there at the Broadway show.
2,Scroll wheel issue,"Like other reviewers, I have a problem with the scroll wheel. In my case, it wobbles back & forth a bit, enough to make the page jump sometimes, or if I'm middle clicking, or scrolling to the top of a page. This one was packaged with the keyboard I wanted, but I'll either have to go back to my wired mouse or buy a better one. I'd hate to have to find the box to take everything back to Staples, and Microshift wants $35 dollars just to look at an email about it! I wonder if Logitech's mouse will work with the same receiver. Probably not. Oy!"
1,"worked for a few hours, mine was defective","I bought this mouse and shipping was very quick. I plugged it in and it worked perfectly, didn't have to install anything. I used it for a good 4-5 hrs and the next day (computer being on the whole time) it stopped working all together. System restores, device drivers, dell tech support... 3 hrs and nothing helped.Mine was defective and I'm going to be returning this back to amazon and going to try a logitech."
1,Piece of crap!!!!!!!!!,"This mouse is terrible,I own this mouse and i use it and im gonna go to get a new mouse because honestly its terrible,1. The scroll wheel has ALOT of side to side play2. No possible way to turn of the mouse except by taking out the battery3. It isn't a precise laser mouse at allU have made me sad Microsoft ;(NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,It works but..,"This product does work at calming down my cats when they are in stressful situations, car rides, thunderstorms etc. However I can't get them to take the stuff without having to administer it like a medication. I've mixed it with water, milk and wet cat food and it seems they can either smell it or taste it and want nothing to do with it."
2,The sweet taste of biting into tea leaves. Yum!,This product is a little on the pricey side and my breath didn't feel fresh at all after popping one of these in my mouth (Which they claim is a natural breath mint).The only satisfactory part of this package is the pear flavor. It doesn't taste as bad as the other two.
3,Rank 1 falls down a bit.,"Rank1 take the great track "" many miles, too soon"". and give it some bad vocals. with some so-so remixs. The vocals just kill this track. make it almost a joke. same they did wiht airwave. Try to forgot them and it becomes a good track"
3,Mingus for Mingus Fans,"Priestley does a good job at giving us an overview of Mingus the musician, that is, who he played with, where he played and when. However, like Beneath the Underdog, the book concentrates too much on the personal and not enough on the music. I was looking for a more critical review of Mingus's compositions and his role as one of the most influential and under appreciated musician of our time, but it seems that Mingus's persona will always overshadow his contributions. On a good note, Priestley's discography is extremely thorough which has made it a constant reference in my house. Finally, the writing is a bit dry which may make it a tough read for the casual jazz fan."
2,Hip To Be Cool,"In slightly under 230 pages, author Brian Priestley attempts to cover the life of Charles Mingus in a biography, discography and musicography. Without the proper focus, the book fails on all counts.I blame the publisher for a work that attempts to deliver so much, but does not have the number of words to make it work. I also strongly feel the editor failed miserably for not making critical calls as the book began to take shape.The major point of interest is a listing of major recordings that Mingus accomplished in his vast career. But when the highlight is a part of the appendix, it speaks loudly about the text!Mingus: A Critical Biography is hardly a definitive work on the oftentimes controversial life of the musical genius. I cannot even recommend it as a primer since those looking for an in-depth exploration on any of the three categories mentioned above will be sorely disappointed."
5,CUTE SCRAPBOOK,"I GOT THIS AS A SHOWER GIFT AND LOVE IT. I ENJOY SCRAPBOOKING MY FAVORITE MEMORIES OF MY SON. YOU CAN BUY THE EXPANDABLE WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF PAGES IN THE SCRAPBOOK AND ADD PAGES TO THE BOOK. Go to Hobby Lobby to buy the pages to add to your scrapbook and unscrew then take it apart to add your pages. The other people that wrote a review about this scrapbook must have not went to their local Scrapbook Store! MY SON WILL LOVE HIS MEMORIES AND THE ANIMAL ARE SO CUTE. YOU CAN USE IT FOR A BOY OR A GIRL.. THE COLORS ARE BRIGHT AND SWEET... IF YOU LOVE CARTER, THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS SCRAPBOOK, I PROMISE!"
2,Very high level overview,"While I acknowledge that I am writing this review long after the initial release of this book, I expected more from it when I made the purchase.I've just started chapter 4, Programmability Features. The code is out of date and many of the features discussed have been changed in Visual Studio 2005.The book is still useful for a brief introduction of new features. If you want to implement any of the features be sure to get a book that is based on the actual released versions of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005."
2,Not what I expected,"Having absorbed as much Titanic information as possible in all media areas I was disappointed in this video simply because it was not what I expected. The video dealt mainly with the research vessel, its equipment and personnel rather than the Titanic herself.Undersea shots were minimal and left me wanting much more. If you are interested in the technology it takes to capture Titanic's image from the 2 1/2 mile depth where she lays, then this may be a video you'll enjoy."
4,Antiheros turn each other into genuine heros,"Just when I think I've read it all when it comes to romances set in 19th century England, out comes a new story which opens with the heroine mugging a young nobleman. We are then introduced to a drunk who has awful taste in women. Wow-- this certainly isn't traditional! My curiosity is always aroused when an author introduces characters who start out as unlikeable. Both the hero and heroine have troubled pasts and make bad decisions in order to cope with it. They're both so witty and charming that I wound up cheering for them. The dialogue is fast, smart, and absorbing. It was a pleasure watching them play off each other as they faced the skeletons in their closets."
4,Nice watch at a nice price.,I bought this watch for my daughter-in-law and she loved it. She liked the style of the bracelet too. I thought the hands were a little too small but she didn't think so. Good product at a great price.
3,too small,"This product is a great idea, it keeps my son very warm and cozy in this cold winter weather, HOWEVER at 13 months he hardly fits in it. I am hoping we'll be able to use it at least until the end of this winter, but absolutely can't imagine using it next winter when he'll only be 2 years old (and supposedly you should be able to use for kids up to 3 years old)."
5,fits great for my 3 year old!,Interesting to read comments about frustrated parents who's children don't fit in the big bundle me. My 3 year old is average for his weight and height and fits perfectly inside the big bundle me. He was comfortable and it kept him very warm. I wonder if they received the wrong size because my son fits inside great. I love this product and would recommend it to all moms who want to make their lives easier and hassle free!
4,Nice and warm... but,"It is a nice product and definitely keeps my baby warm with the colder months coming up. I can also tell that he will be able to use it will he is much older. However, I am currently using it on my City Mini Baby Jogger. I have found that after installing Bundle Me, I am not able to recline the seat. I need to leave it upright as the rubber strap that holds Bundle me to the stroller would not allow it to extend. also, with this installed, trying to get out the strap that folds the stroller into half is a little more cumbersome. Not absolutely perfect, but still defintely useful and more convenient than using a blanket to him him warm ."
1,"No Content, All Fluff","I was extremely disappointed with this book. The content of this books consists entirely of video game screen shots taken from PC based emulators and small snippets of information taken from other, better books. There are no notable insights in this book, and the writing is weak and uninspired. There are many notable exceptions in the content of this book, including one of many collectors favorite games, Atari Quantum.The book holds up fairly well (relatively) on the raster games, but on the true XY games, the emulator screen shots do no justice to the beauty of the real thing. Do not excpect any history lessons on arcade games in general either, there are other, better books for that.If you want to learn a little about the games you play on your emulator, this may be the book for you, but if you are looking for info on the history of video arcade games, you will not find it here."
4,A good visual history,"This book is an excellent visual history of arcade gaming. In certain cases I wish the author had dedicated more than one page to each game. However, the back-story Van Burnham provides on notable projects provides enough interest to make browsing and reading the various sections of the book fun. Looking at the screen shots, old advertisements, and arcade photos made me feel nostalgic for the 'good old days' of arcade gaming.I was somewhat disappointed by the physical materials that went into this book. The hard cover and binding seemed very flimsy and weak leading me to believe that it may not stand up to the test of time. However, the contents of the book still make it a worthy purchase for any gaming or digital art fan."
5,Wow! Wonderful!,"What a great book, and having lived in Dupont Circle several years ago, the images painted of Georgetown, DC, Booeymonger's, etc brought back vivid and accurate images. I'll bet I can even guess the name of the restaurant from which Pavel brought curry, rice and daal to Faith's home! Enjoyed every page immensely!"
5,great keepsake,I love this product! I have used it with both my boys. It is easy to use and looks precious when completed.
2,claire of the moon,"I was a bit disappointed in the book. I didn't see the movie and I'm glad I didn't, if it was anything like the book, I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Kinda sappy."
3,A change for ISIS,"Being a many-year fan of ISIS, I was skeptical from the beginning about this CD coming out since the band started talking about how they were going to be playing shows with Tool. As expected, many people who were only recently introduced to ISIS saw this CD only as a comparison to Tool's music. This CD is pretty good, but not great for ISIS potential. Hearing tribal style drums on nearly every song gets repetitive, especially after hearing the unique and talented drumming from previous albums like Oceanic and SGNL 5. I have no problem at all with the vocals. Aaron has an strong clean voice.Overall, I'd say this is a good CD to add to your ISIS album collection, but it is no where near my favorite. ISIS has moved towards a different side of their own music in the Absence of Truth, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just a lot more mellow than their earlier music. Good album, but not great."
5,"Grimlock, Slag, Sludge, Snarl, and Swoop are heroes","The dinobots (mentioned above) are the strongest of the autobots and with their creation, they now have a fighting chance against the decepticons."
2,Good reference book for advanced subjects,"I used this book as a text for a Heterojunction device class.Although , the book does contain a great deal of useful information , most of it is in the form of statements and data from research publicaions - devoid of any explanation.Also, we found many serious errors in the text.Wouldnt recommend as in introductory text to HBTs"
1,Wonder if it's really a twirler?,Each licorice is very thin and hard to open. I wonder if it is really a Twizzzler or some kind of knock-off.
4,Excellent introduction to the geology of SE Utah,This book is definately worth the money. I bought it while at Arches N.P. because I was amazed by the rock formations of the area. It was so varying that I wanted to learn more. This book definately helped me to understand in laymans terms. This book is definately for the novice. It will make you want to study the subject even more.
5,Looking For A Superman Costume? This Is The One For You!,"Initially I thought the price of this costume was a little steep, although I have received it and then worn it last Halloween I changed my mind. The quality of the material of the costume is not great, but again it's supposed to be pretty thin because what makes this costume fun to look at and wear are the tights. What makes this costume really stand out is the vibrant colors. The red is really red, and the blue is truly blue. None of the colors of this costume look washed out at all, unlike other Superman costume that I have seen that are cheaper in price. People also liked the fact that it came with a cape and that overall it really portrayed the Superman look. The muscle section of the costume can get hot to wear for extended times since it is made of rubber, but its only one day a year so its totally worth it."
2,You people are retarded...,"Do people understand that a beanie is a skull cap? it's not supposed to be a winter hat. For my sake, this was too BIG actually..."
4,Great phone (but the Vonage rebates are a scam).,"This is a really great phone. The range is good and the sound quality is excellent. We also really like the Vonage system, which has worked exceptionally well for us. It works GREAT with broadband, and doesn't slow down even if you're downloading a lot of files, or playing online games.My only gripe is with the Vonage rebates, which are terrible. Put simply, Vonage doesn't pay. Once they've got you signed up what are you going to do? It's too little money to switch, and so you won't... but you'll be out $50 or $100. So buyer beware, I suppose. On the vonage forums one poll indicated that 70%+ hadn't received rebates... so be careful here.In spite of the rebate ripoff, I do love the product. So I guess that says something!"
2,Not worth buying,"This game guide has very little about the University expanision Pack itself. The book has nearly 500 pages and only abut 150 or so dedicated to the expansion pack. The rest is merely The Sims 2 strategy guide. When I first saw this in the store, I thought that it would be a mixture of both the original strategy guide and also with lots of HELPFUL information about the University expansion pack. I couldn't have been more wrong. While most of the information provided about the Sims 2 game itself from the original strategy guide is very helpful, the minimal info provided about the expansion pack is nearly as helpful. Many a times, it was very rare that I'd find the answer to a question I had about something in the expansion pack inside this strategy guide and I'd end up going online to find the answer. It's not worth the money."
5,Perfect,"These lasted me quite awhile and were great to use.The lids or 'caps' were fitted down nicely and didn't come off unlike the current one I have now. I almost wish I bought the same brand again because these worked pretty well.The air from the cans had an odd smell but it wasn't like the air from my current can which almost has a slight odd chemical smell. Not that anyone but me is going to be blasting themselves with the canned air... But you never know.This product lasted awhile, not just because I had two cans but one can would last quite awhile before it ran out of air or didn't have enough oomph to work well.Over all these worked well and lasted quite awhile with the use I put them through. I would definitely recommend this product to someone else."
3,Very nice quality but seems very fragile,"Probably predictable from the price but this necklace is made of very, very thin gold and I'm worried will break without much pulling. Otherwise, it's beautiful."
3,Good for music trivia tid-bits,"This book is loaded full of factoids about various music stars from when the Billboard Hot 100 chart began in the mid-1950's to 1995. The factoids may be interesting, but this book also provides a ranking of hit songs by year, artist, label, etc. I think many people would find the ranking algorithm disputable, and thus, the order of the song rankings disputable as well. It's still good for flipping through and finding random interesting facts about an artist, a year, a label, etc."
2,the cable worked one time,The cable worked one time then could not be recognized by my computer at all. Amazon was great and sent me another one and covered the shipping both ways. I have not had a chance to use the new replacement yet.
4,Woodie Has Skills,"This Album Is Good. some songs aren't the greatest, but there are many tight songs like number one ""N the bay"" and number five, which is straight sick, ""talez of a killa"" I think this album is good, worth buying. if you like YOC influenced, his first album, and either Northern Exposure album produced by woodie, you will like this cd."
1,garbage,THIS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT GARBAGE IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE HALF A STAR. WOODIE DOESN'T DESERVE TO TOUCH A MICROPHONE. THE BEATS ARE HELLA BUNK AND HIS FLOWS ARE HELLA BUNK
1,woodies fake,This is going out to brian Lynch. Woodie sucks. U can't even compare eminem to woodie.Woodie is faker his own homboys knock him out. When the hell has woodie made a 10 million dollars or even a single mill. Out of all the northern rappers Mr kee Is the realist from northern cali. And woodie is not one of the greats rappers from the bay u said he was up their with andre nickatina hell no. He isn't good enough to compare them two in a same sentence.
5,Unusually practical advice.,"I used to keep an overseas bank account but I learned it is far more private to keep one's cash INSIDE the U.S. Also, the idea that my name should never be connected with where I live, not on one single document, was an eye-opener. At first it seemed impossible but the author shows simple ways to follow this advice on everything from bank accounts and credit cards to drivers' licenses and income tax returns. I have thirty-two books on privacy and asset protection but Luna's book has more practical information that all the others put together. He deals in facts not theory. My only complaint is that the book could have been longer. I would have liked to read more anecdotes about the author's various clients and how they solved their problems."
1,Huge Disappointment,"None of the bearings are the right size. All the rabbets are are 1/16 to 3/32 off from what they should be. Some are deeper, some are shallower. Not even the flush bearing is right. I have several other Freud bits that I am very happy with, but this set is a waste of money."
1,Waste of time and money,Wow. I grew up with my dad's and granddad's machetes and this one is a joke.It was so dull I have no idea why it came in a box. I tried for hours to sharpen this one and it was pointless.I was unable to cut through simple vines and undergrowth in my backyard.Do NOT buy this product.
3,"A big technique, but Watts is a low-key Liszt interpreter","Mr Wilkinson has gotten his wrist slapped for writing such a blunt review, but even for a listener who is sympathetic to Andre Watts, still the most famous Afro-American classical pianist in the world after forty years, it's discouraging that his impressive technique didn't lead to musical growth. Many of his best recordings date from the beginning of his career. This flashy Liszt recital includes all the notes, but as Wilkinson says, it's all a bit muddled and aimless musically.He's also right to point out that Watts displays none of the flashing brilliance and fire of a Volodos or Kissin, and La Campanella is indeed tinkly in his hands. The great B minor Sonata is given a flabby run-through, as is everything else here. I am giving three stars in sympathy with Watts' intentions, too guilty to award what he really deserves."
3,Something for the FAN,These little adventures are alot a fun if you are an absolute fan of the Xena series. You can make the charaters do other things that does not follow the story line exactly. Or you can follow the story line. Death in Chains I was able to have Gabrielle kiss the guy many timies and the sound effect was just hilarious to me.It can get a little boring after awhile but just wait six or eight months and play it again. Invite some friends to check it out. I had fun with it.
4,useful product,I bought this strap after having hip replacement surgery and it was very helpful. It would be nice if instructions were included because I initially didn't have the wire threaded down to make it as effective of a tool.
4,"Good for SQL, excellent reference","This book, with no doubt, is easy to understand. It provides extensive coverage of the query language with excellent examples.If you're a newbie to the SQL subject - this is book is a good choice to start with because it will guide you through the fundamentals of SQL. BUT!!!! If you need to design a database schema you will probably want to consult a different book (that place major emphasis on database modeling and normalization - those topics are not covered extensively)Simple, practical and to the point. 4 Starts!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I started composting this year and have been searching for several months for a bag that is compostable but sturdy at the same time. This bag is definitely NOT what I have been looking for. This bag begins to break down in the trash can as soon as it gets any moisture on it. I was using it for all my food waste, and since most food is at least somewhat moist, it would get wet as soon as I put any kind of food in it and the trash can would get dirty and gross. I only used three of the bags before I got sick of cleaning out my trash can every time I changed the bag. It completely defeats the purpose of a trash liner if you have to clean yucky stuff out of your trash can between bag changes. This purchase was a complete waste of money."
1,"Too thin, too short, too bad.","I bought a couple of boxes of these at the local grocery store and figured I would give them a try. Bad decision.They look nice (not sure why that matters in a garbage bag), and the idea behind them is sound, but the functionality is terrible. They're FAR too thin, they rip through almost immediately, and they aren't even tall enough for a standard 13 gallon kitchen can. They're fairly expensive as well, so after the first 3 bags ripped and I ended up throwing the remaining 21 of them away, I'm extremely disappointed in them. BioBag has a long way to go before their product is ready for prime-time."
2,"Good idea, but clammy !","I try to do my best with sustainable products and recycling, so bought these bags. I love the idea of them, but after just a few days the garbage stinks, the bag turns wet and clammy and they are extremely thin and have ripped from just tossing a stalk of broccoli in the bag. Sometimes I actually double bag these in my garbage can so they don't tear, but they're already pretty expensive so I'm basically paying twice as much. Not sure if I'm going to continue with these bags - wish there was another biodegradable alternative...."
1,Handle-less in 6 minutes flat!,"I had a Jolly Ball previously but was lost to a flood. My dog enjoyed it so much that I ordered another. Apparently my first purchase was the ""horse"" version because this 6"" Tug and Toss was out of box and into trash within 16 minutes. My Golden Doodle chomped on the handle until it was in pieces.A bit pricey for a canine hors d'oeurve."
2,Pommie,So disappointed in this product. Looked like the dogs were in heaven until the handle was completely chewed off in about 4 minutes. After that they did not bother with it any more. My dogs are really tough on their toys and I am constantly looking for toys that last and keep their interest.
1,Mean-spirited fluff,"This book claims to be about the decline of the aristocracy, but is really a mean-spirited look at the misfortunes of several aristocratic dynasties and persons. The author gleefully rips apart Winston Churchill, Lord Curzon, Vita Sackville-West and others, while adding no new insight into their characters. Lord Curzon was obsessed with ceremony? Now there's a startling relevation.There is very little substance to this book and no conclusions are reached, or even suggested."
4,Good read for a psychologist,I am not a psychologist but very interested in how us humans think. This book seemed more like a guide for people in this field. I only recommend it for people in this field.
4,A pleasant if somewhat biased view of Defense Contractors,Augustine comes across as the type of person you would love to have as a dinner companion. He has wonderful stories and a very rich life experience to draw upon. The book is an easy ready and most people will get something from it. I was left wanting more depth in the deatils of the merger initiations. I also have enough experience with Lockheed Martin to know that Augustine views his company the same way that every parent believes their child is the star of their Little League team.
4,Awesome!,"Excelent, helped me a lot writing a really good business plan. Clarified doubts and opened my eyes avoiding anxiety and excessive protection over my ideas."
5,A hikers dream,"This is the only travel book going with me when I go to the big island. The details in the book are great, and I look forward to seeing how accurate the directions are. If you want to get off the beaten track, this is the book for you."
2,NOT THE SAME CLIPS,"The brake pad fits ok, but the clips are smaller!! I had to leave the old clips instead!!. very disappointed."
1,Incomplete,"This book contains errors. Namely Psalm 151 is part of the original Greek Septuagint, but not to be found in this edition. I'm starting to see now how authors may be ""misrepresenting"" information for their own adjenda's."
4,The real deal,"I originally got this volume as a way to practice my Greek a little bit more. What I found, obviously, was that LXX Greek is very different than GNT Greek. But the other find that I came to was that it was a marvelous translation of the Greek text. I was interested in just how much the Greek LXX different from the Hebrew scriptures. I like the volume a lot for it's translation and for the original text which parallels the English. I use it frequently in a library with the GNT and the Hebrew Scriptures as a handy 3 volume set for desk reference. I would say that you have to be a fairly serious scholar to warrant something like this but if you are then it is well worth the money and looks to be made to last. Definitely a must have for pastors and theologians!"
4,Keepin' It Real!,"Alfonzo Blackwell's keepin' it real with his new album release""Reflections"". He sizzles with ""Funky Shuffle"", ""All Blues"" and ""Take You Out"". He also gives his listeners the music formaking love with ""Joy"", ""Somewhere Someday"" and ""Precious Love"". This is a must have CD!"
5,"Yes, another 5-star review","Actually, the verdict is fairly unanimous on this product, according to the other reviews.... I ordered a reel (after returning a cheaply made Ames reel) and am very pleased with the unit. No issues at all - except it is substantial and takes up some room, so make sure you measure first.This is the last hose reel you'll ever buy. Well made, well engineered, easy to install. Great!!!"
5,"Its about time, I should have purchased this a long, long time ago.",I was fed up with purchasing multiple hose reels that would crack or break. I finally spent a little extra and purchased the Rapid Reel. I couldn't be happier with my purchase it allows a lot of reeling with little effort compared to the plastic reels. It reels smooth and is built to last. I use a 150 foot very heavy duty car wash hose (detail bay) and it reels with no problems. Expert approved!
4,What happens when it freezes?,I like my rapid reel but that could be because the old plastic one was less fun than thorn in your toe. This seems well built. The instructions contain errors that make assembly more difficult than is necessary.we will see what happens when it freezes. Too bad it couldn't have been made to be removed from wall for winter drainage and storage. Update: It has been though a few freeze thaw cycles without a problem.
5,"Sturdy, rugged, and smooth","I own multiple Rapid Reel products and they all share common features.1. Very sturdy2. Able to handle harsh environments (did I mention that it is sturdy).3. Made in the USA and you can call them directly if you have an issue.4. Zero leaks.5. Smooth functioning and easy to use.Cons:Although I had no problems assembling the unit, I had to take time to stare at the instructions. I took about an hour to collect the required tools, assemble the unit, have the wife hold the unit against the wall so I could mark drill holes (after using a stud finder to verify that I was drilling into the wall studs), and then attach the unit to the wall.Other Thoughts:Based on the products that I own from Rapid Reel, I am very impressed."
4,Overall great but . . .,"We ordered 2 of these after reading the reviews and trashing many plastic reels that just haven't survived the weather. The product was easy to assemble and seems quite sturdy to last a long time. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars was due to the installation bolts that were included to mount it on brick walls. If there are air gaps in the walls like our house has, the bolts push back into the wall leaving little or no bolt exposed to attach the reel to. We were finally able to make it work, but it was a frustrating process. Now that they are installed, we love them!"
5,Well engineered product,"This is a great product, not like the typical flimsy hose reel you find at the store. I've bought both styles of their hose reels and have been very happy with them."
3,The book is in Metric and uses British Codes!,"Post-tensioned concrete floor design is not taught in my graduate school. I bought the book because I have a project that I may need to design a post-tensioned floor system. The book measurements are mosly in metric units and the authors mostly referred to BT Codes NOT ACI. Though well written, I found it not very practical to my application.Joseph, Los Angeles"
5,Inspiring,"I read often and found this book to be one of the best on the topic of intuition. If you want to read about intuition or miracles and magical happenings, this is the book for you. I recommend it!!!"
1,What Happened??,"I have read several of Dunning's book and loved them but this one;it starts out fine but switches back and forth until it,s hard tofollow but the ending is unbelievable..unbelievable because I amstill not sure what happened with some important things such aswho was the killer of a leading character and a particular brutalkilling for that matter. Maybe I,m missing something but I,m leftwondering who ""done it"". I know the answer to one murder but notthe other. Very, very disappointing."
3,Series is weakening,"I loved the earlier books, mostly because of the arcane, fascinating detail of the book trade. This one had very little of that type of information, and a lot about horseracing - which I also find interesting, but just didn't think the 2 ever really meshed. I felt like that author had the racing experience in his past, and just wanted to use it. Also, he spent a lot of time making an interesting character out of Junior, who then disappearred from the book. And who was minding the store while he and Erin were gone all this time? One very funny line, when he is concussed and thinks Stephen King wrote The Red Badge of Courage! Hope the next one in the series gets back to the book stuff, but am not sure - the book ends with him wanting to be a cop again."
2,Does this irritate anyone else?,"I ran onto it in the first chapter: it occurs four or five times. Maybe it doesn't bother anyone else: it's just a grammatical absurdity. Why does he use a colon (:) when a semi-colon(;) is what's called for? I've never run into this before. Does he not know, or does he not care? I had to decide if I wanted to read the other 35 chapters, enduring this, or dump it. I did read them all, and it is a pretty good story: but why does he do this to us grammaticians?"
3,Isn't the ending weird?,"This book is ok, but just barely ok. No, It's not as good as the other ones. But...doesn't anyone else think the ending is very strange? Why is he doing a favor for the murderer? The guy murdered two people and tried to murder Janeway twice. And Janeway is doing him a favor? Isn't the guy going to the electric chair? The conversation with the guy on the previous pages is also weird. Janeway, have you forgotten about the burning car? I suppose an explanation is that he knows that the guy is completely crazy, and he wants the final confession, which he gets, but this is not made clear. And the final words -- the beginning of an exciting new...for.... The perfect gift for.... (I don't want to give away too much). Exciting new beginning? Perfect gift? This is a double murderer who tried to burn Janeway alive (or dead). I don't get it...."
2,A disappointing addition to the series,"I loved the four previous ""Bookman"" books and was eagerly anticipating this latest novel. I was seriously disappointed and could barely get through the first chapter- it was excrutiating to make myself plod through to the end. I had been excited about the premise- a dead woman who collected rare children's books- but other than Janeway occassionally exclaiming- ""Wow, this version of such and such children's book in really rare and in great condition,"" I did not feel like Dunning included much on the rare book angle. I don't think that these are particularly great mysteries as a whole, but I love reading about and learning about various aspects of the rare book world and that is why I like(d) the Bookman books.Anyway, give it a shot if you are already a fan, just to stay current with what is going on in the series, but if you rae new, start with the first, ""Booked to Die."""
3,Impossible twist,"In this novel we learn about the world behind horse racing as well as the normal book industry information. The author knows what he is talking about and does a good job of describing both worlds.However, the final twist in the plot really turned me off! Mystery novels with a twist are great, but the twist in the plot has to be at least somewhat believable - in this case it is not.If you are into the Bookman series, then you have to read this to stay up with the overall Janeway story line, but other than that, save your money."
3,Not His Best,"I have enjoyed all of the Janeway novels a great deal. However, this was a bit disappointing. Told me more about horse racing than I wanted to know and told me less about book collecting than I wanted and that I have become used to in the Bookman series. And I feel that Dunning committed what was once considered a ""sin"" in the mystery writing genre in that we were never really introduced to the character that did the dirty deed until very late in the novel...three fourths of the way through or even later. The reader had very little reason to include this suspect on the suspect list. I found it to be a deux ex machina production. I will however, purchase the next Bookman novel....should there happen to be one."
4,Excellent book for introducing a new NCO to how the USMC operates. But I have two minor problems...,"...shouldn't there be an updated version of this book. Especially with all that has changed with the Marine Corps over the past 13 years since it was first published. There also needs to be a reference appendix detailing a specific manual, publication or MCO involved with a particular subject in this book. Other than that, this is an excellent book for a Marine looking to earn a rank higher than LCpl."
2,This book is outdated,"The 5th edition of the NCO handbook is really outdated. I would not recommend that any of my NCOs buy it. It will only confuse them. I have been a Marine for over 23 years and never in my career has it been appropriate to call a 1stSgt ""Top"". I also own editions 3 and 4 and very little has changed in the editions. The Corps has changed but these books haven't."
5,nice pads,"Had to guess on size to order, other than s-m-l-xl (not indicated in advertisement), and we got lucky. The size Medium was perfect for my son who is 70 pounds, he can continue to grow with these pads. The pads were labeled for weight ranges 70-105. Would be great to have this information prior to placing the order. They were delivered on time, with great packaging. Nice set of pads, but the company probably could sell more if they indicated the weight/height in sizes"
1,Much better books out there,"I read the reviews and bought the book. This is one book that I would not have bought if I had been in a hands-on bookstore. The writing is pedestrian and story is an old one.I would highly recommend Mieville's The City and The City. The writing is good and story really amazing.I would also highly recommend anything by John Crowley and, of course, Philip K. Dick."
1,interesting,I can't say this CD really appealed to me. It's not my cup of tea. There was only a couple of tracks i was interested in which was the reworking with Melissa Etheridge. Mainly i lost this CD from a library so had to replace it. I would say save your money.
1,Do not buy these for a Mercedes.,"Like the other rater, this did not come with 8 fuses. Only 2 white, 1 red and 1 blue. I had to buy two of these and they worked for a while. However, older Mercedes Benz's have copper fuse box connectors. These aluminum fused corrode since they are a different metal. The solution is to use fuses that are made of copper/brass alloy that will not corrode nearly as fast. These are not worth it at all. I would probably be better off wrapping a chewing gum wrapper around the old fuse as a temporary fix over using these. Save your money and get the better fuses."
2,WTF????,"I had heard various leaks from this album over the years and I must say this hybrid album as it is being called is a nice way of saying WTF is this?!? Tip should not be singing, he makes T-Pain sound like Luther Vandross. This album is trash, the only reason I didnt give it 0 stars was because I usually dig everything that Tip puts out but this album is a travesty.........."
4,Ford History,"""The Ford Century"" is an exceptional insight into the history of the American automobile industry. The pictures and artwork are excellent. The narative is easy to read and sufficiently detailed to tell even the most avid care freak most eveything he/whe might want to know about how the Ford Motor Company got the place it holds in the industrial and cultural history of the USA. It's the perfect companian book to ""Ford at Fifty"", which to the best of my knowledge had only limited availability when it was published over fifty years ago by Simon & Shuster as the chronicle of Ford's first fifty years. Highly recommended."
5,"So Far, So Good",The directions are easy to follow. The seedlings are growing well. My next step will be thinning out and transplanting -- the hard part for me. Great kit for a beginner. I put all the seeds in the basket -- that's why I will need to transplant some seedlings shortly. I would recommend spacing the seeds and not planting all the seeds in the basket.
5,They are coming BACK to MEMPHIS!!!!!!,"The return of Saliva is going to be at Newby's on Highland on September 16th, 2000!!!! About time you guys. We will definitely be there."
5,GROOVY,"My boyfriend Brad gave me an experience of a lifetime! He brought me to a Saliva concert in Memphis. I had been listening to the cd of his for a while..and I loved it. My favorite song is of course Groovy---I kept yelling out for them to play it, but they never did! However, they played some new songs of theirs and I can't wait till that hits the stores. Good luck to them...they are an excellent band that consist of good, down to the earth guys."
4,Not quit as good as Survival of the Sickest or Back Into Your System,"This CD wasn't bad, although it dissapointed me a little because it wasn't quit on par with Back Into Your System and Survival Of The Sickest (both of which I'd give 5 stars). I would heavily reccommend the two afore mentioned Saliva CDs and say that this one was alright. Most bands get better with age; this CD was better than their self titled album."
4,Cold Burn,A COLD RED SUNRISE is an interesting read in that it shines some light on the former Soviet Union and it's policing methods. It also shows some Russian police officers doing a dangerous job in a society that seldom appreciates their efforts not to mention usually at the whim of politicos that hold the power...hmm? Guess they're not all that much different that we are and could describe the working life of police officers anywhere.A good story.
2,"""Natural"" is deceptive!","This is NOT peanuts-only peanut butter, as the name implies. It has added palm oil and sugar, which are exactly the kinds of ingredients I wish to avoid. The web page lists the ingredients if you scroll down, but I leaped to my conclusion that it was ""natural"" peanut butter when I read the product name."
5,Great Series,We love this series!! Its just a very good TV series. I think they are kinda expensive on dvd but well worth the purchase if you like the show
3,The Vampire Diaries,"If this is something you're interested in, than it's probably a good buy. I thought the show was just okay, but I bought the other seasons, therefore, I needed to get this one."
1,doesnt work on tablet,"There seems to be a problem with the streaming on an android tablet, so seeing as I can't watch it, I give it one star."
4,Love TVD But ....,I am obsessed with the Vampire Diaries and Damon. Have seasons 1 and 2. Just got season 3. BUT...disk two freezes and skips. Luckily I had seen those episodes so I just waited it out till it spun to a part where it wanted to work. Starting disk 3 tonight. Hopefully the rest will work properly. Can't wait till Oct 11 for Season 4.
5,I love it,I love this product so much that I can not wait to watch on a day when iam not working and there is nothing to watch on tv
5,love vampire diares,This was a great episode. Definitely worth paying for this episode and getting caught up (since I didn't get into this silly series until late) with the current episodes. Not interested in using those illegitimate websites online... they will give you viruses!
5,Awesome!,"Love love love this show, the DVDs came and it was just what I wanted, the DVDs were not scratched and it was in perfect condition."
5,OH MY DAMON!!!,"I recently just got hooked on the vampire diaries and I love it!! I watched the whole season 3 in one day! Everything about the three [Stefan,Elena, & Damon] makes my heart melt! I def. recommend watching this whole series!!!!"
5,"Helen's Vampire Diaries, Season 3 Review",This is an incredible series. I've become completely sucked in and obsessed. Highly recommended. Very addictive. Always leaves you dying for more.
5,The Best Vampires in Town,"If you watch ""The Vampire Diaries"" on TV, I don't have to tell you how great this video series is. Owning the episodes for re-watching is a real treat. While some say the writing faltered a bit in the middle of the season (there are still three more new episodes to come as of this writing), taken as a whole the series is thrilling. TVD fits between ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood"". To me, ""Twilight"" is bloodless (pardon the pun!) and True Blood is good but R rated. If you haven't seen TVD, buy the third season, but buy seasons 1 and 2 also so you can catch up. You will be so caught up in the absorbing story lines, the wonderful characters, the danger, the sexiness (but no complete nudity or graphic sex for those of you who need to know that), and the beautiful people who are also good actors, that you will be hooked!"
5,Vampire Diaries Season 3,This was an excellent buy if you are into the show. Came in a nice compact case. Cannnot wait for the next season.
5,This was a gift,She loves it. Came quickly and safely packaged. I don't know what else to say but apparently I am supposed to say more.
5,Good 11i Manufacturing and Supply Chain book,I was looking for a book like this since Oracle 11i Release. This is a very good book for the new and experienced Manufacturing and Supply Chain Professional.This book touches almost every part of the subject/module in Mfg. and it can be used as a Handbook too. This book is very knowledgeable and resourceful.I have recommended this book to many of my friends. Even my friends also feel that it is very useful book.What I liked most about this book is its organization and going detail about the important areas with examples and screen shots.Another good thing about this book is that it is both functional and technical. This book tells us about the important oracle tables and logical diagrams. It is very difficult to find a book like this one in the market. Good job!.
2,"Re-hash of old material, mostly.","Kenny Rankin has a beautiful vocal instrument, butthis is just another re-tread of old material, to nodiscernible advantage. He has real trouble playing ""Blackbird"",seeming lost, but still sings it with characteristic charm.His pitch isn't exactly rock solid, and it's hard to tellwhy that is. We look forward to a truly new recordingfrom him!"
5,Just what I was looking for,"I was taking a chance ordering a baby book sight unseen, as I am pretty particular. We are expecting our 3rd child. I have seen bookoos of baby books, and nothing seemed quite right. I am sooooo glad I found this one! The classic illustations are beautiful. The ""fill in the blank"" format is perfect. I don't like ""journal-type"" baby books, because having 2 children already, I don't have the time to write a novel. This baby book was well thought out & gosh...you cannot beat the price! The outside cover is soft & puffy...too cute!"
4,Hilarious!. . .,"The only thing that keeps this cd from being a 5 star album is the song Palmdale. Its a song that is too serious for Afroman to do, and it sounds ridiculously out of place on this record. However, Palmdale, and Palmdale alone is the only sorespot in this otherwise brilliant album. The best songs are Because I Got High, She Won't Let Me. . ., and Crazy Rap. Afroman has a style that reminds me alot of Digital Underground, and Marvin Sease, he has a sense of humor about everything, and that is what makes this album great."
2,Give it some credit.........I guess........,"Honestly....I will give this album some credit because of one thing and one thing only. The video for ""Because I Got High"" has white guys in it. Jay and Silent Bob are in the video. WOW!!!! White guys in a rap video that aren't being put down or made fun of. Instead they smoke a big joint with Afroman. I never thought I would see that. Oh yeah sure you see white women in a rap video but WOW a white guy and he's not being made fun of! Man that took my breathe away.The one song has a nice slow beat but still lakes intelligence and respect for others. Certain songs talk about banging a KKK members daughter to ""was-going-to-pay"" child support.Never understood rap and never will....maybe if I was a monkey jumping around like a stoned flea on a hot brick maybe I would understand. As for the album itself....pass on it, nothing much to listen to but yet again if you like rap go for it.Afroman ~ 1 star out of 10 stars"
2,Nice idea but poorly executed,"As others have mentioned the plastic sticks will be bent all to hell after normal usage, and even if you try to carefully insert the knives (steak knives stored upside down seem to work better) it still happens. I've resorted to plucking and snipping large pockets of the bent needles to that larger knives can fit in.They really should have rounded the tips of all the plastic needles as the flat ends cause sharp knives to catch them on the way down and cause the bending.I do like the design and look, but in terms of functionality I should have just bought a normal wood block."
3,Disturbing...,I didn't find this book was scary at all. I found it more disturbing than anything else. Makes me wonder how R. Patrick Gates wrote something like this...hopefully not from experience!! I also felt that they were more Nursery Rhymes than Fairy Tales. I kept on finding that I couldn't put the book down though.
1,disappointingly unrealistic,"I've read 8 books by Nancy Kress but after this one I'm not sure I'll read more. This book degrades into military fiction, and leaves out the development of characters so they are nothing but shells. This book is sorely unrealistic leaving the story unbelievable. I can't explain too much without giving away the story, but basically, the Furs who are supposed to be a very intelligent race are not smart enough to use ceramics and know nothing about quarantines. I thought the setup for this series was interesting but I think Kress is concentrating on a prolific career instead of worrying about plausibility. Let's hope the next series is not about war with aliens."
5,Excellent Book!,"This book has some great techniques - the line system is simple, brutal, and effective.It is well written and very easy to understand with decent illustrations.As far as self-defense goes, I think the majority of the information is very applicable, however I would skip the finishing move on most of the techniques (since it involves killing your opponent). My only negative comment would be that it is somewhat lacking in groundfighting information. This is an excellent resource to add to your martial arts library.I highly recommend it!"
1,Don't buy - look for a better book,"I'm an undergraduate student at PSU taking EE350, and most of the students here have found this book to be utterly useless. The examples are poor, the text is pure math... I would like to learn this material, but I'll need to purchase another book to do so."
1,Complete garbage,"The introductions of new concepts are unorganized and seem like an afterthought. Whenever a nuance in a method is mentioned, it is usually tens of pages away from when the topic is first talked about. Most of the problems are extremely more difficult than whatever examples are worked out. Answers aren't even in the back of the book, so you can't check if you've worked them out correctly. Terrible explanations throughout."
2,International Edition,"I bought this textbook as it was required for an American course. It is in a good shape and easy to read. But I bought the international edition (especially for Asia) without knowing it. The American version and international edition are pretty much the same. Everything seems to be the same, except the numeration of the problems. So when getting homework the instructor will give me numbers of the national, American, edition and I need to figure out the international numbers. That is inacceptable but solvable."
1,Coyotes love it,I bought this and an electric call and the coyotes come in and are fixated on this quivering critter and not me and my rifle. I like it.
1,Disappointed,"We were disapointed with our new purchase. We read the directions and put in the batteries as shown. We then pressed the little button and nothing:( We tried several time even touching the wire screen, nothing. We'd like to get our money back."
3,Bug Zapper,"It works. Cheap plastic, but fun zapping those annoying bugs. Buttons on each side make it more child safe, however, there is an extra charge left in the netting even if the buttons are pressed."
1,cheapo,This product was broken when shipped to us - when we received a second one it broke within 3 minutes of first use.
4,Not a Killer,"This product works well, but most of the time it does not kill the fly unless chased down on the floor for further zaps which is why 4 stars."
4,"Effective, needs updated design","I have been using one of these models for over 2 years and it does work very well. It's not for kids, a little flimsy and stings if you touch it.Highs - it definitely kills bugs, especially mosquitoes. Spiders make a popping noise. I think I am still on the original batteries after 2 years. Its safety feature works well - here are two low buttons that both need to be pressed to activate the device.Low - Barely designed. It's a tennis racquet which is isn't always the right shape for killing a bug."
3,Seller Changed Model,The product works but the model was changed without notifying me prior to shipment AND they still use a different photo.
1,If you get lucky!,I purchased this because we have a big fly problem in the summer.Well it works if you get lucky and the wires that run across do not pop out and the flies are big enough. Most times the flies just fly right inbetween the wires. Also I have had instances where you can clearly see the fly was zapped and the fly will fall to the ground only to fly away as soon as it hits the ground. The product was hated by everyone in my family and I am returning it!
3,works but with practice,"this does work---I was cautious when I first bought it and didn't have high expectations. it does not work for small gnats because the holes/grid are too big. hopefully they will make one with a smaller grid design. as for flies, sometimes it takes two or three swats to make sure that the flies fall to the floor. i do wish the power was stronger bc if you hit the fly once and it falls to the ground, moments later you can see the fly buzzing around (on the floor still) so then you have to physically squash the fly! would be nice to only have to swat the fly once! it is kinda fun running around with it though!"
1,bad product,"Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug Zapperabsolutely worthless. Fly lands on it directly and is fine. Real rip-off. Have to actually hit the fly so no better than regular fly swatter, in fact, worse. I am handicapped and didn't want to chase flies. Still have to with regular swatter. Flies laugh at this one."
5,very helpful..........,The family loves to barbeque in the summer. The annoying thing is bugs. We need to always cover the food very well or bugs will get into it. I bought the fly swatters to try to keep the bugs away. We put this near the food and you will hear zapping noise. For some reason the kids get so happy and excited when they hear the zapping noise. I am glad this thing really works. Now I don't have to always stand near the food and make sure it's well covered.
1,very fragile inside .. difficult to put batteries in.,"Buy only if you know how take things apart and put them together again. Comes with no batteries.In order to put 2 AA batteries in, one has to remove 3 screws. Then the whole thing falls apart. It is VERY FRAGILE inside.The batteries have to be put in carefully. The electronics is fully exposed, some very thin wires connect the components.It can generate > 2000 Volts if one accidentally press the 2 ON buttons.. fortunately both buttons have to be pressed.The 2 ""ON"" buttons need to be put back in carefully. The screws have different length, must make sure you put them into the right place.So, if you like to takes things apart and would like to be challenged to put them back together this is the right device for you."
4,Zap Racket smokes em,"I ordered this Zap Racket June 2010 and enjoyed it for a couple of years. In 2012 I noticed the battery life was very low...lost charge after disconnecting quickly. I did two things.1. I wrote to the Zap Racket company not so much complaining but hoping for some technical assistance in reviving. They replied in a hand written personalized email. Bottom line I was very satisfied with a low cost replacement. I still will be apprehensive about having poor battery life in 3 years and want to learn what kind of rechargeable, what is optional charging strategy, but meanwhile I am back in business now, with 2 Zap Rackest (summer in Minnesota = bug time!).2. I ordered one of the competitors, an Alkaline, not rechargeable battery set-up, which could turn out to be good but right off the bat a big 'june bug"" blew in and the new AA powered racket did not seem to touch it. I pulled out my old Zap Racket, which I had left plugged in, and brought him down pronto. I am a Zap man for now."
3,Effective but flawed,"Bug zapper rackets are very effective, but this model has a short life-span (I am on my third one).Problems: 1) on-off switch becomes dislodged, breaks off and fails and/or 2)the wires flex and come out of the rim (easy to replace but annoying).With the approach of the fall ""fly tennis"" season, I hope to find a sturdier model."
1,worked one week,"cheaply made piece of junk. worked one week. now it's over. even while it worked it wasn't good. never killed the fly, just tortured 'em. i don't like flies, but i'd rather kill 'em in one whack. this thing slowly cooked 'em."
1,yuck!,I think this book was a waste of my time and I wouldn'trecommend anyone else to read it. It was a boring story that didn'thave a climax or a point. It was very difficult to pick up any deep meaning in it.
1,This book is about characters who are always drunk.,There is no point to this novel. It was BORING. Don't read it because you'll fall asleep on the first page.
4,Transcendental Meditation,"It was a great moment when the DVD arrived and I got into it as soon as possible. It was sent by the author himself giving all his coordinates with the DVD. It is rare to have a personal relation granted with the purchase but it is well within the spirit of the matter. For all of those who luck information on how the Indian spirituality actually arrived in the west, this is a very important document. I immediately after watching the DVD bought the book ' Science of being and art of living by Maharishi and was taken into the world of TM. I would say that the DVD is almost a collectors item by now."
4,"Very Fine, though Hardly Definitive","I've had the first American edition of this text for not quite half a century, and I can heartily recommend it as a very readable and illuminating summary of the First World War. Perhaps most history books will tend to attract controversy, and any volume about this particular conflict is absolutely bound to. One might quibble with Taylor's perception or emphasis here or there; I suggest you take whatever personal grains of salt you're forced to ingest and enjoy the parts that don't rub you the wrong way. As an introduction to the war, I think it's first-rate, though certainly hardly the last word. And keep in mind that Taylor did a similar job on World War II."
5,sturdy but classy,I have an assortment of various Wusthof knives I've collected over the years and needed a block to put them in. I was thrilled to find the matching storage block. The block is sturdy and elegant looking. It really classes up the set. The bonus scissors are also high quality and easy to disassemble to clean.
1,Subject Line didn't tell me Enough information.,"I was so disappointed when i opened this product. yes, it's beautifully made and for someone with a huge kitchen and many, many knives it would have been perfect.. i'm a novice. NO WHERE on the subject line of this product did it say that it was a '3 piece set'. After i got it - i SAW clearly on the documents that it says that, but i went back and looked at the description on Amazaon and it never said i'd be getting more than the storage block. Plus the block was way too big for me. 17 slots - i thought i was getting seven. THAT was my mistake. I'm looking for a dainty storage block..."
5,Perfect basic block,"Very happy with the block. The price is pretty fantastic for a wood Wusthof block with shears and honing steel included - I was looking for a steel and didn't have shears, so this was perfect. It's sturdy, not too big, looks great. Fits a few of our older knives, and the new Wusthof 8 inch chef's knife and 3 1/2 inch paring knife that I just bought for my husband."
4,Property Rights as an Extension of Liberty,"I think eminent domain is a subject no one really thinks about until it somehow involves us. However, it is an important topic that we should all be paying more attention to. The author makes a clear argument for property rights being an essential part of liberty. He clearly demonstrates our Founding Fathers thought the two were completely interconnected. This book includes many examples of government being on the wrong side of property rights issues and the reason for it being so. I recommend this book to anyone who cares about liberty and values the right to own property without interference from our government."
3,"Remove the words ""Masterful Facilitator"" from a page or two","Good book - I have gained a lot from this book but it is not an easy read. Take that beat-to-death-ugly phrase, ""Masterful Facilitator"", out of a few pages, please. Sounds like we're reading about the ""Terminator"". Good lessons we can all learn concerning change in the workplace - good reality check when dealing with inevitable changes."
5,"Ahn-plugged, Ahn Trio","The Ahn Trio are consummate musicians playing modern compositions. Some of these were written for them by their contemporaries. They also play transcriptions of great music. In this album, I especially liked the Piazzola pieces and a Leonard Bersteins Piano Trio which I suspect is not well known to chamber music afficionados. All in all, a great album. Highly recommended."
5,Plug in to this!,"The ahn trio is an amazing group whose sound at times is mesmerizing. Specifically, ""The Diamond World"" reaches tones that leave one shivering as the percussion not so subtly fills the background of the strings. The range of the artists on this piece alone makes the entire album worth owning. Likewise, all the pieces have a uniqueness to them that make this album worth several listens.Ken Resch"
4,A Teaching Book,"This book not only offers excellent writing exercises, it also includes the authors' examples so you can get a feel for how to make best use of the techniques described. I especially enjoyed the biography data sheets which help you to better understand your characters (or yourself!). This is a ""teaching"" book. Here, do this, it says, but goes on to show you how, step by step, which many books don't bother to do. The Writer's Path will keep you busy, entertained, and hopefully, writing better and better pieces."
4,Perfectly acceptable micro system,"Simple set-up.Sound is surprisingly good for such a budget-priced system.Excellent FM reception.Sleek, attractive design.Only complaint is that EQ feature gives limited choices of tone settings.Would have liked separate bass/treble controls.All-in-all very satisfied with the price and performance of this system, which we have in our kitchen and provides very good sound in small spaces."
3,Good for those with low expectations,"Make no mistake - the sound from this unit is not going to impress anybody, but then you get what you pay for. It's OK, but the bass is nowhere near as full as I expected after reading other reviews, and the tone ""adjustment"" is just a preset handful (maybe only 3, I can't remember) of treble/bass configurations. It's good for a small room where you don't care about great sound quality. It is compact and easy to use. I wish the speakers had a way of attaching to the body as it appears in the photos; it is awkward trying to move this thing around."
2,kabob skewer,"Only ""okay"" in my opinion. Separate spears tend to twist as you put on food. Cleans up easily."
3,for meta-pulp fans,"Malmont manages to pull off some neat tricks with this book. Using some of the classic pulp authors as his protagonists, he creates his own pulp about them -- a delicately over-the-top yarn full of larger-than-life villains, narrow escapes, square-jawed heroes, and a skin-of-their-teeth ending. And he does this all rather thoughtfully: he stays true (or true enough) to the pulp style while giving it his own, somewhat more modern spin.And he manages to blur his own lines of ""what's real and what's pulp?"" a few times as well.Overall? Entertaining."
2,Longest Runway in the World,"The story takes forever to take off, after an almost interminable, and, it seems to me, unnecessary, set up about pulps and pulp writing. The author appears to have little confidence in the reader's ability to figure out who the historical characters are and spends a lot of time making sure you are impressed by them. Perhaps if you are a big fan of this genre of writing, and know a lot about it, the book is more fun, just as stories at reunions are inevitably more interesting to the alumni than to the guests."
5,My kids love this book!,My two kids (ages 2 and 1) absolutley love this book. They love it so much that it literally got me through a 2 hour flight with no tears or fussing. We just kept reading it over and over and over. It's the first book my son wants to read in the morning.
4,Human Body,"Very helpful book for either young children studying at school, or even an adult who is new to anatomy and physiology. Came in condition as was told initially. Came within time frame stated. Would use supplier again, and would recommend supplier to others. Would recommend book for an easy introduction to the human body. All in all, very happy with. Thank you."
3,Not to be confused with Aircraft in Action Series,"This is a book to buy only since so little on this is available elsewhere. Many of the photos are very dark, hard to see detail in them. Not many of this unique flying boat were made, less than 500 of all varients.There should be more, clearer line drawings to show the aircraft, its turrets, variations in types. There is only 1 color photo, that is on the back. The author doesnt tell you how this plane compares to its US competion, the PBY Catalina or Japanese flying boats.I would guess that the quality of photos is poor since so few were taken of these birds in WWII and there is not much to choose from. As long as you understand this when purchasing this book, you will not be disappointed. I bought it solely to have some source material on this plane."
2,Inconsistent battery life,"I bought several of these and some stopped accepting a charge, while others work pretty well. Most of them don't perform as well as i had hoped."
1,Wake up Amazon,"Chimney starters are the only way to go for charcoal. However, do not by this one! As with another review, I also had one of the rivets holding the handle on pop. It also rusted out after the first use. BUY THE WEBER VERSION! I have now had the Weber version for over a year and it is still going strong with weekly use. Price is usually the same."
1,Look for another one,"I have had no problems with getting my charcoal lit, but the metal holding the handle isn't screwd in and it comes when lifted. I have to make sure I hold the handle at the very bottom so I don't drop the chimney.The design is fine, the construction is lacking..."
2,"Great darts, ridiculous price","I have these darts and they are really good, a five star item. Hasbro's website sells them for much less."
3,Don't bother with a 10-pack. Buy 100 for just 5x the cost.,"This link - [...] - will take you to a 100-pack of darts and ammo box. Trust me - you will need this many darts in the long run. Buy the 100 pack instead.Don't get me wrong - there is absolutely nothing wrong with these darts. They work fine. It's just that you're going to buy more darts as they get lost and damaged, so pony up the extra bucks now and save yourself money in the long run."
4,wwatch,good quality and value. Nice looking. Don't like the bi-lingual days of the week. Day and date are very hard to see
5,"Not Just Metal But Classic Rock, Grunge, Industrial And More...","The title is definitely misleading. If you are a fan of classic rock, hard rock, metal, glam, industrial and/or grunge, you should give this book a read. Everything from Sabbath to Megadeth to Nirvana to Carcass to Fear Factory to Motley Crue etc.... I have just one question. Marilyn Manson's ""Antichrist Superstar"" didn't make the top 500 but ""Mechanical Animals"" did. LOL How is that possible? Besides that, I really enjoyed this book. If you're a rocker, you'll love it."
5,CLASSIC!!!!,"well here it is the greatest mix of punk and ska around.this band has influenced so many bands(some good and some bad-for the bad look at the lame tribute album)op.ivy has to be one of my favourite bands of all time.i'll never forget the 1st time i heard them back in 92.i stole my ex-girlfriends tape and never gave it back cause it was so good.of course we all know tim(lint)and matt went on to form rancid(plus a couple others)jesse went on to form a few bands too but fell out of punk scence and dissappeared.(he's doing artwork for bands now-he's done artwork for rancid and alot of epitaph/lookout!bands too)alot of people compare todays ska to op.ivy(no doubt,goldfinger etc..)in my opinion the bands who pay more tribute to them are link 80,choking victim,and suicide machines.go by this album and go by seedy also,if you can(also op.ivy has alot more albums out but they are basically out of print..but sometimes you can find them,like lint rides again)"
5,An Ode to Matt Hensley,Scroll through the 50+ reviews and see that almsot everyone has given this five stars. why read another review? I have no answer for that.I got this Cd because I heard the majority of these tunes whilst seeing the H-street crew tear up the streets. Matt Hensley in particular carving a fullpipe and lipsliding the edge to the unequalled mind fusing power of 'knowledge'. At 15 I was so stoaked on these songs that I recorded the 5 or 6 on offer stright off the TV. I kept the tape until this year (at 27) when I got the CD.Take Warning...Take Warning!
3,overrated beyond belief,"This has got to be one of the most absurdly overrated albums in music history. It's not bad, and there's no doubting the committment and intensity of the band. But really, it's just 27 songs all following virtually the exact same blueprint. Musical arrangements are catchy but simplistic. The lyrics touch on some nice themes, but are trite. Unfortunately tinny production makes it sound like the instruments are being played out of a soup can.The ska-punk innovation business is also overplayed. Did The Specials ever exist??? They did it long before Op Ivy, and much better, with far more variety and maturity. Op Ivy has tons of energy but The Specials added to that energy genuine songcraft, something Op Ivy sorely lacks.There are nonetheless some killer moments on this CD: Sound System, Jaded, Big City, and Junkies Runnin' Dry are all superb. (I grow up too slow/I don't wanna go...) It's worth owning..."
1,Too bad u can't give ZERO stars.,"Ok, first off I didn't buy this cd. My ex-girlfriend left it at my house, and one day I decided to put it on. I can't believe they're so popular. The music sounds like it was recorded in a closet, and every song sounds exactly the same. I couldn't even FORCE myself to listen past the first five songs. And to top it off, the lyrics don't even make any sense. Some stuff about ""You can't get the top of the bottom of the barrel"". Oooh how deep! If u want REAL music with a message, and with a hi-quality sound, pick up the latest Limp Bizkit cd. Skip this trash."
5,Dental Help,"This product is a great help for cleaning under bridges, implants an older people's teeth that have openings between them. Easy to keep in pocket or purse. I have given them to patients an they love them.Dr. John M. Dickens"
3,plastic toothpicks,no splintering like wooden toothpicks. But you need to be careful because the brush end is fragile and breaks off easily. Poor design.
4,Hilarious Can!,"The packaging is probably the best part, but the nuts aren't bad either... The can has silly frog cartoons and text on it and is worth buying just for the novelty. The nuts are sweeter than I expected, basically honey-roasted peanuts with a crunchy wasabi and rice cracker coating. The wasabi coating is strong enough to make you sit up and take notice, but as is normal for wasabi, the heat doesn't last for more than a second or two. The only complaint I had with this product is how many broken pieces there were. Nearly 1/3 of the can was missing it's outer coating and the bottom of the can was full of coating ""crumbs"". Could have been shaken too much in shipping, so it might need some sort of filler inside the can to prevent movement."
5,Best HDD camcorder,"Best HDD camcorder that is not HD. I have owned tape and mini DVD camcorders in the past and they are a burden to say the least. 40 GB HDD is plenty space for recording. Colors are great and the 6.1 MP pictures are pretty good too. Only thing to remember is to manually adjust to Outdoors/Indoor for more accurate colors. It isn't a big deal but it will improve overall video. I personally love the infrared video capability, even though is a green video it is always good for filming were a light would not be practical ( like a baby's face when sleeping,etc). Overall, great camcorder, love the LCD touchscreen it is way better than I tought and the video on low light is decent altough I wish it was better. Hope it helps."
4,AMAZING,"It works SO GOOD, but the only problem is that it doesnt focus super fast. But. other than that, everything is super amazing!! totally worth the $$$!"
5,Great Product,"This video camera takes amazing footage, it has a generous amount features and effects that can satisfy most ""gadget"" people, but still can be easily operated by those who rather aim and shoot.Be warned there is quite a bit more to invest to actually make HD DVDs. You have to obtain a blu-ray DVD recorder (at least $500) and you must also own a blu-ray DVD player (or Playstation 3) for your HDTV.If you have it all, this product is excellent."
5,Everything you need to get started,"This kit includes all of the items you need to get started. This kit, along with the book, The Chinese Brush Painting Bible: Over 200 Motifs with Step-by-Step Illustrated Instructions will make you proficient at Chinese Brush Painting."
5,Take a Wonderful Trip - At Home!,"The content, editing and photography of the Visions of Europe series are unbelievable! What a terrific way to take an ""armchair vacation!"" Just turn off the PC, turn down the lights, and enjoy the sights, along with narration and music. They are not only informative, but educational - in a thoroughly enjoyable way. My husband and I will recommend them to everyone we know. Thank you, Amazon, for making these available.Visions of Europe"
4,Visions of Europe,"Beautiful pictures and at least it is my opinion that seeing things from the air vs. on the ground gives one more perspective. For whatever reason in the Italian series I was unable to view the Visions of Northern Italy part on my DVD. I even returned the whole series and got a new edition and the same thing happened. Every other disc worked except this one in both series, and I can think of no explanation. Just an aside. My only complaint is that I wished that the Visions of Europe covered more countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, etc. Hopefully, in the future the producers of this series will widen their horizons."
5,Awesome!,I just opened my chocolate lab. I love it! :D It is so silky soft! It is also in mint condition! :D
1,Very Disappointing!,"We bought each of our children several Webkinz for Christmas. Unfortunately, the website is racked with server problems, leaving me with several disappointed kids. There also seems to be no easy way to contact support or leave feedback at their site.Do yourself a favor, and stay away from these unless you want to be comforting your crying 3 year old for a present!"
5,aquis hair towel,"I'd had some Aquis hair towels for probably a couple of decades, but they're wearing out and are discolored. I was delighted to find that they're still made, and like the waffle design. They absorb water very well and are a good size for wrapping around the head."
4,can't live without it,My old Aquis towel has some mold on it..so time to order more. These weren't quite as heavy as my old ones but still a great way to keep my wet hair off my face and gets it drier than a regular towel.
3,COVERUP REVIEW,"The book that I have chosen for my project is called ""COVERUP."" My likes about this book are that it is a mystery and it sounds believable. This book sounds believable because it has political situations in it that could possibly happen. My dislikes are that the book wasn't very suspencful, in that, it gives away the end too soon. It also goes along very slowly.I think that the worst part of this book is in the beginning when Brad can't remember what happened to him after he went to a party with Alden, his best friend. This is because it moves along too slowly and it has a dark setting. The best part of the book is at the end because it's suspencful and it has an unsuspected person involved.The two most vivid parts of this book are the characters and the setting. The author uses very specific descriptions and pictures. I can see many scenes in the story."
5,An elegant collection of stories,"I'm not surprised to see this writer being written about in the big review newspapers such as The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. Adrianne Harun's THE KING OF LIMBO is a sublime collection of stories, haunting and elegant at the same time. Filled with unusual people, the reader can't help but feel a connection with these characters, even in the most unlikely of circumstances.I suspect we will be seeing great things from this writer for some time to come."
3,a great commentary poorly adapted to e book form.,This is one of the best devotional commentaries I have ever read. See his note on 5:19 for the best definition of worldliness you will ever find. Unfortunately you will have to scroll from the end one page at a time because there is no table of contents. Oh well. For such an obscure book to even find its way to Kindle at all is something to be grateful for regardless. Just leave plenty of bookmarks to allow for quick reference later. For the price it is well worth buying.
2,"Wrong, yes very wrong about Japan","An easy read to be completed by 2-3 hours. Entertaining yes, but it's always irritating when the writer completes a book without doing a proper research. too many facts in the books are wrong (maybe that's why the author picked the title?). Anyway, it's an easy and entertaing story about a relationship between a father and his teenage son. Their impression (and misinterpratations) of Japan are interesting, but don't buy this book if you live in Japan."
3,Not as good as his other works.,"I am very much a fan Carey's fictional works but found this one very hard to get into. Whilst I can appreciate much of what is written from, 1) The point of trying to connect with a somewhat estranged teenager (being a parent of one), and, 2) some of his insights (having lived in Japan for some time), I think there are other more worthy tomes that could be read before this one."
4,Your Path to Peace,"The Stewarts, authors of Your Way Home, are your guides to inner peace. They teach you how to create an ""inner"" sanctuary and home, whereever that may be.What I loved about this book is that it answered my questions, and I am sure the questions of many others, about how and why to integrate Feng Shui, NLP and other methods to create peaceful existence. Lou and Bruce Stewart tell you how and why as well as provide knowledge, based on their years of experience and practice, that helps improve the manner in which you live. They artfully blend together ancient practice (Feng Shui), which I now better understand, with contemporary advances. They use principles, exercises and personal stories to valaidate our home or place can be free of negativity.This is a unique book; it simplifies the complex and show you ways to adapt your environment so that you can continually experience inner healing and peace for your mind, body, and spirit. Buy this book and grow."
2,Not effective on eczema,"After the sudden onset of adult fingertip eczema, I tried this product. Unfortunately, even after regular (at least hourly) application over several months, it did not help resolve my condition. It is a nice ointment, with a not-unpleasant beeswax smell. It's a bit greasy, about what you'd expect with a soft beeswax. It softens the skin, but doesn't heal eczema."
5,Henrys a fool! buy 2 of this CD.,"whether you like rock or not, these songs have meaning. listen to the song instead of the music, and you'll experience total satisfaction. you'll probably even become their biggest fan!!!! greatest overall album I've ever heard."
1,such garbage..............,"well, one can only wonder what shakespeare or Jimi Hendrix would have made of this nonsense?not a band. not music. a fairly technically gifted output for a pointless philosophy.on the whole that would be okay in the spoken world, but to have to listen to it over and over again.....as Scott Stapp might say, Christ, Help us all!!!"
2,Wake up people,"For those of you who havent figured it out, I have 2 things to say. 1. Regardless what the band or their fans say, you cannot disregard their songs contents. This is a christian band. 2. For those of you who say, ""but it's good music,"" these guys are not covering any new ground. In fact this sound has been rehashed ad nauseum for almost the last 10 years. Even then it was old news."
3,sounds like alice or pearl jam to me,"altough this isn't a bad record , about half of the album is worth of listening completely , they sound too much like alice in chains and pearl jam or even stone temple pilots and that isn't a good thing 'cause they don't reach the quality of the first two , maybe they reach the third one , some of the songs are boring and stupid (unforgiven , ode) and some of the others get a little repetitive , the songs that are worth of listening completely are torn , sister(altough it has stupid lyrics but a very good guitar riff) , one and maybe my own prison and pity for a dime , expect a better effort from their next record. Mark tremonti is a very good guitarist."
5,it rocks my world!!!,I got this cd and weathered for my birthday 4 months ago and then human clay 2 months ago and havent taken them out of my stereo since their songs are awesome Scott Stapp singing and then Mark Tremonti on the guitar is the best thing that happened to music ill rate the songs from 1/10torn 9/10 okay but not one of their better songsode 8/10 its okaymy own prison 10/10 great songpity for a dime 10/10 i love this songin America 10/10 this song is about are freedomillusion9.5/10 kinda weirdunforgiven 9.8/10 this is a good song8/10 just plain weirdwhats this life for 10/10 i love this song a lot it starts of slow and gets faster awesome0ne 10/10 this song talkes about world unity wich we could have a little bit more ofin all i wish i could rate this higher but what do you do
3,Great song... not-so-great cd!,"IN this cd i find one of the greatest songs ive ever listened to. It has a great balance of heart and soul mixed with pure emotion. The song was ""My own prison."" However, the cd did not recieve 5 stars from me because of the lack of the same emotion in the other 9 songs! I felt some of them where just plain space savers while others simply couldnt live up to My own prison. Dont get me wrong.. i enjoyed the cd to an extent, but i just feel that my own prison was really the only song worth purchasing...The song is great... the cd isnt!"
5,"Very good, different variety of songs!!","Bery good Cd. If you listen through the whle thing you will like almost every song. Favorites for me are Pity For a Dime, Whats This Life For, My Own Prison, One, and Torn, but all of them are very good!!"
5,Stop Comparing,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this CD. However, I do not think that this sounds even remotely like Pearl Jam. The harmonies and structures are much clearer in this CD than in any other PJ. If you like true music, get this CD."
5,The band i have ever listened to before in my life!!!!!!!!!!,"I extremly recommend this cd to anyone! This is one of the best cd's i have EVER listened to in my life. The have one of the best vocalist in the world, including a kick *#$ guitarist, drummer, and bass player. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!"
1,I THINK IM GONNA HURL,"MAN THESE GUYS ARE ANNOYING. WELL MAYBE NOT AS BAD AS THERE FANS AND WELL CERTAINLY NOT AS IRRITATING AS SAPP IS.PLEASE SCOTT STAPP OR SAPP WHATEVER ,TRYING TO IMMITATE MORRISON .THATS THE LEAD SINGER FOR THE DOORS CREED FANS.HOW OBNOXIOUS CAN THIS GUY BE.STOP ACTING LIKE JIM STOP TRYING TO SOUND LIKE KURT COBAIN.THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL CORN. GO DO A DUET WITH CHER OR MICHAEL BOLTON JUST GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ROCK."
1,bland moral-obscessed drivel.,"Creed is a christian band. they play songs that go against sin, abortion, and all those evil things that humans do. on top of that, they have such a set formula of writing and composing music that it isn't even interesting. i would give this zero stars, but the song ""my own prison"" redeems it enough to justify having to use the lowest rating and yet give it some merit."
1,If wishes were horses...,"Man, I wish I had a deep, booming voice and three guys with typical rock instruments so that I could become a generic, faceless, soulless grunge/metal band with nothing to offer in the way of new music to the world and be dull and lifeless and yet somehow make millions of dollars and recognition and top it off by not being sued by Pearl Jam or Soundgarden. Man, that'd be sweet."
5,a must have,creed is a great band with a bright future. a little bit of a eddie vedder sounding voice and a rage of emotions. if you don't have this album get it.
5,You need to own this prison!,"What can I say? Wow, what a great CD. I have loved Creed's CD My Own Prison for so long, but I finally found a better CD. This limited edition which includes their song Bound and Tied from the Dead Man On Campus soundtrack is a spiritual journey from start to finish; almost a rewarding CD one might say. Bound and Tied adds so much to this CD, for it is yet another gritty, toe-nail curling grunge song from the Tallahasse band Creed."
4,Undeniably Good,"Despite some negative reviews, Creed's 'My Own Prison', is an excellant CD. Sure sounds are similar to Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Days of the New etc., but ultimately all music resembles a predecessor. It's not ripping off it's called inspiration. Creed's first album has many stirring lyrics that cut through the materialism in life and get to a point that everyone, whether Christian or not, can relate to. in addition they have an excellent sense of musical style that combines spectacular accoustic guitar with good the ol' plugged in sound. Creed deserves a serious listen by everyone.Of note are 'In America', 'What's This Life For?', and 'Pity for a Dime'."
4,this is a great album,"i love this album but there is one song that just doesn't sound great. But for being their first album it is wonderful. I especially love the songs What's this life for, My own prison, and torn."
1,Great cover!,"One of those rare CDs where the cover perfectly depicts the likely reaction of a listener to hearing the ""music"" within."
1,Enjoy the radio play but don't waste your money.,"Like many who threw their money away on this CD, I bought it on the strength of the first single release, ""My Own Prison."" Not a bad track, though the lyricwriting was pretty poor (the guy has no sense of meter or phrasing). The only way I can figure this band's success is good marketing: the label releases the sound-alike singles far enough apart that people forget they heard the same song under a different title 4 weeks ago. Other than marketing, the massive, grunge bass sound is the only thing this band has going for it. I sold my copy to a used record store 2 weeks after I bought it, and I predict that's what will happen with most copies. Creed is a thoroughly forgettable band."
1,Scott Stapp: My hero!!,Creed's over rated music sounds much like a wet fart after a night out drinking lots of Guinness and chain swallowing chicken wings.... can you feel the wind scotty??? does it take you higher??
4,Still Their Best Album,"This rock album is absolutely wonderful. You won't need the skip-track button because every song is great!Overall it's a dark album. 'Dark' meaning the songs are, well, not happy. The first song (and my personal favorite) ""Torn"" starts off with a beautiful, lonely sounding clean guitar riff before moving on to hard and angry electric guitar riffs. This song really sets the tone for how much of the album sounds. At times you're hearing nice acoustic riffs like the beginning of ""Pity For a Dime"" (song #4). Other times you're exposed to harder electric guitar riffs like ""Ode"" (#2). And Scott Stapp's vocals go along nicely with the music.The end result is a very enjoyable listening experience that should keep you entertained throughout the entire 49min+ CD.I highly recommend checking this one out."
4,Decent,"Compared to most of what's out there today this might seem like the band to save rock as many people obviously do. However if this CD was released in say, 1993 it might have gotten some airplay and gone gold but would have been forgotten in the brillance of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden. That being said for what is out there right now this is pretty good and has some quality songs. It's too bad Creed faltered on it's next album because they had potential to become really good."
2,Probably accurate... terrible book.,"This book had a ton of nitty gritty detail about the weapons systems. The author obviously knows his stuff technically. But this is simply a terrible read. Take the plot from Top Gun and transfer it to tanks and you have this book down pat.New guy comes into platoon, shows up other hot shot, superfluous love story, war breaks out, hot shot becomes hero, saves other hot shot.... blah blah. You've seen it all before.There is little character development. Every character was a stereotype. It was just such a clichéd plot that I couldn't wait for it to end. It did, with a rather unsatisfying result. Don't waste your time unless you are actually a tank soldier and want to know how to behave like a jerk."
5,Brilliant book through eyes of a legend,"Lemmy Kilmister is a legend for the music, but also his attitude, like he said 'I dont drive a porsche', although he is a living legend. The book gives an great view of music through the 60's and 70's. The best thing about this book is how it gives you that knowledge of what was behind the music when they made it. You find out all those things from Lemmy, the rumours such as his poisinous blood.I flew through this book just wish there was more."
1,Ripped off,"I got this CD so I could listen to the words of some famous Hawaiian songs. This CD is ALL INSTRUMENTAL even though that's not indicated anywhere on the information page here. Not only that - is says it's by ""Various Artists"". I don't think so. Every song sounds like the same steel guitar playing the melody and the same small rhythm section playing in the background. You'd like this CD if that's what you want to hear, but that's NOT what I wanted to hear."
4,Great product!,"We bought one of these and are very happy with it. It really looks great. We have a small deck, and a storm door wouldn't fit well. This was the perfect solution.Make sure to be careful when you make your measurements. I must have miscalcluated because ours was about 1"" too short for our door. But we made it fit with some strapping.The installation isn't too complicated, but you will need a good hack-saw to cut the parts to the correct sizes for your door.The only downside is that its a really powerful spring. So if you've never used it before, it sometimes slips out of your hands and slams shut. But once you learn how it works, its not an issue.I looked everywhere, and Amazon had the best price."
1,Very difficult installation,"I don't know who wrote the other reviews but over the years we have installed several retractable screen doors in different homes. This product was poorly made, instructions minimal and difficult. The clincher was the weather strip that the instructions stated to simply snap into place. It wasn't the weather strip that snapped, it was my husband trying to snap the cheap weather strip into the cheap frame, and I have seen him take on intricate and difficult construction projects as a contractor. Not pleased at all with this item, I will update with a better brand when I find it for our next door."
5,Excellent!,"This is my kind of CD! It's so versatile that can listen to it while doing various activities. It's suitable for reading, studying, or relaxing by the fire after a long day at work. This is my first exposure to Acoustic Alchemy, but I plan to add more of their work to my CD collection."
5,Yummy!!,"I REALLY like the taste of these chips!! They are something I crave after having them. Good and salty taste -- The only thing is that there's not enough in a package, but that's okay since I can just grab another one ... that is, if you get a package like me :-)"
3,"Too lite for me, possibly good for others","I browsed through this at a bookstore recently, and saw that many pages had lists like:Click on File->OpenChoose this optionChoose that optionPress this buttonSigh, I don't like it when a book states what should be obvious.This book is too low-level for my needs. Granted, I'm looking for a book that assumes that I know .NET and SQL Server already, so this may be appropriate for someone else. I just wanted to get a book that would give a good overview of the architecture, and then let me start using it ASAP. This is not quite it."
2,not very happy,"I thought I bought the watch that you are showing but the watch I got on the face of it its not blue like you show. The numbers are very hard to read for my husband., and it already fell of the clip ."
5,Great Book!,"We did this book at our church for a Wed night Bible Study. It is a wonderful book. Our catchphase is now ""dont take the bait. Seller did a great job of getting it to me for my daughter. Everything was as it should be."
5,Life changing,I didn't realize how changing my perception changed the way I reacted to every situation. I am truly a happier person for having read (and recieved) this teaching.
5,THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!,If you want to learn to forgive this is the right book for you. It convicts and corrects all in one book. I was hooked from chapter 1 on.This book will help you let go of offenses and live more free instead of being bound by the circumstances of this life. Read it and be blessed!
1,Be very very careful,"If you read this book, you need to be very careful and should also read other books on spiritual abuse. This book is very close to being cultish, this is my strong warning. Be alert if your church leader requests you read this book without also recommending others, as this book could easily be used to justify spiritual abuse.His basic point is that taking offense is the bait of satan to lure you to do wrong things. There is some truth in this, one's offended ego can be used to try to justify sin. But there is also great danger in this teaching, in that it seems to teach that if one is EVER offended, it is your fault. For example, this book teaches that if I am offended by this book, (and I am) then it is my fault and I need to repent.Jesus got offended sometimes and we should also. One reason I am offended by this book is that it can easily be used to ""guilt"" people who have done nothing wrong."
1,Disappointing,I love the look of this boot and it was comfortable but whatever material it's made of cracks with your movement so the boot had cracks all over it after minimal wears.
2,Doesn't work well on flexible plastic nor tarps,"To be fair it does work very well on paper and cardboard, which might be its primary goal.But it doesn't work any type of flexible plastic such as tarps or thick garbage bags. You can see the impression of the hole punch, stretched into the surface of the plastic. And sometimes on an outdoor tarp it might cut a little bit of the circle out, but never a nice punched hole.I don't think it's a problem with the strength of the tool, I think there's enough leverage. But I suspect the edges of the punch and socket don't line up close enough to cut. Just a guess.I did work OK on rigid clear plastic.And of course Amazon's no hassle return policy is an easy fix."
2,Does not fit!!!,"Even though it says it's for a 2004 Grand Prix, it is not correct. The 2004+ cars need another bracket welded on the strut. The item is very nice, but just isn't for my car. I have to return them."
5,Good find!,This is the best book I know to help sufferers understand their anxieties and panic. I have recommended it to many people.
1,where?,Funny how amazon asks for a review of an item they should know they have not shipped yet??? Thanks for wasting my time.
1,DID NOT ORDER THIS A SECOND TIME,DID NOT ORDER THIS A SECOND TIME. PURCHASED IT MONTHS AGO AND RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. SOMEONE SCREWED UP AND SENT IT TO ME THIS TIME FOR NO REASON AND WAS NOT EVEN CHARGED FOR IT. YOUR SYSTEM IS BREAKING DOWN.
5,Classic reading from decades ago,"I read this in High School back in the 70's. This is such a good / classic book. It is far better in my opinion than subsequent books by Carlos (""Journey_to_Ixtlan"" and ""A Separate Reality"" are good but not this good in my opinion. All are good and perhaps because I read the Teachings 1st it had more of an impact.... Mind opening!"
5,The pause that refreshes,"This book gave me exactly the same feeling as watching a favorite old movie on television--it's funny and charming and well-crafted, and I put it down feeling like all was right with the world. Excellent!"
1,Worthless,"It has been a while since 1948, when five Arab nations launched an attack on Israel. The purpose of the attack was not to protect anyone. It was to obliterate human rights of Jews in the region. In effect, the Arabs were fighting for pride while the Jews were fighting for their lives. Not surprisingly, the Jews fought harder. And the Jews won.Now some scholars have decided that the time has come to deny all this and rewrite this history, claiming not only that the Jews were arrogant aggressors, but that most Jews conspired to tell the same lies about it. It certainly serves no purpose to blame the victims of the Arab invasion in such a manner. If the cause the authors are fighting for loses, what will they have accomplished? If their cause wins, they will have struck a very counterproductive blow against scholarship, justice, and human rights."
1,Duro-Med Elbow Protector,"The picture of these elbow protectors gives the impression that they are securely held in place and provide significant protection. Both are just illusions. The ""padding"" is just for show. A sweater provides better protection. The protector will stay in place as long as you don't move your arm. Otherwise it will move very quickly down the arm until it completely exposes the elbow. These are not inexpensive, they are CHEAP! In my case they are completely useless and a waste of money."
5,Works Good Area Volume!,"I bought this mic half-heartedly. It might possibly be complete junk, or might possibly be one of my greatest buys. And sure enough. It was a great buy. This mic is very very good for what I plan to use it for. I, sadly, have yet to test it out on a camcorder, but I have used it plugged into my computer and receive, nothing below, AMAZING sound quality from this mic. It has a very wide area pick up also, which I was very surprised with for its price. I am not sure about how it reacts to picking up DV Tape sound or that stuff, because I use it on a boom pole. This is a great item and well worth it if your on a budget for filming or voice over. The VO is pretty awsome with this thing. There is no noticeable white noise and the actually QUALITY of the recordings are just clear and normal. There is nothing that makes it sound like it couldn't be from a professional studio. Made my day. Great buy for the price!"
1,No better than on-board mic,"Couple strange things with this shotgun mic:1) Works without battery, and battery seems to do nothing at all when installed.2) There is no audible difference between the low- and high-band settings. None at all.I don't know if I got a dud or what, but this microphone performs no better the on-board mic with my camera. Invest elsewhere."
1,No.,"To start off, I am using a Canon Rebel T3i, (EOS 600D) and I have compared audio samples from both the SMX-10 and the internal stereo microphones nearly side by side (I alternated the footage I was reviewing). It is terribly clear:The internals provide less background noise than the SMX-10, even when the latter is in background noise reduction mode.Also, the microphone itself provides no way to display low battery. The ""wind cover"" is mediocre and feels very able to be teared when being put on.All in all, leave this mic alone with the EOS 600D and 550D, probably the new T3 too."
2,Australia is really like this!!,"Just what the world needs, an album that reinforces that Australians are a bunch of hillbilly crocodile hunter types.Anyone who has travelled to Australia knows that is only partly true....I have never heard people sing these songs!!"
1,Useless w/o Medela Bra,This is useless w/o a Medela Bra. In stead I purchased the Made by Moms Pumping Band and I love it.
3,Poetry In Song,"After reading a number of very positive reviews in the English music press, and seeing Ys at a very good price in a favorite CD store, I decided to indulge my taste for the unusual and take the Newsom plunge. And I found that while the CD is enjoyable on a certain level, it isn't at all what I expected.When I first heard Newsom sing, I immediately thought of Melanie, who was moderately popular back in the early 70s. A friend said Rickie Lee Jones, and other reviewers have mentioned Bjork, Loreena McKinnett and Joni Mitchell. Well maybe there are elements of all those women in Newsom's voice, but where are the melodies?Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Ys. But it seems to me that it is a collection of poetry put to free-form song. I got much more enjoyment from the CD while simultaneously reading the lyrics!Ys is not for the masses, but if your tastes lean toward the arcane and the outre', then you might find a lot of listening pleasure here. I'm eager to hear what she comes up with next!"
1,Unlistenable. Worst Singing Ever.,"Her singing is terrible: Off key, out of tempo, with a a croaking crow-like sound that makes me embarrassed for her.I threw it away except for the cover and booklet."
3,"She's worth the hype, but this record isn't","After several listenings, I feel that all the attention given to Joanna Newsom's recent album, Ys, is misplaced. It is true that this latest record is unlike almost anything out now. But I think there are a lot of people who missed the boat with her earlier album, The Milk-Eyed Mender, in one of two ways who are trying to make up for their inattention. People either weren't aware of the album and want to feel dialed in now, or they couldn't hack Newsom's complicated writing and playing and especially her unique and aggressive singing, which is toned down and muted by the layers of Van Dyke Parks' orchestrations on the new record.Don't get me wrong, Ys is a decent record and I'll keep listening to it for a while, and maybe I'll grow to like it more. But if you like The Milk-Eyed Mender, know that this new work is a different, and, dare I say, diluted version of her talents."
3,"Workaround for the ""first song"" bug","Although I like the design of the JBL On Time clock radio, I had the same problem with others in that I could not set the alarm to play a specific song on the ipod nano. It just played the first song in the library over and over and over again. The workaround was to set the ipod to shuffle mode. Now I get a random song when the alarm goes off."
4,A look into the young Serbian soul.,"Don't be worried by the description ""Dance"" music. You won't find any window-shattering, body-shaking beats on this compilation. Instead, hear what the artists have to say for themselves in this well-thought blend of Electronica/Trance. The last sentence on the back of the album describes their music as a ""100% adrenaline-free collection of tunes from the place where apathy meets devastation..."" This selection offers an inviting look into the young musical soul of Serbia. The trance-like sounds were better than I thought, and offered a richer mix of emotions than I had come to expect from modern 'Balkan' music. I only gave this a 4 because I had hoped to hear a few traditional Serbian sounds. This is definitely modern, definitely Euro - but definitely not Euro-trash!"
4,An Artist in Inspired form,"What I love about this CD is how different each song is from the original. Using the original, as an artist uses a piece of canvas, Bobby Broom then proceeds to go and roam far and wide, taking his band members with him, but always returning to the original interpretation, as to remind the listener of it's existence. My personal favourites are `House of the Rising Sun, I will, Stand', but I normally let the whole CD play and just enjoy. It took me a while to get into, but I'm glad I made the effort."
3,Maybe a 3.5,"First of all, I agree with the other reviewers who say that this is not an SF novel. I think it comes closest to being a horror novel. Since the book was written in the 70's and set in that time, it can seem a bit dated in spots. Two of the main characters are a Jew and a gay man. While the way Silverberg talks about these groups is not bigoted, neither is it as carefully PC as a modern author might be. Again, I chalk this up to the time in which it is set and written. About 2/3 of the book is the road trip the 4 characters take and the last 1/3 takes place after they arrive at their destination. The book is written in the alternating POV's of the 4 main characters. Personally, I didn't think their voices were all that distinct from one another, so I had to keep reminding myself who was whom. The road trip part dragged a bit for me in places, but things definitely get more interesting when they arrive at their destination. I liked it OK, but I didn't love it."
3,Sex and skulduggery,"I like Silverberg's work, and have read a number of his books, so it's somewhat disappointing that this one left me strangely unmoved. TBoS starts out well and shows great promise at the start. The writing style is deceptively straightforward, the prose clear and precise. The foundation for a fascinating mystery is well-laid. Unfortunately predictability soon sets in which gradually dilutes the story's effectiveness. As we get to know the four would-be immortals it becomes clear what the outcome will be. Although the backstories are for the most part interesting some sections feel almost superfluous and I can't help but think that this might have worked better as a pared-down novella. Despite this, however, its never dull, it's just that I was left feeling somewhat ambivalent rather than fulfilled."
5,How to receive God's Promises in your life,"This book, in Mr. Hayes' usual manner, is very straight forward. It shows through scripture and example how obedience and worship will put you in the position to receive all the promises of God that you are wondering why you are missing. This book shows that God is there, we just need to move ourselves a little. A must read for thoese who want to receive what God has for them."
4,Neato!,The sproingy tongy things aren't as strong/stiff as I'd thought BUT it's not something that can't be worked around. I've tried to flip a burger by grabbing it WIDTH wise but it works so much better if I grab it flipper wise.Great for scrambling eggs & mixing chocolate milk.
3,High-energy mainstream jazz trio,"Pianist Paul Smith is a powerhouse jazz pianist, albeit in a conservative harmonic context. Bellson and Brown are quite capable of keeping up with him. Playing time is about 35 minutes, brief by modern standards. The tracks alternate between upbeat stomps and relaxed ballads.1. The Lady Is a Tramp - 4:232. Yesterdays - 5:303. Everything Happens to Me - 3:384. On a Clear Day - 3:485. The Surrey With the Fringe on Top - 3:246. My Heart Stood Still - 5:527. Chicago - 3:338. Lover - 4:43"
5,Love these bad boys!,"I love these boxers, and these are actually my second purchase of this same product.I've always been a cotton guy I guess just because I didn't know any better. These are actually a bargain for 3 pairs at 50$. Most other silk boxer brands are 20-ish, making this a great buy. On top of that the quality is much higher than you might expect. I've actually turned three of my guy friends on to these because of the quality and comfort.I would highly recommend them to anyone as a purchase for yourself, or a special gentleman. The only problem- You won't want to wear anything else!"
2,Music 10;Sound Quality 1,"This is some of the swingingest big band jazz you'll ever hear--that is, if you can hear it over the crackling. If you still enjoy listening to your worn out LP's then by all means by this disc. If ,like me,you have a hard time enjoying music, even great music, when it's accompanied by the annoying sounds of worn out vinyl then stay away from this one."
5,Set a spell and tap your toes,"Jorma hits a home run with this release. If this doesn't get the juices flowing, you are already dead! This is a masterpiece in every sense. Sit back and enjoy this collection of chicken fried country classics and bluesy finger pickin jams."
1,Kingston faucet,Faucet is almost black instead of the oil rubbed look we thought it would be. The faucet is very small with thin small handles and looks cheap. It was cheap in price so I guess I got what I paid for in the end. I will replace this one in the near future
2,Disappointing,"If you have ever done any basic sewing at all, this book will most likely disappoint you. While it does contain some very helpful resources for materials, and a few pointers on VERY basic construction, the majority of the book is a series of photos of the same few steps over and over again, with a few finished garments thrown in for kicks. The book has several very basic patterns which (unless by some stroke of luck you're proportioned exactly like the model) would only be useful to someone who's made or altered patterns before, but the book contains NO information on fitting techniques or altering patterns for use in latex. My opinion is that it's worth about half of the list price, and mostly for the list of materials suppliers."
2,Not Worth the Money.... Unless....,"I just popped in Archives yet again... after a few years of owning it, and it remains just as bland and disappointing as it was before. Shockingly enough, I am a die-hard fan... but this set just makes me want to die. It reminds me of a murky Dead Can Dance hang over. Before I bought this two-piece set, I thought I wanted to own every scrap of material from Delerium, and while this is an intriguing set historically, it reminds me of a dull history course which explains the precursor to the main event. I do, however, agree with other reviewers that those who are very much into extremely dark gothic will find this album of interest."
4,Hello????,I think the two people below have written false reviews or maybe they have a different version of the cd. I have this cdand it has only two tracks. Should've had more if you ask me.1. Cry2. Someday We'll Know
1,Too many brand name ingredients!!!,"I didn't keep this book because of all the brand name ingredients. Maybe that isn't a problem in US, but here in Canada we don't have any specialty low-sodium products. Almost all the recipes require some of these products. I was looking for a natural, whole foods cookbook. This isn't it.If you are not in USA, this book would be worthless. If I make the recipes with regular canned goods, they would be LOADED with sodium.I guess I'll have to keep looking...."
3,Carrot sticks are not a recipe,"While the bread selection is extensive and there are many good suggestions for dinners, I was disappointed when I discovered that one of the recipes in the cookbook was for carrot sticks. It is not the only self-explanatory ""recipe"" given. I was hoping for a few more lunch and dinner suggestions that would allow me to enhance my dad's low sodium dining days."
5,A great low sodium-salt diet book.,"The No-Salt, Lowest-Sodium CookbookMy sister has congestive heart failure and I got this book for her and me both. It explains what congestive heart failure does to your body and also has some wonderful recipes for people that want to cut down on the salt and sodium. A great book..."
2,Went back to Norton,"Hard to use if you're just a novice. My wife had a real hard time with it, but it did protect us well for the year we used it. When I tried to uninstall it from my wife's laptop it did not uninstall all the way and screwed the registry up causing the computer to take an extremely long tome to initialize. Tried re-installing so I could once again try to remove smoothly and it wouldn't even re-install."
1,Works great when it works,"I received this player for my b-day a year ago. Starting about 6 months ago, it has stopped reading some discs if there were scratches on the disc (the discs could be read by 3 computer DVD drives worth a third of the money). It seems to have gotten pickier as time has gone by. When it does work, the picture and sound quality are great, but that is only about 60% of the time right now."
3,Hockey,My 12 year old wanted a tabletop hockey so bad for CHristmas. He got this and at first was a little disappointed because a little awkward to use. Almost returned it but he ended up getting used to it. Kind of hard to score but overall not too bad. He's happy with it and for the price its adequate.
1,Do not buy,Very poorly made.The players get stuck in the grooves.After 3 games 2 players stopped working (stopped turning around).My son was really disappointed.
3,Okay read.,"I have been faithfully reading all the Charmed books as I love the TV series.This book was okay, but disappointing compared to other book which have been written.Based during Halloween, it centres on CK and the power which she has unleased after casting a spell to bring back the love of her life who died but by doing so it could essentially mean that the realms of dead and the un-dead could collaspe.The story idea was good, but I wasn't drawn into the storyline which seemed boring and drawn-out. I didn't feel a connection to the characters (not even the sisters who seemed like words on a page, instead of being able to picture it in your mind) and I could wait to reach the end of the book so it was over.Overall I wouldn't recommend it unless perhaps it is Halloween and there is nothing else for you to read or if you are an avid Charmed fan."
5,Wonderful Gift,This is a beautiful watch. I purchased it for my husband for our anniversary. I would recommend it.
4,Comfy,"I wasn't expecting much from this skirt as I bought it for a themed party and wasn't planning on wearing it again. However, after wearing it just that once, I realized that it was actually pretty comfortable and I wanted to keep it. Not only did I keep it, but I wear it around as a casual, comfortable skirt. My only complaint is that it is a bit long - I am 5'8"" and the skirt still falls below my knees. I would have preferred it to hit just above."
4,Sense of humor required,"This is one of the best-loved D&D sourcebooks of all time - a thoughtful, but thoroughly humorous, in-depth look at the personalities of the Orcs of the Broken Lands. You get lots of horrible jokes and genuinely hilarious situations, plus endless reams of lore... how to run humanoid PCs, notes on religion, language, combat, chieftans, heroes, adventures, history, magic, treasures, and yes, Orc Wars, the tabletop game!"
1,Not Interested!,"I just encountered this author at a bookstore at The Grove in Los Angeles. Apparently she thought she did the store a favor by signing several copies of her book while there with a friend. This would be fine, except when faced with a long line of patiently waiting patrons at the cash register; her friend approached the register and asked that she be able to circumvent the line since she just signed some books. Ironically when I first saw her signing the books, I was a bit curious and contemplated reading a copy, but now I am wary of it's source. Does she think she's better than the rest of us because she wrote a book? Since she obviously thinks her status as an author makes her a person who deserves ""celebrity treatment"" maybe she should be a bit more discerning and humble in her public behavior. It may make HER more interesting."
5,An amazingly good album.,"Wow, this is a suprisingly very good album. After I heard ""Save Yourself"", one of the best songs and the first single, I immediately listend to the other tracks and was really blown away. The songs are very well written and it just seems the band really took the time to make everything just as good as the others. Honestly, I usually don't listen to this type of music, except Incubus.Highlight tracks include: ""Weight of the World"", ""Save Yourself"", ""Beatles Song"", ""Fun Never Ends"", and ""What Never Dies"".I admit, a lot of these songs are poppy, but honestly, they are extremely well done and you should give them a chance.If you like Incubus, or any other band in that category, then give this cd a listen."
2,Not really worth the effort to read,"As a former federal law enforcement officer, I will simply say there are just much better books to read on this subject."
5,Great guide to concealed handgun responsibility !!,"This is a comprehensive manual, appropriate for beginner, intermediate and experienced handgun owners whether they have a concealed weapons carry permit or not. It underscores safety, describes numerous experiences, handles the tough ""what if"" questions, and has individual state information. Don't let the cover picture fool you... this is a book for men or women. Something in this book will hit on something you didn't know. Now it just needs a chapter on ""How to get your significant other to read this book""..."
4,Good book,Good if you are about to or have recently bought a handgun. Chapter on holsters is boring but only because I knew I wouldn't need one (I keep mine in my shoulder bag). I bought a holster and used fabric glue to secure it to the inside of the bag.
5,Christmas come to life through music,This music is beautifully conducted and completely justifies the beauty of the Nutcracker Suite. From the gallop of Drosselmyer and the march of the children to the arrival in the kingdom of sweets. If there ever was a perfect christmas CD this one leaves it far behind!
1,Not Worth The Price,This program is a simple Wav Editor. No way to save your final results. Only available option is to send to their website and then download to your phone. I wonder how many other people share your ringtones. I did not find it to be compatible with my Motorola RAZR nor with T-Mobile as advertised. Agent469.
3,Needs to be improved,"I have this...product is unique in decoration line, but when power-off in any reason you need to setting up again, because clock does not have backup battery inside."
1,Harmful product-creates vitamin E imbalance,"This is another garbage product from ""Nature Made"", one of the worst supplement manufacturers there is.This product contains only alpha tocopherol. The problem is that truly natural vitamin E is a COMPLEX of 8 different types. There are 4 tocopherols (alpha, beta, delta, gamma), and 4 tocotrienols (alpha, beta, delta, gamma) that make up the vitamin E complex.This product contains large amounts of ONLY alpha tocopherol. The problem this creates is that it induces a functional deficiency of the other 7 types of vitamin E.And these other 7 types have unique and important biochemical functions. Gamma tocopherol, for example has critically important free radical quenching functions that are not provided by alpha tocopherol.Hence, this product is DAMAGING to your health.If you want to obtain the true benefits of vitamin E, you must take a full spectrum vitamin E complex, that contains all 8 forms of the vitamin."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Worse people to deal with....,It took almost 2 months before I received the stuff i ordered and of course I was pissed off i gave them a negative feedback....and here comes the harrassment form Dealway (MAtt). First he said I will refund me if I remove my feedback (just a feedback not a real review yet FYI). He kept sending me emails to remove it and saying he refunded me already and then after few days later charged me again. All i'm saying here just beware of this seller. Don't have problem with the product it just how they conduct their business that's really pissed me off. Non stop emails and just keep harrassing you to remove your feedback. For Matt of Dealway if you want to receive a positive feedback to your business right and stop harrassing people.
1,Do not buy this comforter,This comforter looks nice and is very comfortable but is very cheaply made. One of the throw pillows's seam opened after 2 days and the comforter was pretty much ruined after one cleaning.
5,Best servos ever.,These are great servos. Get them. Work great in any plane. Prices vary so look around and fine the best deal
1,Tiel tip on this book,"The Cockatiels (Complete Pet Owner's Manual's) was not as informative as I liked it to be. If you want tips on taming and training do not get this book! However the pictures were great! It is informative about the accomadations, breeding and healing but doesn't say anything about teaching how to get the bird to do things like: somersaults, picking things up and placing them somewhere else and other training items. I recomend going to a bookstore and looking through the books to make sure you want it and it has what you want in it. Better yet go to a pet store, they have many books on pets that you have and you can read through it. Petco and Petsmart are the best places to go look at. They also have pletny of other things for your tiel."
4,Practical Advice,"I found this book written simply and very practical in the advice given to those guiding others in the spiritual journey. This book does not delve into the realm of theory but remains very concrete which is what I needed when I found myself too busy to read long explanations. Starting from everyday experience, the author concentrates on relationships and building up those relationships. He gives us criteria for evaluating our religious experiences while keeping our balance. A great approach and very helpful. thank you."
1,Amazing,"The author of this work has a sensitive ear for how business words are misused in popular speech and journalism, but seems to be unaware of the meaning of many terms as properly used by businessmen. I cannot see the value that any businessman or banker would get out of this work. It's value may be found by PR professionals, journalists, demagogues, sociologists, and students of language and popular error. I stubled across this in my efforts at Wiktionary and was appalled at how far removed the definitions were from the meanings I found through my reasearch in serious works of business and finance."
3,PL/SQL content rushed and insufficient,"This book is indeed a great introductory book for SQL. Unfortunately, it is advertised as an introductory guide to PL/SQL. If you are new to SQL this is a great beginner's guide. However, you already know SQL and would like to dwelve into the world of PL/SQL find another book!"
4,Excellent PL/SQL Starter book,"I'm just getting started with this book. I also have several other Oracle and SQL books. This looks like a good way to get my feet wet. I have worked in IT for 17 years, doing everything from teaching to OS/390 systems work to networking & cisco routers, now Oracle & PL/SQL. I like the approach this book takes. It is a good choice for experienced IT professionals new to this area.Thanks! Keith"
4,"Honeysuckle, Funnysuckle","I love the richnees of all Claus Porto soaps. They lather like a dream and are usually heaven-scented. However this scent, Honeysuckle is a little off or maybe a bit over-powering for my taste. It's extremely heady, unlike the real thing. I finished the bar, combining it with Haute Tub, Body Butter Scrub in Samsutra Orange and it was a wonderful pairing. I won't buy this scent again, but I'll definitely try a different one."
5,What is not to like?,"I laughed, I cried, I pondered. Many explorations within and without ensued from the reading. I looked at the world with different eyes after reading it and the difference has continued. What more could I ask for? Great Literature?"
2,"Interesting Ideas, Bad Writing","Ken Wilber has a lot to say. More importantly, much of it is worth hearing. But with Boomeritis he's once again demonstrated that his talents lie more in theorizing and synthesizing than in translating and popularizing. If Wilber's ideas are ever to reach a wider audience (which I believe they should) he'll need to become much more accessible to the intelligent general reader or find a collaborator who can do this for him. Those interested in exploring Wilber's ideas would do much better to skip Boomeritis and get a copy of A Brief History of Everything."
3,Not as luxurious in person but does the job,Bought as a gift and it served it's purpose although it wasn't quite as nice in person as the picture looks - overall ok though.
3,LITTLE BIT,"THE SET ITSELF WAS NICE, BUT THE GLOVES ARE TOO BIG, I AM A SMALL LADY AND THE HAT AND SCRAF WERE FINE, BUT THE GLOVES ARE SUPER BIG ON ME AND I CAN'T WEAR THEM WHEN I WEAR THE SET, MAYBE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING THEM A LITTLE SMALLER FOR SMALL WOMEN LIKE ME. THANKS"
2,American Boy,It was not so good because it did not end well. It had a weird ending. Confusing at times.
1,Does not work well with Logitech V270 Mouse,"I bought this product with the Logitech V270 Mouse. First off, download the latest drivers, do NOT use the ones packaged with the card. Or you can use the default XPSP2 Microsoft drivers built in.The card seems has talked to all of my devices, but once they are shut off or in the case of the mouse, go to sleep, the card has a hard time re-connecting. This has been true for me with the Zoom Drivers(Toshiba BT Stack), MSXP2 Stack, or BlueSoleil Stack.The Logitech forum has several people reporting issues with the V270/Zoom card combination."
5,Great Product,Flawless. Installs itself in XP and Vista. Use it with a Bluetooth mouse and it works just great.
4,Good cubicle decor,It's exactly what is says it is... you either like The Office or you don't. I fall into the first category.
1,Yamaha HTR-5560 NO SUPPORT,"I agree with other reviewers that the Yamaha HTR-5560 sounds good for the money. The remote is a piece of junk and the overall unit is not the easiest to operate.But, the ABSOLUTE DO NOT BUY warnning is the total absence of support from Yamaha on their home audio products.Buy a keyboard, drum set or any band instrument and they're there for you. Home audio? Who? What?My receiver has suddenly started turning off in the middle of a DVD or CD. My guess is that it was something to do with heat but it also seems to be related to vibration (it will cut off at, say, the sound of a blast), but I'm not going to find any answers or even clues from Yamaha."
2,papermate is better,"these are not as fine pointed as similar pens by papermate, and they are globbier. they are cheaper but the papermate version aren't exactly expensive. i wouldn't buy them again. if you like fine point pens because of the sharper, drier feel, then these don't quite cut it. if you are splitting a box with someone who hates the hard feel of fine point but you don't like the muddy feel of medium point, then these are a good in-between."
2,Bought By Accident,"This CD came up on a general search of Blues CDs on Amazon. While I have a pretty wide view of what the blues is, this disc doesn't come anywhere close. Synth-Dance-Pop? YES!! Blues? NO! My kids listen to this style of music and to me it all ends up sounding the same. This disc is no exception. Probably could have made good filler music on some pop-teen summer movies over the 30 years. It won't be played too regularly in my cd player. An expert or afficinado in dance-pop might be able to tell you all the reasons that this is a great album in that genre... I can't do that though... Hopefully this will keep a blues fan from making the same mistake I did!"
3,The brother has wasted his talent,"Pharoahe Monche has plenty of skills, but his rhymes aren't kosher. His lyrical content is too negative (e.g. profanity, drugs, objectification of women, and even glorification of rape)! If you care about your mind, then don't listen to this garbage."
3,New Format?,"I love Garfield, and his newest book. I don't care for the format however. I have collected the other books for years and have them neatly on my shelf. This new format ruins the look I have going."
3,Bueno en general pero con sus detalles,Buen juguete pero: las piezas se caen costantemente. Las tarjetas no deberían de ser de cartón para que fueran mas duraderas.
5,Guess Who Marvel Edition,"A game that's pretty much what you'd expect. The game is incredibly fun for a group of people well-versed in the specifics of marvel characters' backgrounds. The game makes a great ""snack""; That is, a quick and fun game, one that doesn't linger too long or take too much energy. It's also a great way to realize just how nerdy you or your friends are. If you're looking for a filling experience or you're not well-versed in Marvel lore you'd probably be better off getting another game, such as the original Guess Who. But if you're a comic fan, or you know a comic fan, this is a game worth getting. The game is sturdy enough to be played with by adults, but the cardboard and plastic pieces probably won't last too long with kids."
4,Feels Like A Working Title Film.,"This story of a British family in meltdown mode in the weeks leading up to the daughter (Kate's) wedding, has all the ingredients to be slapped up on multiplexes everywhere with a witty attractive cast that could be culled from the likes of, 'Bridget Jones Diary' or 'Four Weddings & A Funeral'. Think Jim Broadbent as George, Imelda Staunton as Jean, and tack in Jude Law and or Emily Mortimer, and you get the idea. The strange thing with this book is that it started as this light, witty and charming confection of a novel and then suddenly began to veer off course into a totally unexpected territory beginning when George, the elderly protagonist, really began to lose his marbles. It didn't make me any less interested in the book,it just wasn't what I was expecting."
1,Waste of time,"Loved Curious Incident and have shared it with many friends. This effort, however, pales by comparison. I stayed with it thru to the end but was never able empathize with any of the characters. Don't waste your time on this, read his first book if you haven't yet, or wait for his next one."
2,A Spot of Tedium,"This book, as far as I am concerned, gets by on the coattails of 'A Curious Incident...'. It's really quite a tedious read and it left me feeling rather annoyed with myself for giving it so much benefit of the doubt. My advice? Don't bother with A Spot of Bother."
3,what are they talking about?,"I LOVE the audio book ""Curious Incident..."" so I am listening to this one. So far I only understand about 3/4 of what the characters are talking about. I know it's a different culture, but wow they have some odd phrases!!! Unfortunately, I do not like any of the characters; nor do I like the meandering plot. I still like the writer's stream of consciousness, so I will stick with it a while longer."
2,A spot of bother...don't bother....,"I bought the book for my teenage son, but wish I would have read chapter 44 before purchasing it. The book is now in the trash. The primary themes of the book adultery, homosexuality, and paranoia are not enduring for pre-teens especially. It was one of those books that had some good ideas and writing, but I found myself unconcerned about the ending because of the excessive junk you have to read through to get there."
3,Here's What 'Bothered' Me,"Strange story. Talk about your disfunctional family, this one could win a prize! While the characters are sometimes a touch too zany, they were somehow still compelling. I was alway interested, but not always satisfied with the progression of the characters. While the wife, daughter, and son eventualy learn from their mistakes and progress to a (somewhat) better place, the father degenerates into a slobbering jellyfish with few, if any, redeeming characteristics. Yes, it's worth the read, but as I said in the beginnning, very strange book."
4,Knockout,"Haddon's second novel is everybit as good as the first and I simply can't uderstand some of the reviewers slagging him off. What do they want? Don't they realise the time and effort and thought that goes into writing a novel? Don't they realise that the author delibrately does not want to deliver to the reader a like for like version and wants to move on. The dysfunctional family characterised in Haddons book are masterful I was particularly taken with George. Great stuff, a good rioutous read."
1,Errors all over the place,"This book is designed for an entry level person to the SQL language, so there should not be any errors.But that is not the case, errors all over the place, truly not a proffesional book I expected from Oracle press. Dont buy this book, because you dont want to get your foundation on SQL wrong just because some guy thought that is the right way to do things."
1,Not of much help.,The book does not contain much information.Include more information on Oracle 9i concepts and on ANSI/ISO join syntax for more than two table.
4,Good book to prepare you for the test,"Overall I thought this was a very good book. There were some typos, and an error or two on the sample test CD that was included, but many typos (errors in book questions) are corrected on the exampilot website ""exam guide fixes"" page.As someone with some SQL and Oracle experience I was able to pass the actual exam by just studying from this book, but there were a few questions on the exam that were not covered in this book so I recommend supplementing with a basic SQL book (I like ""The Practical SQL Handbook"" by Bowman, Emerson, Darnovsky), and a basic Oracle DBA book like ""The Oracle9i DBA Handbook"" by Loney and Theriault."
3,"Good study guide, but be careful of missing info and errors","This book is structured well for studying as it contains tips, two minute drills, and study questions both within a chapter and at the end of each chapter. The practice exams in the book and CD are good with only a few errors in them.Studying with this book will provide much of the information you need to pass the test, but it does not contain everything. Such as the use of any/all in single-row subqueries as one example. I did passed the test using this book alone (52/57), but I have a few years of SQL experience.While the CD's practice exams are good, I would avoid using the study sessions. There are some many errors in them as to be useless and misleading. I would also start studying with this book by first printing the Errata to make sure you have the latest corrections."
3,Good Starting Point,"This book is a good starting point. I used this book along with the Oracle documentation and passed the exam with 93%(53/57) on my first attempt. The important thing is that do not rely upon just this book to pass the exam. Like others wrote this book does not cover some of the new features like any, all etc and has many errors.Make use of the Oracle's ""Oracle9i SQL Reference"" free documentation in addition to this book. After going through the first 10 questions of the Practice Exam 1 in this book I decided to stop. I knew it is not worth my 2 hours. .... You can be hundred percent sure to pass the exam if you buy STS and prepare using it. But I felt I could have passed the exam even without buying STS. Gook luck."
2,Not enough to pass the exam with alone,"I've just taken the Oracle 9i SQL section of the DBA track, after having only read this book, and using Oracle 9i somewhat. I scored a 65% (passing was 70%). This book covered about 70% of the material that was on the test. In order to pass the test, you would need to have mastered every aspect of the book. Mind you, that would only get you a 70. You will need additional resources in order to score higher than that.I gave this book more than 1 star because, used in conjunction with other books, it is a useful resource. However, because of its lack of enough information to pass the exam, and also the clear laziness the editors showed when editing the book. There are several errors, some providing contradictary information. Others were minor typographical errors, but quite unprofessional.Overall, it is a useful book, but make sure this isn't the only book you buy."
5,Love this....,Great book. I am surely going to buy more books here. Its a fun way to learn.... hope they will have android app for my kindle....
2,Didn't work for me,"The powder didn't come out very well, so it was essentially useless for me. It was rather expensive for the quality."
2,Not as good as its brethren,I use several Claw slings but this one repeatedly slips off my shoulder. Its fore-end is too short and too tight to the fore-arm. Overpriced. Nah
4,Put this Book on your Mind,"Clarissa is not only a great poetress who marries melody and poetic rhythm she is the queen of imagery. I LOVE her book, her versatility and her spirit sings. One of my favoriite poems is ""Put me on."" Once you read it you'll understand the sutle strength of a true womanhood and why this book should play forever on your mind."
4,Cobra XRS R9G Intelilink Wireless Remote Radar/Laser Detector,"Radar Detector works great. It never worked for emergency vehicles which was a bomber. The remote battery life really sucks after a year or so, now i have to keep it plugged in at all times. I'll be looking to see if i find a replacement battery. The Detector also picks up red-light cameras works great however i had problems updating the GSP that comes with the device. Overall Great Product it's saved me from a couple tickets :)"
3,dangerous tornadoes,"this of tornadoes isnt like any other one because this book tells you what they can do to your home,you,your family, your valued things such as home, things handed down to you in the past. Another thing that this book talks about is how you can keep your family safe and you, tornadoes tells you where to go if your outside and not around a home. the main purpose of this book is tornadoes can and will kill you, and destroy everthing that you own. a good audience for this book is a person that is in to weather storms, likes to research on big diasters. i would recommend this book to you because you might learn how to save your family and yourself.CJ PICKETT"
1,Second one that died too quickly,I have had two of these unites die within two years of owning them . They used to last much longer. I would not recommend them to anyone.
5,Beautiful Tie,Great service. The tie was exactly as pictured. I will definately buy from them again.
4,"Good story, best toward the end","I enjoyed this movie the best toward the end when the couple begins to spend more quality time together. This may be a better rental than purchase. Then if you like it, you can buy it!"
4,"Faith, Family and Friends!!!","This was a nice movie to watch. A good story about faith, family and friends. The part I didn't agree with was about a female Christian not being able (or advised not to) re-unite with her non-believer husband because her of her current faith. The more enjoyable aspects of the movie are the deep love Jeff & Heather have, how important beliefs are, forgiveness, how to guide each other, and the strong positive friendships throughout. P.S. Three cheers for a wholesome movie without violence, nudity, foul language!!!"
5,Too True!,This play can really hit home if you have ever dated outside of your league. The pressure to date some one your friends approve of weighs heavy on the character Tom. Societal pressure to be perfect and be with the perfect person is explored and so worth your time and money to go on the journey. I completely recommend this play!
4,Great book! ;0) Thanks to Steve O'Hearne!,"I have bought the book ""Oracle - OCP Developer PL/SQL Program Units Exam Guide (Exam 1ZO-101). It's a great book. Only one defect! Using the CD of BeachFromQuizzer I account for an error : in all the subcategories except for 01 Overview of PL/SQL and 3 Practise Test the button EXPLAIN is not enable.In phase of Study session this button is useful and important...Sometimes the cd shows wrong answer too.That's all!"
2,Need thorough knowledge,"I took the test last week but failed with a score of 26.Looks like you need to prepare thoroughly and in depth to clear this test. I took by word the other reviews which claimed after studying this book,the test would a cakewalk. It doest seem so and the questions were more tricky and difficult. If you are planning to take ,prepare in depth and be prepared to expect tougher questions than in this book."
1,Rotten!,The only thing good about this product was the container - clever handle built into the screw down top. The product inside however was rotten. I threw the whole thing out! We purchase this same treat (different manufacturer) from local stores and they are great. The product I purchased here was dried up and covered with white stuff??? I should have pursued getting my money back...
3,Caution: not for toy breeds or puppies!,We discovered this after receiving it and reading the label. It should be in the item description here so consumers can make intelligent purchases!
2,This book is absolute trash,"Other than the bits about politics, this book was the wost trash I have read in ages! I couldnt stand the ""woman of cairo"" herself--simpering fool that she was. And the endless stream of disaters, what else could go wrong to these people? They deserved all they got except the happy ending for being so damn tiresome."
5,Author REALLY Knows His Historical Background,"I just reread this book, after reading it many years ago. In the intervening time, I spent several months in Egypt, and moved to Morocco, where I have resided for nine years. I couldn't put the book down, and read through it in about three days. What most impressed me this time was the author's comprehensive knowledge of the Middle-Eastern mentality, and his intimate portrayal of King Farouk, Nasser, and Sadat--the author having not only lived in Cairo, but having met personally these three historical figures. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Egypt, or who plans to travel to Egypt. My only other comment is that most Egyptian women would not be behaving as does the main female character in this novel, but they would think as she does."
2,Did not work for me,I cracked my Mazda Miata's plastic (who knew it was plastic?) radiator when I was disconnecting the top connector.The crack was small so I thought it worth trying this kit.It did not work out for me because the epoxy didn't stick to the radiator well enough. I prepared the surface as the instructions said - but I guess you really need to rough up he surface to get it to stick well.I ended up replacing the radiator - Amazon sells those too!
3,Buena Vista Social Club & Omara Portuondo,"One's view of this CD may depend on what the ""Buena Vista Social Club Presents"" conjures up. Does this mean a particular type of style, ensemble, musicians, production values, or something else, such as a marketing ploy to sell as many records as possible? Omara Portuondo's singing is beautiful, powerful, and emotional. The production is wonderful. Yet, in my case, I would have been happy to use Napster or Gnutella to download only a few of the songs. A number of the songs, including the first, use a string orchestra, others a string quartet, one a rather hokey electric guitar. Others may disagree, though, and love the album for its presentation of diverse styles, all beautifully performed. I suggest borrowing it from a friend and checking it out first."
4,I like it!,"As all the other reviews says. This is a good album. I have got a few of Steven's CDs and this gave me a few more songs to add to my list of favorites.The CD is easy to listen to, but still has got a lot to say. While listening I'm often reminded about who God really is. It was mentioned before, but I still wan't to point out the song 'no greater love'. 'God is God' is another song I like, and also the song 'carry you to Jesus'.If you like the other albums by SCC, you won't be disappointed with this one. Haven't heard SCC before, listen to the samples and see what you think!"
5,Amazing,"This album is amazing. Each time I play it, I get a new feeling, I get touched by the songs in a new ways. This album is all about our love for God and God's love for us. Just as the title suggests, it's about the declaration of our love and need for God. ""Live it Out"", ""Magnificient obession"", ""declaration of dependence"", ""No Greater Love"" reinforces the theme over and over again. Yet all the songs have a different beat,a different rythmn, a different mix of brokeness, excitement and need so you'll never get tired of listening to them over and over again. I was awe-strucked by ""God is God"". The message is so clear; we are all just human with limited vision so we can never understand everything. That's why we are in constant need for God and in constant amazement of the wonderful things that HE is capable of.I really liked ""Signs of Life"" and ""Speechless"" too but Steven Curtis Chapman is now even better with this album!"
3,Good for the Beginning Beginner,"This book was mildly intertaining, but focused a bit more than I'd like on numerology and ""games"" rather than the cards... It gave several good beginning spreads, but seemed to lean toward entertainment value more than education, or mysticism. A good book for the youngest Tarot beginners, though, as it kept things on a very light level."
3,Spooky,"I have always been attracted to stories about evil living dolls. This book, isn't really scary, you've seen the plot probably twenty different times on tv, but it still makes a good read.When Cassie finds Ara she thinks the doll will be the perfect friend to combat her lonliness upon moving. Soon Ara, takes on a life of her own and begins to threaten Cassie. Cassie gets weak and sick, causing her parents and teacher to worry about her, but they are unable to help her because they don't believe in a doll coming to life...."
2,A little stiff,"I think they are too stiff for comfort. I do like the short finger, but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff. I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit. But it hasn't. Protects the hands well through off road trails though."
5,I like this one quite a bit,"It has a very unique attitude to it that I like alot. It rhythmic but a little abstract, even still. There is also alot of nice bass. It's tough to judge a matter of taste objectively, so all I can really say is that I think it's a must-have."
5,Momo Tuner - looks and feels great,"I installed this on my 1987 Porsche Carrera because the original steering wheel is kind of large and the diameter of the grip is too thin. This Momo wheel is just right. It is the diameter of modern steering wheels and your fingers grip it comfortably without having to try to grip it -- it just fits. With no power steering, it takes some effort to steer an old Carrera at slow speeds, but the grippy leather and perfect rim size of this wheel make it tolerable. On a twisty road with some speed on, it is perfect. It looks nice too."
2,Disappointed,"Ordered it for a baby shower and it came dirty. Obviously I returned it and ended up just giving a gift card which was disappointing for me. However, Amazon was awesome helping me return it - sending a label and within two weeks my account was credited the charge. That was great. Was a fluke probably. These bobby pillows are wonderful - would have been a perfect gift."
3,Correct Name of Polish-Color Not What I'd Hoped Aor,I received this Opi color. The name of the color was correct but the polish wasn't the color that I thought it would be. The seller was very kind and sent me a return envelope with postage paid and credited my charge card. The customer service was excellent!
2,"Good, but still disappointing...","This CD is good, for what it is, but it just doesn't seem like Michelle to me. I loved Listen and Center of My Universe, but this one just sounds like its trying to sell more than appeal to her regular fans. There is so much other music like this out there, Michelle's was unique in the Christian genre...now it isn't...perhaps I'll get used to it...I got used to the change that the Corrs made, and the one that Sara Evans did too, but for awhile, it will be disappointing."
3,Michelle Tumes - Dream,"Ditto the Amazon review. Michelle was really creating some beautiful sounds with her first 2 CD's. Very surreal and unique. There is plenty of pop music without Michelle getting into it. I for one hope she ventures back into the style of her first 2 releases. Plenty of artists can sing pop, very few have the talent to produce material like her earlier work."
3,There's no place like home...,"Cliché-ridden and filled with stock characters, this novel somehow still manages to be likeable.Set against the exotic locale of a Caribbean cruise, ""Dreamboat"" successfully mimics the Wizard of Oz mantra, ""There's no place like home,"" as it follows the seafaring intrigues of Cassidy Cooper, who must leave home before she can truly appreciate the simplicity of her small town roots.Toss in Cassidy's longtime archrival Josh Cortez, mysterious British bad boy Marcus O'Roark, and her lonely widower father, and you've got a recipe for ""romance on the high seas"" (to quote the back cover of the book). While Dreamboat doesn't really make any particularly profound commentary on the human condition, it's entertaining, upbeat, and worth the time it takes to read it."
4,CoOL BOok,"It is shocking to find out who the culprit is, you think you know then the end comes. I read this book in 1 hour, definately holds your attention."
4,Natasha's Review,"I liked the book because it had a surprise ending. It was kind of boring at the beginning but once something bad happened it started to get interesting.The book Stepsister was about a high school girl named Emily, her sister Nancy, and her stepsister named Jessie. One day when Jessie was taking a nice calm bath, Emily starts to read Jessie's diary. The entry she read was something that she thought that Jessie did was true. The whole time Jessie was living with them some bad things happened, for example, when Emily got home from a dance she found her dog dead. Then the next day she finds her dogs dead body in her backpack. But at the end something happens that you wouldn't expect.I think this book will be good for anyone older than 10 because little kids they would probably think it was scary. Another reason is that there are words that little kids wouldn't understand."
4,Meagan's Review,"Yes I did like this book because I have read other R L Stine books, but they where Goosebumps books and have really liked them because I really like mystery books.The book is about Emily and her family. Her mom tells her that she is going to be getting two new stepsisters. One is called Jessie and the other is called Nancy. Once they are at her house strange things start happening. Somebody killed Tiger, Emily's dog, while she was at a dance. Somebody killed Jollie and somebody put peroxide in Emily's favorite shampoo. When the family goes camping and Emily, Jessie and Nancy go looking for firewood, Nancy gets separated and Emily tries to get away from Jessie and she ends up in the old grave yard. When Nancy puts the shovel in the rabbit's grave the shovel lands on Emily's arm and her arm is broken. Why has someone been trying to hurt Emily?I recommend this book to anyone."
3,Alright,"This is album is ok,I love the title,but it is missing some of the bass queens original funk ,dontcha think?...It's very loud and bassy,and I cant say I enjoy every single song on this album."
2,Doesn't work with the new 4 & 8GB Nano Ipods,The unit does not come with an adapter to fit the new 4 or 8 GB nano ipods. There are a bunch of adapters supplied that allow the many older ipod styles to fit the unit. I called JBL tech support and parts and both indicated that it indeed did not support these new ipods. One agent indicated that he thought that the product may be at 'end of life' and that they probably would not supply the adapters. So if you plan to use the unit with current generation iPods you might consider something else.Otherwise it sounds great. The controls are 'ok' but take some getting used to.
4,One of the few things my son will give attention to,"I got several of the suction toys and this is the only one my son will give some attention to. He honestly enjoys pulling it up and ""unsucking"" it and chews on the metal and then throws it. It has taken many spills and still looks like new. He's eight months now so lets see if he actually wants to play with it some day. This has the hardest sucking cups of all the toys but my boy is really strong and has been ""unsucking"" it from five months old."
3,Good starting point,This book has good ideas and helpful hints for all sizes of rooms and or Ideas you may want to add to any space.
3,Sarcasm not good with young kids,The book was OK but it was written in a sarcastic way which may not always get through to younger kids (age 5 in my case).
5,Javajoe (Connecticut),"I purchased Stephen Bigalow's book, ""Profitable Candlestick Trading"", some eight months ago, and found it extremely valuable. The most important point I learned is that candlesticks are nothing to be feared. Stephen cuts through all the mystery and rhetoric surrounding candlesticks with clear, down-to-earth, factual explanations. He further lays out candlestick trading rules to establish a workable trading program. You won't find a better educational investment."
5,My Review,"This a great book. You can tell that he is an experienced trader and not some ghost writer fidgeting for words trying to explain something that he is not entirely familiar with. I have never heard anyone blast the analysts on Wall St. like him. He was not unkind, just truthful. I have been using Candlesticks for about 3 years, but not with the full conviction it takes to be really successful. This book has turned the tide for me. I hope he writes another book to give more of his insights on trading. I will buy it."
4,Bach: cantatas,"Bach's orchestral compositions are my absolute favorite music but I thought I'd try some of his cantatas for a change. They're pretty darn good, too."
1,SPORTS player?,"Hmmm.....I'm thinking the name ""rugged sports player"" was a misnomer....I'm sure this player would be more than adequate for someone who's bedridden, but try to jog with it and you'll soon find out it's NOT very activity acclimated AT ALL......"
3,For Taylor fans or avant-garde enthusiasts,"I'm a fan of Taylor's frantic style, but I think it's important to rate items based on what people who aren't aware of the artist might perceive of the work if they had to buy it, so for fans of his or Ornette Coleman's work, I say ""5 stars"", but understand this: most people who are into smooth jazz or even most traditional jazz would be completely turned off by this record. Taylor is a jazz-head's musician.It's a powerful record, full of his trademark speed, delightful playfulness, and technical virtuosity, but there are more accesible records of his. Pay close attention the albums that will be re-released...there's some gems in there.For existing fans only or avant garde heads. To everyone else, it will sound like someone pounding on a piano. You've been warned."
4,Good book for Oracle and Unix starter,"Hi,I will recommend this book for every Oracle and UNIX starter. Book is more on using and managing Oracle easily and efficiently on UNIX server. If you just looking for UNIX administration book than this might not be the book you looking for.All in one book will be really useful for newbie to intermediate level of DBA using UNIX server.Regards,Nirmal"
4,Great Mount,"Mount works great and for having a 100+ pound tv on it moves relatively easy. I would buy one again. My 2 gribes about the mount are:1. Plastic cord hides on the arms are flimsy2. When retracted all the way back (flat) against the wall the unit sticks out from the wall further than I would prefer leaving the tv roughly 6-8"" from the wall."
5,good,"I need to now how to program my system,I would like to now how to.Butover all the system is the best."
3,Not enough episodes...,I got this for my teenage sister. Wizards of Waverly Place is her favorite show and Selena Gomez is her idol. The thing I don't like is that you only get four episodes. It'd be better if Disney released full seasons of their shows rather than banking on $15 for just four episodes. They finally released Hannah Montana full seasons after releasing many 4 episode discs over the past couple years.
2,Like shooting fish in a barrel!,"I don't consider myself a ""gifted"" reader, but I got through this book in about 7 minutes! I'm not kidding, it was that easy! I don't really understand what was happening with the plot, but it all seemed believeable. Except the part about flying. I don't think that is true. Also, I think that telling kids that ""It's the same big world for all of us"" is kind of cruel. Obviously some folks get a better chance than others at succeeding, but I'm not bitter. Anyway, I loved the pictures. I would recommend this book for anyone who needs to add another title to their life list."
4,Good work shoes,"I bought these shoes specifically for working in. I'm a landscaper and i also cut lawns. That means i walk a lot and need a very comfortable shoe to walk 5+ miles per day in. I've been using these shoes for about a month now with no problems other than some discomfort near my little toes on either feet. This is because the shoe does stretch very much and your foot rubs against the inner material.As far as wear, the shoes look brand new for the most part. The sole is very non-slip and the laces dont come undone.I hope my review was helpful"
1,NOT A REAL BIOGRAPHY,"The author writes that he could not obtain help from direct family of the writer or the autorization to consult files. What you read is a ligth, very light, story of the writer. NOT A BIOGRAPHY!"
3,Needs improvements in design and manufacturing,"This is a fun toy. Nonetheless, I gave the toy only a C (three stars). First, the design of the bridge needs improvements: the ramps slop down from the bridge too steeply; small cars, such as Hot Wheels, can't move from the bridge onto the ramps and back without scraping the bridge-ramp connection with their bellies. Second, manufacturing needs lots of attention. The spacing of holes in the footings does not match the spacing of the holes in the straight road ramps. I had to enlarge the holes in the ramps with scissors. Third, in the building guide the bridge shown in steps 1-3 differs from the one in step 4-6 (page 9), while they should be the same. How difficult is it to make sure that your assembly instructions are clear and precise? Had the designers and manufacturers paid just a bit more attention to detail, this would've been a great toy."
4,Much more than a tell-all,"Once I began this extraordinary book, I could not put it down. Whether you are an art buff, addicted to ebay or simply relish a great story, you can't go wrong. Not often a fan of non fiction, I'm inspired to seek out other works.If the book is lacking anything, it's that I wish it had been longer. Highly recommend."
1,Getting Famous on Innocent Victems,This book uses names and places of innocent victems without permission. What this author has done is no better than what he claims the Deerings had done. Shamefull how he used these people's devastation to make a story he can publish.
1,review about dishonest bookseller,"I oredered this book and,in accordance with the Info on there site,itsuppose to come with CD in it.When I received the book,CD was missing and seller began playing dirty tricks with me by saying that they've mentioned on there siteabout missing CD.I copied and sent them their own ad that said: ""Book and CD""To make the story short,they never sent me CD and I keep this uselessbook as a reminder about the CROOKS!Guys,BE AWARE of this seller!!!"
3,Wireless reference and guide,"The world of Wireless technology is new and constantly evolving to meet the security and real world threats to this infrastructure. Published by Cisco Press, 802.11 Wireless LAN Fundamentals, ISBN 1587050773, by Pejman Roshan and Jonathan Leary, explains the basis of the Ethernet technologies and how it relates to the 802.11x topology.If you are new to Wireless, this is not the book for you! On the other hand, if you have a firm understanding of the basics of the communication, then this book serves as good reference and guide. The organization of the book is somewhat difficult to follow, but the technical diagrams and charts are very detailed and concise."
2,too small for toddlers,"A complete and detailed reproduction of an excavator, yes BUT not what my 3 yr old had in mind. This is hard metal with sharp corners and much smaller than we anticipated. Our boy preferred the tonka lg plastic excavator which was much bigger and cheaper.Far from a sandbox toy, this one is for the serious construction truck collector."
1,Another bad performance by Parrott,"This is a poorly done version of Modtverdi's Verpers, by someone who has little understanding of the music of the period. Phrasings are long to the extent that structure of these great pieces are over stretched. I long for a performance better than Mr. Parrott's."
4,Awesome powerhouse of light,"I own the Surefire M6 Guardian and the Streamlight Ultra-stinger. The M6, with its standard bulb rates at 250 lumens and the Ultra-Stinger rates at 295 lumens. Bottom line, the M6 is considerably brighter against the fully charged Ultra-Stinger and the new battery M6. The way Surefire considers lumens gives a truer point of reference. The M6 also offers heavy duty service and defensive capabilities, smaller package, sturdier package and the option of 500 powerful lumens that would blow Streamlight's same lumens away. Much more money, much more light."
3,somewhat disappointing,"Monica Huggett is certainly a highly accomplished violinist, however, her and the Raglan Baroque Players vision of Vivaldi's op.8 concertos is just not to my taste. Theirs is a legitimately bouyant, lighthearted approach to this uplifting music, yet the treatment seems to be so bouyant as to be almost weightless. One of the primary culprits here? The tempi, which are invariably too fast.It almost goes without saying that the Raglan Baroque Players are technically flawless (almost to a fault, as they seem to play too effortlessly, if such a thing can be imagined), but their approach simply does not fully communicate the spirit of Vivaldi."
4,I Fear Photoshop!,"If your afraid to try Photoshop or you think you might not use all of what Photoshop has to offer, buy this book, download Gimp and learn how to edit, manipulate, etc. your images. This book is easy to understand, although a little out dated due to the nature of software maturity, but still helpful nonetheless."
5,You will love this book!!,"This is one of those rare books that you'll race to finish and be sorry when you're done. There were so many positive aspects to this story: the well-drawn and sympathetic characters, the amusing secondary characters (particularly the witches - I'd love to see more of their meddling!), the appealing setting and the excellent writing. This was my first book by Christina Skye and I plan to read her others right away! I bought this book on the basis of other reader recommendations and they didn't steer me wrong! Enjoy!"
5,A Beautiful Apple,"This is a lovely oil painting, much more impressive than the picture here shows. Originally I thought a 10 X 10 canvas would be small but this picture is of a beautiful, huge apple, and the depth of the frame makes it really stand out. The quality of the brush strokes and the color is excellent, as was Malovani's service. I'm a very impressed and satisfied customer."
3,Not worth it,"this book is purly just something to read out of curiosity. The book has some good history, but there is so much ignorance within recent history portion that this book is laughable...You prabably know more without the book. Check it out of the library don't buy it."
5,Oahu surprised us,"We've been to other islands with this series and on the spur of the moment took a week off to try one that was new. One word for Oahu: exciting. There was diversity there like nightlife, shopping, great restaurants, history and drop dead beauty. We didn't realize this until we opened the pages of this book right before leaving. On the way over we planned our itinerary and everyday brought something more amazing than the next.For starters, the hikes. We took six of them and discovered beautiful waterfalls and pools and lush green forests. These books really excel when it comes to directions to spots not many other tourists know about.I recommend this guidebook. Oahu was a great destination."
1,Seems like an Oahu Diary to Write-Off Oahu Vacation,"Neither me nor my wife found this bood useful at all. No maps in the book to help you find anything. To find anything, they basically give you these obscure directions like you're on a treasure chest hunt: go down to the 6th palm tree on the left down the road then when you see goat grazing near a fire hydrant then look to your right and take that road about 300 ft and there you'll run into the old lay with the pirate patch. Ask her where.... Seemed like the people who wrote this book were simply trying to find any easy way to tax write-off their travels in Oahu. Lame book. Don't buy!"
1,Is this for real? I just don't understand the appeal.,"I got pointed to this song when I signed on one day, and I thought it was a joke. Since I wasn't quite sure, I clicked on a link to find a sample of the song, and a description of the ""artist"", if I can even call her that. The song isn't a joke! I couldn't believe it! I can't imagine that this song was written for any other purpose except to advertise AIM. In fact, her entire website (it's like a car wreck, you just can't keep your eyes away) is one big marketing plot for it. An advertising jingle? Fine. But a song? A song people can actually *buy*? A song this girl is going on tour for? Where do people see the merit in it?"
5,Breathtaking,"This is possibly the most horrendous recording released in the last 50 years. Not since ""Yummy Yummy Yummy, I've got Love in my Tummy"" has a song been so completely devoid of any content. This is the height of stupid commercial songwriting and should be experienced by every man woman and child in the country. Not nearly a pothole, but a gaping sinkhole in the highway of American culture. Purchase and enjoy."
5,Local favorite,My wife and I were on a trip to Montego Bay a few years back when I asked one of the local guys to give me a tip on the current hot reggae. He pointed me to Capelton and Buju Banton. I went to a downtown mo-bay CD store and selected a few cds including More Fire and headed back to the hotel. Later in the day I asked the DJ to put More Fire on to see what it was like and the place exploded with the locals all dancing and grooving to these tracks. It was an instant hit for me listening and watching the groovin that was occuring. It is hard core but positive. I now own all of his CDs and eagerly await his next release or a chance to see him live!
3,A modern book worth reading.,"When my old writing mentor asks me what I am reading and I tell him I am reading either Jay McInerney or one of the novelists from the lost generation. I recently told him I was reading Jonathan Tropper. This book has a great plot and and is an enjoyable read. There are funny moments but it is not parallelled by authors such as McInerney or Flannery O' Connor. The ending is too wrapped up. Maybe I am a minimalist but I feel after reading this book that I was given the Scooby-doo scenario. You will enjoy reading this book, but I warn this is not for the people who enjoy the minimalist flow or those who are fans of the weathered humorist. It has it's funny moments but the ending is forced. This seems like the type of book that should have been written in screenplay format first if you know what I mean. (This book will no doubt spawn a film version.)"
3,Like watching TV,"A ""Big Chill"" on paper, an episode of Thirtysomethingyou can hold in your hands. If that's your cup of tea, here youare. But Mink felt it was a little uninspired."
2,Plan B,The first quarter of the book was difficult to get through. Just boring. It was simplistic and the end was predictable. It was poorly edited too. It was a five minute read. It was very obvious that this was his first book as later works of his are so much better.
4,BEAUTIFUL GLASSES,The glasses are beautiful but 2 arrived broken. The company has shipped replacements but I have yet to receive them.
3,a little complicated,"This book seems written more for people with experience in Probability and Statistics. The examples in the chapters were not explained very well for a novice. The text itself was helpful. This would be good as a side reference in a class, or it might benefit someone with more experience in the topic."
1,Very bad voice overs,"The movie itself is 3 and a half stars(out of five). However, this is a foreign film and the dubbing(English voice overs) are awful. They are totally out of sync with the actors' mouths and there is no subtitles available on this DVD. It is too bad because this is a pretty good Christmas flick with some good atmosphere."
5,Great Adult Santa Claus Movie,Best Santa Claus Movie i've ever seen especialyl for Adults.. Iv'e never seen one better.I bought 4 copies for my adult children
1,Christmas Story Video,"I watched this movie at a foreign film festival. It was subtitled and brought many of the audience to tears - it was so good. I was really disappointed to find the three copies I ordered from the USA were dubbed over with cheesy American accents and this ruined the film. I may have missed this fact when ordering but if not, if this information could be provided prior to purchase it would be beneficial. That issue aside, it is the second time I have used Amazon and the service, updates and delivery have been outstanding.Many thanksFelicity Arnott ( Thailand)"
2,No instructions or documentation of any kind included.,"I'm not an electrician. I just want to hook up my 200W Sony stereo receiver to my office's speaker system. There are about a dozen speakers installed in different rooms. Each speaker has its own in-wall volume control with a small transformer attached to it.There are only 4 wires that come out of the wall, available to hook up with my receiver/amplifier. Evereything worked fine until last month, when burglars broke in and stole my receiver and some electronic gizmo that looks like the picture of this product. I have managed to figure out that it used as a 70-volt system, with down-converting transformers at each speaker. I tried hooking up this transformer between the speaker outputs of the amplifier and the 4 wires that come out of the wayy, but it doesn't work. I have tried every variation that I can think of. Since there isn't any documentation or instructioons with this product, I don't know what to try next! HELP!"
2,Gather Harmony Lacking,"I was seriously disappointed with the CD. I am a major fan of the BillGaither Homecoming series of CDs and DVDs; I especially love the harmonies of the singing, the soul-lifting full chorus harmonies and the heavenly vocal blends of the smaller groups in the Gaither entourage. Unfortunately, little of that is evident on this CD. I enjoyed Mark Lowry's rendition of ""Mary, Did You Know?"", one of the selections that drew me to this recording, but I found little else to like here. There's even some spoken recitation, which I find distacting. I can't recommend this CD."
2,It is not tolerated by my dogs,My pups liked eating it. But it did not seem to digest in their GI system. They may have been old. I do not know. My pups have had this from other co's and not had a problem.
1,Must be YUCK,"I have 3 dogs, all different breeds who will eat anything including the cat if we let them and not one of them will eat these.."
3,CLUNK!,"Drives me crazy every time the lid closes on this thing! CLUNK! Not a soft clunk, but a loud metal sounding clunk! I've read other reviews saying it is quiet so maybe I got a defective one, but beware. Also, like many stainless steel products it shows all the fingerprints. It is nice looking for a garbage can and fits in fine with the other decor in my kitchen. Easy to put in and take out trash bag. Overall, I'm happy with it, just don't like the clunk!"
3,Nice looking but.....,"Although it is very nice looking it has some faults.First and mostly, it is hard to take out the inner container. You have to get your fingers between the inner and outer unit and pull it out. There is not much space between them and sometimes it gets stuck from side to side on top sliding the inner container out.The ring around the unit that hides your garabge bag , you can pinch your fingers in! Plus it does not seem to lock in place all the time. You have to make sure it snaps in place.Lastly it does not stay open unless you have your foot on it to stay open."
5,Gerbils by Engelbert Kotter,We purchased the book Gerbils (Baron's Complete Pet Owner's Manuals) by Englebert Kotter. The book is a great addition to library pet cared section. Thank you
5,The Expected One,"I am a professional writer, and a big fan of Mark Rogers' work. I can't say enough about the quality of the writing in this book. It is a crime that it, indeed all his works, are not better known. If you like to read, period, pick up this novel."
1,Disappointed in Bell and Howell but very pleased with Amazon,"I have used a Bell and Howell lamp just like this one for over 4 years and never had to change the bulb. i purchased one for my son and while the price was right, the delivery was prompt the lamp did not work. Even changed the bulb with no result. Fortunately Amazon has an excellent return policy. I love Amazon."
2,great light shoddy workmanship,like many of the other viewers my lamp stopped working. I purchased a new bulb but this did not work. I love the light the lamp gives but not sure if I want to invest another $60.00 for a new one. I will research and see if another company makes possibly a better manufactured one.
5,Excellent,"I highly recommend the Bell & Howell Sunlight Lamp. Not only does it provide better quality lighting, it is much more economical to use. I love the lamp's features...I have three of them."
1,Solid book but.......,"This is a really good book for someone who is invloved in the subject, otherwise it is a readers nightmare, I lost count on the times the author writes "" but not have been fully understood""...all he does in Ch4 and Ch5 is tell you what someone designed and what they achieved, it is like he copied and pasted technical journal papers into this book, I would not advice anyone on buying it, hard work have been put in it, but it is still a BAD book.....consider LEDs by schubert....."
4,Very beautiful bracelet,"The bracelet is beautiful and appropriate for dress or casual. However, it is difficult to clasp. I would still purchase again because it is so attractive and comfortable."
4,HELP PLEASE,"Does anyone know the name of the band and/or the song that is played in the TV commercial/preview for ""Serendipity?"" I know it's not David Gray's ""Babylon."" That one comes out in the trailer. But there's this other song that they play with the preview they show on TV...anybody know? Thanks!"
4,where is the rest of the score???,"a movie filled with great music - only not all of it on the cd - still, glad I bought it...."
2,Anna Espinosa is a love-sick crazy woman,"I've only read one other book in the series, Recruited, which I thought was pretty good. I was looking forward to learning more about Sydney and Anna Espinosa's relationship and how it began. I was sorely disappointed by Anna's lack of depth. I couldn't believe that she was being portrayed as a jealous psychopath, end of story. A psychopath she may be, but I would have appreciated a bit more in depth writing about her. I simply don't buy that Sydney and Anna have this incredible rivalry simply because Anna believes Syd ""stole"" her boyfriend!It makes me sad, and angry that someone who wrote for the TV show could portray any one of its characters so shallowly. Even if Anna is the bad guy (girl) she should still have a strong personality. Just my two cents."
1,Unfortunate,"I was really looking forward to protecting my screens so when I got the guards I immediately wanted to put them on my phone. Unfortunately they come with a sticker on the front that leaves way too much residue. I tried to rub out the residue with warm water and a towel, it just got worse. I tried to use nail polish remover (carefully) to take the residue off and it still wouldn't come off! After this whole process the screen was full of my fingerprints and residue all over! I had to throw them out because there was just no way of getting them clean!"
3,2 Piece (Outer and Inner LCD) Scratch Resistant Screen Guard Protector...,the 2 piece outer and inner LCD scratch resistant screen guard protector was okay. Had to be installed with care or air bubbles underneath.
4,DenverArtist's Wonderful Phone Review's,I like this product and I recommend it to everyone with a Motorola Razr! Its easy to put this product on the Razr and it is Scratch Resistant!
4,Not a necessary accessory...but,"I purchased this as part of a package, so it only ended up costing about 1-2 dollars. It definitely works...wouldn't say everyone needs it, but it definitely was worth it for the price."
4,Anotehr good listen from Payton,"I love the beginnings of Payton's CDS. Payton's Place's first track kicks off with that great drum beat and gets the music going with grove that just makes you dance. Gumbo Nouveau kicks off in a similar way with Whoopin' Blues letting you know the theme is New Orleans. This offering starts with some harpsicord that gets the listener ready for some jazz in the same way. The rest of the album did not seem to captivate me as much as the previously mentioned offerings did, However. It is still a wonderful CD and I am very glad to play it in regular rotation."
3,Good effort but not all that,"This is a good cd with a lot of strong points. Pick up the first one, ""Taste Like Sugar"" and you'll get the real deal. The vocals on ""Taste Like Sugar"" are more raw and more Sugarbomb in a live setting. Not so sugary sweet like ""Bully"".Also, Sugarbomb has been dropped from RCA so hold on to those CD's they're one of kind!"
3,Incomplete,"When you see the words 'The Best of,' usually thoughts of split tv episodes (how do they decide 'the best' anyway) and selected comic strips from some funny papers comes to mind. It is the same here.This is the one volume collection of the three volume RBG pokemon manga. It contains all three volumes minus most of the Team Rocket plotline. The only TR story it has is the Mew story with Green (Blue for you Japanophiles). Still a decent book, but definitely not the best. If you can find them, go for the individual volumes. The upcoming Yellow collection will most likely be the same. Hopefully, this is just a precursor to Viz releasing the Gold/Silver series on up in the near future."
4,Oregon blade grinder,"Grinder works great for sharpening mower blades. Only problem I had was that the inner wing nut and washer on grinding platform wouldn't fit. When I contacted Oregon about it they stated ""it wasn't necessary to install it"" instead of admitting that there was a problem with either their build specs or their manufacturing process in China."
2,eh.,"modest mouse is a great band but this is not the place to start if you are unfamiliar with them. it's an assortment of somewhat bland songs that left me wanting more and better. i would recommend 'the moon and antartica' or 'this is a long drive..' first, and if you find that you absolutely must have everything modest mouse, purchase this one as well."
4,Wonderful Music...,"I am quite surprised that several of these tracks didn't make it on to MandA, namely Night on the Sun, So much Beauty in Dirt, and Here it Comes. The purchase price is at least worth these three songs, all of which compare to some of the best from any of their earlier works.However, I must admit that this album tends to go the same route as MandA, which to me is unfortunate. The polish and sparkle on MandA is beautiful and haunting, but doesn't have the raw energy present on Long Drive or Lonesome Crowded West.All in all, as a huge fan of the band over the years, I am quite satisfied with their latest work (though perhaps not as much as when I first heard LCW or Long Drive)."
4,Night on the Sun shortened,"It is important to note that this version of night on the sun is shorten by 2 mins, from the original 12"". The only way to get the complete version on cd is the Japanese import."
1,Brake Pads bad,"The model that I needed had spring clips to pull the pads away from the rotor. Two of the clips easily fell off during installation. I am glad that they fell off before I had them installed. I was a bit surprised because I had regarded Raybestos as a top brand, which I no longer do. I had to stop my installation and go buy another set of brake pads (NOT Raybestos).On a good note, Amazon sent me a return shipping label and refunded my money. I love Amazon."
1,Not Great,"If you want a PG13 SIM then this game is for you.Sim games that were made 5 years ago were better than this. Graphics were OK, but game play got old real fast."
3,Misleading System Requirements,"Do Not Be Mislead By The System Requirements Needed By This Game, You Need The Following To Play It:CPU - 1Ghz Or BetterMemory - 256Mb Or More3D Video Card - 32MB Or More MemoryDirectX - Version 9.0b"
2,Sticky lid,"Trash can was sturdy and the capacity was good. However, when opening and closing the can the lid would stick. No amount of adjusting would correct the problem."
4,"Interesting and believable, I couldn't put it down!!!",I learned much about the history of Saratoga County as well as it's haunts in this book of true short stories and accounts of local hauntings. The accounts are even more interesting because I know where most of these places are and have heard similar stories. It's nice to have a book to back me up when I repeat them to unbelieving fiends. David Pitkin did a great job!!!
2,Potential for sliding off,"A person in a weakened condition, e.g. bedridden, can easily slide off the wheelchair seat. Suggest placing rug gripper between wheelchair seat and cushion."
1,Very disappointing,"This was a big disappointment. The fabric is very flimsy. Worse, the foam has an awful chemical smell. After a few minutes in the house, the smell was so bad I had to take it outside. Several days later, it still stinks.For comparison, we also have one of the Drive branded cushions. It costs more, but is well worth it. So this one goes back and I'll order the Drive cushion."
2,Measure your chair before ordering?,"I have a 16"" sports wheelchair. I assumed this would work. Wrong. The seat is slung between the back tires, which cantilever a bit, to give better stability on the basketball court. Place a 4""x16""x18"" cushion on my wheelchair seat and you sit too high. The cushion impedes the movement of those tires. tried it on my office chair as well. It's too high and hard to keep in the seat. Regreattably, I will return this item. It might be great for a heavier person with a standard size wheelchair. It just doesn't work for me."
5,"Nice, thick, supportive","This is just like the one I had in hospital: thick, supportive, useful. It perhaps has me too high in the wheelchair, but I expect it will wear down over time. I thought it was a nice addition to getting the chair as I can vary my support level."
1,I got it for my scooter.,"It was too big and I returned it. I could not use it on my scooter, so I returned it."
5,a great book out of a great series - a review by Eli (age 7),This book is really out of this world. I have been hooked on the magic school bus series. I can't wait to read more books in the series. The inside the human body book is full with very interesting facts and I learned so much from reading it. Arnold doesn't know where the bus is and is trying to find it. He doesn't even know that it is actually inside him. Then Arnold sneezes and finds the bus right next to him. He doesn't understand how he didn't see it before.
4,'Darkly Romantic' poetry-,"I was fortunate enough to read a copy of ""Illumination Without Light"" from Revolution Press - and what the descriptions won't tell you, is that there are a few illustrations for the poems. And even though the illustrations are in black-and-white, you can tell that they are hand-drawn by skilled artists. (The illustration for ""Once Upon a Time"", the final poem in the book, is lovely - a young man and his love as if at a wedding, with the formal tux and dress, but with wings - a neat blend of fantasy and symbolic elements in with a common scene.)I'd consider the poetry ""darkly romantic"". Fans of Edgar Allan Poe would definitely like the way Mr Aaron treats his subjects. There are no cute rhymes in these poems, but it does make for a captivating read."
3,4 star protien bar,"I wanted some cheap and tasty protein bars I could keep at work. These were perfect. For the price you can't complain, and they have a great taste and texture. The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5, is that they have High Fructose Corn Syrup. I am not a fan of that, I ended up just ordering all natural Clif Bars from Amazon to replace these at work once I ate all the Myoplex."
1,WISHING,"Again, wish I could review this product, but unfortunately, even trying compatible mode on my computer, it won't load. Oh well."
1,Cotton Candy,"After having read Tyrell's ""Boy Clinton"" I was really looking forward to a good read. I am sorry to say that this book is fluff and certainly not worth the price."
2,A Waste of Money!,"This is simply the sheet music to Soup ... it's not worth the money unless you can't find it in regular music stores. It's alright if you just WANTED sheet music, but don't expect to find anything special about the band."
3,JAPANESE EDGAR WALLACE---PAM GRIER MOVIE,"A nutty 1970s Japanese movie that comes across akin to those 1960s German Edgar Wallace nutty movies, but this movie is faster and better. The Japanese anti-hero of this movie goes through as much abuse as any pam Grier character, though she doesn't have her chest.;)Lots of action, mood, some sick incest sex scenes, neon signs of sleazy Japanese red light districts, and even a poetic THE THIRD MAN sewer.There's a forced abortion scene that might offend a lot of viewers. If released today, this movie would be rated nc-17 for its unrelenting luridness.A lot better, and of course more origonal than any KILL BILL movie, it's short on common sense, but there are some dream-like scenes that make it more than the typical action movie."
1,Not Happy,"This product did not work as it was supposed to. The PC USB is useless. Not happy with product, cheap and never worked as advertised. I don't think it ever worked from the day we received it. All of these adapters and DDR products are broken or don't work."
5,Great Multi Tool,"I spent some time looking around on-line at all the various multi tools available, I had narrowed the field down to Gerber tools but which one? The price is what finally made up my mind for me, at [price] it is a great deal.So far the tool has performed perfectly, the action to release the pliers works quite well ( and satisfies my juvenile delinquent self with its switch blade like opening ). The only item I wished that it had is a lanyard hole so I could tie the thing to my wrist. I spend a lot if time sailing so things dropped are things gone by-by."
1,Just Plain Awful,"I usually like most movies Johnny Depp is in but this has to be one of his absolute worst movies ever! Everything about this was horrible, it was so predictable and incredibly boring that you have to laugh! OMG I can't believe they are trying to sell this load of garbage. This was so bad it actually motivated me to waste more of my time to write a review!! Save your time and $$$!"
2,Not for me,"I rented this movie from Amazon and did not read the book. The film is about a writer that drinks a lot that is hired by a practically worthless newspaper in Puerto Rico. The story rambles, has no real plot, there are a few funny Johnny Depp moments, but really left me wanting more from that 2 hours of my life.The scenery was good and Amber Heard is hot hot. If you are looking for something mindless and have 2 hours to waste, this might work. Otherwise, I wouldn't see it."
3,johnny,Not a bad movie. Traditional Depp as far as content. But he's always good to look at no matter what part he's playing.
4,Hunter's Least-Known Work,"If anyone is expectingFear and Loathing in Las Vegas, they will be disappointed. The two aren't very much alike, aside from being based on books by Hunter S. Thompson.A good movie, but I think that it will appeal mostly to fans of Hunter's."
2,Very difficult to connect with,"I haven't read the book so I approached this movie without any knowledge of what to expect. The Rum Diary is an improbable story of a bunch of alcoholic journalists in Puerto Rico who do a range of different things revolving around alcohol but not much to develop any sort of traditional plot. Johnny Depp overacts his way through the piece almost like Jack Sparrow without make-up and very rapidly becomes the least interesting character in the film.While I'm sure the original material is an highly entertaining collection of anecdotes, it simply doesn't add up to a film (or at least not this one). We kept pushing through 20 minutes at a time but by the two-third mark it was clear that nothing was going to happen. Fans of HST may enjoy this but coming in fresh makes it hard to connect with any of the characters or really appreciate or understand the material."
1,Lousy,"The most boring and pointless movie of the decade. I sincerely don't know what this movie is about. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, there's no plot, and the acting by Giovanni Ribisi couldn't be more obnoxious and fake."
3,RUM DIARY,"The movie was ok, maybe because we rented a HD version and the picture quality was terrible, not sure why. I would not buy this movie, Depp has done better for sure."
5,A Real Cliff-Hanger,"This is a really first-rate thriller! Charity McLaughlin is a young lawyer who must decide whether or not to take a case that is both intriguing and risky to her mental health. The author does a great job of weaving the personal with the professional, giving the reader a wonderful picture of the demons Charity must overcome. Anyone who likes mysteries should not miss this book. I could hardly put it down."
2,Remember when he was young...,"Set the control for the heart of the problem, and you'll find out, that Waters days are over. You can sing as you used to in PF, you can hire good players to play as PF used to, but it just wouldn't work. Fans can find in the CD good moments to enjoy, but the taste is not the same, though everybody plays well and does his job, and the quality is great, as usual. ""Set the control for the heart of the sun"" is the best here, but doesn't justify buying 2 CD's. Sorry, Roger, but I know just the perfect band for you."
5,My favorite Christmas album,"If you are looking for a devotional Christmas CD, you can't go wrong with this one. George Beverly Shea sings these traditional Christmas songs with such sweet expression! The love of the Gospel is clearly evident in his voice. The accompaniment is lovely and is very well matched with his presentation. His versions place the focus on Christ, not on himself. It is a great collection for ""putting Christ back into Christmas!"""
5,An Ocean of Information for the Very Young,"Have you ever tried to explain the water cycle to little ones who ask where does the rain comes from? Kersten Hamilton has taken this sometimes confusing subject and made it easy for youngsters to understand, taking them through the process step by step. Her rhyming text, full of imagery and expressive detail, begins with the ocean and the bright sun that raises a mist to the sky and continues on to clouds and rain, explaining each step until the water from rivers and streams slips back into the ocean to begin the cycle all over again. Lorianne Siomades bold, colorful illustrations are charming and add just the right touch. Perfect for children 3-7, This is the Ocean is a fascinating and engaging picture book."
2,Bad Update,"Bruce Tegner had an older version of this book, where he actually demonstrated the techniques, and it even had tips on defending against a knife. Although there are better books on the subject, I would try to find the out of print version, rather than waste time on this. This book was just watered down karate."
4,"Compelling anecdotes, unreliable suggestions","A key fault of this book is its vague suggestion that most of its strategies have universal applicability. Often, particular financing methods work only for specific sectors in specific regions. These limitations are rarely addressed.On balance, however, it is worth reading if you buy small businesses. The key theme -- that buyers and sellers should look at a deal from all angles -- is important. The market for small businesses is oddly homogeneous; business brokers would have you believe the only way to buy/sell is with a down payment, and seller paper. Nothing could be further from the truth. Deals can be assembled in countless ways, often on far more advantageous terms, both for sellers and buyers."
4,LMR200 waste receptacles,"I am happy with the pricing - the plastic is a teeny tiny thinner than littermaid replacements - so not as sturdy as the actual littermaid receptacles and requires getting used to, and otherwise ok. I will buy them again.fast delivery"
5,Best deal on these yet!,"I have purchased the actual Littermaid receptacles that didn't fit as well as these. Delivery took a little longer than I thought it should but I was down to my last three when I ordered! You know you're going to need them, buy them in bulk."
5,Some Bodaciously Phat Dixie Tracks.,"That's right: this disc is comprised of some bodaciously phat Dixieland tracks performed by the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet. The elegance of the combo of clarinet, soprano, piano, bass, and drums makes this music the real deal."
3,Who are the targetted customers of this book???,This book tries to say too much in one volume which makes it confusing to novices as well as experienced users of Oracle. I think it should have maintained a consistency in the level of the contents. But there is a lot to learn from this book.
1,How many errors can you find?,"If you can't find at least 10 errors before you finish Chapter 1, you're just not paying attention. You'll find typos, incomplete or incoherent sentences, grammatical errors, punctuation errors, etc. If the authors are that careless during the inroduction, how can you trust their technical information? Thank goodness I didn't open the CD-ROM -- I'm returning this junk (2nd edition) asap. The authors should be ashamed of publishing such careless and sloppy work."
4,A welcome addition into the role playing world.,"I'm not sure if I take to everything that the Everliving has to offer -- the communal protaganists (i.e., everyone trades off characters) comes immediately to mind -- but the overall effect is well worth the time and effort to wade through the book.This game is for those who wish to play a contemporary fantasy world (a la, White Wolf's World of Darkness) without the angst and goth overtones. Most importantly of all, the game has a setting that causes the players into doing something rather than bemoaning their existence.The Book of the Unliving is a must buy for all RPG-philes."
5,Catherine Blair returns with a winner!,"This was one of the more thought-provoking romances I have read in a long time. There are a lot of issues in this book and Catherine Blair has done a really good job in weaving all the elements and story line together smoothly. It is refreshing to see an Regency author that believes that not all men that went off to fight in the Napoleonic wars were heros that came back home without a twinge on their consciences. Viscount Hunter is full of guilt and rage and unfortunately chooses to try and deal with his problems on his own. His young wife, Amelia Harrow, is deliberately shut out of his life. She eventually comes to understand what drives her husband and grows up during the process. Do give this book a read, I highly recommend it!"
1,Waste of time unless you want to read all the heroes books,I have to say I was let down by this book. I basically thought that this book stunk. I was so tired of Galen rambling on and hiding whenever danger happened. I have read 32 Dragonlance books so far and by far this was the worst one. I just finished it so I can one day complete reading all the DL books. Honestly I think it was a waste of time and just drawn out. Save your money and don't buy this book.
5,Favorite Dragonlance Book of this 13-year-old!,"Galen is the youngest son of a knight. His eldest brother is supposed to become a knight, but is not very knightly. The second eldest is... well... shall we say weird? He goes into a lot of trances, is very religious, and gets the dates mixed up; birthdays for Galen and his oldest brother come too often - they don't complain, considering the fact they get extra gifts.One day, when a knight is visiting and staying with them, Galen is confronted by a man who bribes (and threatens) him into stealing the guests armor. Seeing that this knight is going to have Galen's oldest brother as his squire, and squires are supposed to protect the armor, Galen isn't really keen on doing this. Unfortunately for him, he has to - and is caught in a plot of family rivalry and curses."
1,"APEX: Affordable, Pretty, Enticing, and in need of an X-ray","I was enticed by the price of my machine. I was $... and some change, small and space saving, and the shiny silver coloring which matched my bedroom made me think that this was perfect. Well I purchased my dvd player in November of 2002 and as of 8/19/2003, I'm back to watching tapes. I am very disappointed in this item. As others have stated, the pictures started freezing, and with one movie, I had no sound. I will never buy an Apex item again and will recommend to others not to either.APEX (Affordable-Pretty-Enticing-X-Ray needed)Thanks for listening to me vent."
1,Be careful! You get what you pay for...,"We purchased the Apex 1600 at Christmas as an additional dvd player in our home, after being very satisfied with the Apex 1500 (its prior generation and it's still working). Right after expiration of the 90 day warranty, however, the 1600 no longer plays movies. In fact, it can't recognize whether or not a dvd is in the player anymore. We did have warning signs from the start--a loud, mechanical whirring noise that was at times louder than the movie itself. If yours is making this noise and is still under warranty, contact the company and get it repaired. Otherwise, you will need to send it back to Apex and they will charge you $39 for repairs. We, instead, have decided to spend more and purchase a better DVD player."
3,Sony is not much better,"I have not used any Apex brand electronics, so I don't have opinion about this. But my Sony DVD player stop working at less than two years, at three times of this price."
3,Design Flaw - But Decent for Price,"This DVD player is fine for someone on a budget, but it has a major design flaw. You have to manually push the ""power"" button on the unit to turn it on/off - as the power button on the remote is rather useless (you can turn the unit off, but not on with the remote). It's one of those power buttons that actually is raised when it is off, which reminds me of 1985 televisions. Otherwise, the unit is pretty good - it plays VCDs, MP3s, and pretty much everything in between. If you can deal with the irritating power button, get this unit - it'll save you a good deal."
4,Great little player!,"So far it can play everything I can put in it. Wish it had optical digital audio instead of coax. I can't really tell the difference in sound, but I already had a fiber optic cable. I don't really like the remote. It is too small. Other than the above it is an excellent choice for a DVD player. I would highly recommend!"
1,Piece of Crap,"Lasted for exactly under one year, of barely using it at all.Now it's having disc and door problems, like everyone else."
1,Complete Junk,"My mother-in-law surprised me on our 5 year old's birthday with one of these gems. This is by far the worst DVD player on the market. We went through (returned) two of thee before I just gave up.Problems include not being able to load the disk, loading drawer falling off hinge, and loud motor noise when running disk. I would say 80% to 90% of the time the device wouldn't even recognize there was a disk in the device and if it did it would take 10 to 15 minutes to even start the disk.Don't bother. You're paying for what you get in this particular case."
2,Not as nice as I had hoped,"I got a full-spectrum lamp thinking it would produce high-quality light for my office. The lamp was OK, but I wasn't happy with the quality of the light. It says it should be like ""sunlight"", but the light is bluish and cold, like a florescent. I wanted something more yellow, like the GE ""Reveal"" bulbs, that render nice warm colors.The lamp also doesn't have a cover over the bulb to diffuse the light, so it is too bright for my office. Furthermore, there is only one screw holding the bulb into the fixture, and the screw pulled loose from the plastic shade. The bulb fell out of the lamp and shattered on my desk. I tried to get a replacement, but the bulbs are expensive and I haven't bothered.I expected more from a $90 lamp."
4,New and original,"I have read this, the second book of the series as well as the first. The story line of ugly duckling to beautiful prince is amusing, especially since the boy is still the same inside, a oversensitive geek who cries a lot. The character is actually a little too pretty and femine looking. There is some lewdness and even a ""in bed after sex"" scene which I think was the most shocking scene I have ever read in manga, which is usually such a tease and dissapoint genre. I will definetely keep buying this series if only because it is different! Just to be forewarned, the read is a bit confusing, get into this if you are already into manga and used to the format."
2,NOT worth the $$,"I was surprised to find how displeasing this book was, because these folks write a magazine. Perhaps that does not make them good writers. Pathetic lack of pictures. The ""things"" the ferret ""says"" range from funny to redundant to lame, more of the latter than the former. You can go a few pages, and not chuckle. There are some insightful phrases (rarely are there sentences) but there are also large amounts of fragmented ideas: I could have better spent the time reading something more intellectually stimulating. I have a great sense of humor, I read MAD and Reader's Digest Life in these US, for ex, but I found this selection lacking. Its most appreciative audience would be a 10 year old ferret lover."
5,Super!,I love this tool. I use the pliers the most. Very strong well built tool. It's great that you have that many tools on your side.
4,Perfect tool,"This has it all. If you dont want to carry around a hundred tools, this one toll does a hundred things"
1,Pliers poorly designed. Pinch fingers badly,"The way the pliers are designed, if what you're gripping slips off, the handles slam shut and will pinch your fingers badly. It's happened over and over. Pretty pointless to design it that way, unless you plan to use the pliers for tweezer-like work. Don't waste your money. The flaw is inherent with its design (pliers slide in to lock unit closed.)"
1,Disappointed!,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan. Read all the books, seen all the movies, played all the games. That said.This was by far the worst HP game ever. (all the other ones were good just not this one)In a nutshell the graphics, music and voice acting are all beautifuly done. Amazing even. What sucks about this game is that you spend all of your time cleaning up the castle or else searching for useless stuff. There is no health meter so Harry never has to really fight or worry about being in any danger. There are no big bosses to battle or even little bosses. You spend the majority of your time rehanging portraits, straightening up lopsided suits of armor or fixing broked statues. Essentially, Harry is a janitor. Or if you prefer, custodial engineer. Either way it is a waste of time."
4,Basic Plan Book,"This is a good, basic plan book for elementary teachers. I bought several and have used them for the past two years. I'd like better paper quality and a few changes in format, but overall it's pretty good for the price."
3,The title let me astray...,"The pages and projects shown in this book are very attractive, but I'm a complete newcomer to scrapbooking and the tools used. I'd hoped for a guide to how to USE the all these new gizmos, complete with helpful tricks and cautions, step-by-step instructions and lots of how-to photographs - not ideas about more things to make with them. Since I'm new and have no experience with this equipment, I can't even give an example of the sort of helpful tips I was seeking. Sigh! I expect I'll have more appreciation for all the lovely project ideas once I've actually gotten some successful experience with my new tools through trial and error. I'd hoped to avoid the 'error' part of that process with the help of this book ..."
4,BOWING OUT WITH GRACE,"2 great tracks weighing in at just over 6 minutes each. The tracks here are far more focused and concentrate on building up. There are no vocals (which I kind of prefer, although Slint's narration style vocals are great), the music is very fuzzed out and is reminiscent of a more punked out Explosions In The Sky.Some say this is their best work. I say it is among their best work. If the tracks where longer and more developed, with a higher degree of build up / release, then 5 stars would have been awarded. For the price and considering its still available, you should get this right away as no Slint fans or post-rock fans would be let down.p.s at the end of the last track their is a buzzing drone for about 30 seconds with the music slowly dying in the background. This part can really fcuk with ones head when high."
5,Your Slint Collection Is Incomplete...,"...without this in it. Seriously, this could be Slint's greatest work on record."
3,Different but had defects,This is an okay product but I couldn't use it right away without modifying the bottom (i.e. cutting material away). It looks as pictured and definitely grabs other people's attentions but it is not really padded and if you drop the unit I would be afraid it would still end up damaged. I ended up ditching it for the Speck Rugged case instead.
2,an ephemeral flag,"As others have noted, this is not a flag for outdoor display. It lasted less than two months of use on an outdoor flagpole before beginning to shred. For indoor use, it would be acceptable in appearance and durability, but it simply is not suitable for display outdoors in an area subject to even moderate winds."
3,You can use with out a 3.5in floppy,"You do not need to have a floppy drive to use this program. If you use a USB flash drive instead. The program asks you to put a disk into drive A so you will have to rename your USB flash drive as A. In windows 7 right click computer and choose manage, under storage choose disk management. Right click your USB drive then click change drive letter and path. Click change,select assign letter and drive, choose A in the drop down menu. Click ok and then yes when it asks you if you wish to continue. I hope this helps those who already purchased it and are frustrated!! :)"
4,As good as proposed to be,"I've used it for a while, for personal use only. At an open field, the are no whispers, no interferences, OK for my needs. With lots of buildings around it's impossible to ear something."
5,Lots of room!,"Lots of room, great stickers. This is a great calender for busy parents/kids. It has a space for parents and a space for kids. It also comes with stickers and has a space on the side for any extra notes."
1,Avoid this book at all cost.,"The whole book is just a few pages with charts displaying trendlines and stochastics. The author shows us how he uses these trendlines. All this had been available for a century in all other books, and now is available for free on internet."
3,Hmmm....,"I got this machine in order not to be drowned in coins from change from whatever small item purchase I am making. The changer is a bit too clunky. I'm sure if you actually wore the changer when you use it it would be relatively easy to use, but if you are holding it with one hand to drop coins in another, it's hard to use."
2,Ok product,I bought this item brand new for work but when i got it...it looked used already and the edges curl up and are sharp. All in all i needed it so i still use it but it was rusty and used looking when i got it! I work in a casino and i leave it in my apron overnight and im not in the food and beverage department so i dont know where the rust came from.
2,"Item corroded & not what pictured, but functional","This Coin changer was purchased to use at a yard sale, and is adequate for that, but I considered returning it because the metal is corroded, not shiny and does not have the plastic guard piece to protect from gouging anything you walk by. The function is OK, but the box was mangled, leading me to believe I was sold a very used item posted as new."
1,Terrible product! Don't buy it!,"I had a small triangular tear in my favorite nylon jacket. This product makes a lot of claims on its package, so I thought I would try it, even though it seemed expensive. It made a mess! It's thin and runny (and yes, I shook it up as per the directions). It didn't dry clear, looks terrible, and worst of all - it didn't stick the tear together at all! My jacket is much worse off than if I had just left the little tear alone. This product should be banned! I am going to go back to the store I bought it from, and tell them to stop offering it for sale."
5,"Fast, efficient transaction",This vendor really delivers on product quality as well as prompt processing. The medical equipment was first quality.
1,Ambiguous Morality Kills it's Aspirations,"Having at one time worked for a very wealthy family, I understand the dynamics that can exist within this enviornment. However, the main character is so vague within his sense of self to render the tale ambiguous and unsatisfying. Repeatedly, we're asked to make very fine moral judgements that do not jibe with either the characters or the tone. This could have been a much more interesting book."
1,Not getting a second chance...,"This book is not the tell-all I was hoping for. Similar other trashy novels were at the very least humorous. This work was very poorly written and boring. I always make several attempts push through books, especially debuts. The one good thing I can say is that I was able to get a full refund."
3,Not so hot!,Having lots of technical problems with it. Have returned to twice to the factory (once for the recall and once for dropping all the information every other day). Seem to battle more with it than really have it be my companion. Nice features when it works.
1,Be afraid,"As one of the first ones to buy a Toshiba e740, I have had nothing but troubles since the day I bought it. I paid close to $500 for it back then.My advice to anyone considering a Toshiba Pocket PC is check the forums and customer feedback. It's all bad. Anyone want to buy a $500 paperweight?"
1,Worst PDA ever?,"I purchased the e740 last year, and was hoping for a great pda to prevent me from lugging around my laptop. Wrong. From day one, this pda has never performed as promised. The most annoying problem is that it will run down the battery even though the pda is off. So, the next morning when you turn it on, the battery is dead. If you haven't kept your backups up to date, you are going to be in trouble. You will then have to reinstall all applications and settings. There is no fix for this problem either, and I have searched far and wide. In addition, the e740 is rather slow, despite having an advertised speed of 400mhz. Microsoft Active Sync never performs well with the pda, as it duplicates contacts, notes, tasks, at almost every opportunity. This is really a poor product, and should be steered clear of. The only thing it does well, is play mp3's."
2,Love the WiFi - hate most everything else,"I love the integrated WiFi. But that is about it. Mine was included in the recall. I sent it back and they fixed that problem. But the device hard resets (and you lose everything) if you accidentally unlock the battery, which is extremely easy to do. It drops the USB ActiveSync connection after a few minutes of connection. The battery sometimes runs down to quick. The record button is located in a bad place - to easy to hit when taking out of the carrying case. Not ready for prime time."
2,Toshiba e740 - BUYER BEWARE,"I have an e740, it is 3 months old, and works well. However Toshiba has decided to orphan all e740's in the Pocket PC 2003 upgrade process. Frankly Toshiba has not supported the e740 well in any sense, including releasing updates in one country, but not another.I would love to recommnend this device, but instead I am compelled to say ""Buyer Beware!"""
4,Very good PDA... but others are right about record button,The Toshiba E740 is everything it should be. ...and I considered it a very good value when compared to the IPAQ and Dell Axion.Two areas where it is weak is in assessories and the voice record button. Hopefully there will be more third party vendors offering assessories in the near future. Users must be careful not to accidently bump the record button. I have drained the battery by accident numerous times. Thankfully I have all files backed up on the SD memory card. I have also found it hard to get the CompactFlash Type II memory cards from local stores or on the internet.
2,Amnesiac PDA,I have to agree with the other reviewers- the Toshiba seemed to lose memory entirely too easily.
1,Listen to the Warings!!!!,"I used the e740 for 1.5 months. During that time I had to reload all my data at least 4 times (it's easy to hit the battery release on the side). As others have noted, I was constantly hitting that stupid record button on the side. I had a Handspring Deluxe for 3 years and had to reload maybe twice during that time.Battery life is terible. You will have to lug the charger anytime you go away for a weekend -- totally ridiculous.Even though I was able to get a great deal on the unit, I grew to hate it very quickly. I've now sold it and purchased a Sony Clie SJ33 and simply love it. It is an asset. The toshiba was a liability -- just bad engineering."
5,Great Pocket PC,"This is a great pocket pc. It's small and powerful. It fits in your pocket nicely, great screen, the SD and CF slot are a big plus, you can expand it, I recently purchased the Targus CF modem and works great. The only thing I don't like about this product is the voice recorder button, it was put in a place where it should not be, whenever you try to take it out of its case, you press the button. However, even with this small problem, it is a great pocket pc, better than palm. Ooo, and it also has the great wireless WIFI capability, not to many PDAs have this feature. GREAT PDA!!!"
1,Not worth a penny!!!!,This thing stinks. The battery runs out before you can even get working. WLAN capabilities are worthless. The unit is junk. They should buy these back!! There is a good reason the price keeps dropping.I would consider Dell Axim x3i for the low budget (<$300) or the HP 5550 ($600) for the higher end folks.
2,No visible means of support,"This is a very well equipped pocket PC that unfortunately has little or no support from Toshiba. The system ships with several significant bugs intact and no appearant plans for correcting them by the manufacturer. If supported, this would be a fantastic unit, but Toshiba seems to be focused on selling instead of supporting what they've sold.The latest of issues with the PPC is the stated intention of Toshiba to not offer an upgrade to the new PPC 2003 OS. This is not just a 'nice to have' feature with this item, it is a must have due to the inadequate support for wireless connectivity in version 2002. The upgrade would go a long way to correcting many of the issues that the e740 has right now. I would not recommend this or any other Toshiba PDAs to friends or family due to their lack of customer support."
1,This is a screenplay not a novel,"This reads like a poor adaptation of a screenplay (or teleplay, I guess). It's just a lot of dialogue, interspersed with simple descriptions. Even internal thoughts are described in quotation marks! The writing itself is simplistic, almost childish.Nothing is gained from this as compared to watching the television series - which, unlike this novel, was executed with some style.The book's marketing itself borders on false advertising. In fact, it probably crosses over the line into false advertising. The cover of the book prominently features Tom Price - one of the most interesting characters in the TV series - but Tom does not appear in this ridiculous ""novel."""
4,"Small world, saw on TV last night","This is not a zombie book but rather one about the end of the world as we know it. A plaque sweeps England, and the world. Those very few survivors must try to adapt to the new world. Its not that easy. Good writing and the plot moves along nicely. I found the book better then the TV show, I guest the book leaves more to the imagination."
1,Quality equal to the low price !!,"Buy a cheap player, expect low quality!! I strongly recommend paying a little more for a better known brand with comparable features.1. Component output was not working on the unit I got. There was no signal on the PB channel. All my pictures were shades-of-red-only!!2. I had to do a +2% tilt correction on my TV to get the picture orientation correct.3. The disc tray is so shaky and fragile you feel that it will break at the slightest extra pressure."
2,Low quality,"I bought 2500 DVD player in Sep. 2003, and now it's broken. There is no vedio output anymore. Sometimes the disc can get stuck in the tray. But the DVD play does have more features than other DVD players. You get what you pay for."
1,Quality Control,"The price was right and the picture was good. However, I was forced to return two of these DVD players as the first arrived with a large dent in the casing. The replacement arrived with a larger dent in the casing, but on the opposite side. Both boxes were in perfect condition along with the internal packing material. This leads me to believe the item was boxed up and sent this way from the factory. The price is low but I guess the adage holds true that you get what you pay for. It's a shame as I'm sure a lot of work went into packing this many features into a unit and keeping the price as low as they have."
1,"Began to fail after 6 months, gone in 10.","I purchased this player 10 months ago. After six months it began to fail loading the DVDs, giving me the No DVD message. After 10 months of very light use (about 2 DVDs per week) it loads nothing. Pass on this one."
1,Poor image.,"I bought two of these DVD players. Neither produces an image or sound as good as my worst performing VHS player. Play quality is also very irregular. So, don't waste your money . . . buy something else . . . or don't buy anything at all."
3,What can you expect for 60 bucks?,"This is a pretty good DVD player. The Picture is Awesome when its working and the sound is outstanding. Perfect for surround sound (5.1). Everything worked good with a few exceptions. After about 60 minutes of watching a DVD the sound gave out through the optical. Now that doesnt work at all anymore but the analog is still ok. Movie often freeze and frames get skipped, as if too much information was being read by the laser. Mp3 sounds great but some songs would skip on a perfectly clean CD. VCD's don't play too well on this player. Overall this is an ""ok"" product for 60 dollars. Everything else works fine so far. But I'd go with a major name brand next time. I will probably return this item soon."
4,"So Far, So Good","I just recently discovered and purchased the Apex AD-2500 Progressive-Scan DVD Player. I've been searching for one that would play the variety of formats I use, and when I discovered it would actually DO MORE than what it claimed, (unlike many descriptions of other players), I snapped it up. It plays VCD, SVCD, DVD, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD+RW (the biggest surprise!), plus Kodak picture disks, WMA, MP3 and Karoke! A lot of player for the money. It's too new (to me) yet to comment on its durability, but so far, so good."
5,For an off-brand it is really good!,"I had never heard of Apex, but the player is packed with features! Plays discs of JPEG pictures, plays both NTSC and PAL DVDs. Component out and Karaoke input. What else can you ask for? Works great!"
1,one star is 2 stars two many,"i bought this product thinking it was a good deal and i was short on cash. this thing sucks. it is big, loud, and a piece of s--t. it is awful. when i play movies, it makes a really loud and annoying noise. it takes way to long to load and it gets -1 star"
2,so so,They sent two different paddles had to make the other one fit it was disappointing when you can see they are two different parts but where sent as the same part numberO
5,I Need a Big Bar of Shave Soap!,"I don't have time to waste, I have a big mug and need big shaving soap that lathers up a lot in a hurry. The Amber Super Bar by Colonel Ichabod Conk is the perfect choice. I'm all set now that I can easily get this soap through Amazon."
4,Entertainment with a Message,"Very entertaining movie. It's fun to watch our ""Dragon Hunter"" and his side kick/manager and a tag-along annoying little girl journey to battle ""The Dragon"" who has taken ""life"" from the King. The King promises if they are successful he will help them achieve their dreams. Each character has something to learn about life and this journey provides the obstacles to help them learn and change. Very worthwhile watching!"
1,Stupit movie ever seen.,I could not find any good thing to said about this Dragon Hunters movie. Stupit movie for me but my 3 yrs old she like it.
2,Too Gloomy.,"It has a decent storyline with buyable characters. The graphics are very good, but they depict a dark and unrealistic environment, lacking color and life. It is just too gloomy graphically speaking."
1,Not happy.,I ordered 2 units. They were shipped from 2 different locations. Twice the shipping cost.One was completely different and did not work. Never again.
1,It was not what I expected,"I bought the Toshiba because I didn't want to pay the outrageous amount that Compaq wanted for their iPaqs. I also wanted to give the PoketPC OS a try. Well, you get what you paid for. Battery life is terrible and the unit is simply too long physically. The OS, while was nicely done, was overwhelming. I just needed a simple PDA that does what I want and has a long battery life.I returned it and bought another Palm instead."
2,THE TRUTH,The battery is 2 hrs tops not 8 hrs. Any info you are working on will be lost. Who wants to charge the battery every few hours? If you pay for top of the line toshiba they give you the option of buying an external plug in battery. So far other than Bluetooth which limits your range there is no other wireless way to go online. Might as well us your pc at home if you cant go very far.
3,Good for practice,"I bought this book in order to get an idea about the Mathematics Content Specialty Test (CST), which is required in NY state for teacher certification in Mathematics (if the applicant majored in another area).The book contains an actual NTE test (120 questions), complete with answers and very clear explanations. There is no review to help you prepare for the test. The test questions are very low level.I passed the exam very comfortably, in May 11 2002. The exam questions (80 or 100, I don't remember exactly) were remarkably like those in this book, except for a pretty large number of reasoning and analytical questions. Those questions challenged the intelligence of the applicant rather than his/her mathematical knowledge."
1,I wouldn't get this,"I don't know Linksys' definition of compact, but this is a disappointment. It's clunky, the cord is too short and for about $ you can buy a usb hub that actually sends power to your usb devices, this doesn't.i'm still using it, but have purchased a targa version which is much smaller, and provides power to my usb devices. for about $ more."
5,other reviewers missed the point completely....,"our fellow reviewer elonita, seems to have missed the pointonita. this device more or less dangles in back of your computer out of the way, while you plug up to four devices into it. if you need to reach in back of your computer while still having 5 usb ports, there are other options. this is a very nice, compact product and saves alot of pain associated with clunky hubs."
1,need external power,"Without external power (not come with the package), this unit does not work too well. Sorry I bought two for my laptop, I do not want to carry another external power adopter."
1,Way too slow.,"This USB hub is way too slow. It's not a bad product for what it is, but the technology is way outdated."
3,"Good, Easy to use USB Hub","As expected, it works fine.What is unusual is that it always triggers a warning that it could be run at a higher speed.Leads me to believe it's actually wired as a USB 1.1 device, not a USB 2."
3,Review of Linksys USBHUB4C ProConnect Compact USB 4-Port Hub,"If you're working with an older model pc or laptop that is equipped with 1.0 or 1.1 USB ports, then this is the hub for you. However, if like myself, your pc or laptop is equipped with 2.0 USB ports, then this is NOT the hub for you. I didn't realize it was not a 2.0 device when I purchased it (I assumed it was since it was offered as part of a special with a 2.0 USB cable). When I plugged the hub in to my laptop, I kept getting an error message referring to the speed of this newly installed device - only then did I realize that the hub was not a high-speed 2.0 device. I didn't bother returning it, as it was only a few dollars, but I'm a little disappointed that the product description didn't mention the speed of the device (it only refers to it as 'high-speed'). Oh well. I have since ordered a D-Link 7-port high-speed (2.0) hub (...) that I'm sure I'll be happy with."
3,"Worked well at first, not working well now","At first this item worked well. However, after a couple of months it started disconnecting my USB devices from my computer and then reconnecting them -- my computer would think that I had unplugged the peripherals and replugged them, although I hadn't touched them at all. This would happen at random moments and when I had not moved or touched the computer, peripherals, and cords at all. Just a note, I used all 3 or 4 ports on the hub at a time when this occured. Maybe mine is defective, but I can see why I got it for so cheap."
4,Sometimes can't get enough USB slots...,"I bought this product because of a friend's recommendation. I've been complaining that my computer doesn't have enough USB slots (for flash drives, mouse, etc.). This product sounded like it's the perfect solution for my problem.For the most part, it was. It did serve its purpose, at least for me. But my friend who recommended it found that the hub connection is just that. A connection. She's saying that the connection is not ""powered"", and another device has to be attached to it so it becomes ""powered"". So far, I haven't really found the need to ""power"" the hub, since the devices that I normally use pretty much function with it.I still think It's a pretty good deal for its Amazon.com price."
5,Chicken Hunter may be same as Moorhuhn X,We think this is the same as a game we had called Moorhuhn X in Germany. My daughter likes the game. She played it and discovered the golden key hidden in the tree which unlocks a special Moorhuhn artillery. She also discovered how to reveal the inside of the outhouse and unlock the safe with the key. She likes to make the tree sneeze. A kindergartner can easily get a lot of points at this game. Seller was a prompt shipper.
5,Rocknoceros,This is a delightful CD with clever words for children to enjoy and real music for adults to enjoy. Some of the songs are written to teach; some of the songs are written to make you laugh; and all of the songs are written to make you want to dance.
2,small imperfection,"OK product, pretty much the way it is described on the website. However, when the cover is closed, one edge does not close completely. You can tell that it is about one-quarter inch off the base of the ottoman. Since I didn't exchange for a new one, I don't know if it is just mine or it's a problem with all the units."
5,Existential Adventure,"This book is a great read, a fascinating ""crossing the north sea chase adventure"", but it is also an internal adventure and a social exploration. Does a bowl from antiquity imply that Jesus accepted homosexuality? Who are the various people trying to capture the bowl, and for what exremely different purposes? Lots of fun, and also quietly moving."
4,Exactly what a game needs to be,"The game is fun, easy to follow and educating.the graphics are good and in detail. One thing the game slacks is on the choices for gods, they have combine the same units for different gods."
1,I was excited til it messed up my computer.,"I was definitely excited to get this purchased game cause I absolutely love mythology. When i received it and installed it, It played up until before the main menu. It wouldn't install correctly and I had all the requirements for the game. I was very disappointed as well when my DVD/CD-ROM drive quit after I installed it and I had to reinstall everything on my computer just to get my drive to work again so I will definitely not recommend this just to be on the safe side. It may have just been my computer being weird but it was only after installing this game, nothing else I did changed it."
2,Age of Mythology Gold Edition,My DVD/CD ROM won't read the game. i love the game and all but it just won't download. I've tried a lot. I was wondering if you had any solution. If not than can i have a refund?
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!,"I had never given this topic much thought until I saw the special on FOX and I immediately got on the web to see what other resources were avaialable. ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon"" caught my attention immediately and I couldn't wait to purchase a copy! This was definitely one of the most interesting and insightful video presentations that I have ever witnessed and I know that this is going to make quite an impact on society as we know it! I am a college professor and not easily persuaded with ""propaganda"" pieces and I do not normally jump on the bandwagon of ""conspiracy theories."" This time, however, this compelling evidence was too much to ignore. The video presents all of the evidence and facts, but still respects viewers enough to allow you to draw your own conclusions based on what you've seen. BRAVO!!!!!!! This is a WINNER!"
1,An insult to anybody with an IQ over 10,"This video is one of the biggest pieces of trash that I have ever seen! The only people who would believe the garbage spewed in this cheesy video are those who believe that The Wizard of Oz is a documentary. Please remember that spending any money on this video puts money in the pockets of a lunatic ""filmmaker"" who harasses astronauts so much that a 70+ year old Buzz Aldrin, in order to protect himself, decks the obnoxious filmmaker with a punch to the snout!"
1,Confusing,"I give this movie 1 star because it's confusing. I don't know if we ever went to the moon, and that makes me sad, because I did meet E.T. BEFORE he starred in the movie. O.K. There's absolutely no reason that Stephen Spielberg had to open his chest, and nearly kill him just to make a movie. I mean, sheesh, if it hadn't been for silly willy space putty holding his chest together, he'd not be able to show up on the Hubble telescope next year. Peace out, and nanoo nanoo yo."
4,Stops drip leaks,"Stops dripping or slow leaks well.If you have a real high pressure leak, naturally call a plumber."
5,Happy with my OXO trash can,"The can arrived quickly and was as pictured. 10 gal is just right, not too small or too large. Because the item was refurbished, it had a slight dent on the side, which was described on the site as minor cosmetic damage, and which I would agree with. I might try hammering it out from the inside later. The step pedal is very responsive and opens all the way, which is really convenient when your hands are full."
2,ehh,"while i relaly like both of these artists, this cd did not do much for me. it didnt go anywhere. it was very boring. for me it falls into the group of experimental cds that would be fun to play, but nto relaly fun to listen to.stick to these guys other works.just my opinion though. :)"
5,Great glasses,"One of the best sports sunglasses made. If you live in the desert like I do, you may want to consider the amber ones instead."
4,great mix of music,"the ""Just the Best"" series is a great compilation of music. Everything from dance, rap, and harder stuff. Most of the songs are hard to get, and are in frequent radio play in Europe. Some of the songs have crossed over to the states, all of them should. Also a great deal due to it being a double CD. If you want a great mix of songs, great for parties, this is what you want to get."
1,"Darth Vader shows his true colors, do not rebuke God.","Reg Dwight, is not Elton John, but Elton John is Darth Vader, he is very wise in the ways of the force, but you must resist him at every turn, he is the leader of the evil empire, only Luke can defeat him with the help of obe one, my call is to all the Jedi rebellion, if you read this and you are truly wise in the way of the force this message should come as no surprise to you, Vader must be resisted."
2,BLANDMAN ACROSS THE WATER,"Dear Sir Elton:Please make one more rocking album before you retire ! Songs from the West Coast sounds like he phoned it in. I don't expect every track to be genius, but perhaps some reflection somewhere of his talent! The reviewers who gave this album 5 stars need to dust off their copies of Tumbleweed Connection or Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and compare. There's no rock in Songs from the West Coast. Only Lion King mid tempo assembly line MacMusic. Listen to Burn down the Mission or Take me to the Pilot and then you will hear what Sir Elton is capable of. I love the earlier stuff - and this isn't even close"
5,Elton John CD,"I loved the songs on this album. Most of them have not been widely played but I think it is my favorite Elton John album. One song, ""This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore"" is especially good."
5,Excellent,This C.D. is clearly some of elton's best work ever. In my book it is right behind Honky Cat and Goodbye yellow brick road as his best work ever. The only songs I don't care for are Birds and Mansfield they are just fillers. They're many hidden gems in here including the much uderated Dark Diamond and the Wasteland
5,Genius,"Captain Fantastic, Rocket Man, Honky Cat, EJ, Elton John - They all did a great job on this CD. The Great Musical Genius batted .500 with this 'West Coast'. By that I mean there are truly six of 12 unbelievably GREAT songs. Five of five stars. There are two 4 star songs and the rest are four and a half. The Fives are Emporer's New Clothes, American Triangle, Original Sin, The Wasteland, Ballad of the Boy With the Red Shoes, And This Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore. All Classic EJ, which of course are far better than mere musician's classics. Well worth listening to over and over. I always judge good music with the idea that a good song isn't always catchy the first listen, but gets better each time and grows ageless. These six songs are like that. The others are real damn close."
2,ELTON HAS LOST IT!,"Since the heartbreaking elegy for Princess Diana in 1997, Sir Elton John has descended into the gloom and stasis of inertia. It was like the final spark before extinguishment. This new album left me distinctly unmoved and unimpressed. Unlike ""Made In England"" & ""The Big Picture"", where one could feel the uncanny creativity, clever composition and cascade of oomph...this collection of songs is at best...""average"". This is like the obituary to his career. A little footnote marking the beginning of the end! Sad!!!"
4,you gotta know what it is,"the last review was obviously a little onesided, ill try to be a bit more desciptive...this is essentially a collection of outtakes, japanese record distributors often require outside artists to include extra tracks on thier japanese releases, trans am didnt want the american public to have to buy import cds to get this material so they gathered it all up and released it...as it stands its a good document of trans am, what they do and how they do it, but as an album, it may not gel as well as the others, but thats the nature of a ""best of"" type collection...if you like creative instrumental rock i recommend trans am, they can move from straight up hard edged powertrio stuff, to electro pop, to ambient textures, to flat out hard volume clipping noise, and back again with phenominal grace and no pretention..."
5,Phat Alto Sound,"This CD is Butter! The sophomore release by alto man Bruce Williams as a leader (the first was Brotherhood) showcases not only his beautiful round tone and technique but a depth of emotion not usually offered to the listener in this age of cool young lions. He literally screams through his horn. On another track you can hear him whisper gently. Up tempo numbers as well as ballads will have you on ""random repeat"" all day. This young saxophonist has a lot to say and this CD is just the preface."
3,Its...alright,This gun is cheap plastic...I ordered the one with the scope and laser sight...they sent me one with none of those on it. The thing shoots pretty hard but because its such cheap plastic you get 4 maybe 5 games before the stock will break away from the rest of the gun. Because of how hard it shoots though it definitly deserves at most a 3 out of 5
5,A good buy.,They were as represented and had the lowest price that I could find. They are made in China and are not as sharp as the old originals but still a good buy.
5,A Must Read!,"""Among the Brave"" is a riveting tale from the Shadow Children series by Margaret Haddix. This adventure has Trey in the spotlight and he is on a mission to the Population Police Headquarters. The Population Police reinforces the population laws/regulations of having only two children per household. Trey despite his middle name Cowardice develops into a character that is obtaining attention and gaining respect. Trey puts himself into life threatening situations in order to help rescue friends who are being held against their will by the Population Police. The suspense of this book will lead you from page to page, and eventually you will come to a screeching halt (the final page of chapter thirty-five).Haddix continues her stride on the Shadow Children series without coming to a standstill. If you have read the previous books this one will not leave you empty handed. Haddix continues the magic!"
1,Great Movie,Had seen this on TV and wanted to add it to our Christmas collection so we could watch with out commercials.
4,Holiday pleasures!,"I have always enjoyed Ernest Borgnine and when I found he had made a Christmas movie I was thrilled. It is not a weighty story, but it is a very nice feel good holiday movie with several stars in it. Great family movie!"
4,"Wholesome, warm movie for the family","I enjoyed this film, it's a wholesome, warm family film with a happy ending :) This film appeals to old and young alike with a cast of older actors Ernest Borgnine, Katherine Helmond, Jamie Farr, and Tom Virtue and a young actress Juliette Goglia. It's got a unique plotline, and some fun scenes that made me smile. The music act was a surprise, I expected something newer, instead it was old vaudeville type song (I read that it is ""We'll See About That"" written by David Lawrence specially for this film)."
4,Pet Gear Easy Step III,My dogs had never used steps before so this was all new to them. I now have them going up and down the steps with no problems. They dug at the bottom carpet on the steps while they were learning to climb them and messed the carpet up. Is it possible to buy the replacement carpet for this item. Please let me know if possible. My pets love their steps now and use them everyday.
5,"Pet Stairs, 3 steps.....",Easy to assemble and stays in place. Carpeted stairs gives my (old)cat assurance he won't fall off! He doesn't meow at me anymore to lift him up to reach his food on top of the dryer.
2,Not a sure step,"I have a big dog,120 lbs. He did not like the downward angle of the steps. It did not give him a sure step so therefore he would not use it."
2,Why are they slanted?,"We purchased these steps for our Beagle, who suffered a front left leg, shoulder and neck injury. While they are fairly sturdy - she's a chubby 30 lbs. - the slant makes her wary to use. Our vet said that while the slant is probably good for hip problems, it isn't good for front leg problems. Steps would be great if they were like regular steps."
1,Poorly made,The pieces to this product were so mis-stamped that they could not be put together. There was no way the steps could be assembled. The only good thing was that Amazon took the product back with no problems.
2,Tall Pet Steps,"I recently purchase this product about a month ago. I was excited to receive the Steps and the price was great. However, I was quite disappointed when it arrived. I had to assemble the Steps and the quality of the plastic was cheap. I was even more disappointed to find that the carpeted step were attached by 2 flimsy strips of velcro. My Miniature Schanauser easily kicked the pads off climbing the steps. She now uses the Step Pads as a toy and she will not use the stairs in fear of slipping climbing the Steps with NO PADS!!!Very disappointed"
3,Overwhelmed,Steps are made well and seem to be the perfect answer for getting to higher sofas and beds. I have a small 15 pound dog. He is usually not afraid to jump up on anything he thinks he can reach. We have two long sets of stairs which he is very comfortable running up and down. These steps however scare him! After many weeks he will only go UP the steps if I put something on each side so he feels more secure and he still will not go down. I think the angle of the steps and lack of depth are the issue.
3,interesting but could have been better,"The story of the Unabomber is quite fascinating, but I feel it could have been told better. This book could have used some more aggressive editing; some of the writing is downright sloppy and it could have been told just as thoroughly using a lot fewer pages.Here's an example of what bugs me (page 126):Much of their squad's training is done by the FBI and the military. And so one comfort is that if a bomb squad gets ""into a situation that was over your head, it's easy to call for help. You can call military -87th EOD.Where's the editor?The book is worth reading but, as I said, could have been better if some more time had been spent cleaning it up."
1,unbelievable,"I live in Lincoln, Montana and I found a number to statements in this book not true. They may be small statements, not very significant, but in a non-fiction book every statement should be lchecked for truth before being printed. We do not have a bus that goes from Lincoln to Helena. If just one statement is not true, then it makes you wonder what else in the book is not true."
2,Not well built,"Within a few days of having the truck the doors came off. It is a neat looking toy, but not very durable. There are so many parts that can come off it makes it hard to keep track of everything. It didn't work with any of the larger breyer horses my daughter had so we had to buy mini horses to fit in the trailer.Very disappointed with the quality."
3,A Kids Reveiw,This toy is good for showing. my dad got it for me for my birthday and he thought it was going to be biggger for my breyer classics. the back doors wint stay shut
3,Breyer truck and trailer stablemates,"Bought this set for daughter about 3 years ago. Although she plays VERY GENTLY with all her toys, tne truck mirror broke off while opening the box, the brittle fences inside the trailer broke within the first hour and the top falls off continually. Her other toys can look like new for years but not this set. Accurately made and fun for kids but not durable at all. Not far off a 'dollar store' toy. One problem with Breyer toys is getting them out of the box without breaking the toy."
2,Very cheaply made! Shame on you Breyer!,My daughter has collected Breyers for years. This Breyer play set is not worth your money. The plastic is too brittle and the trailer falls apart easily. We also bought our daughter the Playmobil Jeep & Trailer. Buy the Playmobil it is worth the extra money!
2,"Unbelieveable rip-off, very cheaply made","My 6-year old daughter received this toy from her grandmother for Christmas. The only thing that kept me from giving it 0 or 1 star is that my daughter absolutely loves playing with this toy. But, the toy itself is so flimsy, fragile, and poorly made, I really couldn't believe it came from Beyer. Right out of the box, the back doors on the trailer would not stay closed. This has not hindered my daughter's enjoyment, but I wonder how long this piece of junk will last. My mother paid nearly 30 dollars for this (without the horses). It looks much better in advertising than when it arrives. Don't waste your money."
3,Good for Beginners,"""Essential Cross-Country Skier"" is a good handbook for beginner skiers. It is an easy read and probably what you want to get you started.Intermediate level to elite skiers could take issue with many of the technical explainations, for then I would suggest ""Ski ""Skating with Champions"" or ""Tao of Skiing"" but the then, the book ""Essential Cross-Country Skier"" was written by someone who obviously loves the sport and will be enjoyed by those who want to take it up."
5,Masterpiece enhanced,"This is an album of appealing Dylan interpretations and it's enlightening to hear his work from a female perspective. I heard some of Dylan's songs here first and only later experienced his own versions, for example I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine which is definitely very different (and more beautiful to me) in Baez's version.Other great tracks include I Pity The Poor Immigrant (still as relevant as ever), Love Is Just A Four-Letter Word, the heart-breaking Walls Of Redwing (about inmates in a jail), One Too Many Mornings, Boots Of Spanish Leather and Restless Farewell.Everything about this album is just SO RIGHT: her phrasing, the choice of songs and her elegant delivery. This is a classic folk album of the 1960s and also essential listening for Dylan fans. I love it. This re-issue contains two live bonus tracks that were recorded in Japan."
3,"ok, not great","Joan Baez's voice is gorgeous, but the songs are a mixed bag. As a result this is not one of her great albums. Some good cuts, but on the whole a bit disappointing --I'd rather hear that beautiful voice singing some better songs."
3,Notions,"Literature is telling. Genius is listening and telling at the same time. Knowledge is what you know. Listening is what anybody and everybody does. Writing is not talking. A happening is not being existing. Recognition is audience. Writing is not talking because there is recognition. A happening is an event, is outside. How do you feel about anything? Narrative is succession."
5,perfect!,i use this to connect my ipod to the receiver so i can have digital music in the house. Generally stream from Pandora or Slacker. Works flawlessly. Just what we needed so we can have that great ipod music at home.
1,DINGO BALLS,This product was purchased from a vendor who may have had this for a long time because the treats were stale and I will not purchase any more from this vendor. No good recommendation on this one.
4,Bad disk,I play all my DVD media in my xbox 360 so I am now very annoyed that my disk 1 won't play in my xbox only a DVD player. All other seasons have worked perfectly up until now. Otherwise it's one of the the best drama series out there and this is a fine addition to the story and even an improvement on the past season.
3,Bad value for the money,"I am a frequent amazon shopper and am usually 100% satisfied with my purchases, but this was a rip-off!!! I subscribe to Netflix & Hulu Plus(Weeds Season 7 currently not available), so this was my only option. I also have purchased a single movie from Amazon Instant Video in the past, and Amazon's prices are way too high. They DO NOT reflect Amazon.com's fair pricing & standards & need to be adjusted accordingly..."
3,"Not my favorite part of the Weeds story, but necessary","Around this time of the Weeds series, I thought the story got a little weird and somewhat out of character. However, if you were watching the seasons in order (and one after the other like I did), then it is important to see - or lots of the stuff that goes on in the last season won't make sense. Still love the crazy dysfunctional Botwins..."
2,very weak storyline,"Weeds is one of my all-time favorite tv shows and I've seen every season. This is the weakest by far. The storyline wanders around and makes no sense. It's really boring and I could barely finish the season. I've heard Season 8 is just as weak. Maybe they should stopped after season 5 or 6, when it was still a pretty good show."
2,Nothing...,"The length of the Episodes were shortened, the story line was forced and very scattered, too much time invested into Doug, and the sister makes for a very lack luster and watered down version of Mrs. Hodes. I watched the entire season in an afternoon and for that alone I was very discouraged. The Finale alone made me furious, skipping to three months ahead after the show had just skipped 3 years. This was once my favorite show and the only thing I could find to fill the void Buffy left when it went off the air. After season 5 I have regretted buying both season. The show has taken outlandish to a new level and has absolutely crossed the line over to ridiculous."
4,Very funny,Mary Louise Parker is fantastic! They manage to twist the story so many times and still make it so attractive! I started watching the first season on Netflix and then wouldn't resist to buy it the blu-ray of season 7.
2,Disappointed,"This season is really bad, very disappointed! She hasn't learned a thing in prison and her character is horrible. Sad season ending."
5,The Real Deal,"I've bought numerous versions of this cd over the years from an expensive bootleg to other version all released here in Australia as legitimate budget releases, but this is the real McCoy, full concert and good sound quality much better than the other versions that i have bought. This is great concert and this in my top 10 live albums. The Sweet were one of the most underated bands of the 70's, it's shame that they are really only known for their singles as they bought out some great albums."
5,Incredible!,"I found this CD absolutely incredible and amazing! I just got it in the mail and I am absolutely thrilled with the CD! My favorite songs are We're Dancing, and I wanna be. Order this CD quick!"
2,Not as good as other superhero cop dramas,"District X has an average story and the main characters are the villains more than the heroes, including Bishop, who does not get a lot of face time in this book. For more interesting stories and more action, check out Alan Moore's Top Ten or Bendis's Powers series."
3,Sad story that could have used an editor,"While I appreciate the abuse that was described in the book, it read to me like a series of events, lacking the descriptive insight that would make me feel something for the characters. Instead I felt nothing. The writing was rather 'bare bones', with little to no descriptions, or setting scenes, etc. And the editing was atrocious--double periods at the end of sentences, words with no spaces between them, misspelled words, and haphazard (and gratuitous) use of ellipses. And this was in almost every chapter! It certainly distracted me from the story, but I might have been able to overlook it if the writing was more polished and coherent."
1,I didn't care for it.,"The story didn't seem believable..the editing was questionable and I just didn't care for it. I expected much more, I can't recommend it."
1,"decent product, terrible packing","The hangers themselves seem decent for the price but I couldn't believe the way they were shipped by AntOnline. They just bundled the 6 hangers I ordered together and wrapped the bare wood with very sticky tape. The tape left residue all over the wood and since the hangers weren't separated in anyway - with no padding in the box - the wood was also chipped. On top of that, they were disgustingly dusty - they must've been sitting at a warehouse forever. I've been a happy Amazon customer for close to 10 years and this is probably the most disappointed I've been with a purchase - enough for me to write my first negative review. Amazon should cut their ties with AntOnline."
5,Beautifully done!,"I am not a huge fan of church type music in general but having recently discovered some Scandinavian ancestry, was drawn to add to my knowledge and appreciation of those antecedents. Christmas is a very personal and important holiday to me and I was thrilled to hear this recording done in the original language. In my mind's eye I was transported to an earlier time when Christmas was a very important time for all in the community. Values were different and the music imparts this in a very special way. Enjoyment of the music is not dependent on understanding the language either. The music alone is special and the voices of the vocalists only adds to it. I would highly recommend this recording as part of anyone's appreciation of the Scandinavian people and culture."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY,"I have been a Dukes of Hazzard fan since the show first aired. As a fan of the show, you know that the Dukes would not ever stand for being ""cheated"" and neither should we. Before you purchase this product, here is something you need to know. It is CHEAPER to purchase Seasons 1-7 INDEPENDENTLY rather than this set. The price for Seasons 1-7 independently is $111.93...compared to the price of $203.99 for this set...that's a difference of $92.06! Check it out for yourself, do the math, and save some money for the same product! Keep between the ditches!!"
4,Great trash can for the price,The second one I've purchased. Wish they didn't use so much glue on the front label. A real chore to remove.
3,STICKY LABEL,Over all I do like the function of the trash can. It is a nice quality and size and I really like the clip that holds the bag. The lid will stay up easy when I need it to and shut just as easily. The label was exceptionally sticky and I could not get all of the glue off of the trash can. I am very upset that it looks nasty where the label was. This can was not cheap!
1,"Arrived broken- buy instead from Bed, Bath & Beyond with 20% coupon","My shipment arrived quickly, but after I put the pedal on and then tried to attach the lid, I realized that a piece of the lid had been broken in shipment (the part where the lid attaches to the body of the trashcan) and therefore the lid would not stay on. I returned mine and reccommend if you live close to a Linens 'n Things or Bed, Bath and Beyond (they both carry this exact trashcan for the same price as amazon) that you pick one up there using the 20% coupons the stores mail out."
4,Good Trash Can - Lousy Sticker,"I just bought this trash can to replace an old one. It was easy to assemble and works really well. The only complaint I have is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove the sticker. Unfortunately, they put the huge sticker right on the front of the trash can. Bottom line: Nice product, lousy sticker."
3,They should have let Travis Meeks do the whole thing!,"This cd is pretty much a mixed bag. There are the interesting ""new"" songs, the horrendous covers by Creed, Aerosmith, and Train, and the convincing tracks by STP, Oleander, and the Cult. But as a Doors Purist, Travis Meeks of Days of the New really knows how to handle the difficult task of covering the Doors. His fearless cover of ""The End"" stays true to the original, yet he adds new elements that upstage even Jim Morrison himself! If Travis had done the whole thing, this CD would easily be 5 stars."
1,Worst Album Ever,"I personally concider The Doors to be the greatest rock band ever so I felt obligated to listen to this tribute album. Much to my horor I made the discovery that it is terrible. I can't understand the concept of a tribrte album to begin with. How are you paying tribute to a band by redoing all their songs? Maby it is so you get a real appreation for how good the original is. For this reason I can almost never concider a tribrte album good, but this one is bad even as tribute albums go. There can never be a replacement for Jim Morrison, especially not that idiot form Creed. He completly masacured some Doors hits. The part of this album I hate most is that The Doors actually played on it which means they were concenting to having their music ruined. What were they thinking?"
5,Baseball has never seen the likes of Cam before!,"You have to love Cam Jansen. When you're a kid, you read all of these stories about magic powers, mystery, and adventure. But everyone tells you magic can't exist. Cam Jansen manages to solve every case without the use of magic... she's a real girl. That's what makes her special and what makes you want to red more and more. Cam Jansen is a real kid superhero, and the thought that a person like her could actually exist... makes her the best kid detective ever! Our family loves Cam Jansen!"
5,Great Product,Bought this for my husband to go along with the Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. It works great and he does not have any problems with it.
4,"Simple, well made","Fits my SB-600 like a glove; likely to become a permanent resident of my camera bagUpdate: As predicted, permanent resident of my camera bag. The omni-bounce is invaluable, and way easier to use than a bounce card."
4,Does the Job,"Can't give a 5 star rating on a 16$ piece of plastic... it does work very well though. The price is the only thing that brings this down, and I am far from cheap."
4,Great Diffuser,I picked this up after hearing a friend rave about it. I can say that the Omni Bounce is a great addition to the camera bag. I keep it attached to my sb-600 all the time. It puts out a softer light especially when angled at 45+ degrees. I'd recommend this to any photographer using an external flash.
4,Not what I was looking for,This was a nice CD but it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a choir singing. I wanted an individual. It would be fine for anyone wanting a choir. I did think it was a little hard to understand at times. Like maybe it wasn't clear or the audio wasn't balanced right.
5,The best way to let your mind go!,This is the only rpg Ive seen that anyone can master in one or two tries. Your dreams to be bugs bunny or Daffy come true in this classic rpg. A must buy!
3,Tan Tao liang first movie?,"A very old cheap movie. I think this is the first tan tao liang movie. The coreography is not that good, and the only reason to see this movie is to seeing Tan kicks that are awesome. I would like that amazon.com bring more Tan Tao Liang movies."
1,What IS this??,"Actually zero would be more appropriate. This is dreadful - stay well clear. It is outdated and much of it seems to have been videod directly from a TV or cinema screen, so the end result is pretty awful, not to say really cheeky. References are made to FUTURE space exploration plans for 1976, so maybe you can guess the age of the material."
5,Funny AND exciting lesbian detective fiction - Great Stuff!,"The first Alison Kaine novel and first novel written by Kate Allen that I read. I orginally gave this as a birthday present but then 'retrieved' it to read myself. Unfortunately I never returned it and this is now a book that I have read at least 5 times!That is what makes it such good detective fiction - when you know who has done it and why, yet it still makes for great reading. The reason for this is that the characters are credible, funny and I would like them to be my friends as well. Every lesbian knows an Alison, a Michelle, a Janka and would like to know a Stacey! The gay and lesbian community is well described, as is Denver.Murder, quilting, two-stepping, football and an excellent story - what more could you ask for in a dyke detective novel? Let's have lots more!"
2,Volumetrics Book,"First, I must not have noticed, but this was published in 2000--not so important except in the field of nutrition or electronics. It's a very different approach to ""dieting"", & includes lots of starches/carbs? The worst thing is their FoodPyramid: the bottom, largest section is for Bread, Rice & Pasta! (I guess this diet WOULD ""fill you"", but doesn't seemhealthy by most other current methods). It's ""menu PLAN"" basically just lists foods--not daily menus! It has some recipes, but is more info."
2,Hard to read,"I had to force myself to finish reading it. It is not a friendly book and reads like a college course in nutrition. It is badly laid out, the print is small and it is far too big. A much better choice on the same subject is ""Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss"". It is very inviting, easy and pleasant to read."
5,enjoyable reading,"this book has gotten my lover to reading more book aboutlesbian, romance, mysteries the writer knows how to keepyou on the end of your seat looking foward to more work'sby Laura DeHeart Youngthank you"
3,grisly and fascinating,"This book by a former Beefeater at the Tower is a good introduction to what happened in the danker regions of the Tower. Suffice it to say that today's criminals should thank their lucky stars that times have changed.Some of the tortures will make your skin tingle, but they are all told with a measured British voice. A pleasant and informative book."
1,"Tough life, bad writing","Yeah, life was sure hard, harder than for most, but that's not sufficient to make for valuable reading. This book is heavily plugged on the internet and not worth the bandwidth it takes or the paper it wastes."
3,OK for the price,"The wall charger stopped working a few weeks after I received it, but I was able to send it back and the seller sent a replacement. The battery, however, does not seem to be much of an improvement to what I had previously. It will still only hold a charge about 24 hours, which means I have to charge it almost every night."
1,Might be a good anchor for my boat,"I bought the 1100VA about 10 months ago. About 6 months of supporting my server, I kept finding my server and UPS shut down for reason I could find.None of the other UPS units (APC) reported any power outages.It kept shtting down after shorter and shorter times in operation.Now, even with a very light load, if I unplug incoming power, it shuts off.I went to the Belkin website to see about a replacement under the warraty, but all they said that the 1100VA is no loger available.No recorse and no recommendations.I thought I was buying a quality product.I will not be inclined to buy another Belkin UPS and I can't recommend that anone else should."
1,"DOA unit, returning it to exchange for an APC Back-UPS XS.","I purchased this UPS yesterday from CompUSA, and the unit was DOA right out of the box. I'm returning it to exchange it for an APC Back-UPS XS 900VA."
3,Trouble...,"I loved the looks and the sound of this fountain when it worked. My only initial complaint was that it does not come with an on/off switch. However, it had lots of issues during its short lifespan. The light bulbs kept burning out (and they are expensive to replace). The pump clogged a bit too often (and is a hassle to remove and clean). Finally, after a year, the fountain started leaking from the slate sides, a little at first, but then it basically split vertically beyond repair. For replacement, I went with a completely different concept because I don't want to deal with the same issues again."
1,no stars,"This may be Maria Callas in her prime. But when you have no voice, your prime is still nothing."
4,Still worthwhile as supplement to newer texts...,"Pithy prose with an interesting scoop on the historical development of chemical principles. Hoary for a science text (last published >20 years ago) but the general matter holds true. Well-written and approachable, it makes a good supplement to the dry, long-winded presentations of many a modern introductory chemistry text."
5,"Exact replacement, works great","This is an exact OEM replacement, the only difference is the original remote was seamless, this remote there is a slight gap between the two pieces of the remote. the reason it still gets 5 stars when there is a draw back, is because there is a pro, it comes with a battery.... Heck even the remote from the dealership doesn't come with a battery... easy to follow instructions come with the remote. Good packaging, fast shipment"
4,"Loved the lyrics, music and vibe of the whole CD","Many different styles of music on the CD, but one voice throughout. It makes a difference when artist write and sing about what they know and it shows on this CD. I enjoyed every song, but by far my favorite is ""Redeemer""."
4,Not as good as the first,"This set (as well as the 2nd) cut out a lot of my favorite characters from the 1st season, and has replaced them with characters who make their mark with unsubtle toilet humor. Vicki manages to be in all the sets, though I don't think she's nearly as good as some of the earlier characters. Fortunately, I enjoy David and Matt's performances enough to keep watching. They are wonderful actors.Shipping was speedy as well."
1,Sketch material still funny...if you can view it.,"Sure, not as great as the first two seasons,but it's still very funny. Our set however has worked only once in the lst four attempts to play the discs. Otherwise both discs get locked in the menus and jack happens. So as a usable product our's at least is just one viewing's worth above useless."
1,More of the same,"Honestly, these guys were funny two series ago. They bring back some of the old characters (Emily Howard, Andy, the Fat fighters and Vicky Pollard) that wre funny then. I just didn't feel it with the new characters. And the old ones are getting tired. More of the same I suppose. Instead check out Extras, the new Ricky Gervais series, or the League of Gentlemen, for a dark treat."
5,Treasure to be savoured and used in meditation,"Each chapter in this work provides enough material for reflection to fill a month - and, perhaps, that is the way to enjoy it fully. Father Rahner's sermons on prayer, especially deep and poignant because they were originally delivered to Germans suffering the pain and deprivation following the second world war, are exquisitely beautiful. He writes movingly of how God strips aways our false ways, how the Holy Spirit and Christ within us ""pray for us"" when our own efforts are weak, and far more. Much of it may be difficult to ponder, but the ring of truth and love are so clear that the light of resurrection shows the cross to be a shadow. Superb work to be read at any time, but particularly when one is struggling in one's own prayer life. Those who are familiar with this brilliant Jesuit through his systematic theology will see that the picture is incomplete without observing what a great man of prayer he was."
4,"HDTV Yes, HD-DVD No, 120-240v","Awesome in that every outlet in my house measures full speed. Fast enough to play flawless HDTV (via HDHomeRun device). Rated for operation using 120 and 240 volts. Most people can stop reading here.Unfortunately, continuous stutter playing back HD-DVDs so still needs to be faster for this application. I've solved this need by using a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router which provides great coverage (latest firmware) and speed.Update 13-Oct-2007: Beware noisy devices. They can reduced bandwidth and greatly increase latency. Found a DC adapter that apparently throws off electrical noise. I unplugged it from the same socket as the Panasonic device and, as the manual seems to suggest, put it into a surge protector. That seemed to help throughput. I then cascaded another surge protector in series and that seemed to help more."
4,Works as advertised and at a great price,"My son's wireless Xbox adapter (P.O.S. like most Microsoft crap) couldn't get a signal in our basement in spite of the fact that every other wireless device I have can. So I tried Panasonic's PLC adaptor. I followed the easy instructions and it worked right out of the box with no more fussing around. The signal was adequate for our purposes. I had hoped it would have shown a somewhat higher higher speed than it did, but it was good enough. Also, we have a lot of things on our power lines that they say might interfere with signal integrity and the signal had to reach almost as far as is possible in our house. So, I'd definitely buy this again and if I need internet elsewhere in the house this is what I'd choose."
5,Great option to avoid wireless!,"This is a great product. I used this product to connect two offices. In the past, I had no way to share networked printers between offices, this kit was a ""plug in and go"" setup. This technology has a few advantages over the alternative, which would be to use wireless.1. You can use a hub on each end and connect multiple devices in each location using just a pair of these.2. When you boot your computer up, you don't have to wait for it to associate to your wireless router.3. It works when wireless doesn't (through thick walls, etc).Overall, it's been a great experience and I recommend them."
4,Easy Home Network Connection,"I needed to connect a home computer that is located in a space ""behind"" a refrigerator--wireless (b/g, n) just won't go there through all that metal. These modules work well, with no real setup required. Connection speed is adequate for almost all uses except some high-bandwidth video. And the cost was well below alternatives. The connection does drop out occasionally, most likely due to interference from something else in the wiring, but my previous attempt with another manufacturer's modules wouldn't connect at all. Four stars only because of the occasional drop-outs."
2,Dawn Encounter,"Caid O'Neill simply wanted to avenge his sister's death when he killed Eugune Moisant. Yet, he did more, freeing Eugene's wife, Lisette, from a loveless marriage. However, Lisette's quite mad father-in-law blames her for the young man's death, thinking had she been a better wife, his son would have not sought a mistress. Furthermore, she failed to give him an heir and will not let the old man have her fortune. So, knowing she's in danger, she asks for Cade's protection. He is not a suitable man to love, but as the danger draws nearer, and she continues to display a defiant spirit that refuses to be constrained, Cade comes to love her and he is the only man she can think of.** The plot seems a bit top-heavy, with much extraneous baggage weighing it down. Perhaps it adds color for some, but it bogged down the plot for me. However, Ms. Blake's legion of fans will like as not enjoy this latest entry. **Amanda Killgore"
2,CA speakers,"I bought these speakers for a christmas gift for my sister,s iPod and portable CD player. The speakers worked good until now. There is a buzzing noise and they won't play anything from the iPod. The sound quality was not that great either. A big lack of bass. I would recommend the 2.1 speakers with a sub. They would sound a lot better and last longer."
3,Very good customer service when speaker system stopped working after only 4 months,"We purchased these speakers in July 2010 and used them two (2) times. When we tried to use them again in November 2010 they would not turn on: either the power supply was defective or the power circuit in the speakers was defective. Because this product claims a one year limited warranty and it did not even last beyond 1/3 of that time frame, I called the manufacturer's number as listed with the packaging. The manufacturer's representative was VERY helpful and shipped out a replacement promptly. Upon receiving the new speaker system, testing showed that it was the power supply that failed with the original system, not the speakers themselves. It's hard to judge the quality of the entire system because the speakers work fine, but one power supply failed after only two uses."
3,PRODUCT ORDERED IS NOT PRODUCT RECEIVED,"I hope this is an error and not a case of false advertisement, the product received is not the product ordered. The product received is advertised for less money $11.84 being ca-2014, the product that I ordered is CA-2014rb supposed to be 4 Watts as indicated on my order. Please send my product as ordered, I expect my speakers to be not less than the 4 watts. This was sold to me by AMAZON LLCAmazon LLC, continues to ignore my email messages, which continues to anger me!!! Therfore it is clear to me that the misrepresent their items and hope to get away it. FALSE ADVERTISING."
1,Not like Amazon at all,"No box for the tub of the wheelbarrow, no assembly instructions, the handles taped together, the tub beat up - scratched, dented, chipped. Who knows if it works ok - heck of a Christmas present in this condition!This shipped from Amazon returns - I wonder how many times it was shipped to different locations.Very disappointed. I will have to look at the picture of the item to figure out where wome of the peice go. I was hoping to not have such a challenge during the assembly process."
5,"Great for the non-electronics folks, too",I have Forrest Mims Engineer's Notebook 1979 and Engineer's Notebook II 1982 from Archer(Radio Shack). They have enabled me to learn enough electronics (I am more mechanically oriented) for a career in particle accelerators that is nearing 30 years. I still recommend these books to new engineers that are more mechanically oriented. Great basics. So many of the simple circuits shown here are used as building blocks for much more complex circuitry on our equipment.
4,Another Metal DVD....Another Defect!!!,"I can only give 4 stars to this DVD just from the descriptions of the videos. I havent actually SEEN the DVD yet, because the advanced copy I bought has a defect! (Apparantly, the other reviewers ALSO have advance copies, as this DVD has not been officially released yet.) When the opening video Peace Sells starts, the DVD freezes about a minute in, (right around when Mustaine shows on camera) and my DVD player shuts off! (I own over 50 concert dvds and THEY play fine, so it cant be the DVD player)So be warned!!! Much like the eagerly awaited Iron Maiden DVD, early runs of this may have defects. Anyone else from the NY area have this problem? Please sound off here! I want to find out if this defect was something specific to the dvd, or the area where I purchased it. Thanks."
3,Choose Wisely,"Purchased this set to aid in the removal and installation of a transmission in my small pickup. Used the 18"" extension almost exclusively. Bar did fine in removal of bolts that were obviously not torqued to spec, however when used to torque the bolts (60 ft/Lbs) during reassembly, the bar twisted and ultimately broke on the socket end twisting the square drive off in the socket. Most 3/8"" drive torque wrenches routinely go up to 80 to 100 Ft/Lbs so I assumed that 60 Ft/Lbs would not be too much for a 3/8"" drive extension to handle. Price was only about $20.00, so I guess I got what I paid for. Next time I'll go with a 1/2"" drive and a better quality. Choose wisely for your application."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,The art work is horrendous! If Dion were here today she would sue! However if you are a collector of Tarot card you should buy it as I am sure it will be off the market soon. This is truly an AWFUL deck! If there had been a no star rating I would have given it NO STARS.
1,Disappointment!,"I'm a BIG fan of Don Henley and The Eagles, but this is a BIG Disappointment. He is reaching with the material and delivery.Back to the drawing board....You can't always score a gold medal."
2,Not as good as he has been,"Henleys new offering of a stunning 13 tracks(most over 5 minutes)has taken him 11 years to complete and compared with other albums in his catalogue,it is rather a disappointment.There are no catchy tunes like ""Boys of summer"" or ""the heart of the matter"",only ""Taking you home""and ""They are not here ,They are not coming ""match his own standards.Maybe 10 fully realised songs would have made a better choice.So let's wait the next 10 years for more satisfying work of this former gifted songwriter."
4,Vintage Henley,"Compared with earlier works like *I Can't Stand Still* and *Building the Perfect Beast*, *Inside Job* is a bit disappointing, but not a total surprise, either. One would expect Henley to dilate on the simple things like marriage and relationships after his own wedding, the births of his children and the Eagles reunion. Still, as a lyricist, Henley is quite rusty and even lazy at times--the biting lyrics that used to emulate Randy Newman and Leonard Cohen are predictable, slight and silly this time--especially on ""Workin' It"" and the pointless ""Nobody Else in the World..."" (just who does he think he's satirizing?).But you gain some things and lose some things with age, and Henley's apparent ""less is more"" approach on songs like ""Taking You Home"" and ""My Thanksgiving"" works well for him--they may not appeal to the Britney/Backstreet crowd, but that only makes me grateful to still have Henley around. Great production by Stan Lynch as well."
2,Disappointed,Only liked a couple of the cuts. Much of the CD is interspersed with strange sounds and excessive philosophy. There are plenty of funk/rap CDs for that venue. Seems that Henley wants to deny his age and heritage. Too bad...neither worth the wait nor the money.
1,This is not what I was waiting for,"I own everything don henley has recorded. This album is so bad that I may not buy whatever comes next. There is not one good song on it. I repeat-- for those of you who are fans of the lyricism and the blue eyed soul that Henley does so well here is some advice. Pretend you are still waiting for a new don henley album, because you are. This work is sophmoric and over-produced. Henley's voice is lost among a cluster of back-up singers. ""Taking You Home""-- you will soon hear this song everywhere, because it could just as easily have been recorded by Celine Dion. If that's your thing then great. But Henley has talent and this album wastes it."
1,Disappointing and a waste of investment,Had very high hopes tied to this album of don's and sad to say that it sounded like a dance re-mix album with practically no direction and sleek guitar work . Even the drums sounded electronic . Hard to jadge a cd by it's artis and cover these days . Hope i could trade this cd for the the new eric clapton / bb king one
2,Disappointing,There is little creativity or passion from a performer who has both. This is not up to his standards.
3,not loud enough,I think these would be great if only the alarm was louder. I am sure I wouldn't hear it if I was upstairs and especially not if I was sleeping.
2,Get What You Pay For,The colors are bright and it came timely. However after two good wind storms it shreaded to pieces. You have to know for the price it is practically disposable...buy a couple just in case.
2,Misleading description.,Product advertised as fitting a DLC-10 series processor. Product in the bag actually fit a DLC-7 according to the text on the part itself. Returned the product for a complete refund.
4,Good mix of Country and Alternative,When I hear this album I can't help but think a little of REM in their early days--when they were still good.
5,....slump business...,"...most combos of jazz and hip hop fall way too short of expectations, it's too much of one and not enough of the other.dj cam's 'mad, blunted jazz' probably is the best cd out there to really fuse both together and create something truly original....this album runs a close second, but it's not really jazz music so much as it is rap instrumentals played with jazz instruments.it's smooth jazz with a kick! excellent music to sit back and slump to; conversate with a friend/politic with a partna/spit game to co-ed over this...play this for any occassion and enjoy."
4,Choral Conductiong- a how to,"Guy B. Webb compiled some of the great choral conductors of our time to write essays on practical up to the minute information on what is going on now and how to be the best choral conductor you can be. Authors include Robinson, Sharp, Paine, O'Neal, Marvin, Neuen, Brandvik, cox, Jordan, Webb, Kolb, and Dorsey. A definite must for all students and conductors of all skill levels."
1,"Why, Why?","Bye-Bye by Jane Reavill Ransom is a novel that can actually be turned into a recipe: Simply toss a salmon steak into the food processor along with some peppermint candies, add some frozen peas and a good portion of chocolate syrup, then blend at high speed.The resulting mess is the dish I call ""Bye - Bye""As brief as this ""novel"" is, I didn't even finish it. This book is a complete zero."
2,GAY PORN???,DISSAPOINTED... iT WAS GOOD BUT NOT XACTLY WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR. I DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO READ THROUGH ENTIRE MOVIE THE GUYS WERE GOOD LOOKING THOUGH...Mike Berry
2,unhappy with spice,the couscous spice was not the same flavor as the spice purchased at the spice market in Paris. I miss that wonderful flavor.
2,misleading photo,the photo for this spice is very misleading. Only about 8 teaspoons of spice in thispackage. Price is too high for the amount.
5,The dream must go on.,The last box set was a shock.This disk make us feel that Melies's dream is not over still more.
3,CHRITMAS GIFT,"I gave it as a Christmas gift, they were playing with it whenI gave it t the person so I guess it was good"
4,It's was fun silly gift.,What can be more fun than a flying screaming monkey? I don't know. I sent it to my college student to make him smile and it worked.
5,Fun Monkey,"Fun for all ages above 6. Actually, if it were up to me I'd make it fun for ages 10 and up, because younger kids could easily hurt themselves or others with it. I love the monkey, don't get me wrong. They just need to keep it out of young kids hands."
3,OXO cheese grater,This grater is pretty great! the detachable container that snaps onto it's base is a pretty nice addition. The container has a cover that you can snap onto it to store what you dont use. I like this grater but it feels a bit flimsy. I have come to expect high quality sturdy and durable items from OXO and this grater just doesnt feel as quality as the rest. Aside from that it does it's function and has remained shard through countless uses.
2,Handle broke off,Simple enough design and did the job well ... until handle broke off and rendered useless. Big fan of OXO but would not purchase this product again.
2,Downgraded by Cooks Illustrated / America's test Kitchen.,"I don't have one of these, so I cannot personally comment, but this recently grater was downgraded by Cook's Illustration / America's Test Kitchen. It dropped from one of the best to 'Not Recommended' in the May/June 2012 magazine. The reason why is that OXO redesigned the grating surface such that it grates on both the down and up strokes. Apparently this impacted grating quality and left this grater very difficult to clean."
3,"Was hoping for more, just ok...","I like OXO products generally, from ok to nice to look at, usually have a solid feel and very nice ergonimically. This grater makes no improvements in ergonomics outside of the plastic handle vs. some uncomfortable metal handles. The catch-cup is nice. It cuts just ok, not amazing as some reviews stated. My big complaint is that while it looks a bit nicer than my old chefmate (very cheap grater), it cuts the same and it actually feels flimsier (The steel body has some bend while grating) even my chefmate didn't do that. Wish I had chosen a different upgrade, the search continues for a better grater, $15 down the road..."
3,Good choice,"This happens to be the best box grater I have seen,like all graters you have to be careful to keep from loosing some skin."
3,sharp but the handle is weak,"good sharp grater, better than the others i have at home. too bad that the plastic handle got disconnected on one side pretty fast. it's still usable, but not so comfortable any more.PS: I've owned it for a while now. It's not any more as sharp as it used to be. I recently purchased a Microplane box grater. It is definitely of superior quality (and more pricey), though the shapes of the grates are somewhat non-standard. If you are looking for a new grater, check that one too, there are plenty informative reviews (including mine), and may be you will find that it has the features you are looking for."
2,Not for Advanced Studies,"This book reads well, but is only good as a very general overview of the subject. Don't buy this book if you are needing a supplement for a college level course, it does not go into enough detail."
5,Wonderful Music,"This CD features music by a most talented musician. Nibley is easy to listen to. Very soothing, relaxing and inspiring music."
4,Pretty Good Book,This book is pretty good. I bought it mainly for one song (Love Changes Everything). The songs aren't too difficult to play if you know what they are and how they are supposed to sound.
4,A long overdue expose' of African kleptocracies...,"...and a much-needed counterblast to their towel boys in TransAfrica, The Nation of Islam, and too many American universities. The book is a litany of outrages, failures, and incompentence, linked together by the author's exposition of Africa's pre- and post-colonial history and economics. His picture of pre-colonial democratic Africa may be too rosy--the baroque cruelties reported by early European explorers do not figure here--but any surviving shred of tradition has to be better than the ""vampire state"" that most sub-Saharan Africans are saddled with now. The litany of horrors tends to get numbing after a while, but that's scarcely the author's fault. Blame the Western press and intellectuals for their silence, and Western aid, which helped prop up these terror-regimes for so long.I resubmit this review, to link with my current list."
1,WORST tape that I have ever tried to use!,The review of this product sounded great so I thought that I would give it a try ... IT'S HORRIBLE! The tape keeps falling back on the roll so you spend half your time try to find where the tape was cut off and then trying to get it started again. I should have ordered Scotch brand.
3,Puzzles started out easy but ...,"The puzzles from the middle to the end of the game were difficult. On a scale of 1 to 5, as an adventure gamer I am probably a 3, but I hit the wall enough times with this game that I had to get outside help --- I had no idea, even with the in-game hints, how to make gun powder or acid with my inventory items! I did enjoy the game, but the frustration factor was high for me.But even with the need for help, overall I must say I enjoyed the game. I just didn't enjoy the parts where I was banging my forehead on the keyboard when I could not figure out what to do next."
4,Really fun game,I liked this game a lot. It was fun to find and combine inventory items to make new items. The game was easy enough to play and the puzzles related to the game and were fun. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was just too short. I finished the game in about 6 hours. I would have liked to have had another 10+ hours of game play. The graphics are great and the story is really fun.
5,One very hot single,"Nas is back... After dropping his ""Illmatic 10th anniversary"" album, Nas comes outta nowhere and drops his new single, ""Thief's Theme"". And let me tell you, it's hot. The beat kicks in with a blaring guitar riff, and Nas comes hard with a chorus that you may recognize from his '94 classic, ""The World is Yours"". Nas is one of the best lyrisists of all time, and he shows it in ""Thief's Theme"", along with some signature Nas flows. The best part is, he still has it, after 10 years in the rap game, he's still able to maintain the lyrical prowess that made him great. ""Thief's Theme"" could've been longer, but there's nothing wrong with short and sweet. Can't wait 'till the new album drops."
1,ahhh!,im trying to build a arcade cabinet right. i get it set up where i want it and went at it. about 4 feet of routing the cutting tips of the blade came off. oh and shipping was off by a few days also.
4,Stellar Melodies,"They say that imitation is the best form of flattery, but sometimes placing your own spin on a style/sound can actually create something more creative and unique. Lupine Howl jumps on Spritualized's earlier spacey albums, eg, Laser Guided Melodies, and adds twists of funk, rock, and psychadelia. Perhaps this is the path Spiritualized would've taken if they didn't go up the symphonic epic and gospel choir route. Lupine Howl still retains alot of the essence of early Spiritualized, yet has more diversity and scope. Spiritualized is about travelling through space; Lupine Howl also takes a similar route, yet changes it's musical course at every planetary stop."
3,Exfoliating milk cleanser,This product is mild & easy to use. My friend swears by it. I prefer Dr. Wexler's exfoliating scrub (purchased at Bath & Bodyworks)
2,"Yikes, what a strange sound...","I bought this album a few years ago hoping to find some gentle background music to play during the Christmas season. What I got was an album that my wife and I refer to as ""the ugly Christmas music."" It is very gentle, and it is nothing more than an acoustic guitar. But the guitar player does the strangest things as he plays the melodies of these songs, slipping and sliding all over the notes. This offers a strange amalgam of country/bluegrass sounds with Indian/Asian sounds, and it sounds just dreadful. There are a few tracks at the end with less sliding around the notes, which kept this from being a 1-star review, but we really dislike this album. I guess there are folks out there who like whatever musical style this is, but I don't know who they are, so I'm not sure I can recommend ""Simplicity Christmas: Guitar"" to anyone!!"
1,Flokati Rug - too much maintenance,"I did not know that this rug was the tangled mess of a sheep. There is no way that i would have the time or desire to ""comb"" out this mess - ever. I wish the picture would have been CLOSER UP that i could have seen what it was. I thought I was ordering a shaggy rug of some kind."
1,Water and Detergent leak all over the place.,"Don't buy it! My unit leaks both water and detergent all over the place. I've only used it 5 times, but it is out of warranty. I think this product is defective and there are many other people out there with the same problem."
1,Cliched Trail Ride,"After years of being a faithful Rogers fan, I am finally going to call it quits. It's hard to believe that Ms. Rogers wrote this book. The characters were flat in this one. The plot meandered everywhere. It was just another cliche-riddled trail ride. I can't recommend it. Better to go back and read the Steve and Ginny stories which are still wonderful to read!"
5,A Most Fantastic Selection of Music,"I bought this album in England and listened to it as my dance album of choice for two years. When it was stolen from my car, I actually cried, thinking I could never get it again. Then, I found it here, and I almost cried again. It is GREAT!"
2,"Cheaply Made, but cute!","This shelf isnt exactly what I would call great quality, but if you can get it with out having any nicks or dings in it like I did, and put it together correctly, Then it will make a great addition to your La Petite Room"
3,Do Not Buy This Album!!,"I don't have this album per se, but I do have History of Rock which includes a good bit of the songs that are on this album, so if you want a taste of what Early Mornin' Stone Pimp sounded like, grab that CD. Do not pay this weasel the near $300 he wants for this used (and probably worn) CD. Trust me folks, it's not worth it, especially with it being in used condition. With the way the Internet has evolved over the past several years, and the evolution of music websites, I'm sure one can find this album for download for free or at one-tenth (or less) the price this guy is asking for this CD. Seriously folks, spend your money wisely."
1,Wrong CD,I PReviously said that I have this CD & would burn it for a quarter of the price. The CD I have is not the same as this so please retract my last comment. Thank You
5,the great russ columbo,russ columbo was considered the first and finest croner of his time-the 30 and 40s---many considered him better croner then bing crosby-jerry vale revives his memory but falls short in style and voice and croning delivery- not his fault russ columbo was the best but imitation is flatery--give gerry A for effort and A for remembering russ and reminding us that you cant imitate the best-sometimes it doent come off---i would have preferred a release of a russ colombo album
2,so small!!!,"WARNING!These are not mixing bowls. They are PREP bowls.Maybe I am silly for not being able to distinguish the difference on the web, but I thought I was getting mixing bowls.When they arrived I was shocked to find tiny little bowls that could hold maybe one egg or 3 Tablespoons of sugar.Just a warning for those who are confused like me!"
1,Very small bowls,"I returned this item because they were very small bowls. I thought that they are different in size and bigger, but the once that I received were very very small and were not what I was looking for."
3,not so good,"this book was ok, but it didn't really help me at all. I took a sample SAT and after I worked through the entire book, my score still didn't change at all. This book gives you a lot of detail about what the PSAT and SAT are like, and also a vocabulary list and lots of practice questions. It'll probably be good just to work through anyway before the SATs. The wording in the book was good and easy to understand."
5,Concealed Carry,"This book should be a MUST read for anyone even considering getting a gun for self-defense regardless if you want to conceal carry, open carry or just have the firearm in the house for personal/family protection. Very well written useful information can be gathered from the true stories. We hear a lot about learning from other peoples mistakes and experiences, this is another way to do just that."
