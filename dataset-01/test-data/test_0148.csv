4,Great fun from Steve Alten,"Steve Alten writes good books with original ideas which are full of action, thrills and are simply enjoyable to read. This is another one of those: it involes an ancient enigma, secretly written in the Mayan calendar which predicts the end of the world unless it can be solved and somehow prevented. The main characters: psychologist Dominique Vazquez and a high-IQ son of a former archeologist Mick Gabriel are a great team and together they search for answers to solve this ancient riddle. Pure fun, mystery, prophecies and action."
4,Better Than Meg,"It's nice to see that Alten's writing skills have improved. I read ""Meg"" and felt it to be a mediocre book, simply written and cliched in plot and dialogue. It's the main reason I skipped ""The Trench."" ""Domain"" shows greatly improved writing, characters with depth and a plot that, although a bit out of this world, satisfies. The combination of genres including aliens, South American myth, and apocalyptic war blend pretty well. I am going to check out more of his books as a result of ""Domain."" I hope that Alten continues to improve. If he does, he will rank up there with Matthew Reilly, James Rollins, and Preston/Child as a writer of great thrillers."
1,Runs very small,I got a 3x & it fit someone that wears a 1x !!Nice jacket - but sizing is way too small !!
1,BACKORDER HELL,I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED A JACKET THAT LOOKED FEMININE AND THEN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL THAT IT WOULD BE HERE IN APRIL DONT SELL IT IF YOU DONT GOT IT OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
2,A Poor Showing: The Fugitive Season 4 Vol. 1,"The seventh release (Autumn 1966) of The Fugitive suffers from the diminished production values of Adrian Samish.The show comes off as a short shrifted version of the then new series 'The Invaders,' another Samish production.Anyone familiar with the earlier 'Outer Limits' will recognise Dominic Frontiere's theme music from thatseries first season (1963) in every episode of 'Fugitive' vol. 7. It's entirely embarresing and a completerip off. I give this vol. 7 two stars at best.Keith Owen"
1,Very disappointing!,"I have purchased sets of DVDs before, and love how they have been packaged. You do not get this with this set. It is also disappointing that the original music has been replaced with music I've never heard before. In the slumber party scene, you see the girls lip syncing to Mony Mony while some strange song plays in the background. In the episode Fire and Ice, when Brandon and be figure skater skate to I've had the Time of My Life, some random, not romantic fast song plays. In the end, I am disappointed that I spent the amount of money to not have the original series, and the music was a big part of the original series."
2,Too Small!,"This thing is well made for what it is, but it is too small! I do not have arms as big as the dude in pic wearing it, and it is too small for me to wear in the position he is wearing it in. It's a shame because it is well made and otherwise a fine product for what it is designed for.Update; Had my wife sew in a small band of velcro where it was lacking for a bigger fit, and couln't be happier with the armband, now that it fits."
4,armband case,The cellet armband case works really good with my cell (about the size of a razr) I also use it with my creative vision M mp3. If you like to just turn on your player and go its a great value but if you like play different songs as you go spend the extra money on the correct case. Great experience will deffinetly buy from them again.
2,I would have given this more stars but Mineko is not a nice person,"I enjoyed the book in general as this subject has always facinated me. Overall it was well written but annoying at the same time. Mineko is not a nice person and is rather discusting. She suckled on her big sisters breast until she was well over 8 years old and was cruel enough to be happy her ""mean""older sister has Alzheimers. Mineko states she is getting what she deserves. It is hard to tell if her sister is really mean as Mineko dislikes just about everyone. Though fictional the heroine in Memoroirs of a Geshia is likeable where Miniko is not. She is conceited, arrogant and at times downright hateful."
3,feels like sugarcoating,"I devoured this book in about 2 days. I read and watched 'Memories of Geisha' and was interested in her side of the story. Personally, it is lots and lots of sugarcoating which I don't think is due to lost in translation. But what I did like is that she uses many Japanese words for particular item or custom and than goes in great detail to explain it. I also liked that she included some of her personal photos. One thing for sure: I am soooo glad that I was not born in old Japan, perhaps I would have been sold into the business or would have been forced to give up my child for life like that. Can not imagine either, particularly later!"
4,useful but doesn't seem very accurate,"This scale is useful, because of it's size and portability, and the price was right, but it doesn't seem very accurate. That shouldn't matter much if always used with the same pet in the same location and manner, to determine if that pet is gaining or losing. It wouldn't necessarily give an accurate ""absolute"" weight that could be compared to the weight of the same pet on other scales, such as at the vet."
4,"You just might win a battle you never fought, just by checking this record you bought.","""Get Up! (Before the Night is Over)"" was a #7 hit for Technotronic back in 1990. It's a fun dance song of the era. I have a different version of the CD single, which features four different mixes of the song."
4,Good standard reference material,"A well written and illustrated textbook on the subject matter. It is exactly what it wants to be: An introduction. And it is a good one. Wide and detailed enough to give the beginner a good handle of ""what optical mineralogy is all about"" without going into too much detail of purely academic issues. Good balance of theory and examples.The illustrations are plenty, rich and very instructive. However, minor improvements may be possible by replacing some of the black&white; illustrations with updated colour graphics, in particular the microphotographs."
3,Singing bank doesn't sing ?,"This musical bank is a great gift overall, but our first one was delivered damaged, wouldn't play music when coins were dropped through the slots. It is usually a very easy fix, the small flap inside that detects the coin entry sometimes falls away from the opening. In this particular case the music device did not work at all. On the up side the manufacturer is very supportive and immediately sent out a replacement. I would recommend this purchase for almost anyone looking for a great children's bank. Good support is sometimes worth as much as the product itself!"
1,No help to a grower.,"I've read a lot of marijuana grow books and this has to be the worst I've ever read. I even find it hard to believe that this comes from the great writer Ed Rosenthal, for years I'd followed his articles and columns with wonder at the endless supply of knowledge he posses, but this book doesn't even give you enough informnation to grow one plant! For anyone that wants to learn how to grow, either on a small scale or large I'd recommend Marijuana Grower's Guide by Mel Frank or Marijuana Grower's Handbook by Ed Rosenthal. These books may be older and not as flashy as this but they contain everything any grower would ever need to know."
3,Writings By Inmates,"Edited by Frank Earl Andrews and released in 1976, this is a book of writings by various prison inmates. It is most significant because it contains rare material by two of Charles Manson's followers: Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten. The two contributed poems, short stories and drawings. I haven't read it in years, but do recall finding it interesting at the time."
5,Excellent piece of Circulon,"This is a wonderful Circulon piece that can be used for so many things. It's the perfect size for a variety of purposes. I use it to make anything from gilled cheese to alfredo sauce to frittatas to fried chicken. I steam veggies in it too. It's a very versatile piece. This is one of those pieces that I would recommend for anyone who wants to try Circulon for the first time, as well as the serious cook who is looking for great quality anodized cookware. I love Circulon and have been using it for years. The high low finish makes it easy to clean and I am particularly enthralled with the glass lids for the newer styles like this one."
4,Improved cooking safety,A great improvement over 'large saucepans'. For those of us in the senior years the added safety of two handles greatly reduces accident potential. Have found this produce equally at home on stove top or oven.
2,"Not work $90, would not pay more than $25","This is a very thin light weight pan, not at all the quality of a pan that retails for $90.Seems to me they cut costs big time to produce this pan then marked it way up expecting the Circulon name would sell this product. I would not pay any more than $25 including shipping for this product."
1,Thermostat doesn't work,"I put this heater into a very cold bedroom and had to keep ""upping"" the thermostat to the highest (80) before it came on continuously and it clicked off while the room was still cool-ish.If you don't care about a thermostat, and just want it either on or off, you'll love this heater! It's super quiet and nice looking. Frankly, I hate to return it, but I bought it with the thought of it being on while sleeping and keeping the room at a certain temp. For that, the thermostat needs to work properly."
2,Blew out our electric power,"This heater on first appearance was well-made. It was remarkably quiet. That being said we had to return it.It consistently blew our electric circuits. Even when we tried putting it on the lowest temperature, it still drew too much power.Not sure why this was happening but felt compelled to return the heater and buy another brand."
1,better off spending a little more...,"I bought a Vornado heater and was very happy with it. I wanted another one and should have stuck with a sure thing. Instead I let the lower price of the Holmes lure me in. Not the same. :( It's true, you get what you pay for. If you must buy the cheaper heater, go to Target and get 30% off all their heaters now at least. I just saw this heater for $25 at Target. I'm going back to Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon and buying another Vornado. Their coupons never expire by the way even though they have an expiration date."
5,great price,I use this as an insulin spike for my creatine and post workout protein/carb mix. I haven't had DOMS in over a year while following a 2:1 or 4:1 carb protein mix using this.
4,"Animal, children paintings",I love the book with its whole emphasis on the Edwardian and Victorian paintings by Mr. Elsley. Why I didn't give it 5 stars was the limited amount of full color reproductions. These painting need to be shown in color. Black and white just doesn't do them justice!
2,Useless,"I took the sheriff test,and the book I bought has nothing to do with the test!! The only thing that came in handy was the vocabulary words that I learned. I would not recommend this book. Best to buy a reading comprehension book instead."
4,nice,well done. the front of the book has a few smudges but no big deal cuz i got it used. in good shape thanks
5,feels wonderful,"As a baby boomer who is developing those all too familiar aches and pains, this product feels wonderful. It is easy to use on oneself so you don't have to wait for another person to give you a massage for those aching muscles. Highly recommend this product."
2,Plays store bought dvds fine but not anything burned,"This is a nice dvd player as far as the picture and sound goes. It will play store bought dvds fine but anything that was burned on a dvd recorder whether it was a dvd-r or dvd+r, it would freeze and skip and sometimes get confused. This upset me as the box says it will play DVD-r/rw and DVD+r/rw but I never had any luck.I returned this after a week of checking out what dvds would play on it and bought a Panasonic 7 inch DVD-LS50 model that will play anything that I have burned on a dvd recorder as that is what I want to watch on it as well as the store bought dvds."
1,Disappointing,"From the title of this DVD, I was expecting to actually see 'LIVE' singing. It is nothing but still photos with infomation regarding each of the 3 Tenors. They do nothing together. Of course, the music is beautiful but that can be heard on CDs. I was extremely disappointed!!"
5,DARK CREEPY DRAMA...BETTER THAN X FILES,"Having moved from Washington D.C. to Seattle to excape the terror he has dealt with as a F.B.I. profiler, Frank Black (played to perfection by Lance Henriksen),runs head first into more evil and darkness than he could have ever imagined when he joins the Millenium group. Dedicated to fighting the forces of evil, the Millennium group soon finds Frank to be their most valuable asset. With dark, creepy story lines, and plot twists around every corner, season one of MELLENNIUM is a must see for all horror and suspense junkies. Highly recommended.Thanks and enjoy,Tom"
2,Not the patagonia I know,"I have been to Patagonia, and I saw many different things, none of what the author speaks of. This book rambles on with tales, characters are brought up without reference, and stories are randomly inserted that it made very little sense. I finished the book, but not without a struggle."
4,An interesting travel book although it dies at the end.,"While an interesting read, with good research, and a cast of characters who help move the book along, I was disappointed with the ending which just trailed off. It was as though he became bored with the subject. There was no revelation, no feeling that the journey had taught him anything, and no distillation of this great expanse land. I never even knew what he thought about Patagonia by the end of his journey, or if his journey had changed his perceptions. Nevertheless, for someone who is about to live in BA for three years it was a pleasant primer."
2,"Chatwin a colonial, anti-Semitic jerk","I started this book expecting to prefer it to Theroux and, after reading Travels in a Thin Country by Sara Wheeler, looking forward to Chatwin's version of Patagonia. Chatwin's focus is on the colonial families, especially those from the British Isles. He obviously has no sympathy for or interest in Latin residents. And then to top it off he tells of a Mrs. Wood who (gasp) tries to pass herself off as English when she is really a ""Russian Jewess."" Then he follows up with Simon Radowitsky, who ""with the wild hope of his Race"" is irrational. This book was published in 1977, not 1877, but you wouldn't know it from Chatwin's sensitivities. Read Wheeler for a cultured English viewpoint on Chilean Patagonia. And a much more interesting book."
2,a stranger here,"Chatwin never understood Patagonia, moreover he never liked it. I know this because Chatwin himself said so. Anyway, all the wonderful people who lives there and fight their lives over day after day, don't like Chatwin either. So we are even, although Chatwin passed by, and wonderful Patagonia is for ever."
3,Only one steam sterilizer to choose from!,"I bought this product purely because my daughter and grandson were visiting from the UK. I had a lot of trouble finding a steam sterilizer in the major stores where I live. I thought I would be able choose top models from a large selection. This product was the only one I could find anywhere! It does the job adequately but in comparison to the one I bought from huge selection in the UK, this is nowhere near as good quality, not as fast to sterilize (12 minutes versus 6 mins) and not as versatile (1 way to sterilize versus 3).In my opinion this product does well as a basic model.My gripe is that although this product is essential, I could not find more to choose from. This was the only choice on the Amazon site! There must be more...somewhere."
1,stopped working,"I should have read the reviews. I purchased this item, and it quit working after a week of normal use."
2,Poor Item,"The item is very attractive BUT within two of use, the metal base started to rust. I called the company and they were trying to pass it off repeatedly as 'mineral deposits' as if I don't know rust. Anyway I am the point where after minutes of trying to convince them, they agreed for me to return it so we will see. I find this sort of customer service ridiculous!!!"
3,Could have been better,"This album from the legendary rocker Robert Plant is an uneven collection of songs, which still contains some highlights like Another Tribe, The Enchanter, Let The Four Wind Blows and Mighty Rearranger. The rest sounds a bit uninspired and ""far out"" to me. And the backing musicians seems also a bit reserved in their playing. I suspect that Plant is unsure in which musical direction he wants to go. Mighty Rearranger is not a bad record after all, but a little disappointment from such a great musician."
5,Buy it now,This is a great CD. The production is fantastic and songs are clever and entertaining. This is the best effort from Robert Plant in years.
1,YAKEEN = SHATTERED / COMPLETE RIP-OFF OF SHATTERED!,"WOW! I hope Wolfgang Petersen sued Bollywood's ass off for stealing his movie almost verbatim? Shattered happens to be one of my all time favorite movies and, while a modern day remake would be interesting, for Hindi Films to just plagiarize this is beyond comprehension. This movie isn't a slight resemblance to Shattered or a similar tale...IT IS SHATTERED with a different title, different actors in a foreign language! Even the main characters flashbacks to going through the car windshield in the accident throughout as his own memories fight the false ones his deceptive ""wife/mistress"" have fed him conflict all there. When Tom Behrenger's ""Dan Merrick"" came home from the hospital and smashed the mirror in the master bedroom SO DID HIS COUNTERPART IN THIS ONE! Don't waste your money enabling the crooks that stole this great movie!!!!"
3,CD had a scratch down the middle,"Very quick shipping but the CD had a scratch that made it not play correctly on some of my various players, but it did play on the better ones, so I'm not complaining, just alerting the seller to double check products closely."
2,"Warning ""Diatribe"" coming",This book would have been fine had it been published 20 years ago before the saturation of critical theory. Now it just feels like a wounded discourse from someone who went to grad school in the 60's.
5,Herbs For Kids Sweet Echinacea,"Sweet Echinacea is highly tolerable for even the pickiest tastebuds. It boosts the child's immune response and reduces length and severity of illness when given at the first sign of a virus. Great product. I wouldn't be caught without it. When combined with a no-sugar or very low-sugar and non-dairy diet, the illness length and severity is literally cut in half or better."
4,Nice sequel to Darwin's Radio!,"Greg Bear keeps writing books that end up on my list of favorites. Darwin's Radio was brilliant, and Darwin's Children is an excellent sequel. Don't pick this story up in the middle. If you haven't read Darwin's Radio, get that one first -- you won't be sorry. As for this book, Bear does a great job of developing the character of a ""new child,"" the next step in human evolution. I can't comment on how good the science is, since my main knowledge of biology stops with the frog I cut open in high school, but ultimately the characters make this a fine story. He also mixes in some ideas about God, and he does it deftly and gently, without making it seem out of place in a story that deals with evolution.A nice added touch in Darwin's Children is a biology primer at the end of the book, along with a glossary of technical terms. Not enough to get you that job at the CDC, but helpful nonetheless."
2,Read the Caveats first...,"While Bear attempts to justify his bizarre evolution mechanism in the caveats at the end of the book, anyone familiar with the darwinian explanation (eg. have read Dawkins) will find it quite ridiculous. Rather than a story of interesting insight, I found it a wandering and self-serving; more like a bad non-fiction work. Perhaps if he had included even more explanation it would have been more believable. But perhaps that would have just made it worse non-fiction.If you feel you MUST read this book, do youself a favour: read the first chapter or two, then the caveats (they reveal nothing not covered in the first few pages)."
3,What a disappointment&#65533; what a book this could have been,"Why you should read this:Many of the devoted fans of Bear who read with relish Darwin's Radio will eagerly look forward to buying this book. For them, it will be a very quick and, perhaps in some ways, satisfying read. It will answer certain questions about ""what happened next"" and could even leave room for yet a third novel. It is otherwise a harmless novel that will not enlighten but not irritate a reading audience(...)"
5,Beating the Midas Curse,"If you ever wanted your children, grand children, great grandchildren and beyond to understand who you are and what was important to you, than this book is for you. It is amazing to find out that with good estate planning (passing estates with a tax efficient plan), that you have a 90% failure rate by the third generation. This book gives you a step by step approach to a process that will be priceless for every family that cares about their family and their community."
5,Loved it,Saw this on Showtime and loved it. Ross takes us on an amazing tour of behind the scenes Iraq. Would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves comedy regardless of their politics. Nice publicity for the USO.
3,Does the job but not ideal,I like it because it fits in our small sink space (barely) but the toothpaste section is small. I have to squish the bottom of the tube to fit and taking the tube out pulls the top of the holder off. It's a bit annoying but at least we have a toothbrush holder now. It would work best with smaller tubes of toothpaste but we always get 7.8 oz. economy size.
2,"Umbra Orvino Melamine Toothbrush Holder, White, disappointed","This is a disappointment for me, doesn't hold any toothpaste tubes that I purchase. The top is in another drawer, can't put tubes in at all. Just wanted item to store toothpase in plus two brushes. Very pretty to look at and cleans up nice, but what the heck, wanted to store brushes and paste all in one piece, not disassemble and willy-nilly my items...sorry, but not what I really wanted, but keeping on vanity anyway...Thanks Amazon."
1,Horrible Book,"I am Majoring in Business Management/Accounting and this book was required for my intermediate classes. The reason why I say this book is horrible is that it doesnt have a good flow to the learnig objectives. It jumps around and sends the student back and forth throughout the chapter causing a great deal of confusion. There are very few examples, and the calculations are about as clear as mud. The vocabulary used is vague and confusing. I wouldnt reccomend this book even if it were free."
2,Please kill me if I gotta read it again!,"Accounting is a pretty simple subject. This book definitely makes it harder than it seems. When I read other reference books, I understand the material right away, but when I read this book, I get confused. This book is long, boring and overstating a simple topic. When I took this class I had to outline each chapter, OH MY .... IT IS TOO LONG FOR A SIMPLE IMPORTANT IDEA!!!"
1,Poor book,Poor examples. Absolutely no way to check yourself when doing chapter-end questions. Hopefully the new edition improves from this one. Doubt it though.
2,france forbidden,"i cannot buy this item because of geographic retrictions.It is an electronic document, strange ?"
3,Good Corny Sci-Fi,"This is a great cheesy movie. It lags a bit through the middle but provides some good laughs all around if you are interested in bad special effects and silly sci-fi plots. Also, the packaging is one of those thin cardboard sleeves found at Dollar Store DVD selections. Don't expect quality, though it's good for a few cheap laughs.I initially got this DVD because I am a huge Klaus Kinski fan, though it doesn't contain much of that fierce energy found in many of his movies. He's pretty out of his element here in a low point of his career.There are several totally pointless and un-arousing boob shots, cheesy one-liners, and a poor demonstration of camera techniques. I got it for (...) a very reasonable (and justifiably low) price. Well worth it;)"
3,Mindless fun,"If you are in the right frame of mindlessness, ""Creature"" can be an outrageous film. Nobody said this film was blockbuster entertainment, but from the moment Klaus Kinski appears, the film takes an unexpected turn into B sci-fi film hall of fame. The performances are adequate, especially Diane Salinger as Melanie the security officer. The special effects, for its budget, are great. And the creature does make a nightmarish impression. (Yes, I know the creature was featured in director, Bill Malone's earlier flick, ""Scared to Death"" and was recently used in ""Syngenor"".) I liked this film better than ""Aliens"" and it's sequels. SO THERE!I would have liked this Diamond DVD release better if the disc was in stereo and not mono. And why does Diamond DVD tout chapter selections, when you can't access that particular scene?"
2,What was I thinking,"I first saw this movie on TV when I was a young teen, and remembered it as being scary. With that in mind, I purchased Creature hoping to relive the exprience.I am sorry to say that I was grievously disappointed. Two of the male characters were really hurting for a haircut. THe movie came out in the mid eighties, I remeber long hair being out even then.THe dialouge and special effects were cheezy, and the acting ranged from poor to fair.I guess I must have been tired the night I watched this film in the late eighties, that's why it appeared to be scary.I gave Creature two stars, however, because it had one or two geunine scares. I guess I'll have to wait until I'm really tired again to enjoy this film now. That's if I don't fall to sleep first."
4,Bringing the conversation to life,This book has helped me to develope dialogue between the characters. It shows you what works and what doesn't. This is a must have book for the serious writer.
1,Sappy at best!,"I can't beleive a publisher would charge $... plus for this book. I kept waiting for it to pick up and half way through the book realized it wasn't going to. I wonder if I could get half my money back? For the cost and for your time, I'd recommend against this book."
5,a perfect blend of content and brilliant writing,"I cried, I laughed, but am mainly in awe of such wonderful writing and such insight . I read it in 2 days and go back to it often."
1,not worth it,"Within 1 year, the coffee pot broke. When it did work, it didn't filter well. Coffee ground residue was very heavy in every cup of coffee. This is a cheap coffee pot that is highly overpriced for what you get."
2,The knob is the weak link,"I've had two of these units and they have both suffered from broken knobs. Looking around the 'net, I've see others complain of this flaw as well. The replacement is twenty bucks plus shipping, so figure on ordering one of these as well. As long as the knob holds up the pot itself is nice and brews a great, hot cup of coffee."
4,Great for what it is,"It's exactly as described. Accurate, powerful, and attractive for a C02 pellet gun. The only problem is that the handle is a bit large for women and children."
3,"Looks nice, feels nice, but weak.","I know it's only 435 FPS...I got some Crosman Premeire's that are 10.9 grain and I couldn't even piece a thin piece of sheet metal, which is disappointing, as I planned to use this for plinking / small varmints, but it is tragically weaker than even the cheapest rifle variant."
3,uhh,"this gun is ok. it leaks co2 most of the time. sometimes it miss fires,but it shoots pretty hard and is acurate. i would not use wadcutter pelets in this because they jam almost every time you shoot."
5,Add this to your collection!,"This pistol turned out to be much better than I expected. I just recently began to collect pellet & BB pistols and I am inclined to buy those that are mostly made of metal. But this pistol, with very little metal, is as much fun to shoot as my Walther CP99 & Dan Wesson 8"" revolver. I like the 10 pellet rotary clip. It's very quick and easy to load. I've had excellent accuracy shooting targets from 20 feet. I would recommend this for anyone who likes to collect & shoot pellet pistols."
2,Ouch! This one hurt without even squeezing the trigger ...,"I've owned a number of air guns and enjoy shooting them immensely, I'd always wanted a revolver style one but this one's price pretty much sums up what it's worth unfortunately.Operating it is difficult, including reloading, getting the C02 in properly is quite a chore and I ended up with more than a few bleeding cuts on my hand, not user friendly at all.The construction is unfortunately cheap as well, the trigger is sharp plastic and many of the other parts provide a very unrealistic weight to the gun which just isn't fun. After it punctured two C02 canisters that I had, I decided it wasn't worth keeping, I couldn't get it to operate properly."
3,"good air pistol, bad grips","I found this pistol to be pretty good as far as power and accuracy go for this price point. The grips on mine did not fit snugly/tightly and the body of the gun has a tendency to move around in the grips. I looked online and found that many people have experienced this issue. I ended up using bat tape to hold the grips tighter together to lessen the movement of the body in the grips. This is of course cumbersome when you want to change the co2 cartridge. If this is something that you would not consider doing, or if the loose grips are going to worry you, then you would be better off looking at another pistol."
3,Where is It?,It's a month later and I still haven't received it. Will there be any WWII vets left when it does arrive?
4,World War II History,It has well researched and well written articles. Substantive book reviews. I've subscribed for four years and will continue to subscribe.
2,"I thought for the price, that I was getting two handles.","Dumbbell handle is ok, but I thought I was receiving two handles and not just one. I suggest you buy from somewhere else.Update - I also see they label it one dumbbell now and not leave you guessing."
4,"Great, but not like the others","My 4 year old daughter loves this book, but I can tell by the number of requests to read it that she doesn't love it as much a Rolie Polie Olie and Snowie Rolie. It just doesn't have the same appeal to her. Maybe it's because it lacks the ""catchy"" rhymes of the other two or it's the story. Who really knows what goes on in the mind of a four year old. Anyway, anything with Olie and Zowie is a winner, but just don't expect a book like Rolie Polie Olie or Snowie Rolie."
3,Bartlet Storage Rack,"Bought to hold Farberware pot lids. The rack, while well made, had the spacing too narrow to hold any lids. It was returned."
5,Only the best for my dog,"Our dog loves this food. We tried the salmon and the whitefish flavors also but he clearly likes the chicken the best. We have only used wellness for our dog and his coat remains shiny, he is at an appropriate weight and full of energy, and has healthy bowel movements. I think this is the best you can get and well worth the price in the longevity your beloved pet gains in eating a healthy, natural diet."
1,It's different than the ones from stores,"The idea is great. Save trips to the store and is cheaper than the stores but when I opened the bag, it smelled funny and color is much lighter than the ones that I bought from the stores. My two Labradors actually turn their heads away from the kibbles. How do you return the opened bag with loose kibbles ? So I tried to feed the kibbles to the dogs and they were having diarrhea or very soft stool and I'm not happy with that type of situation at all. The Wellness dog food is good but something about shipping makes me wonder.... Anyway I went to the local pet store got the same kibbles and my babies are happy ever after."
2,embarrassing,"Got a wellness dog treat before which the dogs absolutely loved. Then i bought this dog food... very weird. None of my four dogs like it. Sniff, and go away. Regardless how good it is... if it can't even appeal to the dogs, it means nothing. Only one of my dogs is picky about food; others love almost every brand; esp. the 1st time they try a new dog food.Not this one. Embarrassing for me cuz I've opened it and can't return it."
1,Made my dog ill.,"Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken. Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine."
2,NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for,"My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble. Well, let me say...I'm disappointed. It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching. The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my ""stomach of steel"" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be."
3,a pretty good book for general information.,"the pictures in this book are amazing, although for the project i was working on, i found it lacking where it covered roofotp gardening. it seemed to be too general to give very accurate information for what i needed."
3,For large roofs mainly,"Interesting, but mainly specialized to larger roof garden. Therefore less suitable for a relatively smaal balcony"
2,Disappointing Read,"I was very impressed and throughly enjoyed Alex Kava's first two novels. Not so with her third book. There was character jumping from chapter to chapter, which made for choppy reading. The identity of the killer is apparent half way through the book. Thank goodness I didn't spent the money on the hardback edition."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.It start's with a standoff between the ATF and FBI and a group of young men holed up in a cabin near Neponset River in Massachusetts. Shots are fired and people are killed. So starts this thriller, written by one of my favorite up and coming authors. Alex Kava has a writing style that will keep you enthralled. I found the involvement of Maggie's mother with 'The Father' to be a little coincidental to the plot, still yet the overall story, along with the suspense and thrills, put a damper on that.Recommended"
4,Very happy with this purchase. Easy to use.,"I bought this for my husband who loves his old records and is pretty much computer illiterate.It took us 5 minutes to figure out how to record and burn CD's. Sound quality ok. (Not great but as good as can be expected from old, dusty records and a compact unit). I use it to burn CD's for dance lessons. There are a lot of great old records that have not been released on CD that I now can use for dance classes. (Old Middle Eastern bellydance classics that I can now play on CD in class!!!)I would definitely recommend this unit. Computer programs might be of better quality but for a simple solution this is definitely the way to go!"
4,TEAC GF-350 Novice Notes,"The machine works well. Be sure to read the directions compeletely before you start though, and be prepared when you begin your recording to click the proper button on the remote to create the 'next track' or you'll have an album on a track. I had read online about this potential pitfall and so was somewhat prepared for it.I would recommend buying a few CD-R audio discs so you can practice on a rewriteable disc. I only bought the 50 pack of audio CD's that Amazon was recommending, but they are not re-recordable. Every time I screwed up, it was another disc in the trash.I was surprised and pleased to see that I can attach my cassette player to this and make CD's from my cassettes. That was a nice bonus feature.The sound on this unit's speakers are not so hot and that left me wondering what I was going to have as a finished product. However, when I put my 'new' CD of Bob Seger singing ""Ramblin Gamblin Man"" (an out of print album) on my big stereo speakers, the sound was great."
3,Error Code 4,"When the unit accepts a blank disk, it works great. However, the unit gives me error code 4 quite often when inserting a blank disk. I'm going to have to return it to the vendor or send it to TEAC for an alignment adjustment since there are no authorized service centers within 100 miles of my home."
5,Great,"I am in the process of recording my vinyl collection to CD. So happy that this product has been developed. Just be careful when you unpack this and follow the directions concerning the stylus carefully so you don't break a part off in error. Buy CD- for music as recommended. I am now able to listen to my ""Blind Blake"" music recorded in Nassau in the Bahamas 1951-52 in my car! Many new trips down memory lane lie ahead."
1,TEAC Customer service is a JOKE,"The radio is fine, but I lost the manual. I emailed TEAC to get a replacement and was informed that they'd sell it to me for $33 plus $4 shipping! For a tiny little 2 page manual! Absolutely ridiculous. The products are good, but the support is worse than bad. Buy a Tivoli instead - they answer the phone, they support their products, and their manuals are posted online for free."
4,WAITING FOR YEARS,I used to be a disc jockey and I have over 2000 albums and tapes.THE records are getting harder and harder to play and I always thought that I wanted to put them on cd'S. Well here is the product that will enable me to do just that. The price has come down to a reasonable price and now I'L BE ABLE TO RECORd AND TO CATALOGUE EVERY THING. hEY ANYONE WANT TO BUyALBUMS CIRCA 40'S 50'S 60'S 70'S AND 80'S?
1,Disappointed with TEAC GF-350 and TEAC,"I purchased the GF-350 several months ago and have been sorely disappointed. It only takes limited types of recordable CDs. The recordings I made will only play on the GF-350... they have not worked on other CD players (home or auto), portable devices, or home computers. TEAC has been useless insofar as customer service and support: they have not responded to my inquiries even though I tried to contact them by phone, mail, and email. I would not buy this product and, personally, I will no longer deal with TEAC."
2,High price for what you get.,"Found this product to do as advertised. It makes decent CD's of LP's that you can play. Thought it could have a lots better radio for the money. This one was like a old tuner with the sliding dial, not LCD or no presets. Volume knob is like the old radios too."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS - GET SOMETHING GOOD LIKE A SONY,"FORGET ANY TEAC STUFF, LEAVE IT BEHIND, GET A SONY, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!, August 25, 2007WE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF BUYING A VERY SIMILAR UNIT, THE GF-600. AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS THE CASSETTE RECORDER AND THE CD PLAYER WENT BAD. HERE LATELY THE POWER SWITCH DIED. CRIMINAL CHARGES OUGHT TO BE LEVELED FOR PEDALLING JUNK LIKE THIS.BTW, I CHALLENGE TEAC TO CALL ME AND MAKE IT RIGHT - 703-878-8952 - I'LL BET THEY WON'T.I ALSO INTEND TO DISCOURAGE ALL MY FRIENDS FROM PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM TEAC, AND i WISH TEAC AN EARLY BANKRUPTCY.SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A GOOD BRAND LIKE A SONY - THEY LAST AND LAST, AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,TEAC GF-350 Turntable/CD Recorder,This recorder is of very high quality and is simple to set up and use. A record can be recorded to a CD with a single push of a button. I highly recommend this product.
3,OK stuff for a li'll child to play,"This is good for a starter child like for a 3yr - 4yr old. But once they get access to the RC stuff, they never gonna look at it."
1,Not as good as hoped,"As a fan of Dre and Tupac, I expected some serious work from the duo. It appears (and only appears) to me that death row sold some rights to some songs to a foreign studio to play with. This is the result. It is not a quality Dre or Tupac Album. I do not recommend this CD to anyone."
1,Bad song for a debut single,"Casey Donovan might have won Australian Idol, but her debut single has failed to please the fans nor the charts.Selling only platinum status after nearly 1 month of sales made her the lowest selling winner or even runner-up. The reason is the song is a remake of a relatively unknown american singer Cece Winans, and the song is just not good enough to make an impressive impact.Sorry Casey. Hope you release something better next time round. In the meantime, strongly NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Does the job,"I am using the towel rack, and it is good for multiple towels. However, of course if multiple towels are used, it must be kept swung open for each towel on the rack. Also, if someone doesn't fold it up right, it doesn't look good ""hanging"" off the edge of one of the wooden spokes. We have a small kitchen, so it is space-saving. It is an OK product."
5,Great!,"I bought this T-shirt for a friend of mine and he is satisfied with the quality and I liked it's material too, so it is a great T-shirt I recommend to everybody who loves reggae, or Bob! :)"
1,Get all episodes on Netflix,"Did you know all 92 episodes are on Netflix for the same price as 7 episodes on DVD? What a greedy idea. They could have at least put commentary. Some of the episodes are kind of the low points in the series. One started in the present and played itself backwards. In another one Candace goes to a spa. Phineas and Ferb are usually funny because of their nerdy irony and super awesome ideas, but I do not like watching the same thing over and over again, even a genius cartoon like Phineas and Ferb. Get a subscription to Netflix unless you actually LIKE repeats and lame Perry activities."
5,Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files,"I can't stand the majority of today's cartoons, but Phineas and Ferb is an exception due to the creative writing behind the show. Typically, each episode has two segments, and each segment is split between Phineas/Ferb/Candace and Perry!The episodes on this DVD are:1. No More Bunny Business/ Spa Day2. Split Personality/ Brain Drain3. Candace Disconnected/ Magic Carpet Ride4. Ask A Foolish Question/ Misperceived Monotreme5. Mommy Can You Hear Me?/ Road Trip6. Perry The Actorpus/ Bullseye!7. Escape From The Tower/ The Remains of the PlatypusThis is a great DVD to own. My favorite segment is Road Trip, where Phineas and Ferb build and operate a truck stop diner over their parent's moving RV."
5,Christian Unity Nobly Defended,"These two mini expositions, of John 17 and Ephesians 4, calmly show the error of today's ecumenical push.Those who look down upon the separated parts of God's Church really need to pick up The Basis of Christian Unity and deal humbly with its message. It is the hot pursuit after a unity condemned by the Lord and Scripture that is the real cause of schism. This anti-biblical vision is closely connected to, or part of, `The New Evangelicalism.' Though it is not called that as such in here, that trend is identified and corrected in this book. `Don't judge' is its familiar, out of context, motto.If this little green booklet seems too slight to put confidence in, then the reader should seek out Lloyd-Jones' full exposition of John 17 or his massive exposition of Ephesians."
4,Parental Oddness,"PARENTAL ODDNESS IS SUBJECT OF FUNNY ESSAYS - Charleston Gazette-Mail.Nadine was orphaned and taken in by a mountain farm widow to raise. She did not marry Vincent Erwin, a chemical plant worker, until she was 30. The Great Depression was ending, but Nadine took in dire times, peddling cheap Christmas trees door to door. She often sold or traded her household furniture, and Vincent complained, ""That woman has sold my bed."" The Erwin family experienced many funny twists and odd episodes including watering the lawn at two o'clock in the morning. ""Cures insomnia,"" Nadine claimed. An enjoyable story about a unique couple."
5,When will it go to DVD???????!!!!!!!!!!,"THE BEST HISTORICAL FILM to date, and it needs to come out on DVD!!"
3,Exciting and watchable historical drama,"This film depicts the early, tumultuous years of Catherine the Great of Russia, before she ascended the throne. Julia Ormond gives a fine performance as the lovely, vulnerable but very savvy young German princess who has been summoned to Russia by Empress Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave hams it up here, and looks like she had great fun) to marry her cruel and warped nephew Peter. The script takes great liberties with the actual events--Catherine was a woman of 33 when she assumed the throne, not a teenager as the film shows, and her lover Gregory Orlov was a much more dangerous character than the film depicts. But it is a rousing and enjoyable film, especially for anyone who enjoys costume dramas. END"
5,NOTHING LESS THAN EXCELLENCE,"This is true of this video. The movie I found good but the extras are excellent. If any flaw, the director seems to ignore an important part of the code. ""A cadet must not lie, cheat or steal"" is stressed but the remaining part of the code, ""or tolerate those who do,"" is down played, obviously in sympathy to the code violaters and to enhance the plot. Excellent all around dvd and am giving it as gifts to my brothers for Fathers Day who will enjoy the sports history aspect and the very informative and interesting extras."
4,A Butterscotch lover's dream,"Clearly written, well thought-through recipes. Easy to follow, with enticing pictures making it an appealing book even to some one who does not cook, but would like to enter into a world in which all their favorite desserts could be transformed into butterscotch!"
3,Stinky gas and loos stoole,"I think this product is good, but my puppy does not go well with this product. She got loos stool and stinky gas all the time. I needed to change the food."
2,My Puppy likes Purina Better,"My Puppy was on Royal Canin but we switched her to Wellness Pupy b/c I eventually wanted her on Wellness Core but she doesn't seem to like it. I have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it. She was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full. She seemed more solid, like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week. Apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food. Now that she's home, she's gone back to barely eating it. I'll try another brand after we finish this bag. I'm sure the nutrition in it is great but if I can't get my dog to eat it, what good is it?"
3,sold out,this used to be an awesomely organic solution to healthy petfood with no fillers.... i have been informed that the company is soldout and is no longr as quality since it is mass produced. i would rate it about the same as iams or purina now.(we now use 'taste of the wild'- made with blueberries and buffalo to name a few)
2,Disappointing,"I am a Java newbie and purchased this book in addition to the Head First Java text to get me started. I am a big fan of the Cookbook series, and have generally been very satisied with them. However, the Java Cookbook has been a disappointment.I must echo the sentiments of ""schrapnel"" in his review of this text. The recipies given seem designed to teach general concepts rather than solve common programming problems. The result is a general Java textbook that is encumbered with the Cookbook format of Problem, Solution, Discussion. There are numerous instances of the Problem being trivial, or downright silly. For example, ""You really want to know about end-of-line characters"" and ""You need to learn the syntax of JDK 1.4 regular expressions"" are presented as Problems for recipies. Clearly, the author is reaching a bit too far in his attempt to present the material in cookbook format."
2,A cookbook indeed!,"If you are a Java novice with an interest to learn quickly how the Java language is used without wanting to dwell into the fundamentals, this book is for you.On the other hand if you want to learn the Java language throughly, this book will make you learn the wrong habits since it contains several subtle errors that will escape a novice's eye."

5,Nice book,"Very Cute! my 6 year old daughter like it a lot, easy and fun reading! Highly reccommended! it talks about Emma Having allergic reaction to dogs or hair pets and the way they solved this problem, so that the family would be able to have a pet."
5,Broad appeal,The fact that a chapter of this book appeared in the December 2001 International edition of Reader's Digest is a testimony to its broad appeal.
3,Jakob 4 Amazon 0,Leave it to Amazon to post reviews of the US version of Jakob the Liar in the file for the East German version of the film. Well done Amazon. Your incompetence with respect to reviews doesn't surprise me any more. Still I must continue to salute it.
1,Do Not Buy,"Kristin is right, it's sticky and it stays on the fur. Moreover, I followed the directions to a T . . . but when my cat shook her head, the product went into one of her eyes. It was clearly extremely painful for her. There is no caution anywhere on the label stating that this product is an eye irritant or worse. I bought this product to help my cat's ears, not hurt her eyes."
1,Missing maerial from Keyboarding & Formatting,"My classes started last week and I found out I needed this book. When I received the book, I had no Student User Guide and I could not use the product because the CD accompanying the material did not have the Keyboarding & Formatting software setup on it. All it has is the lessons to be run on keyboarding pro. The description of this item is misleading. It indicates that you will recieve everything you need to install and run keyboading & formatting. What do I do now?"
4,LIVE album,"I haven't listened to this album enough to give it a decent review, since it just arrived today. But I would like to pass along that this is a live album. I wasn't expecting that, and I'm somewhat disappointed that it is a live album instead of just a collection of songs. So be warned. The songs themselves are just what I expected, however. If you want a ""live greatest hits"" this is probably the album you're looking for."
5,Best for beginner,"Bought 2 other books to ready my self-teaching. I purchased this as a 3rd book, should have looked at ratings of 2 other customers above 1st before buying any book, this is the only book I or anyone else beginning need. Explains and gives illustrations, same one you see in the computer, not like the other 2 books had to struggle to see what author meant.I don't have much patience in going into details of a new program, want to just breeze through. This book allows you to do that, can easily bypass instruction you that is obvious."
4,Works great for what I do,"I fly fish a lot, and for me, this bag works great! I actually use it with my Zune and in areas where the other option is to listen to road noise, having the option to listen to my mp3 player instead is great. With this bag I don't have to worry about incidental splashes or the occasional fall into the water.My only complaint is that the loop through which the arm band straps through the bag is starting to rip a bit. The vinyl isn't as tear resistant as I'd hoped."
3,fabulous world of jules verne,"saw this in the theaters when it came out in the 60's? have been hunting for a reissue and was enthusiastic to purchase a copy. was disappointed because the dvd was obviously made from a low def vhs which negated the entire concept of a victorian era appearance of detailed ink line animation. i hope someone can locate an original canister of the film and release this movie as it was originally meant to be seen (which was very cool, even now)"
1,Starved,"I had such high hopes for this book. I couldn't wait to devour it in one sitting. However, I walked away...starved. This had such great potental. Some of the characters in her family began to whet my appetite but stopped short. Perhaps if a fmily tree were included in the book it would have helped when she jumps from one generation to the next. Yes, she should be very proud of the accomplishments of her family, but you get the feeling she just needed to write this book so she too could say she accomplished somthing. Where is the story of a restaurant family? You heard more about what they did with the riches they earned from the restaurant than you did about being a restaurant family. If you are starved for some true comfort reading try Comfort Me with Apples, or Tender at the Bone, both by Ruth Reichl. Or pick up any of M.F.K. Fisher's books and savour a true gourmet of both food and words."
1,This sucks,An insult to the game and the gayest looking billy/jimmy and shadowmaster I've ever seen.
3,Nice looking; basic features,"This was a replacement for a builder-installed Delta faucet that used the single ball valve. The set looks nice, but I should have realized that the price was too good to offer more than basic water control. Unlike the ball valve it replaced, there is no independent control for pressure, so you set the valve for the right temperature and you get the pressure you get. Also, I'm disappointed with the flow pattern of the tub spigot. That could be an installation issue (I was less than impressed by other aspects of the hired installers work, so it may not be a fair reflection of the product). I have not yet used the show head, as we decided to continue using the one we already had and were happy with, so my comments pertain only to the water control valve and spigot.I am happy with the finish and appearance of the set. It has an upgraded look to it compared to the original Delta set I had."
3,Good for divers; not so much for casual users,"This case is meant for serious divers/snorkelers only. Each use of it requires quite a bit of preparation. The instructions recommend removing and greasing the o-ring, then testing the case submerged to the intended depth sans-camera for five minutes to ensure waterproofness prior to every use. There are after-use care instructions as well. Plus, you'll need to buy a new I-ring at least yearly, and buy more of the special grease more often than that. It's also *extremely* bulky.If you just want a camera to use in the swimming pool or occasional snorkeling trip, a camera that's waterproof out of the box may be a better option. The picture quality will be slightly lower due to lens limitations -- you probably wouldn't want it as your primary camera. Then again, this case costs nearly asmuch as a second camera.If you intend to do a lot of diving with your Stylus 760, though, this may be just what you need. As a casual user, it wasn't what *I* needed."
1,It breaks; not reliable,"Over the past two years we've had FIVE of these watches. The functionality is great, and they worked fine at first. All but one of the five have failed after two weeks to three months of use. Sometimes they go blank, sometimes they just freeze and don't respond to the buttons. You can't rely on this product so I don't recommend it."
1,I was sent old product that doesn't work correctly.,"When this watch arrived it didn't work. I had to spend $20.00 to put in a new battery. Inside the watch was a date sticker indicating that that battery was over two years old. Apparently, whoever sent the watch to me was trying to clear out old stock. And, .... not all of the functions work correctly."
3,Is anyone concerned about heating food in plastic?,"I am in a freezer group and the other moms use this product. I have been tranfering their dishes into glassware when I take them out to defrost as I am uncomfortable heating food in plastic. We learned years ago that microwaving in plastic is terrible so this feels just as bad to me. I know that that is exactly what these are made for, but I am still uneasy with it. Any thoughts?"
1,HAWAIIN DELIGHT COOKIE/NUT TREAT,Too many round wooden toys - bird cannot get a grip on them. Would be better to have flat wooden toys instead. Cookies and nuts were fine.
5,Very good information,This book was filled with really great information and made me question a lot of things in my own life. Highly recommended reading for any homosexual looking for some enlightenment or direction in their life.
2,Unreliable eye candy,"While eye-filling and fairly comprehensive, David Day's work is not a reliable guide to the intricately detailed world of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth novels. Day is entirely subjective, interposing his own interpretations and additions onto Tolkien's text. Tolkien's fans, who tend to have their own strongly-held opinions about such things, will most likely be annoyed, offended, or outraged. Fan fiction has its place, but not when it is marketed as a faithful representation of the original."
1,Wig,"I purchased 2, 60 in wiggs so that I could go as cousin it. The wigs were verry long just as the say but they were very thin. 2 wigs were not enough (thick enough) to cover myself for my intended costume. the color was very nice. So depending the purpose of the wigs it was an ok item. They were synthetic and not real life feeling and you can not brush out or comb them when they became tangled."
1,Mediocre.,"This wig is too thin to adequately cover anyone's head. It is not easily brushable. I am only going to use it to try to create extensions. The colour is nice, but if you're using this as the sole wig for your event, I would recommend another wig. While it is definitely as long as the picture shows, it is far too thin for anyone's head."
1,Not alcohol free,Important note that the chocolate stevia contains alcohol. It is NOT alcohol free. (Though I don't know about the other flavors.)
5,This is by far the BEST,"I have also tried different brands of stevia and xylitol. The NOW brand is by FAR the BEST. The other brands have aftertaste and are just plain ""yuck"". This is THE BEST!"
3,Mom123,"After trying this and many other brands of Stevia, my opinion is that it does not taste good in coffee. It tastes okay in tea, however."
5,A must have,"For lovers of early 90's pop/rock; this disc should be in your collection. Great songs that stick in your head long after you hear them. There are easy 5-6 great singles on this album, and the album as a whole has nary a weak link. Best tracks; Window Pane, The Truth, For You, In Your Hands, She, and Words. If this is available at a discount price (used); gobble it up."
5,Excellent coverage of art modelling,"In this age of photography, there is still a healthy subculture of models and artists who hold drawing the nude figure in the highest regard. Peter has numerous recent interviews with both models and artists in the San Francisco Bay Area. His book covers the experience of the art model particularly well. If you have ever wondered what it is like to get up in front of a bunch a strangers and model in the nude, there are good insights here. Highly recommended."
3,the four temperaments,"As a matter of fact, Hindemith is not very important for me, nevertheless I was interested in these two ballets."
4,More than I'd bargained for.,"I thought that I bought this for the David Duchovny song, but Bree Sharp's album goes so much further than this star-struck melody lets on. Songs like Smitten and Not Your Girl offer insightful lyrics and a tremendously professional yet not overdone sound. Songs range from a touch of country to a lot of attitude. She's a cross between Delores O'Riordan and Alanis Morrissette with a style all her own. A great start to a promising career."
4,Sharp as a tack,"I'll admit it. I purchased Bree Sharp's ""A Cheap and Evil Girl"" for the David Duchovny song. But even without the song ""David Duchovny"", I probably would have purchased this CD anyway. The title of the album alone sucked me in. And it doesn't stop there. I was expecting to maybe to like a song or two beyond DD, but the whole album is great. From the first song on the album, it made me want to listen to the entire thing, which I did all day. The stand out tracks in my mind are ""America"", ""David Duchovny"", ""Not Your Girl"", ""A Cheap and Evil Girl"", ""Walk Away"", and ""Guttermouth"".I recommend you get this album if you like female musicians along the line of Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow."
4,Still Works Well After All These Years,"Fairly good special effects, budget and an impressive cast bring Martin Caidin's classic novel to life. The almost documentary feel of 'Marooned' may have been intentional and space films often looked to the fantastic far-future rather than the realistic near-future 'Marooned' portrayed. This film is rather slow and deliberate at times, but that isn't a surprise considering that movies like '2001' were also made in this era. So 'Marooned' is to be valued as a realistic rarity in any decade. There were and ARE too few real space program films being made. If only Martin Caidin had written more things like 'Marooned'."
2,Painfully Slow,"The premise is a good one, and the special effects are very good for the pre-digital era, however, sometimes I felt as though I was suffocating and not the astronauts. I rate it as just OK....no more."
3,Do waste your money,The story about Mars is very short and did not really add more information about the main story. The other two short stories are cute but I don't think it is worth 10 bucks.
3,Average Read,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. I enjoyed reading it because I was already interested in the concepts. Debeers cover up, master marketing, Bloody wars funded by diamonds that rich people wear. I soon came to realize that there was little of that. This book could have been written much better. All the components of a fascinating story are here. Instead you are left with a feeling of, ""I know diamonds are evil stop telling me the same thing over and over!"" I wish that this book would have gone deeper into the lives of the people that this industry has a negative effect on."
4,A better way to buy this song - NOW 46,"You can spend eleven bucks and get this one song, but why would you when for triple the price you can get 40 times as many tracks.The UK import album, NOW 46, which is available from Amazon, has the original full length single of this track, plus new tracks by Samantha Mumba, Moby, and 40 more great pop tracks, most of which were, like Black Legend, huge dance hits in Europe.Like the US NOW series, these are full length unedited tracks."
4,Burberry Brit EDT for Men,Amazon had the best price we could find for this product. Really good classic fragrance that is not too heavy.
1,Fake Cologne,I got a fake version. The package was opened before and was resealed with scotch tape... Bar Code was glued on.
5,Smells so good!,"I LOVE this scent! It smells great on my man, and settles into a delicious, warm, manly, but somehow vanilla like scent. You don't need much. This bottle should last awhile!"
2,Not as I had imagined it would smell,"very musky. I was expecting ""fresh"" but found it to be more like generic Brut cologne or something along those lines."
2,variations on a poet,"A selected poems translated by various translators has always seemed to me a questionable undertaking as it erases the overarching style and power of the poet. That is certainly the case here. Some translations are brilliant and capture the unique feel for the ""labyrinthine"" mind of Borges, while others are flat or prosaic or simply uninspired. This unevenness inevitably shadows the poet, and creates the impression of arbitrariness in Borges as a poet."
4,Fronst & Nixon interview,Its a great video to watch! My son and I watched it before going to see the movie to get a better perpective of the story and events that occurred at that period of time. Watching the interview was like watching two heavyweights in the ring and seeing punch after punch.
4,IT'S OK,I am disappointed that the dvd is not the entire interview. I would much rather have seen more of the President Nixon and Frost exchange and skipped the present day commentary by David Frost.
4,Mount,"I researched many units, since I was getting ready to mount (professionally installed) a 46in LCD on my brick fireplace. Worked out great. The unit is very heavy, but the quality of the construction is superb. The swivel is smooth and easy.The grip plate instructions don't seem to match the picture, so it was a little confusing. Follow the grip plate instructions carefully since my mounting holes on my flat panel had varying depths and with the weight of the mount and TV exceeding 160 pounds, I installed extra grip plates for added assurance."
3,Exclusive,"Well, the book favors the spanglish vocabulary at the exclusion of the castillian. It would be more useful if the castillian usage was included."
1,It's just wrong.,"It may sound repetitive, but this is just wrong.Bettas deserve better than this!They are not toys to be carried around in a kid's thermos.I say, at VERY least, a gallon per betta."
1,"No fish, please!!!","This is NOT a suitable home for fish!!! No fish can live in this small amount of water. If you are interested in fish, please learn how to take care of them properly. Giving a child a fish in this deathtrap and having the fish die is not quite the message we want to send."
1,Cruelty to animals,"This is just a horrible horrible thing to keep a living creature in. It's the equivelant of YOU living in a suitcase! Not very fair, don't waste your money or your pet's life. Spend a little extra and get him at LEAST a 5gal tank."
1,Not good,"I bought it and the betta could hardly move in it.It just stayed in one place.We had to buy something larger and now it is swimming all over the place.I would not buy this, your betta won't last long."
4,"Excellent Receiver, not enough power","I've owned this for >2 years now. Of late the receiver has started going into Amp Error mode and I believe this is because it is unable to deliver the high current the speakers demand for movie watching. One thing to note is I am using this in the 5.0 mode with no subwoofer and that may be one of the causes.Otherwise, the sound is very clean, setup is very easy and intuitive, connectivity is abundant, features are easy to access, display is easy to read from a distance too, remote is well designed and it just works. I have not been able to find anyone with similar issues to mine for this particular model, but a net search shows other Pioneer models with a similar problem."
4,Tracing the Vocoder Timeline...,"...Roger/Zappheads mostly know about the vocoder-- essentially it digitallizes the voice to give that whiney robotic feel. Stevie used it, Peter Frampton used it, Stanley Clark used it, Teddy Riley uses it...you can hear it used on anyone from Jodeci to Cher to Mary Mary. Shortly after it was popularised by Frampton on his live album, Stevie did pick it up, and keyboardist Herbie Hancock did too--who was the first of the two is a mystery, at least to me. Anyway, it seems as if Herbie laid the groundwork for Zapp with this quick issue from Columbia, circa 1976...a year or so after ""Headhunters"" w/ that monster cut ""Chameleon"". This album, ""Sunlight"" is classic Herbie, and indeed, a true rarity...don't let the dance influenced tracks bother you. Hancock and group were truly innovating back then...get it for some funky jazz and to see how a mastermind works...."
2,dissapointed,This was totally not what I expected. Not really material more like plastic. Next time I go shopping in a store
2,I would have bought this,"if I was able to zoom in for a closer view. You cannot SEE this curtain in the photo provided. One reviewer said if youhad a bathroom that had a 50's design it would work. And my bathroom is vintage. However, I'm very disappointed the vendor provided such a crappypicture and therefore lost my business."
5,Frightening Depth and Realism,"While Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" depicted a school shooting through clever (yet ultimately boring) film techniques and character stereotypes, ""April Showers"" depicts this tragic event with frightening depth and realism."
3,So bad it's ... well ... REALLY bad,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies of the modern era, and it's just a darned shame that MST 3000 never got hold of it.That said, this is a FANTASTIC party flick. Slap it in the VCR and settle in for a couple hours of mockery and hooting. The movie closes with what is quite possibly one of the worst miniature sequences EVER done. It's beyond painful."
4,Dragonseye,It was published in US as Dragonseye.It's a good read.It feels you in on the whole story.
3,"Okay CD, but bad for young people","This song is okay, but he is not a good example. He has done many bad things and this song has many words and things that are not good for young people. I hope that young people aren't listening to this and having him as a role model."
3,Potential - but no class,"The ""Real Slim Shady"" is a musically catchy song. Some of the lyrics are even quite funny. but then there is that language... I'm not sure what possesses an artist to include such explicit words and subject manner. I'm not dissing their constitutional right to, but it escapes me that any artist could actually think I would spend my hard earned money to be degraded auditorily. After all, I wouldn't allow my friends to talk ""like that"" around me, I certainly wouldn't pay someone to do it. It's actually kind of sad because I think this individual has some real talent and had the potential to make a positive impact on society. But instead, he choked. That's right, he's just another ""shady"" looking to make the money the easy way. And that just doesn't impress me. In my opinion, this guy has nothing on Will Smith, even though he imagines he does."
5,An inspiring book,"I just finished reading Under the Overpass by Mike Yankoski and was challenged on many levels. I appreciated his fresh and new prespective about the homeless and the insights he gained from living on the streets for 5 months. It has changed the way I think about the homeless and I am glad I read it. Mike includes many Scripture verses and praise songs that were meaningful to him along the way, and made them practical to us today. I also appreciated his advice about what we can do in our own communities to help those less fortunate than us. THis book changed the way I look at my 'necessities' and made me realize how much I really do have. A roof over my head, food on the table, a bed to sleep in. Under the overpass is a quick, easy read, but also a very insightful one."
5,An insight into poverty in the United States,Easy to read and full of observations and insights of who is living on the streets of the United States and what it's like to live there. A great read for anyone who lives in this country.
5,Excellent resource,This book was definitely eye-opening about the homeless in our nation. He also gives tips on what we can do.
1,Under the Overpass Brief Review,"Under the Overpass, although it had an intriguing concept fell short of a particularly gripping story. It's very heavily edited and contains no swearing, as well as cuts out important cultural experiences of homelessness. It does a bit of a disservice to the lives some people live and the struggles they go through by mulling the grittier aspects of it over. The book is very heavily weighed down with faith and religion. It is much more geared toward believing in God and trusting that faith will get you through the worst of times than it is understanding severe poverty and the people that live it. The book is laid out nicely and is an easy read, but at a more middle school level. Again, most of the attention of the book is on Christianity as well as the author's personal views on life and how others should solve their life problems."
5,Awesome Book,This book was VERY interesting. Great book for a college age church study. For anyone who has ever felt a desire to be in a place where you must learn to depend on God completely... this is a super read
4,Excellent read,"As a recently unemployed person I had grabbed this book to get a real perspective of my own life. After reading this book I do realize how I am blessed. One little smile,one kind word,can make a difference to someone else. This is a must read if your looking to find out how to be a good and faithful servant. I heard about the book on the KLOVE radio station in CHICAGO."
3,Dark Side of the Supernatural: What Is of God and What Isn't,"Great book but not exactly what I was looking for, most of the information I was already aware of. I was looking for more information on demonic manifestations of ""vampires."" Author Rebecca Brown, gives an excellent scripture reference Psalm 57:4 in her book, He Came to Set the Captives Free."
2,The Honor Guard,"Because I'm nice, and was looking to see if the Wolf Lake series had been released, I looked this up for you all:It's actually an alternate title for the movie The Honor Guard, which is about a man unhinged by his son's death in the Vietnam war, who then goes on to terrorize a young couple.So, there you are. :) It was made in 1979."
3,NOT FOR STAINLESS,"while im sure this bit works fine on softer metals, it does not work on stainless at all. i was trying to drill fairly thin stainless (1/16""-1/8"") and could not get through the first step. do not buy for stainless."
3,An entertaining read for birders and mystery lovers,"Goff has a talent for creating believable characters and settings, which helped smooth over some of the less credible plot elements. The author was obviously new to birding when she wrote this debut mystery, and serious birders will roll their eyes at some of the gaffes (a rare bird alert is an informational phone message, NOT a state of emergency!). These problems were not serious enough to keep me from starting her second book immediately after I finished the first, and I look forward to seeing how Goff's birding knowledge and writing skills improve with future mysteries."
2,The tape player is below par,"This unit IS very attractive. The sound IS good. But the ""Casette Deck"" is a rectangular hole, with one button to fast forward/stop, and no buttons to rewind, or play. It's worse than the tape player in my old Ford.Then the darned thing stopped working. I was very upset, as this was a gift. Do not buy this product if you have any intention of ever playing casette tapes. Otherwise, it was nice."
2,Vital Information,"The item was delivered quickly and in good condition. But in the course of making the purchase, at no point was I warned that because it is US made, it will not work on a British voltage. I had an adaptor - that was not the problem. The problem was that when I switched on, there was a loud and alarming hum, an even more alarming bang and a frightful smell and that was the end of my Nostalgic Console. I have now found and ordered a British product which should arrive shortly.It is important that purchasers should be aware of full technical details before concluding a purchase - and that the information should also be put in plain English so that buyers without a technical background can make sense of it. Much technical information supplied with electrical products (I am speaking generally now) is incomprehensible to anyone who is not an engineer. Valerie Anand (Disgruntled of Mitcham)"
5,204 Rosewood Ln,This book was easy to read and went along with the first of the series. The characters keep evolving as the stories go and in this book the start to a second mystery is started and the ending of the first mystery that started in book one. really enjoyed this book cant wait to read the next book.
4,"It really seems to keep my eyes from being so dry, but the foam doesn't stick to the goggles very well.","Comfortable and effective in moisturizing my eyes. The foam rings tend to fall off the goggles within a few days, and soaking the inserts in hot filtered or bottled water is awkward (have to microwave the water in the kitchen, then go back to the bedroom to use the goggles). I'm glad to have discovered this product, though will need to find an adhesive to keep the rims attached. Thank you."
1,BUYER BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY !!!,"I bought another pack from this company (BeltPac), and while I did test the pack as described in the instructions, the pack leaked when I used it in the sea, destroying my phone and my mp3 player. I contacted Aquapac, as they claim to have a warranty if the pack if used apropriately, but they refused to refund me the pack or the content that was destroyed (MP3 player + phone).BEWARE WHEN YOU BUY ON OF THESE PACKS: EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS, THE PACK MAY LEAK AND THE COMPANY WILL REFUSE TO REFUND YOU.AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST!"
1,Unlistenable.,"For those of you who are interested in hearing Steve Howe's impersonation of Joe Satriani this disc may prove satisfying. For those of you who enjoy Howe's ability to draw from a variety of musical influence's to create creative and tuneful music this album will infuriate you. One would think that in pairing up with Bill Bruford, Howe would create some magical moments. Sadly, there's no magic here. Bruford's brilliance is lost beneath those miserable Simmons electronic drums he tinkered with in the early nineties. Howe overplays on every cut displaying none of the passion or creativity evidenced in earlier works. For a quality solo effort turn to The Steve Howe Album. Otherwise, stick to Yes' seventies output with Howe on guitar. Avoid this one...Simon"
4,Quality...,"Steve Howe, guitar legend of Yes, has established a clear style that comprises everything guitar...classical, rock, a little bit of country, but overall, the album is one of quality song-writing. One or two songs mirror the same structures used in his music with Yes on the ""Union"" album, but they were released the same year...so who cares. It is still a good album of good music."
1,Would fail 9th grade Lit,I love stories of the mountain men and I tried to tolerate the repetition and amateurism to get through this one but no use. Don't waste your time.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A story of a planet where the environment has caused the human race to mutate into several different sexes, so there are spectrums of gender to deal with. This can be a bit mind bending, and I had to write to the author for help with an explanation at one point!Definitely very interesting, with one character hiding what they are, and the political consequences of the decision."
5,Excellent! I read it twice!,"The ideas explored in this book, centering around gender identity and sexuality, never prevent the characters from being real people. Not for the fans of whiz-bang space opera, but a solidly written page turner, full of social and political intrigue. Once again, Melissa Scott has given us an imaginative yet believable universe with sympathetic multi-dimensional characters. You go girl!"
5,"Better even than ""left-hand side of darkness""","An intelligent social scifi-fantasy book, which does not forget action as well. The topic of gender is more earth-life adapted than U.Guin's book and the observations of transgender and intersex and gay problematics highly accurate.Best book I read last year. Absolutely recomended and I hope they reprint it!"
3,ok but not as good as her older stuff,"Back in the 80s, Melissa Scott's first few books were so good (exciting and thought-provoking with worlds and sciemces no one else had ever thought of) that since then I've rushed to buy her stuff -- in HARDCOVER ! -- whenever a new book comes out. But the past 4 books have been, well, nice but slow. And the worlds and ideas were, well, nice but seen them before from other authors' stuff.So hey Melissa, for old times sake I'm a fan still. But from now on, I'll wait for the paperback to come out.BTW: If you haven't read Melissa's ""The Kindly Ones"" DO!!!!!!"
3,Extremely Well Written,"Andreas has put together a great book however while appearing very comprehensive he has missed some very important view points, in fact perhaps the most critical.I must warn readers that Andreas advises readers to err on the side of MERCY, in respect to divorce and remarriage.I would strongly urge people to err on the side of 100% OBEDIENCE & 100% FAITHFULNESS, I cite Noah's obedience and faithfulness compared to the Israelites disobedience and lack of faith.If you would like more on the topic, and what Andreas missed - www.WiseReaction.org"
2,"If you are green might be good, if you have any knowledge...",you will see just how much this person is an outsider trying to look in and understand a world that is foreign to him. Very misleading and at times unbelievably naive.
2,Even the fish look bored,"This is a wonderful example of what is wrong with 3D television programming. This video consists of nothing more than fish swimming around aimlessly inside of fish tanks. No adventure, no plot, no excitement. This is a great video if you are having trouble sleeping. It will put you into a state of unconsciousness faster than a lobster which has been thrown into a pot of boiling water. Probably the worst 3D Blu Ray I have ever seen. My wife makes fun of it and I certainly would never use it to demonstrate the potential of 3D television to my guests."
2,Think about it for a moment,"After watching this boring loop for 3 minutes, it dawned on me - I just spent $12 on a fish tank video that is even more worthless the moment I take these glasses off to go do somethng else.Yup - I'm a sucker."
3,"well, it's aquaria","I bought this for 3D content. It is aquaria, but I was a bit disappointed that more ""dramatic"" depth doesn't appear in any of the images. Nonetheless, it is what it says it is."
4,BILLY THE KID GROWS UP,"Billy Gilman's voice has matured nicely and he has chosen age-appropriate music. He hasn't forgotten his country roots in this 'country' world that tries to make only music that can cross over into the pop/rock world. 'I Will' is one of my favorites on the album, but the duet with Pam Tillis is also hard to resist."
5,Stu Hamm kicks some serious butt on this album,"I loved this album from the moment a friend of mine lent it to me back in the day. From the opening of Black Ice to the final notes of Kings of Sleep, Stu takes you on a musical journey that ranges from the virtuosic to straight up rock out. Hamm shows that he can not only fires off notes with the best six-stringed players of the day, but he can lay back and groove with the drums as part of the rhythm section while the guitar player solos over top of it. Stu's playing is awe-inspiring, as he proved when he was playing bass with Joe Satriani. It shows off his high-level of proficiency, but it all makes sense. Anyone who loves guitar should own this album, if only out of sheer respect.Favorite tracks: Black Ice, Surely the Best, Call of the Wild, Kings of Sleep."
3,PICTURE DECIEVING,PRODUCT IS GREAT EXEPT FOR THE PICTURE OF IT SHOWS IT INSTALLED IN A CABINET WITH A TOP DRAWER AND THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE 50 QT BINS

2,SINGLE'S soul or RELIGIOUS soul??,"I love the Chicken Soup books & was very excited to read Chicken Soup for the Single's Soul.After reading the first few stories, I found myself getting aggravated as I realized that seriously 8 out of 10 stories in the book mention the Bible, God, Christians or some other religious aspect- I was SHOCKED. I even kept checking the cover of the book to make sure I was reading the right book!! I thought I was going to read Chicken Soup for the SINGLE'S Soul-- not Chicken Soup for the Christian's Soul.A book I was so much looking forward to, greatly disappointed me because of all the religious stories it contained. I found it strange (and annoying) and NOT what I wanted to read at all.Did anyone else notice this book seemed overly religious??"
1,Don't waste your money on this junk,"The alarm is difficult to shut off, takes about and hour of goofing around with it. One time I had to disconnect the whole thing to get it to shut off.This unit started popping fuses and over charging the battery after I had it for around 12 months.I sent it in once for service, which cost me $100 plus shipping.After about a year, it's doing the same thing again. Popping fuses.I'm supposed to send it in for repair again, but instead I'm going to throw it in the trash and look for a better quality pump.Also, I did a careful measurement and my unit pumps less than half the advertized gallons per hour, even when considering the pipe losses.I spend around $600 on this junk including the battery. What a complete waste.Absolute garbage, save your money."
1,Kindle edition poorly proofed,"The Kindle edition was obviously scanned from a printed version and then OCR was performed. As OCR isn't perfect, a proofreader must check for errors and correct them. This version has innumerable uncorrected errors."
4,One of her best,"I keep trying to kick my P.D. James habit, but every time I stray to another writer, I miss her incisive character portrayals and great sense of atmosphere. ""Holy Orders"" is one of her best, bringing together a creepy bunch of clerics, Dalgliesh at his contemplative best and a windswept theological school. There's lots of interesting meditation on hypocrisy and faith, and Dalgliesh even gets a love interest, although some glaciers move faster than this romance. James is at her strongest writing about powerful men and their foibles and odd backwaters of British culture. Doesn't get much better than this for an absorbing and powerful read."
2,Overlabored and obvious,"As a psychological novel, Death in Holy Orders is middling to good. As a mystery, it fails entirely. The culprit of the murder is obvious half-way through, with no attempt to even hide his guilt -- I wondered why on earth I should keep reading. Keep reading I did out of sheer stubborness, but even at the end, when the motive and mechanisms of the crime were all laid out, none of it really was all that convincing. If this is P.D. James at her best, I'd imagine some of her ""lesser"" works might send me into a coma."
2,A very dull story.,"Anyone that considers PD James the top British mystery writer has obviously never read anything from Colin Dexter. This story had great potential, but the combination of dull characters and a very slow pacing put an end to those hopes. James bogs down the first third of the story with background and detail overkill. When the story finally does get moving the charters involved are very dull and I really had to force myself to finish it. Better editing could have saved this story, but as with many of todays writers James tries to stretch a 200 page story into 400 pages with disasterous results."
3,Pretty good,"I liked the style and the story. I was very uncomfortable with not only the acceptance but the almost glorification of a pedifile, as if he were the victim!"
2,Death in Holy Orders is deathly dull,"As much as I enjoy reading P.D. James and especially the Adam Dalgliesh series, I found myself slogginng through the book. I nearly put it down. The plot is uninteresting and I found it difficult to care about any of the priests, ordinands, staff or guests of St. Anselm's (with a few exceptions). If you are new to the Dalgliesh series, you would be better off reading ""Cover Her Face"" or ""Devices and Desires."""
1,Almost Never Got Through This,"This was the hardest book for me to finish. I have read other titles by this Author and liked them, but this one was just awful to get through. I never really felt connected with the characters in any way."
2,Tanya can chant !!!,"I like Tanya's attitude, she knows how to put those men in the shade with her hype up lyrics, but one song that baffles is "" Man fi rule"", what the hell was Tanya thinking when she sang that crap!!!! I think she totally contradicts herself when she sings it. Who in the hell says that man fi rule anything? Tanya what's the deal with that?"
1,Drivel,"I was really dissapointed with this album considering how excited I was on purchasing it, looking forward to the return of real rock'n'roll. The lyrics have no content and come off as arrogant rather than humorous(not forgetting no melody). The production is crap, especially on the guitars.Basically, if i want 70's hair metal I'll take ac/dc and Van Halen thank you.The album starts on a good note but then The EP falls rapidly downwards- The vocals and lyrics get irritating silly andpretentious. All of this is cliched, sloppy and ingenuineThe guitar riffs, are so stolen from other bands its a bit of a joke."
3,An American History of the Bamboo Rod,"Very well written history of the evolution of the bamboo fly rod craft beginning in mid 20th century America. My greatest disapointment (as in with some singer/song writers) is Mr. Black has a penchant to remind us he is a liberal democrat. I fact I could have lived without. I mean really, who cares?"
3,Not as good as I remember,"I was a big fan of this series when I was in grammar school, and was really looking forward to rereading it. Sadly, not as good as I remember it to be. I think it would be a much stronger story without the overly frequent and lengthy explanations about Stile's top notch skills in the various games. It is established at the start of the story, that he is an expert gamesman who has spent his life training to develop a wide variety of skills in order compete in many different games. A quick summary at the begining of the book, would do better than a half page droning on and on about how in the Game, as a top player Stile was very familiar with (task at hand) and in fact (surprise) had won many games against less skilled player(s) because he was so good at (task at hand)."
5,hello girls!,"If you are a 90s man, only a 90s woman can wag the tail of the old dog. Here's to big hair and unmowed front lawns!"
1,fiasco of a product,"The price was hard to resist. I needed to back up the phone numbers on my cell phone (strangely Tmobile does not have a way to download the numbers from the phone )The product arrived in a shiny box stating 'SIM reader Lead Tide' (no model or serial numbers).Unfortunately it never worked. My W2k based computer detected the USB device, but could not find a proper driver, not on computer and not on included minidiskette, which contains over a dozen executable files from various vendors without any explanation, rhyme or reason. No manual was included not even the 'Guid book' advertised on the box (no 'Warranty repair-card/Extensional cable') [sic].Internet search just revealed many frustrated people trying to make the device work in vain, some claiming finding a partial solution, others giving up and accepting the loss.I feel this is a product never quite developed being put in a box and sold for a low price by a low reputation vendor with a thick skin."
1,Do not buy this,There are too many files you must hunt for online that are not on the cd. If you can read Chinese you may fare better than reading the English instructions for the software. I'm returning mine and will try something a little more expensive but from a company with better quality control.
1,poor quality device.,"I purchased two of these. absolute rubbish.As an enterprise level ""uber-geek"" I spent two hours fighting with this trying every trick to get it to work. No go. my colleague also spent about an hour on a separate PC. Neither one of us could ever get it to do more than show up in windows as a device.The install software is not intuitive, and apparently was created using a trial copy of the installer application (with splash screens of ""insert your logo here"", etc.)trying to actually USE the software was a joke. Documentation was virtually nonexistent, with almost all images in the HTML help files missing.I'd give this zero stars if that were possible. what a waste."
3,True - but not practical,"I bought this book hoping it would help me do a better job of removing those items from my life that steal my time.Basically, the author says that the key is to put first God's kingdom, and that everything else will take care of itself. While Biblically this is defendable, it really is not a practical help in managing the demands on my life. I finished the book feeling like I had wasted time instead of being helped to make better use of my time."
3,Cheaply made,"This has to be the cheapest made Tonka toy I have ever seen. It's just one big plastic molded part with stickers on. That said, it was cheap...only [...] so I guess I got what I paid for. I just expect more from the Tonka name."
3,A night to remember....,"Jason was shocked at the change in Georgia. Seven years ago she'd innocently initiated their one spontaneous night of passion, become pregnant - then disappeared.Now Georgia was back and Json intended to discover what really happened to their baby. If that meant being with her every minute of every day - and night - until she told him the truth, then that's what he'd do...."
5,this is why i love them,COB DID IT ONCE AGAIN! just when i thought bodom couldnt get any better...this EP is TOO good...i swear i cannot wait until this next album comes out...but let me take alittle time to say how good this one song was.....LOST TRASHED AND STRUNGOUT!!!i had fun with this song...this song is amazing...right now it is my favorite song (beside silent night bodom night) the other songs were ok...cuz i do like that cooper cover...but this song....its unexplainable...its soooo good....since the first time i heard this song i was bangin my head like their was no tommorow...i admit i didnt like it from the begining cuz they had gotten alot harder and less melodic but as the song progressed i fell in love wiht it! go buy this album...if u are COB fan...you wont be disappointed!~peace~
2,beware of english subtitles,"Great story, strong beginning, but gets bogged down. The two star rating is mostly a rating of the DVD set, which provided terrible english subtitles."
5,won't somebody play with me?,"wow! i have been searching for this book for ages! i can't wait to read it again. i have vivid memories of the super-brill illustrations that while sometimes horrifying, always intrigued me for hours. if my memory serves me correctly, there was a particularly fascinating picture of rats choking on bubblegum pancakes...but don't let this scare you away! i was a very sensitive child, and still adored this book. its story is easy to relate to at any age...we all have experienced that moment when our imagination runs ridiculously wild...and of course, despite the panic, it all works out in the end. i must have read this book a zillion times, and though that was about 20 years ago, i'm positive it would be a favorite today. this book is worthy of modern classic status!"
1,Junk,"This is the only product I could find that had a serial interface as opposed to a Web based front end. We need it to do automated power cycling of units and this allowed us to do it through simple custom serial software. Another reviewer complained about the host software. I can't comment since I never used it.Update1: Won't recognize daisy chaining on power up. Have to plug cables in after both units are on. Makes it useless.Update2: Had it apart because the display LED went out. For the DC component, the manufacturer actually put a wall transformer inside the case instead of building a power supply on the PCB. Very pool quality.Update3: Can't update the firmware to 5.x from a 4.x model. Must have too little EEPROM.Update4: Relays start failing after about 100+ cycles. This thing is junk. Great idea, just wish it was better quality"
2,incorrectly advertised,"This product did not fit my spare tire as advertised.It should have expressly stated "" will only fit 15 inch tires"". This was just a waste of my time. By the way I drive a Rav 4."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","This cart seems to have everything going for it until you try to put the wheels on. The knock-on caps designed to keep the wheels on the axles are a very poor choice of fastener. The second wheel on each axle is a wrestling match because with the ballooned-out wheel design, the axle will not touch the floor. Using a small wooden block to push up into the wheel rim and hold the axle in place results in rebound off the plastic wheel itself and an immense amount of impact force is required to hammer the knock-on cap onto the axle. The knock-on cap tool designed to fit around the cap and assist with hammering the cap onto the axle is plastic and only adds to the rebound when trying to strike with a hammer. My suggestions...unless the thing is already assembled, look for another choice and if you need a real workhorse buy a heavy duty garden cart from a hardware store because the cost will only be slightly more."
5,black lab,"I bought this for my granddaughter, age seven, who loves animals. She loved this puppy and carried it with her much of the time during a two week stay."
5,Super cute!,"There is nothing to dislike about this little pup. She is cute, soft and snugly. The stuffing is firm, but not hard."
5,Too hot to handle!,"Nouri and Gabe together, that is! Absoultely sizzling together! After following these two through two books in this exciting soap opera-type series, I can hardly stand the wait of seeing how it all turns out for them! I'm hooked, too! Like most people who enjoy this unique genre in reading material."
2,What Am I Missing?,I bought this book based on the on-line reviews I read. I thought it was awful! The characters were poorly developed and the story line was confusing. There were so many characters hopping into so many beds I couldn't keep them straight. I'll steer clear of this author in the future.
1,don't be guilable,"These reviews are not by readers! If you look at ""see all my reviews"" each of these 5 stars only give out 5 stars and rarely write reviews for any books other than this author. This book is poorly written and not well proofed -- many errors and typos. I threw it out!"
4,great but misleading!,"Just received this DVD (from...-they had the best price) and it's great but I am a little upset that I was misled by the notion of ""11 bonus songs"". Where are they? Where is Sympathy for the Devil, Gloria or Ruby Tuesday???? Are they referring to the couple of lines they sing at the end of ""Bad""?"
3,I loved it at the time,"Most of the Amazon reviews of this movie are glowing to say the least. However, the critical consensus seems to be that it is overblown, pretentious and a little embarrassing.My opinion falls somewhere in the middle. I saw Rattle and Hum when it came out and bought the soundtrack vinyl on the day it was released. I loved the movie at the time but I was also completely enchanted with the band back then, this was their follow up to Joshua Tree.Looking at it now, the whole Bono discovers the American Heartland thing is a bit much but who cares? This is a great band in their prime and they can be excused a little ego inflation."
4,Enter The Fight,"Wow, this is a breath of life into the pop-punk scene. There is nothing revolutionary about this album, but it is solid and very enjoyable, if you're into this music. You get hooked to the CD when you listen to it a couple times, and you may very well end up with The Fight stuck in your head all day. It's hard to pick the standouts because, although the album maintains a generic pop-punk sound to it, each song still manages to have its own personality."
4,Sad But Good Book,Teacup Full of Roses by Sharon Bell Mathis was a good book that I really enjoyed reading. Once I started reading it I couldn't stop. This book is showing challenges that alot of families have to go through with some of those challenges being bad. The book was sad at some points but you can't help but to keep reading to see what will happen next. I would recommend this book to people my own age and I know they will enjoy it. It is a really short terrific book and you can finish reading in less then a day.
2,JaQuita Price Ms. Scott 8th,"The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing."
2,teacup full of words,well the book ''tea cup full of roses'' was a well though out book it has drama family issues and a climax for the world at the end.but its super boring

3,An okay drama,Flower island was a good movie but it wasn't the best. I would have liked a summary about the movie before i bought it though and the quality was good.
5,Suzanne,This book was very inspiring to read especially since I am a Gulf war veteran myself and have grown up during the time. I really appreciated there stories.
3,Not as great as I hoped...,"The informational portion of this book is helpful, but I was disappointed in the appendix. There are many other references (Materia Medica, etc.) that are much easier to peruse, and you will certainly need a secondary resource for that purpose.The author's personal experiences in the field are very interesting, so I recommend it for an overview of the subject."
5,Happy to Find It!,I tried the local bookstores and found out that this book was out of print and couldn't be ordered. I found it on Amazon.com and was able to get it afterall. Thanks Amazon. :-)
2,Not for me,"When I received this book, I was expecting simplicity. This book is difficult to follow. You must have a homeopathic medicine cabinet full of the items they ask for before you can come up with any remedy. The ingredients are very difficult to find.I got lost reading it. It was too confusing for me."
3,keep it coming along,"This CD represents a sample of life out west and a little fun in the sun. This CD is compliled of a few songs with pretty good potential. This is a good starter CD for a band that may have a solid future ahead of them. If you have some extra change floatin' around give the Peacemakers a try, you might be surprised."
3,a good transition album,"I am a big fan of The Refreshments and their album ""big and buzzy"" is one of my all time faves. . . its an album that no matter how many times you recommend it, people ALWAYS love it.This album isn't as good as either of the two refreshments albums, but, I give them some leeway in hopes that this was just a quickie to gt their name out there, and that there is a more substantial album coming soon (I hope).That being said, the song ""green and dumb"" is fantastic and worth the price of the album itself, thrown in the fun ""Jack and Jose"" and the ""beautiful disaster"" and you have a pretty decent album."
3,Petco Pet Keeper,I orders these and recieved Petco Pet Keepers NOT Exo Terra Faunariums. The ones I recieved have dark green lids NOT black lids as pictured. The measurements are the same as the faunarium and it is a similar product but it is not the product pictured.
5,A true Zane Grey classic beautifully recorded.,"Upon the death of his uncle, Ernest Selby (a young man from Iowa) inherits the Red Rock Ranch in Arizona. When he learns that the ranch's twenty thousand cattle have dwindled to six thousand he suspects foul play. In order to investigate these strange circumstances, Ernest decides to go under cover and lands a job on his own ranch, posing as a tenderfoot cowboy. As he makes friends, enemies, and courts the haughty daughter of the crooked foreman, Ernest learns to enjoy cowboy life. He knows that his charade must end eventually, but not until he can find the truth behind the disappearance of so many cattle -- and claim the hear of Miss Anne Hepford. The Dude Ranger is vintage Zane Grey and this unabridged, five cassette audiobook edition is artfully narrated by William Dufris. The Dude Ranger will be greatly appreciated by those who enjoy a good western in the Zane Grey manner."
1,Actually I did not want to give it ANY stars !!!,"This book has no feelings in it. You get no personality from the characters, in fact I totally disliked Wants the Moon. You get no personal thoughts really of the people in the story and don't care what happens to them. The story line could have been very good if you liked anyone in the story, but, ALAS they all are hopelessly stupid and lack any depth what-so-ever !!! I will most assuredly not be buying the sequels :-("
2,Don't Bother With This One,"While this book does offer some useful information, it falls far short of what developers need to understand to develop in ASP.NET. The code examples (which you can download from the publisher's web site)are simply text snippets of code, impossible to run on their own, and less than useful when taken out of context -- very disappointing.There are better books out there that offer much more and better, with complete examples that run. I would not recommend this book."
2,You might fall asleep!!!!,I thought this book would be a good book to read if you were like a young teenage boy but i am a 16 year old girl and i didn't think this book was very good because it was really long and boring and the ending was horrible. I was actually looking forward to the ending but it turns out that that was the worst part of the whole entire book. I wouldn't read this on my spare time!!! If your a young teenage boy and like basketball you might want to read this! Otherwise DON'T!!
2,How do I feel about this book,I think that this book was really boring. I mean the book did not catch my attention and it was not really interesting to me. It was okay but i think that this book should be for younger middle aged kids to read like 12-14. Teenages theses days want to read about more intersting things that excite them. So in my own oppinion i think that the book is for young kids and not teenagers and it was not the best book that i have read
1,this is not a great book,"ok, this book is not the book i actually thought of thinking about.it kept on changing the subject every chapter, and it doesnt keep the story under the book's name which is ""Slam."" i wouldnt recommend this book to anybody my age who are into basketball, cuz its just a waste of time reading a basketball book, that hardly talks about basketball."
4,"This book doesn't just score, it slams!","Slam!, is an excellent book, especially if you are into basketball, but even if you are not, you will still admire this book. Greg Harris, better known as, ""Slam"" goes through some tough situations, both on and off the court. His abilities to play basketball are doubted at first, but once he gets his action, he proves to everyone who the real man on the basketball court is. This book keeps your head in the book from the beggining, I'd recomend it to anyone!"
2,A Fun Read but...come on,"I am in 8th grade and read this book with a group of 3 others.....it was fun to read and discuss with the friends who were also reading it but it wasnt a challenging book and it was hard to read at all....i dunno about all of u who r saying that this was a great book for ur kids to read but if it was they must be stupid....the writing tried too hard to be like a real kid talking....at first i though the kid had two moms....he always said ""My moms..."" This was a fun book to read but wasnt challenging at all"
5,A Great Book about learning life's lessons and playing ball!,I have read the book Slam and I think it is an excellant book for young adults about learning life's lessons while living in the hood. Also if you get into basketball and you understand the game I would aslo recommend it. If you dont understand ball(and with this book you basically have to have a college level understanding of basketball) you shouldnt waste your time reading it. It gives a good perspective on life and is probably the most realistic and down to earth book ive ever read. everything in it is real and it doesnt try to hold back the truth it gives a real life perspective and gives you the facts. The book has some general talk about drugs and the talk about the main character's relationship with women is very explanatory and some of it could be graffic for young readers. It has mild language but other than that it is one of the best books i have read in a long time. if you buy this book i know you will enjoy it very much!
2,NOT SOMETHING TO KEEP MY ATTENTION !!!,I think it is a book more for ages 8-10. This book does not hold the intrest of teenagers.It leaves you hanging at the end.Not a story I would read again.
2,Why I don't like this book,"To be completely honest, I have never read a book by this author until this book. And based on this book, I don't think I will ever again. The book was alright, but I found it very boring at some parts. I'm used to books with a lot more going on in it than what was going on in this book. There wasn't any really exciting parts of this book and for me to like a book, there has got to be some things going on that excite me. I honestly wouldn't recommend this book for anybody who likes books with action and excitement"
2,Klein Rosewood Handle Drop-Point Knife,Knife does not sharpen well. After a period of time the blade has loosened in the handle and can be wiggled.
4,Bra seems fine to me,The bra seems fine and does correct one's posture a little. I wish it were a little padded for modesty. Over all it is fine.
3,not sized correctly,"it seems to be a well made item, however, the lower band is too tight and there is no adjustment. you may consider ordering the next size up."
2,Daughter Not Impressed,"My 15 year old daughter has bad posture so we thought we'd try to correct it by purchasing this bra, as braces and other gadgets are not recommended by doctors. This bra is very lightweight & does not offer enough coverage or support, and my daughter hates it. She has to wear it with another bra to get the coverage and support she needs. The strap design is created to try to remind ladies to stand up straight, but it's not really working for my daughter. Overall, a waste of money for us."
1,What a waste of time,"This book wasn't worth the time I spent ""reading"" it. I use the term sparingly because I forced myself to skim through it to make sure my original assessment was correct. It was. This book isn't worth reading.The ""mystery"" is so thin and overly dramatized. The characters are not at all developed and I still don't really know why the characters wanted to marry.I have not read another Cynster book and I will not based on this one."
2,Disappointed...,"I am a fan of Stephanie Laurens novels, especially the Cynster series, but I was let down with On a Wicked Dawn. Each character had such potential to be far more interesting and far more adventerous. I felt there were more intimate scenes then necessary....we get the point! we WANT the romance!! the chase, the expoloration, the discovery! I felt that this book and it predecessor, On a Wild Night, were lacking."
3,Amelia Cyster's Story,"Although this book is not as good as others in this series it is still worth picking up and giving it a read.Many of the characters from other novels make a re-appreance in this story, and even Lucian's evil brother Edward (you meet in in Amanda's story On A Wild Night) comes back to cause trouble and torment. Amelia has decided that Lucien Ashford is the one for her and nothing is going to stand in her way. Lucian is now in a place where he can consider marriage and is not adverse to marrying Amelia. Conflict comes from neither one of them communicating how they really feel about each other and why they want to marry.Although there is nothing really new in this book it was still entertaining but it did not make it onto my keeper shelf."
4,Silly,"Silly movie from the zombie's perspective. I thought it was cute and I like the different outlook. Sort of corny but cute.Was received very quickly, no problems."
4,good storyline,"Not only a mystery but also involves human relationshipsAs someone previously said, It is similar to the Anne Perry Pitt mysteries"
3,A Treasure,"Imagine my surprise when, while reading ""Treasures,"" I discovered that the green glass bowl handed down from my grandmother to me was a piece of ""Aurene"" from the Steuben Glass Works. And the author's ""tip"" explained why it was not signed. ""Treasures"" is an easy to read, well organized book for beginner and experienced collectors alike. It starts with a look at how the antiques and collectible markets work to value an item. It continues with an interesting glossery of words and phrases associated with pottery, glass, silver, furniture, textiles, paper and more. ""Treasures"" then guides you from room to room teaching you to how recognize often overlooked treasures found in many homes -- and how to put a value on them. Many of the objects are accompanied by simple black and white drawings. I found ""Treasures"" to be an entertaining and educational guidebook."
3,"Good scenery, but a boring Movie.","From reading all the good reviews I expected more. I thought it had potential in the beginning but as time passed I started fast forwarding with about 30 minuets left in the movie. There is some really nice visual footage of the trip to get to Patagonia.There was way too much wimpy little nature girl music throughout the whole Movie.Also it became a real beating to here everyone whine and complain about the rest of the world in the big city, while they were""living their dream"". I guess if your a surfer or a hippie and you don't have any responsibilities and you can just run away from society and have fun till you die then this movie might be right up your alley. We all want to get away from the rat race, and I like people that go on their own personal adventures and film it for us, so I do appreciate the time and effort that went into this movie.....but it was pretty weak all that being said."
2,Super disappointed,"I was a huge fan of Yvon until watching this movie. I'm still impressed by Patagonia's product and customer service, but Yvon has lost his charm for me. Scenery was nice and some historical info was interesting, but the rest was overshadowed by ego and lack of insight."
5,Wow,"Great film, amazing visually, and well put together. Very inspirational with a great twist of humor! The narrators voice is great, calm, I wish he could read me everybook I buy....and I hope he puts out another documentary like this one soon."
5,Great Baking Helper,This is the BEST!! Perfect shape and flexibility. Very sturdy. (floppy end mentioned as a negative by one reviewer is a purposeful design to make it easier to get off the hanging hook if you do hang it up).
4,Very readable,"Simply put. Likeable and interesting characters. Great period of time. Wouldn't call this a high-octane read, but enjoyable. Liked it enough to look into other Anne Perry novels."
3,Review of the basics of Tae Kwon Do,"Hello, well i am a 6 degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and this book is basically what i teach from now, the students pick the movements very fast and understand the way i teach them, because this book is one of the best ever writtencudos to the author!Master Silverton Colorado"
4,Real bright,The bars are a perfect length for the application needed. The multiple patterns are a big plus as well as the contol pad.
5,Excellent kitty!,"Each of my kids has one of these plush cats now. The oldest cat is almost three years old now and has been machine-washed dozens of times when the crud level exceeded the capacity of hand-washing (you know how kids are). As is typical with plush toys, the plush is a little ""crushed"" after washing so many times, but the toy is still attractive and resilient, and my older girl still carries that cat like a talisman. I recently purchased a replacement due to loss, and the new one looks nearly identical to the old one. I'm very pleased. (The original cat turned up several days later, if you're wondering. :) )"
1,A Very Disappointing Glorified Catalogue,Ed Rosenthal's Book of Buds is a Big Book of Bad Bucks. A glorified Catalogue which contains photographs that we have all seen before. You would do just as good to order catalogues (which I already have) from famous seed banks to get the same thing. When I got this book in the post I was shocked to find that Ed had repeated every single picture from the seed catalogues. Not one picture was unique. Not one. So immediately I was very unhappy with this book but then it got worse. The descriptions are not accurate and do nothing to serve the reader with factual useful information. I later learned that Ed Rosenthal got the seed banks to pay him to do this book and he did not grow the strains and has not had any growing experience with most of them. This is the last Ed Rosenthal book I will be buying. This book is proof that Ed is far too overrated as a grower and his lack of experience shows in these writings.
5,Perfect coffee table book.,What a great book. Can't wait for Vol.2!!! Very informative with excellant photography. Highly recommended!
2,Undank,"This is a very mixed bag: a few kind nuggs (e.g., handy icons outlining each strain's characteristics, dj short's palate map) thrown in with much no-love schwag (e.g., bland strain descriptions that after awhile all sound the same, grainy bud photos often lifted straight out of seed catalogs, embarrassing shots of Cannabis Cup proceedings). The book design is amateurish and tacky. I'm sure I will use it as a reference, but not with the same enjoyment I derive from Jason King's Cannabible, which may not contain as much information but is beautiful to look at and so tastefully done."
5,"Thought provoking reading, particularly during Lent",Excellent reading with much to think about. Extremely moving as you read a step by step narrative and follow Jesus to His death on the Cross.
4,JCheezr@aol.com Great Jungle w/ Reggae samples,"If you like ""in your face"" jungle with a reggae flare this one is for you. You can't miss with DJ's like Aphrodite, LTJ Bukem, Remarc and Amazon II lays out a fat track on Bass light. This was one is always being borrowed by friends."
5,Love these mixing bowls,"These are great mixing bowls and are the perfect sizes for my needs, 1 1/2, 3 and 5 quarts. I love OXO products. And they stay put while mixing!! If I have a choice, I usually always go with OXO."
4,good for pressure points,"This is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points. The knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots, but generally does the job."
5,Lonoiz .095 and .110 quiet trimmer line,I tried both sizes for comparison for commercial trimming. Both are durable and cut cleanly without welding. The quietness of the line is greatly appreciated. The line is fairly heavy weight so the .095 diameter works best for me.
2,Truly Lightweight.,"I use this brace while ski racing. It fits over my speed suit. Unfortunately it is sized on the small side and would just barely Velcro together. I should have got a medium instead of going with the sizing charts. Then I pushed on the hinge one day and it snapped in 2 pieces. Turns out the actual hinge is plastic. I will invest in a better built brace to replace this for my stretched CLL tendon. This is really lightweight in performance, buyer beware, I pretty much wasted my money on this one."
3,Pleasant but unmemorable,"There aren't any bad songs on this album, but there are no really great ones either. It tends to just fade into the background, never coming to life and grabbing your attention like the Urge does at their best. ""Receiving the Gift of Flavor"" and ""Master of Styles"" are much more compelling albums."
4,Price is Right,"Connected it to my generator cord, but have not needed generator thus far(that's a good thing). I priced the same item at a local electrical supply outlet and it was almost double. That's a very good thing.David"
5,High quality,"This is a nice, high quality, receptacle. It fits perfectly into my generator inlet and is twist lock so it won't fall out while in use.It's a lot cheaper than buying one at the big box stores!"
5,THE BEST OF HIS P-VINE RELEASES,"I just received this one in the mail it's great, a way better recording than his two other P-Vine recordings, this is all unreleased stuff. It was recorded in 1978, the songs and vocals are classic Smokey, the guitar is also excellent it is well worth buying like all his others, a great collection to have."
1,Not original versions!,"I'm not sure when this CD was released but it certainly is does not contain the original versions. In fact, I'm not even sure it's really Bucks Fizz (it's that bad...). If you've never heard anything by them before, don't buy this CD. If you have heard them before, don't buy this CD. Ick..."
5,sublime european free jazz,"Wonderful DVD of free jazz from 3 gentlemen from central Europe.Ganelin and his pals , all around 60 years old , play with taste and passion their music , clearly inspired in the romantic tradition of european jazz.Piano/synthesizer,saxophones and drums are one perfect combination for this kind of improvised music.Sound and video are crystal clear.Highly recomended for fans of of progresive jazz."
5,Super Service,"Outstanding customer service. My cologne arrived, but it seemed to have leaked a bit (bottle not full). I contacted the seller and they sent a new bottle and had me keep the original as well."
3,FCUK HIM,"Nice fragrance, soft, mild yet long lasting. Its not a pungent masculine cologne. I would recommend its use for everyday at daytime in the summer."
4,"A solid origin story, great for 1st-2nd graders","My wife and I are doing everything we can to encourage our 7-year-old to read, and since he loves Batman Beyond, this book was a natural choice. The book tells the origin of ""Batman Beyond"" effectively, if very sketchily. It is presented in comic book (or maybe graphic novel) format, and the artwork is solid, standard, comic book style art.Although the book is supposed to be targeted for children 4-8 years old, I'd narrow that range to 6-8. Your average first grader will have a bit of difficulty with many of the words.The strongest recommendation I can make for this book is that my son read the entire book on his own initiative without any prompting or encouragment from us. That was the first time he ever read a book completely on his own, so needless to say, I'm thrilled."
5,Cool movie for the whole family,"I first saw ""Smart house"" on the Disney Channel and loved it. I do admit it took me a while to decide if I wanted to record it but I finally did. But I also purchased the DVD from the Disney online store. My mom, brother and I enjoyed it. It might seem boring to some, so I suggest you rented first to see it or wait till it comes on the Disney channel but for me, I loved it. It's so awesome to see the cool features the house has. I just wished they showed more."
1,utter crap,"The item's screws were stripped and failed to turn when pressure was applied. The thing couldn't cut through butter let alone a gold ring. In the end, we took it apart attached the bit to a dremel tool and cut the rings off that way. (watch out it gets hot and don't try this unless you know what you're doing). Had I known, I would have just gone to the jewelers in the first place, rather than wasting time waiting for this piece of crap."
5,amazing,"When I bought the Grace ep's from which this album is one of 5 I first played this album and still it's my favourite.The interaction with his audience, the way Jeff puts his soul into his music, it gets to you. A true Jeff buckley fan can't let this one slip!"
3,Pearl Jam Exposed,"I bought this item in Paris last june, when I was there for a Pearl Jam concert! The carton box is really cool! If you thought this was an interview disc, well, I'm sorry, it isn't. It's the Pearl Jam story told by some woman, and deals with some of the important issues of the Pearl jam history. You will hear some snippets of interviews, but in overall it's the woman telling. This item is a direct ripp-off of another Pearl Jam disc, ""Maximum Audio Pearl Jam"", only the length is shorter.Though, for every real Pearl Jam fan it is really cool to have, and the carton box with the cool Eddie Vedder Picture on the disc is really worth the sale!It's nice for Pearl Jam collector's!"
1,I Could Only Manage Two Listenings,"I bought this when it was first released and could only listen to it twice (painfully).I don't know, or care, where the CD is now..."
4,It rekindle a lot of old memories,My husband loves this cd. He has been looking for it for over a year now.
4,Classic karate,"Probably what you would consider a classical work of karate. Written in the 50's era, it covers most of what is known about karate. The only real down side is only basic kicks are illustrated. It is not a particularly violent book, but, I would not recommend it for children."
5,A very informative book,"This is a great book for any student who is trying to polish their techniques a bit. Nishiyama's book is loaded with all the information you would need to refine your skills. It's rather lacking in historical and philisophical information (two things I enjoy studying and don't think any karate book is complete without), but it's nonetheless an excellent aid for practice."
5,A must for all serious practioner of Karate,This book should be considered a bible to all martial artist and students who are serious about studying the Japanese Style karate. It is very informative and still up to date. As an Instructor I find this book as a great source of reference.
5,Perfectly nice handle,"It is just like it looks, or maybe even prettier! Plus it is nice, heavy metal."
1,CRAP,"This is NOT a chess timer, it has no second hand, and no indicator of when time runs out. I don't know what this is for, but do NOT buy it."
3,Using Multiethnic literature in the k-8 classroom,I felt that this book was very informative. It was very helpful in understanding the material discussed in class. This book teaches about the many different interests of children and how to get them involved in reading. The author also included useful information about our diverse society and how we can influence our children to respect and understand those who are not of the same race or culture.
4,it was a good movie,I liked the movie but i expected Jennifer lopez to be in it a little more.She has a very small part in this movie.
5,The meaning of life,"Suryavan showed me the priorities of life: to succeed in material, emotional, mental and spriritual levels, reaching the top of the inner mountain.Teached me the importance of working in a team inside a personal growth school. This book is only a door to excelence."
2,For sales people,"This book seems to be very similar to the Dale Carnegie's best seller, How to make friends and influence people. Nothing wrong with it, that book has a public and is very well received in the world of sales people.Now, as a spiritual book, it is quite far from anything with a real depth. For people who like the ""How to"" books, trying to get a shortcut to enlightenment, it is okay but for people with a little level of maturity, it will be disappointing."
5,Challenging Conventional Wisdom,Lee and Mangen have produced a study that challenges conventional wisdom and offers solid facts and evidence of changing customer paradigms. Well done.
4,Unique Perspective,"It is said that ""Perception is everything"". I believe that ""Perspective is everything"". Cozzens offers a unique perspective and reflections on a much discussed topic today. I learned about 5 things that I did not realize before from which I can develop my own ideas."
4,Good read,"Eventhough I loved Miranda and Ryan, I was actually more hooked with Miranda's brother Andrew and Annie. I wished Ms. Roberts wrote more about them. They looked so good together. She was his rock through it all.As for the story, it was intriguing...a fine and proper scientist found herself being partnered with an art thief to solve a case which endangered her credibility. A good read indeed."
3,Not one of my Nora Robert's favorites,"I loved SANCTUARY and MONTANA SKY, but I found HOMEPORT to be a major disappointment. There was just something off about the pacing. From the very first scene, it was difficult to get a handle on what the book was supposed to be ABOUT. I'm giving it 3 stars because Ms.Robert's actual writing was excellent as usual. It was simply the story structure and pacing that struck an off-key note with me."
3,I like Nora Roberts but..,"I bought this for my Kindle because, well it is Nora Roberts. She does nice stories that don't beat you to death with the romance in them. But I was kind of disappointed in this one. The character development is not as good as usual, and the plot is very Danielle Steele. I will still keep reading Roberts, especially when she writes under the name J.D. Robb, but this is not one of her best."
1,disgusting,"Beautiful music as you might expect, interspersed sporadically with loud male voices that sound somewhat like hog calling.It is hard to believe that a recording company (director?) could be so stupid"
1,Buyer Beware,"This book does NOT have illustrations of Alexander Calder's work. It has sketchy, cartoonish drawings done in red pencil. Nothing inspiring about this book. Doesn't do the sentiments in the song justice. Definitely not a keeper."
5,Love it,Love this item and it is just what I was looking for! I am very pleased. This is going to be a great gift for my Dad. Delivery was fast as well.
3,Too Drawn Out,"This, so far is my least favorite of the series though i am only in the middle of book four right now. The maze of satan was hardly interesting to read about and the timeline moves way too fast while Niobe is clotho. The only part that was really cool was the part with mars and the samurai. Still, if you are going to read the others, this has some very important plot points to the rest of the series. overall it wasn't a bad book but i was glad to see that the 4th book, so far anyway, is more like the first book and less like this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Husband stands in on wife's killing, she becomes part of Fate.A woman's husband learns that she will die, and arranges that he will instead. She discovers later that this is a plot of that evil Satan bloke.The Fates are a tripartite entity, and she gives up the first job, and is invited to the next after spending some time as a mortal again. This repeats, as she gets involved with stopping S*tan plots."
3,"Great book, poor translation to Kindle","I read these books many years ago and wanted to re-read them.I've read the first two and am now about 3/4 the way through the third (this one - ""With A Tangled Skein"").I'm enjoying the books as much as I did many years ago, BUT - This one seems to have a large number of typo's. Multiple typo's per chapter. I have the original paperback (yes, I bought a kindle version even though I have it in paperback - I just prefer reading things on Kindle!) so I've checked and the problem is NOT in the original book.I find it odd since ""On a Pale Horse"" and ""Bearing an Hourglass"" did not have this problem. I'm guessing it is a poor scan from book to Kindle and Amazon never had anyone proof-read the scanned copy before making it available for sale.Come on, Amazon - you're better than that.3 stars due to the bad scanning - otherwise it's still one of my favorite book series and I'd recommend it.- Ron Donofero"
4,See Warrren. See Warren invest.,"This book has some good ideas that basically just boil down on a relatively surface level how to invest in value. What I found a little weird were moments where it read like a Dick & Jane book. I don't know how many times I read phrases like ""Warren likes this company because..."" or ""Warren doesn't like this company because..."". Don't get me wrong, it's good, practical stuff. I was just waiting for them to throw in something like... ""See Warren. See Warren review the 10-K for Coca Cola. See Warren buy 10,000 shares of Coca Cola. Can you buy 10,000 shares of Coca Cola?"""
2,Very little NEW useful information,"This book does not offer anything new in relation to investing techniques than in the original 'buffettology' (to be fair, the original 'buffettology' was an excellent book).The only useful information I found is on the latest acquisitions by Berkshire Hathaway (or its subsidaries, such as Geico).Also, I don't believe all the acquisitions mentioned in the book were made personally by Mr Warren Buffett himself, investment decisions in Geico are made by Mr Lou Simpson.Better save your money by borrowing it from the nearby public library."
2,Nothing really new here,"The title of this book is a misnomer because the content is really not particularly new or fresh. Readers might buy this, or the previous Buffettology book by the authors, but one's investment knowledge base is not significantly enhanced by the two books in tandem."
3,Taking sailing to the edge,"This book takes portions of other books, a chapter or so, and collects them here so you can taste from many offerings. The editor chooses people sailing on the edge, racing or voyaging, generally single handed.After reading these, I want to stay in my living room. You could have titled this ""How to be miserable in a boat and survive."" Yes, it's incredible what can be accomplished (withstood?) but not many people would want to. The comraderie and beauty of sailing are not often found here.One the other hand, if you like stories of single handing through miserable conditions at the edge of physical and psychological limits, you will love this selection."
5,Better then the Cynster series,I've read and enjoyed all the Cynster books and can say that Ms Laurens writing has evolved over time. This was a read in a day and half book. I couldn't put it down. The characters are strong and worthwhile.
3,Hipper than usual regency drama,"This author is a very good writer of dialog and is a whole lot hipper than most other novelists in this genre. I felt like I was here and now in 2003, listening to 1800s dialog with a current vibe to it. It made reading very cool.The skullduggery in this complex plot is capable of producing a few heart pounding moments more commonly experienced in Stephen King novels, etc. I liked this a lot.My one dissonant note and why I gave only 3 stars is that Ms. Laurens writes gross out sex scenes. The ripe imagry created in one intimate interlude between Ella and Tristan was utterly vulgar. This is my first look at this author and I hope that this aforementioned blunder will not appear in her other romance novels. No woman wants to find herself viewed by her lover this way. Read the story, you'll find out."
2,stalker,"I'm returning this, having read to the halfway point. The hero is a stalker, plain and simple. The book starts out in an interesting fashion, then bogs down and becomes very irritating when he thinks no doesn't mean no. Well, actually he apparently knows it means no, but that's immaterial to him, because he plans on getting what he wants regardless of the heroine's feelings."
5,The One Minute Millionare,"When the student is ready the teacher will appear. I found this book to be unique in that it's really two books in one. more times than I can count I've had ideas but not the resources in which to impliment them. I had not thought of networking with in my own circle of friends. I bought 10 of these books and gave them to frends and family. No one should miss the intro to this book. Their purpose for writting it is very commendable.It's an easy read no matter how you learn. It's also in line with other books I've read such as Think and grow rich, grow rich now and getting rich by the book. Did I like it? loved it!"
3,Some Of It Is Not Real,"An 'ok' book. Just 'ok'. Some of the wealth acquisition strategies are straight out unreal! Especially when he talks about the real estate strategies to wealth - unreal! A lot of repetition. Too many exhausted concepts. It's like he was running out of things to say. However, a FEW great ideas."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!,The book is a mere rehashing of everything we've heard for the past 20 years or more about creating wealth--NOTHING NEW HERE. It has simply been repackaged by two very shrewd businessmen with EXTREMELY QUESTIONABLE ETHICS.DON'T BE TAKEN IN!!!
3,Some very good points,"This book can change your life. It teaches some very important and useful priciples. Very good reading.It was after reading the book that was a letdown. What I didn't care for was the hard sell at the website, and the aftermarket hype about the expensive ""advanced courses."" They were elusive about the prices and terms of the aftermarket sales. Too much snake oil for me.Overall though, a very good read and good basic formula for creating wealth. Create multiple income streams, then write a book about it, and sell expensive seminars."
4,A great read for changing your life for the better!,"This is a great book. It is very similar in style to the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret' in that the learning points are woven around a heartwarming story.The story itself is easy to follow and inspiring with great practical tips for not just making money but for improving your life in many other ways. The only thing I would change is to have the practical teaching element at the end of the book, rather than placed alongside the story. Other than that, highly recommended."
1,Not prepared as an ebook,This book has two stories writen at the same time. In the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. But this is all lost in the Kindle and its very complicated to follow the story. I can not uderestand how they dare to sell a product not propared to be used properlly by its readers.
3,One Minute Millionaire review,"For ""One Minute..."" this book is just too long. If the authors can't say their piece in less than 50 pages, they ought to retitle the book, take a writing class, or hire me to do it for them. Lord knows I can do a better job.Some concepts are worth noting, the rest are just the same 'ole, new-age, pop psychology mantras.Book shipped fairly promptly, but unfortunately, the high shipping cost effectively neutralized the savings off retail."
3,Problem,"It did not come in a case, like all the other DVD's I order from Amazon, it it came in paper sleeve, which adds no protection a case has.I would not recommend ordering from this person, for the above reasons."
3,Maybe a little more Bubble Wrap,"The product was exactly as described and was delivered quickly, so was extremely happy with that; however the case was broken in a number of places and we were worried the discs would not work as they had a few scratches on them. So maybe a bit more bubble wrap when sending the product."
4,Cast iron wok,"For Christmas i got a cast iron wok... which was really exciting. However, I don't cook a with Asian flavors, though i wanted to learn. So i ordered this book to get an idea of what flavors other than soy sauce and sesame oil there were. I was pleased to discover that this book goes into extensive detail about so MANY ingredients it kinda makes your head spin with possibilities. So I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start out learning Asia's copious amount of yummy tasting ingredients."
5,Two Folks Who Are Talented and Funny,"What a treat to hear songs by Eddie and Martha Adcock up here in the frozen north coast of Alaska. Really warm up our mornings....not to metion evenings where we have dancers of all types, including traditional Inupiat Eskimo Dancers. We have many races here in Barrow, but all enjoy good music.Eddie and Martha play with such feeling.....and simplicity....but yet their rich blends and character come through.They could both be members of a larger group, but choose to remain a couple, and travel around singing and raising everyone's spirits, and also bring smiles to everyone in the audience. I hope we can see them in person someday in our remote area."
5,One of the best books I've read in quite awhile.,"This book is easily the best book I've read in some time. I tore threw it in a few hours unable to put it down, indeed I was late to work due entirely to this book's ability to capture the reader."
4,A fun debut,"I've read my share of WWII spy novels, including some by the masters of the genre (Follett, Deighton, etc.). This novel shows the potential of a great author.Altman is not quite there yet, and maybe he never will be. Only future books will tell. This book is good, however. You do not expect deep thoughts from a work like this, just good entertainment, and he pays off.Why not five stars? Because there are still things that need to be worked on. In particular, the ending seems a bit abrupt and depends on a slight deus ex machina to save a principal character (to avoid spoilers, I say no more on this). Also, the two story lines could mesh together better.In the end, however, this one is worth reading and I anticipate reading more Altman in the future."
3,Altman's debut thriller is quite average..,"John Altman's debut thriller is a spy story set in the midst of World War II. Two very unlikely spies converge when the German ""sleeper"" awakes when she discovers the Manhattan Project while she is a physicist's wife in New Mexico. She then decides to go to England to find her former superior, who is now a double agent for Britain. At the same time, a college professor whose wife is in a German concentration camp is called into service for England. His mission is to infiltrate the Germans by acting like a defector with some security secrets. The two first clash in London where the German spy manages to take down about 12 people singlehandedly. Some parts of the book really strain creduality, and both of the spies seem a bit flat as characters. A good way to pass some time however"
3,It's okay,"I have had this watch for less than two months now. I have had to adjust the time on it twice for no known reason, maybe it's time for a new battery. It is a nice looking watch though, leather strap gets a little uncomfortable/hot at times because the skin underneath does not get a chance to breathe. The pin to adjust the time and date is sensitive, but still okay as an everyday watch."
5,Thank you,I am so glad to have received it. It is rare and I've been looking for it for years. It came in a timely manner and in the condition that was stated when I bought it. I highly recommend this seller.
1,DO NOT BUY OR USE THIS PRODUCT!,"A few hours after using this product, my cat was foaming at the mouth and got sick. I washed it off of her along with live fleas. I can't believe this product is allowed to be sold. Please do not use this product. It will make you pet sick! I wish I would have read all the reviews ""before"" I used it!"
1,THIS STUFF IS POISON! BURNED ANIMALS SKIN!,"Horrible stuff! Burned BOTH my cats skin & I have worked with animals for 15 years, know how to apply properly. I have NEVER seen a product do this to an animal before. Next morning both cats were itching & scratching even more than ever....poor guys were trying to soothe their burns. They were both lethargic the next day, slept WAY more than usual, the younger cat did not eat all day which is unheard of! By day 3 the skin was bright purple & skin was actually flaking off. When I called my vet the 1st question she asked was ""did you use PurrScriptions?"". It's happened to other people...WHY TAKE THE RISK IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET? WHY do you think it's on sale????"
1,Awful - stay away,"I wish I had read these reviews beforehand. I bought this and put it on my 1.5 year old cat, and she immediately started darting around, scratching uncontrollably, and trying to shake the product off. Needless to say, I bathed her right away with dawn dish soap (since product is oil based)to get it all off. Her ears turned bright red and she became very hot. Luckily, it's been a few hours since I washed it off, and she seems to be doing much much better.Stay away, whatever you do. This stuff is awful."
1,Could it be any more Boring,"While, after five books, there is finally the potential of a relationship between Alex ""Blondie"" Cooper and Detective Mike, this book was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring! I had to struggle to finish it. The whole plot with the museum was boring. I live in NYC and visit the museums frequently but this just did not hold my interest."
2,They Should Take Their Own Advice,"At least one of the people associated with this book didn't read the book she is supposed to be praising. The entry on INFINITE JEST is jammed with errors, errors that no one who has given the novel even a cursory reading would make. Shame on them."
1,Overrated,"This album along with the talent of this band is completely overrated. They have successfully tried to politicize their views giving them much needed attention. Now back to the music. Album recording is poor, singing is like listening to Nurse Ratchet. I think this band needs a new direction and should start fresh with something else. Care factor of what the Chicks think!? 0!!!!!! There is your fair and balanced review."
1,A Voice that doesn't hold up,"Maines voice doesn't carry well in live venues. Without studio magic, Maines' voice sounds nasally and unimpressive. It's clear she doesn't have the pipes of a Martina McBride or a Tricia Yearwood.This offering lacks the spunk that the band has marketed itself with in the past. All in all, it's not like Johnny at San Quentin or Garth live.This CD shows the limits of hype. The Chicks, not to be confused with real songwriters, give lackluster performances live. This collection shows that the songs aren't their own. It might as well be a demo album with stock cheering added.Hype suggested that the Chicks had crafted a career that would last for decades. This collection does much to refute the early promise.Who knows? Maybe after falling off the Earth, Branson will discover them in thirty years."
3,Bad recording,The Chicks and band are fabulous but it's difficult to tell on this recording. Sounds as though someone in the audience set up two cheap mics and recorded onto a portable DAT machine. Terrible!And this from a group that has consistently released sonically supurb records. What happened?
2,Pretty monotonous to a newcomer,"Having never heard any Dixie Chicks music, and after reading several glowing reviews, I spent the $13 to buy this set. I am a huge Alison Krauss fan, and a moderate country music fan in general, so I was curious. I was completely disappointed. Speaking as a total newcomer, these cds are pretty monotonous and boring. Virtually all of the vocals are shouted/screamed out, there is no modulation, no ""quiet"" moments, and it all sounds like the same song, just periodically broken up by a few seconds of what sounds like canned audience screaming. The backup band is bland, all blending into one. After a while, it seems like that scene in the film Groundhog Day, where Bill Murry wakes up to the same song every day. This is simply a display of mediocre talent. For real talent and virtuosity, pick up the new live album from Alison Krauss and Union Station."
5,Fabulous,"This CD is incredible. I can't believe they sound so good live. Not sure how ""Faith"" from Austin, TX can be so critical of the Dixie Chicks. Just because she is a Republican, it doesn't mean she has to criticize them. I am really tired of people saying they do not like the Dixic Chicks because of their political views. I could care less what they believe in politically, I like them because they are unbelievably talented and gifted women. They will continue to have much success in the future. And Faith, stick to politics and not music!"
2,OK...doubt the 'Destined to be a cult classic' claim,"This is a sometimes humorous film for those familiar with all the facts surrounding UFOs, abduction lore. Production values OK. Acting adequate. I was not very impressed with this film."
2,Juniebjomes,It was very very very very ........ stupid because I never herd of the series before in my whole.life so
2,Factually wrong,It would be better if Barbara Parks stays away from History and other factual areas. Better if the books are kept primarily to day to day activities and emotions/ feelings thereof. These are Barbara Parks' strengths. When looking for starter chapter books I mistakenly bought the whole collection for my daughter. The repeated use of spelling and grammar errors was too much for me but my daugther seems to like these books than the other much better ones I bought (magic tree house). Anyway when I read to her I make sure I read MTH :-).Apart from the grammar issues this particular book has a very glaring factual error. Columbus was trying to find a sea route to enable Iberia to gain speed in the spice trade (East Indies). The book says he was trying to find a route to China!! Please stay away from facts is my hope.
1,William Strunk rolls over in his grave,"OK. I may not consistently turn out elegant prose myself, but there is a line. This book has crossed it. Opening the book at random:page 64: ""And me and Sheldon and May...."" ""...too bad for me. On account of May sailed way too speedy.""page 65: ""I couldn't even stay in my seat that good.""I understand that some authors phrase dialogue to convey dialect, et cetera. However, the audience for this book is kids who are still learning how to both speak and read the language. Learning awful grammar will not help them succeed."
1,Very Disappointed Faulty out of the box,"I should have believed other reviewers.. this product is low quality ... brand new out of sealed box and would not pump up and develop pressure to shoot. Tried many times thinking it needed a little working, but never more than a slight puff. Also found the bolt action very very stiff... no way a child could use."
5,Great Gun for the Money,"For the money this is a great gun. You get good mid range gun, a scope, safety glasses, targets, and ammo. I had no problem mounting the scope and getting it dialed in so I could shoot tight groups in the black at 30 feet. The scope is just fine and it was clear and bright. All you have to do is read the instructions on how to set it up and how to get it focused in. I think the people who complained didn't follow the instructions.Remember this is not a high end gun and neither is the scope but for under 100 dollars its one nice combination that is accurate and fun. I had nor problem hitting small spinner targets from over 50 feet as well.I did find the Gamo pellets to be more accurate than the included crossman pellets.Have fun plinking!!!"
5,A great new find in female sleuthing!,"I had been reading library copies of Lucille Kallen's C.B. Greenfield series and was disappointed to find that ones I couldn't get at the library are out of print. But ""Exiles on Main Street,"" by Lisa Kleinholz, is more than a worthy successor. Ms. Kleinholz's heroine is quirkier and more believable, and the variety of people she deals with are more relevant, than those in the earlier books, which were also set in New England. I think her book will also appeal to mystery readers who are in their early 30s (most female sleuths these days seem to be somewhat older, which I, at my advanced age, happen to like, even though I liked this one for her off-beat view of life). I'd like to read more--find out does her husband adjust to small-town life, can she become friends with the liberal element of the town, will she be able to find more stories to sell to Rolling Stone, etc."
5,The Enchanted Palace!,"In addition to the excellent photos and detailed brief description of the Alhambra and the Generalife, this sixty-nine page book contains other information such as a map of the palace, and of the Generalife garden. It is a great book for anyone who plans to visit this Last Stronghold of the Moors in Spain, or just to remember its enchanted halls, and courts. If you have never been there, this book is a good starting point. You will fall in love with its decorative details, towers, gardens, and pools. The Alhambra is a very romantic and peaceful place. Excellent for students and tourists. However, tales of the Alhambra are found in other books."
1,Let me get this Straight...,"I'm getting freakin' annoyed at the people who think KoRn is talented... Check out Children of Bodom (they're in their 20's...). And to the reviewer who said Slayer never lived...HAHAHAHAHA! Kerry King is a great guitarist. And to that other reviewer who think they spawned all this nu-metal crap...HAHAHAHAHA! Give that horrid honor to Helmet - those annoyances (Who did solos...). And, on the talent issue, listen to the way they they play their guitars - three frets at a time, very slowly, like a child expressing their first curiosity in the use of the guitar. And to those who say, ""They don't play as fast as Mudvayne...,"" again, check out Slayer, or, better yet, Children of Bodom. And, Slayer is Still Alive & well, you nincompoop. I bet that the person who said ""Send a demo tape to Roadrunner Records"" doesn't even know how to play an instrument (Rock-Oriented). LONG LIVE MUSIC!!!"
2,Sad Attempt to Reverse a Trend,"The latest album from KoRn does have it's heavier sides, as Davis finally remembers how to yell (after 2 albums of being a sellout), but that doesn't compensate for the trend that KoRn has been continuing.With this album, I'd like to be hopeful to say that they are pulling away from the Untouchables junk (which they are), but I cannot transgress what they did with Follow the Leader and the previous 2 albums and say that Korn has come a long way.The fact of the matter is that Korn was a kickass band, but has now been desensitized, spayed, and neutered all over the past 2 albums. Take a Look in the Mirror does exactly just that, but the fact of the matter is that Korn is just looking at an Michael Jackson-like face and saying that he can still sing ""Thriller."" It can't be done, so just keep purchasing the first 3 albums and wait for a Greatest Hits CD."
3,Heavy but OK,This albumm is alright its missing alot of stuff... ALIVE (demo version) is way better than the one on this album. I dont know korn just went down but they are getting back up from untouchables brutal crapola ... Work harder... but it would be awesome if korn made a thrash cd or a hardcore punk cd (listen to jingle balls or X mas song by Korn to know what im saying)...
3,same same same,"i bought this record because i have all the other ones and i heard ""right now"" on the radio and thought it was pretty good. so, when i first listened to it, i couldn't really tell one song from the other without looking at my disc-man. it all sounded the same. i don't mind because i like their sound. if you're a big fan of korn, then you'll like this record, but if you're listening to korn for the first time, then try one of thier previous ones."
4,Heavy Korn has resurfaced.,"This was a step back to ""Follow the Leader"" days. Some of their heaviest stuff is on this album. ""Right Now"" may be the angriest song they have ever made. ""Did My Time"" is one of my favorite Korn songs. ""Y'all Want A Single"" is a fun, f-bomb flinging romp. ""Play Me"" is a rap-rock masterpiece. If you liked their early music, this should help satisfy your appetite for heavy Korn music. I hope their new one (Summer '07) is heavier too."
4,people are stupid.....but not korn,"... all in all the album is good, nothing like the old stuff, but good indeed"
4,Much better,"This is a two Cd booklet. One is the Cd itself, the other a Dvd of bonus features.The Cd is one of if not Korns Best so far. Its a harder and more Raw sound than their previous albums. Much better than untouchables. All the songs are emotional and sound very real, like they are played live.its just great, if you like anything by Korn, go buy this."
2,Not that good,"OK I just want to clarify something. Glo DNHR wrote a really stupid statement. He said he didn't like Play Me becuz Korn could didn't get somebody bigger than Nas to feature in it. First off, Nas is fairly well known. Second, GLo, you are dumb if u think what makes a song good is who you can get to feature in it. What's good is the music. Korn has too many guests on their songs and not enough talent. Btw, this album has two good songs, ""Did My Time"" and ""Counting on Me"". The rest is not super. I really don't like Korn much but they do have some good songs scattered on different albums. Buy Untouchables, it is the only halfway decent album with no crappy bagpipes or weird noises *cough*Twist."
1,"WHATEVER U DO, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM","korn USED to be a great band. they began goin downhill on untouchables and have'nt stopped. this nu-metal ""i hate you"" blah blah blah and ""i hate everything else"" blah blah blah is getting really old. i mean, grow the hell up, how can these multi-millionaires possibly relate to the music they r putting out. maybe they used to relate to it (hence to first couple albums) but these munkies need to grow some brains and write some decent new material. just listen to the first track, ""shutup,clsoe your mouth etc etc etc"", here is a tissue jonathan now please go kill yourself. Save the money, buy a really big bat, and go to the record store and smash all copies of this album."
2,Not the Korn I know,"think ther's a point when a band have to retire. It's not the time for KoRn but I think these guys should take some rest. Releasing albums every year for the pleasure of relese them is not healthy for a band that has been recycling old ideas and sounds and trying to make'em sound fresh during the last years.I own the first two albums and they're great. Follow the leader is okey but I get tired and sold it. The next attempts to make something good desilutionated me. This is the case of Take a look back in the mirror. First, check the CD cover: Isn't it similar to the Life is peachy album? Yes. The really heavy music that make self-titled album a kick in the ass is gone. Tthe lyrics are stupid and the screams sound weak in comparation with Daddy or Kill you (in the Life is Peachy CD), true demostrations of inspired singing.Yeah guys, you should take a rest. When you feel ready join together, breath deeply and do what you are good to: play heavy music."
3,"Nothing new, but enough to piss everyone at work off with!!!","Korn ""10"" If you buy a Korn CD this is the one to buy first ""REALLY BUY THIS ONE FIRST"", Peachy ""10"" lot's of hate here. Follow the leader ""9.5"" Nice and rude ""still"" Korn, Issue's ""-1.5"" This CD is crap, Untouchable's ""2"" first song is the best all else are SNOREZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZ. Look in the mirror is a good CD. So far after about 4 days of constant replay I give it a solid ""6"". I've followed Korn since my Navy service started in 93. Everyone wanted to know WHO I was listening to. Now everyone wants to know if the next cd is any good. And as you can tell by my own rating's the first 3 are what I call a happy buy's, as I love money I would sincerely tell you to buy the 1st 3. skip the next two and go ahead and pick up the latest KORN CD as it dosen't suck. Let me say this, if your drunk as me and my shipmates usually are we pick up THE ORIGIANL KORN FIRST then Peachy/leader/and Mirror!!!!!"
3,"Good Stuff, but repeative from previous albums","This album is a good piece from Korn, being a fan from the first 2 albums and owning and only hearing the first three(and this). Borrowed riffs from previous albums and other main over done riffs. They have their own sound for the most part, but for instance in 'Right Now' - opening riffs sounds sim to opening for follow the leader's 'It's on' and 'reclaim my place' Break some off uses styles from Peachy's 'Swallow', i'm sure there is plenty to comment on but i havn't listened to korn in a while. As for people who say this is the heaviest thing they ever heard should listen to The Crown's Possessed 13 a killer thrash album...But anyway, it's still a good listen if your in a mellow/heavy mood"
1,damn man,"i have liked korn since the begining, and now this...all i have to say if you think korn kept getting worse(not bad, youd just rather listen to the old albums) then its not for you; the only disapointing thing is in the credits fieldy said that this is the korn sound, sorry korn but yall hit rock bottom and fell in a hole, :("
2,"Good, but not....","From an enginneering stand-point, the album is well produced, the mix is awesome....but from a fan's point of view, I hate it. I only like 2 songs off the whole album, and I can hear those on the radio. I've been a fan of Korn forever as most people will say the same, their style is just going down and further down. Where's the excitement of the first 3 albums? I don't get excited by listening to their music anymore, I don't get that fist-clenching feeling I used to. The fact of the matter is, Korn will continue to search new musical styles (much like the Deftones) and their albums will always sell, because their name sells. They have millions of fans still and as soon as one of their new records hits the shelves, those fans will run out and buy it, take the first listen and say it's the best album Korn has ever done. Their songs just have no content anymore. Hope this helps some of these stuck-on Korn fans evolve and branch out into other music. PEACE!"
3,It's OK if you want a single,"OK lets face it Korn has had better days. Their newest album is nothing compared to the older releasings of Korn. There are about 4 or 5 really good songs off the album and the rest are mostly filler songs to complete the album. I enjoyed it for the 1st listening, but after that it got boring. It's worth buying if you are a true Korn fan, but if you don't own a Korn album get Follow The Leader, their best album"
1,Take a look in the mirror and break it.,"In this flatfooted cd by korn, duller songs (except for one and the one with nas), stupidier drum playing and awful singingthey should have called ittake a look and get out of the mirrorOne StarKorn's deadPick up their first two albumsDEATH TO FALSE METAL!"
4,second best album ever,is one of their best albums korn is getting betterright now self titlebreak some off life is peachycounting on me issueshere it comes again life is peachydeep insde untouchablesdid my ime untouchableseverything i've known untouchablesplay me follow the leaderalive selt titlelet's do this now self titleim done untouchablesy'all want a single life is peachywhen will this end self titlethe best songs in the album are right now y'all want a single let's do this now break some off counting on me
2,Well... At Least its better than that crap heap Untouchables,"This album does have some good parts to it, they tried to return to their old heavier style, but failed; not miserably, but I doubt they'll ever be able to return to the gods they once were. Untouchables was terrible, but this isn't much better.If you want a REAL metal classic, buy The Crown's new CD, Possessed 13. It's way more extreme than this will ever be."
2,This CD depresses me,"This album isn't that horrible or unlistenable. But Korn has produced much better. Johnathan sounds like he is losing his voice and some of the songs have a kind of sketchy sound to them. I am a big fan of Korn's older heavier stuff. It would be awesome if they could bring it back, but it seems to not be working for them.This CD has a few good moments but I would'nt recommend buying it, unless it was on sale or used. A good album to download too, but then the poor record company executives would have to sell one of thier Ferraris or condo in Aspen just to make ends meet."
2,You guys are nuts,"This is by far Korn's worst album to date. Nowhere near as creative as their old stuff, and nowhere near as listener-friendly as Issues or Untouchables. Every song is basically the same, with very little diversity, and I swear they're trying to set a record for reusing the same expletive as many times as possible on a single album. The only songs even remotely good are the two radio songs, Right Now and Did My Time, and they're nothing amazing. Korn diehards might like it, but as someone who does in fact own all of their albums, I was very much let down. Just because Korn did it, doesn't automatically make it gold. And that NAS song is an embarassment."
1,When will this all end?,"This is probably the worst KoRn cd that they ever made. Untouchables is better than this. I don't think its just me but after Follow The Leader KoRn has produced horrible and uninteresting cds for almost a decade. The only track I like on this cd is Did My Time, the only song really worth listening to. I agree with the Velvet Revolver guy, they are pretty much the only interesting band that is out today (VR). I can't belive KoRn are still around, and its been only 10 years? Well, Life is Peachy wasn't that great either I guess the only Korn cd i can listen to is there self-titled, and I barely listen to that either. Please Korn call it quits in the future, or at least break up because your music isn't going anywhere..."
1,Take a look in the toilet,"This is not old Korn. I still have the first Korn CD in the changer, its been there for about 3 years, along with the first Rage Against the Machine. Both bands do very little for me after their first releases. Thats where all the genious is. I give one star to this album because I do feel slightly more afraid by Korn yelling ""Shut up, shut up, shut up I'll mess you up"" than I do by Linkin Park yelling ""Shut up when Im talkin to you!"" both verses are so passionate and so much thought went into them, that I tend to tremble when I hear them. If your giving this piece of crap five stars, then you also have the new Metallica and a poster of Evanescence on your wall, and you've never even heard of the band Anthrax, without which these idiots would not have a job."
2,"""Take a Look in the Mirror"" -- Waste of a CD","Although I'm not a die-hard fan of Korn, I like a lot of their music. This CD, however, was TERRIBLE! A couple of songs were alright but IT ALL SOUNDS THE EXACT SAME!!! Is that even legal to produce a CD like that? Anyone with a brain would skip this CD, and go buy a case of beer with the money they would save. If you want to hear one or two of the songs, get the greatest hits... you'll be better off that way."
5,Hot Album,"This is a great album. Includes the hit singles, ""Did My Time"", ""Right Now"", and ""Ya'll Want a Single"". My favorite song on this album is ""Play Me"" featuring Nas. I love rap music, and usually would not buy a heavy metal album (I got it because a heavy-metal-head friend told me Nas was on it; didn't believe him before buying it). This was a highly decent album. Korn and Nas should collaborate again and make a full album of their big songs like Jay-Z and Linkin Park did."
1,koRn is going commercial,"I am a huge Korn fan but this album sucks. The whole cd seems like it was made for MTV. I am very dissapointed in this album and if you are a real Korn fan, especially the early stuff, I would say stay away from this CD."
2,Nowhere near Korn's potential,"I was really anxious to buy this album, but I was really dissapointed with it. I'm a huge KoRn fan and I was one of the few people who liked Untouchables, but on this album they completely changed their sound, and it doesn't sound good at all.The band said that they were going back to their roots with this album, but they definitely didn't come close to topping their self titled debut, which is by far their best. Now I don't know if I still like them."
4,great!!!!!!,"Korn are back, although i say they never left, others disagree.This album is by far the best album they've had since life is peachy, although rushed, the turnout is incredible."
4,For those of you who dissed the cd,"I'd have to say that i simply disagree with those of you who are dissapointed in this CD. I would have to say they made a tremendous comeback since there previous album ""Untouchables"" which to me wasnt a very impressive CD. I've been listening to Korn for about 3 years now and I would have to say that they've combined there sounds from there first Korn album to a bit of Untouchables and Issues, I am impressed with this CD and has some great guitar riffs. I've found many people have given up on Korn because of there previous album Untouchables which wasnt a big success and thats not right. I believe that those of you that are still korn fans should think about purchasing this CD. It is GREAT!"
2,WEAK COPY,"This album is not original at all. ""LAND OF THE FREE"" is much, much better. In this one, there are many highs and lows, whcih destroys the album. Also, Gamma Ray began to suffer from countless band line-up changes, which in most cases makes a band to fall instead of growing ( see Michael Schenker Group, Whitesnake, etc, etc, etc)... I hope they survive, with quality"
4,Representin from the 612 to the 651!,"Lil Buddy is one of the few artists that has made it outta Minneapolis and now is finally BEGINNING to get the props he deserves. It's hard comin from a place like this (which is DEFINITELY not known for it's hip-hop talent, although there are MANY talented rappers up here).This is a good CD with nice beats and great guest spots from the rest of the Igloo Knob family. Hopefully, this album will open the doors for other worthy artists up here in the Twin Cities of Minnyap & St. Paul (Sandman & Macalot and Upset Tha Locksmith just to name a couple).Recognize! Minneapolis takin over the hip-hop scene in the year 2G baby! Well....maybe not, but hopefully we can at least get some respect!"
5,Awesome Wallet :),I love this wallet. It has many compartments. I have it in red and black and I absolutely love it :) Very satisfied and highly recommended.
4,Awesome & Cheap,"I bought this CD, less than 1/2 what i would have paid elsewhere. The CD, and songs are great. While it took a little longer than expected to arrive, had no problems -- and can't beat the price. If you're Anastacia Fan, great CD."
4,Deep -simply soulful album for Anastacia.,"The first time I could imagine when I heard this record is Anastacia's struggles against her cancer. And that struggles make this album such a masterpiece! Anastacia is right about ""great song mostly made when the writer was depress, sick, or in the bad situation."" This album has solu power that any other album doesn't have. The opening Seasons Change & Left Outside Alone is really rocks and mean to me. All the songs from Time until Welcome to My Truth are really great! But from Pretty Little Dum Dum until the end the soul of the album is down (even Where Do I Belong & Maybe Today also good). After all, I don't guarantee all of Anastacia old fans for this album, because her music color has changed, but for YOU who like a great, deep also easy listening, and soulful, you should & must buy this!!!!!"
4,it is a great compilation,"this is a great production by icp. one bad thing about it: it just runs through segments of their songs. this cd/tape isn't in production anymore, but i'm glad i have it on tape! if you can get your hands on this item, GET IT!!!!"
4,LISTENING TO THE SAMPLES. NOW TO BUY,AFTER LISTENING TO THE SAMPLES I'M NOW READY TO BUY H. BUDD'S CD. THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST.
3,Good in concepts,"This is a great book to understand the java related middleware technoligies conceptually, but it would have been awsome if the author had hard coded all his concepts. Over all the book does not justify its price. The third edition should probably put all the concepts down in implementation."
5,Good introduction to CORBA,"Having lived & breathed COM/DCOM for the past 3 years I have imbibed the litany of contempt put forth by the COM/DCOM pundits for all things JAVA or CORBA related. This book was specifically vilified. I found it to be a very good introduction to various distributed models, CORBA included; although it is more a comparison among them than a book just about CORBA/JAVA. The most balanced comparison between CORBA & DCOM I have ever read."
3,Lots of comparisions,"I found the authors comparing corba against rmi, and other stuff fill more than half of the book. If you want a book on programming corba with java beans or servlets, this is not for you, there are better books out there.Anand"
3,Great first half...but the second half is painfully bad,"I loved this book...until I got into the second half of it.The first part of the story is very well written. It sucks you in & keeps the pages turning...even though I kinda figured out ""who did it"" fairly early.The second half of the book...focusing on the investigation & prosecution...is painfully bad. It's repetitive, plodding, clumsy...and just plain hard to read."
3,The fascination of the story is undermined by author's style,"The story of the arson inspector who turns out to be a firebug is a true man-bites-dog story, one made more compelling by the betrayal of trust and life-and-death stakes. Unfortunately, the story pokes along, punctuated by Wambaugh's efforts to show how clever he is as a writer. Fire Lover does not compare well to The Onion Field, a spell-binding non-fiction work by the same author, but if you want the facts related to this case, this book provides them."
5,A wonderful book for Teenage girls...,"This story is about four siblings who learn to live on their own after their parents die. Angela and Tomas must learn to fend for themselves and their three siblings. Angela and Tomas must teach the smaller children how to do chores,cook, and make them do their homework. Eventually they all learn how to depend on each other and get the most rough times together ,even when Angela and Tomas begin to have their own relationships. All in all i think this book is a great book to read!!"
4,You can be sure...,"Lovely selection whether or not you even had heard of 'Frampton Comes Alive.' This album is consistent throughout and is nice as either background music during friendly dinner parties or full-blasting latenight headphone listening.There's a little something missing in the production and editing that I can't seem to pin down in words - but there is a sincerity and an artist's loss of ego that is rare and welcome.I think it got buried by the crap that's marketed onto kids with their sought after stash of disposable income which media pimps are so fond of; but kids, you'll get a little closer to Mom and Pop if you share this one with them before they die...it'd be the same as telling them 'you loved them.'"
3,Nice but overpriced,"I'll admit as an 360 owner I had some bias against the Ps3, but after playing it I have to say that it's a nice machine. The graphics were tight and the game (Resistance:Fall of Man) played well. My two gripes are the price and the hard drive usage. At $500-600 it's more like buying a PC without the benefit of burning capabilities. And something that you don't hear about much is how much hardrive space is used per game. RFOM took up 1GB on the HDD.If you can afford it I recomend picking one up. And if you live in Tempe AZ you can find them at Gamestop at the Groves on the corner of priest and elliot."
4,Hmmm,"According to the discussion threads, it looks like if you order it now, you may not get it until early January..when you probably wont be able to sell it at all for the skyrocketing price you oh so desire. Plus if you really do put it into perspective, the games do not look as good as you think on ordinary television, as a matter of fact some websites claim that it looks like ps2 graphics compared to HD. So if you have HD go for it baby, if not, you probably want to hold off for a bit. Plus the launch games are not that fun/look good as they will be in the future. The only nicely reviewed title was resistance fall of man."
3,No good,"Not worth the money, Japan has reported issues and bugs with over half the units they shipped within the first week. Sony ramped up production to meet demand but forgot to make a good product.Don't get me wrong, its fun to play but the wii has the style and fun of a new console. PS3 is nothing we haven't seen in a 360 and the xbox platform is worth its weight. If your interested in buying a PS3... Don't. Instead buy an xbox 360, a Wii, and a game or two for the same price. Wait 8 months for the bugs to correct and the price to drop 200 bucks then go ahead and invest.Remember though, Sony hasn't signed any new titles unique to their system. They have the Metal gear and Devil May Cry series but nothing new that is strictly for their platform. X-box is releasing every game PS3 has and more.Save your money! Let the un-informed buy this product!"
5,The Best Trumpet Ensemble Ever,"I am an avid amateur trumpet player and own around 100 trumpet albums. There are not many recordings of some of these works available except on this CD and the performances are, for me, the definitive performances of these magnificent baroque master pieces. This CD is the best trumpet ensemble album I've ever heard and I've been listening to these things for 30 years. Even though the album is a reissue of an earlier vinyl LP the sparkling sounds of the strings and trumpets is undiminished. The performances are all first rate. Not only do the performers play all the pieces in their original keys (the Altenburg in D!)but the baroque ornamentation on the Vivaldi is like nothing I've heard before! It is wonderful. Of interest to the trumpet player will be the fact that the type of trumpet used to play each piece is listed. For instance they do the Vivaldi on Schilke G piccolo trumpets. Get it before it goes out of print.Emmett Anglin(...)"
2,Naggy reading,"I totally agree with the idea that Dr. Larua has on parents raising their children and stay at home moms. However, the book really started to grate on my nerves. I found myself skimming to get through the chapters and onto the next.Book is also a bit hard to follow due to Dr. Lauras ""voice"" then quotes from articles or other books or callers from her radio show.I read the book, knowing that I want to be a stay-at home mom and _I_ want to raise my children (yet to be born I might add) and not have ""a 16 year old raising them"" as Dr. Laura might say. Dr. Laura definitely stresses this in her book yet it becomes too much. the book has negative tones to it."
1,"If there was a lesser score, she'd get it.","I flipped thru this book just out of curiousity, because #1, I think this ridiculous woman is a farce and a affront to all women. I was going to try to keep an open mind about her and see if she has a clue of what she talks about. She doesn't. She also doesn't know how to keep an objective view about anything, her style is blatantly explotative. I can't tell you how much she disgusts me. The book reflects her one tract closed closet she claims is a mind. I would never recommend reading anything this person writes at all. I can't use the words I would like to use to tell you what I really think about this bleached blond joke. She has no business being a talk show host, or a radio host, her credentials are a joke. Just like the person herself. She makes me ashamed to say we have ONE thing in common. We are both chromonsonally female. The book is trite, and way to predictable. Just like her. Kim"
1,"Only Good to Boost Your ""Stay-at-Home"" Ego","I took a leap of faith buying this book... and fell off a cliff. I suspect only ""Stay-at-Home"" parents will like this book. If you are a working parent your child will be in hell, according to this book, and you probably beat your kids too. I never heard Dr. Laura's radio show before buying this book. I now know I never will."
1,putting the horse behind the cart,"The conclusion that american parents' tendency leave too much child rearing to socalled experts is contributing to the very behavioural problems these experts are sought for is undoubtly right.The intolerance of towards anybody differnt the author promotes - be it towards single parents, gays, lesbians or people from a different etnicity, will contribute however to the insecurity of parents which is the reason why they are seeking out these experts in the first place.Claiming that people are morally inferior will not boast their self conficdence as parents nor benifit the larger community itsself.While I liked the original approach of the author I was shocked by the bigottery displayed further on."
3,Insect Lore Pop-Up Port-A-Bug,My grandchild will use this product next summer and we believe he will enjoy it. However when he opened the Christmas gift and tried to zip the zipper...the tab fell off and cannot be reattached. We will need to create some sort of tab so he can pull it open. Very disappointing that it fell off on the first use.Insect Lore Pop-Up Port-A-Bug
5,"Entretenido, excelente","Una excelente colección de temas para bailar, para escuchar, para sentir... Músicos de calidad indiscutible. Quiero más discos de esta serie."
4,What people should be buying. A Classic,Alligator Gun's first offering. Is what I consider to be a very important album of what independent music is today. Unfortunately they broke up before anybody paid any attention to them. Semianl Milwaukee melodic punk outfit with emoish overtones.Members went on to play in bands such as Promise Ring and Hey Mercedes to name a few. A must have For Any rock fan.
5,Still One of the Best,"The phrase ""a household name"" has rarely been more truly applied than it was to the name Bridey Murphy during the late 1950s and early `60s. The impact of Morey Bernstein's book was felt in virtually every city, town, and hamlet in the Western world because it suggested that the theretofore alien concept of reincarnation was a demonstrable fact. In the media frenzy that followed the book's release - it was even made into a movie - numerous falsehoods were circulated as debunkers and überskeptics attempted to undermine the evidence. These days, the idea of reincarnation is not so novel and the brouhaha over Bernstein's book seems almost a bit of quaint Americana; nevertheless, the evidence remains so strong that the case is currently ranked ninth in the Survival Top 40. -- Reviewer is the author of [ASIN:0971044821 The Survival Files: The Most Convincing Evidence Yet Compiled for the Survival of Your Soul]"
2,a one sided story,"The story line was good and all, like most of the books with the secretary loving the boss, but the entire story was one sided. All you read about was what she felt, only once or twice did you know what he felt or what he thought. If the story went back and forth from points of views, I would have given a better rating, but the 2 stars is pushing it for me, and I've come to like most of the books that I read."
1,Counter-response to misled last 'reviewer',"Friend, the issue is not the sincerity of Mr. Pinnock. I believe he is most sincere. The issue is that he is sincerely wrong. Misled. Scripturally Self-deceived. Erroneous. Fallacious. Heterodox. Aberrant in theology. Mormonistic in doctrinal leanings (God somehow 'embodied'??? Actualizing his temporal nature???? Processism???) OOPS.Back to the Bible, Friend. Would that Mr. Pinnock would try again without the Book of Mormon this time."
4,Good book about the entire life of Robert E. Lee,"I enjoyed this book very much, as it gave a good overview of the entire life of Robert E. Lee and not only the war years. It included quotes from letters that he wrote to family members, as well as things other people wrote about him at the time, and that added to the flavor of the book and gave a good sense of what kind of man he was. I especially enjoyed reading the brief biography of his father and how the book included commentary on what was happening elsewhere to give a well-roundedness to the life of Lee. However, I felt the author's commentary on reconstruction went on a bit too long. The author's tone was very ""pro"" Lee and, in that vein, he criticized others, which I don't think was necessary to get the point across. Altogether, I enjoyed this book and it has inspired me to want to seek out more information, not only about Robert E. Lee, but about the Civil War in general, and about other leaders during those times."

2,Nothing special,"This really isn't anything extraordinary. The fact that their single, Right Now, and Politically Correct, are the first songs on the record make you think it's going to be good, but the music fizzles after that. It's good background music for doing homework or falling asleep, but that can be said about other albums that are more worth the money. In short, I found the CD rather boring, though the first two songs are borderline awesome."
2,One song that is sort of good.,"The title of this review says it all. I hadn't gone out on a limb for a band in a while so I decided to try it with SR-71. Boy what a mistake. Other tahn right now this cd only goes down hill. The songs seem to be tossed and if you pay any attention to the lyrics you will probably be dumber for having listened. I don't mean a Blink 182 funny-dumb way either. Just a ""what the hell does that mean"" dumb. Try to avoid unless you really want to."
5,SR71,"Wow... im the first one to review this CD and it hasnt even come out yet... well their single ""Right Now"" is good so im sure this will be too. So buy it... right now... hahaha..."
2,Not at all what I expected,"When I heard the song ""right now"" on the radio, I got the idea that SR71 was a new band similar to Blink 182. I really like ""right now"" so I went to the store and bought the cd. When I listened to the CD, the first two songs were good, and then all of a sudden they became a pop band. I was totally shocked and disappointed. They turned out to be totally opposite of what I thought they would be. I'm not saying that pop music is bad, it's just not what I expected in this cd. I blame the radio stations for giving us the wrong idea about this band. All in all I'm not a pop person, so I didn't really enjoy this album as much as I thought I would have. From now on, I'm going to read reviews before I buy a CD from a band I don't know too much about."
3,"Good Cd, but not everything","I first heard of SR-71 off the radio with their song ""Right Now"" That, i must say is a really awesome song, and one of the other song on the album ""Politically Correct"" follows along the same lines fo really awesome music. How can you dislike a song that starts off ""I don't mean to piss you off"" ? The rest of the cd is okay, and it tends to grow on you the more that you listen. I think it's a good cd, but i'd be better off with the first two songs."
3,Great single; Not such a great band,"I, like many other people here, heard Rght Now on the radio, thought ""Cool, a new Green Day"", completely ignored any warnings that the rest of the CD was not so punkish, and went out and bought it. Well, I still love Right Now,(It probably could have fit right in on Dookie, no problem.) and Politically Correct is good too, but the rest of the CD is a little different. It's okay, and it has a few good moments, ie Last Man on the Moon and Non-Toxic, it just isn't really what I wanted. Also,What a Mess is truly annoying and should have never been included here. All in all, tracks 1-2 are perfect pop punk, 3-11 could have been recorded by any number of other bands and you could never tell the difference. Once they improve a little on their lyrics and stick to the punk pop they do best, SR-71 will be an excellent band; until they do that, however, they're just another fairly expressionless face in the crowd."
1,Now I see inside another episode of living hell,"Oh, jeepers, ANOTHER round of teen pop. Looks like it's time to return to my roots."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still a good album","When I heard ""Right Now"" on the radio, I thought they would be a new punk band. I got out and bought the album and was quite supprised. I came to find that the only punk song on the album is ""Right Now"". The rest of the album is more of a modern mainstream rock sound. They have a good variety of music on it. There is acoustic, punk, and just mellow rock. This band sounds like a blend of Blink 182, Splender, and Matchbox 20. Overall I was impressed with the whole album. So if you buy this expecting punk music, you may be dissapointed."
4,groovin cd that really grabs you,"The debut album is awesome. Goes from heavy to more melodic songs. The two songs that are on the radio, ""right now"" and ""politcally correct"" are good, but don't stand up to songs like ""paul mcartney"", and ""non toxic"". ""Non Toxic"" is easily the best song on this album. I bought this thinking that it would satisfy my need for a good pop rock record and was happily surprised at how good it was. If you like bands like Poison, Goo Goo Dolls, and Tonic, than this cd is for you. IT ISN'T A PUNK RECORD, and I really don't understand why people think it is. Its all rock n roll. And to me, that's all good!"
3,Not for the Psycho types,"Psychos beware, if you like poppy psychobilly this is for you. If you're a Demented Are Go! fan save yourself the pain. Of course if your a Demented Are Go! fan pain sounds like a blast :)."
5,Really neat football card album!,I bought this for the football cards and page protectors for my 9-year old granddaughter who LOVES football!! She was thrilled and loves the football on the front.
4,Good book with one tiny problem!,Got the book in good time worked out great but there was a hole in the binding which isn't a major deal but a bit depressing... :(
2,Very surprised that it is JUST a binder- NO PAGES!!,"Whenever I have bought a book of this kind it ALWAYS included the pages but this one does not have any pages, it is only a binder with a picture of a football on the cover. What a total rip-off for ten bucks!! I was very surprised that not one person who reviewed this item included this information and that the seller did not include this info either. All the description says is, ""You can add as many pages as you want"" - yea add them, or fill the book with them is a better description!"
3,Research & Documentation in the Electronic Age review,"I found this product to be in very good condition, being that it was used. I have no problems with it, and I am looking forward to using it this Fall."
2,"Nice effort in many ways, but...","...leaves the reader with a desire for less editorializing and more objectivity. Additionally, the proofreading\editing needed tightening; there were several instances in the book where spelling lacked and even one point where one subject was referred to by the wrong name; misleading and confusing if the reader isn't paying attention. These errors alone indicate a haphazard attitude with the construction of the book. Aside from these problems, the book is entertaining but the reader quickly learns that the stories contained within are more a compilation of the authors opinion on the cases rather than straight facts. Entertaining, but not a totally factual reference."
5,MURDER ON THE KING RANCH,The Book is a very cool one to read it is a true story and I hope that people will read it more and it is histroy and it is my family member that was disappered in the King Ranch he was my Unlce John Blanton he was married to my Aunt Ruth Walker Blanton
1,Mislead,"I ordered this item to serve as a simmer plate on a standard electric stove. After receiving the item I learned that there is a 1/2"" rim on the underside of the Diffuser/Reducer (which is not shown in any illustration on the website) that prevents the plate from making direct contact with the electric burner eye, rendering the Diffuser/Reducer useless. It became apparent to me that this Diffuser/Reducer is made for a gas range which was not indicted anywhere in the information on the website. I wasted shipping cost ($20+) to receive and then send this item back for refund on something that I could not have used. No attempt was made to compensate me for any of my cost. Therefore I would not do business with Chef Tools again and may hesitate using links via Amazon as well. Buyer beware."
1,Not worth it,"I had purchases two 7 inch diffusers and they work perfectly. I bougth this due to it's size and after using it once, I will not use it again. The hole in the middle does create a ""hot"" spot on the botton of the pan placed on top of it and due to that will burn sauces. Had this been solid, like the 7 inch diffusers, I am sure it would have worked just a well."
5,Wonderfully warm and moving.,The Sequoia String Quartet's performance of the the Ravel Quartet is wonderfully warm and moving. You'll want to pick up a copy for your collection!
3,Great Novelist but..,"White boy shuffle is my favourite books of all time. I own three different editions of it. I spent a year having a crush on a boy just because he read and loved the book too, in fact this guy had a plan to write a letter to Paul Beatty and keep it in his back pocket, just in case he met da man.But Paul's Poetry speaks very little to me. Partly because there are far too many basketball references which I don't understand, not growing up in the States, and when i read it to myself, I can't pick up the meter and the rythm of the words.I think it is good, but if you know nothing about basketball, and don't really like rap, you, like me, will probably not get what the author intended us to hear. If only there was a cassette version."
3,Satisfactory.,"this sure is not the album that i reach for if i want to listen to OLP. there's about 40 seconds of melody in the entire album. all of this was influenced by the whole grunge revolution in the early 90's. definetly not all that good. this one is not carried in my CD case that i take with me driving and stuff, so if you're listening to anything on naveed minus the birdman, hope, and the track naveed, count me out. it's ok, but not something i really want to listen to unless i'm in a bad mood. not to say that the guitar work isnt good or something because it really is good. i'm just not that big of a fan of the bass, drums, vocals setup that really drives the album and if i dont like it, i'm not gonna listen to it. so dont come out looking for another great, melodic album, because this is the absolute opposite."
3,ok,Took a while to get in to the show must of the showi saw later in the season that why i bought these did not no some cast was not in this one but a good show
5,LMAO,"It took a while for the DVD to arrive, but that was due to a mix up at the U.S. Post Office.It was a gift for my dad that was to be placed in an Easter Basket with goodies. Because it came after Easter, I ended up giving it to him as a get well gift because he became ill a week after Easter. We popped the DVD into the player and he was laughing out loud. They say laughter is the best medicine, and he was back to his happy 'ol self in no time. I plan on buying him all the seasons to enjoy. Thank you for the wonderful humor that you bring into the lives of so many."
4,Tender Rebel,"This may not be the best Mallory novel Ms. Lindsey has written but it's darned close. Tony is every woman's dream - Tall, dark, and handsome. And who can resist a ""bad boy"". Apparently not Rosalyn, the beautiful heiress looking for a husband. She gets more than she bargained for in Tony, though. Also great are the reappearence of Nicholas and Regina Eden, Tony's niece and black sheep nephew-in-law from the first Mallory novel. You can guess who is match making. This is an all around great romance second only to Gentle Rogue, the story of Anthony's brother James."
5,A Hero's Hero,"This book has the best hero that Johanna Lindsey has ever written about: Anthony Malory. I love it when James and him get together, but Anthony alone makes my blood boil. I think Anthony's gentle but bold seduction of Roslynn is the best part of the book. And of course, who can forget the lesson he teaches her in ""the chair?"" It's also funny the way Ros keeps wondering why Tony married her: was it for her money or simply because he wanted her? The answer to that question certainly keeps Ros and the reader on the edge of their senses. All in all, Ms. Lindsey has proven once again why she is my favorite romance writer."
5,Heart Stopping Romantic & Humorous!,"This is my favorite book of all time. I can never get enough of it! There was never a boring part in the book. I just could not put it down. I loved the way Anthony trying to make Rosylnn's other suitors look real bad to convince her in not to marrying them because he wanted her to himself. I like the way Anthony and Rosylnn were captivated by each other when they saw each other the very first time. Rosylnn's fiery temper with her Scottish brogue really made a match for handsome rake, Anthony Malory. Johanna Lindsey has done it again. I loved it!"
5,Tender Rebel is perhaps the best book in the Malory series.,"Tony is everything a hero should be: heartwrenchingly handsome, hard-to-get, and in love with the heroine. The way he rescues Roslynn touched me every time I read this book. And even though I know the ending, I always find myself encouraging her to rethink her position. The story is sweet and heartfelt, the ending makes me laugh and cry. Johanna Lindsey has set a standard for herself on this one. Great read."
3,"Acceptable performance, but lacks in musicality","The major work on this album is clearly the Piano Sonata in Bm. I own four recordings of this piece, and this is the worst of the bunch. Right off the bat, there is a lack of ferocity in the Lento assai beginning and an as he plays through the 17 or so tempo changes, I can't help feel that I'm being shortchanged by the performance. Maybe this is because I am constantly comparing the performance to the benchmark performance by Martha Argerich (which is available on multiple recordings Martha Argerich Collection DG, Debut Recital DG, Greatest Pianists of the 20th Century II Philips).If you want the Liszt Piano Sonata, buy the Argerich version. Browning's performance is forgettable. Argerich's performance is spectacular."
2,Janet didn't write this,"Here's how I think this book was written: Evanovich and Hughes sat down and mapped out some characters. Hughes wrote the book, then Evanovich read it and added a few (and only a few) bits of her trademarked humor. Like when Jamie says ""Probably I should have a cigarette,"" now THAT'S Evanovich's distinctive type of dialogue.Would've been much better if Swamp Dog had turned out to be on their side. Why make him a bad guy?! Added nothing. Had he been in on it before Max and Jamie went down to see him? And who *did* hire Vito? And why did they hire a lame-... who'd never killed before? That was never made explicit.We're supposed to think Deedee is a nice, lovable person, but they only *tell* us that, never *show* us that. She acts like nothing but a spoiled rich woman.I don't give it one star because I didn't *hate* it, just thought, hmmm, blah. I think the Swift/Holt partnership has potential.But as others have said, make up your mind: is Max a cousin or a brother-in-law?!!"
4,Funny and an enjoyable read,"I liked this book and the characters. I read Full House and enjoyed that also. I would of liked to not have them jump 20 years ahead, but it was a great easy read. I also like the Stephanie Plum series and just found these different. They are more like Charlotte Hughes than Janet Evanovich. They are a little less intense than Evanovich. I would highly recommend this for a sit by the pool and laugh kind of book."
2,"no Stephanie, but still O.K.","I've never thought of myself as lowbrow before, but all the scathing reviews of Full Tilt and Full Speed are making me rethink that.Let's get this out of the way right up front: No, this isn't nearly as good as a Stephanie Plum novel. The tale of weekly newspaper publisher Jamie Swift and dashing tech billionaire Max Holt is much more lightweight and campy, even. Max is as much a caricature as James Bond; the gun-toting, Bible-thumping Vera is a harpy; no woman is as superficial as Deedee (at least I hope not!) and the flaming queen Beanie is an insult to gay men everywhere. Only Jamie is somewhat realistic. But Full Tilt was still fun, especially Muffin the world's most amazing computer. I've definitely read worse.If you go into it expecting it to be no better than your average sitcom, you won't be disappointed. I have to admit that, as soon as I finished Full Tilt, I ordered Full Speed from the library. Maybe I should consider it a guilty pleasure."
5,Knight Rider Chapter 2525,"First of all this book is a Michael Knight's chapter with his KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) car, do you remember that TV program? The car that speaks, and drives herself?Well with that in mind and that every JE's books had nothing to think about, nothing to learn about, but something to have a good time reading them you can read this book, this book will not give you anything but a pleasant time reading it, of course if you liked The Knight Rider Show, if you didn't like it just skip this one."
2,"Not her best, but has some good points","Full House had potential, and Max Holt was interesting in that, so I was looking forward to seeing him in Full Tilt. But he was totally different -- what happened to his change the world revolutionary zeal? I thought Muffin (the talking computer) was the best part of the book -- I did hear the audiobook version, which I think added a lot, because you hear her talking in her Marilyn Monroe voice. The wrestlers were just kind of there, not really doing anything funny as in the first book. I thought Beanie was okay, and I liked the relationship between him and Dee-dee, but I was disappointed in Dee-dee, who was so funny in the first book. Anyway, this is not up to Janet Evanovich's usual standards, sadly enough. It makes you appreciate her normal flair."
1,BORING!,"I am sorry to say: the worst of Evanovich. Stephanie Plum rules but this book has a lame plot, no memorable characters, no fun, no sex, one word BORING!!!!!!"
1,Bummer!!,This was a nightmare. The bugs looked like little cockroaches not like lady bugs at all. We called to get new bug because most of them died. Most of them died.the second time too. So disappointing. :(
4,A Lovely Ladybug Learning Experience,"I ordered this for my four year old. She loves it! She catches and releases ladybugs, and the ease with which the top comes off makes it a snap for her to use on her own. She waters and feeds her ladybugs, and enjoys watching them through the magnified top window. It is well worth the money we spent."
1,They won't ship the lady bugs to Michigan!,"We were so excited to try lady bugs after having so much fun with the butterflies. We waited and waited for our habitat to come. When if finally did, I went online to use the voucher for the live lady bugs. When I tried to check out, I got an error message letting me know that shipping lady bugs in to Michigan was prohibited by law. I was so mad! There should be a list of states listed with the description that they can't ship to. I was so irritated because I feel they should have stopped me from buying the habitat in the first place! It just would have been nice to know and had been given a choice from the beginning. Thankfully, I did buy from Amazon and was able to easily send it back with out hassle."
1,Escape artists,"The clear plastic dome was not tightly fitted to the base, which we discovered when we repeatedly found ladybug larvae crawling outside of it. We put them back in and re-adjusted the dome to be sure it was on as securely as possible. But still they managed to get out at the bottom between the base and the dome. I had Ladybug Land on my kitchen counter, and one day discovered a larva in my cereal box as well as one under the kitchen sink. I moved it to a more isolated location, but still all but two escaped, one of which died. The remaining ladybug larva also died, but it had help. Someone filled the water too full and it drowned. None of them made it to the ladybug stage. Quite a disappointment."
1,Very disappointing!,"We were so excited to try this out with our little boy, but it was not what we expected. The only exciting day of insect watching came the day that the shipment arrived from Insect Lore - the ladybug larvae moved around a lot for about a day, then hid for almost 5 days while they turned into ladybugs. Once they were ladybugs, they just sat around and didn't do anything (they only seemed to move when we weren't looking at them). Then they died. Wow, what a letdown. Next time, we'll go with an old-fashioned ant farm!"
2,False Advertising,DO NOT buy this book if you need the MyDevelopmentLab. It does not come with the required material to use the lab.
5,The most sensual book I've read in years,"It's been years since I've read anything with a combination of fantastic recipes, good humour and fun. I force myself to read a chapter per day only, so this marvel lasts longer. Congratulations to Ms. Allende."
1,Disappointing,"After reading all Isabel Allende's books at least twice, I found it hard to believe she could have written Aphrodite, a book with absolutely no substance. At this point ih her career, Allende did not need to sell herself as the ""sexy Latina"" we see on her book. After the dense and sincere ""Paula"", ""Aphrodite"" is nothing more than a bad joke. One of the finest Latin American writers seems to have sold out to the Hollywood stereotype. What a pity! My star goes to the illustrations, much better than the writing itself."
2,A Paul Madriani fan,"I was disappointed by The Arraignment. In all the previous stories in the Paul Madriani series, plots are advanced and suspense is built through nicely crafted testimony and cross-examination in the courtroom. No such courtroom scenes are to be found in The Arraignment. Instead, author Steve Martini tells a more visual story, with action sequences that he seems to have written with visions of a movie deal dancing through his head - knife fights, gun battles, and even a James Bondish scene in which two men on an ultralight plane spray a hotel pool deck with bullets while Madriani runs and dives and bloodies himself eluding the gunfire (rather than simply taking refuge inside the hotel). The book ends with a lengthy epilogue that is needed to explain the convoluted actions and motivations that lie behind this tortured tale. If there's another book in this series, Martini would do well to return Madriani to the place he performs best, in the courtroom."
3,Not Martini's Best But Not Altogether Bad,"I find that Steve Martini usually writes easy to follow plots with likable but uncomplicated characters. He over-steps a bit in this novel, The Arraignment. The book is full of characters which we never get to know completely, unfinished story lines, and a convoluted plot that needs to be explained in the final chapter. I lumbered through it only because I thought it had to get better. By the end, still confused, I had to read the epilogue if only to find out how all the stories and characters fit together. The antagonist is obvious from the beginning but even at the end his motives aren't exactly clear."
3,A different novel from his usual,"Martini has strayed from his well-established and successful themes that had catapulted him to his position as a legal thrilled author. In this novel, he has moved to the action thriller. Gone is the court room drama that I had so much enjoyed in many of his prior efforts. It is a stretch to take Paul Madriani from his role as a legal eagle, single parent and turn him into a daredevil crime fighter operating outside the police driven investigation. I suppose that if you are not familiar with Martini's earlier works, this would satisfy, however those who are long term fans will be disappointed."
2,Madriani in Mexico - Not His best,"The title implies another Paul Madriani courtroom novel. The title is grossly misleading. In fact after reading the book one wonders why it was named as it was because it has so little to do with the plot or action in the book. Madriani becomes some kind of private detective in this book after a friend of his dies in a hail of bullets while talking to a client outside the courthouse before the client is to be arraigned. That's as close as this book ever gets to a courtroom. The rest of it entails Madriani trying to find out what his friend was involved with and why he was killed, which nearly gets Madriani killed. The answer is not particularly interesting and how it is revealed is less so. There really is little to recommend this book....and I don't."
3,Steve Martini not at his best,"I have enjoyed all of Steve Martini's novels. I would rate this one as very average.The first quarter of the book is compelling. However, it quickly gets bogged down in insurance payments, that neither wife is actually entitled to.This is light reading at best. If you put down this novel you may not pick it up again for a long time."
2,Half Action Half Lawyer - Half Baked,In his other books when he fully concentrates on law or on thriller (e.g. critical mass) he is able to put his full heart behind his writing. This book really meanders. It starts off as a legal stories wanders as a narrative in the middle and ends up as a half baked thriller story. There are two stories intertwined but neither is explained easily. Suddenly our dear lawyer has become an action hero. How he survives multiple spots where he would get killed beats me. When you try to do a number of things you often end of doing none of them well.
2,It Happens in the Epilogue,"Arraignment was my first Steve Martini book, and I followed the convoluted plot with interest. Much of the plot was implausible but still interesting and worth the time. However, when the denouement occurred in the epilogue, I was stunned. Mr. Martini ends the last chapter of his book with loose ends everywhere. This forces him to give the reader information in the epilogue that he has omitted in the plot. I will give Mr. Martini's work one more chance, but I would not recommend Arraingment."
2,Not best ever bug jar,The jar has a nice see through area - but the lid is difficult for little hands to get on and off - and the handle has to be turned down in order to do it. (Handle popped off the first time we did it - you would have to keep putting it back on.) I have the other one with a little door on the end that is easy to slide open. Other downside - the jar is slippery so bugs don't crawl around in it like they do on the screen bug house. No - not the best ever bug jar. And with three grandsons - I should know.
3,Un tèrmino medio,"Steve Howe es el único miembro de Yes que ha mantenido una cierta coherencia en su carrera en solitario. Aún con altibajos, su sonido, no es que se parezca a Yes, pero mantiene unos niveles de calidad bastante aceptables. Es más en la epoca que siguió a 1983, los discos de Steve Howe son, casi siempre, mejores que los del grupo. Este disco, sin embargo, es, probablemente, el peor de su carrera. En cierta forma es similar a Beginnings, aunque con el lastre de que los temas son peores. La voz de Howe a mi, particularmente, me recuerda mucho a la de Neil Young, aunque con menos garra y, desde luego no es su fuerte, aunque a mi no me desagrada cuando adopta un tono más íntimo como ocurre en los dos discos de Homebrew. Los instrumentales brillan, en este disco, con luz propia, mientras que los temas cantados, además de las mencionadas debilidades vocales de Mr. Howe, son bastante planos. En definitiva, sobra la mitad del disco."
3,"Some new, Some old","While initiallly rehashing Covey's four quadrants theory, the book lays the groundwork for setting priorities. People who do not have time to take the Focus On Priorites course will gain insight into Covey's methodology of setting goals and priorities. While not as inspiring as other works, it still was a good help (but not great)..."
3,not thier best but not terrible,"people hated this albulm so much when it was released in 1992 because it dosent have the classic toto sound. although the albulm does have a heavier sound than toto fans are used to it is not all that bad it isdefinitely not in the same class as toto, hydra, or toto iv those were great albulms but it didnt deserve the bashing it initialy recieved."
1,deffinately not the toto sound of the eighties,"out of 12 songs, I thought 1 was good,1 alright and the rest were crap (although some had good rythem and beat but not much else) I will say this, I only listened to the album once, and sometimes it takes a few times for an album to grow on you, but I don't see that happening with many of those songs. Ill stick with the Toto of the early 80's where Toto IV ROCKS."
2,"Good writing, uncomfortable content","While I appreciated Thomas's writing ability and the interesting organization of this book, I felt very uncomfortable with the sexual content. I'm not a prude, but I squirmed reading ""Kennedy's"" puerile thoughts about the private parts of every woman he saw. And the nuns! Don't even ask. Lyndon Johnson was particularly sleazy.It seemed like Thomas read a lot of books on the Kennedy White House and the assassination, and then just cobbled together the aspects he found interesting.Fortunately, this book was short and fast reading. I wasn't bored, but I didn't like it."
4,Dope ish!!!,"Now people consider this ol' school. I remember when this joint came out ""Ish is real"" and ""Masta I.C."" were in the deck in heavy rotation. This was when nobody knew Irv Gotti, Ja Rule, DMX or Jay-Z and they were all a part of this LP. Unfortunately, Mic Geronimo never got the credit that his counterparts did, but I honestly think his 1st LP was better than the other artist's cataloge. (Except Jay-Z)This LP will make you want to get a pair of Tims and represent. There's only a couple of tracks that make the LP a little bumpy, Mic's attempt at making a radio/R&B; track. But all n' all a dope LP!!!But, if you did dig those R&B; joints, cop his 2nd LP and if you thought those tracks were wack, avoid his 2nd LP like the plague."

4,timeless!,"Although not L'Engle's best (she admits this in a foreward written years later), this book is still excellent. I read it for the first time when I was a freshman in college, and, while I think I might have enjoyed it more if I were a little younger, I still identified with the protagonist and enjoyed the story immensely. It's rather silly, but it is still L'Engle."
5,AWESOME FINISH!,I only have two words to say about Victoria Taylor Murray's famous Lambert series...AWESOME...AWESOME! What's next Victoria? I can hardly wait to find out!
5,Not just another romantic suspense series!,"Oh, no, no, no, The Lambert Series, by Victoria Taylor Murray, is not just another soap opera. It is better than that! I was impressed by this new writer's fun adult fantasy. I was a little blue when it ended. The good news is, however, I heard through the grapevine that a 'sequel' series is in the mix as we speak. I'm absolutely thrilled about that!"
4,Huge Lambert Fan!,"I understand Ms. Murray has a ""Return to Lambert"" in the mix. That is terrific news! I can hardly wait! It will be a thrilling few books (you can take that to the bank!)If you are a mystery lover or a romance lover (either or) you will fall in love with this new writer!)Buy the books and judge for yourself!"
1,Don't bother!,"This clock only stays wound for about 18 hours, which is counterproductive for a clock."
4,adorable shoes!,"The flowers are cute and big and draw a lot of attention. I usually wear 6.5, and I got the 38, and they fit fine in the front, so I believe the front straps are narrow. The straps also feel flimsy, but they have held up so far."
5,How Sweet It Is...Without the Sugar,"This cookbook is absolutely wonderful. The recipes are easy to follow and come out perfect. They taste scrumptious and are good for you too! I'm not a diabetic, but I will continue to use this cookbook for all my desserts. Jean has a winner with this book. I give it two thumbs up and a 5 star rating!"
2,Sizing runs very small,"No sizing information was provided in the product description, so I ordered the large (largest size available) for my 55 pound boxer. There is no way that this shirt will fit him. Not even close. This shirt is clearly made for a ""large"" small dog.The shirt seems of decent quality, but I'll never use it."
2,Where's the Emotion,"I won't spend a lot of time on this review, because the cd isn't worth it. The songs are fairly well written, but Lara's delivery lacks the emotion of her self titled English language debut. After the incredible power of that debut, this is just disappointing. It sounds as if she's just going through the motions."
2,I lost interest in the book,"It was not what I expected. I lost interest in reading it, and I abandoned it. I will not be buying any more from that author."
1,poorly packed,This product arrived in a broken container with the contents totally spilled all over the box. I immediately called Amazon and the rep had me order from a different merchant. I love the product. I use it for my nails. They are not stronger but they have lost the ridges that one gets with age. They look way better!!!!
3,A contrary review,"To be fair, I am not the target audience for the book. I am a former quantum mechanician who left the field a few decades ago. I decided that it was time to study QM once again. I picked up this book based on its price and excellent reviews here.I did not find anything wrong with the text other than the small print. But there was no sizzle to the explanations or the mathematics. I started to become bored in the harmonic oscillator chapter. There was no particular direction to his development. I finally read an old copy of Dirac on my bookshelf. (His section on the HO is elegant and to the point.)So if you are an older coot like me, look for another book."
1,catastrophe!!!,"[...] this book has nothing to do with QM , it explain so poorly the materiel that some times it's struck me how easily this writer can take simple thing like infinite wall potential and make it complicated!Amazing!There are no examples in this book ! Yes you read right NO EXAMPLES! There are some excises that you can do in your spare time..this look like some lecture note from a prof, that didn't have much time to make it to a real book, don't even hesitate to ask yourself which one is better this or Cohen tanudji...The mathematical introduction that every one is getting excited here is nothing less then total blurr,The good thing in this book is that all the subjects in QM appear there, that's true, but for sure you can not learn any of them ,,..[...]pitty there is only one star grade as the lowest grade one can give, otherwise I would give this book something that look like planck contstant.."
5,Bravo Rene !,"A friend gave me a collection of Rene Barjavel's stories for my birthday, and ""La Nuit des Temps"" is one of the many incredible stories in that collection that really took my breath away. I was amazed that he is not well known in the US. One of the most enduring qualities of his works is not that he focuses on the ""sci-fi"" aspect; the heart of his stories lie in the human condition. I hope all his novels will be translated and that collections of his work will be published and made available in the US. During his lifetime, Barjavel believed that the novel in its classic form is dead and that the future of novels lie in Science Fiction. If we have more writers as insightful and masterful at storytelling as Barjavel, I'd say he would have been right."
4,between the lions.,My daughter loves these videos and the price was great. I think it was a great buy. thank you very much.
2,Too difficult to do for me,"Withing the first minute, I quit doing this video. It is too difficult to learn the moves. He switches to one move to the next too quickly. Someone as big as me cannot keep up the pace of this video and you need a lot of room. I don't have that.Got my hopes up too much that I could finally find a video that I can do. Was very disappointed."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS PARTY OFF POUNDS,"THE EXERCISES WERE EXTREMELY SIMILAR TO PARTY OFF THE POUNDS, BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE MUSIC CHOICES AS WELL OR THE WAY IT SOUNDS. PARTY OFF THE POUNDS IS WAY COOLER!"
5,Boogie Down The Pounds,"This is a fun, fast paced workout, Richard is as fun as always and the group enjoys the music and have alot of fun too. The music is great. I love this video it is the perfect length to do before I go to work. You will sweat and burn calories and reduce your stress."
2,Boggie down the pounds,"I once had the original Richard Simmons, Dancing to the oldies and I loved it. This tape was not up to par. The music sounded more like backround music. I was not satisfied because I expected better and will not use this video."
4,Nice video if you like to dance!,"It's a fun video and a good beginning work out, particularly if you don't want to go to the gym and you like to dance. I only wish someone would come up with something more current."
5,Lovely glimpse of the past,"Poole's book tells the story of aging patriarch Roger Gale and the lives of his three daughters - Laura, with her reckless abandon and zest for life; Deborah, with her fierce devotion to the tenement schoolchildren she assists; and Edith, the mother of five whose entire world revolves around her children. Roger sees their lives change - some for the better, some worse - and how it affects his own life.This is a wonderful story which reminds me at times of E.L. Doctorow's Ragtime, in that it encompasses the scope of life in early twentieth century New York, and the lives of the people who inhabit it. The descriptions are vivid but never too cumbersome; the characters are all very real, and the plot flies by. By the end, I came to care about what happens to these people, and found I was sorry when it was over."
5,"""Reality Check"" the reality of life.",This book is as informative as Weiner's other books. It is well written with a hint of humor so the lay person can understand what they are reading. The mind is such a complicated mass that it takes a great deal of guts to try and explain its workings. Obviously Weiner has done a great deal of research in compiling such an informative book. I would just like to say to the two negative reviews posted that it is easy to criticize someone else for trying to educate others on the workings of the mind ... especially if you don't seem to understand it yourself. I would suggest you read the author's other books...Power Freaks and Battling the Inner Dummy.
1,Will not secure RF in Sequoia with latch,"Not a bad seat, but we are going to return it because in the rear facing installation it will not secure safely with the latches in our 2005 Toyota Sequoia. The geometry of the latch hook location, the seat surface, and the belt path on the car seat combine to make a situation where the car seat is barely restrained from pivoting in a vertical direction. Side-side the car seat can be pretty secure, but the whole seat can pivot upward quite easily, and we do not want to risk harm to our little one."
2,Flimsy arm rests,We returned it for a Graco Ultra CarGo.The arm rests on Coscos are a joke. I guarantee they will break off with little effort.
3,Looks aren't everything!,"This seat has some nice features, like being able to adjust the straps without removing them and it is padded nicely, but there are several flaws. First of all, the sides aren't deep enough, so whenever my daughter fell asleep, her head would fall forward. The straps are flimsy and twist constantly, what a pain! Once she was about 2yrs old, I bought her the Graco Cherished Cargo. She was much more comfy in it on trips when she fell asleep. The Alpha Omega does work fine for short trips, though. My advice would be to find a seat that has deep sides, especially if you have a little one who likes to sleep in the car."
3,Rear-view experience,"We purchased this seat because of it's flexibility to face forward or rear and could grow with our son. The problem we are having is that when we have the seat facing rear it is too vertical and if my son falls asleep his head has no support and ends up hunched over.I have not tried the seat facing forward, but I'm hoping for a better experience."
1,Impossible To Clean,"My parents got this car seat as a present before my son was born. He is now 16 months. My son gets car sick easily and we needed to clean the upholstery of this car seat. It was impossible! You cannot remove the covering without completely disassembling the seat. I had to remove the straps (which we constantly tangled anyway), unscrew the seat belt guides on the side and I still couldn't get the cover off to wash it. The seat has never been very user-friendly and my son's head was always flopping forward when he was younger. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. My husband and I have the Evenflo Triumph in our own car and we LOVE it! I would never buy the Omega Elite. I gave it one star because I believe that when it is installed that it is probably a safe seat."
2,Hated it!,"After trying for an hour to install this seat, I FINALLY got it in. Then, it was so big (I have a Jeep Liberty)that when installed rear-facing, I couldn't see over it. I put my daughter in it twice, and each time she screamed. Needless to say, I returned it the next day."
2,This can't be the best...,"After researching options on the infant to toddler car seats, I decided this had to be one of the best. Practical because it would last until toddler age, safe with the rear facing 5 point harness, comfortable because it looked and felt soft...Not the case at all. We've used it only 4 times and each time it has been 160 something dollars of sheer aggrevation. You're praying you can get the latch fastened fast enough not to upset the baby or hurt the baby in the process, the straps are next to impossible to adjust, the seat takes up the ENTIRE back seat of my 4-door Accord, and you definitely need a neck cushion for the baby in this seat. My husband brought home a Graco infant carrier model to use for now and pulled the Elite out until the baby is older. If you purchase this seat, don't expect to be completely happy."
2,Not very good for rear facing...,"To have this installed correctly per the manufacturer, having the lines level to the ground, you need to have the front seat basically kissing the dash board. Will be returning it and purchasing something else."
2,Impossible to Install,"We bought this car seat for our 8 month old son who outgrew his infant seat. After spending 3 hours trying to install this seat properly (rear facing), we made the decision to return the seat and buy the Britax Marathon, which took about 15 minutes to install and does not move an inch! The Britax also takes up much less space in the back and allows the driver seat to go back further when the car seat is in the fully reclined position. We ended up using this seat for about a week and my son appeared to be comfortable in it, however my husband and I were still not comfortable with the amount the seat moved. If you want to spare a few bloody knuckles don't invest in this seat!"
4,Great Car Seat,I purchased this seat almost 2 years ago for my then 6 month old son. When I purchased it is was missing the LATCH system. I called the co. and they overnighted them to me. The seat takes up a lot of room (especially when rear facing). I have a Infiniti I-30 and am not able to put it in the center it had to be placed on the side.The only problem that I have had is it is difficult to take apart to clean the seat. With a 2 1/2 year old (potty training) it is a pain! But I think I would have the same issue with any car seat. My son loves it. It is comfortable and living in south Louisiana it is not too hot like the thicker seats! I would recommend it and will probably purchase another just like it when I have a second child.
1,Too big for most sedans (rear facing),"We had to return this seat because in order to properly install it rear-facing (fully reclined and leveled) in the back seat of our Mazda 626 (a very 'average' size sedan), the front seats had to be pushed almost entirely forward and could not be reclined. This made driving impossible for one of us, and very uncomfortable for the other.(...).Only consider this seat if a) you own an SUV/minivan with a lot of space between the front seats and the back seat, or b) if you only need it to be a forward facing seat.Nice idea, but it wasn't practical for us."
2,Not worth the $,"I have this car seat in my car, and I am planning on buying another. My son is six months old so it is rear facing. It is impossible to effectively tighten the shoulder straps because the button is firmly against the back seat. Also I just don't feel like the seat fits quite right in my back seat. It seems to be too upright even in the fully reclined position. Fainally the keyed clip is such a pain to use. It takes several attempts to get it lined up correctly and closed. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing."
2,Hard to Use,"We bought this when our 8 months old grew too long for her infant seat. Although it comes with a video (which doesn't help in the car) the user's manuel is very vague so you kind of have to figure it out on your own. It doesn't recline enough for an infant (our daughter's now 1 year and I still wish I could get it to recline more), and if it's rear-facing the only way to adjust it is to unlatch it. Also, adjusting the straps is near impossible unless it's unlatched due to the positioning of the strap release. Oh, and forget about washing the seat cover or straps, they are hard to take off.I'm actually getting rid of this after only 4 months and am getting one that's easier to use."
3,Awakening the higher self: Guided meditation to the Angelic Realm,"I liked this meditation CD. It is a bit more religious, than some others.I found myself even ''teary'' at times, while listening to it, as its very deep. I would recommend it, if you don't mind the religion part in it."
5,attracts butterflies!,"the product works perfectly. I loved it,and so did my 9 year old!it totlly works, and is soooooo fun!the butterflys were everywhere,and my 9 year old had lots of fun!"
2,Certainly not his best work,"I have to admit that this particular novel didn't really reach me. The story is told from the point of view of a 17 year old - but that doesn't excuse the fact that the novel struck me as being a poor attempt to emulate one of Heinlein's juvenile novels. For the first two thirds of the novel plot was somewhat predictable. Past that point, the plot went haywire - things happening for no reason, simply to allow the author to finish off a story he didn't seem to have a decent conclusion for. I found the work disappointing, and could not recommend it to anyone."
3,What are they doing???,"I have been registered at Babies R Us since August but waiting for the travel system to match. I was told it was going to be available in October now they are saying end of November or December. Baby is due in January! Since reading other reviews it sounds like the stroller is not going to match the carseat! WHAT??? I WANT THIS SEAT but not if it doesn't match. Why not just go the step down and get the all cloth travel system. I just checked on Wednesday and they still didn't have the system in, just all cloth tandem. If you are willing to pay for it then why not get what you want!Still waiting...."
5,comment about the ACTUAL seat and not about the stroller,"Good grief, I'm hoping that someone may want to hear an actual review about the carseat itself and not read all the gripes about when and where the matching travel system comes out. I have had this carseat for a couple months now and really love it. My son fits in it comfortably and snuggly and is very safe. The five point harness is wonderful addition. It was a little tricky installing it in the van, but once we took a second to read the instructions we got it in. I wasn't too familiar with the L.A.T.C.H system. I love the looks of it also. I have had a few people comment on how nice of a car seat it is. And it goes from the van to the grocery cart in seconds. I wouldn't base your decision on the comments about the travel system, there are ways of working around that. This is a very nice carseat for the price."
1,Fire dept couldn't even install it!!,"We spent way too much money on the Eddie Bauer infant seat. I thought with a name like EB we would be very satisfied. Instead it was a nightmare. We own a newer Dodge Intrepid and no matter how tight we got the base in it would still slide around. We even brought it to the local Fire Dept that specializes in installing carseats and said this carseat is not safe in our car because it would slide. They even tried to use foam noodles and towels to help support it and that didn't even work. My advice to anyone looking for a carseat is no matter how bad you feel like a nag at the store, ask if you can take the model out to your car and see if it will fit before spending money on something that isn't safe."
4,Travel System is Different!,"If you are like me, you have been waiting for the single travel system in this great pattern to be available. It's in the stores now, and I RAN to Babies R Us and was told the system was exactly like the car seat...I got it home and the system DOES NOT have the faux suede fabric like the car seat in the same pattern that is sold seperately. All that wonderful butter-soft tan suede is replaced by tan canvas. Sure, it will wear better, but if you had your heart set on everything matching the carseat (as I was), prepare yourself!"
2,It gets us by,"We placed this car seat on our registry because we thought that the Eddie Bauer brand would be of good quality, but the straps always slip after about a week of use. The visor doesn't stay up either-it's very flimsy! We did drive accross the country with our daughter at 3 months, and she was comfortable for the entire ride. Overall our daughter likes her car seat, but I question it's safety."
3,It's heavy and the straps twist,"This car seat is very appealing to the eye, but it's pretty heavy and the straps seem to twist rather easily which is a big pain in the neck when you are trying to strap in the baby cause it will not work right until you get the straps fixed. Baby seems to like it though ... must be very comfy!"
3,Ok at first....,I bought the Video Now Jr. for my 3.5 year old. One little fall and now the screen doesnt work. Very disappointed as I paid a decent amount of money for this and it broke not even within a month!
1,Meditations Too Short and Too Rushed,"A lot of people are writing reviews on the book and the artwork, they are correct I give that a 5/5. However this review is on the audio CD meditations not the book. I would give it a 1/5. The reason is she seems like she is just reading the meditations too fast. Meditations need to be read slowly and you need to give people time to visual the meditation and get their body in a meditated state.Therefore the feeling of it being too short as others have wrote in the reviews. I feel like I have wasted my money on this CD. I will go back to reading the meditations from the book myself and recording it and playing it back. You can really stretch the meditation out and even add in some creativity yourself."
3,Some Good Information,"Basically common sense. The information here might be helpful to some people, but I have read better books about relationships."
2,Disappointing!,"The latest in her Ten Stupid Things series, this one about couples is a clunker!I ususally love Dr. Laura's writings. They tend to be down-to-earth guides on having a happier, less complicated life. But not this one.As I turned every page, I hoped for some of the great examples and wise teachings that I learned to expect from her other books. It is full of examples from her listeners, but it lacks the wisdom that should bring the examples into a meaningful thesis. The examples don't alway exemplify her points, and there are so many quotations from listeners that they lose their impact. Some even seem to contradict the very point she is trying to apply! About halfway through the book I wondered if Dr. Laura hadn't written the book just to clear out her ""clever quotation"" file.None of the good, simple advice on relationships, or passages about how good morals make good neighbors. Really, just a scrapbook of incohesive thoughts. Sigh."
2,Does Doctorow know when to end a sentence ?,"Doctorow's initial sentence in his Civil War novel rivals the length in distance Sherman's army covered decimating the South. Is it flow of consciousness or simply poor syntax that prompted the author to string together 168 words,separated by 21 commas, before finally giving the reader a chance to breathe by mercifully inserting a period.This verbiage is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to piloting your way through this somewhat disjoined and cumbersome historical novel.It will take patience and persistence to complete this tome."
1,A Considerable Waste of Time,"I read this book for my book group (who usually chooses good books) and found it to have little to its credit. It has a thin, disjointed plot, mostly weakly drawn, incomplete characters who come and go in a somewhat willy-nilly fashion, (many of them I was not quite sure why they were included at all) poor dialog (without so much as a single "" in the entire book), more sentence fragments than an entire freshman English class could write, and no sense of motivation, place, or time.I read historical fiction expecting to find not facts so much as a perspective and an enhanced understanding of the period. What was it like to live at this time? How did events impact people? Who were these people, what was it like to be them, and how was it to live in their world? What did they think and feel about what was going on around them? Why did they do what they did? etc? I found satisfying answers to none of these questions in this book."
1,DISSAPOINTING,"After approximately 70 pages I had to stop listening to this book. The prose is so florid it's practically tropical. It's as if Tennessee Williams was writing about the Civil War. I was greatly looking forward to some quality historical fiction. Unfortunately there isn't much of that. But it is full of soap opera characters who never are more than 2-dimensional, characters the author has rendered very badly. . When I had to hear about Sherman wondering (at length)if the dead dream, I sensed I was in big trouble. The author's approach is utterly baffling. A good author doesn't give General Sherman dopey things to think about. He provides a quality story w/ engrossing characters. There's none of that here sadly."
2,A fragmented soap opera,"A psuedo-romance novel set inside Sherman's march to the sea and beyond. The disjoined story lines lead to a fragmented novel that reads like the script from a daytime TV soap opera. There is little historical insight or significance; in fact, quite the opossite, with the fabrication of events that didn't happen(assination attempts of Sherman??). Not recommended for fans of the civil war."
3,A conflicted viewpoint,"I was quite conflicted about THE MARCH. There is much to recommend it, Doctorow is a master at capturing the atmosphere of another time; the dialogue rings true and you truly get a sense of being part of another time. Historical figures like Sherman The characters, on the other hand, seem contrived and predictable. Pearl, the slave who can pass for white, Dr. Sartorius, the doctor with modern ideas about medicine, and Arly and Will, who start as comic relief and then make a transition that is too far fetched to be believed, all seem to be from a potboiler like MANDINGO as opposed to a work by Doctorow. OK, that's a bit harsh, as even with stock characters, Doctorow still recreates a country in the final throes of civil war better than most writers could, but because it is Doctorow my expectations are very high and THE MARCH just didn't meet these expectations."
3,Historically correct,Good book that could have ended a whole lot sooner than it did. I felt that I was slogging along with the troops and tired of that after the first few miles.
3,Not true to the times,I looked forward to reading this book. I was very disappointed. The characters were not true to life or to the times. I was amazed also to find out that General Beauregard took over from General Johnson after the Battle of Atlanta. It would not have taken Mr. Doctorow more than ten minutes to find out it was General Hood.
2,Skip this one.,"If you want to read good historical fiction I would suggest that you read ""Widow Of The South"" by Robert Hicks and skip this one. I have read both and the ""Widow"" is much superior, in my opinion. ""March"" jumps from one scene to another and does not really generate much interest in any of them."
5,Please another hundred or so pages,What a lovely novel. I cared about every one of the characters. I would have liked another hundred or so pages so that we could continue to get to know the characters better.
2,don't bother,"This book was so basic as to be worthless to me. I bought the 'two' book package that is often advertised.The other book is called ""Great Jobs for Criminal Justice Majors"" and is more in-depth and helpful. I hate to post something so negative about a book but I just didn't find it worthy of the ten or eleven bucks I spent on it."
3,Quality of DVDs,"The ""Little Miss Broadway"" DVD kept freezing up and would not play properly. Can you send another copy of it to the same address?"
5,"If you like Shirley Temple, you'll love these movies.","This volume includes all of the movies mentioned. Each DVD allows you to select whether you would like to watch it in black and white or color. My nephew who is a fourth grader actually really liked it, so I think that makes it wonderful. It's cute, really clean, and has lots of singing. If you look for movies like that, you'll love this collection. I have all of the volumes and recommend them all. The picture and sound quality are great!!!"
1,incorrect video format,"Despite ordering from a European country the D.V.D.set as supplied is in the NTSC format and I have not been able to view.Can the set be supplied in PAL format,as in use in Ireland and so as to able to view in this country. My grandchildren have been most disappointed."
1,Misleading....don't make a mistake!,"Believe me and the other reviewers, this is not DJ Sasha. I was in the process of ordering this disc, and happened to see it in a local cd store...don't waste your money. This is the European pop Sasha, not the greatest DJ to ever grace America's shores from Europe."

5,Wonderful book for making Thanksgiving special,"I love this book by Barbara Rainey. We get so much mis-information about the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving, but Mrs. Rainey sets it all straight with her much-researched book. It's easy to share with friends and family with a wonderful CD of ""Thanksgiving carols"" to get you excited about Thanksgiving, instead of it marking the beginning of the Christmas season!"
5,"Guitar mastery--nay, wizardry--of the highest order","After listening to this glorious music many times over, I wonder why this man is not an international superstar. The master of a singular guitar style--widely imitated, never duplicated, let alone surpassed--Sekou Diabate still remains a figure of some obscurity. Yes, he has a reputation among cognoscenti of Guinean popular music, most accessibly purveyed through the group Bembaya Jazz, around since 1961 (!). Yet one wonders why a player of his accomplishment nevertheless languishes is relative obscurity.This self-taught master of acoustic/electric guitar, who has forged a sound uniquely his own, a kind of amalgam of kora and balafon styles adapted to guitar and filtered through West African popular music approaches, surely belongs atop any delineation of guitar herodom. One detects everything from country blues to Bayou to reggae to sui generis Africanisms in his uniquely crafted approach to his instrument.Pure joy."
5,Wow!,"I'm 12, and I love reading. I can with out a doubt say this is one of the best books I've read, and I've read alot of other great books. Just the way he would put the letters, and the diary pages in the book, and the pictures were gorgeous. So, If you like historical books I would definatly recomend this book"
5,Surprisingly Awesome,"I absolutely love this album! its so different and innovative. when you're listening to it, it almost sounds like a soundtrack; any of their songs would work great in a movie. my personal favorite is 40'; great beat, great lyrics, great song. i highly recommend this album to anyone who even likes just one of their songs, you wont be disappointed."
3,Average,"Franz Ferdinand is a good band, no doubt, but probably not so much my style. I bought the CD because I loved the song ""Take me Out"", but unfortunately there aren't many other songs on the album that are so appealing. Just be aware that what you've heard of Franz Ferdinand is not exactly what you will be getting."
3,"Good, catchy music, but there are problems","I bought this album about two weeks ago after seeing the video for take me out on a public music station (not something I normally do, but I've been looking for new stuff lately. The first few days of listening to them I thought that it was ridiculously catchy music, and all was good. But after a few more days it just sort of got repetive (and I hadn't even been listening to it nonestop during those days. Mostly I think the fault lies with the drummer, who never really does anything new or different from any of the songs before. Overall the album could stand to be a lot more varied. I would hesitate heavily to call these guys the saviors of rock and roll, or to compare them to any of the greats of the past (but that's partly because I hate to compare bands) but there are some very good tracks on here, and I might consider buying there next album if they change up a few more things."
5,This review has been brought to you by:Cantalope,"I absolutely LOVE this CD,even my MOM likes it.If you don't have this CD YOU my friend are missing out on great freaking musik!!!!"
2,Not aging so well,"2 1/2These boys managed to do the whole indie retro thing without much humiliation, but only but only a few years later, the Euro-snootiness masquerading as witty band interplay which embedded this debut with heavy buzz has seemed to wear thin, making the band's limitations seem even more apparent."
4,Indie - sounding Euro pop/rock hails to previous time,"Franz Ferdinand is a truly interesting album. When I first started listening to it, I didn't know what to think of it. It was recommended to me since I'm a huge Scissor Sisters fan. They are not at all alike in their sound. Once I got past that assumed similarity and listened to them on their own merit, I started to ""get"" them.Sometimes sounding like Blur, early Thompson Twins, Generation X, and early new wave (in general), they are actually a group that can stand on its own. Their songs are catchy, if not hummable, and they have a very unique song to song quality while maintaining a similar creative thread throughout.This is definitely Euro music - which is definitely my preference.Punkish and Europop mixed together. It works. Check it out!"
3,confused but promising debute...,"""Take me out"" is a song equally brilliant as the hype around the band, but there is not another song that reaches the extas of the single ""take me out"" and let me tell you something, that's not a good thing... I would say that the bands first self titled album is a classic first album. The band has a couple of other good songs with a little New york dolls vibe over them, i'm talking about ""Michael"" and ""Jacueline"". Half of the albums songs is good or at least promising for the future but i'll save my praising to the next album. And another thing being from sweden that i recognize is the swedish producers strong ifluences from swedish bands such as Atomic Swings -Stone me into the groove and the ark, the hives and so on. Anyway if you're at all interested in music i suggest that you check the ferdinands out, at least they'll blow you away with one song."
4,Monochrome Set II?,"While lots of people have compared Franz Ferdinand to Interpol, the Rapture, Strokes, the Pixies, etc., the most obvious reference for me is early material by the the 80s art-punk band The Monochrome Set. Some moments even remind me of Adam & the Ants. I certainly recommend checking out Monochrome Set to fans of this cd and to fans of the previously mentioned references. Franz Ferninand are one of the better modern post-punk bands; however, they are somewhat overrated, and though their songwriting is truly wonderful, they are still rather derivative like the rest."
1,THEIR SINGLE IS A RIP-OFF,"I can't believe I'm the only person I know who noticed that the main riff, which carries the entire song, of ""Take Me Out"" is a blatant ripoff of Led Zep's ""Trampled Underfoot"". I'm so tired of bands becoming popular by stealing old music and re-releasing it to people who aren't old enough (or are far too lazy/stupid) to have heard it the first time around. I have a huge problem with bands becoming famous by stealing other people's work, and it surprises me that no one else I know has noticed this none-too-subtle musical theivery. PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD!!!"
1,INTERPOL Cheats ANYBODY,"I do not know but after listening to Franz Ferdinand I noticed that they are a complete rip off of Interpol, and a bad one since after 10-15 listening you will hate them, do yourslef a favor go get interpol that is where they got their inspiration example. Interpol ""Slow Hands. http://www.matadorrecords.com/interpol/music.htmlsounds a lot like ""darts of pleasure"" What they did was take the goth and dark sound of Interpol put a lot of pop hooks on the songs and call it party rock , sounds like the bizzaro nsyncAnd the name of song number five ""Auf Ashce"" partly copied from the group the german group Rammstein complete posers which they also have copied from with the heavy riffs listen to ""Ich Will"""
5,This is a great CD,"I first heard Franz Ferdinand on the radio with their catchy single 'Take Me Out' which has a great guitar riff and a funky beat. I bought the CD not knowing what to expect, but i was extremely happy with it. Franz Ferdinand provides 12 tracks of amazing music, that makes you want to get up and dance to, sing along with your friends to, or just rock out to by yourself. The album starts out with 'Jaquelin' on a mellower start only to explode into a fast paced song. Then the catchy riffs of 'Tell Her Tonight' and 'Take Me Out.' The album then goes into a faster pace with 'Dark of the Matinee', 'Auf Acshe', and 'Cheating on You' before busting out sing alongs like 'This Fire', 'Darts of Pleasure' and my favorie 'Michael' Mellowing out with 'Come on Home' before ending with musical genius of '40'. This CD is packed with amazing guitar, great lyrics, a smooth voice, and catchy beats to go along with it, this CD is definately worth the buy."
4,guilty pleasure,"Is Franz Ferdinand the savior of popular music? No. But neither are the 5000 other bands out there who have been described as such. But I like FF upon first listen. Make no mistakes, it is dance/pop with a nice early 80s feel to it. Nothing more, nothing less. But the music has great hooks and I find myself singing along. The reviewer who described this as a ""guilty pleasure"" hit close to the mark for me. Definitely worth the $12."
3,Mildly interesting,"Mildly interesting music on this debut album from the current flavor of the month band. They are derivitive, their sound was ripped off from the Scottish band Josef K among others, yet they're OK. I didn't turn them off when I heard them on the radio. But they really don't do much for me. Its just more moderately rocking guitar pop with verse chorus verse songwriting and an odd (for pop) rhythmic sensibility. Ooh they have some homoerotic undertones, big deal. Anybody heard of David Bowie or his song ""John I'm Only Dancing""? Bisexual chic was old by 1973. In any case they don't move me much, and they don't make me want to dance. People who gave this five stars (wtf?!?!) are either very easy to please or haven't heard any music from before 2001. Will anyone care when they release their third album? (let alone their second), we'll see.Update 2012Told you so."
3,"not bad,not good","these guys sound like the ""plugged-in""Violent Femmes. everything sounds very familiar,but atthe same time not-to awful either. pick theseguys up if your curious looking for somthing new,otherwise there are hundreds of bands past and presentthat have already mined this territory, only they didn'thave the same ""visual"" style as f.f. that's the only diff."
3,cheating on you,"i really don't understand what the hype is all about. Out of 11 songs, only 5 stand out: take me out, the dark of the matinee, darts of pleasure, Michael and auf achse. Those songs may be fun to dance to but the album isn't worth it. Go for the single instead."
4,"4.5 stars: To take you ""out"" of your routine musical habits","The indie scene has become a bit crowded this year... or maybe it's always been so and we've only just become more aware of it lately. Among Interpol, Modest Mouse, The Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie, Grandaddy and other acts in this realm, Franz Ferdinand flashes some interesting signs of musical creativity all the way from across the Atlantic, in Scotland. With a sound that reminds of Interpol at times, their self-titled album is able to keep you interested all the way through it, and all the way through many listenings... plus it has that sticky factor that most other indie acts seem to be missing. With a largely guitar-based sound, this Scottish band is one to keep an eye on, as long as they don't get hooked on a formula. And in the meantime, they are a sure way to take you ""out"" of your routine musical habits."
4,Indie rock? Maybe,"As a recent newcomer (I will admit it) to the indie rock scene, when I first listen to this CD I thought it was a good addition to this year's music. I listened to it endlessly, enjoying the rhythmic beats of such songs as ""Darts of Pleasure"", ""40'"" and even their single ""Take Me Out"".Imagine my surprise when I turned on VH1 to find that their video for the above-mentioned video was in VH1's Top Twenty Countdown. Was this the indie end for Franz Ferdinand? Some seemed to think so. But maybe not.If you are looking for a solid indie CD I would suggest looking elsewhere (to Interpol or The Shins ) but if you are looking for a good semi-pop with indie influence album look no further."
3,Summery,"""Take Me Out"" is a great song, no two ways about it. One that will always remind me of this summer, much like the White Stripes' ""Seven Nation Army"" defined last summer. However, the rest of the album is just not very exciting to me. Too derivative and lightweight. Fun, yes, but the balance of the songs fade quickly from memory, much as the CD made a quick exit from my CD changer."
5,wooo---ROCK!,"All the songs in this album are fantastic!! Franz Ferdinand is an incredibly talented band that creates fearless music! They respect many different genres of music and they aren't (...) enough to say so. So, you see, you dimwitted metal rock punktards, you don't have to publicly hate pop music to be successful. No fear!!! wooo! music! wooo! WOOO!!! WOOOOOOO!!!"
4,The Stratocaster Chronicles,"Very informative book about the history of the Fender Stratocaster guitar as well as the famous players who love this guitar. Good info about Leo Fender the creator, his time as owner of the company and the era in which CBS purchased the company from Leo. Lots of great photos. I highly recommend this book if you are a Fender player who wants to know the background on this product."
3,Book is awesome CD is dreadful,"The book is well written and many great phots, the cd on the otehr hand is really bad, the author of that cd is just plain childish, I threw mine out, the book is worth the price alone,"
5,nice book,"a nice history of the evolution of the strat,with a cd of examples,a quick read and nice pictures of guitars and players."
4,A very good overview of pharmacology,"This book is a good reference for people who have just started on pharmacology. It give a very good overview of the general classifications of drugs including side effects, contraindications, and nursing interventions. I suggest that you buy the study guide along with it as it can help you review the concepts."
5,A Must Read for Everyone!,"Why does this book wind up ""missing"" from public and school libraries?It is probably one of the most relevant books for YA and adults to read together and discuss today.As this book disappears in libraries, it is a great choice for online access at public libraries -- then many more people will have the pleasure of reading this most important and thought-provoking book.The concepts covered in this book are definitely important book to discuss with up-and-coming generations..."
5,When you need help - ask the professional!,"Whether you just love comics or intend to start writing some yourself, you'll probably need a helping hand. Will Eisner might just be the right hand for you. As a true pro, who's been in the field since 1930, he might just have the kind of hints, tips and interesting details you need to know as a beginner. Graphic Storytelling will reveal to you the world of telling a story in drawings and words combined, the art of comics and caricature. In my very humble opinion, this book is one giant step forward for you, on the way of expressiong yourself on paper. And hei, if Neil Gaiman recommends it, who am I to say anything else?"
1,Can't say,"Actually this product never arrived, thanks to some bungling at UPS, which resulted in the rug being sent back without ever getting to us. We ordered a different rug with pattern, and feel that we are happier with it than the plain version we originally ordered."
4,Nice Rug,"This rug is nice. The color is good. The quality of the border material is nice. We ended up returning it because it was too big for our space. Also, because the main field is so plain, we were worried we would see every spot on it."
5,Hats off to Hanson,"It took me a long time to come across the works of Howard Hanson. His work is well worth the wait. I've now heard two different versions of his 2nd Symphony and this one is the superior interpretation. (Of course, I'm from Seattle, so maybe there's a bit of bias here). Like Caesar Franck's Symphony in D minor, Hanson has one main theme that he repeats throughout. One would think that this could easily become tiresome and cloying, but the opposite occurs. It's hypnotic, mesmerizing and beautiful.The Nordic Symphony is quite good too. It has a heroic sound that is extroverted while the 2nd Symphony has a heroism of its own that speaks more of an inner reality.There is only one thing that bothers me about this recording and it has nothing to do with the music. What's up with the photo of Gerard Schwarz and his middle finger? Some photo editing was badly needed here!"
1,Author attempts to take all the fun out of Perl,"The author has compiled a list of arbitrary recommendations (""use four-column indention levels"", ""don't use the 'unless' statement"", ""always use the /x flag on regexes""). You are bound to gain more from almost any other Perl book out there which explores the language and not the author's pet peeves."
2,It just shows you can't judge a book by its cover blurb!,"Appears to be raggedly edited interviews. And while it touches on the books that various authors claim have ""changed their ""lives"" its rarely clear in what ways. Picked this for a book club book, most didn't care for it."
2,What good are stainless steel blades...,"...when the hinge in the middle is made of regular steel that rusts out in six months?The scissors themselves work great, but after only a few months of use, they started to get harder and harder to use. I popped off one of the middle caps, and RUST. The hinge isn't stainless at all. It's only a matter of time before the two halves come apart."
3,Has anyone checked these figurines for Lead in the paint?,"I am just wondering, as this is another Made in China product, if the figurines have been checked for lead paint? Anyone know, I am reluctant to purchase it if the figurines are toxic."
5,good price fast delivery,this is the cheapest place that we found Parenthood season 2. it was delivered fast. if you are hunting for parenthood this is the place to buy it.
2,Disc missing an episode,"I LOVE this show. This review is for quality of the DVD, not content. I bought this for my mom. She is enjoying the shows, but some of the epidodes are either missing or mislabeled on the disc. The one listed as Episode 7 is a repeat of Episode 6. The one listed as Episode 9 is actually Episode 7. So Episode 9 is missing, unless it shows up as another episode later in the disc, which they haven't finished watching. But presumably at least one episode is missing completely, since Episode 6 was on it twice."
5,Realistic Life Stages,"These replicas of a butterfly's life stage are a great assest in the classroom. The students are able to closely examine the replicas and really understand each stage more clearly. My son got a hold of these before I could bring them to my classroom. He is 3 and he enjoyed looking at each piece. Eventhough, he didn't understand all of the stages he knew about caterpillars and butterflies. These would be great for a classroom and/or for a child who is interested in the world around him/her."
3,Junky é ainda o grande livro,"Legal, mas nem tanto. Se vc é a sua primeira leitura de Burroughs deixe esse pra depois e compre o Junky."
3,Ok 4th solo album From Celly Cel,"After 2 years since his last relases and leaving Jive/Sick Wit it Records he returns with an ok album. My least favorite of his first 4 solo albums. As always his lyrics are ok but the production on this one isn't really up to par either. Of the 13 songs, I skip 1, 4 are pretty good, and the others are ok. Production is handled by G-Man Stan on 3 songs, Charlie Doyle on 8 , and D.J. Fingaz, and Bosko each do 1. Guests are on 4 songs rapping and do the hook on 2 others. If you're a huge fan of his check it out, otherwise I'd pass it up, it's not his best work.#1 - short intro w/ a little bit of rapping#2 - 7 (f/ WC)#3 - 8#4 - 7.5#5 - 8#6 - 7 (f/ J.R.)#7 - 7#8 - 8 (f/ Kurupt)#9 - 7#10 - 6 (f/ Grip)#11 - 7 (f/ Young Bleed)#12 - 8 (f/ J.R. -- good story line)#13 - 7b. Marcellus McCarver -- Vallejo, CACheck all my reviews"
5,AWESOME CAMERA,these cameras are great. EXCELLENT customer service. EXCELLENT night vision. i could not believe how clear and how far you can see at night.i bought 2 of these cameras. 1 didnt work though but CCSG was considerate enough to replace it. and this was after i cut the power cable..i didnt like how it took 8 days top get the cameras. im so used to 2-3 day shipping. hehe but its great. MS4U and CCSG are great companies and today im going to buy 2 more cameras and it is gonna be through them since they gave me excellent service. i think my nexty 2 cameras will have a 4.0mm lens or smaller. this 6.0mm lens means i have to place my cameras further from the target so i can get a wider view.i RECCOMEND this camera to anybody out there that wants a high quality camera for day and night and doesent want to pay over $100.
5,Commodore 128 Basic Programming techniqes,Great book. describes in detail how to program advanced applications. also is a great reference guide if you have just bought a commodore from someones garage sale and are wondering about it's capabilities.
2,A bit light,This book is a bit light on content. Most of it is common sense stuff. But it was inexpensive and can be reviewed quickly.
2,Cheap construction,"I was disappointed in the poor quality of this clock. I had to take it apart after a couple of uses because one of the feet came off, leaving a nut loose inside. The innards are very cheaply made with plastic gears and shoddy assembly. Sorry I bought it."
2,Not Dependable,I purchased two clocks; one for each of my granddaughters to use as a way to be more independent and wake themselves for school. We could not depend on either clock to run all night. They would stop for no reason. I was very disappointed in my purchase. Low quality.
1,Maxiguard Oral Gel - Maxi Waste of Money!!!,"Unless you have a pet that loves terrible tasting medicine, don't get this product. My cat, who suffers from gingivitis, ran everytime I got the bottle out. She gagged when I put it on her teeth. Nasty product. In addition, during the time I used it there was absolutely no change in the condition of her gums."
3,wrong product,"I ordered ""gel"", just like the one in the photo, but I received a spray kind. I didn't have time to return for exchange as I was leaving for a trip and had to have it ready so that my family can take care of my dogs while I was gone.Anyhow, the product is not easy to use as it is hard to spray on dog teeth without spraying around her mouth, or hard to spray on a tooth brush. Gel is better."
3,Budgie-Deliver Us From Evil,"This is the last studio album from the Welsh flyers. Possibly the weakest release from their catalogue. Their sound is very diluted and borders into AOR territory. Not the album to start your collection, but necessary for all those completists out there."
2,not,Not enough info. Dont try to work on the fuel system. Needs more info and pictures of critical parts and processes.
4,sweet,It was really nice quality and stuff like that it came quickly and I liked it. And it is green with a palladium leaf.
3,"Insightful yet wordy in a ""stream of consciousness"" way","I've looked forward to Turner's new book, having read all of her previous ones. I love the way the author intertwines the lives of the characters with each other as we come to know them. In this book Elizabeth is coming to terms with the problems in her marriage as well as confronting some emotional baggage that she has accumulated through the years. Elizabeth's thoughts and feelings are right out there for us to relate to, and in a way that is very descriptive, insightful, honest, and powerful. However,I must agree with some other reviewers who feel that her references to poetry as a way of relating to the events in her life were quite cumbersome. These discourses often cause the reader to suspend thinking about the storyline in order to see where the author is going. I found it quite distracting, but I enjoyed the characterization and story in spite of this drawback."
5,Enchanting,"This book does seem lengthy at first but was far from boring! It reminded me of how much real art can enrich the life, so I'm already looking for some good poetry books. Hard to believe this book is a novel, the thought processes of the main character being so close to reality. I also liked immensely the portrayal of GRACE in a betrayal situation and could easily replace a few counseling sessions. This is one of my favorite books so far."
4,A good read,"The book does ramble, but I enjoyed the ramblings. I didn't like all the characters necessarily or even understand why some were part of the story. However, it was an enjoyable book and she uses some great imagery."
2,This has barely been usable,"The area on the bottom is a pain in the neck, since you have to hold the top to get the zipper to zip. The containers that came with it leaked, and should not be used. I wish I had gone for a simpler kit instead. The material is already starting to show some wear, and I don't think it will hold up to heavy use. When it goes, I will get a plain leather kit."
4,Not perfect,"I have been looking for the right size travel carrier for quite some time. And while this pretty well made and bigger than most, the way it opens and closes is awkward. While I would recommend it just for the size and the underside compartment, it's not perfect."
3,Beware CUTS!,"Be advised that this recording of the Rachmaninoff Symphony No. 2 is full of cuts. While it is true that Racmaninoff would occasionally put cuts into his music when he felt he was in front of a particularly unresponsive audience (he did this with his solo piano music, too), he did not intend to make these permanent cuts in his music. Any recording of this work should be complete, as the composer intended.If the Oregon Symphony wanted to record this music with cuts, they should definitely have announced this on the cover of the CD. Any attempt to cover up this fact is deception."
5,Excellent children's book!,The interesting dolls used in this book make the problems of young Seth easily transferrable to youngsters. This is an excellent book to utilize when teaching children how to deal with their fears!
5,"one of the best smelling, stain fighting detergents out there","This is one of my personal favorite laundry detergents. It stays fresh weeks after you wash. So for those blankets that you use in the winter, when you get them back out in the fall, they still smell fresh. This works reasonably well with stains, and other detergent type uses. Not a bad price for 4 bottles here, check it out, you will like it."
1,Did not work for me,"Did not like this product at all due to comfort issues, I definitely prefer the the pillow w/ coxxyx-cutout over this one."
4,"Love the doll, hate the outfit","I already have Back To School Madison, Chelsea and Barbie but I hadn't planned on buying Nolee because I hate her main outfit. I think the pants and jacket are very boring, but the one-sleeved shirt and miniskirt are cute. I finally did buy Nolee and she's very pretty and I love her cute hairstyle."
4,only one problem,looks good; sounds good; only complaint is the adapter for the IPod Nano does not work - had to modify it for the IPod to fit in and plug into the player.
2,Cheaply made---look for something more solid,"When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time). The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it. I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs). This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced."
4,Great entry level PLC book,"The material covered in this book is great for an entry level class in PLC programming. This appears to be the intent of one of the authors (Robert Filer), having been instructed by him directly using this material."
3,"Admirable, but not really engaging","I'm addicted to historical novels, and had great hopes for this novel before I read it. I was a bit disappointed in the reading of it: while there's no question that Fitzgerald has done her research and is grappling with some weighty issues concerning Romanticism, desire, and the quotidian, THE BLUE FLOWER is hardly engaging or enthralling. It reads mostly like an intellectaul exercise (especially in that its language and syntax reads almost exactly as if it were translated from the German--as if this were Goethe rendered into English). While (for what it is) the book is quite well done, it wasn't what I was hoping for when I picked it up. It seems more like a writer's novel--that is, a novel for other writers to admire--than a book to really enjoy."
1,Yet another pretentious Booker choice,"Seriously folks, if the Booker Prize panel hadn't chosen this as a winner, would it have received such favorable worldwide reviews? This book is really an extremely slight novel masquerading as a serious piece of literature. I read it all the way through only because I couldn't believe that it was really going to continue being so bad--it never improved! A HUGE disappointment."
1,Not half as interesting as the ratings suggest,"On the strength of the ratings and the fact that she won the Booker I bought the book. It really wasn't an interesting read and the character development seemed pretty poor. I, like many of the other reviewers, wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Researche, nothing ventured and little gained.","I don't know what Fitzgerald wanted ""to get at"" in this book. There is not enough ""life"" and ""living"" for us to feel the time and either live in it, or evaluate it for it's Romantic Follies. There is little of the poetic of Novalis, Goethe etc, but some ""understated signposting"" of philosophical interests and perspectives. One feels that there were better books out there this year that were deserving of awards. This book never opened its arms wide enough or peered deep enough to gain a place in our affections."
4,Great history but . . .,"I think your feelings about this book will depend on your expectations. I didn't get it either -- the exploration of genius and the profound meditation of love and loss.But if you appreciate historicals that evoke the life of the time in details and dialogue, this book is a wonderful example of that.I'll read more of Ms. Fitzgerald's books, but I think I'll skip the editorial reviews."
1,"Dull, dull, dull","There I was, trapped on a train, with nothing to read but this book. The reviews had been favorable, so I dove in. Conclusion: it was mind-numbing, with characters who just weren't interesting. I've read 1000 page novels that flowed more quickly and evoked deeper introspection than this one. Clearly, I just didn't get it."
1,not good,"I love this author and would buy anything with her name on it. But this was just a bad book. It was difficult to get into, stay into, and finish. I am sorry to say, but it looks like she need s to slow down a bit."
5,Better than the last one!,"I have been a fan of Darren since Savage Garden days, this CD is not supposed to be released until September 13th, but I borrowed it from a friend that downloads a lot. The first track 'Darkness' is amazing and sets the tone for the whole album. There is more mixing and techno than in his previous works which I normally don't like but it flows well with his voice. I like him because of his beautiful voice and amazing ability to write. I think this collection of songs shows a more personal side of Darren and the emotions conveyed through the songs are ones most of us can relate to. All the songs are great, the weakest one is actually Popular, the first single. It was a good release as the first single since it is catchy but I think the other songs are better. Two thumbs up!"
4,Recommended by two doctors,"While this particular brand wasn't mentioned, both my internist and my urologist told me to start taking cranberry pills for my frequent urinary tract infections I had this summer. You simply can't drink enough cranberry juice to get what you do with these capsules, plus you don't get the sugar that's in most cranberry juice, which is counteractive to getting rid or or preventing infection. Cranberries truly have something in them that makes bacteria slip on through your system rather than growing. These pills are two per dose, and kind of big, but shaped so they're easy to swallow (they aren't THAT big!) but too big to fit in my weekly pill holder."
1,not interested,I had high hopes for this toy but my daughter has no interest in it whatsoever. She doesn't even want to hold it.
4,Piston and the Seattle symphony,"Walter Pistons music should only gain more fans with such masterful renditions as displayed by the S.S.O. with conducter Gerald Schwarz. The 2nd symphony, in particular , are to my ears ,a real moving discovery, and lead me to seek more by this composer, and also to predict that his music will only enjoy more popularity in the years to come."
5,Happy puppy girl!!,"My maltese mix has sensitive paws in the cold. Not only does it protect from the cold but it helped heal one of the cracks she developed. If you need paw protection, this is the product for you!!!"
4,Value for your money,"My medium-sized dog really loved her first winter with all the snow, but she did not like the salt. We live in an urban area and this year, the budget for salt seems high because there was just too much salt on the streets and sidewalks. My dog would run, then pick up one paw to fling and/or lick the salt and ice off her paw. I read about Musher's and tried it. The lavender-like scent is a bit overwhelming but it works. It kept my dog's peds smooth. I gave small tubs to my friends for their dogs and all reported back that it's a good product. It's easy to apply, which helps too. I definitely recommend this product for all dogs."
5,WINTER WALKING PROTECTION.,MUSHER'S SECRET WORKS GREAT. I USE IT ON MY DOG'S FEET A FEW TIMES A WEEK. WE WALK EVERYDAY 3-4 MILES IN THE WINTER IN THE VERY COLD UPSTATE NEW YORK. THIS IS THE BEST STUFF TO PROTECT A DOG'S FEET. IT GOES ON EASY. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL NOT STAIN YOUR CARPET. THE 200 gm TUB IS THE BEST DEAL. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE. IT WORKS GREAT IN WARM WEATHER TO PROTECT AGAINST HOT TARMAC TOO.
2,Didn't work for me!,"After reading the other reviews I was excited to try this. I have a 60lb lab mix who loves to run in the snow. Extreme cold temps and road salt made it painful. I've tried this product a couple times and it did not work for my dog. First the product says it dries in a few minutes after applied. This did not dry and left greasy paw prints on my rug. Also, once out in the snow, it appeared the snow stuck to my dogs feet and he painfully picked up his feet more frequently. My latest attempt was a disaster. After walking on the street, the slushy grime, typical once snow starts to melt, mixed with the Musher's Secret and formed a tar-like consistency stuck between my dogs toes. Wiping his feet did not remove it and only after several washings with Dawn dishwashing liquid did the grime come out. Unfortunately I now have black, greasy paw prints on my good rugs.Am I doing something wrong? Any advice?"
3,paw protector,"The product was exactly as described. great idea for icy paws but my dog didn't care for it too much... It was received very quickly, great attention to shipping! Great wax! at an amazing price for such a well reviewed product! thank you"
3,49.99!?!?!,Saw this on showtime years ago like the other review said not bad not good read somewhere this was originally 3 hours even then wouldnt pay 49.99. Would buy this for a dollar at walmart maybe 5.00 for the 3 hour verision oh yeah check out the fan who looks just like cletus on the simpsons!
1,Useless,"A box of this detergent was purchased for my office. Of course, we don't have a high-end dishwasher, but all we're cleaning is water cups, coffee mugs, silverware and the occasional plate or bowl someone used for lunch. I've never used such a dysfunctional dishwashing soap: if I put too much in, I would find powder residue on the dishes, too little and nothing would get clean.I've read about this being an issue of ""hard water"" - that is, water with a high amount of minerals. You could brush off my review as simply that - but I would recommend staying clear of this particular product. Personally, I'm weary of this entire company after reading about their false claims in Consumer Reports. Some of their products have been known to leave residue - of course the company claims this is harmless, but any company would."
3,"Good reading, some bad choices","If your hobby is music, buy the book, you will find something even if there is some bad choices. Who needs to listen to Britney Spears or Justin Timberlake before you die. I agreed with another reviewer, listen to Suzi Quatro or the Runaways before you die and listen to a lot of psychedelic music too, it will blow your mind and then you will die happy.I rate the book 3 stars because there is so many artists that should be mention in the book instead of others and they are not."
1,A waste of time,"This was my first Clive Cussler book and will probably be my last. The plot was scattered with no consistent character development. Despite the accolades given to ""Dirk Pitt"" he seemed to be absent in much of the novel. I was very disappointed and I'm still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about Clive Cussler!"
4,still an entertaining read,"as a reader of cussler since discovering ""raise thetitanic"" back in 1977, i eagerly await the release of a new dirk pitt adventure. and this book will satisfy the many longtime fans of the series hungering for more tales from cussler. however, for me, the last few books while still quite good, have not quite been on a par with his best work, from vixen 03 to roughly treasure. maybe i'm familier enough with cussler and pitt to anticipate where he's going, but it seems i can figure out where the plot is going, or how dirk will get out of his next seemingly impossible situation. perhaps it's because the plot twists are becoming too familier- dirk faces certain doom, wiles his way out of it only to face even greater odds. perhaps i expect too much. still, spending several hours with a new dirk pitt book is a very enjoyable way to spend an evening."
3,A decent attempt to continue the Dirk Pitt saga,"I have read all of Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures, and this one is the least action packed of all. I think there was too much fluff, and not enough action. I found it rather difficult to keep focused on the book, unlike all of the other books. I will continue to read Cussler's Dirk Pitt books, but my anticipation of the books has started to fade."
4,A book of adventure,"Flood Tide John Henry Beddingfield Clive CusslerUnknown Waters. 1948. An old cruise liner the Princess Dou Wan is on its final voyage. It is caught in a violent storm the hull is ripped apart, and the ship sinks with its mysterious cargo on board.Dirk Pitt is relaxing on a lake when he discovers an illgeal immigration project and rescues beatiful INS agent Julia Lee. Dirk Pitt and Julia Lee are on a race up the Mississippi River to stop the sinister villain Qin Shang, so he won't change the face of America. They are also racing to find the cargo of a cruise liner that sunk over fifty years ago. I give this book a four star rating becauseit is a typical Cussler book. Good guy wins, good guy gets the girl, and beats the bad guy. I liked this because of the non-stop suspense and the plot that thickens on every page you turn. If you have any comments on my book please E-mail me a henjohn@dtccom.net"
2,Better than nothing,"The latest adventure of Bond, James--oh, I'm sorry! I mean Pitt, Dirk Pitt. James Bond and Dirk Pitt are completely different. One is an Englishman working for the British Secret Service. The other is an American working for the water department. They have nothing in common other than traveling the world, playing with expensive gadgets, falling in (brief) love with fiesty heroines, and saving the day in an action packed climax. I don't know how I could have confused the two. But I digress from a review of the book.An evil Chinese businessman has a nefarious plot at hand to take over the United States. Dirk Pitt stops him. Lots of water is involved. The end."
2,ho hum,"Although I am a big Dirk fan, I felt that this book fell flat. It just never seemed to catch fire. I enjoyed the total lunacy of 'Sahara' so much more."
4,do the means justify the ends?,"I liked this book a lot. It took me FOREVER to read, but that's because I was really busy. The story moved fairly quickly, with the usual background before the actual story. The images that were evoked during the course of this book were hair raising--from Orion Lake to the Great Lakes.In this book, Dirk fights the dastardly Chinese multi-billionaire Qin Shang. Qin Shang is importing illegal Chinese immigrants, and is also in pursuit of priceless Chinese artifacts. Dirk is also fighting the White House, and his injured/tired body.All in all, a good read--sure Cussler has a ""formula"" going, but that doesn't stop him from crafting a great story with many twists and turns."
4,Dirk Pitts gets stupider but more exciting.,"In my opinion, this was a well written book and contained the best action scenes in a Cussler book so far. I was upset, however, with the simplicity of the plot. I figured out what was going on before Dirk Pitt did and that sort of ruined the story a little for me. Any Cussler fans will still be delighted to read it."
5,This book was so exciting I couldn't put it down!,I bought 6 books at the same time and I would have to say this one was the most exciting of them all. I love a good mystery and this book measures up in all respects.
5,Challenges a great many religious preconceptions,"In 1945, twelve ancient texts were found in a sealed jar at the base of an Egyptian cliff. One of these, The Gospel of Thomas, is presented an expert translation accompanied with extensive interpretation in this impressive edition of The Gospel Of Thomas Annotated & Explained by Stevan Davies (a learned professor who has intensively studied the Gospel of Thomas for over twenty years). This is a seminal work that challenges a great many religious preconceptions within Christian literature and Biblical Studies. The Gospel Of Thomas offers a unique and sometimes contradictory perspective on the Kingdom of God (claiming that it is here and now rather than a future promise or threat), and sheds new light on the perception of Jesus Christ. The Gospel Of Thomas Annotated & Explained is very highly recommended reading for anyone seeking to better understand the these long-hidden aphoristic words attributed as the teachings of Jesus Christ."
4,Nice !,The sixth season has an interesting bit of content beautifully presented.Many of the anologies presented are well thought out- keep em coming.
3,More polemic than adventure tale,"Reinhold Messner is of course a legend in mountaineering. This book recounts his climb of Nanga Parbat in 1970 with his brother Gunther and a team formed by Dr. Karl Maria Herligkoffer. It is really Messner's explanation of the events that led to Gunther's death on the mountain, illumintated by his grief over the loss of his beloved brother. Of course the disputes over these events will never be resolved, many of the participants are now dead, but Naked Mountain is an act of contrition and catharsis for Messner more that a readable tale of adventure. The language seems somewhat dated and artificial, but I suspect this is due to translation issues. Overall I would rate this book a moderate plus for readers of mountaineering literature."
5,Incredible Story by an Incredible Writer!,"Christofferson tells us so vividly about the life of Gaylord Nelson. His prose has such flow that you don't really realize you're reading a biography until you have finished reading the book! The life of Nelson is truly an incredible one, and Christofferson does a magnificent job of relaying that life and the history of Earth Day to the reader. This is a ""must"" book, not just for the nature lover or the environmentalist, but also for those who want to learn about the real, behind-the-scenes heros of our great country. A book to read, indeed!"
2,All I Can Say..,"All I can say is THANK GOD I RENTED IT AT THE LIBARY instead of wasting my money on it this time. I have bought 5 other books of Sylvia's and I am finding that most of her material is either recyled from her other books, or ""borrowed"" from other great mediums of the past such as Ruth Montgomery, or Jane Roberts (The Seth Material)."
5,Sylvia is right on the money,"After having lost my son almost a year ago, I found SylviaBrown's ""Visits From the Afterlife:"" comforting.I have had experiences off and on all my life, usually unaskedfor.One very recently. I was in Sedona killing time while mysister and friend were having pyschic readings done. I thoughtI would have an aura photo done.The person came in, told me where to sit, adjusted the cameralooked through the lens, looked at me and stopped. We hadn'tspoken except for the where to sit part.She asked me if I knew I had two people standing behind me.A tall young man and an older shorter man, whom the young manseemed to know very well.It was my son and father-in-law, they showed up as shapesin my photo. Both had passed in 2004. The photographer, alsopyschic I learned later, said they were smiling and waving for the camera.So Sylvia does not make these things up, she is, in herown way, telling it like it is."
3,It never ceases to amaze me,"How books are trashed by people based on their personal and limited biases.The negative reviews above are by two reviewers who have only two reviews and both are ... you know ... negative, but they add their one or two stars and scathing remarks and an important study is made to look shallow, foolish, and unworthy of being read. This is the inadequacy of the rating system. Thank Goooood for the Herbert L.Calhoun's of Amazon."
3,"Good introduction to White Privilege, but not very detailed/in depth","This book is a brief wake up call to whites, asking them to confront their own privilege. It's honest and to the point, but does not provide too much analysis (it's less than 100 short pages, I finished it in a couple hours). My lower rating is due to the lack of analysis, not the quality of ideas, with which I mostly agree."
4,True story,"Not many are aware but the movie is based on a true story that occured 6/89 in Gravesend, Bk. Tragic accidental shooting of a friend of mine. The movie depicts the event very accurately. Its worth watching. Not available in no stores or other mailorders. Good for the 16-36 range. Email me if your interested in more info on the event or the movie some more."
2,interesting movie,"This movie is made with a low budget which is clearly visible the story is really good but the special effects are really terrible.For the money you pay, it's good enough"
4,Quite good,"I'm really 14 but I can't be bothered to register... Most of the songs here are pretty good, except for Flying Without Wings, Bellossom and the really CRAP Polkamon. Blah Blah Blah, They Don't Understand and Dreams are my faves, due to their catchy tunes and the fact that two of them are about kids getting looked down on for playing the Pokemon game. I can relate to THAT... PS The theme tune (Pokemon World) is better here than on the cartoon!"
4,Pichu Forever,"Finally a cd with the music from the movie 2000 on it. The dance of the bellossom is at it's best with this wonderfuly made cd. The songs have various artists such as Weird Al, or Angela Via; but the most important of all is the 12 year old named Alysha who sand Dreams which is one of the best songs on the cd :) Even though this Cd does not come with any promotional inserts the songs themselves are definatly worth it ......."
1,Quite a disappointment - except for ONE song...,"If there were a ""no star"" rating, I'd give it that. But I can't, because this CD has ONE saving grace: ""Polkamon"" by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. It's peppy, it's fun, it's well written, and Al plays a mean accordion...! Not to mention that one line Al wrote in the lyrics for his diehard fans... you know who you are and what I'm talking about! His talent continues to amaze me. And since ""Polkamon"" can't be found anywhere else, it's well worth the money you pay for the CD, for this one gem of a song. Go buy it... and try not to step on little Pikachu on your way... :)"
1,Sickening,"A father takes the law into his own hands, shooting point blank (with premeditation) two handcuffed men who raped and beat his daughter. This is vigilantism, this is murder. His alcoholic lawyer gets a no-good ""psychiatrist"" to testify that the man is insane even though everyone knows that he is not.A clear-cut case for the death sentence except for one thing: the murderer is black and the victims are white, and the novelist, Grisham, is a white-bashing racist. The murderer is acquitted BECAUSE he is black.Don't bother with this piece of trash."
5,fantastic book,"I read this book after being told about how good it was by my younger cousin. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. The story brutally depicts the contrast between black and white. At times, I would have to grit my teeth in order to restrain myself from yelling at the racism portrayed throughout the book. Out of all the Grisham books I've read: The Pelican Brief, the Firm, and A Time to Kill, I'd have to say that A Time to Kill is definitely my favorite. It was so realistic that I had horrific nightmares about lynchings at night. To anyone that is considering to read a Grisham book, start with this one. It hooks you from the beginning and keeps you gripped until the end."
5,Gotta read it!!!,"This was my second Grisham book,and certainly not my last. I loved it. The suspense was so thrilling that I couldn't bear to put it down. It was one of the most enjoyable books i've ever read. Keep up the excellent work Grisham!!!"
3,Good solid book,"Surprisingly good, considering my first introduction to Grisham was ""The Pelican Brief"" (which I rate a 1). This is Grisham's first novel, and rather well done. The story is about a young lawyer's defense of a black man who kills his young daughter's rapists. I'm not a lawyer myself, but the technical parts sounded good to me. Characters are okay, ending satisfies. Not a totally gripping tale, but a good solid book."
5,A Time to Kill,"I think is the best book I ever read,bein only thirteen. This book well portrayed some of the many hate crimes and racist acts happening today. I couldn't this book down, it was so well written. This book brought tears to my eyes. I hope for the people that read this book understand the things in this story are happening today all over the world."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"If you want to read this book, you should reade ""The Firm"" or ""The Client"" instead. If you already have read ""The Firm"" or ""The Client"", you would probably hate yourself for buying this book!"
5,This truly written book showed both history and feeling.,"This book was very well written. Grisham shows his story insteadof just telling it. He shows the feelings of each of thecharacters, and explains them with great detail. It was asif he knew how it felt to have your ten year old beaten andraped, and how it felt to be a lawyor for such a pressuringcase. The book was so true in my point of view. It showedhow segregation and discrimination affects americans as wellas others around the world, even today. His book describeda lot of history. I would highly reccomend this book toanyone who likes books with a lot of suspence!"
4,John Grisham at His Best,John Grisham has created yet another masterpiece with this thrilling story of a family destroyed by a rape. This was an excellent example of his writing skills.
4,Better Than The Movie,"I saw the movie years ago, but I remember it quite well. I sorta like readingbooks after I see the movie that way I can put an actual face on the characters.The movie was a little different but the story line was the same. Grisham is a talentedwriter but I don't like the way he portrayed blacks in the south as if they are all a bunch of poorignorant folks who walk around singing ""We Shal Overcome"" hell I don't even know thewords to the dam song! All in all it was pretty good for his first book."
2,ugh!!!,"The worst book I've ever read. Insipid, shallow, ridiculous plot. If you want your intelligence to be insulted pick up a copy. John Grisham should not have given up his day job!"
2,The book is slightly better than a bad movie,"I've read all the Grisham books and am amazed that he has such a wide readership. His writing is superficial and stretches credibility. His plot lines have gaping holes (ex: The Client) A Time is his best effort, but he asks his readers to sympathize with a black man who shoots down two manacled white men in cold blood. He may have gained some black readers, but even the most broad-minded whites question his motives in wrliting this book."
2,Dull and boring,"A Time to Kill must have been one of the worst books that I have ever read. A Time to Kill is a book about two men that rape a little girl. The girl's father kills the two men, and risks going to the gas chamber. The reason I didn't like this book is plain and simple. I hate books about politics and court trials. A time to Kill is just that, dull and boring."
5,Guilty or Innocent,"The book A Time to Kill is a great book. The way that we get the character perception is among the best of the best. Jake the lawyer reluctantly takes a murder case for a black man named Carl Lee. Carl Lee killed to boys that had devastated his family. Then Carl Lee was arrested and charged for capital murder. At the trial Jake calls a psychiatrist and he testifies that Carl Lee was insane at the time of the killing. The Prosecution argues that Carl Lee was acting in cold blood. The town of Clanton Mississippi was flooded with news reporters and people waiting to see the trial. The trial goes on and every day it looks more and more like Carl Lee is guilty. But, local radio stations called for rallies for every person willing to come to the Clanton courthouse and lobby for Carl Lee's innocence. Will Carl Lee be found guilty or innocent? Find out by reading A Time to Kill."
4,"ESV Holy Bible ""Blessed"" Purchase","My fiance and I purchased this ESV Hardcover Classic Reference Bible and are so glad that we did. We are getting married next year and the bible has a marriage page to write down dates etc. We plan to use it at our wedding! Also, this is one of our first bibles. We also purchased other additions for our house but if you want a bible that is easy to understand, has a legible font size (not too big or too small) and is made of paper that is not too thin (like most Bibles are) than I would strongly recommend this Bible! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because the text has been changed some to make it more understandable so I would also recommend a Bible closer to the origional text. However, this Bible is beautiful and a good size book and weight for travel etc."
4,Best Text-- Worst Binding,"I absolutely love this translation. However, I've gone through several different editions and after just a few months the binding alsways cracks in the ""W"" section of the concordance. I'm not alon; others have told me stories of the same problem. As much as I love this version, I've had to set it aside for a more reliable all-around Bible (my trusty MacArthur Study Bible) until the publisher can resolve this problem."
5,Action Suspense Drama Romance Mystery And More!...,"If you read this book for no other reason, read it for its entertainment value. Yes, that's right, its entertainment value!... From Genesis To Revelation, the Bible is packed with lots of interesting reading. For a book that was written thousands of years ago, no other book EVER published has sold more copies!... The Bible holds a World Record!... It is the biggest selling book of ALL TIME. And if you read it you will know why. This is a book that inspires, this is a book that can put you on the edge of your seats in suspense. the translation makes it easier to read than before and it's a great gift idea for those getting married or going off to college etc. If you have an empty life, the Bible can change your life. You know I can't help but wonder why people vote no on this review I wrote. But that's ok, the review is on the money. This book is easier to understand than the king james version."
2,Not prime entertainment....,"This is probably the tenth Max Brand paperback I have read, and I must say he definitely has written better novels. The storyline drags. The two main characters, Joe Warder and Dennis MacMore, continuely escape unscathed via highly unlikely circumstances. Max Brand's fantasy is again interlaced in this western, portrayed by Arturo -- the tall, thin man dressed in black with a lean, ugly, long face -- showing up at opportune times with his prophecies. After reading the novel completely through, I reread the first 50 pages and gained a little more appreciation of the paperback. However, if one is looking for reading entertainment, this is not the novel to choose."
4,Fear is the opportunity or courage,"I admire John McCain for a number of reasons, and I found this book to be another.The book ""Why Courage Matters"" is not really about his personal experiences in the Navy, the Hanoi Hilton, or the Keating 5 examination. It was about what other people have done in the face of real fear and discouragement, and how the stood-up to their problems and their oppressors, and how they ultimately persevered.These noted people were not politicians or important people by how we might judge an important person today. These stories of courage are about regular people ... people who have similar hopes and aspirations as most all of us do, and how they dealt with adversity with hope, courage and determination.The book really is an inspiration, and gives us hope that when and if the time may come when we face a significant fear, we will find our own courage and strength to stand up to the adversity, and to remain strong."
2,Large and limited,"I'm a big guy; this should have fit. I always need to buy things extra large, but this is too big. Also, it hits quite high, both front and back, so it is awkward to wear. You aren't able to bend much in the front, and the stays in the back jab the top of your butt. They also tend to push your underwear down! But most importantly, there is - very - little ability to adjust the snugness. There are very thin strips of velcro on the ""adjustment"" belt, so narrow that, basically, you - can't - adjust the thing. I can't get it tight enough. Not a useful purchase!"
4,2nd Film is better but this has its merits,"Though not as good as it's companion piece, Flags takes a unique perspective of WWII. War is depressing, tragic, and horrible. It may be something that we have to participate in because of circumstances, but I think the message is that it isn't a simple solution and the price is high. The film does suffer from lack of good characters which is surprising for an Eastwood film. I liked the battle scenes and thought they were well done. Overall Saving Ryan was better in some respects, but then it suffered from the contrivance of the German soldier killing the American soldier after he was let go. So yes the film is flawed but still worthwhile."
5,Read the Book but Movie was Better,"Any person interested in WW II or what soldiers went through in the Pacific should see this. Not quite as intense as the Normandy Invasion in Saving Private Ryan, but still very moving and intense. Clint Eastwood did a great job making this movie and stayed as true to the book as possible. I recommend it."
3,good but could have been better,"Superb battle scenes and a good story, but for me the editing left me cold. The film just doesn`t flow and you keep trying to recall who each character is. A directors cut beckons!"
2,I didn't like this movie,Can't really say why but feels like another hollywood attack on war. I was left with a bad feeling at the end.
2,The Cliche Holds True,"More than ever... the Book is Far Better than the movie. The movie was a bit disjointed and didn't really delve into some of what made these men tick. The complexities associated with feelings experienced by the men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima, survived and then went on a war bond tour cannot be done justice on film. Too much detail is missed."
3,What is a Hero?,"This is one of Clint Eastwood's pair of movies about the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II, the other being ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". ""Flags"", as you would guess, tells the American side of the story, from both the battlefield and from the homefront as the ""heroes"" of the famous picture of Marines raising the flag on the island, are escorted around the U.S. in a last-ditch effort to sell war bonds. Eastwood explores many aspects of the nature of heroism, and what keeps troops fighting, which is often not much about heroism at all. Wisely, Eastwood employs unknown actors to play the ""heroes"". There were a few recognizable faces among the brass and stateside players, but primarily Eastwood lets the story carry its own weight. There's a good bit of ""blood and guts"" especially early on as the invasion is depicted, so I'd limit this one to adults and older high schoolers."
3,Flags of our Fathers,War is hell and thats what shows in this movie. Its also about the men who raised the flag and how the government used them to raise money.
1,Terrible,"To put it in short, this movie is just terrible. I saw some of Clint Eastwood's other films, which I thought was of high standard. There was no character development in this movie, no depth and it follows a typical recipe, which so many other war movies followed in the past. It leaves no excitement and doesn't stay in one's thoughts afterwards."
1,A Movie that Soils True American Heroes.,"I have been a lifelong Clint Eastwood fan, until I watched this mockery of a war film. First off, there is very little actual war in this war movie, the movie centers on the bond drives at home. The Bond drives are made to look as if the evil American government was extorting money to continue their pointless war overseas. This is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" it does not even come close. Eastwood has taken his feelings about the war in Iraq and imposed them on a heroic struggle that happened 60 years ago. I feel bad for the Americans who fought and died on Iwo Jima, this film cheapens and de-legitmizes their experience. Eastwood should apologize to the remaining veterans of Iwo Jima, just as long as he apologizes to the Americans and not the Japanese."
4,the real story of the twin towers,This Movie felt like the real story coming alive all over again & againit seems like I was there.
5,"Aaahhh, yessir...","The Good Doctor Professor Longhair in a duo setting with conga drummer Alfred 'Uganda' Roberts. It just can't get any better than this. These two heavy gentlemen work their way through Longhair's greatest hits in a glorious live recording. Every keyboard trick is heard to the utmost advantage, and the beat never quits. Run out and buy this record."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I returned this product twice; once for a replacement and the second time for a refund. My research pointed to this camera as being able to meet my needs, however it did not. One was a feature oriented problem, in that it took way too long to cycle between photos. I missed some really good memories at my son's high school graduation because of that. More importantly, both cameras had lens problems that manifested in opaque circles showing up in photos that had a solid background. Sorry, but this camera just did not make the grade. I ended up with a Canon."
2,Oily and not much lather,For all of you that thought I liked everything...I found something that I don't like. It doesn't lather enough and loses lather too quickly for me. I will give you that I shave most of my face and a full head of hair. That is quite a bit. Other soaps stand up to it though and this doesn't cut it. I also don't like the oil slick floating on the water when I'm done. Sorry but not for me.
1,this book is pathetically stupid.,"I just read all the reviews of this book... it has great writing, i agree, it's pretty interesting, okay, but five stars??? give me a break. This book is about the lamest excuse for a historical fiction novel i've ever seen. Right off the bat it's improbable. And ""WetSteel""? What the hell is that all about? Anyway, this book drove me completely bonkers because i've studied the ""titanic"" explicitly and any moron with half a brain knows that there is no 300 foot gash in the side of the sunken ocean liner. And, more obviously, that it would be completely impossible to ""raise the titanic"" because it's lying in two seperate pieces! Maybe other people can stand reading historical inaccuracies, but if you're like me, and seeing something incorrect bothers you, do NOT read this book...it'll make you want to scream with frustration from the very beginning."
3,A tamer pitt,"Of all pitt novels this one a the least amount of action from dirk. It reads more like a spy novel containing subtleties of espionage and double crosses. Reveals a more human side of dirk and less the superhero. Great read, mr. Cussler never disappoints!"
3,"Come on, now","Cussler novels are always a little out there in their plots, but the simplicity with which they raise the Titanic makes this one pretty unbelievable."
4,Raise the titanic,I like Dirk Pitt adventures and this was one that pecked the imagination. It brought you to a imaginary dream type of world that has you thinking if it was possable to do something like this.
2,Although I love Cussler's work I have to give it 2 stars,"I've read a lot of negative reviews regarding this novel. Granted its not Cusslers best work, but there are sections I like. The triumphant Titanic entering New York harbor is breathtaking in my opinion. Still, if you want to read Clive at his best try TREASURE or DRAGON. Great books."
4,very good,"this is my first Clive Cussler book, and it was superb! Page turning, chilling, and awsome and the plotline follows to the end!"
1,The worst book I've ever finished,"When I was a little kid, I'd see this book on the shelves at the library and in used bookstores and wonder what masterful tale was contained inside, and yet somehow I never managed to pick it up. 20 years later I finally splurged and got it for a dollar at the library book sale, and read the whole thing cover to cover on a transpacific flight.Oh, man! What I had been missing! Some of the worst dialogue ever committed to paper, the most appalling junk science since ""The Core,"" and gratuitous sex scenes that made me actually laugh out loud. Dirk Pitt is like Doc Savage -- only twenty times smarter and stronger! The fact that this one reached the NY Times bestseller list makes you question the fate of humanity.Good for a laugh or two, especially with some of the utterly ludicrous scenes near the end (don't forget that sultry strip-tease, seemingly written by a ten-year-old), but probably not worth it in the long run unless you're a fast reader."
5,Great way to get power to a remote location,"I needed to run a table saw in my garage, which has a single 15-amp circuit, but my garage is detached from the house. This high-capacity extension line alllows me to connect the saw to a 20-amp circuit in the house, and it works perfectly. This thing is rugged. And heavy!"
4,Reverse engineered,"This recording is an incredible blend of rock and electronica, and I count it as one of the best albums I have ever heard. My main problem with it. though, is that Lunatic Calm's order brings one down from a high, so to speak. Instead of leading off with the super high energy song, and then following up with the more mellow and trippy ones, they should have had a build up. Start with their slowest song, then lead up to mosh pit. It is for this reason alone that I award ""Metropol"" four stars. Unless you're amish, or a well-to-do, or someone who believes Haloween is a religous hoiday(In a bad way), this album is a must have in your collection."
1,Yet another Mexican DVD company putting out censored films. Will it ever end?!,DO NOT BUY ANY UNICINE DVDS. Every DVD they sell is a censored TV version of the film and therefore in my opinion they are pointless and completely worthless!Help stop the censorship and destruction of Mexican Cinema by NOT buying DVDs from companies how don't have a clue what they are doing. Someday I hope they will learn.
1,Sale with no-sufficient info,"The real kit of Gregg College Keyboarding contents: Text(1 book), manual(small book, around 200 pages-very necessary in class!) and a CD. At the College Bookstore, cost abot $110 (plus sale tax)What I bought by Amazon, for $75+shipping, was ONLY the text book. No CD, no manual.It wasn't clear on the ad that the ""kit"" is incomplete.If I should know this fact, before purchasing, I would never buy this product.I thought to send the whole box back, but I do not want to invest other$ 128 for the same purpose. Now, I use a copy/ scanned version of the manual in class, and I don't make homeworks at home ( without CD)Next time, I'll be more carefully when buying second-hand books."
2,Video Padded With Unknown Songs,"This is not the best of the Disney Sing-Alongs. ""Under The Sea"" is on it twice and it's further padded with song clips from the 40's like ""By The Beautiful Sea"" and ""The Sailor's Hornpipe"" which are faded and too old fashioned to engage the imagination of a present-day child (although they're kind of interesting to adults)."
5,Exactly what I expected,"I expected a brand new book, and got a brand new book! :) I would order from here again! The book is for class and I am glad I could find it at a cheaper price than the bookstore."
4,Straight Forward,"The book is precise and clear in its wording meaning and many examples. The examples are the reason this book is so large plus the fact that every effort is made to make the font large so that every note, symbol and chord is clear and exactly where it needs to be. Also each topic is developed in a one-at-a-time manner so that students of harmony need not think about more than one topic at a time - a valuable attribute of a complex subject such as harmony. The examples on motive, phrase, and sequence are well done. Particularly remarkable are the choices of composer and work that Seigmeister has used throughout. Coverage is from intervals up until Modulation. Modulation is the beginning subject in the second volume.Although this book has much to recommend it, I would not want to use it for a course since it doesn't have problems for the student to work. Nevertheless the book would make a great supplement to any course that covers Harmony in the common practice period."
4,Good Beach Music Album,"This is one of the many ""Beach Music"" CD's issued by Ripete Records. This one is unique in as much as it has some rare cuts like the full version of ""Workin' In A Coal Mine"" by Lee Dorsey with the sound effects at the beginning. It some out takes of ""Mother In Law"" with studio chatter by Ernie K-Doe. The Little Richard and Fats Domino cuts are live recordings and don't do the originals any justice. If you're looking for some rare R&B cuts...you'll find them on this compilation."
2,Not worth the money,"Sheets arrived with two top sheets and no bottom sheet. This was corrected by customer service with an e-mail. However, the sheets were all different shades of navy, none matching. Also snags in the fabric and fabric was very rough and cheap feeling. Toddler sheets are hard to find but these were definitely not worth the money."
2,Not up to par,"If you are expecting to see an Aziza-style performance of her working her special brand of majic with the veil, you will be disappointed. Presentation is a bit flat (not like her in real life at a workshop at all) and only basic moves are taught. Good for the beginner dancer."
5,Help the grandchild be a better cut-up,"He loves to cut things out, he's a lefty and needed proper tools. Everyone in the family will be happy now!"
3,This ONLY works in CERTAIN laptops,"I'm sure this thing works well but not in HP laptops. I don't even think it's a function of the card, I think it's HPs proprietary junk... I'll have to give it a 3 because I am not sure how well it really works, only on paper does it lookk good. This is supposed to work in all (IIRC) IBM thinkpads."
4,Great Jump Blues,"This poor boy from the South belted out some of the best soulful jump blues in the fifties on the famous jazz label Savoy. Known for his moderate hit ""Piddily Patter Patter"" made famous again in John Water's film 'Cry Baby,' this long overdue 2-CD compilation highlights some of his raucous rhythm & blues and soulful ballads. The birth of soul has a prelude to the often recognized Ray Charles... Nappy Brown is the man! Standout numbers to jive with your honey are ""Skiddy Woe"" and ""I'm Gonna Get You."" Do not overlook this real gone cat because he's up there with Wynonnie Harris and Roy Brown.by Victor C. for Grindstone Magazine"
3,Writen by youth for youth!,"This book, about experiential learning/activities, is written by youth for youth. If you work with youth groups, this is a nice addition to your leadership library. However, it is not a ""must buy."" If you have extra money to spend -- this is a book you may want to have."
5,Ancient Knowledge,"I've witnessed old Hopi farmers singing to their crops. I've been with Navajos, while deer hunting, and watched them sing to ravens...to ask them to show them where to hunt deer. I,ve talked to coiled rattle snakes, and seen them relax...and slither away. I'm surprised at the arrogance of humans, assuming..that intelligence is an exclusive domain. This book will, I hope, open closed minds to the life around them...and encourage dialogue...with other life forms."
1,Not worthwhile even at bargain basement price,"I agree with everything reviewer J. Martin said: two great writers but no effort showing here, 2 dimensional characters, lack of any development in plot or characters as the book continues. I found myself wincing throughout the book at bad dialogue, bad internal monologue, just ... bad writing, as though it was someone's senior high school project. My only addition is this: I bought the hardcopy from a bargain bin at my local store for $1.00. This should have been a warning, but I thought hey, maybe it was a print overrun. Please keep in mind I am a fan of both of these writers. But after reading E.Godz ... I wanted my dollar back. Yeah."
2,"Nice hero, weepy/whiny heroine","Gerard deserved better - he is blackmailed into marrying a spineless, weepy childlike woman who then betrays him, that was nice, and then it's only when she changes that she gets some spine. I like the tone of the book, but I don't like pushover heroines who are in constant need of handkerchiefs."
2,Extremely underdeveloped.....,"...is how I would describe this plot. There seems to be a lot to work with here---but the end falls so short of its possibilities.The action takes place in the span of a few days---making it difficult to believe the ""eternal"" love that manifests suddenly in the last chapter.There are far too many questions unanswered about these characters to develop any attachment to them--- and as a result the choices they make seem arbitrary and disjointed.There may be great potential in the series if the characters are ""fleshed out"" a bit---but I withold judgment until further reading in the series."
4,great caliper!!,"I am very happy with this caliper, but as other reviews has said it is NOT made is the USA. Also I feel that it would also be helpful for them to tell you in the description that it does indeed come with its own hard plastic case. I didn't know this and bought the nicer starrett case to keep it in, but I didn't really need it. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, a little more detail in the product description could have saved me $15 and given them an extra star. I would buy this item again, I use it for reloading."
1,this is not good,"Mest is quite possibly the worst band i've ever heard in my life( its close between Mest and SR71). They are the worst thing to ever come out of my hometown. since they're frome here all the good radio stations that are actually talking about them say how great they are but they must need mental help. Honestly almost any other cd would be better than this one. (note: i've never actually heard anything else other than whats the dillio?, but i can imagine its just as bad.) if i ever like this band, you all can start brutally killing me. and i was serious right there"
3,Bad Representation,"If I had heard the song ""What's the Dillio,"" on the radio before I had heard the rest of this album it never would have had a chance. Thankfully I didn't hear that lame attempt to incorperate an annoyingly overused phrase into a punk-pop song, because this is a pretty good album with that one exception. ""Drawing board"" is a great song, my favorite track on the album. Mest does betray their influences to a large degree (blink, Goldfinger) but those are good bands, so you can't fault them for it. If you like this album also try Fenix Tx, Mellincolin, and MxPx."
3,Unfortunately the album's title speaks for its self...,"This band is alright; better than a lot of the new ""punk"" bands that you see trying to make it big. If you like soft, slow pop-punk and girl songs you'll probably like this CD. But if you're a more punk-punk fan or a musician you'll probably be disapointed. I would recomend checking out bands like The Ataris, Goldfinger, Face to Face, and Millencolin - it's not the new and trendy pop-punk stuff you hear on the radio but it's still catchy and melodic. Dare you to look into it."
2,BIG TIME DISAPOINTMENT,"I can not understand the hype behind this book. I read a lot, I mean a lot. This was the first that I've read by Angela Hunt and probably the last. She took the first three hundred pages just to develop the theme. This ""page turning thriller"" then bogs down into a completely lame court room bore for the final 100 pages. It left me wondering if she has ever even been to court for a traffic ticket. The character development was fair at best and the plot was overly predictable - except for when it bordered on the unfeasible and ridiculous. I don't look to shoot holes through the books that I'm reading but this one is filled with them. There are dozens of Christian authors light years beyond her story telling capability. Unless you're already a fan of hers, save your time."
5,Interrupted Intermezzo Bartok,This piece of music is wonderful. it activates your brain into the world of imagnation. i like this CD because when i listen to it i feel like as if i'm i dunno.
2,Theologically Unsound,"Having read Joshua and enjoyed it, I snapped this up when I found it. Though the story was okay, I was disappointed in the book, overall. As others have stated, the writing was clumsy - a bit amateurish. The characterization of these inner-city residents was not believable. Still, wading through the less-than-stellar writing would have been worth it for the sake of a really good story. The bigger issue is that the theology presented in the book is atrociously unbiblical. The last thing we need is one more universalist, but that is just what we get in this story. Worse, we get a JESUS who is universalist. What a grievous misrepresentation of the King of kings and Lord of lords! Repeatedly, Joshua equates Yahweh and Allah, Islam and Christianity. Politically correct but Biblically INcorrect, this book is going in the garbage."
2,Great story...poor writing,"The Joshua series was suggested to me by a friend, so I bought the book. Joshua and the City is the only one I've read thus far and I must admit that I don't know if I'm willing to read any more. The premis of the book is fantastic...Christ on Earth...it could make a great story...however, the writing is terrible. The way these inner city kids talk is not very convincing, they talk with more proper English than I do...and I've found several editing mistakes throughout the book. Great story...very poor writing and editing."
5,Great read for parents and grandparents in particular,"Always a great read. Good Dog, Stay brought tears to my eyes. This collection of articles is very good. Parents and grandparents will love the comments about parenthood. Articles are short enough for a quick read from time to time."
3,The Wendigo,"This wasn't a bad little book. It just didn't jazz me like I'd hoped it would. I did like the ending, but getting there seemed a little long for such a short read."
2,cheap-looking typeset,"A wonderful tale, yet I purchased this hoping it included other Algernon stories as well. Be forwarned: this is only ""The Wendigo,"" and it is typeset as if for the sight-impaired. An esthetically awful choice to accompany the opening of each section with an enormous roman numeral and capital letter ruins the otherwise brilliant story. A modest, well thought ""intro"" to the nine sections would have made this bearable to look at. The publisher was obviously trying to fill up space."
4,Read It Before Spending a Night in the Woods,"Hunters head into woods. Hunters feel evil presence. Mythical creature snatches up hunter.It's a pretty basic plot as far as campfire horror tales go. But in the hands of a modern horror great, the psychology of the yarn morphs into something completely different. Sometimes it's in a good way, as with the terror that builds with each chapter. Other times, not so much, as with the climax that never quite takes off with the horrific jet fuel of the early parts.It's a classic, though, and is best read right before a trip into the great outdoors."
2,Did not hold my interest,"This is actually one of the few books that I have ever stopped reading. The story line was disjointed and confusing, and the story simply did not hold my interest. In fairness, however, I stopped reading at 30 pages, so it is possible that it did improve."
3,Very limited control selection,"I was flabbergasted to find out that the basic chart control does not ship with this edition. I need very simple graphs, and none of that functionality is available. no MSChart, or Microsoft graph in this version. Make sure you check the list of included controls... for the your needs before you buy this."
1,Do not buy this book.,"Horrible book!I didnt learn a thing from this book, the only thing this book does is show you are absolute basics, it doesnt go into any sort of detail at all.Is it worth buying? i dont think so."
5,Making Words activities Made Easy!,"This book gives you step-by-step instructions for ready-to-teach Making Words lessons!This terrific book has been around since December of 1998, and I had my copy on order for several months before it was published. I've used it extensively in my first grade classes, and loaned it to every teacher who was even remotely interested in having some pre-made Making Words lessons for their Working With Words block. This year I'm teaching a straight kindergarten class, and none of my kinderkids are quite ready for these formal lessons yet, but I expect that my top readers will be ready for these activities before Winter vacation. This is a must-have for your professional bookshelf."
2,Inspied?,"This book has some good points, but way too long and chases too many rabbits. it was long on examples. Too much love & touchy feely. Would have liked more facts & concrete information.It did provide some good ideas, but you had to shift through a lot of material to find them."
5,The best NOW yet,"The ""Now"" series has had its ups and down, even though it's only in its fourth installment. However, ""Now - Vol. 4"" features a solid collection of winners. From Backstreet Boys to Britney, and Sonique to blink-182, ""Now 4"" serves us a wonderful dish of pop/rock treats. Standout tracks include: ""It Feels So Good,"" the pandemic dance hit by Sonique, the seductive R&B sounds of Lenny Kravitz on ""I Belong to You"" (a song that should be played more by Top 40 radio, but isn't), underrated Aaliyah's ""Try Again,"" an efficacious hip-hop classic, and Macy Gray's ""I Try."" Now that's what I call music..."
4,The Songs,"Since this CD has the top 18 songs on the pop chart, these songs are great. I also have Now 2 and I like almost every song. The cd is great!"
5,Olivia does it again!!!,"This cd is beyond amazing!!! Olivia's voice is amazing on each and every one of these songs!! They are all fun and jazzy, if you are an Olivia fan or a fan of jazz I say go buy this cd!! It sure is a keeper!!!"
4,Ceasars,"After reading I Claudius, my interest wanted to learn more of early Roman history after the Claudian reign.This book provided what I was looking for and I enjoyed it immensley.Would recommend it to any person interested in early Rome as regards to the Ceasars."
3,A Place to Land by Dakota Moon,Enjoying this CD but not nearly as much as Dakota Moon by Dakota Moon. Their lyrics and harmonies remain second to none.
2,underwhelming,"Only vaguely reminiscent of the humor and zip of the original series.Almost everything outside of Rocky and Bullwinkle in this movie comes off poorly, and the squirrel and moose only have a few good lines themselves even. A clinker and poorly realized. Treasure the original cartoon series by Jay Ward. Long live Frostbite Falls!"
2,It tis better to let sleeping moose (or squirrel) lie!,"That may not be an actual proverb, but it sums up what was wrong with this production. While Jay Ward's classic (surprisingly one season only) show is remembered for its innovative blending of the political and the satirical in the guise of a cartoon, this film will simply be remembered as the one that Robert De Niro SHOULDN'T have made.Thankfully, June Foray, the original voice of both ""Rocky"" and ""Natasha"", is on hand. That is more a tribute to her talent than it is the worth of the film. Jason Alexander is No Paul Frees (""Boris"" in the series).Keith Scott is quite good as ""Bullwinkle"" (initially done by Bill Scott) but his turn as the ""narrator"" falls short. William Conrad (AKA radio's ""Matt Dillon"" and television's ""Cannon) provided the original's ""bite.""All in all, it may have looked good on paper..."
4,Ward hangs his head in shame,This movie is the adaptation of the 1960s TV show The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. It was a failed atempt though. This movie is slow and lacks that certian Ward cleverness. However this movie continues the traditional talking to the narrator and know it's a movie. However this movie would be a 3 if not for a fabulous animation scene in which Bullwinkle surfs the internet to get to New York in order to save Rocky and FBI agent Karen Sympathy. For those fimilair with the show may find this movie a disgrace like I. But those just getting into it or just buying this movie I'd recomend it too.
2,Clinton Schwartz' s review for Rocky and Bullwinkle,I don't this is even a good film because 30 minutes into the film I was bored to death I'd rather watch a Pokemon movie than this movie and why I trew the copy I recorded away forever.
3,So-so comedy,"Not great but very funny update of the classic television cartoon. The inane plot involves the evil trio of Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro), Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo), who have turned themselves from cartoon into live-action so that they can buy a television station and take over the world. Piper Perabo is somewhat feeble as the FBI agent sent to stop them with the help of that unstoppable duo Rocky and Bullwinkle (here rendered with impressive computer animation. Russo is a gas as the gorgeous femme fatale (so gorgeous in fact that while near her Alexander completely vanishes off the screen), while DeNiro is embarrassingly over the top as in his role. The film has some very hilarious jokes in it, mostly involving the titular heroes, plus a boatload of famous names doing cameos (Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, John Goodman), but the film doesn't maintain its hectic hilarity throughout."
1,ONE OF THE WORST EVER MADE,This would have to be one of the worst films ever made in Hollywood history. All the actors must have been hard up for money to even think about reading the bad script. Thumbs down to this garbage. I could only watch about 20 minutes of this film and took it straight back to my video dealer and got my money back.....Don't even think about hiring or buying this one!!!
5,Fuel Filter Replacement,"Perfect fit! Just like the AC Delco. Easy to install, no special tools required. Filters the gas as expected, no problem."
2,cheesy,for the price of this you cant expect much . There are not to my knowledge any good pinball games for the computer at amazon although at brothersoft.com you may find The Tomb an 10 dollar game that looks well worth the money.
3,Short fantady adventure novel from the king of saga.,"Best known as the creator of historical based family sagas, Jakes takes a break from those huge novels to create a short novel of swashbuckling adventure."
4,Not Bad,"Like one of the other reviewers wrote, this one starts fast and hard, and then quickly whimpers away. I believe the problem may be that David Ball didn't have a huge selection of hits to choose from!! Ball appeared largest right around the time that Clint Black gave up traditional country to pursue a more pop-influenced sound. David Ball grabbed the country music world by the 'nads with his ""Thinkin Problem"" and ""Watching My Baby..."", but shortly thereafter, all of his songs sounded pretty much the same and he disappeared from the charts. I'm not sure what happened, but it was apparent that he was competing with the other ""Hat-acts"" of the early-'90's. Still, a very good album, well mixed and produced, and contains all of his biggest hits (and a few that I've never heard of)."
2,There are 2 kinds of trash my mother always said...,good trash and trashy trash. This is unfortunately the latter. The plot is okay. The dialogue is terrible. And it may be the worst read book on tape I have ever heard. Why authors read their own books instead of hiring a pro is a mystery to me.
3,Underrated soul singer...incomplete collection of songs,"Hard core fans should definitely get the 'Music in my Bones' or 'The Spring Years' collections. But this is a good sampler of Joe Simon's straight-from-the-country, pleading, country-tinged vocal approach. Fave tunes are Teenagers Prayer, Chokin' Kind, and Farther on Down the Road. Joe was in the nasally Al Green/Johnnie Taylor line of church-weaned soul singers; only his voice was deep and mellow, with a more deliberate delivery. Back porch with a glass of ice tea, if you will. He would have made an excellent country music singer if that genre had been more receptive to Black singers back then. Some are critical of the organic, sometimes primitive nature of this sub-genre of soul. But that does make Simon's work any less significant than say, the stripped-down recordings of Delta bluesmen such as Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker."
3,"Warning, only the last 1/3 is good","For some reason, the later Pern books have very little about dragons (or their kin) in them. They go on and on and ON about the people and their relationships. You can read any book about people. You can only read about dragons and the fabulous dragon/human bond in Pern books. (I've tried others, but no other world is as compelling). It's too bad there is so little of it lately. Finally, at the end of the book, the story picks up considerably. It took me months to read the first two thirds, because I constantly set it down. The last third went by in a flash, and was over way too soon. I see a new Pern novel is coming out. I sure hope it isn't another book on dragons with no dragons in it..."
2,Uninspired,"I always have high hopes for a new Pern book. This one did not fulfill at all.In a way, it reminds me of the early Harper books. Unfortunately, this one is severely limited in scope, uninspired, has a bad plot, and is not satisfying."
4,Dragon's Kin,I really enjoyed this book. It was fascinating to read more about Watchweres and their origins. The characters I found were interesting and vivid if slightly under-drawn. I recommend this book to fans.
3,"Great Start, Fizzles in the end.",This book had a great start. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you interested. That is up until about the last three chapters. It seemed like the McCaffreys got tired of writing and lost interest in the story line. Kindan was made out to be a main character but in the end was shoved aside like he was nothing. The book set itself up for a sequel but why read a sequel that has the potential to let you down the way this book did. It was very disappointing.
1,Don't even bother.,"I was disappointed to discover that I can't give zero stars for a review - this book doesn't even deserve one.I was fond of the Pern books when I was younger, so I read this one because of that remembered fondness, and because I was curious to see how Todd McCaffrey would handle the world of Pern. I'm afraid to say that the answer is, not very well. To be blunt, I found the writing amateurish, the characters shallow and uninteresting, the songs sounding like the efforts of an uninspired junior-high student, and the ""science"" beyond horrible.If you like Pern, don't read this book. It'll only disappoint you."
4,Very good lather,"I have to say, Taylor of Old Bond Street makes a good shaving cream. I put very little on my brush, rub it on my face and then go back and re-wet the brush and then rub some more. The cream lathers up incredibly thick. My skin is fairly sensitive and this cream protects my face like none other that I have tried. The lavendar smell is not overly strong and could be a little richer. Other than that, the increase in quality over a grocery store cream or gel is worth in the increase in price."
2,Beware the thorns,"I adore TOBS products, I really believe they are of great quality and value. This particular shave cream delivers on the slick cushioning that users have come to expect. I cannot fault it on that aspect... however, the scent, the scent is dreadful. Sorry to say that I couldn't wait to wash this off and be rid of it forever.The aroma is of ""fake"" rose and has to my senses, a chemical smell that I simply couldn't abide. It did give me a great and comfortable shave, but it seemed I was enveloped in a cloud of sickly awfulness that wouldn't go away easily.A great product, but this one is not for me.Cheers"
2,Not Good If You Have Dry Skin,"I bought this following all the rave reviews. I may have been expecting too much but this stuff definitely dries your skin out far more than regular cans of shaving cream. The lather stuff is nice but if it doesn't leave your skin soft, then it is kind of pointless. I bought this stuff last fall and used it for a bit, but as winter came I had to switch back to a can of cream which surprisingly worked really well with the safety razor. Also the Rose fragrance is not as overpowering as you think. I was personally hoping it would give off more smell, but it is really suttle and does not stick with you throughout the day unfortunately."
1,DO NOT TRUST COMPANY,"This company had this product listed. I ordered. They canceled with NO explanation. Several days, maybe a week, later I noticed the item was still listed and for the exact same price. I ordered again. Again, they canceled with no explanation. I could understand if they had, by mistake, listed the price wrong the first time. But, when a week later it was still listed the same way, they should have to honor it. This company is totally unreliable.I can not believe Amazon allows this to continue."
2,Smell Great but don't work!,"I purchased the basil scent at my local grocery store. This products smells great, but they do not work AT ALL for helping with static cling. I am extremely disappointed! If you are looking for something to help with static cling in your laundry, this is NOT the product for you."
2,If only Gwen Stefani was Courtney Love...,"I'm sorry but Bush, this was obviously a corporate scheme. I don't necessarily have a problem with it, it's pretty good music, but it's TOO blatant. I mean the whole look, sound, riffs were just too much. Gavin Rossdale has for sure lost the touch, although he only had a mediocre one to begin with.I guess you could get this album, the songs are pretty normal ""alternative"" 'hits'."
1,Gibberish,"I bought this album and Sponge ""Rotting Pinata"" at the same time. I listened to both, threw Sixteen Stone aside and nearly wore out Pinata...two weeks later it seems like, everybody and they're dog is playing or listening to ""everything zen"" and praising Bush for their ""new"" take on grunge music. I was shocked. The lyrics to ""everything zen"" are ""try to see it once my way-ay-ay....everything zen, everything zen, I don't think so...zen...zen...zen...I DON'T THINK SO!""...I actually think a generation of American's are now dumber for having listened to this album. It's like Gavin Rossdale cut random words out of a dictionary, pasted them together in no particular order...went out drinking and smoking for 3 days straight and then came back and sang/yelled 15 sentences of moronic drivel in as gravelly a voice as he could muster while his band played Nirvana backwards. Which made him just famous enough to land Gwen Steffani......Daft Prick."
1,"No, They Don't Sound Like Nirvana...","...because Nirvana' Kurt Cobain knew how to tap into emotions, and create complex, interesting arrangements. On the other hand, Mr. Rossdale and his band simply pound their guitars loudly -- and badly. Furthermore, Nirvana's lyrics, whether they touch you or not, come from raw emotion. Rossdale's shallow slimy lyrics make me want to vomit. I think he's been picking words randomly out of a hat and making songs out of them. Bush is the absolute lowest common denominator kind of slop that appeals to people, though. They sure as hell try to sound like Nirvava, but fail miserable."
5,An Awesome CD,"This is one of my all time favorite albums. It is Bush at their best. There is never a dull moment on this CD. At the time of sixteen stone's release, this CD was a welcome change in my collection. It is an essential album for any music lover."
4,Oustanding guitar sounds.,"Nothing quite hits you like Bush's guitars sound and their crazy slideing solos.While this album sounds a bit thrown together, it does contain some brilliant tracks such as ""Everything Zen"" ""Little Things"" and ""Come down"" AND ""Bomb.""The rest are little undeveloped, but ""Alien"" has is'nt half bad either, although the chorus is what stands out.As for ""Glycerine"" well, tlak about overatedness!!!"
4,Great CD from a good band,"Great CD! Everything Zen, Comedown, Machinehead, and Glycerine are all great songs.."
2,A bit too dark for me.,"I really didn't like this movie. It was just too dark for me. But, if you like a good murder mystery, you may enjoy it."
4,Great product,"I purchased this to help level a permanent wood foundation wall system. It allowed me to quickly and accurately place foundation wall sections without needing a level. The last wall piece joined up perfectly to the first piece I laid.When using this outdoors in bright, direct sunlight, it only has an effective range of about 10 or possibly 15 feet with a lot of squinting. On overcast days or when using it in shadows I was able to pick out the line from 25-30 feet away. At night or when using this indoors, there is no difficulty in picking up the line at any (reasonable) distance."
5,covenants got it!,"another hot cd from the veteran rockers ufo. great hard rock from the opener ""love is forever"" to the slightly softer but catchy ""seranade"". hope this ufo line up keeps the cds coming. schenker/mogg/way/dunbar are a great team. tour any time? we hope. a must cd for any ufo fan"
2,Two stars - and I'm being kind...,"After my first listen, one word came to mind: dreck! As a longtime UFO/MSG fan, it amazes me that UFO are becoming a parody of themselves! I also can't believe Michael Schenker would put his name on all but two of these mostly throwaway songs. Production values - I've heard better demos for bands just starting out. And, that ""bonus"" CD - it would nice if the songs were listed in the correct order on the booklet. Someone said ""Show me the money"" and out popped this CD. I hope they make enough money so Mogg/Way can retire and not have the urge to bless us with another slab like this."
2,Web-TV Upgrades,"If Magnovox sells web-tvs, they should stand behind their product and offer upgrades as the computer world does. Ijust gave my daughter and her family one of their web-tvs, not knowing that they would not be able to gain access to all the internet and games. The one I gave her has a place for a ""smart card"" (what is that...I can't find out) and a port for ""futureadditional parts"", whatever that means. IF there was a way to use a printer, and hook up a cd-rom drive, it would be wonderful...my grandkids couldn't crash it! So why don't you get off your duff, Magnovox, and fix the thing?!! And ohhhh Microsoft, you knew what was going on, why didn't you do the right thing by your subscribers when you bought this stuff out? Either offer them a VERY REASONABLE TRADE-IN, in exchange for an updated model that will use IE 5 and 6, or Netscape at the latest level??? Better Business is only better if it WORKS, guys."
4,Good Basic Tools,"You get what you pay for, and for $8, you get a really decent set of drivers for basic use. I bought this set to replace a smaller version of these that had 2 phillips head drivers and 4 flatheads. This set fills out each a bit more and adds some hex drivers as well, which I don't exactly need, but may come in handy later.One tip is that if you're trying to get a screw and its in really tight, use a pair of pliers on the serrated part of the driver and press down on the driver and then turn with the pliers and usually gets even the tightest screws, even with these cheaper screwdrivers."
5,"Shirley Temple - America's Sweetheart Collection, Vol. 3","The best! Includes the extraordinary genius of Bill ""Bogangles"" Robinson in ""Colonel & Rebel."" These are the only two movies where he appeared with Temple. It doesn't get any better. Be still my heart!"
3,An overview of why kanji (and chinese characters) are so difficult to remember,Good book with some helpful information. It helps if you have an understanding of Japanese sounds and basics before looking at this.
5,Mmmm Hepcat,"Hepcat is my favorite band, hands down. I have seen them live at least half a dozen times, and I have been a faithful listener since I discovered a track of theirs on California ska-quake back in the early 90s. I rushed out and bought Out of Nowhere, and that was it.But about this album. It's mellow, rude boy. So pour youself a glass of bourbon, set the lawn chair out on the fire escape, and turn the voulme way up."
1,Different in picture!!,"I received the product and suprised to know that the actual product is different in picture - it is in nylon. Amazon, you are deceitful."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"I saw this book online and thought it would be great because of the author. Since this is my first time being pregnant, it was kinda cute to read the little tidbits in each section, but the first reviewer was right. No brilliant, funny, or even little know jewels are shared in this book. I paid a total of about $3 for this book with the shipping, and that's all it's worth. It would make an ok gift for a first time mom, but please don't pay full price!"
2,Narrative Disjointed,"I do not share the same high ratings expressed by other reviewers. The idea of getting the German side of the story is quite compelling and does shed some light on what happens within their ranks as this event unfolds. However, unless you are already very familiar with the details of this battle before reading this book, it is rather difficult to follow the author's presentation.As mentioned by others, the author is not a writer, but a former soldier. As such, his descriptions might appeal more to those who are interested in tactical details and not so much an easy to follow/well written prose. To those who plan to read this book, a primer on this conflict is first highly recommended. As always, A Bridge Too Far is a good starting place, but there are others that cover the Allied side as well. Also, a decent and detailed map of the area where the engagement took place is essential."
1,Could have been better,"Personally I thought that this game could have been a lot better. The only thing that I thought was cool was the videos. You can't even tell the guys to move. Plus the video that they show at the begining of the game is just a tinny little square, most of the time it just gets messed up. If I were you I would get Sid Meier's Civil War Collection."
1,disappointed,"I was excited to have something for our little bathroom. However, as I began to put it together, I noticed how cheaply made this item was. It's a great concept, but it's another one of those ""you get what you pay for"" items. It broke at a solder point as I tried to put it together. And, it wouldn't line up properly because it was so distorted...right out of the box. Now, I continue to search for the perfect thing. So disappointed."
1,Lawyers should save their advice for their clients.,"The saddest part of this sorry book is the fact that it pretends to be written by an experienced trial lawyer. Ms. Wiehl has less experience at trying cases than most first year district attorneys. Wiehl has an amazing ability to sell herself. The problem is that there is very little to be gotten from such shallow waters. Worse still is the utter irrelevancy of so-called ""lawyer lessons"" given that lawyers suffer inordinately high divorce rates, alcoholism, depression and other stress-related illnesses. The best advice may well be that lawyers should tend to their garden and leave the rest of us to learn our own lessons. Now that is a winning strategy!"
4,Sister Who?!,"For a grade B film, it's pretty good! This film starts off very amateurish, but uses this as an effect to transition to the main story. I almost gave up on it in the 1st few minutes, but was glad I watched all of it. There are multiple stories by the end, and the screenwriting was done well enough to keep it interesting, funny, and not all predictable. It's clean, has some humor, romance, and ends with a feel good happy ending. It's refreshing to see enjoyable entertainment that does not have to have bad language, violence, or sex to carry the story. Despite being very clean I would rate it PG only because younger children may not understand it."
3,Great video but could you somehow adjust the audio?,"Any Thin Lizzy fan has had a copy of this show for years as a bootleg or legitimate VHS release. The problem with this dvd is there are no extras and the sound quality is that of a transistor radio. The picture quality is terrific and probably the best official release of Phil Lynott and the boys visually. ""Live & Dangerous"" if you can find is also worth the money with better sound. This show definitely captures the energy of Lizzy live, it is just such a shame that the sound is so bad. I would have given this a much higher rating if they could fix the sound, is Australian TV that bad in sound quality?"
3,Rock & roll needs more volume!,"I love Gary Moore and was excited to be able to get this. And of course, he doesn't disappoint. But the volume is so low on the dvd it's hard to get into the feeling of the music. I hope you have a sound system that can help the problem. It's worth it to see them all as young and so great, though. Just wish I could turn it up ....."
2,Skip this if you are not a diehard Thin Lizzy fan.,"The audio is terrible on this, and the volume is not consistant. The cameras are panning the crowd or off somewhere durring some guitar solos. Gary Moore is great, but Brian Downey is missing on drums. The Thin Lizzy sound that took them to the top was Lynott, Gorham, Robertson and Downey (the video cover says original members, but that is false). I can't believe Rhino did not re-engineer the sound on this. The video ""Live and Dangerous"" (out of print) blows this video away."
3,"sincere tribute to a great artist, but a little too mimetic","I definately enjoy this album, and it's exciting to hear other musicians paying tribute to an artist I thoroughly enjoy and respect. Some of the songs (pieces of me is definately one of the better ones) differ from Ashlee's album enough to shine through in their own right, while others aim too close to the mark and inevitably (as there is only one Ashlee) fall short. But that's not to say you can't enjoy all of the songs, I mean, the originals are so good anyone trying to imitate them is destined to remain in their shadow, but it's still a pretty awesome shadow."
3,Lyrical Genius,"First let's state the obvious: This dude can rhyme. I don't mean Green Eggs and Ham rhyme, but serious flows that are flavored with an esoteric spice only discernible to the true fan of the form. Big L is on an elite list of highly developed lyricists. When I listen to his licks I'm mesmerized. Where music fails, he supports it with so much inventive style that I have to rewind and listen again. This is an album for people who love rhyme. The music is good, but it fails in comparison to the weaving of words and rhythm that keep coming from every track."
4,"Dope, Dope , Dope","No doubt Big L was one of the greatest MC's of his time, he wasn't that average cat, he got punch lines, verbal skils and a unique style of rapping. I like this album, altough 2 versions of ""The Heist"" is unecessary, but this CD shows a hungry rapper spittin'fire verse after verse."
5,Review of The Big Picture (Big L),The Big L tracks on this cd are absolutly fantastic I would encourage any rap fan to purchase this CD!!!!!!!
5,R.I.P !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will miss u fo eva Big L !,"Best rapper by his lyrics and flow, just sick, sometimes his flow is so quick and sickly good u just don't get it. The intro on this album is surprisingly good, beat by Dj Premier (Gang Starr's producer).Here is some of his sick lyrics from the song Holdin' It Down. (Also check out his lyrics in the intro that is sick to).The other night around 8 P.M.Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the gray BMWent to the ATM, took a thou' outthen later on I had to wild outIn the club, knock some coward and his pal outThen afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal outNow I'm thinkin - which chick number I could dial out"
2,major disappointment!,"This series got off to a wonderful start with Jeff Rovin's Return of the Wolfman, but this belated follow up pales in comparison. The sense of fun in the first book is completely lacking, and the monsters barely appear! PLEASE: get Rovin to write any further sequels! This one is very dull. If they are trying to kill off what could have been a great series, this just might do it. Even the cover art is lame! Definately not recommended; even for fans. If you haven't read the first book, do so, but this is mostly a waste of time and money."
4,"""Farewell"", ""Ruska"", and ""Bittersweet"" are excellent songs","A good number of the songs on this album are a touch ""heavy metal"" but there are enough songs that I really like to make this a good album. There is a bonus track with Eicca singing in German. I could be wrong, but she doesn't sing in English on this album. Maybe she doesn't feel comfortable singing in the English, but the two gentlemen on the album do a good job on the tracks with lyrics. ""Farewell"" is an emotional piece that I quite enjoyed."
1,replacement doesn't work either,"Not only did neither of these heat up, but neither one of them vibrated for more than a couple of seconds. Even if it did work, it's too big and cumbersome. Lots of hype for an inferior product."
2,Not impressed,"Forget about being discrete with this thing. I opened the box and it was over a foot tall! This thing is HUGE, and definitely gets in the way of intimacy. It's also super noisy as is not nearly as powerful as it sounds. Ilike the idea of it being rechargeable, but that's about all the credit I give it. Nice try, Oprah."
3,Aphrodite.,Not as good as I expected. You have to charge it to use it. Can't plug up while you use but charge it then use. Expected more.
4,Camp Chef outdoor cooker,"It's the best outdoor cooker, but I can't find another one so had to order the bayou that was returned later on."
3,Good but Overrated,"Friend is a showing of 4 childhood friends as they grow into adults. The movie deals with honor, loyalty, and the question of what it truly means to being a friend. I had a couple of problems with this flick. I liked how the movie starts out but then it drags a bit in the middle. The acting in certain scenes is bad and had a bit too much of male sentimental melodrama for my liking. There are no guns in the movie which had me scratching my head (not that I need guns in a movie to enjoy it but they are gangsters after all). But the thing that really bothered me, although purely cosmetic, was the gangster friend Dong-su. He turns into a complete ripoff of Tony Montana. When I saw him in that outfit and posturing the way he was I was laughing and shaking my head at the same time. If you wanna see a Korean flick I'd go for Oldboy, Tae Guk Gi, or Attack the Gas Station.3.5 stars"
5,Good controllers for a great price.,"These controllers are a good value for the money. I needed two controllers and found these. Both of them were less than one XBox controller and so far, no problems!"
4,"Rough around the edges, but still quite enjoyable","It's true that this episode from Season 1 of MST3K is rough around the edges, but that doesn't mean that it's not enjoyable. The biggest flaws are long silences, some unfunny riffs (""Sure, next you'll tell me there's a ring around Uranus!""), and a couple awkward host segments (especially the intro). However, the novelty of seeing a first season episode is enough to make this episode worth purchasing, and it's actually quite entertaining. There are some really memorable riffs in this episode (""It's the Crawling Bladder!""), and at times they keep coming steadily, like in later seasons. The episode does get off to a shaky start (the intro segment is sloppy, and most of the bad riffing seems to be concentrated within the first 30 minutes), but thankfully gets much better as it goes on. I wouldn't recommend this to someone new to MST3K (get Manos: the Hands of Fate and I Accuse My Parents first), but it's a real treat for MSTies."
5,Cass Elliot fan,"I loved Pufnstuf as a child. I saw this movie in the theater. When I realized that Mama Cass was in it, it was my life-long ambition to get this movie! I tried unsuccessfully to convince Blockbuster video that this movie existed! Finally, when I visited [the web] I thought I'd try to see if it was here. You can't imagine my amazement! The movie is a MUST SEE for children (or big kids like me!). No bad language, and very colorful...great songs.... My 5-year old sings along with it!Sid and Marty Krofft did us a favor and satisfied the child in all of us with this one."
4,Even kids nowadays can get into this movie!,"I remember watching Pufnstuf along with the rest of Sid and Marty Kroffts productions growing up. They were great. My brother-in-law made us a copy of some of the shows back when Nickolodean was running a Sid and Marty Krofft marathon. My three and five year olds girls were hooked. They are now five and seven and still enjoy. It is something to watch as a family. And while it might not be as graphically well-done as newer shows and video games, it still has a bit of fascination to it no matter what age you are."
5,Picked it up and couldn't put it down...,"The Immortal Game is a great detective/mystery novel in the vein of Chandler and Hammett. I really enjoyed the characters and all their ""quirks"" and am looking forward to the continuing escapades of August Riordan. I'm a reader of ALL mystery novels, from P.D. James (who I imagine is NOT one of Mr. Coggins favorite authors!) to Dashiell Hammet and this one is a definite winner. I would highly recommend this book to my best friends!"
4,"May help you catch fish, but it it may not.........","This book has a lot of good info. However, It has very few illustrations or photographs and the ones it does have are low quality. I don't think Kevin is giving any secrets away in this book. There is a lot of contradictory information. The end message is to try everything and do whatever works."
4,Looks great. A bit small if expecting to be flashy,"I bought this as an averyday pendant for my girlfriend and its perfect. not to big so that it looks like bling but just good enough for it to get noticed and praised. It's a great little gift and the chain does not look cheap. it came in a nice jewelry box and very protected packaging. NOTE: SHIPPING TO CANADA WAS 35$ PLUS FEDEX CHARGED ME !0,49$ EXTRA! Apart from that, its a good deal."
2,Don't buy without browsing the contents first,"I was surprised to see good reviews of this book. There seems to be an audience that finds this book useful, but it's not clear to me why.This book lacks any analysis or useful conceptual insight. The author also seems to have spent little or no effort in attempting to organise the material. It's simply a bottom-up, blow-by-blow account of walking through the steps of developing trivial applications using the Apache and GLUE SOAP servers. Most people would be far better off reading the documentation for the SOAP platfrom they want to use.From my point of view, this book borders on fraud. It's clear from this book that Oreilly have really dropped their game."
1,Letter to Sams Publishing,"This is to inform you that I will never buy another book from Sams! You really should be ashamed of yourselves for releasing such a poorly edited piece of garbage with your name attached. This is particularly unfortunate because the authors have presented a fairly comprehensive review of the capabilities of Flash Mx and Flash Actionscripting. However, because of the outrageous number of errors, both in the book and on the accompanying web site, it it difficult to follow and complete far too many of the exercises. I wish I had a dollar for every hour I have wasted because of this book - going down blind alleys, barking up the wrong tree, chasing ghosts, etc. Lord, how frustrating!Thank you,A former customer"
1,Steamy piece of ... pie! Put a minus in front of that star,There must not have been a proofreader available in all of the land when they put this hunk of confusing junk together. Top it off with a barely useable companion website and you have one of the lamest excuses for a learning tool I have seen. You may as well just try to learn Flash MX by hitting your keyboard with a baseball bat and except the resulting output with a big stupid smile on your face. Take a match to the money you would spend on this book. You will get more out of it.
4,A nice non-irritating product,I tend to have really sensitive skin and it seems that most products end up giving me a reddish complexion or brings out certain irritations. I find with Arbonne it's a pretty safe bet and leaves my skin smooth. It's often expensive but I haven't yet found a product that is better that doesn't bother my skin. And the extra steps really don't take that long at all! Best to buy on amazon since you get a better deal. Hope that helps!
1,i am still waiting,i havent got any idea for this product because dont arrive to me...i am still waiting may be arrive to me in few months:((
3,high priced,"High price for a hunk of plastic, but I needed them for my server. Easy to use, just expensive."
3,Short annonation of Lyle Dorsett's biography on Billy Sunday,"A critical treatment of Sunday`s life, as part of the Library of Religious Biography series. Separates Sunday`s evangelistic career into four sections: beginnings, rise, prominence, and decline. One chapter is devoted exclusively to Sunday`s legacy. Includes the sermons ""Heaven,"" and ""Get on the Water Wagon."""
2,So~so,It is a requirement for a class. I find some of the material outdated. I have yet to finish the book.
1,Junk.. broke after 2 months,Usually Cusinart is a pretty safe bet.. but this grinder is garbage. The power button started to act up after a month ( you had to press it just right to work ) and now after 2 months it wont start.
2,Doesn't last,"This grinder doesn't last. We replaced one on warranty and have had the second one fail, all within a few years. What's the point of a brand name like Cuisineart if the warranty is only 18 months?"
2,Broke after less than a year,"This grinder seemed great for a while, but it broke after less than a year of normal use. It would turn on, but would just whir, without spitting out the correct amount of ground coffee. Read on the internet that it sometimes gets 'clogged' with powdery grinds, and that you should open it up to clean. Seems silly, but I gave it a try. After taking it apart and putting back together, no change. Seems like anything for this price should last at least a year."
5,Excellent Value,"We had purchased this product 8 years ago from Chef's magazine and the old one finally wore out after 2,500 uses. We loved it so much we wanted to replace it with the same brand. GOOD NEWS is that we paid half as much as we did 8 years ago so we bought two. Delivery and all other purchase details were flawless."
1,I really wish this was a better grinder,"Actually, the grinder is fine. I love the fact that I can set the number of cups to have the coffee ground for and just walk away. It's awesome.Unfortunately, that feature quit working before 12 months was up. The grinder itself quit about a year later.I am now shopping again and I would love to have another one of these, but not until they do something about their quality."
2,LOUD!,"Weve had this unit for three months and I cant wait for it to break. My wife actually has to grind the beans the night before because using the grinder in the morning will wake up the entire family. The unit itself works great, but the volume is completley unacceptable."
2,Great looks but....,"I thought I was purchasing a top quality product, but was very disappointed. First, for its size, the grinder is loud. Second, the slider switch for the amount of grounds is flimsy, and the off/on switch is too easy to press when you don't want to activate the grinder. Finally, after one month, regardless of the setting, the unit would only run for a couple of seconds with an activation. I returned the unit and received a replacement, which I haven't used yet."
3,"good value, but grind is not uniform","We've used this grinder every morning for the past two years. For all that use, it seems to be holding up well - no concerns about durability.Like previous reviewers, the plastic parts are a bit of a disappointment. Coffee, especially dark roasts, tends to stick to the sides. Of greater concern is the uniformity of the grind. Although the bulk of the grounds are nice and uniform, and can be adjusted based on your preference, we always seem to end up with a ""chunk"" of VERY fine grounds at the top of the grinder. We try to pick this out, since it can wreck the taste of the coffee.Despite these concerns, it's a decent grinder for the money."
1,Broke after one year,"This grinder worked wonderfully for the first year. Thereafter, a screw came loose that secures the grinding component. This in turn cracked the base of the coffee bean container rendering the grinder useless. Because Cuisinart no longer makes parts for this model, it cannot be fixed. This is not the first bad experience I have had with Cuisinart products. The next time a make a purchase in the small appliance category I will surely avoid Cuisinart."
1,Lousy product,"We received this as a gift about 7 mos ago. Seemed to work ok...not spectacular. Didn't notice a difference in coffee taste compared to the cheaper grinders GE, Braun & Mr. Coffee make. About 2 wks ago...after only using it a couple times a week since we owned it...the machine completely died...motor gave up and although my husband opened the bottom hoping it might just be a loose wire...no such luck. I would greatly discourage purchasing this ..just because I'm not the only reviewer who had the machine die on them. Cuisinart makes a great coffee maker...we love ours...and wouldn't trade it for anything...but they need some new engineers working on their burr grinders...cause the current people assigned to the design of this machine...haven't got it right!"
2,Plastic inside simply disintegrated,"It never did grind coarse enough for my French press, but I liked that it came apart easily for cleaning. Problem was very very low quality plastic on the inside that came off a piece at a time until it just simply disintegrated. Lasted less than a year."
1,Lasted 3 months,"I thought this was going to be a good grinder, butit failed to work after only three months. I replacedit with a cheap blade grinder; one with no circuitry...you put in the amount you want, and hold a hard-wiredbutton until it is done. Sometimes cheap and simple isjust the way to go. This grinder is a waste of good money."
5,Lasting years,I have had this grinder for years with no problems at all. I grind a ton of coffee and am surprised that it's still grinding away. I will gladly buy again. It is a bit loud but I'm not sure how you could make a quiet coffee grinder. Holds more than half a pound of beans.
2,Totally useless for espresso grind,"I purchased this thinking I can use it for drip, french press as well as espresso.I was wrong.It's partly true that you can use this for espresso. You have to grind then sift, and eventually you'll end up with espresso grind.I believe it is almost fraudulent to claim that this product can produce espresso grind. Going from the coarsest setting to the finest setting, there is very little difference in the consistency of the grind produced. On the finest setting, which you'd normally expect to be espresso grind or the powder-fine grind used for Turkish coffee, about 20% of the grounds come out fine enough.I'm reminded of an old Yiddish joke about a man who gets a badly-fitted suit from his tailor... You can make it work but it's not worth the trouble.Otherwise it's a nice product as I'd expect from Cuisinart, it's just NOT at all designed to produce espresso grind. Spend another $30 and get the Capresso Infinity if you want espresso grind."
1,this grinder fell apart within a year,"My wife and I got one of these for Christmas. I've been disappointed with this and other Cuisinart equipment. The upper burr (grinding plate) is attached with screws to not very sturdy piece of brittle plastic of the hopper tube which broke into 20 pieces with less than a year of less than once per day use. The only fix is a new bean chamber, and that doesn't fix the burrs that are no longer sharp from grinding the plastic into our coffee. The result is too much fine coffee powder mixed with the ground coffee. I hope I just got a defective unit. I'm looking at the bunn or the kitchen-aid to replace it."
2,Not for espresso...,"The dbm-8 has decent reviews for grinding for drip coffee, but I was unable to get a usable espresso grind out of it and so had to return it. As much as you may want to get away with buying an espresso grinder for cheap (ie, less than a couple hundred bucks), it really isn't possible."
2,"Grinds well, but has issues","This grinder lasted under a year for me. The grind was good, but I always got many fines along with the size I desired."
4,A good coffee bean grinder,1. Looks good2. Holds a half pound of beans.3. Stays on until the correct amount of coffee is ground without having to hold down any buttons and then shuts off.4. Can be preset from fine to coarse grind.5. I have not used it long enough to find out if it will clog up as many burr grinders do as I did not see any instructions by the manufacturer as to open and clean it or even if that is necessary.
2,Earplugs Required,"This unit functions okay but talk about noisy. It sounds like it has a Briggs & Stratten engine in it, like a lawnmower turning on. You need earplugs for it. I don't know how these things get on the market that are noisy enough to damage your hearing."
1,"Fine functionality, terrible quality.","I am on my second Cusinart DBM-8. The first one lasted a little over a year, then just stopped working. The cost of fixing it was more than the cost of a new one, so I purchased another. This morning, when I got up to make some coffee, I find that this new one is now not working. I have had it for about 9 months. So, two DBM-8's, average life, 11 months.It used to be that appliances lasted forever, that is no longer the case. Cuisinart also used to be a name associated with high quality products, that is also no longer true. I would recommend NOT purchasing this product."
2,"Great Grinder, while it works","We bought this burr grinder about a year ago as a Christmas present for my dad. It worked great for about 4 months and then it broke. Support wasn't helpful at all, and we couldn't figure out a way to get it fixed. Honestly we were just really disappointed with Cuisinart on this one. Go with a different brand like we did, you won't regret it!"
1,Nice grinder/lasts less than a year,"I purchased this grinder through amazon.com and got less than 3 months use out of it before it broke. Cuisinart replaced it I am sure with a remanufactured model and it also broke, this time a small plastic cap spun off inside the grinder. Do not purchase this model.David Miller"
2,Not for espresso,"There are 300+ other reviews you can read here, so I won't go into too much detail-But I am disappointed because the whole reason I bought this grinder is to grind coffee for espresso- and this CAN NOT DO THAT.Even on the finest setting, it is too coarse.This is a bummer, especially since cuisinart touts it as being able to do just that.For just grinding regular beans- it's great.But it can't do espresso, which makes it pretty useless to me."
2,Very Poor Product,"I bought this largely on the strength of the brand name. The ability to grind large batches of coffee and multiple grinds were key features. Unfortunately, this product failed in so many ways.First, it doesn't grind coffee fine enough for espresso. Set on it's finest setting, it grinds about right for a French press.Second, the grind is very inconsistent.Third, it is difficult to get coffee out of the container without making a real mess. The amount of cleanup required after using this device is extraordinary.Fourth, the motor failed after just a few months and only modest usage. One morning I was grinding coffee and I detected an electrical fire smell and the motor just burned out.Do not waste your money on this product."
4,grind that coffee!!,"I like the coffee grinder, it grinds a consistent size and makes great coffee. it also measures the amount so you don't have to watch it. My only beef with it is that it is messy. Really hard to get the grounds in the pot without spilling all over."
3,good but not perfect,It works fairly well. I have only had it for a few weeks. The usual problems with grounds sticking to side of container. Selection for number of cups to grind is not too good but it works.
1,Totally non-performing grinder!,"This burr grinder somehow performs worse than a blade grinder! It is totally useless for fine espresso grinding - the finest grind is far too coarse even for drip coffee in my opinion. Also, the grind is very inconsistent; in addition to the coarse grinds, you also get some over-fine dust. This renders the grinder unusable for any kind of coffee in my opinion.Espresso must be ground very fine, without dust that will block your espresso machine.However, regular drip or press coffees are also ruined by too much coffee dust.Spend a bit more for a working burr grinder, or just stick with a cheap blade grinder instead. Any positive reviews here must be from rather undiscerning drip / press coffee drinkers."
1,DOA,"Wife bought one of these at a fundraiser auction, still sealed in the box, but more than a year old. It was dead on arrival--I suspect one of the two safety interlock switches was defective. Manufacturer offered no help since product was out of warranty. So the machine went directly into the trash without ever grinding a single bean. I am still searching for an automatic burr mill, but it won't be this model for sure."
2,Not durable,"I have owned two of these. The first lasted a little over a year. The second only a couple of months. Both burned up during use. My wife and I drink cold brew coffee almost exclusively requiring that we grind a pound of coffee each about every two weeks. We were excited about the grinding capacity, but clearly this is not a unit meant for much use."
1,Almost useless,"This grinder is the absolute worst grinder I have owned. The finest grind is not acceptable for espresso. The coarse is good for french press. The plastic grind hopper holds static which makes it extremely difficult to pour the grinds without making a mess. Junk junk junk. I expected better from the Cuisinart name. Would make a great gift for someone you don't like. This should be on the $19.99 clearance shelf, then it would only be overpriced by $15.00."
2,2nd Broken One in 3 years,"This machine does good for french press or a coffee machine, certainly not for expresso machines. My problem is that I have had two of them that have broken after about 1.5 years of minimal use."
3,"Acceptable performance, with a couple of caveats","My main complaint about this unit, which I've been using for more than a year now, is that it is very difficult to replace the bin into the unit unless you hit the alignment exactly right. Many times I have had to give up and walk away rather than slam the thing to the floor. Other than that, yeah the static problem and lack of rounded corners makes it hard to empty out completely and clean up."
3,"Love the features, hate the unreliablity","This is the second DBM8 I've owned. The first one lasted about three months, and this one just cratered today after three months as well. I don't grind that much coffee, about 5# per month, this grinder should have lasted MUCH longer. I really like the features, but I don't want to continue to replace it every few months, so I'll look for another brand."
4,Burned out... but OK now!,"FWIW, mine lasted about 3 years. Just plugged it in this morning, and motor spinning very slowly, no grinds, then stops altogether t about 30 seconds. A slight burning smell.Nothing lasts forever, but I am a little surprised. Only used 3-4 times a week, so probably no more than 200-300 pots of coffee.Update June 2011:Mea culpa... Removed the grind cup and took a closer look. The small square hole at the back where the grinds come out was almost completely plugged with coffee grounds. Used a knife to clear and the grinder has been fine for the past 6 months. The switch to the moist, sticky beans of Starbucks French Roast did this, I think.Taking the rating from 2 to 4 stars."
1,Terrible Purchase,"This grinder looks nice when it comes out of the box. It has a reputable name on it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work -- at all! I used it three times, and it performed reasonably well. The fourth time I tried to use it, nothing happened. It wouldn't turn on, no matter what I did. No odd sounds from the motor, no smells indicating overheating -- nothing, silence, kaput! Doesn't even pretend to work. Oh well, once bitten, twice shy. Sorry Cuisinart, you'll never have me as a customer for any of your products ever again."
1,3 times Broken DO NOT BUY!,I have had 3 of these and they all have broken. I will stick with my old Braun grinder I have had for 15 years. The last one of these I bought only lasted about 3 months and then the motor burned out. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
4,Cusinart coffee grinder,"I like it. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is so noisy. I have to set it to fine to get the grind I wish, but then it is very good."
1,"It's junk, and the service is no better","The grinder works fine until it dies, which is frequently. I received two new replacement units (it took as long as four months to receive them, and I had to pay a service fee and shipping on the dead ones). So among three brand-new grinders, none lasted beyond five months. The final one just died and there is no more warranty. The experience has put me off anything made by Cuisinart for life."
1,Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!,This is a waste of your money! Threads broke off bean chamber sent 2 replacement neither fit. Say I'm now out of warranty. I bought this in January if your product sits on the shelf for a while your s.o.l. Supervisors and customer service are rude and demeaning. I will not buy any more products from them if this is what I will have to deal with. This is not okay cuisinart. They even make you pay for shipping on machine and replacement parts if they feel like it.
2,would not buy again,This grinder produced an inconsistent grind and was noisy. It also quit working after two years. Smoke started coming out of it! Of course the warranty was for 18 months so we were out of luck.
2,Died--Warranty?,"My unit lasted a year and went KAFLOOY. When I tried to exercise the warranty (I had 6 months left) I was directed to ship the unit to Arizona, pay $4 and I would, in due time, receive back a unit that had only a 3 month warranty! I figured for a $40 item the process wasn't worth it. The grinder ended up in the garbage along with my opinion of Cuisinart."
2,Cuisnart Burr Mill,"Worst thing about the grinder is how difficult it is to get the box in after you have ground the coffee. It can take 10- 20 trys to get it over the button on the bottom. Also, disappointed that the setting is for a mimium of 4 cups which is more than I make for myself or even sometimes myself and my husband. I find that the 4 cups is too strong but I could work with that if it had a 2 or 3 cup option."
5,Excellent,"Great price, works great (I can almost say better than some commercial ones), amazing quality"
2,Noisy and dirty,"This unit is the least expensive widely-available burr grinder. Though it served me fairly well for over 3 yrs, I was glad that it stopped working recently so I could justify stepping up to the better-in-every-way Bodum model.It's noisy and produces a lot of dust in all grind resolution settings. The dust tends to cake up in the upper corner of the grinds bin so you have to take some care not to make a mess when opening the lid. Also,the dust can lead to excessive sludge when using a press.The plastic threaded bottom of the hopper assembly broke about 6 months in and multiple support inquiries through cuisinart's site went ignored. I was able to repair it myself and I will not be purchasing any cuisinart products in the future."
2,Watch out for STATIC!!!!!!!!,"It does grind well and adjusts to a fine or coarse grind evenly, but unfortunately because of the plastic catch(I guess) it creates a static mess and grinds fly everywhere when you take the catch out and remove the lid. Even when you pour the grinds into the filter they fly across the top of the pot. This is going back to the store and I will try to find a better burr grinder with less or hopefully no static!"
1,Disappointing lack of durability,"For a little while this was a pretty good grinder. It quietly stopped working a few months after I bought it. I used it for personal use once a day, every day of the week. This should have been through much harsher testing by the manufacturer.- poor quality+ When it did work, the coffee grind was consistent. The quality of brewed coffee was noticably better than that made with coffee chopped in a spice mill.- grinding coffee was messy due to static and its effect on the grounds- this device is too bulky; competitors offer much sleaker form factorsI would not buy this product again, nor would I buy and electrical device from Cuisinart. Four months is too short a lifespan."
2,LOUD Coffee grinder,"I recieved a Supreme Grind Burr Mill Model # DBM-8 for Christmas. I was extremely disappointed IN the LOUD NOISE IT MAKES WHILE GRINDING. So loud that we can hear it outside of the house. Unbelievable for a Quisinart product. My cheap $15.00 grinder is quiter and faster. Getting the grind and the cups to match what we like was a game in it self, requiring a lot of pots to get it right. Thank goodness it was a gift because I would never buy it on my own. It's going back into the box and I'm using my cheap model. This way I won't wake the dead, NOT KIDDING!"
4,Great Grinder,"Love this grinder. It's so much better when the ground coffee actually drops down into a canister instead of sitting in a hopper and being reground. The grind is consistent, and I really like the range of settings."
3,Works as described,"The actual ground coffee from this is perfect. However, it does make a mess, at noted in other reviews. Keep it clean and it works just fine, this is probably the best option for under $100."
2,Not what was expected from the Cuisinart brand,"You expect a coffee mill, especially wearing the Cuisinart brand, to do a better job than the much less expensive blade grinders. Unfortunately, this coffee mill does not make a significantly better, more even grind than the $20.00 alternative."
1,Disappointing.,"I'm very disappointed in this product. I was looking for a coffe grinder that would give a more consistent grind than the blade grinders I have tried. My experience with this grinder is that it is no more consistent than a blade grinder. I get everything from powdered coffee to the grind I selected. Not only is the grind consistency very poor, it runs at a very high rpm and is extremely noisy. It is louder than my blade grinders. If you're into a lot of noise and varied grind sizes in your coffee, then this is you're grinder. If you want something that doesn't sound like you're sanding hardwood floors and actually gives a consistent grind then keep looking."
4,Great for the money,"We wanted to up the ante on our coffee experience once we got a nice espresso machine, so we made the switch from a blade grinder to a burr grinder. This machine works really well. We're very happy with it. It does require regular cleaning, as the grounds get caught up where they come out into the catcher. This part is difficult to clean. But other than that, a great little tool for a nice cup of coffee."
1,Not bad until it stopped working,"I bought this to use with an auto-drip. It was my first coffee grinder. I generally enjoyed it and the flavor of my coffee until it stopped working after less than 6 months. That is simply an unacceptable lifespan for a relatively simple appliance. Otherwise I agree with other comments that it is noisy, messy, and creates a good amount of powder. I could have lived with those minor complaints and given this 3 or 4 stars if it was reliable. But it isn't - on to another brand..."
2,Liked it while it worked,I liked this grinder for the first two years that I was using it. It did it's job and made a good grind for my single cup drip. Then one day it stopped working and my girlfriend noticed that some screws had fallen out of the grinding plates. We got a new top which included the grinding plates and it just stopped working. Bummer. I was hoping to get quality from the Cuisinart brand. You pay a little more and you hope that it lasts a long time. Not with this one. Lost faith with Cuisinart quality from my experience with this machine. Lame.
2,Poor quality,"Don't be fool by the big brand name! This unit is extremely loud and never yield good ground quality. I have owned it for over a year and I am not happy with it.The unit produce too much coffee dust in all different settings. I noticed the burr is already wore out. Hey, I only use this once a week in average! How can this happen?"
4,Great Grinder,"We both really like this grinder. It was a Christmas present for my husband. No fuss, no mess. Easy to operate."
2,outer cosmetics obscure cheap internal components,"Works great when it's new. Noisy, but all burr mills are inherently noisy. Problem is that the internal workings are housed in bakelite and that gives the unit a short life. Under daily use, you can expect the unit to fail within the first 24 months, and when the bakelite internal components shatter, it sounds like the unit will explode! A+ for quality of grind. An F- for durability."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Like many others, I bought this hoping it would do a great job, that the name Cuisinart would mean quality, and that it would look great in the process. Well, the last one it did, until I threw the unit in the trash. Like many others, I was so-so impressed with its grinding accuracy. But, the biggest disappointment was its failing within the first year of light use. The power switch simply stopped working. Real shame, I had equipped my entire kitchen with Cuisinart products [coffee maker, juicer, toaster, griddler, can opener, blender]. But this one was a terrible buy. Don't get one, you'll likely be sorry."
1,Lost Power. Failed. Will Not Buy Another,Initially I gave this product five stars. It worked well for about 150 grinds. Then it stopped altogether. No obvious cause. Safety interlock switch OK. 120v input OK.Problem must be in the circuit card. We'll just go back to a cheap coffee grinder and avoid cost and hassle. No m ore Cuisinart products for us.
1,Won't grind fine enough for espresso,"Don't buy this unit if you plan to make espresso. Even at the finest grind setting, I got granulated coffee instead of the powdery consistency needed for espresso. I made two of the most watery cups of espresso I think I ever drank (ick!) and decided I couldn't possibly live with this grinder."
1,Don't buy Cuisinart Burr Grinder doesn't grind fine,"This is our second burr grinder, the first Capresso Infinity worked great, but died after 2 years of daily use.Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme does't grind fine enough for our Pump style (La Pavoni) espresso machine. It would be fine for coarser grinds and I like the on off button set up and capture unit...but it is a total loser for anybody requiring very finely ground espresso.I'm going back to the Capresso Infinity, seems to be the best for the lower price point...tho I think $90 is enough for such an item."
4,"great grinder,but loud","I love this grinder you have many grinding options with this machine,but the reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is it is sooo noisey,but arent they all??"
2,"Great When Working, Lots Of Switch Issues","I've been through two of these, they seem to have some serious switch issues. The first one I had the start switch burned out within 30 days so I returned it. The second one, the timer switch burned out in about 90 days, I continued to use it it and now after 6 or 8 months, the start switch is burned out.It's a nice design, holds plenty of beans and does a good job grinding coffee, it's really too bad the build quality isn't a little better, if it were I'd be giving this item 5 stars."
4,Coffee Grinder,"Excellent grinder. Lets me select specific grind, large top filling area for coffee andlidded box for ground coffee - stays fresher. Is VERY LOUD when grinding. My ancient 30year old grinder (which finally broke down) was just as loud - I suspect that grinding hard coffee beans is always aloud task. Aside from the noise, which may be impossible to avoid, I would give this grinder 5 stars."
1,Crap,"First of all Amazon why rip people off, I purchased this piece of crap at Bed Bath and Beyond for $40, you have it starting @ $90, as consumers we're not stupid but your excessive markup certainly makes you look like crap. The grinder crapped out on me after 90 days, it is extremely noisy and it takes less time to brew 10 cups then it takes this unit to fine grind the same amount of beans. Don't waste your money and Amazon, get real!!! Kim Kramer"
1,stopped working after 12 grinds,"You would think cuisinart would be able to design a good burr mill,Wrong!After 12 grinds Nothing! You are better off buying a hammer and a pillow case to pound your beans."
1,Disappointing Quality,"After three months, the switch failed. Failed to turn off, that is. It went through all the beans in the hopper, and continued to grind on for a bit longer. I'm very disappointed. I used my Braun burr grinder for 15 years and only retired it because the seal between the grinder and the collection cup wore out. Cuisinart quality isn't what it used to be."
1,don't buy,"I bought this thinking I would be able to regulate the size, (I have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works), to say it is loud is an understatement, & 1st thing in the AM. I had it about 2 weeks, when I noticed it was hot to the touch, and it no longer worked, mind you I had not used it in 2 days, and had moved it to clean. I have not contacted them at this point, but do not want a replacement, and a part of me is glad it broke, so I don't have to listen to the noise anymore."
2,Motor is not durable,"At the third time I used this grinder, the motor smells after 3 minutes of operations. It started with a burning smell and gradually slow down. I am very upset about the outcome..."
2,"Decent, but no more","Source control is critical, and for small scale operations this app works great. Occasionally there's some db corruption, but in general you should do alright. But it really doesn't scale, lacks many features, and hasn't had any significant feature additions, or development effort in years. Sometimes I think there are no developers currently working on this app at all. There's got to be a better way."
5,It's funny! It's informative! It's a must see!,"Don't let the date fool you. Every bit of information is as pertinent today as it was when this video was first produced. Phyllis diller fans will not be disappointed. Yet, she is quite thorough in her methodic approach to how to have a very successful garage sale.My wife and I employ many of her ideas outlined in this video when we have our own yard sales and we have never made anything less than $1,000 or more!This is a must have, must see, must do video. Pass it up and you pass up the know how to earn optimum dollar at all your yard sales.Don't be foolish. Get the video today! You'll love it!"
5,Great for the beginners,"This is my second time around with Geri Larkin. I was feeling a little lost about a year and a half ago. Found her book, Stumbling Towards Enlightnment ( I was drawn to the beautiful cover!), and I was hooked! This woman is light hearted, really funny, easy to read,and gives us novice ""stumblers"" a good look at the Buddhist life. She makes you feel as if you are right there, experincing the moments with her. Something, I feel, is the duty of a good author. Thru humor you will learn, and hopefully a little of this 'tap dancing' will change your life, as it did mine! If you are curious about Buddhism, or just need to escape your traditional ways of handling life-READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Great and healthy snack,These bars are great for people with a sweet tooth that want something healthy. Highly recommended!
4,"Great inexpensive healthy snack, but slightly bland","I'm a big fan of all kinds of fresh fruit and real fruit flavored snacks (I hate the candy flavors that taste nothing like the actual fruit), and apricots are my favorite. The taste of this bar was slightly disappointing.It says ""2 apples in every bar"", and I can taste it. The flavor is 60% apricot 40% apple, which is ok, but I was expecting more apricot. The texture reminds me of a pressed apple with the juice taken out, it's called a ""fruit and fiber bar"" and not just a ""fruit bar"" for a reason.It's definitely a very healthy snack. And I especially appreciate just how much food you're getting for your money."
4,Amazing CD!,"The Best Anthems Ever is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. This is an astounding CD that doesn't contain a single song that I dislike. It has a wonderful selection of songs from many music genres. Even some of the songs that I had never heard before buying this CD were very impressive. I would recommend this CD to anyone because of the wide variety of music. If you like Blur, Bush, The Foo Fighters, or Prodigy you are bound to love this CD as much as I do."
1,Think before you Buy,"If you're looking for a collection of the best Industrial bands WORST songs, look here. They took great bands, and made an excellent piece of trash. They must've been looking for the most terrible songs done by these bands and slapped them together. It's a disgrace to the Gods of Industrial like them. The song Evil Dust is the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life. Industrial fans: AVOID!"
3,Hard To Fold Up.,"The delivery was fast, i got it in two days. I bought this for my hubby that loves soccer and he liked it except when we opened it it was very big but nice. We set it up and we then tried putting it away and it was very difficult. Its hard without having another person there to help you. We finally got it away and decided to return it. Its not what i expected. If your not going to be traveling with this like to the park or anything and just keeping it set up outside then this is a great product for you. I live in Oklahoma and the weather here is bi polar and unpredictable so we would have to put it away alot. Other then that its nice just not the right product for us. Thanks hope this helped."
3,Fools Crow,"I am having to read this book in my english class, and I do not like it. The book was in okay condition, would have been better without all of the writing in it."
4,Book purchase,"A little more wear than I was expecting from the description, but it arrived on time. No real complaints. It reads like a book."
5,A Keeper!,"A wonderful story of how friendships can form despite differences. One of my earliest memories is of the day I claimed to ""read"" and proudly recited this book back to my parents.In the 80's when I was in college, my mother traveled to what was the USSR and discovered that the two countries with the highest per capita consumption of ice cream were the U.S. and Russia. As love of ice cream is the common ground that Joe and Sam discover, she thought a dual translation of the book could serve as a wonderful point of connection to use for improving relations between the two countries. She tried to track down the book at that time. It was already out of print, but the project is still on my to do list.This is one of the few books from our childhood that my parents kept, despite the fact that it is in tatters. Its a keeper!"
4,It worked for me,"This was a good investment. It would be even better if I didn't get so big so fast, but it did the job. I got a couple more months out of my regular clothes. The only complaint I had was it was snug around my hips and loose around my waist. SO if you're larger in the hip area, flip it so the wider end is over your hips for a better fit the rest of it stretches enough to accommodate a growing belly."
4,Great Literature,"I read this book many years ago whilst still in high school, as part of the literature syllabus. On the surface, this book seems to portray a story of a long standing rivaly between two tribes over a pond. But upon deeper inspection, this story infact gives us an insight into the political and social beliefs of a community of people. The great pond itself, was simply not just a watering hole, but it was the ""be all"" and ""end all"" of a way of life; it was to die for; and Elechi, through his exceptional ability to bring the story to life, allows the reader to decend into the very fabric of a war; never-ending and tragic. This is a beautiful, well-written story and political commentary, and I would highly recommend it."
1,Rabbits are cute. This is not,"Larry Brown's south is the stereotypical Southern White Trash Redneck and his characters aren't the least bit likeable. The ""hero"" worries about his ability to satisfy his wife, but she's such a tramp the reader wonders why. The abuse victim acts out of character for someone who's been so severely violated, and that's just one of the flaws. Don't waste your time."
5,Must Have,This is a must have is you have a Zen Stone. This skin fits perfectly on the Zen Stone and allows you to clip it on your shorts. The clip part of this skin is removable which is convenient for when you just want to listen to it from your pocket. I highly recommend this product.
4,Solid Set By One Of The Underrated Greats,"This is a really solid CD. Luther and the boys pound through two discs worth of smokin' electric blues, with a song selection weighted toward his later releases (also Aligator). The only reason I took off one star is that there are other live blues CDs in this style that I like better. Try Son Seals' ""Live & Burning"". It's a little more ""raw"", and it mixes the tempo better."
3,More vacuum pressure needed,"Great easy to use appliance but the suction pressure could be greater. Then again, a larger motor and heavier hand module would not be so desireable..."
1,Horrible!,"This product is horrible. I have been really needing a floor cleaner because my cat is gettin older and having some ""accidents"" and it was the worst. I bought it becasue it was only $40.00 and didnt think it would be that bad. I tried it out when I got home and the vacuum didn't suck anything up! Maybe a table spoon of water at most! I should have researched before I bought. I took it back the next day and exchanged it for a little green pro heat (which I love!). Its a bit more but well worth it. Save yourself and don't buy the dirt devil."
4,Love this product!,"I am very surprised that this product received only two stars. This product has been such a lifesaver and I am a big fan! I have two cats that constantly vomit on my carpet and thanks to this product, you would never even know it. I've even had guests complement me on how new my carpet looks. What I love best about this product is that it's small, compact and effectively vacuums the gunk out of the carpet, preventing any future odors. I haven't used the scrub brush feature much since the vacuum mechanism tends to do the job just fine, often in one treatment! For those that talk about the soiled water that sprays out of the vents...this has happened to me, but only because I've filled the tank beyond the fill line. Use this appliance properly and you shouldn't have a problem."
1,Buy a Bissell instead,"I had a similar Bissell spot cleaner for several years and wore it out (I have pets and kids). I couldn't find that kind anymore and this was about the same size, price and design. It's TERRIBLE! Difficult to open the clean and dirty water tanks. I have to use a knife to pry open the rubber tab to dispose of the dirty water. The bristles began flatten out after the 4th use."
4,"Very handy, worth the money.","I have a big carpet steam, but I refuse to use it often--too much work and too heavy for me. My pets sometimes have accidents on the carpet, this handheld scrubber then becomes very handy -- just plug it in and turn it on, no sweat like using the big heavy one I have which also can NOT clean the corners around the house. For this price, it works great, I have no complaints."
5,Great book.,"I highly recommend this book. Many high school juniors/seniors find it difficult to put the effort into studying for the SATs. The Underground Guide to the SATs makes that task tolerable at least and very enjoyable at best. Four years later, I still use the tips, tricks and vocabulary memorization techniques I learned from the book in my schoolwork in college. My score on the SATs improved from 1170 to 1360. You won't be disappointed."
4,Community Policing,The book came quickly at a fair price in great condition. Would buy from them again and recommend.

1,Cutters that Don't Cut,The cutters did not open well and did not cut wire. Wrote to the company and they agreed they were not easy to use and didn't perform as expected and said they planned to discontinue item. The company was very prompt in replying to my complaint and sent me a full refund.
4,Easy read-wealth of knowledge,"unlike many books coming out, which are more like reworked thesis papers from dried up PHd programs, this book was readable and enjoyable."
1,"wonderful prose, but uninteresting story","As someone who has suffered from depression for as long as can remember, I believe the author failed to convey the absolute horror depression inflicts on the lives, family, and friends of sufferers. She writes so beautifully that I feel that she is mostly concerned with turning a phrase to showcase her skill as a writer. The 'dialogue' in the book seems stilted and planned. The characters seemed to fit to neatly into her narrative and real life is just not that way. While I am happy that she has been able to launch a literary career, her first effort has left me cold."
1,"Childish, sycophantic drivel","What a waste of tree. Whether you like George Bush or you don't, this book tells you nothing. It's a perfect biography for an 8th grade book report. Gives you a few names of Bush buddies, some two- or three-word explanations of who they are (every investor gave not only money, but spiritual or moral support); then, onto the next endearing story about Barb, mother of the decade."
4,safety forks,"I gave these as a gift. They look like they are more than adequate for the job. The recipients have young kids, and I was concerned for them -- plus, i don't think it will be possible to lose a hot dog or a marshmallow to the fire. One improvement I'd like to suggest is redesign them to be collapsible/extendable."
1,What I Believe,I love McEwan and have many of his works. He is a great writer and this book is very well written but I find the subject content to be so depressing that I could not read beyond the second chapter. Jeannine
3,Short Statement,"It was a horror story. I wasn't expecting that. I couldn't finish it. I bought it to read as I traveled. But I was experiencing so many lonely, scary horrors during my awful trip that the book put me right over the top. Read about half. It was well-written, but not what I thought it would be. Sorry."
3,The Beauty and Horror of this Garden,"When I first started to read THE CEMENT GARDEN, I thought that it was slightly interesting but slow moving. The end of the book completely changed my opinion. Throughout the whole book I knew in the back of my mind that Julie and Jack did not share an ordinary brother/sister relationship but I did not know if McEwan would follow through on this premonition. This premonition did not prepare me for the ending.When I first read the last chapter of the book, Julie and Jack's incest disgusted me, but upon a second reading, I saw the beauty of the situation and I could not stop reading it.Not for the prudish or the faint of heart, but a good read all the same."
1,Horrible,These shoes are awful. They're cheaply made and you can't even get your foot inside because of where they place the VERY SMALL straps. Never again.
2,Did not work for me,"I tried this product because it was recommended by a friend who had been through menopause. After 6 weeks of use it still did nothing to reduce or relieve my night sweats and hot flashes. The only thing it may have done is help me mentally and emotionally. I hope it helps someone else, but for me, it did not work."
3,"THOUGH FORMULAIC,THIS FILM STILL MANAGES TO ENTERTAIN.","TRAVOLTA AND HOFFMAN'S PERFORMANCES ALSO HIGHLIGHT THIS FILM. IT'S ABOUT A MAN WHO TAKES HOSTAGES AT A NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM THAT HE GOT FIRED FROM. THE TRAVOLTA/HOFFMAN CHEMISTRY IS GOOD AND YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL SORRY FOR TRAVOLTA'S CHARACTER,SAMUEL BAILEY. THIS FILM MIGHT EVEN BRING A TEAR TO YOUR EYE."
4,Different,"What a haunting set of tunes. The more I listen to this album, the more I appreciate the originality. A must have for any serious soundtrack music lover."
3,Its OK,"Very good music and great guitar. However, because it was live and in some type of entertainment facility, there is a lot of hollow echo. That detracts from the quality of the music. Some voices are muffled and hard to understand. Otherwise, good."
3,meat and potatoes?,Sure it touches on good points but leaves you wanting more of in-depth material. In my opinion its not very comprehensive. If you're looking for something to give you some ideas but not the how to's - bingo!
4,Fun read aloud book,"I read this to my children, 9 and 7 years old. They both enjoyed the story and it moved quickly enough to keep both of thier attentions. It was funny in parts and had enough suspense to entertain them. My youngest son would recite to his Dad what we had read the evening before. It had a few scary elements (the needle teeth on stuffed animals) but it was not so much that I would balk at recommending it to read with your children. Over all it was a fun book."
1,Poor showing for Accliam's last WWF game!,"This game was released way to early in my opinion. This is the PSX version with better sound. Acclaim lost it's WWF license on Nov 15th and had to get this game out by then to score the $$$. It shows. The introductions are cool but most moves require a 3 joystick + 2 button combo. C'mon! This isn't Mortal Kombat, it's wrestling. I wish this was more like the WCW/NWO Revenge for the N64."
1,What were they thinking?,"What were these people thinking? This game is very slow and dull. Even playing with a friend this game has nothing to offer, probably even less than playing it by yourself. Special moves are almost imposible to start, and without them you're left with kicking each other to a pulp.The graphics look like they were not changed at all from the Nintendo and Sony versions. Graphics are NOT up to Dreamcasts 128bit standards.This could have been a great game. It should have been completely reworked for the Dreamcast to better use the speed and graphics capabilities. They really missed the mark on this one.To Make this short and sweet...This game sucks, don't get it."
4,Good Quality Product,"No complaint about the product; I only wished I had purchased the reverse-able version which I thought I was buying based on the picture (which seems to show the reverse-able switch; however, it's actually a shadow). After looking closer at the picture, it was my carelessness and fault."
1,disapointment...,"Yes, this book is a guide. But it is not a guide to international business communications. It describes how to write the international addresses very deeply. It might be a helpful book to a secretary who writes addresses to envelopes. But it won't help to any businessman at all. Merriam-Webster do not deserve this ""one star"" rating. The rating is there for amazon.com. Because the information about the book was quite open to misunderstand the content and I had to return the book."
4,Good value for money,"Although relatively expensive than other alternatives but very reliable and the battery time is good (10 hours), very easy to use and good value for money, I tried both Jabra and plaintronics and I am happy with this one"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The fantasy here is by way of horror. A human that ends up in this world, after crossing over from our own is basically then stuck in a Clive Barker book, a very nasty and horrific situation. A similar feel to Mark Chadbourn's World's End, or Sean Williams Crooked Letter.Humans affected by the supernatural powers around them struggle greatly with the concept, apart from the actual basic facts of survival."
1,Soooo dissapointed/unreadable!,"I love fantasy and sci fi.....I really do. I went to the effort (not mention expense) of ordering this book from the USA (I'm in Australia)...I waited in keen anticipation, the book arrived after the usual month or so of travel time, I eagerly began to read and couldn't get past page 79 (though I did also read the little bit containing personal revelations at the end of the second book). Maybe it's just me...plenty of people seem to have adored this book, which is one of the reasons I bought it, but, in the final analysis I thought it seemed a bit silly, tired, scrambled and confused and much too slow to get to the point (so was Michael... nobody could be that unperturbed by the situation in which he found himself)...did it/he ever get to the point? I really couldn't flog myself any further to find out. I highly recommend you read GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire instead."
2,"Interesting concept, falls short with religious interplay","I have completed the first book, The Infinity Concerto, and I will not continue to the second. His ideas are stimulating and thought provoking. For that, I give him the 2 stars. Otherwise, at times the main character can be simply annoying. As a Christian, I found his repetitive use blasphemous language to be unnecessary and damaging to the story. His insertion of the character's spiritual crisis late in the book is unconnected and seemingly superfluous to the story. It had enjoyable parts to it, and at times I did enjoy his prose. I would consider reading another of his books, if he has left this characteristic behind."
5,"inspirational, well-done, descriptive","Greg Bear really wrote a gem with these two novels... they grab you by the wrist and pull you along the entire story...full of adventure, mysticism, mystery, and even a hint of truth behind the words...its hard to praise it enough, the books in themselves are a song of power in their own right"
4,A Masterpiece,"Dungeon Family are pioneers in invoted hip hop. This is a great disc if you love outkast or goodie mob, your brain takes control of this album. BUy now"
3,The production and guest stars save this album,"Being a huge Dungeon Family album collector, I had to pick up this album. I remembered EJ the Witchdoctor from such past hits as OutKast's ""Ova Da Wudz"" and I thought his voice was really cool. Unfortunately, on this album, he doesn't show much rhyme display.It's not that he's totally wack, it's that his rhymes consist of typical gangsta topics, such as women and drugs. When he's not talking about those things, he's dropping religious knowledge (which I can appreciate, but others may not be able to). I like ""Dez Only 1"" (with OutKast), ""Island Konanane"", and a few others, but that's only because of the smooth music that Organized Noize laid down and/or the tight rhymes that the other Dungeon Family members give (even Cool Breeze outshines Witchdoctor in one song). If it weren't for these factors, this album would be a perfect drink coaster."
4,Good book for basic fixed income investing,This is a must read for anyone who wants to know about bonds and fixed income investing in general.I wish I had read this earlier but that happens with most of us. I am glad that I ordered this now and have almost finished it reading.
1,"Buyer Beware: ""like new"" does not mean ""like new""","This book is heavily marked up though it was listed as ""like new"". Buyer Beware of descriptions on this site."
3,"Sublime flatpicking, lots of harmonica","The guitar work here is excellent, just as you'd expect it to be. The harmonica work nearly overwhelms it, though, and adds a little too much cornpone for me. If you like bluegrass harmonica that's great - this is certainly the cd for you, as you won't find better flatpicking accompaniment with a harmonica player to my knowledge. If you prefer an emphasis on flatpicking, though, there are likely many better options."
4,Good introduction to the topic,"Clearly written, good for the smart layperson. A helpful and persuasive introduction to law and economics as concieved by the Chicago school, though some of Friedman's more radical policy suggestions (nearer the end) may make you wonder if we haven't missed something conceptually important; I also recommend Malloy's ""Law and Economics"" for a broader perspective that offers a critique of the implicit assumptions Friedman's chosen model without endorsing a contrary position. (For those who do want the contrary of Friedman's viewpoint, there's the whole field of critical legal studies out there.)"
3,A continuation of a riveting story...,"I strongly recommend reading the first Maus before starting this book. In this book, the author's relationship with his father is explored further, and we get to see how his father survived the Holocaust. The horrors this one man went through make it seem unbelievable that he is alive to tell his story. The theme of Art's struggle of accepting his religion is also explored as a sub-theme. The illustrations are also much more detailed than a first thought, so make sure you take a good look at them."
1,dangerous to use as history,"I am deeply concerned about people using this comic as a history text. Poland and Polish people hardly deserve to be portrayed as ""pigs"". It appears that people who love this version of ""history as comic"" are wilfully blind to the fact that Poles and Polish Jews were murdered in equal numbers by the Germans. In Eastern Poland, where most of the Jewish community resided, the Soviets invaded in 1939 and deported or exterminated the educated Polish populace. The remaining Poles were subjected to extreme terror. To suggest that the Poles were willing accomplices in the destruction of the Jewish people is a liable. One could just as easily write a comic about the occupation of Eastern Poland by the Soviets and cast Jewish people as ""pigs"". You can imagine the reaction to that. Maus is another example of ""acceptable bigotry"". ""Acceptable"" only because the group being liabled is not politcally strong enough to challenge this terrible distortion."
4,Compelling Story - Read it,"Like Maus I this book can be read in an hour or so. Vladek's story of survival at Auschwitz is incredible. As a baby boomer I didn't live during this era. Having descended from Germans I have studied this period and have wondered how this could have happened. I'm not going to pretend to really understand what happened and what it was like. I have read other personal accounts of the holocaust but due, I guess, to the comic book format I found this much more accessible. We all should understand as much as we can about this horrific period of history. With just a small investment of time Maus I and II will provide to you a dramatic survivor's experience. We should never forget that this actually happened."
1,not good,Bought this tank for my son. He played indoors with it for one hour. One of the tracks stop going forward. The track would go backwards but not forwards. Company does not return calls. I have called them 4 times in the last week. I would not buy it.
1,Big Price Crappy Value,"I bought one of these too 9 months ago. The plastic was substandard, the barrel was broken inside the box but invisible to the purchaser. After about one hour of use, the drive gear area developed a crack and wouldn't run properly. I tried to contact the company for repair/replacement and they never once replied to my calls or emails. Fortunately it was on sale for 1/2 the price. I will certainly never do business again with this company. It should really be ashamed of its self for peddling such junk."
3,Another 60s Spy Spoof,Raquel's ravishing as a skydiving dental hygienist in this 60s spy spoof that may not be anything special but is still kind of cute. There are three action set pieces that are better than anything in the Flint movies. Wonderfully dated score by John Dankworth.
1,It's ok!,"If you are a beginner, this is definitely the video for you. I love steop aerobics but this was not intense enough for me."
5,Love this Video,I just worked out to this video and I really love it. Its a great work out. Easy to follow and Cathe is a great instructor. I cant wait to do this work out agian.
1,didn't like this one either,I ordered this one as well thinking I was replacing a stepper dvd that came with a stepper I purchased awhile back. It wasn't the same dvd but the picture on the front was identical. My original dvd is missing and I wanted to replace it as I absolutely loved it so I was highly disappointed this was not the one I wanted and I can't find the one I had. :(
5,Very convenient travel cart,"Although I had a ballhopper with a 75-ball capacity, I bought this product for three reasons: (1) larger capacity (this one comes at 150 balls), (2) to ease pain on the shoulder when you carry them (ballhopper's thin handles really hurt your shoulder), and (3) rolling on the ground. This cart satisfied me on all three counts."
1,disappointing,"I read the little book it came with, which I did like, but the cards I did not. Very good idea, but the illistrations are hard to understand. And the directions don't coincide with the pictures. I am going to try Tim Clark's yoga cards, ""create your own yoga program."""
1,poor quality version,this review is for the kindle version and is mot commentary om the work itself.at first i didnt realize i was in the poetry. there were no line breaks except between stanzas. if it werent for the capitals where a new line should have been i would have been hopelssly lost.review written from my kindle.
2,Definitely an acquired taste,Just a cautionary note to check this out before parting with any money. Make sure you like what you hear first because most people who expect a symphony to have some sort of unifying structure and thematic development will almost certainly find this ( like most Hovhaness ) unbearably schmalzy and boring.
1,First Half Excellent...Second Half Tedious,Let me say I adore Julie Salamon's writing. The Devil's Candy was an awesome book.And I adored the first half of this book which was engagingly written and exhaustively researched. The stories of the women in the group and their children were touching.But something happens after the deaths of the Rowe family. The book becomes a compendium of Robert Rowe's attempts to become a lawyer again...and the whole Colleen section was just maddening. She comes off as completely unlikeable and we're never quite clear what she sees in this man who took out his whole family.This book is a mess...and not worth recommending at all.
3,Hard to swallow...,"So a man can kill his family and be mainstreamed in a few years...while Andrea Yates and Susan Smith are seen as monsters - candidates for the death penalty/life imprisonment. Boy, is this ever a lesson in gender inequity.The author tries to convince us, by showing us how ""good"" the murderer really is and the difficulties of raising a disabled child, that this is a special case situation. At least, that's how it feels. I don't believe in the death penalty, but I think this guy got off easy, except, of course, for his own conscience...maybe if he'd received truly compensatory justice he wouldn't have had to suffer his own miserable thinking."
5,A truly thought-provoking read,"This book was truly thought-provoking and emotionally charged. Julie Salamon's retelling of the events that led to the tragedy in the story lead the reader on the emotional roller coaster that his family, friends and he, himself must have gone through. The book is inviting and easily readable. I couldn't wait to turn the page to read the next turn of events in this amazing story. The end of the book is truly incredible as Julie enters the dialogue with the mothers group. This is a story like no-other. I can't wait to talk about it with my book group."
4,Attention True Crime Readers,"Fans of Ann Rule should like this book. Although Julie Salamon does not delve into the motivation of Bob Rowe as much as I would have liked, she nonetheless tells a fascinating story of mental illness, murder and the hardships of raising a handicapped child. The unusual twist to this story is the debate between what is guilt, innocence, or ""not guilty by reason of mental defect""."
3,Well written but way off the mark,"4 people were murdered yet we're supposed to accept Bob Rowe becuase he was ""reborn"" after a 2 year country club stay in a psychiatric hospital. Julie Salamon has come through with a well written book but the focus is way off target. There is not enough emphasis on the lives of the murdered ones. Instead, Salamon chooses to focus on the ""love story"" between the non repentent Rowe and the obviously deranged and damaged second wife. The absense of actual testimony from Rowes surving brother makes the whole book suspect and unreliable in terms of fact. This book should not have been written without gathering all the facts but its still worth reading from a fictional standpoint."
1,Shameless Drivel,"I waited a year before I could voice my opinion on this book. Why? The poor and misguided research mixed with the bad writing skills of the author made me laugh so hard, I had to wait! She left out key facts about Mr. Rowe (his childhood? his relationship with co-workers/his brother? His ""other"" relationships before he met that looney Colleen? Colleens past (obviously messed up)? His manipulative behavior which was obviously the one constant in his miserable life?). The author chose to write the book even though the facts are distorted or are missing entirely. Thank God this book dropped quicker than a stone in water! Don't buy this...!!!!!"
3,This book is blowing but good,"I found this book to be well written but disturbing in its tone and analysis or lack thereof. I find the author's tone to be too forgiving of Mr. Rowe- the real victims, his children, first wife and those whose lives were touched by them have little voice in this book. Mr. Rowe is treated as though he was the victim because of his handicapped child, which is the real tragedy. I also found there to be too much emphasis in the book on Mr. Rowe's second wife Colleen, who appears to be more deranged and need of psychiatric help than Mr. Rowe. The true heroes in this book are the Brooklyn mothers. The sick ""love story"" in the second half of this book should be for reserved for fans of Inside Edition."
3,Crisp writing. Addictive.,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
1,Dated and awkward,"I will admit I only bought this book because E. Nesbit's Wouldbegoods are always talking about it and I wanted to find the things that influenced Nesbit.I can't get past page 10 of this thing. The language is very dated, English schoolboy slang, and I can't figure out half of what they are saying. It's not interesting enough to keep me trying to read it."
4,How to make Love to a Woman,"Well let me just say that I more than ADORE Ian Somerhalder...it was not enough of him in this movie but it was still quite interesting...I kinda feel as if Andy didn't not deserve to get the girl, he was selfish and sometimes cruel because he had low-self-esteem...I mean you went out with the chick for a whole year and she never ""got to go florida"" that's selfish...but the film was pretty good none the less..I mean it's worth watching :)"
5,I played this on the Phillips CD-I system,"I must have played through this game at least 10 times. The whole game is a cartoon, you pretty much just select where to go or what item to use at certain points in the game. You also get an inventory and can hold items. I enjoyed this game because I just love cartoon games (dragon's lair, Kingdom 2, etc.) It's fun trying to find the fastest way through this game. The animation and music is great.!!! Kingdom 2 is even better !"
3,This Cd was OK,I think this cd was cute and it had cute songs like the MOVERS Rap thing and the Princess thing. I like those two songs.
4,Quick Overview,"I believe the book is well written and informative. The hypnosis CD is a very helpful aid to quit smoking. However, it is unlikely that a person with a long term habit will quit smoking with one session! Your expectations must be realistic.I have not quit yet! But I am confident that by listening to the CD several times I will be able to quit a 20 yr. habit. With the CD and determination a person can quit. I recommend this book and CD combo. to any person who want to quit smoking.Philip R."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this book primarily to supplement the other study materials I have and for a few extra practice tests, and I have been tremendously disappointed. The number of errors in the CD-ROM is absolutely shocking. Between the questions that don't give all the information needed to answer the question, the questions that are marked wrong, when they are, in fact, correct, and the questions that don't even give the correct answer as a choice, this is more of a burden than a study tool.In short, the quality of this product leaves a lot to be desired."
5,"Grade ""A"" Entertainment","Author, Max Brand, uses the main character, Kitchin, to ""tell Kitchin's life's story"" -- and what a story he unwinds. Well developed characterization. Interesting and surprising twist to Kitchin's story. The novel is more about human nature, than a true western. Recommended read for any gender and age."
1,Weak and vague collection,"Soft, purient tales seeking to be odd and macabre but failing to generate any real friction or interest. The writing is lackluster with only a few shining moments amidst gallons of sludge. Don't waste your time."
5,a great debut from a skilled writer,"Edgy and irreverant, Mr. Berman is unafraid to cross boundaries with his debut title. Jumping from present-day middle America to New Orleans and then to a fenced-off magic zone, the author has a way with details that add resonance and depth to his characters. Each story is unique, yet several are interconnected in clever and highly satisfying ways. I would highly recommend this book!"
3,Two is a departure for Rob but some may dig it,"I have always been a lifelong Priest fan and of Halford's solo work and with Fight so i of course bought the Two album Voyeurs.I didnt really know what to expect out of it but it was very different with some decent tunes.""I Am A Pig"" stands out as does ""Water's Leaking"",i know Rob got a lot of flack for this one and its definitely not in any of my top albums of his but if u like his work give it a shot and make ur own decision.I am glad he stayed Metal though,rock on MetaL GoD!!!"
3,"not groundbreaking, but a good piece of work.","Bought it when it came out. I listened to it for about a week,saying to myself, ""this vocalist sounds familiar"". I was kind of surprised when i discovered that Priest frontman Rob Halford was singing. Not sure if he is just trying to cash in on a current music trend, or it this band is trying to make great music. This cd is good though. Lyrics have never been a strong point of Halford, But his voice more than makes up for poor lyrics. He likes to rock hard. that much has become obvious over the years, and this one is no exception. It is heavy , yet melody driven through the enire cd. Like I said before, not groundbreaking, but a solid album."
5,"Rough waters ahead, around, or behind you?","This could help! Helped me, at least. Of course, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who get it, and those who don't. If you don't understand this, consider yourself one of the latter.Godspeed!"
2,The Feast is on Early Priest,"With out a doubt, if you want the best Rob Halford and some of the greatest heavy metal vocals of all time, its not here.Pick-up the early Judas Priest recordings, ""Sad Wings of Destiny"", ""Stained Class"", ""Screaming for Vengence""...in that order of preference...but all are pure vocal classics.Im perfectly open to a Halford solo recording, but his vocal talent is not found here. This effort is not worthy of Halford. In fact, why not do an Industrial album...great idea, but does that mean you leave the trade-mark vocal genius behind? If it was classic Halford singing with range and dynamics over Industrial textures, that might have been cool and innovative."
2,Hot Rockin' it ain't,"Where is the spark that kicks the air? Where is the energy that charges everywhere??I am a fan of both Reznor and Halford. So I thought that, surely, there must be something in this disc for me to like. But while Reznor can work the industrial gloom and angst niche with flair and style and (I like to believe) at least a modicum of sincerity, Halford is entirley unsuited for it.For me, the best aspects of any Halford performance have always been raw energy and his impressive vocal range. Both of these are suppressed by the very nature of this music. I guess that you might be satisfied with it if you've never heard him hit the long, high note in Diamonds and Rust (Unleashed In The East). Rob Zombie could have maybe carried this off. Rob Halford could not.Despite everything I just said, I'm glad I bought this disc--if only for the fact that it represents one step on the journey from Priest to his current band, Halford."
3,"not my style, but unique","I have listened to halford for years. Two is a new sound; kind of techno, but different. They almost have a punk type of sound. I hardly listen to it: I put it on when I want something totally different as I prefer metal."
5,buy it now!,"WOW! Five stars isn't enough for this amazing song. The music alone is enough to sell it but when you had the heart breaking story and the incomperable voice of Linda Eder, whats not to love? I can't emphasize enough how much you will love this song. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it."
5,Great Brush Kit for many jobs,"This brush kit is great. I cleaned my car and the deck and the small shed out back. I even used a garden hose with the brush to clean the patio furniture. The soap can be put into the top of the brush head and you can use just a garden hose to clean. I did not have to use my pressure washer except when I did the top of the car. The center rotating bristle never stopped moving no matter how much I pushed down on the surface but I especially liked the fact you can adjust the soap dispenser in the top of the brush. The wheel well brush worked the same way except it has longer center bristles so I was able to get deep into the wheels. It comes with easy to use quick connectors so I could switch between the garden hose and the pressure washer real fast. Great idea to have the soap dispenser built into the head of the brush. All in all, great investment and I don't have to depend on the pressure washer to get the work done."
5,satisfaction,the dvd of wagon train was in good condition. I enjoyed watching it.I recomend it to any western fan.
5,Sure to gladden your heart.,"This is a quiet little Christmas story, subtle, a fable for adults and older children. I first purchased a copy 30 years ago and was delighted to see it was being re-released. I sent 17 copies to friends and sharing this little story was a highlight of the holiday for me.It has wonderful dense illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman, an illustrator of hundreds of books, and also a founder and frequent contributor to ""Cricket"", a quality magazine for children.The story tells of a lonely woman who is unexpectedly visited by an ""ugly child"" and how that experience slowly opens her heart. Who hasn't felt a bit grumpy, been cheered by a visit from a friend, or longed for the feeling of ""enough""? Really, you must read it!!"
2,I didn't like the main characters,"I've enjoyed Milk in My Coffee, Drive Me Crazy and even Genevieve for different reasons. The main characters in this book got really ugly. I listened to it on digital audio so it wasn't a matter of putting a book down. Dickey is a good storyteller, no doubt about that. I just did not care for these selfish people.I do, however, appreciate Dickey introducing me to the film, ""Code 46"" and the novel, ""The Alchemist""."
4,Good Read,"It is a page turner. I was worried about reading this book because IMO ""Genevieve"" was a terrible book with a good ending and was hoping that this was not going to be the same. To my luck it wasn't. This book was chock full of events. The title of the book was a play on words. It could be looked at literally as Keith chasing his daughter or the actual phrase ""Chasing Destiny"". It had a valuable lesson to it and I was very happy with the choice that Billy made at the end and was not burdened down with Keith and his problems.It was interesting seeing EJD write for a 15yr old girl. At times she seemed to be an 8yr old. EJD needs to leave the teenage lingo for the teenagers. I know that 15yr olds are young but he made her seem like a baby when she had conversations with her Dad. Overall, I was very impressed with the book. The span of the book was over a couple of days which I thought would annoy me but it didn't. I would definitely recommend the book."
4,EJD is out of his slump!!!!,"I tell you, I was a little hesitant to purchase this book. EJD'd last couple of novels have been sleepers (every one since Between Lovers). This book is a great read. EJD needs new editors... there are WAY too many typos. The reason for four stars is necause I think that even though the book was well written, there are some scenes that are a little too melodramatic... but overall, I say Welcome Back EJD!!! Looking forward to the next one."
2,Don't buy it!,"Well, I used FP98 and hoped that FP2000 would have gotten rid of a lot of the quirks the previous version had...NOT! Talk about frustration. I tried editing an HTML file in FP and it ended up scrambling my code. And when I tried to save the code the way I wanted it FP would automatically rearrange it. Plus, it would add it's own little HTML tags along with it.Another key issue was WYSINWYG (what you see is NOT what you get). You'd place text fields, buttons, etc. in certain places on the page and when you previewed the page they would be misaligned, off-centered, or whatever.I could go on forever on other quirks FP has, but I'll just leave it at that. Do yourself a favor and buy Metacreations' Dreamweaver."
2,Blah,"Microsoft just needs to stop. I bought this for my office at the request of my employer. Before I discovered Dreamweaver. It churns out too much proprietary code. As a result, if you later go back to edit a page with another WYSIWYG editor, things go kaplooey. Spend the money on Macromedia's Dreamweaver."
3,Good to learn with but mirror image of 97',"This is and always has been the best and easiest program to create websites. Its really easy to learn and publish websites. It cuts HTML completely out of the picture. But, when compared to the 97' version its a mirror image. Hardley any changes were made. If I were to do it all over again. I would buy the cheapest version. For the simple fact... Its cheaper."
2,Just an Okay Organizing Book,"I expected more from this book. I was looking for some great organizing tips, but there was nothing new in this book that I haven't read elsewhere before. Many of the tips (and the zen philosophy on being organized) could be found for free on the internet. If you're new to organizing or not very organized at all, this book may help you. If you're pretty organized to start with, you won't find anything special."
5,$6.95 Everywhere else!,"Great product! I just renewed the roof rack on my Honda Pilot! My Yamaha Cycle likes it too! However, it lists for $6.95 from most other sources."
3,doesn't last,"Looks great when applied, but leaves a film on your paint after a rain. Lasts better than others, but not as good as advertised. It may improve with multiple treatments, haven't got that far yet."
1,simply resistable,"I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies that I have seen in a very long time.Sarah Michelle Gellar is a bad chef/owner of her mother's restaurant until a little magic intercedes. Suddenly, she becomes a fabulous cook. Her little elcair puffs send people into fits of lust. When she kisses Sean Patrick Flannery, she floats to the ceiling.The plot in this book was very weak. Sarah Michelle Gellars acting job was tepid at best. I think that this movie had the potential to be fun, if the directors had decided to go the ""corny"" route.Don't waste your time on this."
4,simply irresistible,the ordered dvd came in before the estimated time and was in perfect order. I'm very pleased with the way it has been handeled.
2,thank god i watched this on cable...,"i waited for this to come on cable, and was glad i did! i am a fan of SMG, and i think she is a good actress, but why is she always in such bad movies? i know what u did last summer was probably the best one so far. this movie started off okay, but i kept thinking it must get better, and it doesn't! i did enjoy sarah and she had a great wardrobe and the soundtrack was good, but this film was just not as good a romance as i hoped it to be. it was so-so, not great. if you like very unrealistic romantic comedies, and SMG, you may like this."
2,NOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING!,"THIS FILM IS .......WEIRD.COMPLETE FANTASY.IT IS QUITE SWEET,AND SEAN PATRICK FLANNERY IS GORGEOUS!THE STORY IS ABOUT A CHEF(SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR)WHOSE RESTARAUNT IS GOING OUT OF BUISNESS,IS THERE A WAY TO SAVE IT......WELL THERE IS SINCE SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR STARTS SERVING FOOD WITH FEELINGS!WATCH IT IF YOU LIKE MAGIC AND FANTASY,BUT I WOULD RECCOMEND ""CHOCOLAT""IF YOU PREFER A BIT OF REALITY."
1,a total waste of time!,"I have viewed many videos in my day,but this movie is by far the WORST ever made.If i was sarah michelle Gellar I would be very ashamed of myself for making such a waste of money,time,and space.This movie flat out Sucks.The next time I watch this movie someone would have to pay me."
1,Resist the Irresistable,"Some clever ideas, but the script was too weak to properly convey the overall themes and plot points. Characters weren't very well developed. Elements were introduced and then never revisited or properly explained. The acting was weak from all involved, but I don't really blame the actors. The dialogue that was written for them must have been hard to take seriously. I also didn't really ever believe that Gellar and Flanery had any real chemistry. Fortunately, they don't spend a lot of time together in the movie.It could have been a cute little romantic comedy but instead was wasted potential."
5,Irresistibly Irresistible!,"""Simply Irresistible"" is a light-as-cream love story that stars the beautiful and talented Sarah Michelle Gellar as a suddenly good chef. She falls in love with Sean Patrick Flanery's character, and the wonderful magic begins. This film is so incredible. The story is trite, but one can hardly resist being drawn in and captivated by it. Watch it with the person you love."
4,Sweet & Easy,"LOVE the updated cover (not shown), it's cute & cupcake-y sweet just like the movie ;-)Easy to watch and relax to. Intices the senses in more than one way and who doesn't love a happy ending after a little toil & trouble.Happy to have this in my movie Go To box !"
2,Celtic Sea Salt,"I very much like Celtic salt, but I did not want the coarse grained. I ordered the fine grained salt and received coarse grained salt. I contacted the seller to no avail. I gave it a 2 star, because celtic salt is great, but I wouldn't buy from this seller again."
2,ummm...,"well, im sure the product amazing in itself but when i received it it was opened...the seal was broken but the top was secure...kind of a disappointment."
1,May Increase Blood Pressure,"Started using this salt. After 2 days I got this terrible headache. Check my blood pressure and HOLY COW!!! It's was the highest it had ever been.The only thing I changed in my eating habits was this salt.A word to those who may buy this Celtic Sea Salt, I'm not saying that it definitely will, but it MAY increase your blood pressure. So be advised."
1,garbage revisited,"This book is a perfect example of the attacks by the network of right wing zealots who have dedicated their lives to destroying Bill Clinton by innuendo, false testimony, and other slanderous devices. Interesting as evidence of the political paranoia eating away at our democratic institutions."
3,"Song is great, but the remixes?","There's a couple of really annoying remixes on here, even more than ""Independant Woman Part One"" remixes. If you love Debelah or think she's your role model than maybe buy this. But it's not too essential."
4,Decent,"A decent flashlight, but the white light button broke on me a few months in. I managed to fix it with a little super glue and such, but the little thing that actually pushes the button inside the rubber piece slipped."
4,Great light,"i got this just to have in case the power goes out in the house, and my wife took my first one i ordered. I ordered a second one, and i am just as happy with it as i am with the second one. the light has good construction, worked right out of the box, and is bright. it is not as bright as my EagleTac light or my Surefire light, but it is just great for what i have bought it for (Cheap have on hand light in case the power goes out so i don't bun up my surefire batteries). if you want an inexpensive light to have around i will surely recommend this to you. i didn't give it 5 stars because the first one i ordered had a red and blue switch and this one only the red. not a big deal to me. i don't know if it was a mess up with the company shipping them out or what happened. i would buy again, oh and i ordered on a Saturday and got it on Monday!"
2,"Great disc and hard to find in the stores, lousy shipping",Loved this disk since its' release in 93. Just never got around to buying it. Would've been nice if the shipping had taken the time it was supposed to. Took 3 extra days. I'd ordered this for a business trip and came within a day of not having it.
5,"Great Book, Great Story","The facts seemed pretty reasonable in this book to me and anyone can tell Lawson's father was Augustus by checking out Ancestry.com so not sure what that one reviewer was saying. It has been a while since I read it in the 1990's but the new book put out by the same author is even better and if you wonder about the facts, she put a lot of direct quotes in the new one. I wish I still had my old copy since they are now worth so much, but I did get the new book and I will definitely hold on to it and protect it this time. BTW evidently there will be less copies of the new one out there and it is way bigger and in a real pretty hard cover edition. It is called The Meaning of Our Tears and it's worth checking out the author's website. An incredible story and both books are a good read, but you can still get the new one at cover price and it has a bunch more in it."
3,Quality materials but awkward design for me,"I was really looking forward to trying these clippers after going through about 10 cheap clippers that required brute force to use.I have to admit that, after reading all the positive reviews, I'm fairly disappointed in these. Why? Well, first, they don't seem to be all that sharp. But that may be more perception than reality, because they do cut my nails well.But even more disappointing is that the opening is so narrow that I have to fumble around just to get my nails into the slot. I found a cheap pair of all-stainless steel clippers at the big-box superstore for about $3.00 that seem to do a better job."
3,Clipper,"Good, sharp clippers, but they don't open wide enough. It takes some maneuvering to get at your nails."
3,MIxed feelings on this clipper,I thought for the price it would be more handy. It is sturdy and sharp but my main criticism is that it does not open up as wide as I would like it to. It is sometimes difficult to get around my toe nails.Still not a bad product though
5,"Seems Like They Are All The Same, Except This One.","I've got a bad habit like most people and I bite my nails. One way to break that habit is to have a nail clipper handy when you get the urge to chomp away. Well, that is how I've been doing it :)These are very well made. Defiantly the best clippers I've ever seen or used. I'd recommend these to anyone who has finger nails."
4,"Seki, a winning clipper--","Excellent products, well-made, sharp. Only wish that the toenail clipper opened 1/16"" wider to acommodate two of my thicker toenails. Would then award Seki five stars."
3,"Works great, but too expensive","I've been using a $1 fingernail clipper for about 5 years now and purchased this clipper to replace it. I first noticed the size of this clipper is slightly larger than an average clipper, but the advantages include a sharper clip, slick handle turning mechanism, and the aesthetically pleasing design. A fantastic product overall, but quite pricey compared to a $1 clipper."
2,Could have been better - especially given the price,"I was in Stuttgart when I found a German nail clipper for sale in a gift shop. It was a shocking $29 but since I was on vacation and in a pretty good mood, I examined it and tested it in the shop. It did such a good job that I bought one. It remains to this day in my night stand, unshared with my family. Feeling a little guilty, when I saw the Seki clipper at a tempting price, I pounced. Alas, the quality is about as good as a $3 clipper I recently bought and no where near as good a give-away clipper I keep in the bathroom. There must be a better clipper out there and I'll keep looking. This isn't the dream clipper I hoped for.nail clipper"
5,Rolls-Royce of nail grooming,"The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a solid feeling fingernail clipper that provides a nice clean cut. A bit pricy compared to drug store clippers, but definitely worth it. This is one clipper that will not need to be replaced.I like to keep my clippers separate, but this fingernail clipper is more than adequate to act as a toenail clipper. The cuts are so clean I never needed to file in conjunction with my cut. However, if you like to file your clippings, you will need to invest in a separate file; a file is not built into this unit."
5,WOW!!,I bought this on Amazon for my husband and he loves this product.!! I then used the product and was amazed at the ease of the product. Give it a 5 star!!
3,Some good points but mostly a bit disappointing,"I purchased this because I wanted clippers with a longer cutting edge but they're actually no different than standard clippers. The quality of the metal and the size make them easier to handle, so that's a plus. But the thickness of the cutting edges and the standard size of the edge make no real improvement over the inexpensive clippers that you can get anywhere."
3,Definitely NOT worth the price,"Yes, it cuts the nails well.yes, it is stainless steel.But frankly speaking did not find it worth 14 us$.I did not return it as its too cumbersome and too small a product to return.I suggest do not waste money on this.Their are cheaper cutters which will do the same work for 1/3rd the price.Giving it 3 starts because it does the job BUT not worth the extra cost."
1,terrible service,i cant write this review about the actual nail clipper as i am sitting here 6 days after ordering and the product still has not been shipped. i would highly recommend not purchasing from this vendor!
3,"Sharp, yes, but . . . .","After all the hype, I was a little disappointed. They are sharp, but somehow hard to position correctly, and the angle of the clipper handle seems odd."
2,Not a great book for the real beginner,"Maybe this is a good book for people who have already learned Spanish. I don't think that it really starts at ""the beginning"". I'm afraid that I will have to look for a more basic text and return to this one at some later point. Absoultely no grammar, just moves straight into dialogues and exercies."
2,Hardly a complete course,"I bought BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE A COMPLETE COURSE FOR BEGINNERS and was rather disappointed when I found out that this is hardly a complete course.This is no more than an introduction to the language and not a very good one. The dialogues are very much the same as in any other language course, but the language explanations are too limited. You are left without enough information to make your own sentences adapting the dialogues to your own circumstances. The exercises have lots of pictures, almost like a book for children, but they are superficial, like the language explanations. At the end of the book the imperfect of verbs is explained with a scrolling line. Is this meant to be a joke?"
2,Useless w/o cassette,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Brazil. I also bought Pimsleur's Quick and Simple Brazilian Protuguese (audio CD's). While Sue Tyson-Ward's book contains lots of information, it should not be sold without the matching audio portion. I made the mistake of thinking Pimsleur's audio could act as a replacement, but it cannot. Until Amazon.com includes the audio complement to Ward's book, they shouldn't sell it."
