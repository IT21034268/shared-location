2,Not very durable,"The ball is nice and is pretty comfortable to play with, but not very durable. The synthetic got torn the first time itself. I thought it was genuine leather, but it's some soft synthetic material."
1,Totally Sucks. He can't possibly have any fans over 30.,Check out George Carlin little kids. That's a real comedian. Or if you have a bias against anyone whose popularity started before 1995 (when you were 5) Dave Chappelle and Nick DiPaolo. If you still like Dane Cook then you're officially retarded.
4,Funny Stuff Kids- september 12th 2003,"""Harmful If Swallowed"" by comdeic genious Dane Cook brings all the laughs to the table. Dane explains everyday life situations from his perspective. I certainly related to him in the way he acted and explain things that have gone on in his own life. Anyone, even a first time listener, who listens to this cd will have a good time, and laugh until your stomache renches with joy! I know the very first time I heard this album and watched his ""Comedy Central Presents"" special I was falling off a chair screaming with non stop laughter, and had tears in my eyes. It was such a good time. Dane has the ability to say things that may not be funny and make them funny. How Dane says things and reacts is like watching every emotion that we ever had come out all on stage. It is a heck of a good time, I reccomend this to anyone . Awesome!!!!"
5,freaking hilarious!,"Buy it, buy it, buy it!!!!! I listen to it every day when I'm in my car. It makes my day every day. Non-stop laughter!"
5,The Absolute Best Comedian Ever!!!,"Like the title states, he really is the funniest person you'll ever hear. I love stand-up comedy and own multiple comedy recordings, and this is hand's down the best one ever. Plus it comes with a full-length DVD with all of his bits performed on Comedy Central. His material is unlike that of any other comic and has the best delivery of any comedian EVER. He's so energetic and exciting to watch making him an even better entertainer.----------All Hail The Master, Dane Cook!-----------------------"
5,One of the funniest young comics around...,"I bought a previous release of this CD from Dane's website and I listen to it all the time. His act is high energy, animated and his style unique. Plus, unlike most of the young comics out there, it's not all sexual humor or swearing nearly every other word. Once you listen to the whole CD, you'll be hooked. I highly recommend this CD/DVD."
3,Not as funny as the hyped-up reviews say,"I've seen Dane Cook live and he was unbelievable funny and energetic. The performances in this CD/DVD set do little to capture that. A lot of energy, but not much comedy. Or at least not enough to justify the glowing reviews listed here for it. Dave Attell's ""Skanks for the Memories"" had me laughing for days, however. Check that one out!"
5,This DVD is awesome!,I've got all the Dane cook videos off Kazaa and still bought this DVD. It has all his comedy central apprarances on it UNCUT. Yes that means there's bonus footage (about 30 mins extra) that isn't seen on comedy central. The CD (which I previoiusly bought before it was available with the DVD) has an extra track that wasn't on the original. WELL worth the $$ especially considering you get both for what you usually get only one CD or DVD for.
2,"Commercial Rap, Or Hip Hop?","Honestly, after hearing 'Death Is Certain', this album doesn't even come close to how good that album was. There was more commercial, or should i say ""bubble gum"" rap in this album than any other he has made. It seems as if over the years, Royce has commercialized his music in a way, as to make it revolve around money, drugs, and bi*ches more than anything else. This is just my opinion. I only found a few songs on this album worth listening to...Royce should get his act together and go back to making real Hip Hop!!Edit"
3,Why Royce Why?,"This cd is alright. the lyrics are good, the beats are not half as good as any of his other albums. I was so disapointed when i went to get this album the first day it came out. For some reason a lot of the songs sound like fake lil jon beats. Royce is trying to follow the trend of other rappers. I would suggest getting this album if u like Sh@#ty lil jon cds. If not u might want to burn it. You should get his last album Death is Certain though, that has nice lyrics and beats"
4,Diagnosis Murder: Season One,"Diagnosis Murder: Season OneGood show, great actors (Dick Van Dyke), stories could be better written. Good thing, no really ""bloody"" scenes or anything entirely shocking. Just main character, Dr. Sloan, solving murders or other mysteries involving patients. Also like the interaction between Van Dyke and real-life son in show."
3,Brief bursts,Beneath the symphonic stereotypes and mystical metal meanderings the band is shown to occasionally possess the ability to not sound contrived and offer fresh takes on the genre.
5,Our most favorite baby-toddler CD,We have played this CD more than any other from age 6 months to currently 2 years old. It is also my favorite baby CD and I'm on the old side. I really like the lady singer on the CD. I wish I could find out who she is so I could buy other CDs of hers.
3,"If this is what you are looking for, you found it","These are definitely stories of more historical than literary interest. Jack Williamson is an amazing writer, but also an amazingly prolific writer, and let's face it, they can't all be gems. These were stories produced by the word for the pulps, and it shows. I will buy and read the other volumes in this beautifully produced series, but this one at least would make slow going for anyone not a dedicated fan of the author and/or the era."
5,David Maxwell Max Attack,"CD Max Attack by David MaxwellWas very pleased with this product. The CD is all that I thought it would be, it is a hard to findCD in my area, I knew I could find it on Amazon!!! The service from Amazon is always great, as are any of the products I have purchased."
5,Tugs at the heart strings!,"I first listened to this on vinyl back in the 80's, had a copy and then lost it, and am really happy to see it re released on CD. Amazon are getting my order today. This work gives life to all those amazing Brady and Gardiner pictures, it also gives soul to the history, sacrifice and drama. Real glad to have it back!!"
5,A fantastic album worth buying,"This is a cd that I have been waiting for since ""Stay Gone"" first hit radio and I have not been disappointed. ""Stay Gone"" is probably my favorite song on the album and was a great first single. Jimmy Wayne is an up and coming country artist who will most likely be around for years. His music is great."
4,Country Meets Soul,"I admit the first time I heard of Jimmy Wayne was someone talking about how hard he had it growing up. I was routing for him way before I heard his hit song ""STAY GONE."" Then I heard an interview with him on the radio on the day his CD came out and I was intrigued. I bought the CD on my way to work.Jimmy Wayne's music is like Soul and Country mingling together! What makes all of his songs even better is the fact that he wrote or cowrote a lot of them. Due to this you get a lot of feelings and emotions in his music. This music has a sad sort of mellow tone to it but don't take that as a bad thing. Wayne really pulls you in.My Favorite song on the CD is Just a Dream! His hit single Stay Gone is the opposite of a normal Country Music song. Usually you hear about someone wanting their partner back. Not here...Wayne says stay gone...Buy it! You won't regret it!"
5,Great Value,Ordered a brand new CD for a third the cost of buying it in a store. Shipped quickly with no damage to the CD. Couldn't be easier!
5,Robert Randolph is the next big deal,"The fiercest live band out there, Robert Randolph uses his studio time to make a studio-sounding album. If you want to know what the fuss is really all about, you better catch him live. As for Colorblind, the album combines the gospel church and the heaviest of metals. The artist is simply the next recipient of the crown. From Hendrix to SRV and now Robert Randolph, the title of ""baddest"" has a new bearer. Backed by Marcus on drums and Danyel on bass, arguably the best rhythm section in rock right now, and Jason on organ/fiddle, the band's true theme, love, shines brightly on this album. Contributions by Clapton, Dave Matthews and others complement the band's energy by adding familiar voices and sounds to entirely new ones."
3,Neusner's Translation,"Neusner's translation, given that it is the only one out there right now, will have to do for those who don't have facility in Rabbinic Hebrew. However, you have to be very careful if this is your only source for the Tosefta, for two very different reasons.First, Neusner and his students are notorious for their lack of emphasis on the precise meaning of words; sometimes they simply get it wrong.Second, there is a growing consensus that, at least in parallel material, the Tosefta preserves an chronologically earlier version of the text. Neusner's insistance that the Tosefta always be a commentary on the Mishnah can lead to distorted readings.That said, if you want the Tosefta and can't read Hebrew this is what you want.-Noah"
2,Aaah!,These stories are NOT what I would have chosen for my 2 year old! They all have something unnecessarily frightening or unpleasant. I skip those parts the best I can when I read it. Unfortunately my child really likes this book.
3,good,I had an older Conair model (cid500 i think) and am sad the preset radio stations disappeared. I like the phone handset having the pushbuttons - the old pne had the buttons on the unit.My needs are 1. Alarm clock - 2. corded phone - 3. good FM radio reception 4. earphone jack - 5. all in one unitGreat alarm (2 alarms) and nice to have the earphone jack so i dont disturb the wife. THe new system has digital tuning but uses a dial (ugh!) and the reception is just OK. I have a weak station that my mp3 player picks up at the same location. THe older unit had an external antennae wire and the 502 does not. I wish there was a better choice for a corded phone (so the phone is always there when it rings) with a good FM tuner. Anyone know of one? email me
2,I Got The Phone but...,"It arrived in a beat up box that was poorly taped. Cord connecting to phone jack was missing and the CD player was broken. And it looked worn as though someone had used it then sent it back for re-sale. The vendor said they'd refund the money because they didn't have any more in stock. Bummer! Well, got my money back for inconvenience but kept the phone as it had other features I wanted: the alarm clock, am/fm radio, caller ID. All work fine, got a phone cord from the $ Store later and programming phone was easy enough.Not a bad phone is it was new like I ordered and everything worked."
5,Extremely under-rated knife.,"This knife has served me well for 7 years... and not once was it used for its intended purpose. I bought this knife as an alternative to a standard electricians knife and it has seen a lot of use stripping heavy gauge wire as well as general cutting tasks found on any given construction site and some light carpentry. In all that time with a significant amount of metal on metal contact, the it has never chipped and never been too much of a hassle to sharpen.So, I can't really say that it can skin a deer, but should I find myself in that position, you can bet this is the knife that will be on my belt."
5,Saved my Astro Van,"Three years ago, I was driving my chevy Astro van, which had Slick 50 added to the oil, down the very bad dirt road to our remote cabin. I accidentally hit a rock and tore the oil pan off. I did not realize it, and continued driving nearly 3/4 of a mile to the cabin. At that point I noticed what had happened and shut off the engine. We had the van towed and the oil pan replaced.No damage to the engine, NONE.The van had run about 8 or 9 minutes with no oil in it at all. We still have the van and it runs just fine. So, yeah, I give it a 5 star rating.Also, in our part of Alaska, it gets cold, extremely cold. When starting a vehicle in extreme cold like this it always takes a few minutes to really get the oil flowing in the engine, despite the fact that everyone here has oil pan heaters. I feel that an engine that has been treated with Slick 50 does indeed get lubrication during these first few critical minutes. So we use it in all five or our vehicles."
3,Gave me a good sense of the Azusa St movement!,"I only recently heard about the Azusa Street revival in the early 1900s, a similar time to the great Welsh revival. Being drawn to learn as much about revivals as I can, I consumed Bartlemen's book. It provided a good overview with some tremendous insights into how the Spirit moved. The other interesting aspect was how strong Satan moved too at the same time trying to disrupt everything God was doing!A great introduction into the impact of this revival - gave me a thirst to read more...and one day to visit Azusa St.Worth a read!"
3,Bartleman's Azusa Street Revisited,"This particular book contains material from Frank Bartleman's origional piece written in 1925. However, some very poignant and necessary material has been edited from the origional piece. The origional has been out of print for decades but would serve to provide a more exact treatise as to the happenings of this early 20th century spiritual awakening."
2,Another gay film weakened by silly queens,"Well, what can one say? This mildly interesting film was so uneven. The good parts included the charming love affair - the two young men were genuinely attractive and nice people. There were some clever moments, such as the scene on the kerb between the lads and the older guy. Funny and well done. The usual caravansary of silly, loud queens - de rigueur in most gay themed films - came and went. The film worked best went they went. Their silly overacting and endless squeaks as tedious as usual. The dreadful non stop pop-crap music track was a definite downer and had litle to do with the drama. The fast forward button got over some of the dull bits. I almost gave up on the film untill the relationship got underway. Things improved from there."
3,don't look like the image page,"Tha adidas predator that I liked was white, the adidas that I received was red. Anyway, thanks for send me the t-shirt so fast."
4,Good Little System,"I am pleased with the sound and the features of this little stereo. I didn't expect to be blown away when I chose this unit, and I wasn't, but it has performed very well, everything works just fine and it gets a lot of use every day. I don't know why the CD didn't work for the other reviewer, but this one is working great."
4,Good-Sounding Budget CD,"I am very happy with this CD, though I'm sure I'd feel differently if I already owned the 2-CD Return To Paradise from which these songs were taken. The sound quality is terrific for a low-budget collection and the performances are top notch -- Dennis and Tommy are both in excellent voice throughout. There are only ten songs but they are all keepers (Crystal Ball and Suite Madame Blue are missed somewhat, but thankfully there's no Mr. Roboto!!), and the CD still clocks in at close to an hour. Definitely recommended for those who don't already have Return To Paradise."
2,Better Rifftrax DVDs Out There,"Like other reviewers before me, I had an issue with the sound on this particular DVD. This is the first ever MST3K or Rifftrax product where I had such an issue. The Best of Rifftrax Shorts Volume 1 is great. So is Shorts-tacular Shorts-stravaganza. No problems with quality, and tons of laughs. But in addition to the poor quality of the sound on this DVD, many of the featured shorts were just too weird to be funny. Better than Swing Parade, but still pretty bad. Definitely shop around and pay attention to other reviewers when looking at Rifftrax stuff. It appears to be hit and miss with their products."
4,Hats Off !!!!,"Eric has with out doubt captured the intimacy of a best selling novel by allowing the reader to engage their imagination, keeping my experience with the characters private, yet providing the graphic imagery of a feature film through his concise abilities as a verbalist.Being a visual and performing artist, I appreciate the way Eric uses words as a scenic backdrop to heighten the tragedy and passion. You will be consumed by the urgency of the novel and may walk away with a few grey hairs, but in a strange way will experience a since of relief by Burn's tragic ending. Hats Off to Eric. OTRA, OTRA!"
2,20/20 Hindsight Through Rose Coloured Glasses,"I remembered this album with the fondness of rosie memories of good times past. However, I must confess I was disappointed with the quality of this new cd release. If this is a remastered original; the original must have been in bad shape... in my opinion. The sound quality is tinny in many of the cuts ... but maybe it always was and in ""those halycon days"" I had not noticed. The only track I play with any regularity is ""She wrote me a letter."" . Sorry Leon, but I do still luv ya...just not this CD"
4,"oscurecido por las nubes de alcohol, atravesado por la desprolijidad, el perro loco sigue aullando.....!","cualquier atisbo de sensatez que uno podria esperar queda desfigurado desde el primer surco.....actitud circense, promiscuidad de versiones, vejacion al legado beatle, exageracion y crudeza en estereo, esta grabacion te deja el laser alcoholizado!!!!!!!!! dificilmente se pueda hallar tanta locura, ingenuidad, salvajismo y arrogancia en un recital de casi cuarenta años atras....... despues de todo, el rocknroll NO ES ESO?????????????"
1,Hype/no results,"So far this product is a bust, not worth taking, Plan on letting Dr OZ know as well, bought this product because of his show"
1,"NG, worked 3 times and now its DOA","Got this to heat a 6 gallon Hydraulic fluid reservoir on my Ford Tractor.The metal base I applied it to is over 1/4"" thick.Work great the 1st two times I used it for about 2 hrs both times.3rd time I used it worked OK, today NADA."
4,Incomplete but a Nice Intro to Jeffreys,"Garland Jeffreys is one of those unfortunate talents who never saw many of vinyl records make it to CD. This compilation album provides a decent but incomplete introduction to a great singer-songwriter. With vocals that sometimes sound like Jagger, sometimes like Elvis Costello, this guy is a super songsmith with a distinct sound. If you still have a turntable and can find his other LPs - Ghostwriter and Garland Jeffreys being the best - buy them. His combination of urban grit, hopeful romanticism, and catchy lyrics should not be missed."
2,Algo aburrido,"La verdad es que no me gusto este libro, a pesar de que creo que Vargas Llosa es uno de los mejores escritores del mundo. Tal vez si yo fuera dominicano o si supiera mas de la historia de ese pais me hubiera gustado mas."
4,Crystallography for non-crystallographers,"This book covers every aspect of structure determination using X-ray crystallography techniques. Using small molecules and macromolecules as examples, this book is for a wide audience in academic and industrial research. A summary and a glossary is present at the end of each chapter making it easy for a non-expert to understand the crystallographic jargon."
1,half great watch,"First, let me say that I love the design of this watch. I have owned versions of this Timex for years. This most recent purchase, however, has been somewhat disappointing. Within a month of the purchase the digital portion of the watch stopped working. At least I assume it was the digital portion of the watch - in fact I can't get the indiglo to work either. None of the buttons work. The analog portion is fine - the analog watch keeps time very well. I'm not sure what to do at this point, though. I'm considering returning it."
4,still works,"i bought this timex expedition cuz i thot it looked sporty. and it does. has both analog and digital so its handy. but the digital part is not easy to control with the buttons, not for me at least, but once set, its cool. the band sort of wears out, but the core is still good. nice watch on the whole."
1,Incomprehensible Instructions,"I've written two books on computers and the Web and personally taught more than 10,000 people how to use computers. I could *not* decipher the inscrutable instruction sheet that came with this watch. Before you buy this watch (or any Timex!) go to the Timex website and read the PDF version of the watch's instruction sheet. I'm sticking with Casio from now on."
3,cleveland pride,"i think that Avant could've done a little bit better on this album. his single led you to believe that the cd was going to be this 5 star love cd. however, there are a lot of fast cuts on there, along with a few r&b rap songs. Avant is from my hometown Cleveland so i cannot dis him. however, i think he should slow it down a little more on his upcoming albums for the fans."
2,"AVANT-Keith Sweat's Retarded, Pretty Boy Reincarnation","Working with Steve Huff has its great point like SEPARATED, MY FIRST LOVE, and NOTHING IN THIS WORLD (With Ketara Wyatt), but that's it.My sister bought the album. Typically, she's the type of person that will give Avant some record sales. He is retardly cute (leave on the glasses bruh) and he can sing. Most guys can be the not-so-cute type of guys, but if they can sing, they will get some play. Avant is truly in that definition.Steve Huff clearly doesn't fit with Avant, because from listening to most of the slow songs on the album, he don't need to be working with him. The only song that I can prop Avant for is SUICIDE. Steve Huff did do great on that with him.Avant needs to find his niche, he will never find it with Steve Huff.Don't waste your money. Record SUICIDE, MAKIN' LOVE, MY FIRST LOVE, NOTHING IN THIS WORLD (With Ketara Wyatt), and SEPARATED and call it a day."
2,So-so effort,"I must admit that I rushed out and bought this CD because of its first single, ""Makin' Good Love."" I absolutely fell in love with this songs. After several listens to the CD, only a couple of songs struck me as any good. These were ""Don't Say No, Just Say Yes"" (I fell in love with this song, too) and ""Love School."" A couple songs on the CD are torture to listen to. There is one song in particular (I don't know what track number it is) that sounds so close to an R. Kelly reject song that it is scary. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this CD."
2,Not very interesting,"Written in a very straightforward, boring way. A fair amount of filler. For example, in the section on Subway Stations, one of the items they point out is the ""Ticket hall: Passengers buy tickets or tokens from staffed offices or from vending machines."" Not very informative...Any of the David Macaulay books would be much more interesting."
3,Works good but smells bad.,"This would be an awesome visor organizer except the material smells like smokey car tires and is still noticeable after being in my car for over a month. It makes everything I put in it smell the same. Serves it's purpose as a visor organizer, though."
5,Visor,"this visor is well made, compact, with places for everything you need. Love the sun glasses pocket. I would highly recommend to everyone."
5,Headphone and Adapter at Best Price,The product arrived on time and in the expected condition. I have had this product before but it was lost and I needed to replace it. This is the best traditional headphone I have been able to find for my LG VX9400!
5,LG Handfree Stereo Headset great deal,Can't understand why anyone would pay upwards from $30 to get one of these elsewhere. Sound is great and it functions the same as it's identical but more expensive counterparts. Doesn't come with foam pads though...it's only minor drawback.
3,"Affordable, Acceptable product for the price.","Verizon charges close to $30. for theirs, so if you get an immediate short in the cord with theirs, then this is a acceptable product for the price- It works- not quite as well, but you can afford to have it break. It has already lasted longer than the ""orginial"" equipt., and at the rate it's going, may well outlast the phone bought as a Christmas present- which is now defunct after 5 months.... Everythings' relative!"
2,bad design for the headset,- short cord- ear pieces are small that they fall from the ear.- sound quality is bad.
5,GREAT Pan!,"This pan works very well. I made brownies in it for Christmas and just sprinkled powdered sugar on them for a very easy, great-looking holiday treat. NordicWare is always good quality. I especially like a pan I bought from another retailer that is like this one but 12 mini bundts. I just used that one for cornbread muffins and they came out perfect with no washing of the pan required afterward. Stay away from cheap pans and buy NordicWare when you can. That's what I say."
5,Best Soundtrack!!!,"This is the most amazing soundtrack I've ever listened to. The more subtle tracks are so beautiful! If you're thinking about buying this soundtrack it is definitely worth it! Believe me I'm being completely honest. I know some of you say "" well that's your taste so I'm unsure "" But I'm telling you this soundtrack is excellent! Klaus Badelt is a brilliant composer!"
2,Lacks the coolest song,"I bought the CD because I loved the trailer song, which most of my friends agree is one of the coolest trailer songs ever. Well, guess what song is NOT in the CD? Yes, the trailer song.I still haven't figured it out if it's because of some copyright issue, an error, or plain stupidity, but the fact is that the song that most people like when watching the movie, is precisely the one that is not included.To be fair, the rest of the songs are quite good, and that's why I didn't give the CD one star. But since those songs were not the reason why I purchased it, I still feel it is at the very best deceiving."
4,The Time Machine OST,"Well put together soundtrack, like it more than I liked the movie. The more traditional music towards the beginning is nothing out of the ordinary, but the more ethnically inclined music towards the end is awesome."
2,One flavor was rancid.,"I ordered this as a gift for someone. 5 of the teas smelled OK, but one of them smelled rancid, like oils gone bad. Adagio does not provide a telephone number for customer service. Everything is by e-mail so I wrote. They did not respond so I wrote AGAIN. I finally did get a response which was: nobody else has complained. I don't feel this is a decent answer. They should have opened up the bin of tea in question and taken a whiff for themselves. I feel that would have been a more appropriate response."
4,Good historical reference,"I read this book about 25 years ago. If you can get over the 1930's style hyperbole, which is the colloquial language at the time, it really is a good historical reference of the beginnings of the Philippine Constabulary and an insight into the Philippine history.It graphically depicts the struggle of the early years of the American occupation of the Philippines."
2,Lame,This book was very lame and overly idealized. The one benefit is that it is short and does give some information on Six Sigma/Lean methodologies.
5,Christmas Story China,"Excellent choice for a 'fun' dessert plate...for a luncheon or a dinner. Also is a great collectible item for gifts for children. The china is flawless; the story, of course, is timeless."
4,Good old book,"I learned logic from this book, and so I am very fond of it. As a presentation of what was known at that time, it cannot be beaten. The only problem with it is that a lot more has been discovered, so a modern treatment of the subject is better for the beginner who wants to be properly informed. For this I suggest the books by Copi or even Kleene. But if you don't care about modernity, or have an interest in the way things used to be done, I strongly recommend this book. Also, I might mention that Hilbert's ""Geometry and the Imagination"" is good even for the modern mathematician."
3,King sized comforter is smaller than advertised,"Nice lightweight comforter, nice combination of fabrics for a rich look without being very expensive, but the king sized comforter is actually 102""x86"" not the advertised 102""x90"" in the description and seems a little short on the sides, definitely too small for brand new mattress sets that have not settled. In order to cover sheets underneath...the sheets need to be tucked in tightly and the comforter needs to be smoothed out completely....a little more effort than I care to put in to making my bed. With moderate effort it does look nice, but until my mattress set settles, I will not 'LOVE' how it looks in my bedroom."
1,Not only not advanced-not beginner either,If advanced means more than I know with only 2-1/2 years with Sql then this is not an advanced book. It is mostly puzzles and things like that-not anything really useful in the real world. The worst part of it is all the errors in the code. There must be dozens of these-but where is the errata?I have a lot of comp. books and this one has more beginner mistakes and typoes than any others I have read. Not advanced and not beginner-not sure who is supposed to read it.
1,Laughably bad,"The book is horrible. From the first page to the last, there's no end to the nonsense. Who cares about Itzik's martial arts instructor? Who cares about whether he met someone with the same name? And the examples...sheesh! Most are either too simple to be really useful (lots of fantasy world scenarios) or get off into things no one cares about. The book was a complete waste of money and I'm returning it!"
1,Worst investment I've made in awhile,"I'm still trying to figure out what is ""advanced"" about this book.The writing is poor -- very poor, in fact. It's loaded with run-on sentences, bad grammar, and copious typos (I counted one on every page for no less than 12 pages!)Many of the examples don't work, and the ones that do are too simple to be useful.The coverage of SQL Server 2000 is sporadic and incomplete.My problem is that I can't come up with any redeeming qualities for the book. I feel like I really wasted my money on this one."
1,Not worth the money,"There is really nothing in this book that you can't get from other sources, most especially the Books Online. There is also nothing remotely advanced about it. I'd say its beginner level at best. I have decided to return my copy for a refund which is a first for me."
1,Pretty pathetic excuse for an advanced book,"Whatever caused these guys to think they had an advanced book here? This is strictly a beginner's book, and a poor one at that. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the prose is fairly horrible and definitely indicates a problem with English as a language. More importantly, though, is the fact that there's little here that isn't also in the BOL (Books Online) that come with SQL Server. I was also put off by how weak the SQL 2000 coverage is. There are a good number of new features/functions/etc. in SQL 2000's Transact-SQL that aren't in this book. If you're going to regurgitate the vendor's online docs, the least you could do is do a complete job of it!"
1,returned mine yesterday,"Worst hodgepodge of a book I ever read. Probably has an error on every page and some silly commentary on every other. Authors don't know transact-sql or how to write. If you want to learn transact-sql, get a different book - this one ain't gonna get you there."
2,"Not a bad book, just not very advanced","It's not that this book is very bad, it's just that it doesn't live up to its title. Frankly, I think the real problem here is that Henderson's Guru's Guide book has redefined the word ""advanced."" His book is _advanced_ - really advanced. So much so that, if you're a complete beginner, you may struggle with it. From that standpoint, this book pales in comparison and is not really advanced. Now, that doesn't mean it's a bad book, it's just that it's not as advanced as people have come to expect - not a good thing when you call yourself ""advanced."""
3,Too predictable,I find that most of these books are so similiar that I know what is going to happen before it does.
4,Loved it,"This book was well written. Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors. I could not put it down , she makes romance novels SEXY!"
1,So disappointed =(,"I had a Fantom vacuum in the past and LOVED it! Considering this one is a Fantom and a ""commercial"" one, I thought I could'nt go wrong. Boy was I mistaken! Although this is a 12 AMP, you'd never know it. It hardly has any suction power at all. You have to clean (per the instructions and from experience) the filters and bagless canister after every use. I vacuum my floors every single day. So they aren't overly dirty and this becomes a nuissance. I find myself going back and forth over the same area's because it doesn't pick up noticable dirt (lint, dog hair, food crumbs, etc...) and this is such a huge waste of time - and money. I put this vacuum away and have drug out my old Electrolux I had tucked away from the 70's until I get another. It does a much better job. Don't waste your money on this vacuum ... no matter how good the price may be."
3,"Good vaccume, bad handle!","I have 6 kids and vaccume usually 2 times a day and thought this vaccume would be worth it. Within the first two weeks a weld in the handle broke and now I have to bend over and hold the handle to use the vaccume. The vaccume isn't valanced well, and usually when using the hose attachment the vaccume itself tends to fall over. So you are juggling with holding up the vaccume unit and using the hose to clean what you wanted. I will say the suction is really good on this machine and once you over look the handling problems of it that it does work well."
2,DENON is over rated...,This is one of the first 1080p upconversion dvd players. Nowadays for the price you can get a better one for 1/3 of the price.
1,not happy with DVD,"This dvd cost $25.00 and the movie is only 31 min. long it cut all the good parts,and skip alot of important parts, you can tell when it is skipping a part the blinks like it is going to commercial and is not worth the money, thr company should have how long a movie is on the details for the movie.The only good thing about this is that I called the company and informed them that I am not happy about paying 25.00 for a movie that is not even 30mins long and they are going to let me return the movie and credit my card backThe Boy King (Short Version) (Home Use Version)"
3,Too Short,"I ordered this DVD because I remember when I was younger, this use to come on TV every year around MLK's birthday, and I wanted my children to see it. I was so happy to find it on here, but when it arrived, sadly it was too short.(about 30 min. long)Most of the movie is missing. I'm not sure where I can find the full length movie, but if anybody knows can you please post? Other than that, the movie is great."
5,Franco at a higher level,Its very hard to obtain very good Franco albums with high sound quality. This album features many of his best numbers from the mid-70s and is produced with clear sound and correctly remastered. I've noticed wild fluctuations in the prices asked for Franco et le Tout Puissant OK Jazz cds lately as private sellers start to squeeze the market for these fairly rare items. It would be helpful if Amazon tried to bring some order to this marketplace. Its unreasonable and really unnecessary to tell customers that they have to wait 3-5 weeks for Amazon to get a response to a general ask about a specific cd. While we notice that the private sellers have jacked up their asking prices two or three times Amazon's price.
1,Great content bad finish,"The video content is great James Bonnet's presentation is full of helpfull tips and very well structured speech, nonetheless the DVD case and overall packaging is the worse ever, if you are charging close to 30$ for this at least make sure the cover has a good print on it. at the end is the product image, this is packaged so bad that I dont wont to have it on my bookshelf. net being the content so good I do believe it deserve better packaging."
3,A good introduction and overview of the book 'Stealing Fire from the Gods',"I expect the impact of this DVD will be different for different people. In short, it's a great overview of the detailed content in Bonnet's book 'Stealing Fire from the Gods', but it's really just an introduction to the whole theory; which means it may even function as a good introduction to mythic storytelling theory in general.The DVD is a great taste of the countless insights in Bonnet's book, which I highly recommend."
1,Very poor design,Suction cups do not hold to windshield even with no weight in the mounting bracket. The poorly designed top part of the holder broke off almost immediately. I was very dissatisfied with the quality and performance of the product.
4,A good introduction for the would-be amateur stone mason,"An excellent introduction for anyone who is interested in learning more about stone work and masonry.I enjoyed the book for the breadth of coverage, and for the anecdotal stories. It is one thing to be told safety tips and procedures, but the lesson is much more effective with a good story. I had hoped for a more comprehensive discussion of the tools used, how to use them, and how to shape the stone. However, lack of this does not detract from the usefulness of the book. The closest I have come to stonework was moving stones around for landscaping, but now if I were armed with a set of stonework tools, I would be tempted to try something more complex."
4,"Good book, lack few important points","This book is great. The only thing that the author miss is the flowing of all the movements at a slow, even and inpausible pace. The author concentrates on 'song', relaxation awareness, this is vital but he miss pointing out that tai chi is actually an art of constant change and not taught by the numbers. Furthermore Grand Master Cheng Man Ching's 37 step form takes about 9 and 12 minutes preferbably. All these reference is taken from Nigel Sutton's, Tai Chi Chuan: Roots and Branches."
2,"Boring, predictable, unbelievable","I'm a huge Hogan fan but found this title to be a huge disappointment. Maybe I'm burned out on Hogan but I could almost predict what was going to happen next in the story. Free thinking scientist is the hero, evil goverment/corporate scientist is the villian. Totally wild ideas are introduced, the Earth orbiting Saturn during the dinosaur age and thus reducing the Earth's gravity? A proto planet just barely scraping Earth in orbit? I know James is in contact with many scientist buddies which makes his books believable but I think he needs someone to tutor him on orbital mechanics, the ideas here are a joke. Oh well maybe I'll go back and read some of his classics again."
4,Great sunglasses for outdoors ! (skiing etc...),"Previously had Wiley X B-2 sunglasses and loved them. 3 sets of lenses, lenses were easy to change......but i lost my lenses and needed to buy new sunglasses.Bought XL-1 with adjusting lenses. Several things you might need to know before you purchase these....1. I was VERY surprised to see that my XL-1s are made in Italy (at least thats what it says)2. Light Adjusting Lenses (or Photochromic lenses) DO NOT work indoor or inside a car. Lenses are not sensitive to light, but to UV rays from sun (windows indoors or in car block UV rays). LA lenses are for outdoors only and they work pretty good (not great)3. Lenses are not that easy to change like in my Wiley X B-2s4. Sunglasses are pricey and I would not pay over $100 for them. (look for deals. I missed a deal on ebay for $65 and ended up paying $97 from a store.5. Quality is good and overall I am satisfied. I cant wait to test them in real skiing conditions."

5,interesting,"This book discusses a wide variety of halachic queries that rabbis had to answer in the ghettos and concentration camps. Some of these queries directly involved matters of life and death (e.g. should a Jew bribe his or her way out of the camps if another Jew will be substituted?), while many others involved ways of fulfilling more routine ritual duties in trying circumstances. Where common sense answers were possible, the rabbis profiled generally applied common sense. Of course, in some life and death situations, rabbis had much more difficulty. This book discusses both types of situations."
4,I love my new watch,It's just so nice and solid and clean. I like looking at it. I like wearing it. It keeps accurate time. And I am addicted to the Indiglo backlight feature.
4,Great price,Serves well and well made. Use it on a 5KW space heater and it's up to the task without getting warm.
1,Don't Buy --- May Go Bad,"My parents purchased a 256MB SanDisk SD Card for Christmas as a gift for me at a retail store (not Amazon). It worked really well in my Palm Zire 31 for a while, until the card went currupt. My dad went to SanDisk's website and found in the FAQ's that the 256MB SD Cards have a history of going bad. I wouldn't take the risk if I were you, because you may loose your pictures, music, documents or whatever else you would store on an SD Card. Go for a different brand if you want a 256MB Card."
5,No problems for me.,"Reading the previous reviews, one might be led to believe that SanDisk makes shoddy products. My experience has been quite the opposite. My Kodak camera came with a 32 MB SanDisk SD card, and we bought a 128MB SanDisk card to go along with it. Then when prices came down a bit, we went for the SanDisk 256MB. We have had ZERO problems with any of these cards. I use the 128 MB with my PNY card reader to shuttle photos, mp3s, etc, among my 3 computers; no problems whatsoever. I would not hesitate to buy more SD cards from SanDisk."
1,Crash and Burn,"I should have known based on the various rants about this card in various forums. After working well in my Dell Axim for several months, tonight the card became corrupted and cannot be formatted. (I lost several pictures I just downloaded from my camera.)Buy at your own risk. If it works great, fine. If it doesn't, you have been warned (like I was before I purchased this card)."
1,2 died on me taking with it dozens of pictures I took,"I already owned two of these. First one died destroying all the pictures that were on it. The store replaced it for free. Then the replacement one died. Wish i just asked for my money back and have gotten panasonic sd, or even lexar. SanDisk is a terrible company, no joke. How hard is it to make these things work?"
1,Became unreadable,"One minute it worked, the next it didn't . . . same thing happened to a friend of mine's. Both cards were under a year old. Neither my camera, multi-card reader or my computer would recognize it. Fortunately, I'd copied the all photos on it to my computer just before it died!"
2,This book doesn't deliver what the title promises,"I was a bit sceptic before reading this book but thought I would give it a try. The main problem with it, in my opinion, is that it does not really tell you ""how to"", it just tells you what you should do. And the things that you are supposed to do are not few! I was looking for some short-cuts, but that was apparently not the idea of the author. The language style is very advertising-like, with most sentences being short imperatives almost like commercial, pseudo-philosophical slogans.What I liked best about the book was the section on stress-free entertainment. Ms Walter suggests to cook the day before the guests arrive, and provides recipies as examples. Those look tempting."
3,Diverting,"Cheap animation, But of the Rocky Bullwinkle type of humor - English style.Amusing to watch, but not too many in a row."
5,Sea of emotion...,"This album explains everything about life,love and human being.Lyrics are very deep and effectual. I bought this album three months ago then i notice that,every song has different story and different emotion,especially ""Little Wing"".Because of this song,i become a huge fan of Jimi Hendrix. In the end,this album is very emotional and must have,you will live this one."
4,Sting's Best Album (Sans The Police),"Eight of the twelve tracks are fantastic, and only one is noticeably bad. The Lazarus Heart, Be Still my Beating Heart, and if it weren't for the chorus, Straight to my Heart, stand among Sting's best works. His sultry rendition of Little Wing is astounding; I've never before or after heard Sting's voice sound so good and the strangely haunting, yet fitting guitar work make the notes palpable. However, the CD's sound quality unfortunately suffers from a purely digital recording in what was still CD's embryonic stage. But despite the sheer-miss that is We'll be Together, the superfluous, The Secret Marriage (at the very least it should've come before Little Wing, and not tried to follow it) and the completely misplaced Rock Steady, the remaining tracks range from damn fine to masterful, and as a work that stands as a tribute and a memorial to the worst loss a son ever and, inevitably, will face, the album is an exquisite achievement."
3,sixes and sevens? More like twos and threes,"OK so it's not that bad. It's just not good. Tristania's Beyod the Veil is much better. This album just didn't do it for me. Seriously, all the songs sound too similar to hear any major differences between the songs. Also, this album is why people these days think that goths are melodramatic."
2,Hormel Tamaes,"This [peoduct is disappointimg, being fond of Mexican spicy fopds avaiable n restaurents all over I thought it would be nice to have similar items n my pantry. Unfortunately these Tamales are so bland as to be almost taseless, requiring the adition of much spice and some jalapenas to make them satisfyimg."
3,great for little kids... not great for anyone who's not,Material is repeated over and over again. If your already familure with investing you probably should keep searching for another book.
5,"This is the ""Best of the Bible"" for kids.",This title provides kids with the best stories of the bible. It also has questions at the end of each page to consider. Good Devotional to do with your kids. This is a must have if you like to read to your kids
5,The Wall: Live in Berlin,"If you Floyd lovers like this great CD, than you will have an even greater time watching the concert on the ""Live at the Wall"" DVD. And those that are new to Pink Floyd or this CD and DVD, you will absolutely enjoy the experience. Long live ""rock and roll""!!!!!"
3,WRONG MILLS BROTHERS MASTER (INCOMPLETE),Once again I bought a CD hoping to get the hit rendtion of the Mills Brothers GET A JOB. It seems that all CDs with this song have used an incomplete stereo master without the lead vocal. The 45 of this song which hit the charts has the very same vocal lead as the original recording by the Silhouettes.Will someone please get this right!!!! It is totally frustrating to have to go back to the 45 rpm disc to hear the correct version.
2,I Love You Too,"""I Love You"" by the Climax Blues Band is the only reason to get this cd. [""When I was a younger man I hadn't a care . . .""] CBB was a two-hit-wonder. Other than that, they couldn't get it right. The compilers of this cd could have done a much better job of era and genre matching. Hey, I like Pat Boone, but what is he doing on a compilation cd with this 1981 hit? And who ever heard of these other songs?"
2,Changed the ingredients?,"I had ordered this seasoning from Amazon before and it was good as always. When that ran out, I ordered more, but this batch tastes way too strongly of thyme, I think it is. Jane's Krazy Salt used to have an even mix of flavors with no one taste standing out. Now I have twelve containers of seasoning I don't care for. Now, if I want thyme in a dish, I could use a judiciously small amount for that purpose. I wish that if they were going to change the formula, they would say so. The containers do say ""original"" on the label."
5,Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt,Have used this salt for many many years and everyone just loves it. Also put it in gift baskets for friends and family. If you haven't yet............do try it.
1,Worthless,"Simply junk. If you value your time don't buy this product.It does not work with Win 2000 at all, well, maybe if you have a whole day to tinker around with a $30.00 piece of junk.I am returning it right now."
3,"Excellent output quality, very noisy input","As another reveiwer has mentioned, the line-in is extremely noisy and is basically unusable. Sound quality on the outputs (line-out and headphone) was excellent though. Sadly mine too is going to be returned and I'm going to try the Audigy NX instead."
2,Unexpected descriprion,"When I look around description for this sound card I was happy with knowledge that this card is supported for 5.1 setting. But when I opened this box I found that this card really supported for 2.1 only. For 5.1 I have to have an optic cable. This option was not required in the outside of the box description and was a surprise for me. I thinking, don't need to play with customer, 5.1 setting ready for optic the description shall be present on the top of the stuff. I looked for specific details online and didn't found nothing. This is why I returned this card and purchased a different, where I have a true 5.1 setting."
2,Not great.,"The otology section of this book is relatively thorough, however the plastic surgery section is a joke. Would look to other sources to study for inservice exams and board exams."
3,ENT resident,Some topics (e.g. ear and sinus) were well-covered but others included only very basic information. There are also some errors in this text.
1,Us conservatives are yawning already...,"If you are the type of person who likes to harrass people for their values, include emotionally abusing terms of language in your sarcastic, one-sided speech, and literally HATE and LOATHE people who do not agree with your values, then this is the book for you.It was not the book for me, and I hope that you concur. Reading this woman's columns in the paper alone is sickening enough. Imagine a full book of her hateful words against people who are not really evil and awful, like she implies.If you took out any words that were sarcastic, she would be rendered unable to communicate. Please, do not waste your money on this book when you can decide for YOURSELF what your values are, and not be enforced by an awful example such as the scrap of rubbish that she wrote."
3,missing a track!,"i specifically bought this cd for the song grow old with you which is listed here, just received the cd and it ends at track 13! the grow old with you song is not on it! i am going to return it and very disappointed on this deception."
1,Not good at all,"I bought this product to lower my engine noise but didnt work at all. I felt no difference with the before and after installation. I went to an audio shop to measure DBs before and after without getting any actual changes. To anyone ears, the sound came as loud as before.I also had to uninstall it because the mat keeps the engine hot. A big waste of my money and my time."
4,Good book,"I like this book and explains a lot about the secrets of man. First time I read it, it was on the internet and it really opened my eyes. had to get a hardcopy and this copy is nice."
5,Interesting subject matter,It's a subject I have long been interested in and have been unable to get the book where I live.
4,lost book of Enki,"with all the shows on TV lately about prophescies & aliens, I found this book very interesting.It arrived when promised. I have sent this on for others to read."
5,Best stunt kite I've ever owned!,"Absolutely superb performance. The response is great - even in light winds. Everything is included to fly right out of the box within 1 minute. I am so glad I bought this kite. The price is reasonable and the entertainment is remarkable. Very fast and very powerful. My only regret is not spending a few more dollars and getting the Prism Sylus P.3 (bigger brother) instead. If I had any idea of how much fun I would have with this kite, a bigger one would have made me smile even more. Either one you choose - YOU WILL LOVE!!!"
4,Good writing and straightforward opinions....,"however, I don't think I share his taste in poetry. He dismisses many well-known poets because of the anemic state of literature today. Although I agree with him about the current stagnation in poetry, I don't think I will dive into the alternatives that he suggests."
4,Very detailed in particular aspects...,"Uh, a very detailed under garment section, with the rest of the book lacking slightly. There are pages of different versions of bras and underwear, but no help on drawing actual skirts, no step by step guides, just a picture that you observe and copy from. It was alright, definately helpful, just not extremely helpful."
4,How To Draw Manga Volume 4: Dressing Your Characters in Casual Wear (How to Draw Manga,while i did order the cheepest used one the slip on cover was torn. tape fixed that right up. i found no other problems with this highly informative book and an injoying it thourghly
5,Roomy--tons of pockets,"This bag was used for a week in an area where I needed plenty of pack space and the ability to attach other items to the external pack. There are a ton of external and internal pockets, so in theory, you had a home for each important item. There are so many pockets I lost items inside the bag. Not the bags fault, but mine. Lots of room for extra clothing, supplies and a 100oz camelback inside the back pad. There are Tabs, attachments and a Molly system that lets you afix whatever you may need. The pack is comfortable, user friendly and comes in an assortment of colors. There is a decent UTube video on the pack that will give you a better idea whether to buy or not.I highly recommend this pack if you need the extra space."
5,norm from canada,"Hi,Have this for sale? If you do, I will provide details how to reach me. Just response via the review. I will be watchong."
3,Imperfect Reception,"Works as advertised for the most part... I have the device where the stereo it controls was, and it will occasionally miss a signal that would have been picked up. Somewhat of a minor annoyance since we use a programmable remote. If you can put up with that, it does transmit as advertised."
2,Very easy to puncture,"Anything with a squeaker is our dog's idea of a good time. After ""borrowing"" squeaky tennis balls from the dogs at the dog park, we decided to purchase a few for our 20 lb schnauzer mix, Smokey. We already have a few Kong products & are impressed with their durability so opted to buy this brand over others.The good news: The ball was a hit & the perfect size for him to carry & squeak. The bad news: The first ball was punctured in less than 3 minutes. I actually thought the first ball may have been faulty because he went through it so quickly. Nope, within 10 minutes, all 3 balls were punctured & out of commission.Our Smokey is a chewer, but these were punctured with him just squeaking the ball in his mouth -- and not very long might I add! I'd think any dog would have the same experience -- chewer or not."
2,squeaker pops out in 5 min,My 7 lb. pom loves these balls. The balls hold up quite well but the squeaker doesn't last more than just a few min. I wish I could find another brand where the squeaker would stay in the toy for more than 5-10 min. I just keep buying more balls as my extra-large breed dog loves these as well. He will chew on them like gum. Great entertainment for the dogs.
3,Disappointed that it's not made in the USA,"My dog loves these tennis balls, especially cause they squeak. But, I was very disappointed to learn that they are made in China, and not the USA like the description states. So, I've had to look into alternates, but NO ONE else makes a squeaky tennis ball that's also made in the USA. Very disappointed. :("
4,love the squeak,"My dog will only chase this ball, if it does not squeak he will not chase after it.Yours will too"
4,Better than others,I have an 86lb dog and the regular tennis balls he brakes in half within 10 minutes and these ones last months. I have a couple dogs so I buy small to large :)
2,Not the usual Kong quality,"Simply put, these don't last like most other Kong items. 30 lb. beagle shreds them in less than 5 minutes."
2,Kong tennis balls,My dog loves her tennis balls so much that she will lay down with them in her mouth. This causes them to get very wet and soggy. I have found that the dye they use on the felt stains the carpet when it becomes wet and my dog leaves the ball on the floor. I suppose these would be good for outdoor play but for indoors I prefer to just buy regular tennis balls.
3,Not for strong chewers,"My dog loved these balls. I got both the smaller and the medium for her, for variety. She is a 35 lb Lab mix 8 month old chocolate Lab mix. I had to watch her like a hawk with these. Once the outside yellow fabric got frayed, my dog started working on it until she pulled the entire yellow covering off of the ball. Then she proceeded to chew the exposed rubber ball to bits. I still use these balls to play fetch, but as soon as she stops running with it and sits down to chew, I take it from her."
4,Perfect size for little dogs! Even the larger Kong balls are fine for her too.,My little girl is OCD when it comes to squeak toys and is hellbent on making the squeak cease and then destroying the squeaker noisemaker mechanism itself regardless if its a doll or if its a ball. She doesn't discriminate. These balls last a month or more if she doesn't kill the squeaker or pull off all of the fuzz on the ball. She tends to go for the fuzz on the larger balls which I had gotten locally. During Christmas I got lazy and ordered stuff here and found these small ones. I was stoked and now so is my little one. She loves the smaller balls. I busted one out after Christmas and although I can't find the ball to vouch I don't think it squeaks anymore but she hasn't tried to make this ball bald. I expect turnover with these balls and may pooch so everything is cool and these balls and other squeaker toys are great. Can you start making the new squeak toys out of kevlar?
2,They seem ok; all three Danes hated them,The squeek was sharp and seemed to bother the dogs. No amount of coaxing could get them to play with them. They did not work for us.
3,"Great fun, not long lasting","My little 5 pound Chihuahua loves these mini balls. I've purchased countless toys for him and I think these are probably his favorite. He absolutely loves chewing them and getting the squeaks. Unfortunately, just after a few hours of use, he managed to kill the squeaker in two out of the three balls. The balls are fully intact. Just no more squeaking. I'll probably look elsewhere for something that is a bit more robust in build quality."
1,These are junk!,We have a small 30lb lab mix. She did in all three balls in about an hour. They did not hold up at all. The little squeakers popped out and that was the end of it. In addition the squeakers are a choking hazard. I would stay away from these.
3,"Love em, just wish it was more durable","My dogs love these, (a Shepherd, a Dobie, and a Beagle) but the balls die really fast. I've gone through a lot of them. I'll continue to get them, even though they do die fast, usually the balls don't even last a week.I don't let my dogs use them as chew toys, just fetch toys. They love the squeaker sound the balls make and enjoy these over regular tennis balls. However, they easily destroy the squeaker. Its a small plastic piece near the surface which the dogs teeth will eventually push in and then no more squeak; then its just a regular tennis ball. This seems like something that could easily be redesigned, Kong..As an alternative, I've used the JW rubber squeaker ball, the squeaker does last longer, but the JW ball is heavier than these light Kong tennis ball."
3,A rather dry account of one of the world's best mountaineers,"Free Spirit could have, potentially, been a incredible account of a brilliant mountaineering career. Instead, during the course of the book, one can picture Messner sitting down 20 years later in an attempt to remember exactly how he felt during his numerous expeditions and bold first ascents.Although the book starts out well enough with fond memories of his childhood in the Dolomites, it quickly degrades into a fact-fest of unemotional paragraphs that will disappoint. How anyone can describe their first ascent of Everest without oxygen, or the death of a brother in so few words is amazing; if not degrading.Your climbing collection will not miss this volume."
3,Reads like a rapid overview,"Messner's account of the early years of a remarkable climbing career skips over each individual ascent so quickly that the reader loses interest. While his writing in itself is not unskilled, the rapid descriptions make the book read like a laundry list. Also, while his puritanical philosophy of mountaineering must have its roots in this early period, he mentions its development only in passing. Despite some gorgeous photographs, this book does not approach the best of its kind."
1,If only I could give this a negative star!,"I bought this book b/c it looked promising, and didn't bother to read any reviews on it.The story, while a little far fetched, could plausibly happen... But after 3 promising chapters, I lost hope. This book kept going on and on about the heroine being a ""know-it-all"" in regards to survival which grated my nerves. Yes, we get the point that she scares of men with her natural attitude. And the hero, OMG! could he be any more of an idiot? The coconut scene sealed the deal for me. Meanwhile his co-producer, Gwen, does a complete 180 on the heroine-she's acting like a gal pal on the phone and suddenly she's on the island acting like a b***h. This book is definitely headed to the used book store. Don't waste your money or your time!"
2,WARNING! NOT FOR STUDENTS ALREADY ENROLLED IN COLLEGE!,"You might think that this is a guide for students already in college, but beware. Though it has some good advice, it is supposed to be written for high school students wanting to major in drama, dance, or music in college.A second warning: This book is dated, five year-old material."
1,Lock broke,"About a month after I bought the lock, it broke. The lock became stuck and just would not close anymore."
3,OK for a gym locker,"Made in China from aluminum. Aluminum has the notoriety of being the lightest and softest of metals, making it rather unappealing for making a lock. It's also 3x larger than I had expected, making it too big for a luggage lock. Seems somewhat easy to pick as well - probably just enough security for a gym locker but I wouldn't use it for much else."
2,Sturdy. Elegant. Ridiculously easy to crack.,"Got these to be able to get control of my set of tools at work. Combination lock allows me to give out access without having to hand over a key. This is good enough for that job.However, in general combination locks are usually very poor at real security, and this one is no exception. This lock is very easy to crack with the ""usual method"": I can open this thing behind my back in about 20 seconds. If you really need a combination lock, get one of those rotary dial ones."
1,Buyer beware,"I was skeptical of other reviews that claimed how difficult it was to set, but it's actually true. Not worth the hassle in any way. My lock wound up in the trash since it locked on who knows what combination."
5,Solid Lock,Got this to use at the gymIt is very easy to program your personal combination and easy to use.It is a bit bigger than the tiny ones that people use so I feel it has a bit more strength as well.The numbers are easy the turn and you can enter your combo one handed if you wanted to.I would buy this again if I needed another lock like this or lost my current one.
5,Superb Master Lock,I had not seen this product in the usual stores and wanted a strong combo lock at a reasonable price. I bought 4 of these and they are superb; up to Master's usual high quality and not overly expensive. This is not a light weight padlock. It is substantial and with 4 number selection will provide excellent security.
1,Easy to break into,"These locks are jokes. I can get into one in about 30 seconds to a minute. All u have to do is pull on the shackle, listen closely as you turn each dial, When it's on the right one it clicks loud. Mine wasn't just a fluke either because I've tested this with several. If you want a reasonably safe lock, skip this. All most as easy as a TSA Aproved key lock."
1,avoid,"Easily broken, garbage, avoid or you may have to go through the hassle of replacing your stolen valuables. Another American company that has lost its values. At least if they're going to keep costs low by producing easily broken locks they should provide insurance."
2,cheap product,what started off as a good deal ended up being a mistake.within 2 weeks there were only three pins left. good luck making a connection!
1,GalacticLongWinded,"I thought this book was tedious and that the author could have organized his thoughts better. He begins to tell you something, stops and says he'll tell you more about that in some other chapter. Occasionally the book starts to get interesting and then he flits to conjecture and hypothisis. I have read a lot of books on ancient history and thought he should do more research. I really thought his writing style made what I consider a fascinating topic very boring. I was transformed unconscious...zzzz!"
1,What are you looking for??,"The book has scientific value, but distorts findings to make conclusions. If you are searching to fulfill yourself spiritually, this is not a book for you. You can make peace with your God, whichever religion, by simply listening to your soul...However, if you love pseudo-fiction sci-fi, eat this book up - its a buffet!"
4,A classic that never dies,"This series started and ended before I was born but over the years I was able to catch a few of the episodes, mostly I was able to watch Kung-Fu, the Legend Continues which was good but I'm happy that I am now able to get all three seasons and watch all of the classic episodes whenever I want."
5,Exactly as expected,This is the original series. I got it so I could go back and watch them in the original order. Fun!
2,Enjoyable with reservations,"I enjoyed this show when it first aired and was looking forward to buying it. I read one of the reviews which criticized the show for categorizing all whites as evil. I have to say that after watching it I find that true. It is almost comical how the white characters are portrayed as ignorant, barbaric racist. People of color and Asians are almost always portrayed as smart, sensitive, and loving victims of some evil, perpetrated by those evil whites. I guess they went out of their way to reverse discrimination. It seems over the top but consider the times.I think most people wish the lead went to Bruce Lee who was supposed to get it. Little did they know who would become the superstar.Enjoy it for what it is, a fun piece of nostalgia."
5,Not just Kung Fu,A great series with great plots ( if you look into the story line )Loved the narration comments by David Carradine
3,Not bad but poor quality built,This item is inexpensive for its design and functionality. I like it except that I found some defect in the area where keyboard panel and the aluminum cover weren't glued tightly enough so they are loose. I have to be careful so the keyboard panel won't come off when I open the aluminum case.
5,A definitive collection of Carpenters immortal classics,There has never been any duo as great as this brother-sister team and it all reflects on the harmony that they've created....they will forever be one of the pioneers of pop music....
4,Great show,I think this is a great show. I love the animation style. The only thing I wish was that it was a full season and in widescreen. The opening credits are obvious the show is made in widescreen format but for some reason they crop it fullscreen.
4,Another flawed masterwork,"Rarely have better stream-of-consciousness psychedelic recordings stood the test of time like Can's intensely organic approach. Though they specialized in a sort of cosmic noodling, fusing together scarcely grouped elements with unconscious elegance, almost all apparent flux comes layered with knowing musical intuitions, breaking away from many counterparts who tried, and failed, harder."
3,OK but just that,"These are good for light work. I use it for an acoustic guitar with an under-saddle pickup. But the cable is a little on the light side so I hesitate using it outside with the band. It is a good practice cable for my basement setup but now that I own it, I don't think I'd take it on the road with me, so to speak."
5,Fantastic price for such a great product,"I bought this for my brother who plays a five string Fender Jass Bass. And the 20ft length allows him more freedom to move around when he's performing. The sound quality that this cable gives an instrument is phenominal especially for the economical price; there is less static and you can hear the higher tones without it sounding choppy or muffled. With this patch chord, his bass sounds a lot fuller and cleaner; it's perfect for stage performances because he doesn't have to be beside the amp the whole time. He's had this for over three months now, and used it in three concerts and once every week for Church choir practice and it still sounds perfect. I would recomend this product believing that this is the greatest quality cable you can get for the price that it is."
4,A working cable...,Nothing special... It works well enough and seems to be sturdy enough for a home studio... Might not hold up so well in a live environment...
5,Guitar Cable,"what can I say,.. it's a guitar cable. I can turn my amp up to 11 and have all the signal from guitar to amp I need.sometimes I have pedals in between to help hide me nasty strumming.1984 strat standard, in some awful yellow colour. I call her Blondie!"
5,"Excellent Quality, Great sound","Absolutely no complaints about these cables. We use them to power two Fender Squier Strats, and were very happy with the sound quality for our use. The plugs are sturdy with injection molded guides/covers and provide good strain relief. For the price there's no worry about solder quality, since any repair would cost you more in time than a new cable.We also use the more expensive metal cover Hosa Cables and see no appreciable difference in sound quality.Great for short connections for mixers or straight to the amp.Specs - 10', 1/4"" mono (tip)"
4,No problem Cables!,"Use these for my Schecter BlackJack V1 ""V"" type guitar and they work as they should with never a problem."
2,Avoid: malfunctioned after a couple of months,"I purchased this for my son's bass setup. After a couple of months I noticed that there were a lot of buzzing noises coming from his room. Initially I thought it was something to do with the active pickup system on the bass, or the socket -- but we were able to trace it to the cable. I've had a lot of cables over the years and very few of them failed in this way (i.e., short/poor connection). I will buy a better one next time.p.s. Amazon: I went to return this and got ""return window expired"" -- but isn't electronic equipment failure covered within one year by statutory law? Well, this is so cheap -- as well as nasty -- I can't be bothered. Disappointing on both counts."
1,Awful product,"I have owned two of these in the past year and both have broken within months of using them. They start by cutting out and making a loud, annoying buzzing sound and then soon after, don't work at all. Planet Waves needs to go back to the drawing board."
1,Only Good For A Gas Stove,I owned this saute pan until I finally had enough and gave it away. This pot works great on a gas stove but not on an stove with electric burners. It left cold spots and when I pushed the food aside to add another ingredient the food would cool down.I am a middle aged cook and luckily don't have wrist problems but I the handle does feels like I am holding a hot dog. It isn't useful for oven cooking unless you cover the handle. Sorry Rachael a cookware designer you are not. Stick with the cooking and leave designing to people who know how.
1,Cheap garbage Not cheap price!!,Buyer beware!! Don't bother buying this. Terrible quality. If you bought one at a local dollar store you would be better off and a lot easier on your wallet.
3,"Great Music, Awful Mix","When I put the headphones on, I tried to imagine watching the band, just as I did in Santa Barbara at the Earl Warren Showgrounds (The Leaves opened the show!), stinking of cattle ka-ka. James Newton Howard, the film composer, 16 at the time, might have been nearby. He later helped David Lee Roth cover ""Coconut Grove"" by playing all the instruments.After the CD got rolling, all I could visualize was Cattle Ka-Ka. Here are some of the best pop/folk songs ever written, but mixed and mastered onto plastic by some cowpoke with a branding iron.. .Rhino should have listened to this first. What they have done to Zally and John's music is criminal, and far out-bludgeons the kind of treatment the Beatles early recordings got from Capitol USA.I haven't ever been so upset about the quality of a recording.Go elsewhere, people, but don't abandon the Spoonful in the process - it's not their fault !"
3,Faberge Encyclopedia,This book has a small section of small photos that are not very good quality. All of the 47 known to exist Imperial Eggs are not shown. If you are looking for photos of the Faberge Eggs look elsewhere. If you are looking for 263 pages of print information this is it.
5,Excellent,"As always, Sternberg discusses his topic in a way that readers can understand. His inclusion of the assessment of thinking styles helps to clarify reasons individuals may look at the world differently. This is a must for leadership classes."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed when I saw that this knife was Imported by Buck from China.Out of the box the blade is sharp enough to shave the hair off the back of my hand with a little drag. The action was stiff, heavy and not very smooth. Opening the knife, the first time, the thumb stud left a dimple in my thumb. Closing the knife, one handed, is a little difficult due to the heaviness of the side lock spring action.Overall the knife seems to be a fair value for what it is but it will not be replacing my daily carry knifes.Imported from ChinaBlade thickness: 0.095""Side panel thickness: 0.097""Overall thickness: 0.335""Overall thickness at clip: 0.503""Width at widest point when close: 0.982""Overall length when closed: 3.730""Thumb stud diameter: 0.197"""
3,Decent Shoulder Holster,"I've worn this with my Walther PPK from time to time. It's not as uncomfortable as some people make shoulder holsters out to be. The one thing I do not like is that there is no second, lower connection across the back between the two should loops. There is only the one strap linking them at the top. So, this moves around a little, and you'll feel the urge to make adjustments all day long. If there was a second strap linking the shoulder loops on the mid/lower region of your back, along with that top strap, this would be much more comfortable."
5,I love pine hollow!,"This Pine Hollow book is one of the best. I havn't read any further than this because I can't find any more, but I'm going to order them soon. The AJ thing was getting so frusterating, I was glad to find out the truth. I found it a bit surprising when Veronica draged the truth out of him, and as for the way she hangs on to scott - GAG! I know some people feel the same way about Alex and Lisa, but I know people like that in real life so... Carole's obsession with Samson is screaming trouble, she's forgotten all about Starlight. I think Ben should say something too her about it. and as for stevie's brothers giving her a hard time about teasing Michal, he deserves it!"
3,Who designed this thing?,"It took some getting used to and a little ribbing from my friends and co-workers but I'm finally ""okay"" with this little case for my compact printer.The word ""metrosexual"" immediately came to mind when I first saw the design. Seriously, what guy would choose faux croc skin over, say, canvas or a durable nylon. The case looks more like one of those free gifts with a $100.00 make-up purchase. Apparently HP thinks only women buy their portable printers and therefore design them like handbags. It holds the printer securely but I would have liked to see more pockets or compartments available. Next time let a man design this thing."
2,"No battery, but nice case.","I had this on my Christmas list and was very specific that DH order this one BECAUSE of the included rechargable battery. Well, as with the other reviewer, there is no battery included. I haven't contacted Amazon YET, but I plan to. This is blatant false advertising - and I have been watching this item for MONTHS.It is a nice case though and I look forward to taking my printer on the go-go with it."
3,Good but pricey,"I bought a similar item for my friend. He liked it a lot. the only problem was that it a shade too small for him. but he is still using it al the same. For the price I got it for, I expected a good size but I cant complain. it is fair to buy."
2,Adams Live Circa 1988,"Live in Europe, Adams' set includes all his hits up to 1988(""Cuts Like A Knife"" ""Summer of 69"" etc.) Adams is an engaging live performer, but like most live sets this one is for fans only. It makes for a nice keepsake for the fan that wants to have an audio memory of an Adams' concert, but it doesn't quite capture the energy and charisma of Adams on tour."
3,Beware of Shipping Charge,"The product itself was great and works a lot better than the factory installed batteries. However, Eek Technology charged me about $20 of shipping cost from New Mexico to Arizona, for just standard shipping. They had their batteries listed the cheapest but they seem to drastically raise the price on shipping and handling."
2,More like a salve than a moisturizer,"I love the Indigo Wild company and the fact that their products are all natural. I've been trying a lot of them and most of them are great! This product, however, rates lower. It smells wonderful, but it has the consistency of a medical salve and goes on greasy. The greasy feel lasts longer than most 'natural' type products (like natural grape-seed oil or jojoba oil) and when the greasy feel is gone, so is the moisturizing effect of the product. My skin actually felt dryer after using this product than before. But it can be salvaged if you want a nice perfume. I dab a bit here an there and I smell wonderful! I won't purchase this product again."
3,The Stuff America is made of,"The book unfolds the picture of an extraordinary American family, the stuff of which your country is made. Even more than Jack and Connie's participation in the MRA story, it is their background, their kind of patriotism, their love of people that fascinates us as Europeans. I want to thank Florence in particular, for her postscript. What she says about the limitations of the content of truth in the writing of history and biography goes for all of us who had a go at writing. And that we should be slow to judge people we read about and rather be grateful when they share with us what means most to them in their lives. Hope the book will be read by many and that you will soon have to reprint for the next edition."
4,LET THERE BE LIGHT,THIS MINI LANTERN DOES THE JOB NICE BRIGHT LIGHT AND THE BATTERY'S LAST VERY LONG WHAT ELSE IS THERE BUT GOOD PERFORMANCE BEST IN AREAS AROUND 5 TO SIX FEET I LIKE IT
4,Satisfied,"The quality the materials is really good. I was expecting to be a little bit more brighter, but it's OK."
1,Drains Batteries,"I have had two of these for about two years. I have found that when I need to use them, the batteries have been drained and are dead. Since I don't use emegency lights except in an emergency (power outage) I am very disappointed in these laterns.They are ""cute,"" but essentialy unreliable."
5,Exceptionally Well Written,"I ussually keep opinions to myself of what I read and what helps me the most, every book has a different spin on technology. This spin however, I liked a lot. I think this book is well written and has a lot to offer. I currently work on a 22 server farm, and we need to cluster a set of servers. We also have mandatory orders to upgrade to 2003. I thought this book would be perfect as it covers both aspects which are the upgrade from 2000 to 2003 as well as learning how to cluster and load balance both 2000 and 2003. There is also a section that shows how to upgrade a 2000 cluster. Since we are starting from scratch, this book helped us to completely plan our deployment. Now, we just need to act on the plan. If you are looking to cluster or load balance 2000 or 2003, then this is your book. For good clustering info on just 2000, I used the Windows 2000 Clustering and Load Balancing Handbook by Joe Lamb. The two of these books were all I needed."
5,Awesome series!,"I ordered this DVD set looking for a step by step guide to learning Krav Maga. The series is easily broken into upper body combatives, lower body, grappling, and weapon defenses. The material is simple, functional, and easy to learn. I would recommend this very highly to anyone looking for a good fighting system in an easy to learn format."
5,Authentic Krav Maga Instruction - Worth Every Penny,"If you are looking for authentic and intuitive Krav Maga instruction, this DVD series is for you.I have trained in Krav for the past 2 years. This DVD has not only corrected various flaws in my technique, it has taught me a significant amount of new material as well.David Kahn's superior knowledge and skill, coupled with his engaging and informative teaching style make this DVD a must have for anyone interested in learning practical self defense techniques.With 6 DVD's and over 6 hours of material covering upper and lower body combatives and defenses, takedowns, control holds, clinches, choke and grab releases, groundfighting, multiple opponents, and Retzev (Continuous Combat Motion), this DVD series provides a solid baseline of knowledge to defend against a variety of attacks.Clearly I strongly recommend this product. It is truly worth every penny."
2,Nowhere Near The Quality Of Drive Or High Mileage,"Who wrote the songs on this one? Weird Al Yankovick? ""If French Fries Were Fat Free?""? ""U.S.A. Today""? Really? Maybe he's been spending too much time drinking with Mr. Buffet and this is having a negative impact on his song-writing.My advice to people is to hear this album first before you go out and spend money on it. If you don't have Jackson's ""Drive"" or ""High Mileage"", get these albums first. ""Under The Influence"" is a good album worth buying if you like really traditional country.This one merits 2 stars for the pretty good track ""To Do What I Do"""
1,An album not worthy of his great career,"Its been a great couple of years for Alan Jackson, Drive was Brillant, he was nominated for many CMa's and he had a smah duet with Jimmy Buffett.So when his new album was released, I was thrilled, that feeling didn't last to long. There is more to music than just walking into a studio and singing there should be a process, it seems he did no work at all into this album.If your a fan, maybe try some of his early stuff, because this is not worth the money."
2,Breaks easily,"The bad: I've broken two of these already (with a Garmin GPSMAP 60Csx, but I doubt that matters)...not by any harsh use, but just by bending over. They are not very sturdy. They break in exactly the same way, the track cracks just above where the button sits. Once this happens, the GPS can pop out easily without you even knowing it. They really should be made stronger.The good: They work great (until they break). Very quick to attach/detach GPS.I'm considering ordering a Carabiner Button Clip (Garmin 010-10481-00) as an alternative, but I have not tried that product."
4,"My Second One! Works Okay, but be careful!","This is my second belt clip. When I purchased my Garmin 60CSX about a year ago I read reviews about the belt clip being fragile. I used the clip for several months without any problems. This fall I was at a Phillies playoff game going up steps and the GPS caught a railing tearing it off my belt and breaking the belt clip. Had I not had the lanyard looped around my belt the GPS would have dropped 3 stories. My advice is when using the belt clip, always secure the lanyard to something on your clothing or belt."
2,Poor Packaging,"It is kind of hard to mess up on a splitter and, in fact, the splitter was probably fine but I ordered a 3-way splitter which the packaging did indicate but it contained a 2-way splitter. Somebody goofed."
3,Ok splitter,"The first splitter arrived defective as one of the three outputs didn't work at all and you could hear something rattling inside. Return was very simple through Amazon's policy. Second splitter arrived with another slight rattle but still works ok. Image quality is reduced even with only one output connected but I'm ok with that since this is only for a secondary hook-up. Overall, it's an ok splitter especially for the price."
1,Not good!,"After installing this splitter I had problems with my TV(HDTV)reception. I ended up having my cable company come for a service call. The splitter was the culprit, not allowing good signal through... this was, in fairness, an ""inexpensive"" splitter and I should have known better. But for installations where quality signal matters such as with HDTV I would not recommend this splitter."
4,Can't wait to read the sequel!,"I was fortunate enough to be in England in November, so I got to pick up copies of both ""The Potato Factory"" and ""Tommo and Hawk."" I'm trying to understand why the USA has been so slow to catch on to Courtenay. Obviously ""The Power of One"" was quite a success, and, IMHO, the greatest read ever. I felt ""The Potato Factory"" was slow to start, but was fascinating once the characters started leaving for Tasmania. It took until then to really enjoy, empathize with, understand, and like or hate the characters. The end was definitely meant to force us into reading the sequel, unlike the more subtle entry into the sequel ""Tandia."" Since I love Courtenay's writing, I have no problem with an obvious ploy to get me to buy another book. I have general comment about most of Courtenay's books. Has anyone noticed the horrible editing, especially on ""April Fool's Day""? Just an observation."
5,Couldn't stop reading this.,"I enjoy history, especially realistic. This book leads up to the characters being sent to Australia. It can be difficult to stomach some of the treatment of the poor lower class. The next book in the trilogy is even more graphic and hard to imagine the things done to children by today's standards. A good read and thought provoking."
2,"Decent, but lots of bloated code listings","This book is okay, it's just not great. Some of the code is educational, most of it isn't. The author has some strange coding techniques and formatting choices that I normally wouldn't recommend,but I guess that's his choice. All in all, this is just an average or slightly below average book."
1,Too Academic,"This book is too academic to much use today. In fact, this probably was a dissertation before a full manuscript. However, the parts about the ""Muldergate"" scandal are interesting and shed light onto some of the actions of the apartheid government in the 1970s."
3,"Just okay, but may be best option","My 6 year old likes this ATM and has fun knowing how much money he has in it. I searched this type of product online and not many of them had good reviews. So maybe this is the best there is for a kids' toy.Be warned, however, that it doesn't hold a LOT of money (in coins, anyway.) The money is all stored behind that rectangular door at the bottom which is only about half as deep as the machine itself. When you get very many coins in there, the next time you open the door to make a ""withdrawal"" (you open the door, take some out, then type in the amount of you removed), they all come spilling out before you can shut the door again. It would be great if the money was sorted somehow or dropped into a place that would not fall out.Also, this machine does not count $2 bills.It's fun, but not very impressive."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Bought a total of 6 all junk...within 20 uses the machines stop opening, the doors fall off etc. i ended up just building a wooden box ...do not waste money on this or any other piggy bank from this manufacture."
1,Bought two for Christmas and neither worked :(,"I bought two of these (one for each of my daughters) and neither worked. One did nothing when the ATM card was inserted, the other took the ATM card but I could not even set the current data and time in it. It seemed like the keypad was defective.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT!"
2,disappointed,"this bank is VERY loud, it does not count money accurately and when you open the door, the money all falls out."
4,This book + Transcender = PASS,"This book was very easy to read and gives most of the important details needed for the exam. Since it does not include example questions, I used transcender exam questions as a supplement. When I first took the transcender tests after reading the book I knew enough to BARELY pass if the transcender had been the real exam. After doing transcender over and over until I scored 100% then taking the real exam, I passed with a 900/1000 (766 required to pass)."
1,What a flop,"This was such a disappointment. It read like a Lifetime movie of the week, only not even as good. The premise of a group of middle-aged women spontaneously leaving home and walking had promise, but the characters were never developed well. It fell into a ""poor me"" sympathy-fest, where all men are inconsiderate dolts, and only women can ""understand"" anything important or meaningful. I also felt like the author was trying to push lesbianism as the solution to all their problems.Don't waste your money or your time, I'm afraid."
1,Skip it.,"This is one of those books that makes me feel BETRAYED! I found it on a ""staff recommendation"" table. I liked the cover, liked the premise, liked that the story took place in Wisconsin . . . It seemed to have all the ingredients for a book I might enjoy. Except for one BIG thing. The writing is awful. I'd like to comment that I didn't have a problem with the large cast of characters and think the author did a fairly good job defining them with brief but telling characteristics in the opening chapter; however, that's the only thing I can praise about the writing. Will someone please tell me how garbage like this not only gets into print, but gets positive reviews, impressive publicity and ends up on a staff recommendation table?Because of this book, I have made a personal vow to no longer buy ANY book before checking the reviews of ""real"" readers on Amazon.com. Had I visited this listing first, I would have saved myself eleven bucks. Geez."
1,OH! So disappointing,"I rarely give up on a book but after plodding thru the first third I had to move on to something else. It sounded interesting and I had high hopes when it was chosen for book club but it just had no life to it. I couldn't seem to care about any of the women in the story and that goes against everything this book is supposed to be about. If you must try it, get it from the libary!"
1,I have changed my rating,"I disliked this book so much that I felt I had to write something. In retrospect, my first review was too generous. I gave it two stars on the merit of the idea of the book. Having rethought things, I decided I didn't even like the idea. Picture this story turned around... make it 8 men who get together once a week to gripe and drink too much wine. Then picture these men just up and walking away from their wives and kids... and jobs. Do you think the nation would rise up to salute them? Do you think the sheriff would be praised for sending a cruiser to protect them?! The idea is totally ridiculous. So WHY is it so glorious for these women to do this? Why is their lot so much more painful than a man's? This book simply FELT juvenile, whiny, and pathetic Therefore I decided I had to change my ranking. (I didn't even finish the last two chapters.... I simply couldn't go on"
5,I couldn't put it down...,"Several years ago, I read ""Dancing Naked At The Edge of Dawn."" At the time, I had just gone through a divorce and felt a huge sense of ""connection"" with the book. I enjoyed it so much that I was eager to read ""The Elegant Gather of White Snows."" Again, I embraced this book and felt a huge ""connection"" with the characters. I was surprised to go online and read all the negative reviews. It's interesting to note that other readers rate it with either 1-star or 5-stars, with few in the middle. To each his own, I guess. I'm someone who spent several years sacrificing my own personal happiness in a futile attempt to try to make someone else happy-and I'm ashamed to think of all the time and energy I wasted. I'm generally very independent and strong-willed, but moving on for me was a painful process. When I finally ""broke free,"" I had such a feeling of empowerment. Perhaps that is why I felt so moved by this book."
1,"Bad idea, bad book, bad writing, exploitive - NO STARS","Our reading group chose for this book out of curiousity based on the synopsis. Several of us didn't even bother to finish it. NO ONE liked it. This is the first book we've read in over 4 years that we all universally disliked. There are 8 women in our reading group between the ages of 35 and 70. We determined that the author was exploiting all of the women's issues she could possibly fit into this book (date rape, loss of a child, unwanted pregnancy, lesbianism, depression)just to grab attention to this book. And then she wraps it all up and fixes everything by having these women go on some ridiculous walk for 4 days. I suspect any positive reviews for this book were written by the author herself or her publishers. Do not buy this book. If you want to read some lightweight stuff, read a good mystery or even a romance novel. This is junk. One of the few books I would happily throw in the trash without a second thought!"
4,A well-written introduction to S/370 assembler language,"McQuillen and Prince's ""MVS Assembler Language"" has a clear sense of direction and is well written. It provides a good introduction to S/370 assembler language for the uninitiated. However, advanced students may find that it falls short from a technical point-of-view; it fails to mention the system 370 PSW, privileged opcodes, interrupt mechanism or the channel subsystem.I wish they had covered reentrant programming techniques. Coding for reentrancy in assembler language is a pervasive discipline, and really belongs at an introductory level.Consider this book if you have been charged with responsibility for maintaining someone else's assembler language code and you haven't a clue where to begin. But if you plan to do development (and especially systems programming), then this book will only take you so far."
3,pretty good...,"I borrowed this book from a classmate for a day, and i really liked it. It doesn't have pictures of naked people, but it has 2 somewhat disturbing pictures. it may seem like a huge advertising gimmick for copic, but it does give you useful information, like how to use an airbrush, how to gradate colors,mixing marker, colored pencil, and pastel colors, and tips on types paper and inks. the art seemed ugly sometimes but I tried to look over that. the guide character that appeared throughout the book looked as if the proportions were messed up; her boobs were too big, her legs too short, and she looked overall like a 7 year old.but thats ok.I liked the book. ^_^"
3,Not fun to listen to.,"Nor is it supposed to be, I guess. After two relatively upbeat and joyful records, Sting puts together one of the saddest albums I think I have ever heard.It's not an album you'll turn to frequently, and I understand it is considered a favorite amongst the rabid Sting followers.I consider myself a pretty involved fan myself, yet I can go years without hearing this one.The other reviews do a good job of conveying what is actually on the record, but honestly, it's the one Sting record that you have to work to sit through.Though it does get me thinking about one thing. I think when the day comes that my own father passes away, this just might the first record I turn to."
1,So bad!,"This book was so bad it was excruciating. I liked ""Eternity"", but Shayne's vampire stuff is awful. The characters continually remind one another that they are vampires. Sample:Vampire 1: ""Hey it's dark""Vampire 2: ""Don't worry, we are vampires! We can see in the dark!""The dialogue continues like this throughout the whole book.Shayne describes the main characer Edge as a bleached blond, thin man with a British accent who looks like Billy Idol. Why didn't she say ""Hey, it's supposed to be Spike from Buffy, ok?""One of the characters becomes pregnant. The baby talks to her in bad colloquial slang while in the womb. It's not supposed to be funny but it's hilarious.I normally wouldn't finish a piece of garbage like this but it was kind of like watching the proverbial car crash. I couldn't believe it was happening and just had to see it through.Save yourself. Don't read this book!"
3,cinderella 87,"Hi,The movie is very fun,but why did you don't this dvd in version in english?,because I don't understand german language.Nathalie."
1,Languages,"I had Purchase this movie from 1987, when i both this movie did not metion that this version is in German, since the movie was film in NY, i was expecting to see this movie in English language, Please I need some help with this, if you can exchage this movie for an English version.please let me know.Thanks"
5,Instrumental paradise.,"Those of you under sixty may not remember some of the selections on this CD but that doesn't make them any less great. For me, I was looking for several of these songs for a very long time. Topsy Pt.2, Happy Organ, Wiggle Wobble and Joy were all on this disk just waiting for me to buy it. There are other tracks on this that everyone will like. Memphis, In The Mood, The Rockford Files and A Fifth Of Beethoven all come to mind. If you like any of this music, how can you lose?"
5,Bless Someone,I can't count how many times I've given this as a gift. I know I will continue to do so.
1,If any of the Battletech-novels shouldn't have been written,"... then this is definitely the one. Perhaps not every Battletech is up to the same standard, but in 95 % of the cases even those that don't further the core events offer a consistent level of conceptuality. One of the interesting points in the Battletech-universe is that it's sci-fi without aliens, ever ... untill this author (whose other books in other FASA-settings were any good either) tried to cross that line - and delivered a book that may or may not be worth reading (to each his tastes), but should not have been part of this series. All in all, you have to be an absolute completist in Battletech to need this book."
1,Read something else,"This book is the nadir of Battletech authorship. To be fair, other authors, like Robert Thurston and Thomas Gressman, have certainly had shaky starts, but I don't look forward to another installment from Rice. The book had nothing to do with the Battletech Universe, the characters were one dimensional (barely), and the plot was rife with holes. It was like reading a first draft written in crayon."
2,"pithy, unsatisfying","I like that it was written by authors of different generations and spiritual beliefs, however it left me feeling a bit shortchanged. There just wasn't enough to the book. It was a sweet idea that missed the mark, at least for my taste and need."
4,good live album,"I used to own this album on cassette, but I thought I'd buy it on CD... I made the mistake of reading the reviews below, though. They almost talked me out of buying it.I'm glad I went with my own judgement. Caught in the Act is a much better album musically than Return to Paradise.The harmonies here aren't exactly perfect on all of the songs, but unless you're listening specifically for mistakes, you won't really notice.This is how Styx should be heard, in a one-time show while they were young, rather than at the end of a very long tour years after their prime like on Return to Paradise.The only thing I can find bad about this album is the number of songs. There are only 14 songs on the two discs, which isn't much considering the price.My suggestion is to buy both live albums... listen to this one more, then listen to the songs on Return to Paradise that don't appear on this album."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","Not a totally bad live comnpilation. Sure, there's the lame Dennis DeYoung songs (Babe, Don't Let It End and Mr. Roboto), but there's his best efforts (Come Sail Away and Suite Madame Blue).Shaw gives an excellent performance, especially on Fooling Yourself and Crystal Ball.But somebody really needs to tell JY to give up telling the ""Backwards Satanic messages"" intro to Snowblind. He's been giving this same intro for the past 19 years. Does he think that saying Styx has been accused of having Satanic lyrics makes them sound cool. If so, once the listener hears Babe, they'll be calling them all wimps and throwing the CD out the window.But I digress, this CD is worth buying, once you can get past the usual Styx fluff."
5,Smells potent,"Helped with the dogs ear, also has good anti-mite properties which could be very beneficial... If you get it on your skin it will stink like pure sulfer lotion, not a terrible smell but not that good!"
3,Can't honestly rate it yet because I haven't opened it.. Lol,"I purchased this because my bulldog had a balding hotspot and the reviews were excellent. I haven't opened it yet because I can smell it through the sealed tube!!! My bulldog lives inside and I don't think I want him, his bed, my carpet, rugs, or my furniture to smell strongly of pine oil and sulfur I wish I could use it! If it doesn't expire, I'll just hold into it until I get a house with a yard, so the smell can wear off /sticky ointment can rub off outside before he comes in the house... Lol..... It smells like it will work though."
4,The drawings were so realistic! Amelia seems so real!,I really liked this book. The drawings were so realistic and Amelia seems like a real person to me! I felt like I was on their vacation with them!
4,Update firmware!,"I put this card in an older system to run as a linux server. The card came with a pretty only firmware that wouldn't even recognize 400GB drives! This card was purchased in early 2010 and it can't recognize 400GB drives!!!!SIIG's web site does not have any firmware updates you can download for the card, so you must contact their support to gain access to their FTP server to get the latest firmware. After the firmware was updated, the controller recognized the 400GB drives and worked great with linux."
3,"Good book, needed a little more","If you are trying to figure out how to generically structure your communications with others I think this book does a good job. I think it is especially useful for presentations.Essentially, the book advocates 1. catching the readers attention, telling them what you're going to tell them, tell it to them, and then tell them what you told them - which is a good structure. The book also is quite succinct on how to execute on this structure. The problem I have is that this book doesn't deal with how to develop the content that will be integrated into this structure. I did expect the book to talk about how to select the points to discuss, how to structure each of those point for maximum effectiveness, etc. since I believe they are pretty important to speak clearly and concisely.Overall this is a book that will help you get your point across...whether it will help the clarity and conciseness is another issue."
3,Secular view of Chistian missions,"This is an excellent secular biography of a very brave woman. However, it is impossible to determine the depth of her spiritual life from it. The few quotes from her diary do not support any real determination of her deepest beliefs. We must rely on circumstantial evidence for any hint of them, i.e. the fact of her work for a Christian missionary society. But usually in biographies of those who would be considered heroes of the faith one sees much more first person testimony about their faith and relationship with Christ as motivations. See as an example ""The Hiding Place"" about Corrie ten Boom, an equally courageous heroine of the faith.My personal opinion is that Minnie Vautrin is a heroine of the faith, regardless that she was possessed in the end by the horrors she saw and fought. But it cannot be determined from this book alone."
5,Outstanding,"I stumbled across this book at the library, threw it in my basket and assumed I would read a few pages before getting bored or turned off. (I've found that a lot of grief books tend to be too 'textbook' or too 'religious', or just way too sappy.)However, once I started this book I couldn't put it down, and I was upset when it was done, as I wanted to read more!My younger brother died 2 years ago, and my father died a year ago. Almost 8 years ago, I gave birth to twins - one of who died at age 8 months.Raeburn has a wonderful way of putting into words so much of what I have been feeling over the years regarding these losses - and how these losses have shaped the person I am now. I can't begin to tell you how nice it was to read that others had the same thoughts and fears as I do."
3,Not Bad,I'm looking forward to future novels about the young detective. This wasn't so bad. I thought it was too technical especially when it refer to history about sports greats. I would like more mystery in his future novels and less history. But the ending was great.
2,Be warned...,"Muriel's Wedding is set in Australia, with Australian actors and Australian social mores. The movie has some upbeat moments and we are happy at the end that Muriel is converted from what her father dooms her to be, to what her wonderful self realizes after many not-too-helpful detours. What i would add as a note of caution for family viewers this movie has some very explicit sexual references and one scene at the beginning that would have been better left out. It could been a thoroughly edifying movie, despite some of the dysfunctions involved but unfortunately, because of the R-rated material, it fell short of its potential."
4,"An interesting idea, but one keeps asking for more...","This CD is a reduced version of a double LP album from the 60's dedicated to Oscar-winning songs. It's been out of print for a long time. I felt robbed when I saw that they only included 14 of the 33 original selections. This is the main problem with record companies (and RCA is no exception): why don't they give us the whole original material, with the original liner notes, and so on? After all, a CD can have 70+ minutes of music (the equivalent to 2 standard LPs). I ended up buying it because I like this album very much, and I'm a longtime fan of Mr. Mancini. The tune I enjoy most is ""On the Atchison..."", because Mr. Mancini managed (as usual) to make us listen to a well known song as if it were the first time we were hearing it. It's a must for those who enjoy Mr. Mancini's artistry, but the record company still owes us a real, complete re-issue of the original album. Then it will get a 10."
5,MS The first year ( newly diagnosed),"I was recently diagnosed with MS 6 months ago. This book was the best book anyone in my position could have read. It was so helpful to me. I am in the process of sending the book to my parents who live in another state, so they too can understand the complexity of this disease. Hats off to the author....."
4,Enjoyable Book That Lacks Somewhat In Narrative Power,"A parable set in the future that in part mirrors the present, ""This Alien Shore"" was engaging yet lacked the narrative power to fully capture my interest. Due to a necessity to create and explain the technological aspects of her future world, C.S. Friedman is forced to expend energy away from the narrative, thereby sapping some of its force and energy. As this is a recurring complaint that I have with much science fiction, perhaps this criticism is an individual response and should be weighed against those who find interest in the technological and theoretical concepts that I find often overburdening this genre. Those among you who turn to science fiction for its theoretical content will undoubtedly find my criticism over harsh, and I expect will enjoy this work immensely. Nonetheless I find the storyline weakened by the explanatory excursions into brainware systems, data codes, virus creations, and Guild operations. My loss, perhaps."
4,Not quite as good as I'd hoped but still worth four stars,"Freidman had a great start but too bad she fizzled at the end. There wasn't a whole lot of climax or closure which dissapointed me but this was a good deal better than alot of the crap I've read through lately. She still has that creative spark that drew me into the coldfire trilogy though it was dampened somewhat in this novel. The few minor failings aside, it was still complex and intersting read."
5,An Instant Treasure,"""This Blue Hollow"" is a tremendous gift for residents and visitors of Estes Park. Pickering's account of the area's early history is told with the warmth and intimacy of a campfire tale and a myriad of details that substantiate his story. As a casual student of history, a former part-time resident and frequent visitor of Estes Park, and an avid hiker, ""This Blue Hollow"" has given me a fresh and exhilarating perspective on the crown jewel of the Rockies.""This Blue Hollow"" is an important historical resource and a wonderful story about adventure, Rocky Mountain pioneers, and the celebration of human spirit."
4,Great chase through time,"A very good story. Continuation of past characters with broader insite of each. While the story has a tendency to lag, for my taste, the analysis and description of the Ripper, the crime and the historical time is excellent. I read the story in on sitting and look forward the next installment. Asprin and Evans have hit upon a winning series"
3,Group,"I recommend this book to be used in a group setting only, it is not challenging enough to keep an individual engaged or learning."
1,False advertising. Didn't receive items as stated on Amazon.,"I have to agree with the other reviews - the title clearly states ""12-pack"" and I only received 1 drop cloth. Not only that, my item arrived without a packing slip/return label, so I can't even return it. DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON - FALSE ADVERTISING. I like the product, they discontinued carrying these at my local hardware store, I am an artist and these have come in very handy, they absorb well and are durable and reliable.....I will, however, look for these elsewhere, not on Amazon."
4,dlaurel,simpe to understand and is well written. i would recommend this title. good overview of accounting principles and some managerial topics.
4,Works cutting PVC Central Vac pipe.,I bought this saw while installing a new central vac system in my house. The 2 inch PVC (thin wall) pipe cut with little effort and very few burs had to be sanded off. It is quite tough to get a perfect straight cut as with any hand saw. Much cheaper than buying a miter saw. I would recommend for small DIY jobs.
4,Jazz Blues Fusion,"I am so happy to have found a re-release of this album. Since it is vintage, unfortunately so is my vinyl from years past. It is a delight to once again hear the songs I so loved."
4,bike training,"Great video for beginners indoor training. Be sure to have a fan and a towel, this video will still make you sweat."
1,Very Disappointing,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. I have come to expect high quality from Brava books, this one should have never been published. The hero and heroine spend little time together and their ""love"" story is very unrealistic. Yes, a certain amount of reality must be suspended when reading these types of books, but this one is beyond ridiculous. Stephanie falls in love with Jack after spending so little time with him. The book is more about Stephanie's friend Venus and her life than it is about Stephanie and Jack. Besides the sub-par plot, the writing is also very weak. Skip this one and try out anything by Shannon McKenna."
3,"While Close's voice disappoints, the score is breathtaking.","While I'm sure Glenn Close's acting abilities in the much anticipated Lloyd Webber musical, ""Sunset Boulevard"" were memorable, you can't help being disappointed by her vocal abilities. Her voice seemed average at best. I purchased the CD after seeing the touring production starring Petula Clark, whose impeccable voice electrified the entire theatre. All I can say is that Close wasn't Clark. Ms. Clark or Patti LuPone, who was originally cast for the part, would be a much better CD purchase. Although I enjoyed the music and the memories it stirred of seeing the production, I give this CD a very average rating. There are better versions out there."
2,Color blind,The description states the color is Ivory.The label on the package states Ivory.The product is snow white.Not a good experience.
5,Wow!!!!,"This is the 1st 'Japaneze' book I've read! I didn't like the nudety scenes, the book would be better without them... The humor is perfectly placed & I can't wait to read the next one!!!!"
5,"60 lb rot mix LOVES it, 3rd one, lasts about 6 months","I love this toy! My 60 lb. rot mix loves to chew, and he has a whole basket of toys. Usually he rips out the squeaker immediately. However, with the mat, he shakes it and fetches it, and occasionally rips a squeaker out. But it takes about 6 months for him to get around to getting them ALL out. He loves trying to find the remaining squeakers. It's big enough that it doesn't get lost. Also I have even thrown it into the washing machine if he took it outside. Not sure how long it would last if it were his ONLY toy--I recommend nylabone too (the biggest one: Souper 8"" good for tough chewers) and having some other plush toys to choose from--he loves picking the ones he wants out of the basket! ;-) But I highly recommend the large mat with multi-squeakers. I'm about to order the fourth one in about 2 years. ;-)"
2,Seriously flawed,"This book could have been an enjoyable and useful resource, but unfortunately it is riddled with factual errors. I can only recommend this to researchers who are able to verify the information within before using this book as a source. Anyone else will have to guess which information is correct and which is false. (Examples: on page 173, Hughes states that the 1.66:1 ratio, which SK adopted for A Clockwork Orange, was subsequently used on Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. This is completely wrong. Barry Lyndon was shot in 1.77:1, and The Shining and Full Metal Jacket were shot in 1.33:1 and projected in 1.85:1-though the DVD and video version of the latter 2 films preserved the original 1.33:1 format. Another mistake is a quote supposedly from The Film Director as Superstar by Michel Ciment. Since Joseph Gelmis was the author of this book, and Ciment the author of another, it will take some detective work to figure out which Hughes means.)"
3,Too heavy to wear,"Can't wear them because they hurt my ears. If you don't have strong ear lobes, I would not recommend these."
2,Style turned me off,"While the action was exciting, I found a lot about this book that I didn't like. First, I simply didn't find Broker to be a compelling protagonist. He just isn't that likable; he's uptight, unemotional (he barely related to his baby and his wife), and detached. Second, the transformation of James from hapless loser to what he becomes seemed a stretch. Third, and most important, I disliked Chuck Logan's style. One, I didn't like the herky-jerky, staccato sentence fragments. Two, there was a lot of clunky, unwieldy phraseology (duty ""thudded through room after empty room""). Three, the grammar was odd-commas were omitted, periods were used where there should have been question marks, and commas were used where semicolons belong. My negative comments are obviously in the minority, but I just didn't like the style."
4,Poignant and Powerful,"Linda Back McKay tells the stories of women who surrendered children for adoption, because the cultural milieu of the time permitted no other option. Her work is delivered with sensitivity and authenticity for the emotional trauma these mothers experienced. This book is extremely well written and McKay is to be commended for her courage!"
5,Works well and inexpensive,"This RAM arrived within a matter of days in the correct shipping container. It is important to avoid static buildup when dealing with computer components, so it was reassuring to see the anti-static bag upon opening the box.Installation is straightforward, no tweaking is necessary, and it works perfectly in my oldschool E-Machines M5310. Basic applications start and function much faster - why didn't I upgrade my RAM years ago?"
5,I recommend it,"If you like paella, you should go for this pan. I have not tried others, but this one does the job really well! I also like the fact that it is made in Spain, and that it washes well. No complaints!"
4,Good quality for the price,"Not much you can expect from a Paella pan. It should cook Paella well, stand up to handling and washing, retain its finish. It does all this just fine. Nice heavy steel construction for good heat conduction but enameled for easy cleanup and without the rust problem of the traditional bare steel pans. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that we use it only sometimes so I have no proof of how it will stand the long haul. It looks like it will make it just fine though."
3,"Very entertaining, but not as good as the first book in the series","I really love Williams' setting - the futuristic city combined with the way that various Asian mythologies permeate every nook and cranny. The blending of the two is very skillfully done. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, and was mostly happy reading this next one, but I can't say that it holds up as well - I felt that it had a few dead spots, and the ending felt a little rushed. But it doesn't stop me from being excited about reading the next one in the series, so whatever weaknesses the book may have, they're not at all fatal."
4,The dog who saved Halloween,It was a cute movie for all ages and would recommend everyone to watch itlots of fun and excitement and suspensful
3,Couldn't hold attention of young children (3-5 years old),The acting was not great and the video quality sub-par. The plot had the potential for a really cute and interesting story. Disappointed the movie couldn't keep my girls' attention.
1,Not the Best Therapy Book Available,"This book is a compilation of phone calls that Dr. Laura received on her radio show. Although they were excellent examples of the wisdom she shares, there wasn't much practical advice on how to overcome a childhood of abuse and live a fulfilling life without that baggage. I walked away from this book feeling better because I knew I wasn't alone in this struggle, but there wasn't much guidance to inspire change in my life.For anyone trying to heal from childhood abuse, I would recommend reading ""Reinventing Your Life: The Breakthrough Program to End Negative Behavior...and Feel Great Again"" by Jeffrey Young. This book is much more intensive and focuses on healing the source of your problems.Reinventing Your Life: The Breakthough Program to End Negative Behavior...and Feel Great Again"
3,Dr Laura Bad Childhood,"I read the book before I gave it to my sister and then in return for her to give it to our mother. I thought it was a pretty good book, it helped me to understand more of where my mother was coming from, or rather her limitations in life and as being my mother. It helped me to understand how she is unknowingly (even though I have told her) passing this on to my siblings and how they eat it up, sadly. I thought maybe it would help specifically me, but it helped me to understand others better. I guess it did help. I just would have rather there have been more discussion on the subject of bad child hood instead of call-ins put into words."
5,"Many people, if not most, should read this book.","Exactly what IS a bad childhood? Bad means different things to different people. This book deals with situations that every rational person would agree are BAD and with situations that are less bad and/or sad. No matter, the book is very helpful and easy to read.I would not say that reading this book replaces therapy for those who are badly damaged but it does not claim to do so. It helps people deal with, accept and move past difficult childhood situations.Reading ""Bad Childhood Good life...."" is helpful even for those whose childhoods were magical because it helps these lucky people to understand friends, co-workers and family members whose childhoods were colored with bad, tedious or sad experiences."
3,Not so good as the show,"I do agree with the basic premise of the book which is: You may have a good life despite a bad childhood. This is a basic but important message, as much of the therapy in this world revolves around re-living trauma, and in essence staying stuck there. There's really no merit in that.If you like the Dr. Laura radio program, than you know she promotes her books on air. The problem is, I have yet to read one of her books that's as good as the show. Listening to her opinions day after day gives one a full round understanding of her world view much more eloquently than any one of her books. They're ok as supplements, but they're all pretty slim volumes, and I suspect if you gave one to someone who is not an avid listener they may not be swayed."
3,Didn't think of that...,"Good observations, will help you expose some issues, but... you're screwed without the Lord."
3,as funny as stupid,"Some boring guys get together, pretending cute, and wrote up a big comic book. Fooling around is good for something, but this one is too much. Though they don't care about precious time, you are fooled all the way. I never laughed while I read it -- not interesting at all.Boring for college students, and meaningless for pedestrians.I suggest Tolstov, if you want SOME fun and MUCH knowledge, but DO NOT have much time.Don't waste your time and money if you would study science."
5,This could be your cat's favorite place,"I have 3 cats, and they all romp around on this, but my male kitty lays on this for probably a good 12 hours a day...NOT exaggerating. We've had it many years now, and although my kitty is a little on the heavy side, this stands up to his weight and has never given us a problem. Kitties have gotten sick on this, and washing it is not a big deal either. Considering how much use this thing gets on a DAILY basis, it's an absolute must!"
5,Vitamins,I 've felt a good effect from this product. It's balanced things out in general and I've felt some deeper breathing.
5,Great Grate!,"I bought this as a gift with whole nutmeg. I thought it was more useful than the nutmeg grinder I have, because mine is strictly for nutmeg, and this can be used and washed and used for many different nuts, cheeses, and chocolate. And because it attached to the grater, the grate can be varied as desired."
5,Labor makes a comeback,"This is important because it talks about the rise of service unions. Here in Detroit, its easy to think that unions are losing ground, but this book shows that they're changing and gainign power. I never knew a union of women and Spanish people could be so influential."
5,Great Book!,"Can't believe some others didn't like this one. I bought ""Easy FrontPage 2000"" first. What a waste. This one got me going and actually enjoying my work on FrontPage. I'd get this one folks. Its a keeper."

4,UNCUT: You cannot unwatch it.,"Whenever I go to Magic Mountain, I always start at one of the smaller coasters to get myself ready for the larger coasters. A Serbian Film is one of those movies you have to work yourself up to. If you've seen the Saw movies, Faces of Death series or actual torture footage, you might be ready. If I had seen the EDITED version, I would have thought it was an interesting story, well-shot with a bizarre twist at the end. The problem with the UNCUT is that the scenes that remain are dynamite blasts in a world of gunfire. They not only steal the show, they misplace the peaks and draw away for the dramatic base of the film.Do I recommend this film? As I state in the title of this review, you cannot unwatch this film. It takes you to a place that some may not be comfortable going. So, watch at the own risk. The good news is there a digital copy included, so you can take it anywhere."
1,THERE'S MORE IN THE CUT VERSION,MY 95 MIN CUT VERSION SHOWED ALL OF THE CONTROVERSIAL SCEENS. THIS NEW 107 MIN UNCUT VERSION CUT 2 OF THE MAIN SCEENS OUT. DO NOT GET RIPPED OF LIKE I DID. THESE GUYS ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS. PLEASE BUY THE 95 MIN CUT VERSION IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!
3,It's Cut.,"The two most essential scenes are missing from the film. Total runtime is 103 minutes. Deeply disappointed. Not because I'm a sick bastard, but because they've completely undermined the point of the film, and the suffering of Milos and his family. I'm only giving this three stars because of the picture quality (which is quite good)."
5,Prepare to be shocked,"Everything from the packing to the lack of features tells what kind of film you are about see. I remember leaving a review and then erasing it because I couldn't get past the empty feeling that bothered me after watching this. I've heard of torture porn before, but this film just overwhelms the senses. I also couldn't get past the characters who put the milo and his family through it all just to make a ""snuff film"". Even watching standard porn fare these days you can see how these preformers treat each other and it doesn't take much to imagine that people who just see others as property exist. The empty feeling came from just being so overwhelmed and feeling these characters emotions. This is a truely effective film and one of the most controversial films ever made. Not for the squeamish!"
1,REAL UNCUT RELEASE ON 22nd of MAY 2012. THIS ONE IS CUT!!!,This version is CUT. Wait until the 22nd of May 2012 and you will get the REAL UNCUT DVD from INDEPENDENT FILMS as the US version.
5,One You Won't Forget,"This film takes a queue from Stanley Kubrick's classic film theme of man's inability to control his own destiny. The film's main character Milos accepts a film offer which progressively gets more and more disturbing. This movie pulls no punches and pushes all the boundaries of sex and violence, but not just for the sake of being shocking. It truly is an excellent film, as long as one is not easily offended."
1,Simply horrible!,"Each time I thought this book couldn't get worse -- it did! The plot was implausible from the beginning, the hero and heroine never really fall in love (can you believe it!). The prose is so ridiculous that I couldn't decide whether to laugh or just be embarrased for the author. If one more character ""seized up"" with desire I thought I would throw the book out. Secondary characters are having raunchy sex even before the main characters. Motivations of characters are withheld from the reader so that we feel no sympathy for them. If you believe a virgin could really impersonate Europe's greatest exotic dancer and courtesan, well, you might enjoy this book. But I doubt it."
4,Takes a Lickn',"A great watch, this is my second one, the first one lasted me about 5 years, but went through more catastrophes than you can imagine."
1,not as pictured,"This item does not look like the picture at all, and unfortunately the thermometer does not appear to be working correctly"
1,I could of HUNG myself for buying this book!,"Sorry to say It didnt grab me. The topics were no different than the average conversation about black men and the size of their penis. This book was written to say what exactly. To prove what point, all of which has been said before. Ok if im paying damn near $20.00 for a book, tell me something i dont know!"
3,"Not the sequel to ""I Spit On Your Grave"".","The title on the disk for this movie is type set in a way to make you think that this movie is actually a sequel to ""I Spit On Your Grave"". However, it is far from it. And it probably even precedes ""I Spit On Your Grave"" by several years. In fact, it's not even related to the movie.The reason I bring that up is because I rented it at a local video rental store thinking it was a sequel. However, it actually turned out to be a decent slasher flick and actually kept my friends and I guessing who the murderer is (even though the movie makes you think that a certain character is doing all the killings).This film wasn't groundbreaking by any means. But if your looking for a decent slasher flick from the very early '80s, then this is one to check out."
1,don't waste your time,"Even though the storyline is alright the movie is not worth seeing. The sound is aweful, the acting is bad, the filiming sucks and the special effects are below b-movie. This movie is only worth seeing for the full nudity, and even that is sub-par.I would only suggest this to people who collect indie or b movie horror."
2,Price hikes sour the deal,"+Great product-Sorry business model (hence the rating)While the product is top quality I think it is pretty crumby for the seller to almost double their prices practically overnight. For 2 dollars less I can buy the same product from the local hardware store, as a longtime customer of smallparts (tons of orders with them) I am Very Disappointed."
1,Not a stoner movie at all,"If your into the hilarious drug related comedies such as the classic Cheech & Chong films I would not recomend this movie, not alot of drugs, not too funny and a bit cheesy."
3,Gardening Therapy,"This book is mostly an autobiography. I found the author very interesting, but am put off by his constant criticism of other gardening methods. It felt like a therapy session for him to write this book. I don't recommend this book for someone who just want to know how to grow food. If, however, you just like reading books about gardening and growing in general then it will do just fine. Good info on seeds and how to grow from seed. Ingredients recommended have been difficult for me to find."
3,Gardening help,"This is a decent book, written by a good man with lots of experience. There is useful information, but it is generally confusing because of a lack of illustrations. A simple diagram of a garden layout would have been much more helpful than lots of words and charts.Also, from the title, I expected in-depth discussions on what to do in hard times - planting, saving seed, preservation, etc., but that segment is missing. Good intentions, but hard to read."
4,good but needs more pictures,This is a good book to have on hand for reference. I would like to of seen more illustrations in it because the reading can be a bit boring but it still is a great book.
3,Useless for Urban Gardeners,"Although this book is subtitled ""Growing Food in Hard Times"", it seems that those living in cities are somehow exempt from hard times and the need/desire to grow food.This book, like Eliot Coleman's books, works on the premise that you either have close to a half an acre or more or will lease/purchase this amount of land for gardening. Like Coleman, Solomon goes on and on about how the methods he describes will outproduce inefficiently composted ""postage stamp beds in a tiny back yard"" (p. 4).As an urban gardener on a 60' x 90' lot without the means to purchase acreage, this book is an exercise in frustration. The techniques are presented with the assumption that one has at least a 100' long plot to work with, with room for wide rows.For urbanites, Lee Reich's Weedless Gardening, Mel Bartholomew's Square Foot Gardening, Lasagna Gardening, the French biointensive method and/or micropermaculture are more applicable. I'm disappointed with this purchase."
5,Absolute soul....simply awesome,"Ann nesby with her debut effort places herself in the league of the very best with this extremly deep soulful cd..i mean teaming up with jam and lewis and nat addley jnr famous for producing Luther balllads vandross that is...I have looked for this album ever since i heard the first single i'm still wearing your name and well 3 years later i'm not disappointed and i would gladly say that she is in the same league with aretha,patti,anita, AND TO MAKE IT BETTER she even toured with luther anyway..besides the steve hurley tracks the rest of the cd is superb especailly the subtly sensual what a lovely evening it would be..hope you come out with a new album hon i just love your sound peace!!!"
4,Worked Great!!,I was very happy with the quick shipping and quality of the product. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,The Right Product - Right Price,"I received a cartridge, in new condition, several days before the date promised. And I saved $50, over buying the same cartridges in a retail store, by buying in bulk (black and color combo at the same time) using Amazon."
2,I'm too old for this,"Sorry, but all the childish chatter is annoying. Too wordy about trivialities, hardly any explanation of the hard stuff. We are presented with big equations with no definition of the unfamiliar symbols, and are expected to get it through osmosis and repetition.Incorrect statments are presented as facts, to be later modified or corrected (sometimes). Sloppy language, as when electrostatic force is called magnetic. No mistake, the subject matter is heavy stuff, but this presentation won't get you to the desired understanding, only to a wide-eyed, childish ""wow!""I much prefer reading Gamow, Hawking, Weinberg, Feynman, and others, even when they use few equations. What good are the equations that are not supported by adequate explanations or even definition of terms?"
4,A Very Good CD,"This is a very good CD. The lyrics and music are great. The lead singer has a very distinctive voice and at times sounds the same on many of the tracks. However, on the whole, this is a great CD with some great songs."
5,Fantastic Production......I am addicted!!!,"Shameful that this work has been so neglected!!!!!I am a life long opera addict. Yet I can't think of a more joyful opera than this. If I were Opera Czar, I would require it be shown in all schools. Not just for the marvelous music and dancing, but also the morality. Parson All talk can preach to me anytime."
4,Not as I expected but ok,"I was expecting it to be clear as it is called ""clear marble tongue ring"" and the picture is pretty clear however it is more white than clear. It is ok but not what I was looking for. Shipping was quick."
1,no KOBE BRYANT,one reason why this dvd sucks no KOBE BRYANT. KOBE is one of the nba's greatest players. he's got one of the meanest crossover and dunks.
2,re-makes,I'm certainly not a BDW fan - but very disappointed at the Rich Mullins remake. Seldom does one improve on the original (as was the case here) so what is the point? Write your own songs and leave others alone.
3,Amazing adventures,"John Boyes lived several lifetimes worth of adventures. I found this book to be entertaining at times but somewhat tedious as well. If you are a collector of safari and colonial era books you should by all means add this title to your collection. For the more casual reader I would start with Corbett, Patterson, Ruark and Capstick. Their writing is much more consistently engaging in my opinion."
1,wouldn't even work,"I installed all 3 of these games, and none of them would work! They kept shutting down right after they started.I had to return them, get my money back!"
5,a great glove for what i need,"i was a little unsure of choosing this glove, as i was worried the material may be too thin or too hot on the hands, since i live in southern california. this product arrived on time and in good condition. When first putting them on they were a little scratchy but feel fine after washing them. i have been using these gloves for about a week for work and they have done a great job of keeping my hands comfortably warm and blister free."
5,Nice,These gloves are great. The gloves are very affordable and they work great. My only minor complaint is with the writing on the wrist of the gloves. It was painted or printed on and is peeling off. This inevitably leaves little white chips of paint all over my sleeves of whatever shirt I am wearing. After a few washes this problem was eliminated.I would recommend these gloves.
2,Cheap,"The price was right, so I should not be surprised, but the quality was not high. Many strings needed to be trimmed and look like they will unravel with use. On the bright side, they do appear to be fairly warm."
3,OK,"I have relatively large hands and these are almost too long for me. They also tend to ride off the hands when worn with any kind of jacket, since there is not much elastic in the wrists. Be aware also that you will receive two completely identical gloves, down to the printed text (which, as another reviewer stated, will wear off). Still, these are adequate low-cost fingerless gloves. I don't know why you want fingerless gloves, but unless you have very small hands, these will probably work."
5,Shared Humanity,"This beautifully written story describes the experiences of the Donner Party travelling west to live in California. The extreme solution for hunger that they used and for which they are primarily known is a small part of the story. Rather, the enormity of the decision to lift up roots and move family and possessions by horse and wagon into a rugged and unknown wilderness is what is so powerfully described. James D. Houston has the ability to dramatically portray many different personality types interacting with each other. He brings out the best and worst traits in his characters; traits that happen to be readily identifiable for most readers. His technique of using an 82 year old woman's recollections of when she was the 8 year old daughter of Jim Reed, one of the main characters, adds realism and pathos to an already emotional and sad story. This novel is highly recommended for those who want to reflect upon our shared humanity with the American pioneers who preceded us."
5,Elevating a Genre,"The problem with most historically based fiction, I find, is that the writer is rarely both a good researcher and a ""real"" novelist (a real novelist being a writer who takes history and brings the kind of poetic analysis and vision that is probably truer than the facts). James D. Houston in this book has converged the talents of a library pack rat with the stylistic and visionary grasp equal to any of America's contemporary novelists. This is the kind of book that should be assigned in history classes, just to turn people on to history and great writing. It goes way beyond, of course, a recounting of the Donner Party, and takes into the hearts and minds of human beings in a way that only a great novelist can. This book deserves a wide audience. It is a major piece of American fiction."
3,Decent,"This book on Tom Waits, one of my favorite artists, reads like one long newspaper article and most of the information seems to have come from past interviews. And considering that Waits himself loves to tell false facts to interviewers, it is hard to tell how much of this is fact and how much Tom is snickering about. The book also contains song-by-song commentary on almost every Waits album. The man's life was and is very interesting but Jacobs just did not hold my complete attention all the way through. It is quite funny due to Waits' quoted wisecracks. I feel the publisher's cover price is a little high, even for what the stores call an ""oversized paperback"". You will probably want to buy it here considering it is at a reduced price and also considering that this book shows up in local bookstores about as often and the man himself."
2,Cute but broken,"My 6 yr. old daughter received this for her birthday and it worked for about an hour. I had already read the other reviews so I was aware of the crank breaking easily. But even though she was very gentle with the toy, it is just not made well. And since I was unable to fix it, I emailed Hasbro and received no response. This toy is not worth the money and frustration."
5,The Hydrogen Murder,I like this periodic table mystery series because of the clever plots and that I learn something about each of the elements used in the murders. I know people would like science better if it were related to something they already love like reading mysteries - that I could read this book on my Kindle was an added bonus.
5,Great Book!,"I recommend this book to anyone who wants to do some serious programming with the Lego Mindstorms kit. The four authors are experts in different areas like LegOS, NQC, pbForth, and even on making your own sensors for the robot.The illustrations are very well done and make building the robots a simple task. The programming examples are very clear, and easy to follow, yet still fun to do. I particularly like the variety of the book. There are many projects, and they illustrate different features of the robots and the different programming envorinments. On the desktop side, it has examples on getting the system working on several platforms, like Linux, or Microsoft Windows.This is most certainly the best advanced Lego Mindstorms book you'll find, and at a great price, too."
1,Don't buy this CD,"Don't buy this CD if you expect to hear the popular radio versions of all these songs, because you will not. This CD contains the stereo recordings and the difference is quite noticeable. One does not hear the great instrumentals or soulful vocals that made these songs #1s in the 80s. I was VERY disappointed with this CD. I don't even listen to it, instead it sits on my shelf collecting dust. I recommend that you purchase a different CD that specifically states it contains the original radio versions of these songs, you will thank me later."
1,"Incomprehensible and, er, wrong.","Read the Book Description and please tell me if it is a translation:""In ""Closing Arguments,"" the Ramseys are tried in the Spiritual Court. The reader becomes a part of the jury where evidence is presented that a traditional jury is deprived of. The author has offered to break bread with the Ramseys. Should they accept the invitation for a rendezvous, they can hear the confession they made through their unconscious mind.""Is this rubbish really meant to be English?Then there's the fact that the author has published THREE reviews below of his own book that are barely coherent. The fact he has befriended Charles Manson explains a lot.Oh, and there's the small issue of the real killer being arrested in Thailand, months after the alleged killer, Patsy Ramsey, has died of cancer. Better get back to the drawing board and revisit this unconscious mind garbage Rubacher..."
1,"Aw geez, Richard!","A writer reduced to posting a ""review"" of his own book on a retailer's site? Offhand, I can't think of a more self-serving action. Or one that shouts ""Amateur!"" more loudly.If your publisher doesn't immediately give you a crash course in professional etiquette, it probably means that he or she has already given up. Trust me, appearing this desperate does nothing for your credibility.Berkeley Hunt"
5,A page turning view of science in today's world,"Brace yourself for a stuningly engrossing discussion by the world renown scientist, Carl Sagan, on the subject of science in relation to our modern world. Go back in history to the beginning of time and trace the development of scientific, and not so scientific, thought leading up to the present day. Delve into the relationships between science, religion, magic, alien life forms, and many more fascinating interfaces that you may never have contemplated before. An extraordinarily well written text by a well loved hero of our time, who brings scientific principles to the common man in understandable fashion. Carl Sagan may be gone, but with this work, he certainly will not be forgotten."
2,The worst non-fiction a great mind can write,"Yes, indeed Sagan blasts pseudoscience quite effortlessly... his opponents... TABLOID JOURNALISTS who have NO credability in mainstream thought. Though I agree with practically everything Sagan says in this book, he commits an unforgivable sin of logical presentation. NOT ONCE does he explain WHAT then scientific method is. It is very possible that over 50% of all Americans do not know what the scientific method is. Sagan should have devoted some space to explaining what this thing 'the scientific method' is. Though it sounds grand, it has many limitations. Instead of wasting our time with his rantings, he should have taken some time educating."
5,All you need to know about critical thinking,"Unfortunately, this book is often considered a science book or about the scientific method. The subtitle is ""Science as a Candle in the Dark."" That was an unfortunate choice because, with the exception of one chapter (I won't say which)it is much farther reaching than that.It is about how we know what we know and how and why that frequently is incorrect. It considers why we are so un-critical in our acceptance of authoritarian statements from any source - scientific, social, business or political. The book is worth it just for the description and discussion of the ""Baloney Detection Kit.""Though Sagan was by training a scientist, his knowledge of history and culture makes this (as well as most of his books) a compelling, enlightening and enjoyable read."
5,Essential Reading,"This book is just the thing to silence the tide of those who think they know what the scientific method is all about. it shuts the door on all the quackery that is being sold to a nation of people who get their news and science from People magazine and Inside Edition. the section on logic should be required reading for high school seniors. read it carefully and you will see that it is NOT anti religion, nor is anti spiritual. it is simply pro science, and not just facts and figures, but the scientific method as a WAY Of THINKING. he acknowledges science's shortcomings. if you can open your mind instead of grasping your fear, read this book."
4,It's about thinking . . .,A really good book about science as a way of thinking. It would make a good textbook.
5,Excellent! Some common sense for our demon-haunted times.,"This is one of the best books ever written! Carl has shown the many great follies of mankind's serial stupidity and offers Science, skepticism, and commons sense as the cure. His ""baloney detection kit"" should be required reading for all students. That chapter alone will wake one up to the b.s. one encounters everywhere today. This book is a MUST READ!!!"
1,Not a very scientific book,"I have a background in Science, but I think the argument Mr. Sagan is making is not a very sound one. To rationally argue that science is ""better"" for mankind, you have to define an evaluation criteria of what makes human life better. He does not do that and tries to provide examples of how science helps move human life forward on the values that are present today. And then he mixes up many things...its just not great"
3,sagansaspiritnow,"Great book! I bought into it. Except when I got down to the last chapter, I went on vacation with several friends near Eureka Springs, AR. One buddy and myself stepped outside late the first night to view the stars. A spinning ball of light the size of a bowling ball came up to me, hovered about four feet from me for five seconds, making sure I saw it, then sped off into the sky! My buddy was petrified and feared for his life! I was elated.I never finished the book and wonder if that was Sagan's spirit with 'orders from above' to tell those who buy into this book that THERE ARE things from other worlds, as this thing was not from OUR world. Easy for people who spend there lives behind a desk with a fancy degree to tell the rest of us we are haunted by demons and our imaginations.Great book-read it, but don't believe it.........."
5,Don't read this book if you're afraid of reality.,"Since psuedo-science and the belief in anything unusual seem to be making a return to our society, I wish this book could be required reading in our high schools. It never will be however, as the ideas in the book are too frightening for most."
4,A fine guide that teaches the scientific way of thinking,"This is a fine book that teaches skeptical methods of thinking, but Carl seems to state the obvious to often throughout this book, such as the validity of witchcraft or alien abductions. Irrespective, Carl does bring up many good points about the dangers of accepting popularized ideas without proper scrutiny and questioning. This book is a must read for any Carl Sagan fan. For those who have never read any of Carl's books however, I suggest starting off with Sagan's Cosmos."
5,The louis haunted world,"Why is it that so many people think that there are ""Two sides to every story"" Even when the evidence is stacked in favor of a specific point of view. I'm sorry Mr. louis but all opinions are not equal. Everybodies point of view is not equaly backed by the evidence. Don't you care about the truth Mr. smith? It matters whether A medical treatment works or not. It matters if you waste your life on a good sounding supernatural fantasy. Real wisdom and intelligence involve being in touch with what is likly to be true. Your assertion that we live in world haunted by reason is absurd and scary. More people need to realize that evidence and true actually matter. I applaud Dr. Sagan for clearly pointing this out"
5,STUNNING and TRAGIC,"Carl Sagan was a genius, and his book is nothing short of brilliant. Nevertheless, he has wasted his time. Most humans are addicted to ignorance and superstition. Witness the undying popularity of institutionalized religion, secular religion (aka psychotherapy), and the public's adoration of the talking head/talk show circuit. I fear that if we are lucky, we may come to our senses many generations from now. Despite the advances of technology since the dawn of recorded history, most humans share the mind set of their cave dwelling ancestors. Read and weep."
5,A must-read for the human race as we enter the 21rst century,"The scientific method itself is more important than any one of its resulting hypotheses.Humankind should take special care of recognizing questionable claims, since there will be many unscientific and questionable claims being made during the next several years (around the beginning of the 21rst century).This book is a good reminder to think twice before believing anything"
4,Just what I wanted,"WDAS FM CLASSIC SOUL HITS,VOL.2 was just what I was looking for. it contains all the songs that meant something to me. It's a part of me."
4,BUENO !!,"muy entretenido---estas son las cancienes en el dvd---1-QUE PENA, 2-LAURITA, 3-NO ME PREGUNTEN POR EL,4-TE RETO A QUE ME OLVIDES, 5-QUE DIFICIL ES, 6 QUISIERA AMARTE MENOS, 7-NO DIGAS NADA, 8-DILE A ELLA, 9-CARINO SANTO, 10-ES COSA DE EL.. que lo disfruten.."
3,Not Mantovani and his Orchestra original,"This CD, while very good, is not one with tracks recorded with Annunzio Mantovani on the podium regardless of the name and picture on the cover. It is by the Mantovani Orchesta."
4,Great soothing music,There's nothing like this project. The Image of You is probably one of the best songs ever!
1,Disappointment with the item,This product is an old early 90s era model. The product I received does not work on newer tvs. I tried a number of ways. Maybe it will work for older tv models.I would not suggest purchase of this product online. Maybe buy it in store so you can atleast return it. Return shipping is more expensive than the product itself.
3,Depressing,"More literature focused on devastation and deathly destruction!! Television and newspapers already deluge us with too many stories of this type. We don't need more.Although he offers some interesting information and writes well, Joseph's technique of basing his assumption that Atlantis was a late Bronze Age society on a combination of material from a variety of writers, many of whom believe Atlantis existed long before that time, offers only confusion to the knowledgeable reader..."
5,The Title alone sold me...,"Anyone who comes up with a title like THE MAKING OF A BEST SELLER, and then puts the words: authors, editors, agents, and booksellers in the subtitle, has immediatly captured those of us who have written books, are writing books, are selling books, or dream of ever writing a book. This morning after Amazon sent me an email saying I might like this book...and I read the title... I was compelled me to stop and look. Then I read the first chapter and immediately knew I'd refer this book to all my author friends. I'm buying this book because as the author of four books, three with a major publisher - I still only DREAM of making the New York Times best seller list! And dreams need the fuel of inspiring stories. Good job,Brian Hill, and Dee Power!"
1,I think this book was a total waste of trees,"Being fairly experienced in 3d StudioR4, I purchased the inside series. The books for R4 and Autocad, were fairly well written. Assuming this would be the same, I bought the Inside 3DSMAX book. And lo and behold, it seems as little more than an advertisement for the programs features, and has little practical knowledge. If it is aimed at beginners, then it should have reflected that in the title. T o add insult to injury, this fifty+ dollar book is only one in a series of books, forcing you to buy three books to get one complete? reference. I am currently learning Max2.5 and am looking for a good book, and you can be assured it will not be the inside series."
3,Get volume 2 of this same title.,"This was my second 3D Studio max book. Buying it then was a mistake. There are many introductory books out there and this is one of the best but the problem is that the followup to this book; Inside 3DSMax vol 2, has everything vol 1 does and more. Get it if you are just starting out, and then I hope you are not scared of big books because this is where you start off, and start off well. If you already know your way around Max and just want to know advanced stuff like material manipulation and smoother models, get volume 2."
4,"interesting information, not necessarily charlie trotter only","I bought this book after seeing Charlie speak at the ACF conference in Vegas '08. Charlie is very impressive and an excellent speaker.What I didn't understand is that Charlie did not write this book.It's pretty interesting, not as powerful as the speaker I witnessed."
2,"Better if ""as told to"" rather than ""as interpreted by""","As a big fan of Trotter and his innovation and creativity, I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, it's just not very good. Mr. Clarke uses a notion or two per chapter that Trotter has applied as a successful entrepeneur, then boils it down, oversimplifies it, and creates tedious little pop quizzes of the ""rate yourself"" variety. It's as if he doesn't know whether he's writing a do-it-yourself workbook or a study of business. Clarke's very intrusive and heavy-handed, and this blunts the force of the good observations he does make. All in all, Clarke's interpretations of Trotter's wisdom lack the ring of authenticity of someone who's actually done what he espouses. This would be a lot better if it was actually Trotter doing the teaching."
1,The photo is not of an under-counter radio! (It is is some type of cable connector),The photo is not of an under-counter radio! (It is is some type of cable connector)
2,Careful,"Seeing as how I was too young to appreciate most of the Britpop that came out in the early to mid 90's, I went on a musical discovery of that era. Oasis, Blur, Longpigs, and a few others. Then I heard Walkaway and thought, lets have a look this Cast. Not trying to offend anyone, but this CD is not enjoyable. I would dare to say that they were a one hit wonder. Grab the two good songs and run. Good thing I got this at a used place."
3,"Great memories, lousy audio","As a lifelong tigers fan, i sat down to play this dvd with high hopes. i had the 1968 and 1984 highlight films on vhs, ordered from MLB several years ago. Somehow, they flubbed on the transfer. At several points during the films, the audio drops out and the video jumps -- who watched this in the editing room and approved the final print? It is very disconcerting to watch this. If you are a Tiger fan, you'll likely suffer this to watch your heroes win again, but wince during the key moments that are dropped from the audio track. They need to re-issue a clean version and i need to get a refund."
4,something's missing,"The Betty Crocker bread machine book is great, it has lots of very nice recipes, but I was missing one thing: It would help if the kind of cycle for the certain baking goods could be stated, (i.e. Pizza dough, artisian dough, rolls, breads. etc.) this would help to set the right menu number on the unit."
3,A comprehensive book.,A good recipe for broiche would be a nice addition. Measurements for 1 lb loafs would also be very helpful.
4,"Variety of recipes, but wish they were all natural ingredients","This book offers a lot of great recipes, but many of them use ingredients like ""mashed potatoe mix"", which is the kind of foods we're trying to stay away from.. I wish all the ingredients were fresh, natural ingredients.. Not sure what I could replace the mashed potatoe mix with.But having said that, the book is full of really tasty sounding recipes. I've made 3 loafs so far of different flavors and they've all turned out perfect. The recipes are easy to follow and very quick to put together..The book design itself is a little annoying. It's got a spiral binding and the last several pages of the index continually pop out of the spine... I've tried repeatedly to put them back, but they won't stay.I'm glad I purchased the book but I will be trying to find another that doesn't depend on processed foods as ingredients..."
3,Breads lack variety in consistency but info/reasearch great,"There are several very positive comments that I have about this book. First, the recipes were tested on all 3 sizes of loaves. Therefore, sometimes proportions of ingredients will not necessarily agree with proportions of bread weight in order to get the same bread. I was happy to have someone else go through these tests so that I didn't have to. Another interesting element to this book is that they show pictures of how ""wrong"" breads look and list what possible ingredients were out of proportion. This is very helpful in analyzing the outcome of your bread. Finally, I am a picture person and all of the breads have beautiful pictures next to them.The big negative I found in the book was that all of the breads I made (about 7) had the same consistency. If you are interested in creating more interesting types of breads, such as light airy french breads with crunchy crusts or ciabatta's - you will be hard pressed to find them in this book."
1,"Latex paint looked like ""orange peel"" with this sprayer!! Returned sprayer for refund.","I bought this sprayer thinking it would do as good of a job as painting with spray cans. Well...I was wrong. I used this sprayer with latex enamel from Sherwin Williams. I also did a lot of prep work to the table before painting, such as sanding and priming with Kilz. The paint job was terrible and I even added Floetrol to the paint!! When the paint dried it looked and felt like an ""orange peel"". I ended up taking this sprayer back to the store for a refund. Disappointed to say the least :o("
1,Careful - doesn't work with latex...,"The box doesn't say it does latex (""Stains, sealers, enamels""), so technically, Wagner isn't a total sleeze. Of course, when I walk the paint aisles of HD or Lowes, 90% of the paints are latex, so its an easy mistake to make. It's possible to get it to spray latex, but its slow and spatters a lot.Come on Wagner, be more forthcoming - put a big warning on the box ""NOT FOR LATEX PAINT.""One more return for you...."
1,"Guess what ...you really can't use oil base paint, either!","I thinned and thinned my oil base primer until it would finally spray and using it on some bare wood new eaves, I could have put ten coats on to get good coverage...worse yet, the oil base paint was next to impossible to clean out of it without a big tank of Mineral Spirits or something. There is no possibility that I was able to clean it well enough to use any other color than the white I started out with. I bought an extra front end for it, too! Might as well have thrown the money away...no wonder you see so many Wagner sprayers in Second Hand stores!Avoid this product unless you want to use it for stain."
1,Useless,"Like the other reviewer mentioned, this thing simply won't work with latex paints; even though they're mentioned in the manual. Nothing is more despicable than a manufacturer being deliberately deceitful. Buyer beware!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this to paint a ceiling. I called the support line and they said it was not for latex paint. It does not say that anywhere in the manual. I was told that I might be able to thin the paint, and it might work by the associate on the phone. I did that, and it worked great for about 15 minutes. Then, the sprayer motor just shut down and stopped working. I called the support line again and was told that someone would be with me in 2 minutes but after 10-15 minutes of being on hold I hung up. This was a very frustrating purchase and experience with the support team."
5,GREAT VIEWING,"I JUST GOT THIS DVD AND IT IS GREAT.THE STORIES ARE AS FOLLOWS.THE INTERROGATORS-STEED AND TARA VS AN EVIL MASTERMIND KILLING AGENTS INFORMERS WILL TARA SPILL THE BEANS..THE ROTTERS- STEED AND TARA INVESTIGATE A VERY BAD CASE OF DRY ROT...INVASION OF THE EARTHMEN- STEED AND TARA ARE HUNTED THROUGH A BIZZARE SCHOOL FULL OF PITS,KILLERS AND DEADLY TUNNELLS.KILLER-TARA TAKES A HOLIDAY AND STEED GETS A NEW ASSISTANT WHO CAN MORE THAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.THE MORNING AFTER- STEED AND A MAN HE IS TRYING TO PUT INTO CUSTODY MUST TEAM UP TO SAVE A DESERTED TOWN...AND TARA IS PUT TOO SLEEP!!THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE COUNTLESS CLUES- STEEDS FREINDS ARE BEING FRAMED FOR MURDER SOON IT IS STEEDS TURN ..THE VICTIM A INCAPACITATED TARA..I LIKED THESE ONES ALL ARE VERY INTERESTING BUY THIS NOW."
2,I can't believe I bought this book,"In a nutshell, let's just say I had very high hopes for Lee, an author I'd never read but heard good things about. This book was really awful. The dialogue was stilted, the plot plodded along, and like another reviewer pointed out, the ending was really just ridiculous. I guess I was just fed up of waiting for the new Stephen King to come out (thank God that's over.)"
4,Classic Lee horror and shock,"A very down and out Air Force dischargee is given a chance of a lifetime. Having been dishonorably discharged after being raped by the Colonel's son and now homeless, Clare is offered a position as security chief at a small quasi-government lab in the wilds of Florida.Add to the mix an archeologist trying to prove the existence of a lost Indian tribe that practiced human sacrifice, add a dash of Lee's unbridled ability to show the dark side of human nature, then a good dollop of mutations and you have a gripping horror novel not for the faint of heart (although true fans of Edward Lee could hardly be described as faint of heart).I won't give away the ending, but if you like Edward Lee, you are going to love this one."
4,Stay out of dark caves!,"I read this book and found myself wanting to get back and read more. This writer's style is good and in this novel, his characterization is great. The characterization more or less carries the novel. Not five stars, though. I thought the conflict, which I won't mention here to spoil it for potential readers, is a more than an overworked conflict. Good writing, though. Never a dull moment. Worth a read. I start reading many books and put down many after the first ten or so pages. I read this one through. A strong four stars!"
5,"Fits my 2"" ball perfectly. Functions as expected.","I use this to cover my tow ball when I remove my hitch ball mount when I store my ball mount inside the truck. I use a LED brake light when I am not towingBully CR-025 LED Hitch Brake LightThis cover keeps the greased ball (Permatex 81981 White Lithium Grease, 12 oz. Aerosol Cancovered and keeps my trucks interior clean. I no longer have to wipe the ball clean for storage and then regrease the ball each time.I have no use for the ""4-way flat wiring mounting pocket to keep connector from the weather"", as the connector is part of the trailer and if you have this cover on, you are not connected the trailer....unless I am missing something?Overall, functions exactly as needed for my purpose and the price is right.Dan"
5,Great reference for beginners,"I bought this book halfway through doing a nail technician course and I found it fantastic. Great tips and hints, gives good advice and explains everything clearly.My favourite parts were the trouble-shooting pages with explanations for common problems and how to solve them. There are also good sections on learning to be a trainer, nail art and entering competitions.If you are a complete beginner like me then this book is perfect."
3,Misleading sleeve notes,"This cd claims to be a live recording of Merman's nightclub act recorded in 1964. In fact it is the soundtrack of her 1965 BBC TV special An Evening With Ethel Merman, recorded in London; clips of which can be found on Youtube.Still, worth having if you are not the lucky owner of a copy of that show.The real scoop here is the 'bonus' track, a Merm rehearsal of I Get a Kick Out of You from the last year of her life, proving she still had it right to the end."
1,Can't review what I haven't heard (had to assign rating),"I would like to review this CD, but Amazom has been stringing me along since mid-May 2004 with delay after delay in shipping. Still haven't received the CD, and according to Amazon, I might not get it before mid-October. The only thing I can review is Amazon's service and I rate it 0 stars!!!!"
2,Another Blues Sell Out,"Tone Cool has taken another great, honest blues artist and made them overly commercial by infusing rock and roll. ""Times They Are A Changing"" was a great blues CD, very close to the live performance I saw in September. Sure, BA has some rock tendencies, like his Dad did, but he had stayed true to the blues idiom up until this label switch. I give this CD 2 stars because I just can't get into it. If you are an EC or JH fan, then you would probably enjoy, but if you are a blues purist, better look elsewhere."
3,Stringbag,"Interesting account of flying the Swordfish, but the story is more about the author and has very little to do with flying other than ""we went here and then there""."
1,Lamb kills the book with a stringbag,"Got about half way through and tossed it. Lamb writes like an 19th Century British hack writer. All things have the same level of importance. Whether its his uniform, a sand storm, attacking the Italians, or someone killed in action. It just drones on and on and at the same level. No excitement and no disappointment, just a flat brainwave of a book. He makes things up as he goes along: Red swastikas on Ju 87s, German invasion of Bulgaria forcing Bulgarian pilots to flee. If he cannot get the basics correct, how can one trust anything else he writes.I love the subject matter, WW-2 and the Swordfish, but Lamb engages in writing that has the effect of a story intended to put kids to sleep."
1,CONSUMMATE CLAPTRAP,"More so than the pedestrian writing style of the author that insults the intelligence of the reader I am appalled that over half of the reviewers of this paean of self-adulation are either employees, relatives, or those that have taken the author's staging seminar.The whole book could be condensed to one sentence: Present your product (home) as if you were a prospective buyer."
3,husband wanted,haven't watched yet as we have other dvds to watching first not my kind of movie but will try watching
3,One of the Two was Bad,"After about a week of game crashing and mere frustration, I ended up using MS memory testing on each stick individually to find out one of the sticks was bad. Had to send back at my expense to the company directly via RMA, and am currently awaiting processing which came with a wonderful note ""Please note we are currently experiencing delays with warranty replacement shipments, please allow for an additional 5 business days for processing.""Well known company, but can be merely frustrating to buy new and still have to go through this."
5,Simply the best in a class by himself.,"Gordon was the best baritone, in my opinion, to ever sing a note. This is a wonderful album, and I recommend purchasing."
5,The album that got me into indie,"While the Weakerthans themselves are not really ""indie"" music, ""Left and Leaving"" can provide a gateway to enjoying that particular genre. This album is straight up genius. From the opening chords of Everything Must Go to the closing whisper of Slips and Tangles, ""Left and Leaving"" entrances the listener. It has everything from gentle folk (Everything Must Go, History to the Defeated)to crunchy punk-like guitar (Aside, Watermark) to introspective ballads (Left and Leaving, This is a Fire Door). This is definitely one of my 'desert island' cds, and I wouldn't consider going anywhere without it."
4,Good so far,"When the item arrived, there appeared to be oil leaking out of the unit and the inside of the box had a large oil stain. So far it has not seemed to be a problem.I got this to partially drain my pool for winterization. I have only used it once but it did the trick. It took a while but there is only so much volume you can push through a garden hose size opening."
3,Nothing really new with this ELP release:,"Although the low price looks enticing, this ELP compilation set really doesn't present anything incredibly outstanding. Most of these extended tracks can be heard on the 1974 ""Welcome Back My Friends To The Show That Never Ends"" concert disc. I just bought this special edition album, and ""Piano Improvisations"" by Keith Emerson, a highly allegro version of his ""Piano Concierto #1"" from ""Works Vol. I"", was the only track that made this set worthwhile.Buy at your own risk..."
2,Indian Basketry,This book was in no way helpful to identifying baskets and that was why I bought it. The book was over my head.
2,Not as good as Belkin's or Sumajin's but cheaper,"The old saying, ""you get what you pay for"" rings true again. Though these cable wraps are much cheaper than Belkin's or Sumajin's, it's obvious they're not made as well as those either. They are more of a soft plastic rather than the hard rubber material of the competition. Plus you can see the mold forms on the edges. I kept them and use them a wraps of the excess string from my venetian blinds. If you want something to add flare to your ipod or iphone I would pay the extra and get Belkin's wraps."
1,Not that great.,"This damaged my Apple iPod headphones.The holes that you slide the earbuds into are too small and they opening is closed on one side. When I pressed my earbuds into the holder, the tightness of the hole kept the air from escaping and pushed in the thin plastic diaphragm inside of the earbuds causing the earbuds to sound distorted.To top it off this wrapper doesn't help prevent strain on the cord, and when you do wrap your earbuds around it the whole creates a large bundle in your pocket.Do yourself a favor and just learn to wrap the earbuds properly and forget gadgets like this. The technique I use and which has always worked for me is to hold my first two fingers apart in a ""peace sign"" and wrap my cord around them starting at the headphone end. When I have 2 inches of cord left, I slide them off of my fingers give the looped cords a quarter twist and wrap the last 2 inches of wire around the twist once or twice, tucking the plug through the loop not occupied by the earbuds."
1,Poor quality & design,"I originally was looking for a replacement for my Belkin winders which I lost. These ended up being a poor substitue after alot of research. The price is right, however, the design did not adequately secure my iphone earpieces and after a month they ripped. The Belkins are more durable. Hope this helps."
3,nice pictures,I bought this book as a gift for a friend who likes knights. It is a nice little book and has some fun pictures in it :)
1,amazing !,"It really is amazing how far a talentless buffoon can get with ridiculous dress and tireless self-promotion . I mean , I know this guy , and he's a real loser from the old days . But , if people want to waste their money - go for it!"
4,Great Addition to the ipod,"I bought this and I have to admit is was a little weary. There were alot of different reviews out there. I finally decided to buy one and its great. It was very easy to use and find a radio station to use. It works great in the car with very good quality. There is only a faint hissing sometimes as songs change. I find also that in order to use it on a home radio the ipod has to be very close to the radio. Those are my only complaints, but it is still a great product."
5,the best one,"Forget about all that golden compilations. ABBA is more, and I have discovered it reciently. In my opinion, Super Trouper is not the best ABBA album. Neither Arrival is it. And yes, The Visitors is much better than lot of people thinks.But the best ABBA album is this one, regulary dismissed as the disco album: Voulez-Vous. Epic tunes, some funky, some ice melodies, some dated string arrangemenes and that two incredible voices... an irresistible and exotic mix for this XXI ears tired of grunge, post-grunge and progressive metal (and I also like that, can you believe). Give this a chance. Try to buy the last Dream Theater CD together with this one (as I did) and look at the boy from the shop's eyes.You may not say it to your friends, but you'll probably listen this more than the Dream Theater one..."
3,"A lot of technique, not so much heart","When people think of Abba as a disco band, this is the album they think of. There's a lot to like on it (without mentioning the sublime Chiquitita), but most of the tracks (Kisses of Fire, Lovers Live a Little Longer) sound like they should have been on their first album and not one so close to the brilliant Super Trouper. The techinque is there but not the heart. However, the great If It Wasn't For the Nights, is well worth the price of admission."
5,Joyful :),"""Rivers of joy"" is another track taken from No Angels' debut. It has got all features every hit must have: melody, catching chorus, perfect production.There are 3 versions of title song (radio mix; extended - the best of all three; stage mix - kind of ""live"" mix, not so appealing). Moreover we get another mix of their first hit ""Daylight in your eyes"". The ""Re-supreme remix"" is less energetic than the original, but it doesn't mean it's a failure. I would call it a ""chill-out variation"" :)Definitely good.And for all the fans a little candy in the shape of a ""What am I supposed to do"" - not released before, R&B; track. Cool!Very good release."
2,"Beautiful Photographs, Misinformed Words","The photographs of Audrey Hepburn are (of course) beautiful, but the text accompanying them lacks both beauty and integrity. Factual errors appear from beginning to end - starting with Audrey's birthname and ending with her burial site (she was born Audrey Kathleen Ruston, not Edda Hepburn, and buried in the cemetery in the Swiss town where she lived, not on her own property there - see son Sean Ferrer's book for accurate facts). The sad facts of Audrey Hepburn's life were also exaggerated in the text, as if her charm and elegance are not interesting enough. By all accounts, people who knew Audrey, however, never had a negative word to speak of her. While the photographs in this book do justice for Audrey Hepburn's beauty, the inaccurate and poorly written text is disappointing."
2,A Wannabe Lestat?,"The problem with this book is that in trying to provide a scientific plausibility for the existence of vampires, it sticks too closely to Anne Rice's model: It almost comes across as a propaganda piece for her Chronicles (she has also authored several other books relating to Rice's works).Ramsland only seems concerned with the Anne Rice literary model of vampire, turning it into something almost like a comic book superhero more suited to the ""X-Men"" than any kind of creature with the supernatural trappings that make vampires interesting in the first place.A fairly useless book for vampirological research and one for the Vampire Chronicles completist only."
1,Another Waste of my Time!!!,"I love horror movies, but this one sucked! You find out later that the whole movie never happened, then toward the end...it does happen, if you can make any sense out of that! I would not recommend THE LEGEND OF BLOODY JACK!!!"
3,''bloody jack '',"Another horror movie from the asylum, this one claims to '' recall the raw savage horror of the texas chainsaw massacre and the last house on the left, and to be a modern day 70's horror classic"""".I give it 3 and a half stars.the movie was'nt to bad ,and the acting was ok."
5,Delving into the world of political manipulations,"Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight For UFO Science is the amazing biography by Ann Druffel of a man who crusaded and nearly accomplished the critical scrutiny of UFOs through the eyes of mainstream scientific inquiry. Delving into the world of political manipulations and trade-off deals, as well as outlining the immense effort involved in getting people merely to take notice, Firestorm is a fascinating life study which is most especially recommended reading for any UFO Studies enthusiast."
4,Biography of the Most Influential UFO Investigator,"Very good book. However, the author is perhaps presumptuous in reckoning that he committed suicide. If that were the case, then where are his valuable pocket notebooks? It could be that he had taken them from his office to show someone on the day he died. In vol 2 of his Forbidden Science journals, Jacques Vallee reports that Flying Saucer Review reporter and later editor (and MI6 spy) Gordon Creighton considered that McDonald had been killed.It's an annoying book at times in that I wondered why McDonald did not realise the perilous position he was putting himself in. As an atmospheric physicist, was he unaware of the circumstances of Wilhelm Reich's trial, imprisonment and death? In addition, Ruppelt and Frank Edwards died of untimely heart attacks. The book does a good job in conveying the atmosphere of rising paranoia of the late 1960s/early 70s with regard to UFO investigation, including issues such as suspected CIA penetration of NICAP."
3,well written,"This text covers a broad range of topics in the current forefront of research related to DFT. These include van der Waals forces, polarization, calculations for excited states, and non-local corrections."
5,"You can go home again, sort of...","Not your average family, but who has one? Fun movie with a family that has lots of personalities, and lots of love too. Great mix of characters, and comfortable to watch. Don't expect, just enjoy. A nice winter, Saturday afternoon watch. I enjoyed it very much. I laughed at the aunt, and felt the granddaughter was too much of a brat, the sister was a snob, and Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny self. The mom and dad were believably accepting of the lifestyles of their children, and that was nice. The scene toward the end when Holly Hunter joins her dad who is watching home movies made me miss my parents and wish I could join them for one more holiday.I liked this film, and recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like they are kind of ""home again""."
1,Absolutely Awful.,"Don't bother wasting your time or money on this. Whoever produced this awful album should never be let near another Madonna album, recording studio and child. It sounds like a recording of a couple of 10 year olds singing along to a bad Asian karaoke DVD. I don't know about anyone else, but the idea of kids singing adult themed lyrics about ""Burning Up"" in lust creeps me out. I shudder at the thought of Kids SingN Rap. ""A"" for awful, ""D"" for Don't even go there."
2,Shoulder straps,"Product seems to be of adequate quality, arrived on time, and for the right price.....but, unfortunately they're made in China."
4,"Great book, content touching, relative to my life experience.","The pictures were good & stories relative to life.Sometimes difficult to hear but ""true to go"", funny,sensitive, mature, informative. I laughed & cried."
5,Great purchase,Product received on time and in perfect condition. Would not hesitate to purchase again from this seller.
1,Don't buy them,I so much wished these cookies were delicious but instead I found them dry and hard. And to add to that they bothered my stomach.I would very much rethink ordering them and instead buy another product. I hope the seller will credit my account and not make mereturn them and have to pay for shipping them back. Sorry I really did want to like them but I would not recommend them to anyone.
1,Picture is a throw off,Don't let the size of the ring in the picture intimidate you it is not really that big and shiny and the sellers are horrible they wont take back the product no matter what they're guarantee really says...The ring is nice if you plan on giving it to a little girl but the size of the diamond is SUPER TINY! not worth the price AT ALL!
5,Question!!!!!!!!!!!,"That's the song that made me buy this. I heard it on the radio a few weeks ago after not hearing it for over 20 years. Go Now and then Nights in White Satin came to mind, I downloaded it and listened to it everywhere for over a week, giving it a break until I get the tunes out of my head lol.Really though, Question sounds as fresh as it did way back then (was it 1970?)Loved it, will keep on playing it too!"
3,The Best of the Moody Blues,"Does not sound like the ""old"" recordings I have - instrumentation is different and not necessrily better."
4,and a Half Stars...All the Hits & a Bit More,"During the Nineties there was a Moody Blues collection released for every budget. This is the best single-disc collection. [Don't even think about the recently released 20th Century Masters CD!] You get all ten of the Moody Blues' U.S. hits--including ""Go Now,"" which was inexplicably left of the Time Traveller box set. Plus you get Justin Hayward's gorgeous ""Forever Autumn"" from the soundtrack to Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds. If all you need are the hits, this will do nicely. If you're looking for more, but don't want to spring for the box set, consider the 2-CD The Moody Blues Anthology."
2,Dont rent just from seeing the cover,"I rented this because it had a cool cover and thought it would have some good gore. It starts out good, but it just got dumb middle to the end. The nudity isnt anything special. The gorest parts are when a guy gets shot in the head and blood gets on a white door. The shootout at the end was laughable. They shoot pistols and a shotgun and it takes like 2 seconds to hit something. This reminded me of Rest Stop since that had an awesome cover and had potential, but totally sucked.I just noticed that The Asylum made this, but it looks like a Lionsgate movie."
3,Pretty but catches hair,"I like the price, and the chain looks lovely, but my hair gets caught and tangled in it, so until I find some solution for that, I can't really wear it very often. I have had it for months now and it has not turned green or black, and the gold did not fall off, and it did not get kinked up. It still looks as beautiful as the day I got it. It just yanks my hair out when I wear it :("
2,KInks too easily,"This chain kinks (permanently) too easily, which makes it sit funny. I originally bought it to replace another chain, but I am very dissatisfied with this chain. I would not recommend this product."
5,A solution for any mood swing,"Mmmm...deep house. A CD set for pretty much any situation -- roadtrips, house parties, even paper writing...among other things. Beats that suck you in and don't let go until you turn off the repeat function. Track #7: Dom Dom Jump is mad hype, and of course there's always some talking about Frank Sinatra."
1,Wrong watch arrived...!!!,Amazon shipped wrong color casing watch in this style...sent black casing instead of brushed steel.....sent back...still awaiting reimbursement..
3,"okay product, but slow and expensive delivery","The pillow cover was slightly small for my product so I have not ultimately used it, however the quality of the pillow cover was fine.The cost of shipping was excessive and it took a bit of time to get to me."
4,back saver!,This saved my back and my knees during the last few months of pregnancy. It wasn't so big that it took up too much of the bed.
1,How could Collectables mess up again??,"Out of 17 tracks, only one of them, When Liking Turns To Loving, appears in true stereo on the cd. all others have been folded down to mono, even where collectables issued them in stereo in the past, many of these songs were never even available in mono! Add Love has the begining cut off and the it to drag on because of the recording being slowed down quite a bit for the cd while it's supposed to be a fast uptempo song. I do not recommend this cd to anyone! Any of the other Ronnie Dove cds available, except for the one on Laurie Records, would sound better than this one."
5,Great book for people who really want to understand PHP,"Most of the PHP books I have suffer from simply being a ""monkee see, monkee do"" approach to PHP. You can't really learn PHP from them, when you use them you end up not really knowing anything about PHP and can't go much beyond canned scripts. Gilmore's book (which I was led to by his great articles on his web) is diffferent, when you finish it, you will really understand PHP and can use it really effectively. I have half a dozen books on PHP and this is my favorite."
3,OK but very inconsistent and far from his best,"Like most of his acoustic albums, there are a few classics here (Don't Think Twice, and Girl From the North Country), several good songs (Blowin' In the Wind, Hard Rain), but more losers here than usual (Masters Of War - so dated, Down the Highway, Bob Dylan's Blues, Oxford Town, Talkin' World War III Blues, Corrina, Corrina, Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance and I Shall Be Free all pretty much stink). Much better places to start are Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited, Bringing It All Back Home, Times They Are A Changin (for an acoustic album), Blood On the Tracks, or any of the many really good compilations - just too many losers here."
5,"Which came first--Dylan, or the Sixties?","I'm a kid of the late eighties/early nineties, and even I cannot resist the greatness of this album. I love the understated wit of ""Talkin WWIII Blues,"" with that spectacular off-the-cuff attitude, and the line ""Good car to drive/After a war!"" And of course the immortal ""Masters of War,"" with its almost too-intense delivery and the unrelenting, unblinking gaze he casts upon the horror.Then there's the heartbreaking ""Girl from the North Country"" and ""Don't Think Twice""--how can one artist fit so many awesome songs on one album? It has every emotion, every insight, jewel-like and diamond hard. Unadulterated brilliance."
5,walking music,"This album made me cry, smile, and laugh within a span of twenty minutes. That about sums it up."
1,Mostly Useless,"Bought 3 of these, and they are all useless. They just don't connect properly. Screwed them on with pliers, but still not tight enough to prevent signal distortion and dropping. Cheap, but still a waste of money."
2,End broke off. Had to buy a new one.,"The one of the screw ends fell off within a couple of weeks of using it, making it essentially useless. Very frustrating."
2,Just Ok.,"The product itself is ok. The connectors are a little flimsy. The images on the TV also came up a little snowy at times, until I adjusted the cable. As it gets the job for the most part, and was extremely cheap (in price), I am satisfied. However, if you want a hassle free experience, I would recommend purchasing a different cable.In terms of service, shipping has super fast. I selected standard shipping and the product arrived the next day. Also, the items were properly packaged."
1,falls apart,"This product did not attach securely when screwed in, and wouldn't tighten. I had to readjust the contact point often to avoid static and interference. Finally the cable just separated from the screw portion and there was no way to put them together. Buy something else."
4,hdtv installer,Works well as advertised. Although the specs are not detailed enough. Did some research and all I could find is that this coax cable has a copper center conductor. Hope this helps.
1,Not a good choice,"I had problems with my comcast service and they sent a technician for help. He said that the problem was with the cable. He said the cable didn't have enough strength to ""transfer high flux"".. He replaced it with a comcast cable and the internet's working fine now."
1,Doesn't Fly,"THUNDERBIRDS was a childhood favourite of countless youngsters growing up; unfortunately, none of the actors in this lamentable reboot look anything like their storied counterparts who created the roles on the original series, leaving many a fan hanging his head and wondering what MIGHT have been..."
4,Thunderbirds still go!,Here I am at 47 years old with an 8 and 10 year old enjoying the Thunderbirds all over again. I'm sad it did not do better at the box office. But what do you expect from a very good movie that all of the family can go and see. This is not what movie critics are going to push with good reviews.I had a great time watching the original series and this remake was fun too. What was wholesome back then still is good viewing today. Buy the DVD when it comes out.
3,definitely worth seeing,"I wasn't a fan of the cartoon when it was aired. However, this live action movie of the Thunderbirds was entertaining and had some very good life lessons in it (I won't spoil the movie by stating the good life lessons). There was one noticeable blooper (at least only one to a person who doesn't know the story line), the clear line used to make props float was visible in a shot in the cockpit of T-bird 2. Otherwise, the script and action is a little hokey but still entertaining. The main thing I would have changed would have been to focus on the entire Tracy family, not just the youngest son."
3,The show just seems unfinished,"Before you Berserk fanatics start complaining about the score, let me just say that Berserk really is a wonderfull anime, and one of the best series of all time. The show includes a surprisingly rich story, which is also quite dark for a TV show. Unfortunately, after watching an imported DVD set, it seems that the series' producers spent more resources than necessary on the first episodes, and didn't quite realize that the story needed to fit in a single TV season.The reason I say that is because they left a HUGE gap in the storyline. The story does reach an ending, but some very important pieces of the storyline were skipped.A series with such high production values should not have this sort of problem. Thankfully the manga includes what was left out. In fact, I hope that someone picks up the manga and decides to continue producing this wonderful series. A story this good deserves a more complete series."
2,Didn't hold my interest,"I rented this some months ago and am now trying to remember it. It did not hold my interest, had a hard time staying awake, kept waiting for something to happen. The characters all seemed rather cardboard and the plot did nothing to get me hooked and wanting to seem more. I would not buy this or any other Berserk DVD, I would not even rent the rest."
2,A Little Disappointed.,"I purchased Haven and Damage Done at the same time and have been banging my head to Damage Done<which I review on that album separately> but just could not get into Haven, and believe me I consider myself an open-minded metal-head and gave this album several listens. I just didn't like the direction they went on this album, kinda like a riffy-tech metal based around keyboard kinda sound, and the vocals in some areas sounds like Rammstein. It just seemed to me they were trying to go a little more commercial on this one, but in the process they lost some of there balls. On a positive note I did like 'Feast of Burden' and 'Rundown' and DEFINITELY wish they would have gone more in THAT direction but unfortunatly two good songs don't make a five star album. 2 stars definitely."
4,Sailing down Ocean Drive,"'Ocean Drive' is my favorite of the Lighthouse Collection. I bought this album after having first listened to 'Whatever Gets You Through The Day.' Being a debut album, I expected it to sound unfinished, boy was I wrong. I was surprised though that not many of my friends had heard of these guys, because they're great! Pick it up and enjoy."
5,"Inspiring, Revolutionary, and unique","The first time that I heard Ocean Drive by the lighthouse family at Heathrow Airport, I knew that this dynamic duo would be one of the most inspiring acts that England would have to offer the music world. With the release of their second album, Postcard from Heaven, I strongly believe that time has proved me right. It's amazing how the United States doesn't seem to catch up with the music of Lighthouse Family. It is really our loss!"
4,Needed A Kickstart,"When this album was first released in the Uk it didn't really have any impact until the single Lifted was released for the second time, and then we went mad. Lighthouse Family have a crisp new sound that is upbeat yet laid back at the same time. Ocean Drive contains the singles Ocean Drive, Lifted, Lovin Every Minute and Goodbye Heartbreak. This is a good album to chill out to and several years later this cd is still a resident in my player"
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME TOTAL GARBAGE!,I am a fan of the original Freaks. This movie is grade Z garbage. It is a total snooze fest until the gross-out ending which is not even as bad as the description would lead you to believe. The whole thing feels like a really bad porn movie with totally cardboard performances. The ending which could be really horrorific is ruined because the victim is barely reacting to the nasty torturous revenge that is bestowed upon her. One of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've seen a lot!
2,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME","I had been waiting for 2 years to watch this when I finally got the chance. Everyone of my friends who watched it said it was disgusting and vulgar. Well, until the last five minutes, it completely sucked. The acting was horrible, the costume designer didn't do well at all, the writer's didn't do well, and the main plot was SEX. This movie was a waste if time and if you want to see the original, it is called Tod Browning's Freaks. It is 10 times better than this modernized piece of crap version"
2,Not for Vegans,"Such a disappointment - although the book looks good and contains wonderful information about specific grains, sadly the majority of recipes contain milk or eggs and/or and honey and/or include meat, so it doesn't work for vegetarians or Vegans. it will have to go back."
5,Beautiful Shoe,I positively loved this shoe. It is to me the most beautiful shoe that J Renee has made. I love when the lights reflect the beautiful colors and the shoe is very comfortable. Love it........
5,AWESOME,I wondered if I could find this old school CD but leave it to Amazon who has never disappointed me. This is a LTD classic. No need to say any more....
1,SHOCKINGly boring,"For all of the hoopla expressed in this documentary's description I have to say I expected a pace much faster and cuts that weren't so excruciatingly slow in coming. The doc seems to have no structure or timeline, and the inclusion of Joe Coleman was just fodder that drags this further with no discernable contribution. Using film footage from future decades was sloppy and rotating the same handful of pictures was boring. No, it wasn't the frankness of the crime, or the gore that was painted (literally), it was the amaturish editing, melodramatic narrative, and slow pace that made me eject this of the way through. I pity anyone who rents this thinking a well-produced documentary with new revelations is in store."
2,Why didnt they follow the manga...,"What happened to the Kenshin saga?? The kyoto arc ended and in the manga the Jinchuu arc was not complete. So they made fillers. The shimabara arc (if you can even call it an arc since it only lasts a few episodes long) is about another Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu master (ok........) who is christian. Some boring sh** happens and he and kenshin end up dueling it out in the most unexciting final battle ever.I really wish they would have waited for the manga to finish. Even Nobuhiro Watsuki (RK's creator) was wondering why they gave it the Shimabara theme. At anime expo 2002 he was asked what he thought about the filler episodes, and he wondered why they couldnt do something more interesting, like make kenshin go to America. (That would be pretty funny)Dont waste your money on this. download it at the most."
2,lee,Excellent price but you pay for what you get. I purchased this for very limited use with my television when quiet in the room is needed. It works fine for my needs but quality is limited.
1,Not Black Band Candles,These are advertised as Housewarmer/Black Band candles they are not.They have a pour date of 2011.I purchased these for that reason. Housewarmer candles are no longer made by yankee candle and usually have a great throw.These are being returned.Thanks for the false advertising.
1,"Fact or Fantasy, who knows?","I remember when I was in school and I had to do an oral book report but hadn't read the book. I would bravely make stuff up and hope the teacher hadn't read the book either. I think that Mr. Lackmann hopes you haven't read anything on the bios of the people in his book because many times he's full of it. As fantasy this book is entertaining. As fact it's like the Twilight Zone, you never know where you're headed."
4,Love on the run,"Blanche, the local school teacher, and Teresa, a dance hall girl, meet and develop a deep friendship. When Teresa decides to leave town, Blanche decides to go with her, despite the fact that it's supposed to be her wedding day. As they flee across the plains, they discover their feelings go beyond friendship. They also discover they are being hunted by the man who owned the saloon Teresa worked in. Can they reach safety in a place where they can live their lives as they want and he can't find them?"
5,Sturdy - gets the job done,"These felts are what you'd expect from the excellent cymbal manufacturer - sturdy, well-constructed and serve their purpose very well. No complaints here."
4,"Great disk, but...","it is very sad that this is the last disk of Magic Users Club. My friends and I have looked forward to each dvd as they came out, after my friend picked up the first disk at an anime convention. If you haven't seen this series, it is great! And the best part is the outtakes.. So, saddness abounds as we come to the last dvd of this great anime."
3,good but not the best,"sublime elctronic futuristic jazzy lounge, sometimes kinda deep house, excellent. A little too much saccharine syrupy vocals (male & female) appearing on every other track which gets annoying, but doesn't ruin the whole CD, just makes it mediocre."
4,RELAXING BACKGROUND MUSIC,I ENJOYED THIS CD VERY MUCH. IT MAKES NICE BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR DINNER & DURING THE DAYTIME.
2,its more for the little kitties... to cheesy!,"The story is ok(when compared to other great anime like ""cowboy beebop"") and so is the little action scenes they do have(which is only 10% of the sereis). But character personalites and dialoge scenes (which constitutes 90% of the sereis) are so BORRING and repetative. they keep asking the same melow dramatic question answeard with the same melow dramatic, cheesy lines.THE FIRST FOUR DVD'S OF THE SERIES WERE UTERLY BORRING AND USELESS, ID NEVER WATCH THEM EVER AGAIN! the animation is pretty WEAK except for the actions scenes which are rare. Buy Cowboy Beebop instead"
4,"Great anime, bad ending...... really really bad ending!","I finished watching the whole collection. The story is great! Loved the characters and the animation. The story is original and intresting. The plot.... well that has yet to be seen. the last 2 eps completely ...! What the heck happened I really don't know... Though the rest of the series minus the last 2 eps is really great. Hopefully the 2 movies coming out will give some closure to the whole series. If I didn't mention it before, in the collection there is no ending. Leaves you completely hanging with some lame, abstract psycho babble in the last 2 eps, go figure! Just so you know from what I hear the movies that are coming out still don't give you closure. Hey I'm still gonna get them cause I just have to know for sure. I say it was worth getting the collection even though there was no ending and what ending it does have makes no sense. I suggest you borrow or rent and if you like it buy it to add to your anime collection."
3,not as good as they tell you.,"1. You will get totally hooked on this series but the ending will really dissapoint you.2. You will then buy the movie ""Death and Rebirth"" which will still dissapoint you.3. Then you will buy the second movie ""End of Evangelion"" and you will be blown away.So as a stand-alone series without the movies Evangelion is pretty good. The ending is very ""origional"" and often disliked. You would pay [$$$] buying them all separatly.I've heard that the first disk has been remastered or something but the series's animation is top-notch anyway and it doesn't make sense to remaster only one disk in a set so I doubt it."
4,Evangelion,"I purchased the Evangeilion Perfect Collection for my brother as a Christmas gift. He like it very much. My only concern for this purchase was the delivery. I tracked this package from my workplace on the day of delivery and it showed that it had been delivered and left at my front door. This had me worried as I have a locked gate completely surrounding my building. When I got home I went on a search for the package and found that it had been thrown over the 7 ft gate right into a water puddle. It sat there in the water puddle for about 5 hours. Luckily, the item was not damaged, but it made me very angry that your choice of courier would treat my purchase from you so poorly."
2,Buy other collection,"The final quality of image and audio aren't the best, and between cuts from frame to frame, are jumps of image.Listen to me, better buy Evangelion Renewal or Platinum, all the serie is remasterized in audio and image, and has the director cut's..."
1,Great up till the end....,"To give this series credit, it starts off great with a potentially good story line, good animation and great character developement. I would have rated this series with 5 stars if I had not watched the ending and felt like....I just wasted a portion of my life in suspence for that?!!!!"
5,One of the best anime that will keep your mind occupied,"This show is one of the few anime shows that have drawn a large worldwide fan base and spawned tons of discussions everywhere. While this is a worthwhile show to collect, don't buy the Perfect Collection though. Buy the newer Platinum Edition instead. It has a much improved video and updated 5.1 audio, and even include the director's cut episodes. The Platinum Edition is essentially the expensive Renewal set in Japan, but without the two movies and some other extras that ADV Film does not have the licence to. The Platinum Edition consists of 7 separate volumes, with an optional artbox that comes with volume 1."
2,Incorrect description. Does not include TNC/SMA adapter,"Be advised, despite Amazon's description stating: ""comes with TNC SMA adapter for maximum flexibility"", the antenna does not include the adapter. Most newer routers now use R-SMA connections. This antenna has a TNC connector. Antenna is going back to Amazon."
3,"Helpful, but not essential.","This book was purchased as optional course material for a college anthropology course my wife and I took together. It is a study guide and as such does not provide information the the textbook does not, however its organization does assist for test preparation. A person could intently read and study the textbook only and never touch this book and have a good grade but for those students who like that extra insurance of a good grade this study guide does provide another text to study that certainly wouldn't hurt."
4,valuable book,"I have only browsed the book but I am impressed what what I read and am looking forward to applying the methods outlined.I have been using different types of holistic, ""alternative"" therapies for many years and I can tell this has value."
4,A Very Special Christmas,"Order received in a timely manner, well packaged and in good condtition.Thank you."

1,Christmas Drivel,"Except for one or 2 tunes, the rest of this is pure shee-it. Amazing what's considered to be ""talent"" these days. Even the Barking Dogs sound better."
1,"Be wary of this seller....Wheelchairs Plus Mobility Solutions, Inc.","If you buy this product, you are paying 14 bucks for one pack of sponges. The add is extremely misleading, and 14 bucks is about 12 bucks more then you should be paying for them. I was stupid enought to fall for this scam. Yes it contains 5 sponges according to label, but it is a SINGLE USE pack. For the price you think you are getting 5 packs (for a little steep of a price but with free shipping).....BS though the seller is making a killing of wordsmithing."
5,ENTERTAINING AND INFO FILLED,"WELL HONESTLY, I THOUGHT THE VIDEOS IN THE VIDEO WERE CHEESY, BUT I'M ALLOWED TO SAY THAT CAUSE I'M ERIN'S SISTER. I EVEN TOLD HER. THEY ARE SO AWESOME TO WATCH LIVE AND OFCOARSE ON MY OWN HOME VIDEOS. THE REST OF THE VIDEO IS REALLY COOL, LIKE IF YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEM AND YOU WATCHED THE VIDEO, YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU KNEW WHO THEY WERE FOREVER. I LOVE ALL THE GIRLS, THEY ARE VERY PRETTY AND VERY SWEET, AND TO TOP IT OFF THEY ARE ALL AWESOME PERFORMERS, ESPECIALLY MY SISTER BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I TAUGHT HER.HE HE HE. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK GIRLSJEN"
5,No Secrets: Get To Know Us,"You first heard of them through Aaron Carter's hit song, ""Oh Aaron"" where they sing the chorus that caught everyone's attention. Then you heard their version of ""Kids In America"" on the ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Soundtrack"" Now see backstage clips from No Secrets' mall tour, shooting the ""Kids In America"" video, the video, 5 video clips from songs on their upcoming self-titled debut album, interviews and much more so you can get to know these 5 ladies better. Prepare to be blown away by Angel, Carly, Erin, Jade, and Jessica-No Secrets!"
4,Kidz in America 2002,"Watching the No Secrets ""Get To Know Us"" VHS, I thought these 4 girls definitely have what it takes to be successful. Their video is full of great info on Angel, Carly, Jessica, Jade, and Erin. The video lets the viewers hear all the songs from their debut cd, and shows how down-to-earth they really are! No Secrets maybe another pop girl group, but they have a lot of talent and it shows through their DVD/VHS! =)"
3,Solid If Not Spectacular,Whereas this recording is not on the same level as Four it still has many interesting tracks. Many of the songs seem to blur together as the variety has diminished from the previous effort. Still I love those harmonica sounds. For the record I would rate this 31/2 stars but there's no halves here.
4,Excellent Primer on Project Management,"This is an excellent text for indviduals new to project management as well as experienced project managers. While short on advanced project management tools and techniques, the book does provide solid advice and best-practice guidance for achieving project success...well done! One recommendation would be to package a CD with document templates."
4,good train program,"good program , highly recommend it for either trains buffs or just general audiences , professionally done and excellent content"
4,"I got these shoes for $60 in the Harrisburg Mall, Harrisburg PA",I don't know why these shoes are so expensive here. I bought these for $60 a month back!!! What's goin on Amazon??
4,A Great Global Underground Debut,"Danny Howells is the second Nubreed DJ featured in the series. Howells is an innovative and exciting DJ with that extraordinary gift to mix sets that take the electronica fan on journeys using his decks as transport.Both discs are very good in my opinion. Neither are highly innovative, but both work and the end product are two above average sets.Keep your eyes and ears on this guy. He continues to rise in rank on my personal favorite DJ list. Don't miss him live if you ever get the chance.Both disc 1 and disc 2, get 4/5 stars."
5,What's this starlet Tina Arena's name doing on this site?,"This is for comments about Jo Dee's excellent CD, not some unknown, trying hard, starlet's lackluster rise to non-existent fame.Cheers, Jo Dee. Way to go!"
1,I should BURN this worthless album!,"First of all, I don't hate Jo Dee, I just don't care about her and her career. The CD cover reminds me of a battered wife. Anyway, she covers Tina Arena's smash ""BURN"". I have always loved this song, I had so many good times with the original Tina Arena version. Tina's ""Burn"" is special in my life then I heard this singer revived the immortal classic. Jo Dee destroyed the whole spirituality of the song! It gave her an American #2 all because of Tina! Fine! she's had success with this song but she will never make this her own. She gave no justice at all. The rest of the album are common country songs from an old boring woman!"
5,Built like back in the old days.,I bought this triangle as kind of a gag gift for a friend of mines who likes to to cook. Well the trick was on me. These things are heavy and built to last like cast iron pots of old. Their totally cool and now I want one!
1,Oops!....,"You should NEVER considering buying this DVD! It's a complet waste of money! Aaron Carter is just a pretty good looking guy, he is NOT good at singing, he actually suck at singing. He never stop hyperventilating during the WHOLE concert. I can't even listen to what he sing. Absolutely HORRIBLE!!"
3,Tie Bar,"I recieved this tie bar in three days! Very fast service. Unfortunately I did not realize that ""with removable tie bar chain"" meant they would remove it when I bought it. While the tie bar itself is very nice, I bought it as a gift and he really wanted a bar with a chain. Thank you for the speedy service."
2,NOT made by Linear Logic (ScanGuage)!!!,"The cable that I received was made by OBD2CABLES, not Linear Logic, the company that makes the ScanGauge II and E products, even though the listing in a couple of places says that it is ""by ScanGauge"". Now these sort of cables are pretty simple items, so you would think that a non-OEM cable should be just fine... but it would be nice to know that you are buying an equivalent part versus an OEM part. Unfortunately for me, the cable I was sent (from ScanTool, fulfilled by Amazon) has some sort of intermittent problem that seems to confuse my Jeep Cherokee's computer, causing an engine shutdown! I plan to order a genuine ScanGauge OBDII cable directly from Linear Logic. Amazon informed me that ScanTool is the source of the deceptive wording in the item listing, and is allowing me to return the non-OEM cable for a refund."
2,Poor Paint & Brittle Craftsmanship,"The figure in the box doesnt look like the display versions you see in pics from the manufacturer. First, he looks ghoulish, with facial details painted wrong like eyebrows, eyes and the worst and most obvious was the hair was not completely painted around the face which looked absolutely terrible.A basic decent paint job would have been nice but for the over $40 bucks you'll shell out, you would be advised to find a loose one for half or less, if you absolutely have to have it.On craftsmanship, the arm broke off at the elbow joint where you unplug it to plug in the secondary cigar arm supplied with the figure. It was a pain to superglue it back on and at this point I'm not going to try to swap out the arms. Not to mention the lacking articulation points which even older 12 inch figures from years past had. Brittle & dissapointing sums up the craftsmanship."
5,Amsterdam this cd is good.........,If you like Progressive house that will pund you with a classy style this cd is for you...Nick Warren is awsome and this cd is right up there with the best of them... Oh Ya.....worth the buy...He is a great DJ and with every single mix I respect this guy more and more..... ONe of the best Global Undergrounds to date... and one that will be remembered for years to come.......
2,"Really bad from one of my fav DJ, Nick Warren",Maybe its just me but this whole compilation is really boring to listen to. It doesn't pick up at all. Your waiting for it to pick up soon but it just stays flat throughout the whole set both on disc one and disc two. Budapest and Brazil was much much better. Consider this like his chill out album almost touching that barrier. The tracklisting is not bad at all. But the sound quality and mixing is really low. I can compare this to John Digweed's Los Angeles since both are really deep and slow.
2,Not very good at all,"This is a very poor concert. There are only two actually good women singers, the older woman who sings ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" and the young woman who sings ""Wishing you were Somehow Here again"" and the duet of ""All I ask of you"" is actually VERY good, I would definitly listen to her more. Again, there are only one or two half decent male singers ""Sunset boulavard"" for instance. The singers that are also in the chorus who have solos are very bad, the songs ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" ""The Music of the Night"" ""And the money kept rolling in"" ""I don't know how to love him"" ""Memory"" are all just plain bad. If you are really interested, I sudgest trying to find it in your library, it is just not worth paying ANYTHING to buy it."
5,Difficult to find it,"I was very happy to fing the ""Pathetique"" which I missed when releassed. Now I'vecompleten my DVD's on Karajan Tschaikowsky both in DG and Sony. Interesting to compare."
1,Doesn't work at all,I live in Manhattan in a third floor apartment of a five story building. This antenna doesn't work for me at all. I can't even get any channels to come in partially.
1,antenna???,Agh!! Shouldn't I have known better..when an item cost less than the postage your playing with fire...reception is less than poor...mostly non-existent.. Could be the are I live in BUT 4 months without tv..and then this my gift card...might work in the right area..but this was a clear loser for me!!
2,Couldn't get a thing,"I'm only about 10-15 miles from Boston... couldn't even get network stations with this thing. Use it for marshmallow roasting. Oh, wait, it's painted so it's not even good for that..."
1,Antenna does not work,This antenna comes with a coaxial cable that is very flimsy and hard to attach to the TV. I received more channels without it as I could not get any channels with it. Returned for a refund.
2,Didn't work,"To be fair, I only used this one time, on a portable DVD player with TV tuner. However, it did not pick up more than 2 or 3 stations. I'm not a ""Radioshack"" guy, so I can't talk about any of the technical stuff, but my real-world testing says it didn't work for me. Perhaps the item I had it hooked up to also was bad, so it may not be entirely the fault of the antenna, but again, no stations. Returned it. Also returned the portable DVD player..."
4,Best description would be adequate!,"Very adequate for your local stations. It's amazing how you really do not miss the choice of multiple stations. You know what I mean, when you just sit there and scroll through 100's of the channels to see whats on. Time waster! This beats the heck out of paying for my already free stations anyway."
1,This attena only picked up 3 channels I give it a one star only because I can not give it any less.,"My sister bought this antenna to go with the new 19 inch TV that has been installed in our grandmothers assisted living home. all she wants is 9 Which is bay news 9 here. We figured with a modest antenna and a new TV she would get a few channels at least the local news since she lives in winter haven not to far from Tampa she would pick up a good bit of channels Florida being flat and all. One PBS channel and two other channels is all I got even tho the TV says it picked up 6, I played with the ears put the antenna right in the window. and even tho it said 6 it only showed 3. I am less than impressed with this antenna any antenna should pick up a station less than 40 miles away."
5,Worked for me in Memphis!,"The area I live in, in Memphis does not have good satellite reception. I do not have cable currently and so I was not picking up all of the over air digitally broadcast channels.This antenna allows me to do so, when I have problems I just adjust the antenna.I am happy with my purchase."
2,You get what you pay for,"I recently bought a small HDTV that would get only occasional use, making cable impractical. I figured a basic antenna would suffice in a major metropolitan area, but not so. I don't know if it is the antenna or the location, but I can't get more than the local NBC affiliate most times, and we're only ten miles from a major city."
5,Great Reception!,I don't have cable or dish network for my television viewing so when the airways went digital my ability to receive clear channels was decreased. I bought this antenna hoping it would solve that problem and it did! The dial allows for some fine tuning if the weather gets nasty. GREAT PRODUCT!
5,Cost Saver,This antenna has allowed us to get rid of DirecTV and still get over 20 HD channels for free. Wish I would have done this sooner.
2,metal siding,"Someone mentioned metal siding interfering with TV signals. I'm not sure if that is what is hampering my reception, but the antenna did not help me receive any stations any better."
4,It works all right,"This antenna is ok, I can't seem to find one that works perfect. This is probably the best that I have found. Once and a while I have to adjust the antennas which is annoying but for the most part I can just leave it and not make any adjustments. There must be a better antenna out there but this works for me for the little amount of time I spend watching the tube."
3,"Works well, but has some caveats","Like all antennas, it really depends on location. I live in an area where I should get every single station from the metropolitan area around me. And for the most part I do. The adjustment dial is a bit of a challenge, because sometimes you'll get the one station you want, and lose two others. Recently though (without changing the antenna position, this issue has been solved and all major and minor stations come in). But all in all, I don't see a need to spend more on an antenna for over the air. I now have free HD for not much money."
1,Not worth it,"Item doesn't work at all. It might be my apartment, but save your money anyways. It is not worth wasting 12 dollars."
3,just OK,"I have a new Phillips 19'' HDTV, no cable.I got about 10-16 channels with this Antenna, which is not bad, but they are not very stable, especially when I'm really concentrated on a show, the pic become intermittent and the signal suddenly gone completely, this really drives me crazy.....I'm not sure if this is my TV's problem or the orientation of my APT (I place the antenna right by the window).anyway, at least I can still watch the TV, just look at the bright side :-)"
1,disappointed,"actually, the album gets five stars. the dvd only one star since i am able to access the bonus material on either of the two stand alone dvd players that i have. it plays just fine on my mac, but at the end of the day it's not the same. i'm tempted to buy another copy and trade my other one in. we'll see."
4,Micro Stick,"It's pretty good! Got it in a timely matter. Price is good, but S&H is pretty high. I would still buy from this vendor."
5,gratest guitar player on the planet,Well I heard this from an unsual perspective. I have an autographed copy I bought from Tommy Emmanuel after seeing him perform live at the 2000 Walnut Valley music festival in Winfield Kansas. He is an awesome perfomer. The CD is great. This is a guy the late Chet Atkins called the greatest guitar player on the planet. If you like acoustic guitar soloists you have to buy this album.
5,Only is my favorite Tommy Emmanuel CD!,"Tommy Emmanuel manages to squeeze such expression out of a guitar it is truly amazing, and nowhere is this more apparent than in this solo CD. (Hence the ""Only"") A guitar playing friend of mine met Tommy at a guitar convention & let me borrow his autographed copy of ""Only"". I was hooked & immediatly bought a copy. All my friends & family who have heard it have wanted a copy too. I listen to this one a lot and it never seems to get old. If you're into solo guitar mastery & music that is liberating to the soul, this CD is a must for your collection!"
4,Spooooky Book!,"This is such a great book! I was visiting Washington D.C. last summer and got this book. That was a good choice! This book is so AWESOME! It has a lot of stories, and all very well described. It even has black and white photos of the people and places that relate to the stories. This book WILL run chills down your spine, and sometimes I would sit up in bed all night and see if any ghosts would come. Like someone mentioned earlier, the cover of the book is really freaky and spooked me out. This is a great choice for any type of reader."
5,Great controller for street fighter fans,"This arcade style controller is great! I bought it for my bf, and he absolutely loves it. It came with a great collector's box, and a street fighter comic book. I'm already buying the other controllers =]"
5,Pleasing,"I have been collecting this commentary series for quite some time. The books can be a little uneven in content, but this particular book seems to be well thought and provides good information that you would expect or want in a commentary.Pat"
4,Good Read,It is hard to get Biblical books that explain and expound at a lay read. This book is technical but not above those with more than a working knowledge of the Bible.
4,A STEAL !,one or two of the legs didn't match up perfectly...but i can't complain...hardly noticeable anywayan absolute steal for $72 bucks ! ...a little slowshipping but well worth the wait... would recommend.
4,Once Again Le Carre Proves He is at the Top of the Field,"John le Carré proves with this book that he can change like a chameleon for each book and never even break stride. His novels are all different and yet all completely interesting, on so many levels. I love the way he twists your mind around some new conundrum in each novel. I appreciate how he can write something so deep and important like Constant Gardener and yet move on to an equally important book like this, illuminating what is going on in Africa, while staying away from preaching while he is doing it. It is lighter fare, in a way, but then that is being overly simplistic. The protagonist is an innocent and by the end you are almost yelling at the book...""don't do it."" It is a fully engaging novel."
2,slow slogging thru the African mud that just ain't worth the time,"I am a longtime John LeCarre fan, especially the Smiley books. He obviously tries very hard to do justice to the tragedy of recent decades' Congo/ Rwandan history but the resulting novel was sickeningly sticky slow for me. I gave it 2 stars only because of the great effort in writing and respect for the subject LeCarre obviously shows. But if I hadn't known it was a leCarre creation, I'd have tossed it in the waste basket after 30-50 pages. I did at the end (sorry, I didn't want to submit anyone else to the pain) and felt I needed to balance the good reviews with this one. Sorry John, not a good read."
4,I like this band,"I saw the Caulfields in Seattle, WA., years ago (mid 1990's?) and bought their Whirlygig CD at that time. I have REALLY enjoyed it since then - it's one of my fave CD's (I only have around 600 CD's). I've had my eye on this for some time and finally got it. The wit is still there in the writing but I just haven't heard it as many times to grow as fond of it and due to my listening habits now (I don't listen to music as much) I doubt if I'll get the same connection with it as Whirlygig. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I just don't have the connection with it (yet). For a first time buyer, I'd still recommend Whirlygig over this CD."
3,double choc. fountain,"I purchased this fountain for a birthday party. Kids loved it. I have a little cleaning tip I would like to share with you. It is rather difficult to clean, but i found that using a baby bottle and nipple brush does the job well! I can't wait to use this fountain for our future parties! I bought chocleys ""just melt it"" chocolate and I found it to be great tasting and easy to melt! Thanks to the review I saw here"
4,A party favorite!!,"Beautiful piece of equipment. It worked beautifully and the chocolate flow was just right. The only reason, I did not rate this as a 5-star, is for the fact; the motor is louder and not as quiet as i would like, especially for a luncheon and/or party."
5,Comfortable and Protective,"I bought these along with the Protec Park Knee Pads for my wife. They are comfortable to wear for stretches at a time and while we haven't had to 'use' them (so far so good, no falls! lol), she feels much more assured by wearing them. Thanks!"
5,well made mailbox,"This item is made very well. It is heavy duty, with a very nice black matte finish. The door opens and closes easily, with a magnetic closure. This is a great feature to insure that it remains closed in bad weather. The mailbox is a great size. It fits on the standard mailbox street stand, yet has ample room for any mail overflow. I recommend this mailbox highly."
1,King James Version,"I hate to put a bad review on any of God's Word.I bought this Bible as a friend of mine kept asking meto get it. ( she is a dedicated Pentacostal - not a problem with me ). I enjoyed the fact that it was King JamesVersion of the Bible, but was really discouraged that allthe foot notes were TOTALLY from a pentacostal view point.I have studied the word all my life, and was getting greatlydiscouraged and confused, until I searched the beginning of this Bible,and found out why - all pentacostal view points."
2,Not just for women,"I am a man who has been looking for quite awhile to find a masculine looking watch that was proportioned for my scrawny wrist. This slightly smaller version of the men's watch of the same name works for me. It's a very sturdy watch with that handy indiglo feature, too. I didn't give it 5 stars because the date is really too small and, for me at least, the light has to be just right to read it. Overall, I'm very happy with it. UPDATE: After 6 months the calendar stopped working so I'm returning it to Timex for warranty which will end up costing me a handling fee. I've had lots of Timex watches and this is the first one to malfunction so quickly. If they'd had it at the time I got this one, I would have bought the T48501 because it has a little magnifier over the calendar."
4,Great Watch,"I love this watch. It's easy to see and doesn't haven't a bunch of alarms or crazy stuff on it that no one can figure out how to use or turn off. The reason I gave it four stars is that the band doesn't seem as sturdy as it looks. It doesn't feel like leather or suede.It's a great watch though, I love it and I wear it to work everyday."
2,"Disappointed. Watch was nice, just not as described","Watch was nice, just did not have the date display listed in the description. That made me wary of how old it was so I returned it. I can get the watch with the calendar function I wanted somewhere else for a less than $0.50 more."
1,The Committed Life,"After all the praise this book received, I thought it would be ""meatier"". However, it is no more than a tiresome (and at times unbeleivable) account of the Rebbetzin changing peoples lives with flowery words. It just doesn't happen that way. I can hardly believe Dr. Laura Schlessinger gave this book a great review. How can she justify, in the chapter on prayer, beseeching the long dead great grandfathers to ""intercede in front of G-'s holy throne"" to get God to keep her husband from dying. Praying to anyone other than G-d is,in judaism,idolotry. In addition, asking G-d to interced in our affairs, in essence, to ""make it all better"", is self serving and egotistical.G-d can help us to cope with the troubles life puts in our path but it is pure vanity to think G-d will change the world to suit our wants and desires. Is this woman really Jewish?"
1,For Old Ladies only,"This album is just awful. I expected something good considering this is Richard Carpenter but instead got an album that could put an insomniac to sleep. ""Lawrence Welk"" should be stamped in big letters across this album. Carpenter should have received a Grammy nomination for worst album of the year. I haven't been this disappointed since purchasing the Barbra Streisand Christmas album, another bomb. Unless you like old ladies music, don't waste your money on this."
3,"good, but let's hear something new!","nice RE-arrangements of lot's of Carpenters favorites (time to loose the OK Corale Singers), with 2 new titles. Unfortunately, he should use his brilliant arranging skills and get into some new tunes. The old ones, while the arrangements are good, still conjure up Karen's voice and memories of what she might sound like. New songs would help him break away . . ."
1,The Jerk and the Doormat!,The principal male character was a jerk all throughout the story and in the end the principal female character made it too easy for him.
5,Transporting,I had the pleasure of seeing Travis play as Massey Hall in Toronto in the Fall of 2001 and was nearly in tears by the end of the concert. This DVD is the closest thing to being there again. It gives you a feeling of who these guys are and where they're from and why you should listen to them.I constantly put this on in the background if I'm working or cleaning or something and it's like I'm transported to a field on some sunny day in Glasgow with my favorite band playing to the heavens.

4,A humorous and heartfelt stellar freshman effort,"Paul Thorn deftly mixes a back country sensibility, genuine Christian faith and a wicked sense of humor on his bluesy/country album Hammer + Nail. The songs are frequently humorous (try 800 Pound Jesus and an unlisted track Joanie, the Jehovah Witness Stripper) and often passionate pleas to the woman who left him behind (Double Wide Paradise, Temporarily Forever Mine and I Bet He Knows). The songs are well crafted with simple melodies, sung with a gravelly voice peppered with fire. If you're into singers like Johnny Lang, or if you're in touch with your trailer park roots, this is an album not to be missed."
5,"Paul Thorn ""Hammer and Nail""","I recently saw Paul open for John Prine and was very impressed. I visited his website after the show and bought ""Hammer and Nail"" there isn't a song here that I don't enjoy. He has a great talent for telling a tale that you can relate to. All of the songs on this disc tell of things that could have happened to all of us."
4,Cold's Debut rules,"This album is packed with alot of raw emotion, and overall it is a really good album. I picked up Year of the Spider first, and although i enjoyed it, I was looking for something a little heavier. This is exactly what i was looking for. It is good raw music although it is hard to understand what Scooter is saying at certain times in a song. The guitars are kinda distorted but that doesn't mean it don't sound good. My personal favorite track is ''Goodbye Cruel World.'' Other standout tracks are ''Go Away'', ''Give'', and ''Serial Killer.'' Almost all of the songs are good though. I recommend this cd to any fan of good hard rock. Buy this album and you won't regret it."
5,It's great.,"The debut album of one of my favorite bands, Cold. Of course I'm gonna give this album 5 stars, but it honestly deserves the 5. Every song is great and, once you get this album, it will probably be in your CD player for the next week or two (or until you get Year of The Spider or 13 Ways to Bleed On Stage)."
3,Unplugged? Not really.,"Too bad Adams wasn't a bit more courageous on this live recording. It would have been interesting to hear Adams and his guitar take on these songs. Instead, we get Adams, his band w/string accompaniment by Julliard students making for just another greatest hits package with a twist. Some interesting versions of Adams' hits are to be found, but it all adds up to nothing new. However it is very listenable; particularly the bluesy ""If you wanna be bad-You Gotta be Good."""
3,Grade C+,"Bryan Adams' MTV UNPLUGGED cd is from the tv series of the same name. Although he is ""unplugged"" rest of the band at times is not. Atruly acoustic set this is not, and makes for a big disappointment. His choice of songs is not the greatest either. Alot of his big hits are left off, and lesser know songs are put in. Just like any concert you go to, you want to hear the hits, so if your after that, like I was, this may not be your cup of tea."
5,Bryan's Most Amazing Album,"Before I begin my review, let me state that this album is not Greatest Hits Live. In fact, only 3 of these songs can be found on his 1993 Greatest Hits album SO FAR SO GOOD. I'd be surprised if you could identify more than five of these songs. That's how this album is.When Bryan decided to do an Unplugged, he didn't just change keys of the songs and leave the plug out of his instrument...he re-worked song after song, changed tempos and paces, and even wrote brand new material.""I Think About You,"" is no longer a sappy ballad, but it's an up-tempo country type song, while ""I'm Ready,"" is no longer hard rocking. It is now a soft and wonderful ballad.To finish off the album, Bryan chose a song from 18 Til I Die entitled ""I'll Always Be Right There,"" in which he and Keith finally perfected.This may not have Bryan's biggest or best songs, but the way he pulls them off proves why Bryan is one 80's artist who can hold his own in the 90's."
4,Adams goes straight to my heart.....,"I have been a BA fan for about 8 years now. Yes, I would die to meet him and I must say this is his best album yet. He transforms his classics beautifully by adding cultural flair. I was so moved by his unplugged rendition of ""I'm ready"" and ""Fits You Good."" His music has always gone straight to my heart and has once again on this album. I congratulate Bryan and his band, which I know all by names. I have enjoyed his music for years and I will continue to do so in the future. Anyway, if you're a fan, don't let this album pass you by, it's a must!! Hope Bryan comes my way soon in AZ."
5,Food for the Soul,"India, the oldest living civilization on earth, could not have been portrayed better than what is revealed in Robert Arnett's masterpiece, India Unveiled. The timing of the book is also important as India is somewhat blindly adopting technological advancement and consumerist values, that the Western civilization has to sell. The cravings of mind and body might get temporary ease and comfort with complex technology and chaotic consumption but what India's simple, deep and timeless spiritual heritage has to share with the world is of the soul, by the soul and for the soul, and hence blissful, peaceful and beautiful. And Robert Arnett's soulful explorations of India's sacred dimension is one of the greatest gifts for all present and future soul-seekers, East and West."
4,Not too bad!,"I am a huge fan of Underworld, Emerson, PVD, many such progressive authors. I saw this at the store today after I did a trade in, and I decided to give this a try since Darren Emerson was one of the core members of Underworld, I figured why not.It's not bad! It's a little bit different than what I'm used to, but not by much - it's really great! I'd recommend getting a used cd."
5,This book is very suspenseful and enjoyable.,"This, I think, is one of Anderson's best X-Files novels. It is interesting, suspenseful and gives you the feeling of being in the story with the characters. You feel the same emotions that the characters feel and the characters seem real and believable. This is definatly a book that I would recomend to all of my friends and even people that I don't know. This is X-Files at it's best."
4,Good starter book on MPLS,"This is a good introductory book on MPLS, but lacks information on design, deployment, and management. The book has two chapters on Ipsilon flow management protocol and tag switching, which seems to be overkill to explain the evolution of MPLS. However, the book is easy to read compared to reading the MPLS specs."
3,Good introduction to MPLS but too dated to be useful,"This book is simply too dated to be much help in 2008. The authors spend a lot of time on talking about the HISTORY of label switching, and about who the key players that brought the standard out. And then he describes each of the original popular non-standards (like Cisco's Tag Switching) in some detail. It seems like it takes FOREVER to actually to get something useful and relevant. And then while talking about MPLS, the authors have phrases like, ""BGP and PIM would be perfectly suitable for label distribution"" --- that's great. I'm glad they are theoretically ideal --- but it's just not important now if the popular vendors haven't implemented it that way (or there isn't a standard defined for that method)I think this book might have been nice intro and useful in 2000, when it was released -- but there must be better, more updated books now."
3,Wish the book were more technical,"I was expecting a lot from this book. It turns out I am a bit disappointed. Some of the materials had already been covered in the author's ""IP switching"" book. I wish the book covered more technical materials (ex. design, ..etc)."
1,"product ""in stock"" but really not","My poor review does not reflect the quality of the product, but rather the fact that after waiting for 2 weeks for the item to be shipped (from Cables to Go, who kept promising that the item would be available the ''next day''), it was clear that nothing was going to happen. I had to go through a labyrinthine process via Tiger Direct to cancel and then reorder (from another vendor)--meaning that my wiring project has been delayed by about three weeks."
4,I wish it had more episodes.,"the movie is great has a really cool storyline , but it doesn't unfold like I wish it would , you're really getting into it when it stops (?!) , I was wondering if there where more episodes on sale , but for my surprise .. No -_-* , that its really sad.but still , its good."
3,"A great idea, with two flaws.","A great idea. The brush is nice and long, and fits nicely on the cup--no more tipped-over cups! Two disappointments:1) Amazon description says ""Dishwasher-safe for easy cleanup"" but the Weber packaging says dishwasher cleaning is NOT recommended. I have washed the brush in the dishwasher but not the cup.2) Brush has knobs at the end of the bristles. If I am brushing oil on after spices, this causes the spices to get dragged around/brushed off. Should be no problem for basting or mopping with sauce late in the cooking process.Other than these two problems, it is a nice accessory. I will continue to use the set, and am glad that I purchased it."
3,"Great brush, not as great container","I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, the brush is just as fantastic as every other implement in Weber's new Style line. It is solid metal, the silicone bristles are a good length, and it just looks and feels great in the hand. The source of my ambivalence is the saucing cup that comes with it. It does hold the brush neatly, which is nice. But, it is a cheap-feeling plastic, which will melt if you get it too close to the hot grill.You may want to consider buying just the brush instead, which Amazon sells for less money than the combo. Pair it with a shallow ceramic dish and you'll have a better system. Get one with a lid and you'll be able to put your sauce straight in the refrigerator after using it. The glass won't stain, it goes in the dishwasher, and cleans up easily.Weber 32912/6432 Silicone Basting BrushCorningWare French White 15-Ounce Oval Dish"
2,Very Uncomfortable!,"The sound quality of these headphones is ok. There was a pretty constant buzz or hum in the background. I like the feature of using regular batteries, no dying and waiting for them to recharge. The headphones are very uncomfortable! The self-adjusting strap is constantly pushing down on my head and pulling up on my ears. I couldn't wear them for very long without them giving me a headache."
4,Fun to use.,"I directed a play (Charley's Aunt) where I needed to use a few fans.These fans open and shut rather nicely. Nice sandalwood smell.We beat the heck out of the fans during the performance and they withstood most of what we dished out. If you just need a fan for the sake of having a fan, these aren't so bad. If you plan on abusing your fan, you may want to buy a couple extra... we did. We liked them."
5,A Must Read for All Romance Readers,"Ms. Claire graces us with perhaps the best work of romance fiction of the last 50 years. Moreover, unlike other romance novels, it's one that men can and will appreciate as much as women. Credit Ms. Claire's skillfully intertwined story of romance, action, and high-intensity drama. It's one book that every home library should proudly display."
3,BW FAN,"THIS IS GOOD MUSIC HOWEVER, SONG ARE DONE TOO FAST SOUNDS MUCH LIKE A BEACH BOY CONCERT OF TODAY IF YOU WANT BB MUSIC DONE RIGHT LISTON TO BRIAN WILSON AND HIS BAND."
4,Way easier than cutting by hand.,"I liked that I could get into tight places. It took a couple of cuts to get used to the saw--but once I did, it worked real well. It would be nice if the blade was made to cut thru nails also. No matter how hard I tried--I hit a couple of nails."
1,Please don't waste your money.,"I can't believe I paid $21.95 for this 50 cent story. If you like romances about pretty girls and hockey players, read Rachel Gibson's much better novels like See Jane Score.The whole plot of this book is a contrived romance between a commitment-phobic former NHL player and a school teacher who also likes to coach pee-wee hockey teams. If you're looking for steam, there is none."
4,good,"A little more wear on the book than expected, but nothing that interfered with my enjoyment of the book. Arrived promptly."
2,????????????????,The author assumes that the reader has a knowledge of the symbols used in Chinese Chess. Not impressed.
5,Excellent depth for such an early title...,"C# is an extremely exciting new language, and this book does an excellent job getting the intermediate to experienced programmer up to speed. I was able to read this book in one sitting, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I definately recommend this book to anyone looking for an introductory book that goes beyond the basics."
3,Decent Introduction to C#,"Other than the fact that this book could have been better structured (everything is in the right order, but its broken up into way too many chapters - 36) and some of the presentation is choppy and sparse (heck, theres a chapter called ""Other Class Stuff"") - this is the better book to get acquainted with C# for the moment. The last 10 or so chapters are excellent - and for most experienced programmers, things are covered in detail where they need to be."
4,It was good when I bought it,"I bought this book a while ago. Days when MS announced C#, I wanted to get my hands on a book that can give me a head start. I saw this one in the market and bought it. This is a good book for those who want an ""introduction"", for advance stuff you will have to refer to some other book.Even though I have professional C#, I still sometimes open Gunnerson's book for a quick look on a certain topic. He has done a very good job by keeping things simple.Second edition of this book is out now. I haven't yet read it, but I belive that there must be some improvements.Deepak Kapoor"
2,Could some 100 pages,"1. Do not spend enough time on .NET platform. Where he does it seems like thing were copied from msdn.2. The code examples were copied from page to page sometime more than twice. why?3. I still give two stars to this book as i apriciate the effort to write about a product that is still officialy in beta, but still i would try something else"
5,Very good book.,This is a very *very* good book if you want to learn c#. It's a good introductory text for those who are already familiar with C/C++. The book is very well organized and the author communicates the subject matter clearly with good programming examples.
3,This book is not a work of fiction!,"As an American who worked in Japan in the 1980's, I read this book with a special sense of recognition. You may think that what the protagonist experiences in this book is highly exaggerated. Believe me, it is not! This is a very enjoyable read for those who can empathize with what it is like to be a foreign woman in Japan, and should be an amusing read for anyone else interested in modern Japan."
1,Not as Advertised,"I find the hyperbole of all these other reviews highly misleading and found this book to be quite different than I expected. This book is a small, inelegant smorgasborg of Yankee trivia and thumbnails of history spiced with a number of poorly reproduced photographs. There is very little here which isn't found elsewhere, often in a much better form. I almost wonder if this is the same book everyone else read. As Simon says, ""Dreadful."""
4,A very funny cd!,"""Jokes To Go"" is a must-have for Kip Addotta fans, or for anyone with a great sense of humor. There's a LOT of funny stuff on here!Kip's as funny (if not funnier) than ever on this album.It's really a shame Kip's other albums aren't offered here on Amazon. Luckily though, they can be found on Kip's official website. Amazon doesn't allow URLS in reviews, but I'll give ya hint what it is: it starts with 3 w's and a dot, then Kip's full name, and then a dot and a com. Enjoy!"
3,Not Ted Sorensen's Best,"This book could be have so much better and be a lot more relevant to today. It was written in 1996 after the disastrous midterm elections for the Democrats when Newt Gingrich and his Republicans had taken back the House. Ted Sorensen could have so much more to offer to Democrats and aspiring Democrats from his personal story, experience, and his articulate phrases. Instead, this is a droning litany of platitudes and vague ideals that is at worst, a little bit dated. The best parts are references to his own past, his childhood, and his roots in Nebraska. Luckily, Ted Sorensen rectifies a lot of this with his 2008 memoir, Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History."
2,piranha,It was slow and not what I expected. I wanted to see fish killing things and then dying at the end. sorry this dvd is not worth the money
1,DO NOT bother,"When you print on these, the heat from the laser printer seems to cause the paper to go light grey all over. This is a splotchy grey that is not printer haze but some reaction with the heat. I've tried it on 3 different printers and all get the same reaction. To test, I also ironed a sheet quickly and it turned the same splotchy grey.....NOT worth the $"
2,disappointing,"Although there are pictures scattered throughout the book, they are mainly of small details and accents, rather than a total view of the houses. Also, it seemed that some of the pictures were not even of the design that was being featured. I found it difficult to get any perspective of relative dimensions or the overall feel of the design from simple line drawings and floor plans. Perhaps a better book for someone more familiar with architectural drawings than for someone just starting out and looking for inspiration. Finally, not many of the designs were of what I would call a cottage, with square footage at, or higher than most average homes."
1,P. Dudley Does It Again....Ooooooh Boy,"Absolutely HORRID. There's one very important thing to understand here: Sting is a proper songwriter; P. Dudley is not.He should never have touched this classic to begin with,as he can't come anywhere near Sting or his mastery of songcraft. Seems he wrecks anything he touches--just look what he did with Led Zeppelin's Kashmir. Hey,Dudley,a word of advice: you should only remix what you (think) you could do better,or at least just as good in another way. But for God's sake KEEP AWAY FROM THE CLASSICS!!! that's where your obvious lack of talent truly shines through. :}"
2,CARNIVAL OF BLOOD is a WA$TE OF $$$$$!!,"I thought this would be okay. This is soooooooooooooo stupid!! Burt Young is in this, I must say he made a better Uncle Paulie in ROCKY than a carnival freak!! I do NOT recommend anyone to buy this at full price!!! Wait till the $1 stores get it!! ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT--not only that UNBELIEVEABLE!! Watch it for yourself and you will see--BOO!!I just wonder how much was this film to produce! I bet a penny maybe even 25 cents. I wouldn't give you a dime for it!!"
1,Neil pushing product again,No artist throws more product out onto the market than Neil...lately most of it has been utter crap.Neil Young...the money making machine..squeezing his loyal fans for every last dime in their pockets.
1,Wrong Format,"I have not been able to view it yet as it is the wrong zone for Australia, I should have checked, never thought."
3,Text book style history,"I purchased a second hand copy of this book before a trip to Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. It is not what I would call exciting reading but it provides a good survey of Scandinavian history. The context helped me enjoy my trip more."
4,Solid collection,"Great art, good layout, a little inaccessible for my three year old; my fault, not Pinkney's, and I'm sure this collection will be around for years so she can grow into it."
5,Karen Does it Again,"I love Karen Voight's exercise vids and DVDs. She is intelligent, professional and motivating without being patronizing or cutesy. But make no mistake--her workouts can be really tough! This is one of the easier ones with lots of mix n' match possibilies. The step cardio sections are fun without being too complicated. However, the circuits are longer than what you might expect--this is NOT one of those 2 minutes of cardio, then two minutes of strength workouts. The circuits are longer and there are fewer of them.You need a exercise or Swiss ball for the BLT segment, which is fun. Using a ball can really enhance your toning since you have to spend the additional effort to maintain your balance. Just make sure you get the right sized ball!The DVD interface is easy to use and allows you to choose what you want to do for that day with some preprogrammed combination workouts and some choices that focus on just a single area (upper body, cardio etc.)"
5,Great workout,"This DVD is awesome. I exercise to it every morning. I love the ab work on the incline bench, I feel it everytime. I like to choose from different workouts so I never get bored. It makes me sweat so I know I'm getting a workout. Karen is so easy to follow, her cueing is great. I would not change a thing."
2,70's slasher film..,"briefly: basic slaser low-budget film from the 70's. I agree with several reviewers in that much of the film is too dark. You have a hard time seeing the actors faces or their movements. The lighting of the film could have been better.the plot is serviceable: a psychic with a military background is hired by a couple whose young daughter has disappeared to track down and find their daughter or the killer. Also nearby two grade school teachers who are friends are also being stalked by the same killer.The characters were interesting, but there wasn't much in the script for them to do.if the film were re-mastered and ""cleaned up"" digitally, it would earn another star from me."
2,VERY MEDIOCRE SLASHER MOVIE,"the demon has a few good moments, but not nearly enough to make it notable. The story (I think), deals with some kind of killer dispatched by evil/satan to murder women. The intro is awesome. the killer runs up to this house, then puts a strangulation bag on a mother then abducts the daughter. the father comes home just in time to save the mother, then runs out into the nearby woods an hollers ""where are you, you bastard"" (or something like that). the rest of the movie has cameron mitchell ""a military psychic"" on the case. all of the middle part of this movie is really boring, and the murky, dark transfer makes it impossible to see whats going on. The killer appears as a guy with a shadow over his face, in white makeup, and also in a white rubber mask (sometimes, all at the same time) which gives him a nice surrealistic quality, Luckily, I got this cheap on a slasher movie collection, and so should you."
4,Good But Could Have Been Better,"Don't get me wrong: Noonan has written another good book, just not as good as her book on Reagan. It's still worth reading because she shares the genuine love and affection many of us feel for John Paul the Great. But she drops the ball in chapter eleven where she tries to deal with the alleged lapses of the pontificate of JPG. She asserts that the liturgy got dumbed down during the watch of JPG--that's clearly wrong: the liturgy was already reeling well before 1978 when JPG became Pope. As to the sex abuse scandals, we get more heat than logic. Fortunately, our current Pope is already applying logical solutions such as the recent document barring homosexuals from ordination. The book is good, but it has its limits. Overlook the limits and enjoy her reminiscences about our common spiritual father. May he rest in peace!"
5,Shipment,"I placed the order on August 26th ..I live in Greece and even though I chose the slowest shipping method there is (Shipping Speed: Standard International Shipping), and Delivery Estimate was on October 12, 2010 , my order arrived in less than a month.I have placed orders in the past and I'm always satisfied with your services . Thank you !"
5,Love this!,"I stayed up watching this all night, i love this show and the packing for the dvds made it more enjoyable."
3,Charmed to have a Book of Shadows,"The series by far is exceptional , and for the price that the complete series is it was a no brainer that I would purchase the ""famed"" Book of Shadows. The final disc had some scratches, and if it were not for I already having the series I would pay more attention to the lack of which this series has given me. I am excited though to own the book , and as for the other discs will have to see them as I choose. For I have not viewed all the discs ,but rather only the last special features disc which this complete series provides."
2,Most Discs will not play,"I have been trying to watch Season 5 since I received the package almost a month ago. One disc refuses to play any of the episodes. I have tried cleaning it with specific products but still no hope. If it did not have the other season attached I would send it back. I fear if I do return for another set, a new one will be sent in similar condition. Please be cautious when ordering such product from this buyer. I have NEVER had this much issue with a dvd purchase on amazon. Not sure if the manufacturer stored the discs too long but the adhesive melted within the discs. I am VERY disappointed."
3,Charmed Series 1-8,Some of the first DVD's do not work properly. Many of the shows I can not watch due to defects on disks. I feel as if I paid too much for this product considering the quality of some of the DVD's. I would not recommend the seller to anyone!
1,love it,Ok i love this series and i am not dis the series and the book i love it the bad part is that when i open it and took out the first DVD it had glue all over it so i look at the rest there was 15 Dvds with glue all over them i as soo mad i called and they gave me a replacement and the replacement had glue all over a few DVDS (my hubby wouldn't tell me how many) so what the store did was took the one from one set and the other set and peace it together so buy be were look at all your DvDs and that is why i only gave it one star the series is awesome just the book has some problems.
3,"Charmed, but not by the price.","I recently became a Charmed fan. I have watched the first six seasons and would have loved to buy the boxed set, but the $279.99 price tag is wat out of line. You can purchase (if you want) Charmed at BJ'S price club for $29.99 easch season ($240.00 for the complete series). For me that is still too much money for an old TV series, even Charmed and I prefer to rent each season from the library for a $2 a season."
5,great copy,this is a great copy of the series with awesome pictures from the book on the show between the pages of discs
1,The show is wonderful but the packaging is horrible,"I love this show and would rate the series 5 stars but could only give it one star because of the packaging. The way the book is made the DVD's get glue and scratches all over the back of them. Most of the DVD's will not play or if they do play they skip. I received this as a Christmas gift but Amazon told me the return expiration date passed on December 4th so they would not work with me to return the item. Highly disappointing.To anyone that loves this show I would recommend that you but the individual seasons even though it will cost a bit more. This box set is not worth the $175 you spend.I am a frequent Amazon shopper but because of this and there ""not-our-problem"" attitude I am not sure that I will shop with them anymore."
1,Disappointment,"I have been a customer of Amazon, so far. Relying on the information you put on the product, the television show Charmed, it acquired, as in the description of the product put subtitles in Spanish, which has not proved true. Only season 8 is subtitled in Spanish. I feel cheated, and therefore I will return the product, and I want my money back to me, and I apologize, I really am disappointed. Besides the product, the discs are attached with glue, and small scratches discs.SorryThank you.Jorge Navarro"
3,Tired of cleaning the discs,"I wanted to wait until I watched the Charmed series before i commented. (the last vendor sent me several damaged discs and instead of sending me new ones, they refunded me...and the search was on.) Wish I could have found this in a store, easier to return.The book is awesome, great presentation, love the series. Unfortunately, you will have to clean most of the discs with a dvdcleaner since paper is always stuck in shipping. I only received 1 disc that was damaged this time. Hopefully this vendor will send me a new one. I'll let you know."
2,DVD's are scratched and skip horribly,The book is beautiful and my daughter loved the look of it. Unfortunately over half of the CD's have skips and scratches causing the DVD player to freeze. Ended up missing alot of the shows. Very disappointed after spending so much for the series. Holiday let-down for sure.
2,bien,dommage que les dvd ne peut etre lu en francais et que les pages ne soit pas n'ont plus en francais
1,it stinks,"I bought this cause i love the show. but when i started to play it my dvd player,laptop,desktop,and another dvd player said skipping over damaged area. the season 1 and 2 dvds had all these scratches on them and some dried glue stuff. and this was on like 6 of them not just one if i were u i would just by them 1 by 1"
2,There is such a thing as too much giving.,"This book upset me as a kid and it upsets me as an adult. When I was little, I remember crying for the poor, lonely, broken tree and her love for the callous boy. OF COURSE we should teach our children about the power of unconditional love. But I do not want to teach our children that love is giving and giving and giving until you are nothing but a cold, dead stump. I'm a big fan of most of Silverstein's other work, and I think his heart was probably in the right place with The Giving Tree, but when I have kids, I do not think that this book will be part of their collection. Where The Wild Things Are, now there's a children's classic about unconditional love."
5,Giving Tree Brings Grateful Tears,"Shel Silverstein creates a beautiful picture of unselfish love. I cannot read this to my children without crying! As parents, we, like the tree, give all we have and we are happy."
5,A Test,"A tree is an age-old symbol of unconditional giving. It shades, feeds, endures... Love endures all things. I really pity the folks who fail to see the goodness of this book."
5,sweet sweet sweet,this was my favorite book as a child. one of my few childhood memories is reading this with my mom and discussing kindness. wonderful story to become a part of any child's life
1,I love Shel Silverstein...mostly...,"I am in the group that finds this book disturbing. I adore almost all other Shel Silverstein- his poetry books are a staple that I think every family library should have, but this one has always bothered me. The selfishness of the boy and what I think is the tree ultimately giving itself to death just really bother me. Not one I plan to share with my kids."
2,I do not think this sends the best message to kids,"I love my children and would do anything to help them. But I do not think this book sends the right message to children. I do not think it is right for the tree to allow herself to be chopped down so the boy can build a boat. Perhaps I am missing something, but I just do not understand why I would read this to my kids, especially my daughter."
4,LOVE IT!,This is a great book. I read this book when I was a kid and it is so awesome that I can now read it to my children. This book has a really good message about giving. This is a good example of how a parent would gives to their child.
2,Terrible!,"I felt so deceived - i thought this would be a story about generosity and unconditional love. This book would be more appropriately titled ""The Taking Boy."" An awful tale about a hateful boy taking advantage of a pitiful tree who gives him everything at its own expense. There is nothing redeeming about the story at all, and the story teaches all the wrong lessons about the nature of love."
5,Book evokes emotion in young and old,"I agree with a lot of the ""interpretations "" of this story:but in essence, is not a good book, story, or movie one that makes you think, analyze and surmise? That moves you in a way to keep dwelling on it?This book made me cry when I read it, and of course later you peel away the layers of the onion to compare it to human relationships: but for it do this it has to be an EXCELLENT story, whether you like the gist of the tale or not. I loved it.Thank you Shel!"
1,Not for all children,"I think, had I read this as an adult, I might have considered it a very good book. However, it was read to me when I was young. I was a sensitive child and remember feeling very badly because of this book. I cried. I was sad for the tree, sad for the boy -- I felt just awful.I mention it only because I personally remember having a negative reaction to the book... I don't think all children would react this way, but if you have a particularly sensitive child you might want to reconsider."
1,Giving till it hurts,"A college friend loaned me her copy of THE GIVING TREE when I was 20, saying it was her favorite book in the world. After I read it, I wanted to throw up. What kind of person would find any redeeming value in such a sadistic tale of unmitigated greed, violence, and destruction?She turned out to be a criminal. I was one of her victims. Not to say that every child who reads this book will grow up to become a felon, but this story certainly appears to encourage people to take advantage of their friends and then destroy them. Fortunately, I managed to stop that parasite in her tracks. She won't be taking anything more from this tree.As I write this, I imagine her sitting in prison somewhere...probably reading THE GIVING TREE aloud to her fellow inmates."
4,"Short, yet gives a lot in the words","This book is about a tree who smiles at the boy's pleasure. When the boy was young, he climbed the tree's trunk, play swing on her branches, and eat apples. But when the time has passed, the boy grew older and spent times out rather than to play with the tree. When the boy came again, he asked for money, a house, and a boat. Tree did her best to make the boy happy, but in the end, the tree was no more than an old stump.In my opinion, I think the giving tree is like your parents. When you were young, they play with you and take care of you. However, when they grew old, they become no more than an old tree stump when you don't visit them. I think this book is short, but has a lot in the words."
3,The Giving Tree,"This heart-throbbing fiction book will put a lump in your throat. When the boy thinks of only himself throughout the book, the giving tree eventually breaks down. As the boy takes her apples, branches, and trunk, she ends up worse off. As the boy grew older, he kept coming back without thanking or praising her for all the good deeds she provided for him. I think the boy was quite selfish for stealing all the items off the tree. If you enjoy sad-like books, The Giving Tree is the book for you. Shel Silverstein did an excellent job on telling the book as it is. He made good points which will teach kids the correct way to behave. If you want to read this book, check it out at your local library. I guarantee that you won't regret it. This is my most favorite book, so you know it's a good one!"
2,Hard to find any positive message,"You can squint, you can stare, you can read it over and over but any positive message in this book will still be hard to find. I usually read the book before reading it to my niece but I didn't do so with this one. I wish I had. I felt like stopping half-way through the story but I hoped it would get better. You can explain it to a child in a certain way but you can't escape the negative undertones of this book. It's sad and depressing. It seems like it's teaching that it's ok to keep asking for more and more and to never be happy with what you have. Adults could understand the meaning but have fun trying to explain it to a child. I don't recommend this book."
1,Awful,This story is morbid. Many people recommended it and I bought it for my daughter. We read it once and threw it away. Really.
5,Giving Tree,"This has always been one of my favorite Shel Silverstein books. I have used it at school, at church, at other places, with children and adults of all ages. To me it is one of the best examples of giving and grace. I was very happy with the various types of copies of this book I found at Amazon. I also was very happy with the speed with which I got the book."
3,Well Written But Terribly Depressing,"The author makes a great point about the selflessness of the tree, but it also highlights the digusting nature of humanity - how it sucks the life out of nature. Even though I found the illustrations and narration beautiful, the sad story made me depressed for days. But if you like stories like this, try reading ""Love You Forever"". Leaves a lump in your throat."
1,"An awful, awful book about selfishness and ingratitude","Let me make this perfectly clear: adults think this is great b/c they identify with the selfless, sacrificing, giving tree. If you know children, you know that they identify with the young boy and not the tree. His role is to take from the tree, and then come back to take and take some more - without gratitude or giving back. Only his ""taking"" endures. If you listen to children tell you about this book, you will know I'm right. Please skip this book; Shel Silverstein has so many wonderful others!"
5,Goodwill So. Cal. scores again,"Shel Silverstein's ""The Giving Tree"" was advertised slightly used, in fact it is just about brand new. There is one small tear on the cover. Once again I got a great book at an even greater price from this vendor. I would not hesitate to recommend them."
3,Sad message,"The message of this bood was quite sad. Taking advantage of that which helps, until it can no longer live except in death is quite sad in my book. My young friends were quite distrubed by the ending, asking why the man killed the tree that was so helpful. They are only 6 years old. I couldn't answer them."
5,One of the Best Programs You Can Watch on Your TV :0,"This rating applies to all three seasons of ""Through the Wormhole..."" In my opinion, this is one of the most well produced, thought provoking and visually stimulating series that I have ""EVER"" watched on TV. I was so happy to find these DVDs available on Amazon, because they've allowed me to free up valuable Tivo recording space. The concepts in these DVDs are so mind boggling that I can watch them over and over and learn something new every time. And the icing on the cake is the narration acumen of one of my favorite actors, Morgan Freeman. I urge you to check out the show on the Science network, HD is awesome to see, and I hope you like it.Yours for more informed shopping,Dennis"
4,Trilok Gurtu - a solid album,"I nearly lost my mind while listening to the first two tracks, ""Rajasthan"" and ""DJ Didgeridoo."" I've never heard anthing like his music, and my CD collection includes a wide range of world music and styles. The inclusion of Angelique Kidjo on several tracks makes this a very special fusion of diverse cultures. Well done!"
1,Terrible print quality ruins a new york great.,"It is such a shame that the atrocious print quality ruins what could have been an excellent publication.Perhaps the publishers merely photocopied the old newspaper prints of Weegee's work, how else could it be so bad.Being such a fan of his work, I can't under emphasize how incredibly disappointed I was with this!!!!"
1,takin' It back,"I'm looking for a decent PC mike and this isn't it. I have all volumes (mike record)and output turned all the way up and have to put the mike 3 inches from my face to get a decent recording. If I set it on the desk where its 8 inches from my face, I get a very week recording. I thought this would be better because the package says the mike is amplified but not very much. So what is the perfect PC mike? Anyone have any sugestions?"
4,it's okay,"Light is very bright, it's actually awesome, but battery life is terrible, it's like 10-15 minutes and the light is bigger and bulkier then it looks."
1,Junk!,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap. No where the candle listed. It's pretty much just a big, bulky cheap flash light. Don't waste your money"
5,excellent horror collection,"This twenty-two story horror collection features tales written in 2002 that first appear in this book though some have probably reappeared elsewhere. The tales run the gamut of horror from the supernatural to the psychological to the suspense and include several of the who's who of the genre like Douglas Clegg, Bentley Little, and Graham Masterson. As stated the contributions encompass much of the genre as Richard Chizmar must have provided the authors with one apparent instruction to entertain the readers, which they do as no tale is bad and with some like those of Little, Brian Freeman, and John Pelan quite good. Fans who like a wide variety of themes from ghost stories to revenge to the millennium end will want to read this enjoyably shivering compilation.Harriet Klausner"
3,Product OK,"It does not restore the pads to the original tack, it is very sticky but it does allow you to get a little more life out of the pads."
1,Don't bother with this...,"This is a very very bad best of CD.. If U want Police then get the Best of Police CD, if U want Sting then get his Fields of Gold best of album. This CD is a weak compilation of his with only a few hits, don't waste your money on this one."
3,It's Okay,"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. The music of course is good, and of course there are good songs here. However, you'll find the same songs on better and more representative collections of Sting's solo efforts and of The Police's group hits."
3,Wrong CD but was resolved!,"i was sent the wrong cd, i contacted the seller, and there was no hesitation, and i was given a full refund! thanks! Great Customer service, but im still looking for that one..."
4,Great collection,"I've loved the song ""HIM"" ever since I heard it years ago. Lines and melody from it have played in my head every now and then all these years so I finally got around to buy it and, ofcourse, ""Escape"". Now I have found the rest of the songs on this album very enjoyable also, especially ""Terminal""."
1,I Pod Transmitter,This product was terrible. The joy of great price shortly replaced with the anguish of poor performance.
4,Great starting place,"An excellent review for first time DIY PC builders. It won't help you decide on the specific components for your system, and its a bit behind the curve technically (ie., PATA vs. SATA drives), but overall its an excellent summary of the process of building your own pc.I used it as a guide, then used web resources (many provided in one of several useful appendices) for further research, chose my components, purchased them and successfully put together a high end gaming pc. This was a great project, and this book was very helpful in making it a success. It is not a standalone resource, however."
1,Worse than horrible!,"Horrible Horrible - I have barely started using my 120oz bottle and my glasses are cloudy, silverware is white washed and plates feel like they have a gritty coating. I would give this negative stars if I could. I am going to try and get my money back and try to figure out how to fix all my dishes. I ran citric acid through the dishwasher and that didn't even get the scum completely off. Don't think this stuff was ever tested."
1,Makes a mess and does NOT clean at all,This is a horrible product. Please don't waste your money like I did. The detergent left an awful white residue and it got worse with every load that I ran. After about 5 loads the area around the detergent drawer was completely gunked up and I had to scrub it off. I ended up throwing out the bottle only about 3/4 used. Very bad product and it is really hard for me to believe that Palmolive would be brave enough to put it on the shelves as a dishwashing detergent. Its almost false advertising.
1,Excessive suds,"I try to use environmentally friendly products so I picked this up. I have a new Maytag dishwasher in our Rental house and used it to run the first load. There were suds everywhere. The appliance install person was still there and was convinced I had used dishwashing soap by mistake but I showed him the bottle. Then I brought it home and ran out of my regular Finish tablets so I put a TINY amount in the Bosch. Suds were still in the bottom of the dishwasher when the cycle was completed. I ran the rinse cycle. Still suds left. Now my dishwasher is not working and I can't help but wonder if the Palmolive had anything to do with it. Regardless, I simply can not use this big bottle of dishwasher gel. I can't understand it."
1,Beware white film,"I have the same problem as the majority of the people here. I have a new dishwasher, the water is around 140 degrees, I have tried various flow settings of jet dry, I have tried different volumes for the dish soap, but I suspect I have hard water. So this product may not work well with anything other then soft water. Price is nice for an eco/green product."
5,Can't understand the bad reviews,"We've been using this product ever since we got our new dishwasher almost two years ago and have once had the problem others have talked about (white powder). Not once but we have never used anything but this product so perhaps that has something to do with the problem - or it could be a particular water difference from place to place. Obviously if someone has this problem, they should use something else. We have had terrific luck with it but clearly that is not universal. Give it a try and see if it works for you."
1,Don't buy it! Learn from our mistake.,"Like pretty much everyone posting here, this caused a white film over our dishes and dishwasher. I can't believe this is still on the market! Too bad I didn't research dishwasher fluid before I bought it.. who does unless it is on-line.Anyway, if you are here.. you now have info that the rest of didn't have before we bought it used and had to fix the problems it caused."
1,Ruined My Dishes,"Relieved (and yet horrified) to find that my suspicions about this product are true. Thick, white film all over all my dishes that will NOT scrub off even after multiple scrubbings by hand. My dishwasher is less than 6 mths old & was afraid that something was wrong with it. I used this product twice (second time with a rinse solution) and that was enough to tarnish mostly everything. Now after reading that it has affected dishwashers as well, I will try to use the vinegar to see if that at least will clear out my dishwasher. Wow."
5,Book,"This Book is a great product, just what I expected to get in the mail. Fast shipping and great conditiion of the book. Looking forward to buy more products like that"
1,Pretty but less functional than others,"This product matches others I have and looks very sleek, but it's card handling is not the best, and as another reviewer said, it can be difficult to close the lid. Mine fell and broke so I relaced it with a more functional file, albeit less good looking."
1,Largely over-rated.,"With so many excellent books on this topic, I am surprised at the positive score. This is a very poor book, both in terms of the lack of clarity of the examples - and the inadequate explanatory text. I would recommend potential buyers to think twice about wasting money on this tome; much of the content can be gleaned from the net for free anyway. Avoid."
4,"Tough, clear cut plot","Private detective Elvis Cole, is hired by a high profile, media savvy lawyer, Jonathan Green, as a special investigator in the murder case of the wife of a famous restuateur, Teddy Martin. Detective Angela Rossi, a career policewoman with ambitions of becoming the first woman Chief of detectives, has been accused of planting incriminating evidence against Martin to further her own career.When Elvis realises that he is being set up to blur the evidence, he quits but continues to work on the case with the police. This is a pacy, smart story with just enough humour to leaven out the violence."
2,Hopelessly Disorganized,"I had to use this book in two classes for my Land Use/GIS degree. The book's layout is rather confusing, and the information is not laid out in a logical manner. Headings and sub-headings are not apparent and do not follow a natural progression. Seems like the book was put together with a cut-and-paste method! The text is about as dry as a well-done pot roast. Good bedtime reading!The primary purpose of map making is to guide the reader's eye to areas of importance, and to get the information across to the reader in a concise, interesting, and elegant manner. This book does none of these well.The breadth of information, however, is quite good, hence the two stars. This is probably why it is used frequently by faculty."
3,"A quick read, but lacking depth","The author is too passionate about the Red Sox to write an objective review of the great '75 Series. And the interviews he does manage to get from participants lack depth. I often felt, which the author admits, that he was watching the games on videotape and writing about what he saw. The title pulled me in, and i was disappointed."
4,"Cosmic mayhem, massive destruction, but not worth $50","This was Jim Starlin's last (for now) Thanos Story. The mad god has decided to atone for his evil works and (with the help of Adam Warlock) sets out to save an alien civilization from Galactus. But Galactus has his own plans which may unleash something even worse.This is a great, old-fashioned cosmic battle royale. All of Starlin's favorite characters - Moondragon, Pip the Troll, Adam Warlock and of course Thanos - get a chance to help in a literally planet-shattering battle against Galactus and a new threat the Hunger. Starlin's art has all of its usual energy and the vibrant colors make it jump off the page.If you like cosmic comics this is a great read.BUT... it's out of print and going for insane sums right now. I would not pay much more than $20 for it."
1,A cruel joke,"This is nothing but a vicious pack of lies fabricated by cowards to justify the persecution of Jews. It is perhaps the greatest testimony to the utter moral and intellectual bankruptcy of anti-semitism possible. To the extent that it still has tbe power to win over the gullible and ignorant, it remains a work of evil. For other purposes, it is merely a joke."
1,This book is a classic work of anti-Semitism,"The main problem with the book is that it is a forgery. Reputable scholars, who have investigated the circumstances surrounding the writing and publishing of the book, have established this fact beyond all reasonable doubt, and no one who asserts differently has a leg to stand on. Someone who claims the book is true is totally ill-informed, sadly uninformed,or just plain anti-Semitic."
1,Horrible - don't waste your money!,"I absolutely hated this video. I have the original cardio sculpt, ab sculpt, and body sculpt 3 pack and the fanny lifter, and I LOVE that series (although I don't feel the ab sculpt is difficult enough). This video looked like it was produced in the mid-80's. I'm completely uncoordinated--that's why I do aerobics in the privacy of my own home--and could not follow this at all. This video is actually several routines on the same DVD. I didn't like any of the routines or the instructors (I wasn't sure if one of the instructors was actually a woman or a man in drag).Overall, I found the quality of this video extremely poor and outdated, especially when compared to the Firm DVDs that I already own. I even lent this video to a friend to see what she thought and she hated it, too. Now I'm afraid to buy other Firm DVDs--I don't want to waste another $20 on a video I'll watch once then throw away."
3,Good workout but has its problems,"This is the first The Firm I have ever used and it is a good cardio/muscle workout, but I can't seem to get past the horrible music selection. Sometimes it sounds like I'm watching ""The Neverending Story"" and others times I just want to mute it. Also the women who lead this are hard to hear because of the music. I wish it had a mute option where I could do away with the music and I wouldn't have such a problem with it.They also don't teach you the steps or even preview them like in other exercise routines. They just get up there and start out with no preparation. Combine this with the low voices, and it's hard to keep up with the steps."
1,Only good for toilet paper...,"On paper this must have been a great idea. A book with ""500 highly accurate color profiles of the aircraft of the 4th, 20th and 55th Fighter Groups, arranged by squadron and cross-indexed to pilot and type"". Unfortunately the artwork could best be described as amateurish and worst of all the profiles are anything but accurate. The inclusion of a small number of b&w; photos (all of which have appeared in other, much better books in the past), only serves to highlight the innumerable errors (font of letters, location of markings, etc...).I bought the book on sale (60% off) and still felt ripped off. In fact, the only useful thing in it, is the bibliography where some excellent 8th AF titles are mentioned.Come to think of it, one star is probably too high a rating for this poor excuse of a reference book, but the Amazon rating system does not allow half star ratings."
1,The worst workmanship - were these guys drunk?,"I just received my 7' X 10'. This is the worst workmanship I think I've ever seen on a product. Who's doing the cutting, some drunk guy? One side is 109"" (9'1""), the other side is 116"" (9'8""). Oh well, lesson learned. A fairly cheap lesson at least."
3,Beware sizing!,"The size listed is larger than the actual tarp. It's called the ""cut"" size. The finished size is 4- to 6-inches smaller on each side. I was unaware of that and had to return. Other than that, the quality seemed in line with others we've owned."
5,"This Heavy Duty 6 x 10 Premium ""Clear"" Tarp is actually pretty!","I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and saw this tarp; it replaced a winter-battered white tarp that was begging to be put out of its misery. This clear tarp is heavy duty and lets in nearly all the natural light. The white grid with transparent squares is pleasing to the eye (landlord commented that is looks ""lacy"" but not frilly). There's no seam down the middle to worry about -- the other tarp leaked from the center seam. This tarp also has grommets on all sides. We've had several hard rainstorms in Seattle this week, and the tarp has stood up like a champ. Can't believe how sturdy and attractive it is for $11.There were no irregularities in terms of sizing, actually, it was a bit bigger than expected. Just one of those purchases that feels like a gift. Will never go with a solid colored tarp again.Really, really high quality item for the money.Thanks so much."
2,Poorly done.,"I suppose it's to be expected, seeing as the movie is never true to the book, but this movie was incredibly disappointing. Completely pointless details are emphasised too much (Eustacia supposedly being a witch comes to mind), whereas important plot details are lacking. The woman cast as Thomasin neither resembles the character in Hardy's novel, nor ever truly becomes the suddenly ""practical woman"" she is depicted to be as a result of the plot. The heath looks like a golf course instead of a complete wasteland, and reddle definitely doesn't wash off in water. It's completely inaccurate. I'd save my money and buy the book for $5."
2,my review,"I like the charachters. Catherine Zeta-Jones always does a great job in whatever movie that she plays in. It was a good movie but I still think that It could have been better in ways, more captivating than they brought out, more alluring. But it was simply good."
1,too expensive given gps that come for about the same price with this built in,I got ripped off. You see although this map is fine it costs too much to be reasonable when you consider you can buy a gps with this all in for about the same money.
3,"Denver - Vero Beach, Fl.","First of all, A/B switches with coaxial connectors are hard to find so the choices were very limited.This particular switch was packaged and rec'd in excellent shape. The price was fair and received in just a few days.The problem for the average rating is the switch itself. The switch has several false detents when switching from A to B or back. There is not a definite feel that you have made a good switch or contact."
4,Worth the price,"Needing a switch to toggle the tv between cable input and a VCR, I purchased this one based on its positive reviews, its price, and eligibility for free ""prime"" shipping.It works as advertised and is worth the price paid. It didn't garner 5 stars because, as other reviewers mentioned, the switch does not slide smoothly. However, the switch action has worked flawlessly."
3,Leary through and through,"I could have done without the musical interludes and the Deaf Mute cocktail party, but the stand-up parts were true to Leary's brand of humor and very very funny. And, unlike a lot of comedians, he's good for listening to over and over, especially Track 17. ""Chickenhead!"""
3,Disappointing if you've seen the special,"Unfortunately, this CD excludes some of the funniest stuff from the ""Lock 'n Load"" comedy special in favor of various skits and songs that are only somewhat funny (exception: Life's Gonna Suck When You Grow Up). It's still got lots of great stuff, but some highlights from the special, such as his story about being shot in the head with an arrow as a little kid and his quest to find ""coffee flavored coffee"" is missing. You'll like it better if you've not seen the video. I wish he'd devoted the whole thing to his special and then made a separate CD of studio bits."
5,This dude is hilarious,"Worth every penny and then some. If I only have to buy this CD 5 more times, it'll be worth it."
5,"Offensive, politically incorrect and fearsomely hillarious","There are only two albums by Denis Leary available - this one and ""No Cure For Cancer""; if you buy this one, you will get the other one, as well.Mr Leary is not just your average comedian getting an odd joke or two at the expense of political correctness; his entire act is built on values which are today trashed by self-appointed custodians of public good. He smokes, he devours meat and he does not say one bad word about McDonald's, and he is proud of it.His magnificient delivery sounds casual and effortless, just like your slightly drunk friend talking to you in a bar, but in fact every line is polished to perfection.You will either love this guy or hate him; either way, you will agree that he is an extremely strong comedian, one of the best in the business."
3,great comedy from a great verbal comedian,"but the songs, sketches, and static bits are a bit overboard, as other reviewers have noted. Also interesting is the transformation we see here: Dennis-the-pissed-off-reactionary from No Cure For Cancer has become Dennis-the-confused-father, trying to make some sense of the changes in the world. That's not to say he's stopped screaming, only that his screaming has taken on a plaintive wail of a man who has found that he is no longer (if he ever was) king of his own castle.All in all, a good second album, marred only by some ill placed ""filler."""
3,Keep Your Finger on the Skip Button,"I can't believe that nobody has mentioned all the perverted scenes in this movie.There's a naked guy who yanks himself on stage in front of little kids. There's three contestants who mock Jesus (what does mocking Jesus have to do with air guitar? Nothing.) Then there's the guy who thinks he's wonderful because he makes out with another guy on camera.With these scenes deleted, this could easily have been a great four or five star movie."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this movie.It was entertaining, funny and has a great narrative that is suprisingly suspenseful for a sucha goofball subject....and who can argue with the underlying message of peace on earth through air guitar.This is highly recommended. I give it three thumbs up!"
3,Review from the Synthesis,"People still use the term ""alternative"" when referring to rock bands that are anything but. The Apes, however, are deserving of this title, and prove it with their 5th release, Baba's Mountain. From the albums odd, chaotic, opening track, ""V.Y. March,"" to the eerie, almost gothic sounding ""Ornaments And Windchimes,"" nearly everything about The Apes latest release defies convention. To boot, The Apes don't have a guitarist, and yet it's never an issue. Even on the aggressive rock songs like ""The Green Bus"" and ""The Night Time Reaper,"" the driving bass and organ make up for it. Those farmiliar with the band, or looking to break away from conventional rock should take the tour of Baba's Mountain.-Jason CatanzariteSynthesis.net"
3,Spicy Cajun,"If you have a fantasy about being stranded with two incredibly handsome and hot cajuns and dominated by them, this is your book. The sex scenes were well written but some of the other scenes were quite frankly unbeliveable. Buy the book and see for yourself."
4,"Hey, that's what happened!","After reading some of these ""reviews"" I have to just remind these people that this is more than a film. In general, these things happened this way. I lived in Las Vegas during this time, and it was like I knew these guys. The only problem with the film is it makes them too nice. The real Tony Spilotro (Nicky Santoro in the film) would have taken Joe Pescis' character apart for breakfast."
4,Improvement over the standard DVD,"This HD DVD is a major improvement over the previous standard DVD, which had the movie spread over two sides of the disk and you had to flip the DVD over to finish the movie. On the HD DVD version you can watch the entire film uninterupted. Also the film looks much better in HD."
5,Finally another movie with the goodfellas crew!,"If you like the mob, then you will like this film! It shows how one man learned all the ins and outs of owning a Casino in beautiful Las Vegas(at the time!). The man is Robby Deniro and he's well connected as always in these films and THE MAN gives him the chance to run a casino. This movie has it all and for the fans of Scorcese and the mafia, con-artist genre then this is one movie you should pick up!"
4,"""Good Blu-ray Of Great Crime Drama!""","Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's1995 crime drama based on the book. A man reflects his life in the mobwith his wife and friend while managing a casino. This is a great filmand I like it just as much as ""Goodfellas."" This blu-ray has nice pictureand sound plus some neat extras. I recommend this good blu-ray."
3,The fall of first generation Los Vegas crime?,"The Disney-ization of Los Vegas is seen as a bad thing?Here the street wise bookie becomes a Casino bossand everything goes well until his marriage hitsthe rocks. The Robert de Niro character survivesbut everyone else dies in this modern tragedythat reminds one of a Shakespeare play.My take on this is that the next generationcrime bosses are the ones behind the laundered moneycorporations that run Los Vegas now.The fantastic profits are still there andstill being sent in suitcases to the people running things,but just in a way that is apparently completely legal.Cheaters in the Casinos still gets treated pretty much the same?There are still holes dug in the desert..."
5,Simply Five Stars,"Action, Drama, surprises, and fast moving blood and gore. Never underestimate another man's greed could describe this one. A rags to riches back to rags again story. But there is plenty of drama and action along the way (and a few giggles too). Bet you can't watch it just once."
3,"Not bad, but not great","With De Niro and Pesci together again, I was expecting this movie to folow in the footsteps on Goodfellas as far as quality and storyline, but I was disappointed. The film is much too long simply because it just doesn't stay interesting all the way through. The dialogue is bad at times. Sharon Stone's character gets very annoying quickly. This film isnt bad, but definitely nowhere near Goodfellas or many other Scorsese films has done."
2,It's Made In Mexico!!?,"Has anyone else noticed this once purchased the Casino Blu Ray?? - on the shrinkwrap it says 'Made in Mexico'.I believe this is an inferior product - the case even had 2 trays, but it's only 1 disc!I would like to know anyone else if this is a mistake, or of they are all being made in mexico?99.9% of all the blu rays i've bought off here are made in USA - why is this one not??!I'd really appreciate any other person's comments in regards to this matter."
1,Great Movie-Cheap Universal Format,"I bought this DVD about 3 weeks ago and have returned it for a third time because the format that Universal chose for this cool movie is horrible. I have had problems with Universal products before such as ""The Abbott and Costello"" Collection where the DVDs freeze up on my player. It is not the player's fault because each one that I have gotten to replace the defects have had the same problem occur in different parts of the film. I know from a documentary that I saw about ten years ago that Universal Studios was known as the cheapest hollywood studio and it seems that not much has changed. Be warned for those of you that already have this on the older DVD release to just keep it. I did not pick it up until this copy came out so I will have to keep trying until I find one that works."
4,R&B romance,"Written by Lala (who wrote You Give Good Love) and L. Cope. This is a sleek seductive slow jam by a 1997 Romeo. His vocal range is impressively broad and infused with a mature style that belies his then-apparent youth. Produced by Warren J. McRae with youth appeal and appeal for older folks. The reviewer in Billboard's June 14, 1997 issue could not wait to hear the whole album."
4,Hardcore Album,"Nice album. I liked his first album ""Mr. Lunasick"" but this is almost just as good. The songs on the first album were more diverse (with the beats and everythang.) 99% of the songs on this album deal with the same sub-genre - Murderin. ""Mr. Lunasick"" has a variety of songs from Gangsta to females to smooth to just kickin it. This is still much better than all of his proceeding albums like ""Totall Recall"" and ""Luni Coleone.com."" I like Hollis' beats but they all SOUND THE SAME! Andy, DJ Daryl, One Drop Scott, B.C. and the rest of AWOL's producers are off da chain Dog! My favorite song on this album is ""Back to Back."" ""Major Figgaz"" is also tizight along with ""12:00,"" ""Can You Hang,"" and ""Strictly Business."" I admit his flows are the sickest on this album. Get this and definitely ""Mr. Lunasicc."" if you don't already have it. Gone"
2,too fast,"For someone who has just picked up the guitar, this was way too fast to get any real instructions. It had a great overview about playing but didn't really teach the basics. Not really for first timers."
4,Best Bang for your Buck,"Keith Wyatt's DVD IS the best bang for the buck. I have Learn and Master Guitar, a $200. 18 DVD,s and as many CD,s lesson set and wish Learn and Master would have had Mr.Wyatt teaching it. For the beginner you are playing music immediately and isn't that what the vast majority of us want. For about $20. you get around 50 lessons vs. paying aninstructor $20. to $30. per lesson x 50=$1,250. The only negative I have is the rather confusing menu system. But, still worth the bucks."
2,Not worth the money,"Keith Wyatt, the instructor, obviously knows how to play a guitar, and has probably been playing for a lifetime. He makes it look ... soooo ... easy, and for him it is, but it won't be for you. I recommend you take guitar lessons and leave this promotional gimmick video for someone else to buy."
3,o.k,This movie was just o.k. for me. She was like a millie mouse who let her husband abuse her and done nothing. I was like get a back bone will you. But it was just o.k.
3,Contorting to create a thematic connection,Some very interesting information and some beautiful images but the filmmakers really stretched and contorted to create a thematic connection between astronomy and astronomers and the women searching for the remains of their loves ones in the deserts.
1,poor quality,"This lights are poor quality. They are not 1/2 inch and when you finely get them installed, when installing wire connectors the barbs push into plastic shell."
4,Keith Wyatt is a good teacher,"When I bought this product I thought I wouldn't be able to go far in learning the guitar because of the reviews that it was too challenging for someone my age. Of course, I was wrong. This dvd tells you important parts of playing the guitar. It also explains about the scales and more. After you have seen the contents of this dvd you will learn basic things like chords. You will need to buy books if you want to learn things that aren't covered in this dvd."
5,Electric Guitar DVD,"This video is really great. I knew what I was getting as I had borrowed this DVD from my local library and decided I should have my own copy. I also ordered a second copy to give as a gift. Seeing and hearing a guitar being played by someone who knows what they're doing is a big advantage over trying to learn only from a book. I am very pleased with this video and would highly recommend it to any novice guitar player. I am not happy, however, that the plastic DVD case was smashed in shipping, though the disc seems to be intact."
4,Great start for beginners,This DVD is great. I now have an understanding of how to play that no book could ever teach me. You won't be disappointed if you buy it. Keith Wyatt really knows his stuff and is an awesome teacher.
1,"Content may be good, but I'll never know!","I had high hopes when I ordered this DVD and whilst what content I HAVE seen is fine, as far as it goes, it's hardly 'basic instruction', but more than that the DVD is difficult to navigate and like someone else said it seems to revert to Spanish for some inexplicable reason. No good, whatsoever."
3,Not Good for beginners like me,"I bought at the same time I bought my guitar for dummies kit from Amazon. I read the book that came with my kit then popped this in my DVD player, figuring it would be a visual explanation of what I read with a little more in-depth knowledge. I was sorely mistaken. Don't get me wrong this is a good training tool, IF you know the basics about Guitars, which I do not yet.The instructor on the DVD doesn't talk or teach as if he is teaching a beginner he flies right thought the lessons, and the visual pictures Fender gives you are nothing more then a quick flash, which I would have to rewind then pause so I could see the finger positions for chords."
5,Great for elementary age children,"I purchased two different kinds of goggles at the same time. These have far outlasted the others, so I purchased another round of these. I purchased them for children ages 7-10, and they've worked great. They are easy to adjust and seem to fit their faces fine."
4,Loved the taste and consistency,"My husband and I loved the tasted and consistency. We ran out of this and had a can of the regular and thought the extra fat made it stick to the roofs of our mouths--yuck! My only reason for 4 stars is that it still contains a lot of fat. If we eat this though, we're just careful the rest of the day. As long as you plan your meals, it's great. Highly recommend."
5,Quick and crushed delivery timeline!,Very pleased...not only did the seller beat the delivery timeline but book was in very good condition...will do business again with them.
3,John Berry's music is great,"Why this is on a dvd, (with no video) is a mystery.Why not sell it as a CD and let it go at that?"
1,Terrible,"Do not waste ur money on this product. Did not help at all with CT or TE. In fact, I could barely do the exercises due to the pain. I reboxed and sold on ebay."
2,Good Idea but...,"Exercises that extend rather than contract (squeeze) are great for tennis elbow and tendonitis in the forearm. I'm a guitar player and these exercises have given me priceless relief. When I saw this item I had to have it and it worked great for about 5 mins. Then the band snapped. This is cheap junk. Great idea. Poor materials. I was very disappointed. I've since been using a couple of size ""64"" rubber bands from Office Depot. A few mins every day does the trick."
2,it is okay,"The strong point of this video is Karen's no-nonsense instruction. She does not give you a lot of personal philosophy or new age fluff. Her instruction is clear and the cues are clean. That said, there is nothing special in this video, but it is a clean and enjoyable workout.I have another video of Karen's from her pre surgical enhancement days and though her body fat index is waaaay too low in both videos (you can county every muscle, ligament, vein and tendon on her body), this one has the addition of ""plastic surgery enhancements"" that just make it more obvious. It doesn't look good, it isn't healthy and actually, it is kind of sad. Karen is a talented and beautiful trainer, it is too bad she has fallen for this sort of ""ideal""."
2,More encyclopedia,I bought it by mistake and meant to buy connected. Full though of interesting historical facts and some guiding principles for inventors.
4,still needed,"If you've got a wall phone, you need a long cord. This does the job & it's cheap enough to replace when it gets too tangled."
1,RCA 25' cord,"I purchased this cord to go with the new AT&T phone I purchased. All though this cord was at a great price it was defective. The person on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me but I could hear them. At first I thought there was a problem with the phone, so I put the original cord back on the phone and it works perfectly. I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,james Brown Funk Book,"Good book, but I would have liked the CD to be includedand not all his songs are in the book."
1,Mildred Jordan,"It was not the Mildred Jordan I was looking for. I wanted information about author ""Mildred Jordan"" who lived in Reading PA. The information was not worth $1.50."
1,Not So Secret Garden,"Have you ever seen a sequal to a movie and thought there was not really an opening for part two in the first one? Well this is one of those movies. I am not saying don't watch I am just saying if you liked the first one don't get you're hopes to high, it is nothing like it. I am not entirely sure why it is called back to the secret garden since the garden is no longer a secret but whatever."
1,a fan of the first,"this is by far the worst moive I've seen. I LOVE the first secret garden. No one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl. It's a classic. But this sequel is terriable. It controdicts the first moive. It takes the magic away. If you liked the origanl, first moive don't watch this, it will take the magic out of the first moive."
5,One of my daughter's favorites.,My daughter read the book in school and then I found the movie. it is one of her favorite movies to watch.
4,Radar eflectorm,"The quality, delivery and facility of the Echomaster standard radar reflector was great ! It was delivered as promised through Amazon, the assembly was straightforward and it works great."
2,Not much taste,"Not a strong taste of either vanilla or Rooibos. I've tried three other Rooibos teas, and they all taste better than this one. It's drinkable, so I rate it two stars and not one star. I won't buy this one again."
1,Not Reliable!,"I had the same ""Carriage Jam"" problem just after one year. Unable to fix. A google search found that this is a very common problem with this machine."
2,Outdated - don't accept even if free,"I'm a Step by Step fan. These are great guides and they get you going quickly although with some pain. This one is outdated though, and it's worth getting a more recent edition."
4,Brief introduction to Newton,"Gleick's biography of Newton serves as a solid, albeit brief, introduction to one of the world's greatest scientific geniuses. The author touches on all of Newton's major points, from his groundbreaking work in physics and calculus, to his peculiar personality traits, his insecurities, and vicious fights with other contemporary scientists such as Hooke and Liebniz.The book makes use of excellent source material, and the footnotes are excellent. The major complaint with the book is that it is too brief, and does not fully explore Newton's life to any signficant depth. However, it does serve a brief introduction that enables the reader an overview of Newton, and a springboard to seek out more detailed accounts should the reader desire."
3,Yet another Newton biography,"If you've never read a biography of Newton, this one will do fine. If you've ready anything on the subject before, you've basically read everything that is in this book.This book is nothing special. I had high hopes given the awesome jobs James Gleick did withGenius: The Life and Science of Richard FeynmanandChaos: Making a New Science. I didn't learn anything new about Newton's life. I was particularly disappointed at the lack text devoted to Newton's scientific discoveries. What happened during the 2 years when Newton was back home in Lincolnshire? How did he go from ordinary Trinity College student to inventor of Newtonian mechanics? Gleick knows just as much as everyone else does on the subject."
3,Doesn't capture enough of the inner-Newton,"There were moments in this book, but overall I was left a bit disappointed by the author's lack of insight into the man himself. I have always held Newton in awe, and wondered what his IQ might have measured. Perhaps what I was looking for in this book was not the author's intent in focus. I've read many scientific books that detail the theories and history of Newton's contributions. In this book I hoped to find more of an inner glimpse into Newton's psyche. What it did reveal was disillusioning--Newton was apparently petty, jealous, and socially inept. For those who are looking for a biography, this doesn't cut the mustard. For those who are not already familiar with the scientific thought of the day and with Newton's accomplishments, this book will be much more satisfying."
4,Honesty meets rationalism,"I found this book hard to follow in places, but because James Gleick places you so close to Isaac Newton, I found it impossible to give up reading it. According to other reviews, the struggles between Newton and the philosophy of Descartes, and the personality of Hooke, and the possible plagarism of Leibnitz, are not new or unknown. They were to me. Another thing that I didn't understand about the times that Newton lived in was how his society and culture was so steeped in mysticism and the occult. Newton set his philosophy apart from the rest by strictly defining all of the terms that he used. So, while religions and other faith philosophies thrive on the dishonesty of wordplay, science, as defined by Newton's approach, rules the day."
5,Outstanding...,"You have to wonder at a world where a cd like Purple Onion is overlooked. While far from perfect, there are so many great songs that the cd easily earns five stars.Where to start? Well, how about ""David Makalaster"", the ten o'clock newscaster, who reminds us that ""anarchy is back in style""? Or, perhaps, ""Whamola"" - which I like to think of as Les' cautionary tale about conformity, though the song is almost without lyrics! ""Buzzards of Green Hill"", ""Long in the Tooth"", ""Ding Dang"" and the closer ""Cosmic Highway"" are all outstanding tracks. The rest of the songs are...um...merely good.I don't always know what Les is getting at, but I'm up for going along for the ride."
4,Les is a disturbed individual!!!,"Wow, this was an impressive album, and I can't say I'm surprised. Purple Onion is a pot of eclectic musicianship. If you like Primus and Les' other projects, you won't be disappointed. The best track may be the mostly-instrumental song, ""Whamola"". ""D's Diner"" was a blast as well as ""Ding Dang"". Oh, the whole thing was good! I hope Les continues on for years to come."
2,Cheep plastic poor design.,"Power cord cap is hard to secure on to cable, doesn't fit very well on to plug to protect it. Today went to plug in heater and the little plastic strap broke. Now I have no way to secure cap to cable:("
5,Fantastic Fun,This book is full of hilarious poems that have kept my 8 year old son asking for more. The book is on his summer reading list from school.
4,Teachers! What a great resource,"Teachers, this is a poetry book for you to use in your classroom. Being a new teacher, I was fretting about my approach to teaching poetry and making it enjoyable for all my students! I use this book in two lesson plans. In the first lesson plan, I split the class into small groups and gave them a poem to act out for the class. The second, I gave them a poem about an amazing elephant and they had to use the details from the poem to illustrate what the elephant looked like! They enjoyed the lessons tons! I think the key to the success of the lessons was that the poems I used from this book were kid-friendly and funny!"
5,The funniest poems ever.,"A pizza the size of the sun, has some of the best poems that I have ever read. Although the best one is the main one. It is the pizza the size of the sun. Even though the poems are for younger kids they are great for all ages. If you like poems you should pick up a copy of this book. I recommend this book for anyone who loves poems. Jack Prelutsky could'nt have writen this book any funner."
4,Pretty decent for the price,My wife likes the face shield and the color...and the fit is decent. Seems to run just a little small.
5,Helmet review,"I bought the silver one first, got a new red bike and ordered the wine color. I love this helmet, put the flip up to feel the wind on my face, and down when there is road work going on so I don't get shmacked by some gravel. I got the small because I weigh 130 and have a very small head, it fits great and looks great. The red is not a dark wine as you can see from the pictures, it is a solid vivid red and matches my vulcan perfectly. Also loved the price, saved me at least 50 bucks."
1,Beware the alleged warranty,"I purchased the Canon SD850 IS 6 months ago and have used it regularly. It suddenly stopped working - the lens would not retract. I sent it to Canon for service under their one year warranty. They decided that it would not be ""economically feasible"" to repair the camera and have sent it back to me still broken. Canon ""customer care"" says that the technicians found ""water damage"" even though the camera was never around water and worked fine up until the moment it stopped. Clearly, if they don't want to repair something a customer sends back they can just say ""water damage"" and they are off the hook. No recourse for me, no appeal process, nothing for me to do but warn others. It was a nice little camera, but if it is only going to last 6 months,forget about it."
5,a great little camera!!,"My daughter and son-in-law take alot of pictures and they love this camera. It takes great video, too. They got some great shots in New Orleans before the big LSU game and took some video."
4,Great camera...broke easily,"I bought this camera b/c I had lost my previous digital elph (which I loved and had for over 2 yrs). I am a mom of two and I use my camera all the time. I like the size and ease of use for this camera. It took great pics! I loved everything about it until......I dropped it. I was sitting and trying to grab my camera in a hurry and I dropped it. It was turned on...therefore my lens was out. Well, I tried to turn it off and then on again. I got an error message ""lens error, restart your camera"". When I turned off the camera the lens would not retract. It stayed in the same position. I called Dell and since have shipped it off to get an estimate on repairs. If they can determine that it was dropped then I would have to pay for repairs out of pocket. Bad news...I will be without my camera for 2-3 weeks. I have since decided that I would buy another one if the repairs are too costly.Bottom line...great camera....just don't drop it!"
5,This camera amazes me,"I spent way too many hours researching which camera to buy. My first digital was in 1999 when I bought a Fuji. It finally fell apart. I figure I got my money's worth. Before the world of digital I had a Nikon. Although my Fuji was great it never equaled my Nikon. Nothing did until I got this Canon. I love it. My pictures are clear, crisp, and accurate. I have found it easy to use and adapt to."
2,Not sure if i got what i payed for!,"Everything about this purchase was great. Great price, fast delivery. However... the product did not come as I had expected. The box was not sealed. I'm assuming that the product was refurbished. This site was espot deals with a different name. On this site, it said that the product would be factory sealed and brand new. Nothing is wrong with the camera and it works perfectly."
1,Image Quality is so bad... Red eye in every picture..,"Guys,I am not Pro in this but I can see the images/photos and can tell you that this is not a GOOD camera. I am not sure I got the bad piece or this camera is like that. I have taken around 500 photos now and see half photos has red eyes. Even after IS, photos are so blurred sometimes.And if you are taking photos in house with less light or in the evening, forget ur fotos.Also if u got places where there is lot of light like Rockerfeller plaza I went to see Xmas tree. The fotos came so dull. After so much light around the flash went off and the pics are backinsh. When I manually did the flash off, the foto is better. I might be doin something wrong here or this is not the good camera. U DECIDE. But from my side , I give only one *."
5,Canon sd850-excellent camera,This is an amazing camera for a compact. It gives beautiful detailed pics with absolute amazing colors and nice feature with the image stabalization.Very happy with this purchase at an amazing price.
4,Convenient and easy to use.,"I bought this camera for a trip and I have been playing with it for a month prior and wow is it easy and quick to use! The size is perfect to take anywhere, the speed is amazing, and the pictures are great. It's the perfect travel pocket camera for who ever wants a really easy to use camera that takes great pictures! You must be a bit technical because there are a lot of adjustments but that's what makes a good camera even better! The panorama option stitches pictures together amazingly for really cool 360 degree views! So far I love this camera, its great for that quick picture with out a cumbersome bulky camera to lug around!"
3,No longer focusing,"After a few years of good service, it no longer focuses. Heard this problem echoed by many others - some with far less service on their camera. For goodness sakes, I have a Pentax that I bought in 1968 that still works fine!!!"
5,great camera nice performance,I bought three Canon and one Sony camera so far. I like this one and will rate it at the top due to its higher quality performance. No problem found so far and easy to use.
4,Love it,"I am in love with this camera, it does everything that I want. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because every now and again I get a very blurry picture (probably my fault)."
4,I love this camera!,"Graduated from the kodak family - and am so glad I did. I originally tried the Nikon, but returned it. I could have purchased the 1100 series, but all the reviews and conversations I had with camera people said this was the better choice. Awesome camera for the money..."
5,Great Camera @ a great price,Great Camera @ a great priceCanon PowerShot SD850 IS 8.0 MP Digital Elph Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom
2,"it's alright,but not a must have","Maybe my kids are just a little old- at 4 and 5, they have no interest in it what-so-ever. The 4 yr old likes the train, but for about 30 seconds once every 60 days or so. It is packed in our cupboard and only comes out when a child is trying to get a toy that is behind it.However- making copies of pages is not necessary- you can print more pages from the original coloring books online. Only if you want different pages ( like Pooh or whatever there are) do you need to buy the added things."
3,My Only Problem,"My only problem with this pool is that when we set everything up and began filling it up, we noticed a small pin sized hole. Now, I dont mind using the repair kit to fix it, but how long do those kits really last?? I am kind of upset that we ran into this issue. For $345 I guess I expected to be the one who put the hole in it...silly me!"
4,Great fun!,"We purchased this pool end of season last year. I'm only writing this review a year later b/c I'm so impressed with the durability of this product. My 3 kids ages 5, 7, & 9 have lots of room its so much fun. Believe me my kids and their friends give this pool a beating and it has stood up to it. I have not had a problem with the filter but you do need to keep up with chemicals it is a real pool but I'm used to it by now. Overall for the price it can't be beat and I love the fact that I can take it down after the summer and reclaim my yard! BTW my pool went up in less than an hour and even without leveling the ground no complaints here."
1,Junk Don't waste your hard earned money,"I thought I loved this pool even after the first one had leaks at the seams upon fill up. I had to take it down and return it, then only after one season of use and then stored the second one is bad too. I set up the pool exactly one year later after proper storage and care. OH BOY, now I have two leaks on the seams, no way to patch, INTEX says TOO BAD, no warranty, just a 90 day defect policy, go figure, they already have my money. If you think you are going to use this more than once forget it. This is typical foreign made junk and the company who made it could care less that you spent your hard earned money. Buy something that will last don't by an INTEX of any kind"
2,not 30 inches,"This pool is 28 inches high, not 30. Why are they allowed to misrepresent the actual size and get away with it??? This is my second intex pool. My first purchase, last summer, cost me over $1500.00 and was way too big; now this one is too small -sigh! It's for my two small children, but they can't go in there alone so I do need to be in there with them so I'm not happy about this height. Also, the image is deceiving. Look at the adults in the pool. It looks like the water is coming up to their abs when they're standing, but in reality the pool comes up to my thigh!"
3,24 x 52 Intex round metal frame pool,"Instructions for set-up could be written with more clarity. Pool asslemby took longer than stated and getting the last fitting in place around the metal ring was trying! The biggest challenge was ground prep. I would suggest using blocks to place under the legs of the frame as the poles wanted to settle into the sand & ground, resulting in less than level set-up! The pump system just dosn't seem to have enough power to circulate the pool water and I have had some problems keeping the pool clear. The ladder that comes with the pool isn't all that sturdy. This is my first season with the pool so I can't comment on durrability yet. The pool was delivered promtly and intact. It is very spacious and we have had a family pool party with 5 adults and 3 children in the pool at one time and had more than enough room to swim & splash around (even had several pool rafts & toys. Overall I'm satisified with the pool and have no regrets buying it."
1,Don't Waste Your time!,"I purchased this book based on the reviews I read here. I'll never make that mistake again!Don't waste your time and money on this book. I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. The plot is juvenile, the dialogue is preposterous.It's rare I don't finish a book, but when a character tells someone,in 1953,that their room has a microwave oven, I threw the book down in disgust!"
3,This book isn't one of k. A. Applegate's books but is good.,I liked the book but K. A. applegate has written better books than this on. It is very exiting like all the rest but i am still thinking that # 15 is the most exiting. these books are getting boringer because I always know they are going to survive but I always think and never know how they get though.
3,Not Rex Stout's best work,"Written at the end of Rex Stout's career, this book simply does not hold up when compared to Stout's earlier work. While Nero Wolfe and Archie are still quite likeable, the plot is somewhat convoluted and doesn't provide a satisfying conclusion. Nero Wolfe has been on some memorable adventures; this just isn't one of them. This book is worth reading for a true Rex Stout fan, but I wouldn't recommend it to a newcomer or a casual fan. There are just too many superior options."
3,"Update the pictures, please!!!","I take first year German at Noblesville Middle School and this is the book we use. It was written in the '80s and has the tackiest clothes in the world, nevertheless it is a pretty good book to use when treaching German. I find the vocabulary at the end of each chapter extremelly helpful."
2,Excited/Dissapointed,"MY 7 month old baby girl,Emily Madison,was very interested in the drum for something to hit on and make noise.If you want this drum for just that reason,it is great.As for playing with it to learn your alphabet or numbers,it's a flop.The music interferes with the counting and alphabet.Also,when your child beats on the drum the letters and numbers are announced as fast as he or she hits the drum.It tends to get bothersome.It wasnt fun for Emily or her 4 year old cousin, Alysin, after the first 15 minutes.I offer the drum for them to play with,but it always is the toy that doesnt get much enjoyment.I have learned by trial and error by purchasing other toys as well.I hope this review helps.Kelli Arigoni"
3,ok but not a favorite,"My son plays with it but loses interest. I like the idea behind it but it just didn't turn out to be a ""favorite""!"
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I love leapfrog toys and we have purchased several different things for our son and for others as gifts. Since our 10 month old loves to bang everything he can get his hands on, we thought he would love this. But, we've had it for a few months and so far he has shown little interest in it. Also, even the ""quiet"" music setting is pretty loud."
4,Great music toy,"My parents (my daughter's day-care providers) bought this for my 1 year old daughter when she was about 9 months old. She has played with this toy everyday from day one. She enjoys the lights and the noise it makes. She's still a little young to understand the numbers and alphabet connection, but I'm sure this toy is helping her build an understanding of those sounds every day. My parents give this 2 thumbs up and anything that holds my (very very) active daughter's imagination is number one with me! I love that the learning factor will continue to be there for my daughter as she grows and develops."
2,"Good idea, boring toy.","I was very excited to get this for my one year old last Christmas. He showed little to no interest in it, however. The quiet setting is still pretty loud. Once the toy goes to ""sleep"" you can't wake it up without moving the switch to a different mode, which small children can't do. We have since had another baby, and he doesn't find this toy interesting, either, even at almost one. I'm keeping it around for another year or so, in case someone decides to play with it."
3,My 9 year old likes this drum better than the 8 month old.,This drum is really cute and eventually I'm sure it will teach my son his numbers and abc's but right now he's not interested in it at all. When my 9 year old plays w/ it w/ him he seems to like the cute music it plays so it amuses him that way.
3,Liked but not loved it!,"This drum was a good idea, but my 6mth old had to pound quite hard to make the drum light up. The lights were not bright enough to keep his attention like some of the other toys he has that are really eyecatching and keeps him enthralled. Maybe when he is older and can really pounce on it will it have the right effect. But for a 6mth old and now he is 8mths he is not really that interested in it, even after we have tried many times to engage him in playing with it. I suggest it for older kids."
3,"Okay, but...",My son enjoys this toy for a few minutes at a time. He does have toys that he will play with for longer periods of time and so I think they are better suited for him.
3,Learning Drum,"I only gave this toy 3 stars on the fun scale due to the fact that my son gets easily bored with it.My friend's bought this toy for my son when he was 8months, now that he is a year old he plays with it more than he did. It is great educational value for learning the ABC's and 123's. I really like the toy and hope that he will start to play with it more."
5,SOooooooo MUCH FUN,My son enjoys this drum very much. As soon as he got it he was amazed by the sound music and lights. It is easy for them to understand. It is a perfect gift or just to get to keep the little one busy.
5,Great toy for learning and for the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have a 8 month old girl, and she received this toy for christmas. she is playing with this toy every chance she gets. it teaches the abc's and the 123's and she dances to it when you put it on the music section. Very good toy for the money. I would recommend this toy to any who has a child."
3,Noisy Drum,I purchased this item as a gift for my neighbor's 7 month old daughter. My neighbors and I both found the drum to be more on the noisy and annoying side. It kept repeating itself and got boring for their daughter. The one positive thing about it is that it is educational and teaches kids the alphabets and numbers!
4,Drum for the ACTIVE two year old,"AS written in other reviews, 8-9 month olds would probably not enjoy this toy. We have this and this exactly happened. Before junking the drum, I re- gave it to my active son. (now 26 months)He Loves it and sings with it. HE also Whacks it!"
3,Wear earplugs!,"My 14 month old son plays with this, probably every day, for about 5 minutes at a time. He likes to bang on it, and likes the music and lights, but I don't think he gets much from it. Like other reviewers, I think the combination of music and letter or number names mudies the waters. I also find the children's voices on this drum ANNOYING. They say things like ""Hit the drum! It's fun!"" to try to entice kids to return to the toy once they've lost interest. There's also very fake-sounding kids laughter, and the volume is very, very high, though there are high and low settings. I find nearly all electronic toys too loud and often end up putting tape over the speaker in addition to using the low setting, which gives about the right volume for me. I would recomment Leap Frog's Alphabet Pal, which has more truly education fare. (If you can't tell, though, I prefer non-electronic toys, so perhaps my judgement is too biased.)"
2,"Durable, but not much fun","My child played with this toy very little compared to the other educational/activity type toys she has. She was bored with it very quickly. My daughter has a lot of the Leap Frog products, this one just doesn't compare to Leap Frog's other toys in the same age catagory. Keep shopping, there is something out there more fun for your little one."
2,an okay toy,"I am the nursery director for my church and also a soon to be mom. I bought this toy b/c I had seen it being used by one of the children at their home. I must say that it's okay for children who like to just hit something. A lot of times, I find that the children don't hit it hard enough to make it change scenes. So, I would say that it's not very educational if they can't make it work, and it is annoying. I suggest, find something else if the child likes hitting things."
4,We love this toy!,"I bought this toy for my son at 10 months old. He loves it. He loves the drum section and the music. I'm sure when he gets a little older the numbers and letters will please him more, but he plays with it every day. Great toy!"
4,My son still loves this toy!,"I bought this drum for my son when he was 6 months old. He loved it then and still loves it at 14 months. True, the songs and children's voices are annoying at times, but they're not annoying to my son. This toy continues to be in his top ten favorite toys to play with."
4,WHY THE HANDLE?,"OUR DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOY. WE ESPECIALLY LIKE HOW IT KEEPS INTERACTING WITH SARAH EVEN WHEN SHE IS NOT HITTING THE DRUM AND HOW THE DRUM APPLAUDS HER FOR GETTING SOMETHING CORRECT. ONE QUESTION THOUGH - WHAT THE HEC IS THE HANDLE FOR? WHOEVER DESIGNED IT SHOULD REALIZE THAT KIDS THIS AGE LIKE TO PICK UP EVERYTHING AND PUT IT IN THEIR MOUTH AND HIT THEIR HEADS WITH IT. WITHOUT A HANDLE, THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TO THAT. AFTER ALL, KIDS THIS AGE AREN'T EVEN WALKING YET, SO THEY COULDN'T EVEN CARRY THE DRUM IF THEY WANTED TO. THIS SEEMED VERY ODD TO US AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND REDESIGNING THE WHOLE HANDLE CONCEPT."
4,great toy but shuts off too easily,"My daughter received this as a christmas gift. I loved it as soon as I saw it. She's 7 months old and likes to bang everything...now she has this cute little drum toy to bang on..what a great idea! She bangs it and it talks back and flashes numbers/letter/patterns. Awesome toy. The only thing I don't like is that it shuts off within 10-15 seconds, if it's not being banged! So I have to keep moving the slider to restart it for my daughter...that's a little annoying...so I give it 4 stars...otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Oh, by the way just because it's a leapfrog, doesn't make this a learning toy for an infant! it's just a lights & sounds toy. An infant is not going to learn numbers and letters from any toy, not matter how ingenious. It's just a fun toy and a great idea for infants that love to bang on everything anyway."
3,A sturdy toy but has some flaws,"My son got this for his 1st X-mas, when he was about 6 mos old. He liked it but a parent has to turn it on/off & set the mode. It was nice to have both lights & music but there are better toys to encourage music appreciation. I thought it was okay but too expensive considering it doesn't really grow with your child. I prefer toys that you can use @ many stages & this toy was limited for that purpose, unless you count using the handle to throw it! I would not recommend it."
5,Great toy!,"My son loves this drum he's 13 months and has had it since he was 10 months. It's entertaining and educational. Plus, it has volume control!"
2,Just OK!,I got this for my nephew when he was about 6 months old and he only played with it for a month. It is extremely loud and gets annoying after a while.
2,Can be annoying,This is the sort of gift that grandparents buy their grandchildren ... although I would imagine that banging on this drum would be better than banging on a glass table.
1,Surprisingly not as much fun as I had hoped,"I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 9 month. She didn't really play with it then and 3 months later, still doesn't. The drum noise is not distinct. I think I enjoyed the music option more than she did. My daughter loves music toys, just not this one. The drum needs to be hit rather hard, maybe this is better suited for a boy."
3,"Good, not great","This toy is good for babies who get into that whack-things mode. I have to say that the fact that there are only two song types total for all 4 of the play modes is pretty annoying. I've noticed that, other than when she wants to hit it with another toy for the added smack to go with the sound (it's hard to get it to play on the top, otherwise). If you want a good drum to play with, there are better ones out there that I've seen."
4,"16 months old, and she still likes it","This one has been a big hit for our daughter. The music is good, but she loves the voices. It also applauds for her when she hits it. At first I thought twenty bucks was a lot for a drum, but now I'd happily spend it again for the hours of entertainment it's afforded her."
5,Terrific educational and entertaining toy!,"This toy is a terrific entertainer - my 10 month-old son has used this almost daily since about 5 months old. We change the settings so he spends time on numbers, ABC's, music, and rhythm. I like how sensitive it is to his little hands so he doesn't have to beat on it hard to make it work (though he does anyway!) It has an automatic shut off so that the batteries last VERY long! Great volume control - also, it can be played on its' side, upside down or pretty much any way as long as it is being banged on. We will buy another for future children if this one ever gets worn out. It's worth noting: we've got our money's worth many times over already in just 5 months."
2,Not user Friendly for 6 month old,"I read the reviews and thought this would be the perfect gift for my 6 month old daughter at Christmas. I was very dissapointed in the amount of time it's on before it automatically turns off. To turn it on you press a star shaped button and it begins to do it's little song and dance. However if my daughter doesn't hit the drum in a time frame of about a minute it shuts off. She knows how to hit the drum and will crawl over to it and start hitting it to play but then gets disapointed when it doesn't make any noise. At 9 months, she still hasn't learned to press the button to make it start. She'd play with it more if her patting it started it up again."
4,Would be better if it stayed on longer.,"My son really enjoys this toy...when it stays on! It shuts off so quickly, that if he turns his attention elsewhere for just a second, it shuts off. In order to get it to work again, you have to turn the button on the side to another activity. He is not old enough to understand this, (he's only 10 mos.), so if I don't sit RIGHT with him, he loses interest quickly."
3,Dad likes it more than daughter,"Our 8 month old daughter hits it a few times and then turns to something else. She doesn't stay engaged, but Dad thinks it's fun to play! I like that it shuts itself off after 30 sec. Maybe she'll like it when she's 1+years and can relate to the abc's and 123's (function) better."
1,"Not fun, not helpful. Just awful.","I don't want a kitschy coffee table book full of pix of a lot of godawful rooms. But that is what I inadvertently bought when I picked this up. Fine, so this guy has an attitude and wants to thumb his nose at the world. Good for him. But I'm just out of college and looking for cool ideas and help so I can start living the way I want to live. This book was a costly mistake. Cool isn't cool if it's bad taste, ya know."
1,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,"I saw this book when we staged a Bad Taste Shower for two friends who were getting married and buying their first home. We all had to bring some of the worst stuff we could find at Salvation Army, etc., but the grand finale was this book, which someone found at amazon. The entire book is full of bad taste, and it's a hoot to look at. If the author meant it as a joke, it's great! If he is serious, he ought to be condemned. This just shows that anyone, qualified or not, can publish a home decorating book. Buyer beware!"
4,Strange fun,"This is an odd collection of decorating ideas, personal style and art that amuses and thrills. I would never decorate my home with some of these projects, but it's great fun to leave around as a coffee table book. Excellent text and photos, the cover is textured and has a cut out which shows the quality of the this book. A good gift for the fun loving artist in your life, even if it's you."
1,Simply bad design,"JUNK is cool. JUNKY is not. This book simply shows one junked-up place after another, missing the point that finding cool castoffs and so-called junk from the curb or flea market can produce really personal, really interesting living spaces. The places in this book disappoint because what are touted as real places to live come off as unedited junkyards, not to mention unlivable so-called ""homes"" created simply for effect and not for life. A stupid book on which I wasted my money. I'd give this a minus 2 if I could."
1,A disservice to consumers,"I am a designer, and what my customers need is not a book that encourages decorating anarchy. Being free from rigid rules and old-fashioned design ideas is great, but it is amazing how many times I see rooms that look like those in this book when I am called in on a job. People want help in pulling it all together,but this book simply shows how to throw it all around. It's a mess. Yuk. I can't even think of anyone to give my copy to."
5,Awesomely Inspiring!,I bought this book at a local store about a year and a half ago and I still love it! It has great ideas for unique transformations and decorating for every type of room. It includes project instructions for many of the featured items shown. I have also found that it is a great conversation piece. Everyone who comes into my home picks up this book and is fascinated by the ideas inside. I definetely recommend it!
2,The name... You are just paying for the name,"I ordered numerous of these items of different gauges and it appeared they put more money into the package to look flashy vs. the quality of the terminals. They were very light weight and by no means were they rated for the gauge wire which they were sold. I'm using these in non-car audio applications, but regardless of the application, none of the monster terminals were rated at what they were sold for. I ended up buying some non-monster terminals and have since thrown these away. They were useless.Corey"
1,Terrible taste,I was very disappointed with this purchase. These toothpicks have a terrible taste.Please do not waste your money on them.
5,Your products are very good and the services too,Your products are very good and the services too. I hope buy in the future in your mall Congratulations. Good bye
4,Love these jeans,"This must be at least the 5th pair of 518's I have purchased, I am unsure whether that is good or bad! I have a tendency to wear them away along the inner thigh so have to keep replacing. I love the style of these jeans, I like that they come in different lengths and they usually are available in some good colours. They are quite stretchy and like other reviewers have said you do keep having to hoist them up at the waist."
2,This Particular Fabric Does Not Hold Up!,"I have several pairs of the Levi's 518 Superlow Boot Cuts, but this pair was different. At first, I really liked the lighter ""summer"" weight of the fabric, but once I had them on for a few hours, they completely sagged off of me! Something is wrong with the elasticity of the spandex content...These will not keep their shape and stand up for a full 8 hours."
2,Levi's 518 rinses,"I bought a pair of 518's from Amazon and when I got them, they looked so cheap and the hemming was horrible. According to levi.com, amazon.com is NOT an authorized seller of Levi's jeans, which means you are apt to get a fake. It's not hard to tell. The fabric is a good place to start, and the fit. I sent them back and of course, I got a refund, but I just wanted people to know they may not be getting what they think they paid for."
4,"Great, but size was not as expected!","I really like how this model adapts and shapes my body. I'm petite lady, 120 lbs, with a medium butt. I was trying to substitute the an old Levis I been wearing for a year with a ""clon"", that is, with a new Levis same model and same size. I was a little bit disappointed with the size! I thought Even if my old levis 518 has loosed up a little with use, the new one I got is larger. It doesn't fit as well as my old one, even if it looks very with the help of a nice belt. I wish I had gotten it in a smaller size. If you had some butt and not too small of a waist, and you are petite, this may look good on you -as it does on me. It might be just mine, but I will definitely size down next time!"
1,"Didn't know 518's came in skinny, but too small anyway","I've ordered 518's for a couple of years, different washes, etc. When ordering this, it showed up at 518, so I ordered. Arrived skinny and too small even though I ordered the same size I always order. Probably okay for toothpicks :)"
2,Disappointed,I ordered the Nomad and the color looks much better online. The pants seemed used. I'm really disappointed.
3,Weren't super low..,The pants weren't super low as they are labeled on here the ones I recieved were just low rise. Which hits right under the belly button..and they fit great when you first put them on but after about an hour of wearing them they stretch out and get really loose... but other than that I like them..
4,What Makes Her So Special,"I use this CD as an award on my internet talk show. People get a choice between this album and a Barell of Monkeys, the Hasbro toy. People seem to choose the Barell of Monkeys more. So, that should tell you something about this album."
5,sterling silver bead chain,This item was shipped and received very quickly. The necklace is exactly as I pictured and was very good quality. Overall a great experience.
2,schmaltz,"one tune is worthwhile on this recording & even that is ruined by one of the worst poems(?) ever committed to vinyl. this was the best the moody's ever got, too. what a pathetically awful band ..."
1,Not the same Gumby we saw as kids. Dissapointing.,"If you loved the original Gumby then don't buy this item. It will only break your heart. None of the original voices, music, or sound effects are used in this DVD. All the sound is re-recorded and has none of the charisma or excitement as the original sound I loved as a kid. I can still hear the original funky sound effects in my head, and when I heard the sound on this DVD, I was shocked and dissapointed that I had wasted my money. As far as I know, all the episodes are here and in good quality, however without the original sound it is not the Gumby I saw as a kid. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM."
2,Mozart knew best,"Apparently, Klemperer thought he knew better than Mozart what should be included in this opera, as well as the correct pacing, irrespective of what the score might indicate. It's really tough to make Mozart boring, but this performance comes close. It drags when it should sparkle, and distorts when it should clarify. Example: it's hard for the Queen to sound angry when she practically has to gasp for breath due to the slow pacing. Others in the cast range from good to just OK, but the conductor (and lack of dialogue) really put this recording out of the running."
1,Flimsey Breyer Rider,"I purchased this rider as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. It lasted one (1) day before breaking into two pieces at the waist. This was a big disappointment to both of us,"
1,hated it!,"She uses celebrities extensively as examples of what she's explaining. There is a brief explanation of a concept followed by paragraphs of celebrities who fit. If you took out all of the celebrity references, this book would be about 30 pages long. If you aren't familiar with the major aspects of the personalities of movie stars and politicians, it's more confusing than helpful."
1,Hijacked ballet vis a vis radical science,"This is not a ballet. This a production drawer. In another words, you are ""reading"" cole slaw. Save your money."
4,Delightful to little eyes,"The SF Ballet's version of The Nutcracker is beautifully choreographed and visually appealing. My young daughters (2 & 4) ask to watch it over and over. They love the ""bad guy Mouse King"" and are captivated by the scenery and costumes. Set in SF in the early 1900's, it is definitely on the more playful side which keeps the attention of my little ones. The lighting is brilliant, costumes and background absolutely stunning, and the dancing is captivating. As a parent, I appreciate the fact that my girls are learning to appreciate art both in dance and music. Having seen 3 live performances, this DVD by far has held our attention and kept even the smallest ones entranced. Highly recommended for little viewers and enjoyable for adults as well."
1,private lessons are missing,"Yes, I kinda expect title resemble the movie and if movie cannot deliver dont mislead. The movie is done for mainstream audience and as a result private lessons are missing. Silvia Kristel is supposedly housemaid who supposedly give private lessons in sex education and as all of this is supposedly this flick is waste of my money."
3,Notes bleed through the cheap paper used in this edition.,"If you plan to underline portions of Byron's work or commentin the margins of the text, avoid this edition as any ink""bleeds"" through its poor quality paper (pencil works fine)."
5,To Our Children's Children's Children,"The release of the Moody Blues (Edge,Pender,Thomas,Lodge and Hayward) of this album was like an extention of all of their work from Days of Future Past to that point.The album has more of a theme to it then the others and the joint efforts of all members makes it timeless piece.Let yourself go and listen to the album, you'll find songs running through you head all day long.Truly Moody Blues signature work!"
3,Just OK,"I can't say I agree with most of the glowing reviews. I just don't think the quality is there in this CD. I think the quality of our LP's played on our old stereo system is better. However, this CD is a lot easier to listen to in the car. The extra tracks, I don't think, are all that great. They were ok, just not fabulous."
2,No good for Northeeasterners and midwesterners,"The author of the book dwells on materials and methods that are commonly used only in the southeastern part of the country, where he is from. (He actually recommends heat pumps, which are not a very good bet in the colder parts of the country, he also has very little to say about basements, and seems to discourage them as well). I read the whole book, and I do not feel well prepared to be my own contractor. The author never discusses issues like panelized and modular homes, and that could be a way to simplify construction and save money."
2,Not Much Substance,"Very little to work with here. Covers everything, but with little detail. For instance, there are only six pages in the book on sub-contractors. Search a little more and you can find a different resource that will be much more detail oriented."
3,Good Learning Toy for Infants and Toddlers,This is a good toy for infants and toddlers. My baby is 5 mos old and she is too small to play with it yet but she loves to watch it light up. It plays several really cute kids songs and they are very upbeat songs. It is great for when they are older too because it teaches them shapes and colors! It is a soft toy so it is easy for infants to play with and not get hurt!
4,Well Used Tad!!,"We got my son Baby Tad when he was 6 m.o. (he's now 4) he LOVED it! Tad went everywhere with us! We all really liked the Night time songs but wished they lasted a little longer. He is really soft but if he is to be a crib toy, move him away from the baby at night or you might be woken up to the sounds of Tad as he gets kicked or slept on. We always put him to the foot of the crib that way he would be there to entertain our son in the morning for awhile. We got our daughter a Lily like this but she didn't care for it too much, she liked Tad better but not as much as our son. That was the old Lily btw, not the one that is out now. Overall, I recommend Baby Tad, he was a great toy in our house!"
2,Not interesting to 16 month old,"My son received as a gift when he was 16 months old. He would snuggle with the frog, and looks at the lights. But he would not push the button to hear the songs. He also does not fall asleep to the nightime music. He likes the songs only because I often sing them to him and they sound familiar."
2,"Lasted us a year before breaking down, with little use.","I bought this toy for my son when he turned 1. I use to like to put the sleep mode on before he would go to sleep at night. He is now almost 2 and just recently started to like playing with Baby Tad. Unfortunately the sleep mode no longer works, even after I changed the batteries. I would not recommend buying this toy unless you only intend it to fully work for about a year."
3,"Maybe, maybe not","I love leapfrog toys but this one was very limited for my daughter. It basically teaches six shapes and plays music(It does have a volume control). The buttons are hard to push. It tends to pill. After a year ours stoppped working but that was o.k. because my daughter had long lost interest.Your child may like it for cuddle value though. But my best advice would be to buy it early, when your baby is about three months old or less. Beware that if you use Tad to lull your baby to sleep you'll have to keep going into the room to restart him as he is on a six minute timer. When you hold the reset button down the voice goes through a timer- ""One minute, two minutes, three minutes, etc.. to night-night."" This always disturbed my daughter. Also the flashing lights were too stimulating for bed time."
5,Pure Love,My baby who is 15 months absolutely loves this toy. We put it in the crib with her and she plays with Tad all the time. She loves playing the music and hearing him talk. A must have.
2,disappointed,"On a recent visit, I brought this toy to my fourteen month old granddaughter. She was a good age for it and was able to push the buttons. However, so many songs are introduced by annoying "" I'm Baby Tad"" messages. Even the nice nightime song had a Baby Tad countdown. She by far prefers other musical toys that play melodies for longer times and without the spoken voice. I'll be more carefull ordering toys by mail in the future as what looked rather cute in a small picture seemed almost grotesque full size."
5,toy lover,this toy is very educational. my 12month old daughter got this for her 1st birthday and loves. she dances around when it sings to her. and loves how it lights up in bright colors. this is a must have!!!!!!!!!
5,fantastic,I purchased this for my grandson & he has had it 1 1/2 years & still enjoys it as much as he did at the beginning. He learned very young to press the hand to make it play the lullaby & would do it when he was almost asleep without opening his eyes. He is now a little over 2 & still plays with it in the morning when he wakes up & when he goes to sleep. He will push the correct shapes when asked also it has helped him learn colors & shapes. If they made it washable would be a help. May have to order a new one that is not quite so worn out.
2,That Horrible Frog,"Our nanny calles this toy, ''That Horrible Frog,'' and I couldn't agree more. The music quality is lousy -- how any child would be soothed by the ``nighttime'' music is a mystery to me. It jars my nerves every time I hear it. I think all the LeapFrog products have too a high a ratio of noise to fun. My son prefers his noise-less stuffed frog."
1,Junk,I brought this in Jan for my son who was 5 months old. Fast foward to June where he is 10 months and I have to say that this toy is not working. My son has used this toy as a step to reach for things. The bottoms does not light up He has lost intrest.A waste
2,Where did those good reviews come from?!,"I bought Baby Tad for my 8 mo. old son, and two months later, the toy still gets no use. The buttons are too hard for my boy to press. (He has the strength and coordination to press lots of other buttons, these are just too hard!) Even for me, it takes two coordinated hands to play with the thing, since one hand has to provide the resistence so the other hand can use enough pressure to depress the buttons! It's all made worse by the toy since it gets impatient too fast, switching to different activities and then turning itself off before my child has a chance to respond to it."
5,LOVE IT!!,My son loves Baby Tad for naps and bedtime. The night time music is great. There's no reason to spend so much on crib toys... this is the only one you'll need. My 4 year old daughter still has her's and uses it every night too.
3,Failed to hold the attention of my lil Einstein,My 11 month old boy played with it for about an hour. Now it just sits atop his huge pile of toys. Its a neat little toy if you sit with your child and interact with the device. My child couldnt push the buttons. Lets wait and see after a few months. It seems my boy was more interested in the tag sticking out of Tad's rear (please dont read into this).
3,Better for younger babies... I think,"I bought this for my 11 month old daughter for Christmas. She really doesn't put that much interest in it. She got Lily for Christmas and really likes her better.I think Baby Tad would've been a much better investment if I would have bought it when she was about 3 months old. I love all the songs that it plays and the nighttime option.Just right now.. she's just not enjoying it. But, next time with next baby I'll bring it out early."
3,"A troubling book, but of interest","It seems that Regina Marler wants to side with white males, particularly those white males who are afraid of the great courageous achievements of radical feminist criticism. Her tiresome remarks concerning the radical interpretations of Bloomsbury only expose her own conservatism. The rest of us take joy and pleasure in the fearless work of radical feminists; Regina Marler apparently has chosen to remain backwards."
3,Just didnt make it.,The acting was very good and at no fault to them but once again hollywood has destroyed what otherwise was a pretty good haunting story. The one done in 02 was much better and probably a little more true to what happened. While watching I got the feeling that the story just wanted to hurry up and end but had to much time to kill so any scene it could think of would do. Could of been done better.
3,Meh,"***May Contain Spoilers***This movie felt unbelievably flat. Not enough to make us care about Matt. I wanted to know Jonah (the dude on the cover with ectoplasm streaming from his mouth). All I got was flashes of ""scary"" images with a promise of better things. What's great about scary movies regarding ghosts from the past isn't the paranormal, but rather the history. Give us more of the memento mori, more flashbacks of Jonah contacting spirits. It was never explained why the mortician used voodoo and dark magic. I would assume to make more money by having more ghosts around, but wasn't Jonah a true median anyway? He didn't need extra ghosts to give the clients what they needed. I felt totally cheated when it came to Jonah. The most interesting parts of the film were flashbacks to his life. He looked so scared and confused. I would have much rather watched him deal with his gift and his oppressor than watch Matt and his one-dimensional family interact.Worth watching? Yeah. Sure. Rent it, though."
4,Spooky and Interesting,The movie was scary but not so much that you had to close your eyes. I like Virginia Madsen. The interaction between the son who had cancer and the mother was loving. The way the boy who was ill took on the demons in the house was strong and strange. The chance to work with a psychic without disaster of doom would be fun. The more authentic and real the better. Researching at the library to find history and supernatural info was also cool. The movie is worth a view.
4,A creepy and suspenseful thriller that had me on the edge of my seat!,"The Haunting in Connecticut was a shocking movie, because I expected a dreadful horror movie, but surprisingly it wasn't. As a result it gave me shocks with me jumping in my seat. I recommend this movie to any horror movie lover."
5,the best scary movie i've seen,I am 63 years old and have seen bunches of scary movies. This one (the unrated version) is the near the best. It deserves much better recognition.
3,"Entertaining, but NOTHING like the actual story.","A decent movie if you don't know the real story, but if you're looking for an accurate account of the haunting, read the book. Hollywood butchered this story. It's unfortunate too, because the real story would've made for an unbelievable movie. Probably a little too risque for most people. The entity had been conjured by an undertaker who was having 'relations' with the dead bodies. Controversy aside, the book is very interesting if you like paranormal accounts."
1,a silly book,this is a very very silly book and it is full of lies and it says silly things about my country which I didn't like. It says silly things about fairies and i think the man which wrote it is very unhonest and has never been to our country. it made me feel very sad that people make lots of money writting about my contry because i love my country very muchthey dont know lots of things abotu wales and they get all the spellings and dates and facts wrongsmo fi'n hoffi'r llyfyr yma o gwbwl
4,Excellent Book,"I will admit I was entrigued by the range of reviews. I am a citizen of UK and live in a small village near Hay-on-wye. My parents were English but I consider myself Welsh.This book is an excellent story of a young man's visit to our country and relates how he became a Welsh Witch.The writing is obviously from the heart. It impressed me, and I am not easily impressed.I bought the book, read the book in three days and am trying to contact the author. I rate it very high on my sincerity scale.I think anyone who steps out on lifes stage should get a fair hearing. Obviously those who gave it a bad review had not read it, otherwise they would have reviewed the book instead of the author.The picture that this book paints wants me to look at my Welsh ancestors (I have several) with a new respect. I am also going to learn more about my nations history.GOOD BOOK!"
1,lh,I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS BOOK IF IT WASNT SO FULL OF UNTRUTHS. ITS A PITY COS AFTER A BIT IT JUST GETS TOO MUCH
1,Abysmal,"The book's contents are attrocious. The author doesn't even know where Wales is, let alone the history, culture and language of this beatiful land.As a Welshman, I would urge people NOT to buy this ridiculous pile of tripe. It is an insult to one of the oldest cultures in Europe."
1,comments,after a few pages it became quite obvious that this is almost all fantasy. I couldn't even recognise the places in Wales - even the spellings are terrible.I'm not one of those fluffy bunnies who just believes anything. This really didn't pull the wool over MY eyes.
2,"Bah, Humbug! Baby Brains!",I thought the book was too silly and foolish to be fun. The far out feats and escapades were beyond the realm of believable and it crossed the line for me of what I consider entertaining. This is one time that I disagree with the reviewers.
3,Vet's Best Moisture Mist Conditioner,I just received this yesterday and haven't had a chance to use it. I did spray a little on my dog's coat and she and I both liked the smell.
3,A Bit Long,"This book was very long. The storyline was good however this author describes everything detail by detail. There were times when I couldn't wait to finish it and I hate when I start to feel that way.The winter and ice imagery was incredible. It added to the suspenseful environment. It was something that she kept going right to the end of the book. The chemistry between Shane and Jenna wasn't that hot. There was only one sexual encounter throughout the book but it didn't take away from the story. The strained relatipnship betewwn Jenna and her daughter, Cassie was very realistic. I was very surprised about the identity of the villain.Another thing I didn't like was how it ended. It ended with the start of another mystery.It was an OK read."
4,Schöne Opernrarität,"Wer nur ""Cavalleria rusticana"" von Mascagni kennt, ist sicher überrascht, in ""L'amico Fritz"" ein Werk zu finden, das weitgehend ohne Dramatik auskommt, sondern vor allem lyrische, ja alltägliche Szenen bringt. Da hat Mascagni sicher einige schöne Melodien geschrieben, aber eine wirklich packende Oper ist nicht daraus geworden. Es ist für mich also verständlich, dass dieses Werk nur selten aufgeführt wird. Um so erfreulicher ist es natürlich, dass sich Sänger mit so kostbaren Stimmen wie Mirella Freni und Luciano Pavarotti dieses Werks angenommen haben. Pavarotti stand zur Zeit dieser Aufnahme freilich noch ganz am Anfang seiner Karriere, aber seine herrliche Stimme und sein Ausdrucksvermögen sind schon voll da. Auch die kleinen Rollen sind gut besetzt."
2,"Good, until it breaks!","My 3 year old had fun with it for a month or two. She took good care of it, but it broke somehow. The sound is all fuzzy and sometimes it has a loud high pitch sound. The other thing I don't like about it is that it goes through so many batteries!"
2,not happy with product.,"This was a great idea and my twin boys love it. My problem is that the books are hard to find. Those I have been able to find are more geared towards older kids meaning those in kindergarten or 1st grade that are learning to read. Secondly, the few books like Thomas and Friends I have been able to find for their age group wear out really fast. The cartridges that come with the book start to malfunction after only being a few months old. I would skip this one and just buy the regular leap pad."
1,Waste of money!,I bought this toy for my daughter for her second birthday a couple years ago. She never had the attention span to sit and play with it until she was about four. By then she had a Leapster and wanted nothing to do with the My First Leap Pad. The toy was not abused but didn't always read the cartridges and constantly turned off for no reason at all. This toy is a waste of your time and money. A better choice is the Leapster. It costs $80 but is worth every cent. So buy a Leapster and let your kids play with the free displays of Leap Pads at the stores.
1,A waste of money,"This LeapPad system is very frustrating. My daughter got this for Christmas and played with it once or twice, and then got disgusted with it, and so did I.The biggest problem I had is that half the pages of the book that came with it don't work correctly. I touch the green go circle and it either starts telling the story on another page, or just makes a funny sound and does nothing. Or, even if it does read the info off the correct page, sometimes if I touch one thing, it will say it's another, like on the page with the parts of the body, I would touch the mouth and it would keep saying nose!I know I'm doing everything correctly because my son has the big LeapPad, which is the same principal. I should have just let my daughter play with his LeapPad and saved some money."
4,"Good Toy, But Doesn't Hold Up to Toddler Use","I bought this toy for my two daughters, aged 2 and 4. After three months of use the unit intermittently wouldn't recognize the cartridges that we would plug into it. The problem got worse over time and now the pen works intermittently as well. My girls were never wild with it, never threw it against a wall or blatantly abused it, just normal toddler use. My First Leappad was fun while it worked, but my advice is to save your money and wait until your kids are old enough for the regular Leappad."
4,very disappointed.,"I like this toy for my grandson, but I am not very happy that you can not find the additional books to go with it. If the point is to buy the next step up, I am going to return it and not buy the next size."
4,"Great Product, LeapFrog has another winner!","My 2 & 1/2 year old LOVES his LeapPad! This has been a wonderful toy! (not to mention educational!)<br />Granted, the alignment is very important, as other reviewers commented, however, the books are sturdy and provide fun and learning in one durable package!<br />Buy this, you won't regret it!<br />"
1,hate it hate it hate it,The only star this item gets is for the fact that my son loves it. He got his first one at three (which was too soon) and know at almost five we are on our THIRD leappad. The problem is that stupid pen. The orange wire connecting it breaks every time. This time it broke inside the orange casing!!! He has had this one for a month and a half and I've been monitoring him closely so this wouldn't happen again but it did. They sell replacement pens for about $6.00 but I think I've just had it at this point. BUY A POWERTOUCH INSTEAD!!!!!
2,broke to quickly,I gave this 2 stars onle because my son did enjoy this toy. But with in 7-8 months it did not even work right. Would turn it self off when playing with it and the pointer would not register whenever you touched it to the picture books. Someone else that I know had the same exact problem. I would have to say this needs to be alittle more sturdy if it is a young childs toy
4,Fun But Not Durable,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 2 1/2 years old. She loved it and we only allowed her to play with it when we were sitting with her. We were actively involved in teaching her how to use it. By the time she got the hang of it, just a few months later, it started not reading the cartridges. We would save money to buy additional books and by the time we had 3 the LeapPad was erroring out when reading from the cartridge.Sometimes we can get it to work by blowing on the cartridge and the contact spot on the LeapPad and sometimes we end up wedgeing a paper in the hole with the cartridge. It seems to be the only way to get it to work.In my opinion a product of this price should last longer than four months. I was sincerely disapointed to see no help on the website for how to fix this problem. Their warranty is only 3 months for this expensive kids toys.My daughter has since learned to use the computer and it has served us much better than the LeapPad ever has."
4,Best for Age 3,"I was not sure whether to get the regular Leap Pad or My First Leap Pad for my 3 year old. I was getting the regular Leap Pad for my 5 year old. If I got the My First Leap Pad, they would not be able to exchange books. After getting the My First Leap Pad for my 3 year old and sitting with him while playing it, I am really glad that I choose this one and not the regular Leap Pad. This one is the right choice for a 3 year old. In my opinion the regular Leap Pad is a little too advanced for a 3 year old. My 3 year old loves this and will sit for quite some time playing with it. I just hope they come out with more books soon. I highly recommend this for a 3 year old."
2,Won't grow with your child!,"First, I must say that I love LeapFrog products! But don't waste your money on the My First LeapPad. It is not compatible with anything! Buy the origianl LeapPad then you can purchase books as your child learns. I bought the My First LeapPad and when my daughter was ready for more challenging books I had to go out and buy a LeapPad... now I can get books thru 6th grade (thanks to the new Quantum line!)"
5,love this ring,"I love this cobra ring! It fits perfectly. It's not heavy nor big, where it can be distracting. It's just a really simple ring with a personality.One small negative thing about it is that the cobra face can get in the way with pockets. When you reach in your pockets for some change or keys, the ring sticks outside of the pockets. So, you have to ""dig into"" yourself and then down to your pockets.Otherwise, I still love this ring!"
3,Itchy,Itchy bra. The minimizing does work and the itchiness did go away after a few washes. It's okay.
4,Realistic instruction...charming instructor...annoying music,"Really like this video's approach for active seniors. Just challenging and paced quickly enough to sustain interest after repeated viewings. It's one of several DVDs we use for resident led morning exercise sessions at our senior apartment building. Strong points: Vivien's cheerful attitude, pace of exercises and transitions. Nice to see people at different participation levels. Weak: After a few repetitions the background music becomes kind of irritating. Certainly not a unique problem. My solution: mute the DVD sound and use a separate CD player to vary musical selections. Even most seniors can remember the instructions after a couple of times."
3,Average,"I absolutely loved the premise of this book.Unfortunately, the reading it part was not so great. While this book is not horrible, it felt incredibly disjointed to me and really, I did not see the point of writing the thing, unless the author needed to ""unwind"" somehow.I could not connect with the author or any of her friends and I kept wondering why she decided to have children? I mean, she could have just continued with her ""old"" life -just did not get the point of this whole book. By the way, it wasn't even funny...."
2,Cybertrash,"This book is a wonderful example of everything that is wrong with contemporary cultural theory when applied to new technologies. As in his other writings about the Internet and multimedia, Kroker attempts to speak with the accent of the genuine hacker, but his prose betrays a serious ignorance of the subject matter involved."
2,Bad software support,"1stuninstalled old iTouch, Reinstalled new iTouch without rebooting, resulting in crash and format. This was probably a result of not restarting the computer after the uninstallation. After win 2000 install it started to work again.2ndkeyboard would be recognized in the beginning (hitting del for bios setup) but not recognized when win2000 was booting up (couldn't enter safe mode)3rdWhen I tried to plug my regular keyboard back in it would work until win2000 booted up and itouch software came online. Neither my ps2(old non - logitech) mouse or keyboard would work then. I finally got it to work again by using a USB Mouse.I had no support numbers that came with the product. AFter laying down money I expect so freakin support. I went online and I to struggle through some stupid automated preprogrammed repsonse questionnaire to my problems. After avoiding all the newbie questions it finally went to email a human being."
5,Just too good,"I have received the product today and am very satisfied with the quality, looks and performance of the product. Both mouse and keyboard functions very well from a distance of 7-8 feets. The short cut keys provided are very useful and the multimedia keys are just too good. Its really worth the price."
3,keyboard good ... mouse bad,This combo was pretty good. Though the mouse constantly needs charging. The battery lost charge over time. The keyboard worked excellently.
2,The software is sorry,"I love the keyboard and mouse but the mouse software is driving me nuts. It hangs, it jumps, it scolls on its own. I am a professional who uses the computer all day long. I would like to toss the mouse in the river and just let it drown. The software is bad and is more like a popup virus. After many hours of studying to get rid of the stupid popup screens, now the mouse is nothing but an irritate. It will be gone from my desk very very soon. Too bad because I like everything else about it. Shame on Logitech for such a sorry job."
5,The ewe gets it all in the end,There was an old geezer named SamIn the habit of using his palmHis room-mate got miffedAnd gave him a giftOf this handy inflatable lambThough white was the number one choiceSam found himself raising his voiceWhen the Asian recorderWrote down the wrong orderAnd shipped him the sheep in turquoiseNow he's started a nursing home trendwith his colorful personal friendHe changed up his willafter paying his billso the ewe gets it all in the end
4,It should either be more...or *less* realistic....,"Flaws: 1) this looks nothing like the Sheep (uncredited) that co-starred with Woody Allen in ""Everything you wanted to know about Sex But were afraid to ask.""2) No hidden pockets to stash amyl nitrate.3) Given the rather, uh....specialized nature of this product's appeal honest reviews will be hard to come buy. Thos who explore its full utility in all dimensions are likely to remain anonymous.Pros: 1) nothing like this for a bachelor party for a guy who is basically marrying as a beard! Throw this one and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""The Wedding Banquet' and a couple of other wink-wink for the bachelor party pajama night.2) looks just like its picture.3) is funny for about two minutes, then when everyone is drunk latter it is funny again...but then the next morning usually someone has to check in to rehab and therapy and you are a groomsman short."
2,I wish I'd read the reviews before I got it.,"I didn't know this was a plastic sheep pool toy.It's not. It's something to go to bed with on those lonely nights. Just make sure to heat it up and use plenty of lube on it. If you don't, then you should expect rashes to appear."
5,Incredible service and incredible artist Kent Bottenfield...,"I bought the CD... Take me Back by Kent Bottenfield and was very pleased with delivery of this CD as well as the artist...Kent Bottenfield, I like the entire CD and HIGHLY recommend it!! You won't be disappointed!!!"
5,Excellent Versatility!,"Principato's latest release is a real gem on which he demonstrates a substantial amount of versatility moving from Jazz to Blues to Flamengo to Rock. All of the songs are of on an even, moderately paced tempo, making the stylistic changes subtle.The opening number is the beautiful flamenoesque sounding piece ""One Night in Hindustan"". Principato then pays tribute to Carlos Santana on ""Santana Claus"" and ""Mi Solea"", shifting briefly to soft Rock on two numbers ""67/68"" and Wars ""Slippin into Darkness"". There are also three smooth Jazz flavored numbers, ""Dark is the Night"", ""Fallen Angels"" and ""Another Place, Another Time"". Finally, Principato plays ""Until We Meet Again"" which uses chords from, and is essentially a plug for, his new guitar book, ""Open String Guitar"".This is an enjoyable CD for a quite evening or when entertaining. 5 Stars all the way."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,I stumbled upon Tom Principato on Pandora one day and man.... I am hooked! He is amongst the greatest blues guitarists in my book. Santa Clause is the song I always put on if I want to get into a dancin good mood :). The rest of the songs are mellow enough to play in the bedroom.
2,Not great,"I have been searching for a pair of long quality leggings for some time now. I have a pair of Hue jeggings size L that are great but a little short. Unless its summer or I wear them with boots they do not look right. I am 5""10 and weigh 152 lbs. This pair are a little shorter then I would like; also I bought an XL hoping the length would be better. While they are longer than the size L the fit is a little baggy."
5,the only heavier weight legging I could find that FITS,"I wear a 10/12 (usually talls) and the medium is perfect, the waist is up where it should be, the elastic has grip, and the fabric is thick enough for modesty. FINALLYThey are barely long enough on my long legs, but at least they are not short. No massive shrinkage, just a decent legging to wear with a tunic. Happy with the purchase, will look for more colors. The black is nice and true and didn't bleed on first wash with other darks."
1,Not fun,I was so excited to buy this game as I'm a huge fan of the TV show. I played it with a large group of people at my house and after just 15-20 minutes they were asking if I had any other games available to play because they were bored!Too bad...I really wanted to like this game.
4,A Game for Friendaholics!,"Is a fun game, realy designed for frinds fans and some times very difficult. Good to enjoy with friends."
2,I wish I'd read the Amazon reviews more carefully,"I wish I'd read the Amazon reviews more carefully before buying this, particularly ""A terrible abridgement"". This recording may have sonic and vocal performance virtues, but the third act in particular has been hacked to incomprehensibility. Lehár is pretty fluffy stuff to begin with, but it's not as utterly scatterbrained as one would be led to conclude from this recording."
2,A terrible abridgement,"Franz Lehar must be rolling over in his grave over this one! Go ahead and tear your hair out, they have abridged this masterpiece. Had I known that, I would never have laid down cash for this atrocity. The Decca version of ""Die Lustige Witwe"" remains the standard by which others will be judged. Not only is this disc abridged, the musical quality is not particularly good. There seems to be a problem in the mixing, where some portions seems overly loud, and other sections seems tinny and distant. Abridging a work like this is sort of like culling bits out of ""Hamlet."" It just isn't done, but some lunatic attempted this hatchet job. Do yourself a favor and avoid this. Stick with the Decca version."
3,AC/DC Interview,Ac/dc is an awesome band the way there history goes like when Bon Scott died they thought they were done then Brain Johnson came along and brought them back together they are just plain out awesome Angus Young probaly the best gutairist around and is 45 and moves around like he is twenty agian I want to know how he does it.AC/DC has made a lot of albums apromixtly 20 including bonfire and live 2 special edition they just are the best i guess i hope they keep going as strong as they started but they gonnahave to end some time this album is not the best but still is pretty cool so if you ever want to purchase it go ahead and remember AC/DC rules and don't you dare say you don't have the money because it is ac/dc not backstreet boys!
5,Beautiful,"Such bright, crisp colors. Very quality paper. Arrived wonderfully packaged & right on time. This is my boyfriend's favorite Kurosawa film, & this is going to make a beautiful addition to our home!"
4,Very different from the movie,"This is one of those rare books that I actually preferred the movie over the book. Some of the basic scenarios were the same; however many of the relationships in the book, such as with Daniel and George were very different. I did like this book and her writing, just the story line in the movie was much more to my taste. Her relationship with Mossie seemed more rushed in the book while it embellished far more on the other two men. I get that she was learning about herself and how she handled relationships, but it missed the true romance. And ladies, it didn't hurt that a young Colin Farrell played Daniel, as well as fine actors who played Elizabeth and Mossie. This said, the book should still be recommended reading."
5,The BEST!!,This is the BEST barn in the whole world!! I LOVE to play with it!! It may be $$$ but it is worth it!! It is so(...) much fun to play with!!
2,250mg per tablet,"The research regarding Aminogen and increased amino acid uptake concludes that for a whey protein concentrate of 50 grams, 2.5 grams and or 5 grams of Aminogen is required for the desired effect. The dose per tablet is 250 mg so you would need 10 tablets per protein shake. Not very cost effective."
5,exactly what I wanted,Easy to use and able to angle it in any direction easily. Used it on vent under my Christmas tree to deflect warm air.
3,unstuck,the concept is great the performance is sub-par. these vents will only stay in place if the vent opening is free of paint. these deflectors will not stay in place with small kids around the house. these deflectors need stronger magnets which will dramaticlly improve their performance. save your money and find a better dealer.
2,Functional but flimsy,"If you have pets, these are probably not for you. Any weight on top is going to break the cheap, thin, and flimsy plastic they are made out of. They work great when they are not broken, though."
1,HEAT DEFLECTORS FOR HOME VENTS,THESE DEFLECTORS FALL OFF THE VENT THEY DO NOT STAY ONCE YOU PLACE THEM THERE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT WILL KEEP THESE DEFECTORS IN PLACE AND COVER THE VENT AS SPECIFIED?
4,heat savers,Bought these to direct air from ceiling vents towards middle of the room instead of at cold windows. They work very well.
2,Works,This is really shoddy quality. We put it on the ceiling so it won't get abused but I would look for something else if its going to get much use at all.
4,THE VENGA BOYS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS CD IS GREAT BUT THERE OTHER SOUNDS THAT I JUST DON'T LIKE BUT THE THERE LIKE 8 SONGS I LIKE AND THERE COOL BUT I DON'T LIKE THE GROUP NAME ""VENGA BOYS"" WHY VENGA BOYS? THE GIRLS ARE THE ONES THAT SING THE SONG JUST CHANGE THE GROUP NAME BUT THE CD GOOD BUY IT!"
2,OK at First Listen...Dull Afterwards,"The reason I bought this CD was because we were doing a routine to the song ""We Like To Party"" and I thought it a really fun, catchy song. I then heard, ""Boom Boom Boom"" and liked that too, so I decided to definatly buy the CD. BIG MISTAKE. All this CD is is disco-like stupid dance tunes that don't really say anything besides ""it's fun for us to party"". Even those two tracks I DID like got so dull after listening to them about three times. I guess if your into the mechanical dance music and weird party sounds, you might enjoy it if your actually having a party or just feel like dancing around the room. But I'd suggest to anyone else to skip this CD and save your money. If you want dance tunes, try some pop music instead."
3,This is an ok album.,"I think the Vengaboys' album is ok. This album isn't the best I've heard from bands like these, such as Aqua. I hope that they will become a bigger pop group than they are now. I think they should try alittle less bubble gum."
4,It's a great C.D.!!!!,"I really have not heard the whole album. What i heard was GREAT! It has a really addictive beat. The best song is ""BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM""!!!! I can't get enough of it."
2,"Expect less, get what you want;-)","To put it short, the two DJs who do all the beats don't even get credit. The two guys in the band sing in probably 3 songs at most for maybe one verse. the Vengaboys NEVER respond to any fans at their website. Etc. etc. The DJs are pretty tight but they have the rest of the group singing. If you want something better, get the Fatboy Slim CD."
1,Mindless muzak.,"This type of mindless rubbish gets music a bad name. Sounds like some marketing gurus got together and came up with the lowest common denominator to sell to the masses. Music for 3 year olds maybe, but hardly adult fare. I would leave a party if this was all that was on offer!"
4,A mix of Aqua and throw in some Euro,"I got a friend to buy this cd, thinking it would be commercialized dance aimed at teeny boppers. I was incredibly supprised to find some amazingly euro beats mixed with some HiNRG. It's not a serious album (the likes of faithless or other euro), but its got its own kind of pop/euro. If you like Boom Boom Boom then you will like the album. My more mainstream friends were even impressed. Song 9 (I think) is my sleeper pick. If you dont expect much, you will be thrilled.-jer"
2,"Euro house at its worst, good for teens/kiddies.","This commercial, synthetic group are awful. This music is, aside from the decent Up and Down, in a word... ANNOYING! Much to my irritation they've been banging away on commercial radio on this country for months. Worst of the bunch goes to the smug, slow We're going to Ibiza. There have been many cool European dance acts in recent times (Cassius, Etienne de Crecy, Daft Punk + Stardust et al) but this is woeful. Your money is better off spent on an act which has talent to go with any stilted dance routines."
5,GREAT CD ! FIRT TIME I HEARD IT WAS IN ACAPILCO !,"I HAD TO GET IT , I DON'T REMMEMBER IF I BOUGHT IT HERE OR THERE,BUT ANYHOW I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT ! MY FAVORITE SONG IS ""BOOM, BOOM "" NOT THE VENGA BUS AS YOU WOULD THINK . THEY HAVE IT ON A SIX FLAGS, GREAT AMERICA COMMERCIAL ANYWAYS SO I GOT TIRED OF IT, THE OTHER SONG I LIKE IS ""WERE GOING TO IBIZA "" THAT ABOUT SUMS IT IT , HOPE YOU GET IT AND ENJOY IT ! I ALTHOUGH I RECOMMEND YOU GET IT DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON SHOPPING CART,NOT FROM A "" SEE ALL SELLERS CART "" AS IT MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE ! COUPLE OF WEEKS MAYBE !"
5,Sounds Great,"The Taters continue their successful sound of Voxbox by using the influence of greats like Roy Orbison and Buddy Holly and combining it with their own sound. And there are very few who can pull off anything close to Orbison's singing, but it works here, That is probably because it used as a major influence and not an attempt to imitate. The songs are good with about 5 songs being exceptional and that justifies the 5 star rating. If you liked Voxbox, this one is very similar."
2,Didn't work with my Toshiba laptop,"It arrived promptly, I installed it. However it only scans for networks and will not connect to any network. I hope it's a software issue only."
2,Mismatched sizes,"Got 2 of these mitts - the material and quality of workmanship looks decent, but one mitt is a little smaller across the palm than the other. My hands are smallish for a guy but even so the one mitt feels tight. It seems like a defect rather than an incorrect size. Won't bother returning it though, since I hardly ever use mitts to begin with!"
4,Good jazz soundtrack.,"Space Cowboys was a pretty good movie. The only time it got annoying was when they started playing that stupid N Sync song! God--can't we go to the movies these days WITHOUT having to listen to N Sync? Thank God they did NOT put N Sync on this soundtrack...it nearly would've killed it. This soundtrack is good, and I recommend it if you like jazz music or really loved the movie."
3,Good But - WHERE did they hide the title cut?,"I have seen the movie AND listened to the Soundtrack Album and I have to admit to being disappointed - back in MY day, if the album said Soundtrack - they INCLUDED the title cut! I know there is one - I heard it (before I saw the movie) - and it IS in the movie - when they are first entering the NASA Building together if I remember right. I actually bought this Album because I thought that cut would be on it - but it isn't!!!"
3,easily dents - not thick enough on cross section,"I was able to get the job done using this duct, but i really had to be careful so that I did not collapse the duct inward when installing it. I needed this as a transition between a fixed piece of rigid duct, and a removable fan. I was working in a very tight space and end up throwing out the first piece that crumpled up when I tried to move it into place. Work carefully and gently and this will probably work for you. It is very thin when extended, and prone to damage from impact or obstructions."
5,It's a great book and very exciting!,"I liked this book because everytime you turn around something exciting happens! The characters are fit for the book.I liked the main character, Darcy, because in the end she is very brave. This book has exciting, mischievious characters. The baby-sitter,Darcy Stevens, gets interviewed at this ""high-quality"" house. She gets the job and finds out that the children are pests! The second day as she was finishing making lunch ,when all of the sudden the burgular alarm went off!The police come and search, but there's no one around. The police leave and a few minutes later... If you want to know what happens you'll have to read on!So hurry up! It's to exciting to wait!"
5,Must read for anyone with aging parents,"Great resource. Read it before you NEED it. But let's say you're like me, you've waited too long and you're up against a wall, it's still helpful. Get tips on the fine legal issues, get support and guidelines for decision making."
3,NOT X-LARGE,"On the advice of a fellow wood-carver, I purchased these gloves to protect my hands. The gloves are very well made. However, I have a large hand. That being said, I ordered a pair of extra-large gloves. The gloves arrived on time and in good order. However, they are not extra-large as advertised. I had to force them on to my hand. I would send them back, but the return shipping is half the cost of the gloves. Again, they are a quality pair of gloves, but the sizing does not match the size quoted. Wearing an undersized glove while wood carving will cause hand fatigue and cramping in a short period of time. Just be aware when ordering these gloves that they run SMALLER than the advertised size."
3,"Cheap elegant solution, but magnets too weak and screw holes a little fragile.","The Model 51 air deflector is a good design somewhat poorly implemented. The idea is that the deflector mounts on the register and directs the air up (like from behind a piece of furniture). To account for different widths the deflector can adjust from 10"" to 16"" by sliding. It works fine - but the problem is mounting it. The 51 comes with both magnets and screw hole slots. The magnets are too weak to hold it in place. The screw hole slots work provided your register has screws with heads the right size (or you'll need a washer) and enough play to back out the width of the plastic. Then you'll need to be careful to not tighten too much. The clear plastic is fragile and cracks easily."
3,CAREFUL!,"This is NOT for vents with an OPEN-CLOSE lever.The description and the HALF picture shown are NO HELP.Otherwise, the product looks fine--about what you'd expect for the price. The magnet connects nicely to HALF of my vent. Just have to figure out to make it connect to the other half."
4,I don't know what the complaints are about,"I don't know what problems other people had, our vent covers work fine. We unpacked them, stuck them on the vents, and they haven't fallen off. Our vents are on the walls and we've only used them with the air conditioning. Don't know how they will work with the heat on. They hold on to the vents, completely block the airflow, and that's what they are supposed to do. We were able to improve the air temperature distribution in the house."
1,Does not stick to ceiling vent,"I bought this cover up the ceiling vent, but it wasn't strong enough to stay up at all. Not recommended."
1,flimsy,The covers will not stick to the ceiling. they do not completely cover my vent covers. I used neodymium magnets as suggested by one of the reviewers to make them stick to the ceiling vents.
1,Isn't strong enough to do what it is advertised to do,"I should have listened to all of the other reviewers. The magnets are not strong enough to hold these to a register. Your only hope is if the vent is on the floor and the air flow is blocked off some other way first. Even when the vent is closed, the small amount of air coming past is still enough to lift these off of the register..After discovering this, I thought that I would use these for another purpose. I cut them into strips and made magnetic labels for some metal shelving at work. However, the same problem persisted. They would only stick to the shelf as long as no one walked past them and brushed them with their sleeve.I don't think there is any possible use for these. Sorry."
2,Weak Magnet,"I bought these to cover a ceiling mounted vent in an unused room. The magnet is not strong enough to hold the cover 'up'. It seems like it will work fine on floor vents, but this did not work for me on my ceiling vent."
2,Does not hold,"I saw the poor reviews of this, but the price seemed good enough to take a swing at for a vent on the floor I needed to block. One of my vents blows extra hard in a space I have no use for so I wanted to block it with these vent covers. A single one of these covers could not stay on the vent, even with gravity assisting it. I ended up using all 3 on the same vent to use the weight to hold it down. The magnetic hold is very weak, I can't imagine these working on a ceiling vent at all."
3,If you buy plan on purchasing extra magnets becasue these are weak.,I bought these but after reading reviews had a back up plan. I also ordered neodymium magnets which can be found on amazon. I needed to use these so that the cover would stay attached.
5,Excellent toy,"My 13 month old has been using this for over 6 months and LOVES it. He could play with it for hours, and I think he's going to like it even more later on. Great toy, great product."
2,Lost in translation,"I personally love this toy, but my 6 mo old... well, she just looks at it, spins the wheels, and that's it. Maybe she's not that stage to actually touch the letters yet. After about 4-5 spins, she loses interest.However, ultimately, I believe that she'll learn to love it. And I may try to detach the ball from its cradle to see if it make a difference. But she's not walking yet either, so it's hard to tell how durable it is if she doesn't drop it.The ""ABCDEFG..."" song becomes very repetitive if she doesn't spin it continuously- it starts over from the beginning otherwise... annoying for adults! Why didn't the egineers make it continue from there on??!One nice feature is that every letter has a different, albeit short, song that it plays in the music setting. It doesn't become old like many toys."
5,"Fun for toddlers, and educational, too!","Both of my children love this toy. My daughter received this for her first birthday, and could sing parts of the alphabet by two months later. The lights are very attractive to children and the music makes them dance. It is a very longlasting and durable toy. The only problem we have ever had was with the weight of the ball being too heavy for smaller children if they drop it on their toes. Other than that, it is a great, well-made toy."
4,Batteries impossible to change,"Yes, just about everything I've read on all 100 something reviews is true, good & bad. This toy was fun for our daughter from when she received it at 10mos till over age 2 1/2.BUT BEWARE THE BATTERY CHANGE! I recommend before buying this at the store, make the store-worker show you how to change the battery so you don't have to worry about breaking the toy or losing your money. I've been working on opening up the toy for the last 40 minutes and am now jamming a screwdriver in it to pry it apart, probably damaging it. Other's have commented on this, too, if you read all the reviews. The great thing is it comes with long-lasting batteries so your kid gets to enjoy it for a long time (thus,all the rave reviews come in). My daughter would love to sing the songs on this ball if we could just get new batteries in it."
2,Boring Toy,I bought this toy for my son when he was a year old. It would sustain his attention for a few minutes and that was it. The voice is annoying and the ball was boring both on the base and off. It ended up in the basement less than a year later.
3,"OK, But won't get much use","I bought this for my daughter when she was six months old and though while the ball was on the base she could make it spin and play music, she never really found this toy entertaining. When any of the letters on the center on this ball are pressed (the letters are small and have to be pressed hard to work)it either says the letter or plays a song. However, if the ball is moved/rolled during the song it then reverts back to one of two standard songs it plays whenever the ball is in motion. This gets very old very fast. At a year of age my daughter never plays with this ball any more. There are any number of toys out there that teach letters in a more entertaining way than this ball and for the price, one would be better suited getting those instead."
3,My kids never played with it,"My son received this toy for his 1st Xmas, when he was about 6 mos. old. None of my kids ever used it as anything except a weapon to throw @ each other. It is very heavy. It comes off the base & they would use it as a ball, but you can find better, cheaper & less dangerous balls than this. As far as education, it will repeat the alphabet while it spins but it stops when the ball stops spinning so I don't think it has much value there, either."
1,We wish we wouldn't have wasted our money.,"We purchased this toy to entertain our 9 mo. old. She was less than entertained. The letters have to be pushed Hard, by an adult. The letters are too small. The music is annoying and will not stay playing a whole song unless locked or held very still. Also, the womens voice says OH when the A is pushed,"
3,"Better than Plantronics, but still not great","I had a Plantronics DSP-500 headset that quit working the same day I received it. So I bought this Logitech and have had more reliable service from it, and the audio quality seems comparable to the Plantronics. I'm happy with this unit because it didn't break on day one and still seems to be going strong. I do wish there was something more professional available but it seems that most computer headsets aren't that great yet.I use this for Skype conversations and don't really have any complaints with the audio quality. It's still better than a telephone."
1,Bad value,"This headset really disappointed me. For the first four to five weeks I owned this headset, it suited my needs. However, it soon began to fail; it refused to play back any audio and it recorded unacceptable amounts of static. Despite these problems, it is incredibly expensive for the quality it promises. Logitech has completely ruined this headset."
2,microphone broke down after four months,"Because I suffer from a repetitive stress injury, I am dependent on voice recognition software (and thus, a decent microphone) just to get by using the computer.I was very disappointed with this product. Although the volume and mute futures worked well (better than a previous Plantronics product), after about four months of daily use, the microphone simply stopped functioning. Before that, the recognition was pretty great.The headphone sound seemed pretty good, I used them to listen to CDs all time. Never had any problems with the sound cutting out.Perhaps Logitech needs to work out its quality control little bit better. I would buy the product again if I knew that it would last."
3,Fun but Confusing for My Son,"I would recommend this product but make sure you have a child at least 8+. It is not like the normal sorry so my kids got confused by a lot of the cards because they have different options. If your child could understand the different options, then I would definitely recommend it for you."
4,Flash Gordon of the 21st century,"While this series was on I enjoyed the wildly Alien species from puppets to strange blue make up and rubber masks.The acting is B movie with a British accent and the sets are well donebut you know the shots are studio.This series is sort of Flash Gordon up dated with imagination?The end of ""Family Ties"" is a classic serial ""cliff hanger""."
5,Comprehensive and to the point,"Marty Hall's coreservlets book is quite simply the clearest and best value for money computing book I have ever purchased. The writing is comprehensive with no ""padding"", giving you all the information you need in a logical and straight forward manner. If you need to know about servlets and JSP, and how to make them work together BUY IT."
3,Could Be Better,This book needs a better index and clear API listings like the Core Java books. I often need a very specific piece of information and can't find it in this book.
4,"Masterpiece, but fast becoming a dinosaur..","This book is a joy to read. The concepts are very nicely introduced and stays within your grip.However, JSP is growing faster than a speeding train, and the book is now collecting dust on my shelf since the topics are barely germane to the new versions of specs supported by Tomcat being put out there. It is time to upgrade this beautiful masterpiece of a book on this topic."
4,great book!,"This is an excellent book. Easy to read and understood, the explaination is just right, not too long or too short. The examples are also excellent. It is almost a perfect book, except that I found 3 incomplete sets of examples:1. Chapter 9, ""Shopping cart"", when you click on the ""Proceed to Checkout"", nothing happened.2. chapter 12, ""ShadowedTextApplet"", when I clicked on the button ""Open Frame"", nothing happened.3. chapter 15, ""On line Travel Agent"", is an incomplete set, missing some key files."
1,Bad book,"This book is not easy to follow if you don't know HTML and some HTTP. For example the books describes how a Servlet processes a GET method, but did not tell me all HTTP browsers send a GET or POST message.The book looks like a guy with plenty of knowledge threw a book together, i.e., Chapter 18 covers databases and is about 18 pages of prose and 38 pages of screen shots and code listing.If you're new to Java Server Pages try JavaServer Pages by Whitehead. Whiteheads book is half code examples, but very short examples that teach by showing. This books is NOT perfect, but it will get you started quickly with JSP, and it's easy to follow."
1,this books gives me irritation,Please do not buy this book. I am a Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 platform and I could not read this book. There is no depth in the subject matters covered. It gives me irritation. The explanation is not at all interesting and it is explained as though it is for 1st graders. 99.9% of the sample programs are useless in real world projects. I have ordered the Instant Javaserver pages book from Mcgraw Hill. I don't know how it will be. I am expecting the JavaServer Pages book from Oreilly would be interesting.
2,not for the beginner,"i try this becuase the core series always not bad such as core java2 vol1,2 which are good for me to starting java.And later i moved on jsp and then purchased this book. However i don't get anything helpful from this (as a beginner).If you are beginner, i will recommand oreilly-""javasever pages""which brings more clearly concenpt"
5,Extremely Good Book,"I think this book is one of the greatest books to learn servlets and javaServer pages. Besides being organized well, it's very detailed and simple at the same time."
3,Perhaps some more dynamic data,"This book is good for beginners but really lacks examples on dealing with dynamic data, servlets and jsp. It would have been even more helpful if some of the examples such as the ShoppingCart and Online Travel did not hard cord the data, but instead used a database connection to retrieve data."
1,"Poor design, poor quality","Plastic is flimsy and poorly molded, and contents of box have less of a deflection ""cup"" than what is shown in the photo here or on the box cover. Magnets only work by ""pinching"" the two sides of the duct together around a duct that protrudes,and will not attach to the face of a metal duct."
1,Did not work for me,My registers are on the wall not on the floor. They continually fell off. Did not stick very well at all. I was disappointed.
2,suggestions,"need bigger and different size and shape, some older houses like mine, have bigger wider vents"
2,"Not Disappointed, Not Impressed","I was a little disappointed with this product. We have our vents in the ceiling and it doesn't have enough magnetic strength to hold itself up there. However, for the price I paid that's what I should have expected.If your vents are on the ground, I bet they would work spectacularly."
4,remastering helps!,"A great lp set that was poorly remastered for its initial CD release -- somewhere the low end got lost, leaving the cello solo to sound like a viola solo, and the bass soloists to sound somewhat baritone-ish. EMI has fixed that problem for sure. (This recording is now very subwoofer-friendly, though I'll leave others to decide if that's too much of a good thing.) They've also re-tracked the discs, so disc 1 no longer ends in the middle of the scene -- also a major plus. Though true fans of analog needn't discard their lps yet, even for those who already own the old CD version it's worth considering picking up the new one."
1,Beware !!!!!,"This CD is TG Sheppard's RE-RECORDING of his earlier hits. These are not the original songs from the 70's-80's They have been redone. You would be better off getting one of his CD's with the ""Original"" songs he had hits with."
4,Cat Lube Hairball Aid,"So far, so good. Seems to be working, so I will be purchasing another bottle! I spoke to the Vet about it and she agreed that it can do no harm."
2,Inconsistent Often BAD product quality,"The product is a medium sized round ""pill"" [think dime size but thick] you are told to break up by hand and sprinkle chunks on the cat's food. Problem: hard as a rock more often than not. This varies by batch and within batches. You can with a hammer bust up these ""pills"" but your cat needs jaws like a jack-hammer to chew them so you throw out most of the batch. Apparently they changed vendors to produce these pills and whoever they are now using has the formula wrong or the pressure wrong but you end up throwing out half the batch. They will refund your money if you have a receipt. I do admit that the product does seem to help the cat pass hair instead of upchucking it. BUT these folks can't get the product right with whatever vendor they are now using to make it."
2,"digestive aid, difficult to feed to kitty",Hard to give to cats. Need mortar and pestle to crush tabs and put in cat food. Not easy to break by hand and just give to cats. Rejected by cats.
4,a moderate cure for hairballs...not perfect,"Our little guy ADORES these tablets, he acts like they're treats! He's got tons of long soft fur, and we get to see his disgustingly huge hairballs ALL THE TIME. These tablets were great at first because, unlike the liquid tube stuff we'd tried, it actually seemed to work, and it was much easier to give him. Since starting these, though, we've leveled out. We have far fewer hairballs than before, but he no longer has no hairballs, which was the beautiful result we had for about a month or two. He throws up a hairball about once every two weeks now, and the hairballs are noticeably smaller, so small it makes me furious he bothers throwing them up! Before these, he would throw up huge hairballs at least once a week.So, it's definitely better than before, and he loves these so much, but I can't help but wish we could find something that would removed the problem entirely, like these initially did!"
1,Pure Dead,"Without doubt not up to any standards. The writing is sloppy. Poor or absent logic. I can not really recommend it.Graphic violence for violence's sake and not as part of the story. Who cares if a spider is enjoying herself sucking out fly juice? Even Stephen King makes sure that his writing is just in the realm of reality; that is what makes it scary.In ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" the characters are likeable or at least better fleshed out. They do not just rattle around for the sake of adding more pages to the book.Do not assume the Lemony Snicket fans would enjoy this either as the story has no redeeming value. The biggest faux pas of all is assuming that the reader is so computer illiterate they would not notice the technology is lacking and the author is only using buzzwords.I could go on and on about what makes for an interesting tale, however you get the idea that this series does not contain the ""magic."" It is ""Pure Dead"""
5,Delightful!,"I am so glad to have ""discovered"" Pure Dead Magic and it's sequel, Pure Dead Wicked by Deb Gliori. I have been recommending them to everyone who will listen! A delightful combination of the elements of the Harry Potter books, the Lemony Snicket books and the Artemis Fowl books. Great for both children and adults who love a good fantasy story that is a bit on the irreverent side."
3,Harry Potter meets Lemony Snicket in a high tech setting...,"Not!Someone's just trying to trade on known entities. This book is okay, but the comparison to Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket's writings only does harm. I came away disappointed because my expectations had not been met.Now, if they had just mentioned that it's a nifty little book....The Addams Family meets Mary Poppins is a misnomer of the worst kind. Worthwhile idea, but poor construction doesn't give it the edge it really needs. It will remain a cute, but little-taken-out library book for the rest of it's existence."
2,Everything Except a Life,"This is a nice book that's written in such a dry style that it's difficult to finish the book. So you might rush through the pages when you are stuck somewhere but if you thought they could have written it in a more human style, then you are spot on what this book is!Anyway, I use PowerPoint 2003 but this book has a nice coverage of color schemes but nothing like Cutting Edge PowerPoint for Dummies. That book covers PowerPoint 2000, 2002, and 2003."
2,Strange and waayyyy too lonnngggg....,"The only word to describe this movie is strange. Also, it drags in so many places that you want to fast-forward to the end which is completely anti-climactic and extremely far-fetched.The one and only bright spot in this film is the performance by the villain. He is wonderful in his part, and you get the idea that his talents are being wasted by making this turkey. At times, his acting talents are amazing. The others in the film are mediocre at best. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours."
1,very disappointed,I bought my grandsons the light and sound fire engine and ambulance from Brio. Neither one had a light or made any noise!!! I didn't bring batteries along as they were supposed to be in the toys. They were a big flop. This is NOT what I expected from Brio.
5,Great stuff and in a great organized container,"This was a perfect compliment to my existing tool kits. I can fill in the blanks on any parts that break from other kits, and it comes in a great package. Thanks for the Denali!!!"
3,cheap tool,"it mailed fast,i got the tools only three days.but the quality is not so good!i found two of them already broken when i opened the box."
4,Muy Bueno,"Esta muy buena la caja con todos los accesorios , lo unico algunas puntas me vinieron oxidadas, seria lo unico para objetar."
1,Serves me right for not reading reviews first!,"Anyone who is starting a handyman business and doesn't already know the elementary information provided in this book is NOT smart enough to own and operate their own business.There is a much better book out there geared towards contractors, but the information is much more useful. This book is a waste of money."
5,Harris and Me - For Adults and Kids Alike,"I read this book as part of a teaching literacy course I took last semester in college, and have to say that of all the books I've ever read, this is truly a favorite. Seeing as how elementary education is my major, I've read countless books for students grades K-12, but ""Harris and Me"", is by far the best. It's a story told from the perspective of the boy nobobdy wants, sent to live with distant relatives on their farm. Upon meeting Harris, ""Me"" as the narrator is known, is engaged,(often against his will), in a series of adventures and mishaps. Written with a personal touch that is rare, this book will make you laugh aloud, and touch your heart to the point of tears. It is truly excellent. While this book would be suitable for students grades 6+, I reccommend it to any nostalgic adult who is looking for a wonderful read."
4,dan,"Harris and Me is a true story written by Gary Paulsen. It is about a boy who has parents who drink a lot, so they send him to stay with various relatives most of the time. This book is about the time when he goes and stays at his aunt and uncles farm and meets his cousin Harris. His life will change forever.Gary Paulsen writes a lot of books about big adventures, this book is a little different. It is about the little adventures of everyday farm life. It keeps you wanting to read more. Harris is his cousin and has a lot of fun games like Nazi pigs (with real pigs) and being Tarzan by swinging off of the second floor of the barn. The narrator has never experienced anything like this before.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for humor or adventure, or to anybody who likes to read a good book. I think this is one of Gary Paulsen's best.I would give this book four out of five stars."
4,Harris and Me,"In the book, HARRIS AND ME, by Gary Paulson, there are some parts that will keep you on the edge of your seat and some parts that will almost make you fall asleep. An example of a part that kept me on the edge of my seat was when Harris peed on the elctric fence and the shock went through him. I thought that part was funny. A part that I almost fell asleep on was the first chapter. I thought that part was boring because it was only about when he got to Harris's house. I would recommend this book to people who are looking for a good action packed and funny novel."
3,HARRIS AND ME RESPONSE,"I gave the book HARRIS AND ME three stars becuase it is a very exciting story about a boy who goes to live with his relatives on a farm for the summer becuase his parents had some problems. While the boy was on the farm,he met Harris who has an extra ordinary imagination. Together, Harris and the boy do the craziest things like trying to beat up a rooster and getting kicked in the business and much more. Although the book was exciting and funny, it didn't really catch my attention but it's still and excellent book."
5,Harris and Me,"The book I'm reviewing is HARRIS AND ME by Garry Paulson. In this book that's full of comedy, it takes place on Harris' farm. Harris is the kind of 9 year old cussing boy who comes up with the dumbest ideas and tries them out. He and his big imagination gets him and the author into big trouble on the author's summer vacation.I think the author's style is neat because he writes from life experiences. Only people who like comedy and over the age of 8 would like it. What I liked about this book was Harris' personality. I would recommend it. I rate it ""5"" stars and ""two thumbs up"""
4,Funny and Hilarious,"The book HARRIS AND ME was a very funny book. I gave this book four stars because of the hilarious things that went on during the book. One funny thing was that Harris and the narrator were walking through the barn at night and the narrator got kicked in the groin by cow named Vivian. When he got kicked he went 10 feet in the air. Another funny thing that hapened was Harris said the narrator was mental to the girl the narrator liked. In payback, the narrator made Harris pee on an electric fence. In conclusion, I thought this book was funny and i would recomend it to anyone who enjoys a funny book."
4,Harris and Me,"Harris and Me by Gary Paulsen is a good adventure book . In Harris and Me , Me was a city boy. But Me had to move to a farm where his cousin Harris lived. Me had to get used to to the farm.. You will find out if Me gets used to the farm when you read Harris and Me. This book was funny book and happy. So I think if you like funny, happy, and adventure booksm, I think you should read it!"
5,A seat glueing action packed book,"Pat and Bryan say this is a perfect book for any age. This book makes you laugh out loud. With many fun-filled adventures it is hard to put down. We read it for a class assingnment, in Mrs Lebel's class, as a book we pick out and read in a group. Our group finished first because we read ahead even though we weren't supposed to. It is the best book we ever read. We recomend it to everyone!"
5,Harris and Me,Harris and Me was a Hysterial! I especially the time when Harris and Me jumped on the pigs(comiejaps). I recommend this book to kids of all ages who love adventure and humorous stories.
3,ok,i didnt really like this book it had no plot what so ever and it didn follow a story line. the whole book was a bout a boy who moves to the middle of nowhere and gets in a lot of trouble!i do not recomend this book!
1,Inappropiate for young adults,"I would not want my children to read this book. It has bad language, references to pornography, disrespectful children, bathroom humor, and disfunctional families. The funny situations do not make up for the inappropriate content. Not recommended."
5,roller defenser,this blade amazes me it is so good dont pay attention to the 16 stars its practicaly invincible although its a big hassle to build its worth it
3,garbage is a blade called roller defenser,"Well, when I got this from(store name here)it had a minute of spin time. That part is garbage. My dranzer went 1:36 and driger went 1:58. Anyway,I'll give more info.Attack ring: Good defense but not durable at all.It should be a left spin beyblade.Wieght ring: Average.Not much to say. Its pretty rare.Spin gear: Why am I writing this section? Its the screw in kind.Blade base: Good spin patern for a defense type.Overall grade: 4/10"
3,"Interesting, yet too simplistic","I read this book and sat and thought.....hummm...does she even know who I am and what my real problem is. Well, No! She classified me into a group, which makes me just a statistic. I felt really put off by this book. I believe the author is quite intelligent in her field of understanding but I do not feel that she did a great job in helping me overcome my procrastination methods. Essentially, this book did NOT help me. But it could help others less analytical."
1,"It's not the music, it's the editing!!!!","First, the actual title is ""Live In Japan"". The set list is good and the sound quality is fine, but whoever edited this thing should be shot. Some songs fade out, some just stop. Most just start without any fade up or cross-fade, making it very disjointed. Not recommended."
1,Bork Wasn't the First; Thurgood Marshall and Fortas were,"The author conveniently rewrites history by insinuating that the Bork was the first Supreme Court nominee to face below the pale scrutiny in the modern era. We cannot forget the hero of the right wingers, Strom Thurmond, who shamefully attempted to take down Thurgood Marshall. Thurmond tormented Marshall with sixty arcane legal questions and grilled him on three Reoncstruction era Amendments. As head of the Judiciary Committee, Thurmond also blocked the nomination of Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren.Those Republicans who attempt to argue that the Bork nomination began the era of bad feelings and nasty tactics have short memories and are shameless false fact revisionists."
4,Inventive.,"I picked this up while browsing a Sale Cookbook section in a NYC Barnes and Noble.It reminded me more than anything my love of cheese from my early years while growing up in Poland. Oh I loved melting it and putting it in everything I ate.This book gives a great introduction to the types of cheese and what they are good for. It's helpful when facing a cheese display in my favorite grocery store with a look of confusion my face. This breaks it down to great types of cheeses out there and best ways of using them.This book has recipes for cheese sandwiches, soups, baked and fried appetizers and many more branches of cheese use.Great buy, it really focuses on the main ingredient!"
2,Cheap sound for a cheap price,"For less than $5 it does the job you'd expect. It works, but the sound isn't as rich as ipod earbuds, yet the funny thing is these have the same specs as ipod earbuds. 20-20,000 Hz. Impedance 32 Ohms, 4 foot cord length. You can hear the audio clear, but this is obviously the low end of earbuds. Music sounds flat like its played through a tunnel or something."
2,Low quality horror set...,"There are a couple of movie gems in this collection such as White Zombie (1932) and Night of the Living Dead (1968). Most of the films, such as The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price are very poor quality and truncated. Even ""White Zombie"" is fuzzy, but it's still watchable. None of these films appear to be remastered. It's a very low quality set of B movies, but with eleven movies at almost 15 hours of playing time for such a low price it's hard to complain. Get the popcorn popping, turn down the lights, and don't expect too much..."
3,I Liked It,"The Cybil War is a pretty predictable book. You know by the first 40 to 60 pages what is going to happen. But still, I liked it. One of my friends read it and said it was really, really boring. I read it anyway. I'm glad I did because it was pretty good. The characters are a girl named Cybil, a boy named Tony, and another boy named Simon. Tony always lies and takes advantage of Simon. Both Simon and Tony have a mad crush on Cybil. I didn't really think the characters were believeable. I thought that they were too perfect. Even though I felt this way about the characters, I still liked the book."
2,"NOT BIG ENOUGH, DOESNT STAY PUT","If the look and Harley logo are all you want from a floormat and you have a small car, go for it. If you have a truck or large car and are hoping these will actually keep dirt off your carpet, pass this one by. The grippers on the back are shallow and useless and there is not much depth in the front grooves to trap dirt and water. For the price, this is NOT a good buy."
3,Small - durable,"Problem is the strap pulled out within 2 hours of walking around w/ them hanging from my neck. Stripped the insert. They are compact and rubber coated. I'm not familiar w/ optics and quality, but I know when lenses suck. These don't."
4,"""High"" and ""Low"" Art in the 1980's","This is an interesting criticism of art and culture in the 1980's. O.K. Werckmeister explores how such things as Reagan's presidency, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and increased reliance on computer affect popular culture and high art. Werckmeister interestingly compares artists such as the painter Robert Morris with the Star Wars movies or the composer Pierre Boulez with the music group Kraftwerk. At times, his arguements are very ambiguous and the subjects may be a bit dated by now, but in all, it is a worthwhile read."
2,Not what I expected,I remember my mother using one of these. I never noticed her walls filling with water vapor. My dryer is in the basement and really don't want everything I own to wind up with mold on it. The window in my basement is rigged in a fashion where if I try to attach a dryer vent it shifts the whole make shift window and I basically wind up with a gap & no protection. I didn't want to mess around with it but I think I'm going to have to buy a new window that will properly accomodate a dryer vent. I think I actually noticed LESS water vapor when I simply used a panty hose footie on the end of the dryer vent. I was shocked beyond belief when I saw the water running down the cement wall & onto the floor. Perhaps I had the device too close to the wall? Either way I can't continue to put that much water vapor inside of my house. I don't know if other people had this problem or just me?
1,By far the cheapest plastic junk available for your dryer.,"The plastic molding has so many mold flashing that the lid would not close.I spent 30 minutes with a utility knife removing flashing so the lid would close.I could not get the duct to clamp onto the container, more mold flashing?Get some used pantie hose to use as a lint trap.The 4"" X 5 foot vent duct comes much closer to 3 ft long, It does not reach to the top of the dryer."
4,Canon S5IS,Upgraded to a Canon S5 IS & very pleased with the photos. Easy to operate. Enough pixels to allow you to crop & still have an excellent photo. Macro just as easy to operate. Would recommend even to a beginner.
4,Nice!,"Still learning to fully enjoy this camera! The video mode button and still photo combination is a treat. Very smooth movement and good audio.It is winter, so outdoor color is absent in order to see how well the color holds up; but indoor has been fine.I like the feel of some weight in a camera, and that was actually part of my choice. It has a very good grip, and although I have very large hands, I am able to operate all buttons easily enough.The cost was certainly affordable, and as far as some of the negative comments pertaining to the lens cap and batteries falling - what are those folks doing?"
2,Good on features but image quality is lacking,"I'm an amateur photographer and have been shooting with Canon DSLR's for several years now, currently with a 50D. I bought the S5 for its small size compared to an SLR, movie abilities, and extended zoom range.I have to say I'm disappointed overall and will be selling this camera soon. It is high on features but the pictures are very noisy / grainy unless you shoot in bright daylight at ISO100. Anything else and the pictures don't look very good. I would only recommend this camera if you really need the 20x zoom range, but otherwise I would go with something else."
5,Everthing I wanted and more,"This is my third Canon digital camera and by far the best. Although not a DSLR, it's the next best thing. I would call is a ""junior DSLR "" if there was such a thing. It meets my everyday needs to take informal pics here and there, but can also support a variety of advance features.This camera will not fit in your pocket, so expect to buy a case or carry it around your neck. The LCD is large and is easy to see in the sun (I live in AZ!). The lens cap does fall off all the time. That is the one thing bad I can say about this camera.In my opinion, you can't beat a Canon (quality/features for the price)."
4,Advanced Point and Shoot,"I am not a photographer and I am not one to take a lot of pictures, but after going to a friends wedding and then being asked to take a lots of pictures, I borrowed a Powershot for the photos. The shots were great and everyone loved them.This is a great camera and takes high quality pictures quickly. It easy recognizes the faces of people in the shot and with multiple face detector, everyone stays in focus. The only problem that I had with the camera was with the batteries. The camera did not recognize that there were new batteries in it after a week or so and wouldn't even turn on with new batteries. Customer Service at Canon was great and very helpful and I was able to get the camera back just after a week and it works fine now."
4,Very nice photos!,"Results are very good, have good manual controls, excellent supermacro feature, however batteries don't get nothing close to 400 photos, the maximum i have been able to shot without replacing the batteries has been 200 photos. There is a thing i don't like, it is shooting with ISO more than 400, there is too much noise for me."
4,Very good,Very good camera but not for inexpert people. It has many options that requires some knowledges about photography. It's not a camera for a beginner.
4,A great camera!!!!,"This camera does it all. If you read the manual you will be able to take exceptional pictures! If you don't have the focus to sit down and read it (it's pretty hefty) read the basic manual or just start taking pictures. My wife has never taken a decent picture untill we got this camera. It's fool-proof! It literaly is a point and shoot camera. The ""auto"" takes great pictures. Use the TV AV Manual ect you can take AWESOME pictures. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! I reviewed ALOT of cameras for the price, even compared to other more expensive cameras. This is the one!!!"
5,All in one camera,This is an awesome camera. A professional gets his part and an amature gets point and shoot.I have more to talk about its robustnessI accidently dropped this camera on stairs and it rolled down. It made me worried and I prepared myself to buy a new one. But as soon as i picked it from the floor to my surprise everything was intact and it was working.Great product from Canon
4,Great camera for the buddding photographer!,"I really enjoy this camera, even though I purchased it for my wife. The intent was to take macro photos of her soaps that she has for sale, and for that purpose, the camera works great. Really needs a light-box though, and luckily I was able to snap one together real quick. For other photos, really this camera is a blast too. It's quick, on both bootup and saving pictures. Wish I could figure out how to turn the flash off, though - and not get the message ""raise flash"".That said, the only ""negative"" thing I would have to say about it is that the lens cap comes off far too easily."
5,Canon PowerShot Pro What a Great Camera,I wanted a really great camera at a price I could afford. This one fit the bill perfectly. So glad I purchased it.
1,"Kodak ""small"" camera bag","Actually a very large camera bag...very roomy, but difficult to fit in a purse or fanny pack when at an event or amusement park etc."
5,"Brilliant, like Douglas Adams after some serious drinking.",There is a fine line between genius and madness and I'm still not sure which side of it Rankin walks. His main characters Cornelius Murphy and the diminutive Tuppe are simply surreal. After reading this I went out and bought all his other books and I have not been dissapointed yet.
3,"Small and Convenient, Very Slow","The Targus Charger works well, and is convenient to use due primarily to the built in AC plug and the capability of charging from your vehicle's receptacle.However, it's advertised as a ""2 Hour Charger"". The first unit I received I repackaged and returned after having the batterys on charge for 8 hours without showing fully charged. The next unit I received took 10 hours to initially charge the four batteries that are packaged with the charger. Since then, I've found fully discharged batterys require 7 to 10 hours to charge.It's still a good charger if you don't mind the extended time it takes for a full charge; but it definitely is not a ""2 Hour Charger"" as advertised."
5,Looks like a gem so far,"I just received this book, but already its looking like it will be one of those rare gems of biblical writing where I get to make up my own mind rather than the author polluting the topic with his/her own dogma. It is very hard to find a book that is balanced in the genre of religion. Apparently, this author is Jewish, which will be a nice change since most authors on the Abrahamic linage I come across seem to be Christian. I follow the Teaching of Jesus personally, but really enjoy other perspectives besides the same old fiat that gives no critical eye to any of the Bible's history. Yep, I have high hopes for this book. Not many of these around. Even if you are a dyed in the wool traditionalist, you will enjoy the read. I doubt this man will offend you, you'll just dismiss anything that disagrees with your 'rightness' on the subject and move on."
3,stinks,i bought this bey blade and 4 days later i battled a night dranzer and master driger they hit me and the attack ring split in half.
5,Lifts up my heart!,This CD contains the same music I treasured in the 90's until my tape wore out. The music is inspiring and very lively. I I find myself singing along with all my heart and joyously singing in the shower. Luke Garrett knows Jesus and expresses so much emotion in his amazing music.
4,SHOW KITTY,"right front paw was not sewn so as to allow it to rest flat like the other three but aside from that it is exactly what i wanted to display inside my restored classic 1968 mercury cougar. it is very lifelike in apperance and does it's job "" to attract attension to my car"""
4,A very useful manual,"The authors have produced a very clear presentation of how to identify and treat psychodynamic conflicts using active methods. For the beginning therapist, it offers a step by step detailed approach. For the more advanced therapist, it has a very clear and useful organization that provides a resource for thinking about the stuck places in therapy. Both supervisors and supervisees will find it helpful."
5,Excellent Entertainment,"I bought this for my three children (and me). My two year old son loves watching it. My daughters have their favorite episode. The style of the show was refreshing. The theme song was very catchy. I like how they worked in stories from the comic book. I collected the comic ""back in the day."" I would recommend it. The humor is clean, the comedy is clean. It is good entertainment. The DVD stays in the player in the mini-van."
3,To much To late,"This book was poorly written but had a good plot. This is the story of a young woman, Billie James and her encounters with, love, heartache and the other problems teens' today face. The one main thing that I disliked about this book is that fact that the story did not get very exciting until the last 4 chapters. As I started to read the book I wanted to put it down but as the end of the book grew closer I became more and more interested. The problem with having too much at the end was that it leaves you with a dead end in the story. I think the author relates well to teens but writes with an odd style and that threw me off at first. I encourage people who enjoy books about the things real people face to read this, but if you get bored in the beginning keep reading because as you get deeper into the book you will come to find that you love it."
2,Ak Builder Video,"The DVD I recieved is not as advertised,,, I only got one mans view on building a Ak-47 from bar stock and not as discribed... The DVD was also to cover Bending your own flats and screw builds and other subjects that were not at all in this versions even though the DVD cover say it is... I was dissapointed to spend 65 bucks and not reciever the information I wanted.... I would not mind to pay that amount of money if it was as it was advertised but sadly it was not....."
5,terrrific value!,100% Cashmere ScarfI buy several of these scarves every year from this vendor. I am so pleased with the quality and beautiful colors. It is so soft. Everyone I have ever given this scarf to has been so delighted. It fun to be able to make people happy without having to spend a fortune.
1,No Juice,"Would have been great if they had sent the 2 batteries listed in the add. Instead they sent a bare tool, no batteries. Now they want $120.00 more for the batteries. Don't buy from Max Tool"
5,AWESOME!!,"Oh man this CD is just awesome!! My friend recommended listening to them and most of the time I'm just like yea ok whatever, but I decided to try it and I don't regret it!! It's still got the emo in it which I love, but is still upbeat. The songs are so catchy and so much fun to listen to!! Everyone should get this CD!!!"
4,It could happen again,"Although this is a book about a specific place during a specific period, what makes it so chilling is how it describes a descent of little steps into a nightmare world. For those who may even have lived through it thinking ""it wasn't that bad,"" this book provides the opportunity to take a step back and realize ""it was worse than we even imagined."" Ms. Kligman's account is clarion call for the importance of taking a stand in every society in order to preserve the values we hold dear, but which are in fact as fragile as the weakest among us."
3,Product work fine but is misleading...,I am giving it a three star because I did not read anywhere that this was a Nokia exclusive headset meaning no other 2.5mm phone adapter can use it. So the ad seemed misleading to me. Other than that it seems to work fine.
1,Ouch.,"These glasses hurt to wear, don't fit properly over one's ears or nose, and badly interfere with vision. Not recommended for any costume whatsoever."
5,Awesome Camera,I've had this camera for about two years now. It is a really nice camera...not too big in size and it takes better pics than the smaller ones. I enjoy using it. Very rich colors. This camera really capture the pics with the original colors. I take pics in the dark and it works great. Sometimes the pics are too white but with better angle its great.
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,Brings me back! Arrived quick and in perfect shape. Thank you Disney for releasing the Generations Collection. Now I have to start buying to show these to my kids.
3,Great for display but not for play,"This is a great display item, being a Simpsons fan, but don't expect to actually use it much. The input openings on the bottom of each character used for voice recognition doesn't fit too well into the tab that's on the set. When you put a character on, it's difficult to get it to click into place and even more difficult to remove. When I finally got Maggie off a tab, the bottom clips on her were a little stressed (the plastic turned white a little). Overall, I really can't complain because it was so cheap - on sale for pretty cheap."
3,huh?,"I got excited around 2am when I saw this was five bucks with free shipping. I think it'll be one of those things that will sit in my room for a long time where i'll wonder to myself ""what was I smoking when I got this and where can I get some more?"""
1,Worst image quality I have ever seen on a DVD!,"Having seen tidbits of this panel online I was intrigued and wanted to see the whole thing, upon finding it available for purchase I was beyond thrilled, even though I didn't particularly care for the price tag. The panel didn't disappoint, but I was utterly appalled by the quality of the footage.It was heavily pixilated and completely awkward to watch - I've seen home videos dating back to the 80's with better quality - so to be expected to pay 20$ for this and get such crap quality in return is utterly appalling to me.I can only hope the contribution from me and others who have purchased this DVD will go towards updating the Paley Center's camera equipment so that future panels will be filmed on equipment dating from THIS century. Until that happens I will not be purchasing anymore DVDs from them - it's NOT worth the money."
2,Didn't work,"This battery didn't work in my laptop, even though the Inspiron 600m is one of the listed computers for this battery. I guess I just got a defective one. The good news is, Amazon's return procedure is very easy to do and hassle-free."
3,Notebook Battery,"the charge does not last that long, it only lasted 20 minutes, which is the most important feature of any battery."
4,"Great Product, Wish It Had A Backlight","After looking (and purchasing) several switches to control my 3 way fluorescent outside lights I finally bought the STO1C and it worked perfectly out of the box. The unit turns on at sunset and off at sunrise with minimal programming skills.I like the fact that it has a mechanical switch electronically controlled. No more flicker or problems with ballasts.The installation video on U Tube is far better than the instructions that come with the timer and, following the video (using the same colored wires) I had no problems wiring the switch in a 3 way configuration.Re-programming is a bit of a chore without any back lighting and a little bigger LCD display with better graphics would be an improvement.All in all I gave it 4 stars and would have given 5 if it had a back light and more readable graphics.Great switch for the price!"
4,difficult to understand and use for a toddler,"This will probably work better for an older, logical minded child. If you don't have your train entering in the right direction, it will stop before entering the shed. so then you have to throw the switch the other way to have the train stop when in the shed in loadable position. My 2 year old is more interested in opening, and pulling off that red roof door than in the stop and go action. I am able to fix that roof back on with no problems so far, but I wish it would not come out in the first place!He is able to relate to and use the simple stop and go switch much much better. So for the driving through a building action I think one of the fix-it or special engine shed type buildings is better, and you can combine with a separate switch."
4,Artifacts: A Faye Longchamp Mystery,"Another great Kindle find! The writing skillfully unfolded the interesting plot, which I thought moved along at exactly the pace required for this book. The editing was absolutely letter-perfect, a major coup in the Kindle universe, with not so much as an abused comma anywhere. Only two things kept me from total enjoyment of Artifacts. One was the fear that Faye's technically illegal activities were going to cause her huge headaches, and not wanting to be too captivated by someone who could bend the law so easily. The other was the fear of liking Joe and Faye too much, only to be forced to witness their horrifying deaths. While the book did have its terrifying moments, the writer didn't turn it into the kind of psychological thriller that I find just too overpowering to read. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series."
3,Difficult to not be offended,"It was difficult reading a book where the main character was part African American but whose background had no cultural foundation in the black community. As a result there was a lot of stereotypical comments about race, hair, and how mixed race people are not accepted in th black community. Some of the comments made about black perceptions haven't existed for the last 40-50 years.It was difficult to get a time fix for when this story was supposed to have taken place. If it was supposed to be today's era, okay but it felt like the 1960s because of the stereotypes stated above. This was confusing.Basically I had to skip over or ignore the timeframes and racial comments that did not fit. The main character felt distant, fake."
2,Basic Business 101 With Tiny Snippets of Vince,"This book is really not about Lombardi's coaching style, but a very simple business book with Lombardi's name ""shoe horned"" into the text. The ""lessons"" are all very basic intuitive business themes that Vince Jr. (or the publisher) has tried to connect with some aspect of his father's personality. Might be good for a school age kid, but any working professional has heard these lessons hundreds of times before. If you are looking for a book on Lombardi, try something else."
5,Great,I am a huge sports fan and parents bought this for me for my birthday. Great story even for those that are not sport fans and just want to take in wisdom on life. This book should be on everyone's book case for those who just want to succeed better in life. Great for people in leadership positions and or people that will be in leadership positions in the future.
2,Expecting something different,"I was expecting a book with a story. Instead it is a book of one thought on each page. It is small about 3"" by 4"". From the picture I thought it would be about the size of a standard paperback book."
5,Read it every month,"I've had this book a while and was curious why it didn't have a 5 star rating. If you live in Northern California this book is very informative and very well presented. It is the only garden reference I've read cover to cover, but that is due to its layout taking you through the season month by month. Yes, it does not have photos, but if you actually take the time and read you'll find it very informative and even discover information about drought tolerant plants."
4,Great reference,"This is a fantastic reference book, and is a fine companion to Sunset for those of us living in NorCal. I would cut Katherine Grace Endicott's gardening articles out of the San Francisco Chronicle as a young girl, they were so informative and full of love for the regional flora. The only drawback I have found in this book, purely by accident, is the missing pages in the index covering Cs, Ds and Es (would be between pp 320-321). Bummer! I hope she fixes this in the next edition. Otherwise a classic."
4,Lots of great info for our area!,"THis is a great book to help us begginer Gardeners to understand all of our micro climets, and what to be doing each month!"
3,Good basic information,"Overall, a good introduction to the handling and management of stallions. Packs a lot of information into a fairly small space, with detail on stallion physiology, training stallions to breed, breeding facilities, and methods for handling and housing stallions.Caveat, however: the text portion of the book is only 60 pages long. True, it's packed with facts and illustrations, but I felt a little cheated when I realized that the last 40 pages of the book were simply photos of famous stallions with a little explanatory text."
