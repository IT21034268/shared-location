4,Comprehensive but hard to read,"There is no doubts this text is a comprehensive study of Monte Carlo methods with an impressive number of examples. However, I must say it is hard to read for someone who is beginning to work with Monte Carlo methods. I highly recommend the book by Sobol (A primer for the Monte Carlo Method) which I think it remains to be the best introduction to the subject. After reading and enjoying this primer you will be ready to take full advantage of Robert and Casella's book."
5,really fun,I have owned this game for a while. I love the cartoon eggs. I like Tetris but often find it boring after playing it for any length of time. I think the cartoon nature and presentation of this game is why I like this tetris style game. It is very easy to learn. There are lots of little tools you can use to help yourself and mess up your enemies. The music is great. The graphics are beautiful. It is a great puzzle game and a wonderful way to waste time.
5,LIKE ACTION ? THIS IS THE BOOK!,"""EDGE OF TOMORROW""IS A GREAT READ. A REAL PAGE TURNER.I FOUND IT HARD TO PUT DOWN. I WANTED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS FAST MOVING ADVENTURE.I HAVE READ MOST OF TOM CLANCY'S WORK AND CONSIDER THE ""EDGE OF TOMORROW"" AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER.I HOPE MR. WOOTAN WILL CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK. I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT BOOK."
4,Angry Blonde.,I thought it went more into the lyrics but not really. It's basically a book of lyrics that has a short paragraph explanation of every song.
4,Overal a decently entertaining book,"This being my first Dale Brown book, i feel that overall i enjoyed this book, even though at times it was rather repeatative. I enjoyed this book and, even though slow at times, I would read another Dale Brown book."
1,don't give up,"If this is the first book you've read written by Dale Brown, do yourself a favour and go back and read the others.......they were good......this is not. Dale Brown is at home in the air, and so is Patrick McLanaghan. Neither do so well on the ground. Sorry Dale, but this is the first of all your books I couldn't be bothered finishing......I was continually trying to work out why Patrick was still alive considering all the mistakes he was making. On the street...and I know.....brains and experience will never be replaced by technology, no matter how good it is. I guess I'll finish it one day, just to see whether Patrick somehow manages to blunder through, but for all our sakes, including yours, both of you should be back in the air, where you belong."
1,Bad? worse!,"I am a fan of Mr Brown's aviation books. I can't believe it's him that wrote this drivel. Please don't buy it, buy any of his ""Old Dog"" books instead."
1,I think his wife wrote it.,"I like Dale Brown. I think I have almost all of his books. And I think I've figured out a pattern. So far, each one has been about airplanes. And each one has been, presumably, written by him. Following me so far? Ok. Now, out of the blue, he ""writes"" a book that has nothing to do with aviation, and it is not good. Oh no, not good at all. Did you notice how the whole acknowledgments section says how his wife gave him all this information and research? I think she helped a whole lot more than that."
5,Simply Gorgeous!,"These earrings are gorgeous! They look exactly like the picture. So if you're thinking about getting them go ahead, you won't be sorry."
2,Disappointed,"The earrings I received did not resemble the ones from the picture on this web site. The very bottom bead in the picture is a very pretty pink-ish color and that's what I was looking forward to when I ordered these. Well, the earrings I recieved had more green on the bottom bead than pink. I didn't like the fact that there was more green than pink and I didn't think it was worth returning them so I literally got out a bottle of pink nail polish and just painted them the shade that I wanted. Wasn't what I expected but you get what you pay for."
4,Jackass,"Alright this is an awesoem dvd 2 hrs of just pure awesomeness, but I have one prob....it's censord, but yet one of the songs you here them say the ""F"" word int he background but when everyone else doz it doz that stupid beep noize thats my only prob with the dvd. + mine came witha free jackass shirt!"
5,Been waitin,"Finaly the jackass volumes may be complete. Where else (other then steve-o and cky/viva la bam) do ya see panks, stunts, and acts of pure stupidity that make ya puke and laugh at the same time! If this is uncensord (like i hope) keep away from children at all costs (nvm just do that anyways cus this makes ppl big dummies). Ima hopin for tha best."
4,Cobra Digital camera,For a cheaper camera the picture quality is great. The screen on back is extremely small that is my only complaint. Otherwise good camera.
5,A wonderful toy,"At first I was worried as this was a little pricier than the others but my husband I both think that our daughter ""deserves the best"" so we bought it and from the first moment she loved it at 4 months of age. She has continued to enjoy if for the month that we have had it and it is always good for 20 or 30 minutes of activity every day!! Her face just lights up and she smiles so big when we put her in it! So I would suggest this for any baby who loves toys that light up and make music."
1,PLEASE WATCH OUT!!!,"My daughter got her arm, wrist and palm of her hand pinched in the track when she moved the seat sideways. At first, I thought it was a fluke and continued to put her in the toy. Then it happened 2 more times...once I had to pull her hand out...the skin was pinched between the seat and track. I called Fisher Price and they were very apologetic and will be sending UPS out to pick up the toy and reimburse me the retail cost. I really did LOVE this toy and so did my daughter."
5,Long Lasting toy,We purchased this for our daughter when she was four months old. At that time she loved being in the seat and playing the music. She loved to babble to the mirror amd grab the microphone. She is now 11 months old and still loves to play with it. We have taken the seat out now so she can walk thru it. It is still one of her favorite toys. I would highly recommend this toy.
3,One broken key,"After much debate at the store, my husband and I decided on this toy for our 4 month old daughter. We brought it home, assembled it, put the batteries in and...one of the foot keys didn't work. In addition, she seems to get overstimulated after about 10 minutes. Back to the store for this one. My advice would be to put the batteries in first (c's) and hook up the foot pedals to make sure everything works before assembly."
1,Beware! This thing can pinch!!!,"My little girl absolutely loved hers, but we ended up taking it back for a refund. If you have one, try this out: The yellow plastic part of the seat can pinch their fingers/hands quite easily. All they have to do is put their finger slightly underneath the edge of it and then walk in that direction. My daughter got pinched so badly. I tried it out myself to see if this was maybe a one time occurance but found it easy to do. I took it back and the store said that they had similar complaints. Sooooo.... too bad. Because she loved playing in it!! :("
5,BEST TOY!!,"We bought this for Christmas when our son was just 2 months old. We started using it when he was about 3 months old, and he loved it!! He would just play in it for hours. We loved that he was able to be moblie (sliding back and forth), but not all over the house. It is a larger toy, but we would put it in the back of our SUV and take it to our friend's houses, and their kids would run over and want to play with it. The only thing I have to say is now that our son is almost a year old he doesn't play with it anymore. As for the finger pinching that some people report, I did notice that this could happen, but it never happened to us. Overall though I would defintely say this toy is worth the money we paid for it."
5,My sons favorite,My son is 6 months old and he really enjoys the piano. The first 2 or 3 times he didnt really understand he could move the seat himself and that he made the music. Now he understands and plays music all day. He loves the little toys and lights. It saves me many nights on sleep he plays in it until he is tired and then he gets a full night of sleep as so I.
4,She loves it- I hate the music,"My daughter loves this- she is 5 months old. It has settings so that she can play a whole song, part of a song, or just the instruments. She also loves to chew on the microphone. I just can't stand the songs- they play in my nightmares over and over and over. But, I guess that could be true of any child's toy. She has never injured herself in it as some of the reviews have reported- perhaps we've just been lucky. The keys that she steps on do not light up, just the upper keys."
3,GREAT TOY WITH SEAT,THIS TOY IS EXCELLENT WHEN THE SEAT IS ATTACHED. ONCE THE SEAT IS REMOVED FOR OLDER BABIES THE BASE BECOMES WIGGLY AND THE CHILD CAN MOVE IT EASILY.
4,don't go by others,"Sure enough after reading all these wonderful reviews I bought it for my daughter (who was 5 m at the time). She'd stay in it for a little while, and would start to cry. I had removed the seat since she began cruising, hoping she'd like it better, but no such luck. She'd rather play with our dog's bowls. While the toy (I think) is great, there's no guarantee your little one will like it."
1,disapointing!!,"I brought this product for my daughter on christmas and at first it was fine she loved it. But then about two weeks later I hear a screaching sound from her and when I looked her little finger was stuck under the little yellow bell. I removed the bell so that she could still enjoy her toy but then About a week later she screamed again and I thought what now, and her palm of her hand was pinched between the yellow slidding seat and the white base!! I don't know what to do now. I paid $89.99 plus tax which came out to $96.?? and some change. It has brought pain to my daughter twice. If fisher price is reading this I think you should recall step&play piano because it's dangerous for babies and reimburse me also. sincerly a concerned parent,Amy Reyes"
5,"Great for collectors, not for playing","I already have some Leia collectibles, but the price of this is not bad at all, under $10 at time of this review, so I decided to buy it. It's a great ""doll"" for collectors, but it's durability is not good enough for play."
1,on-time + out-of-date,"The book arrived on time. I was looking for history and expected some dated chapters, unfortunately the content was absolutely outdated and very shallow, not for college level."
2,I really wanted to love it...,"After throughly enjoying the use of my Visor Deluxe for 2 years, I dropped it and broke the screen. I decided to upgrade to the Edge because of it's sleek looks. I bought and returned 6 -- countem -- 6 Edges -- each of them hard a hardware problem of some sort. The first 3 I purchased directly from Handspring. #1's backlight didn't work, #2's screen was not installed straight, #3 had a screw hanging out and would not slide into the charger. The next three I purchased locally at CompUSA. #4 would bring up the memo screen anytime a slight pressure was applied near the switch (as if the memo button was pressed), #5 had a sprung flip cover, and although the box was sealed, it had someone's data loaded onto it!, and finally #6's backlight didn't work. Sheesh! I am waving my white flag -- I have been beat!So now, I have a Visor Pro on order. Wish me luck!"
2,**DIED**,"The Handspring Visor Edge provided 5 months of wonderful usage until one night when I was riding with some of my friends going to Tulsa I decided to play some games on it, so I take it out and I noticed that it said fatal error, so I thought well no big deal I just perform a soft reset and it will be fine but when I performed a soft reset it would load up and then it said fatal error then I performed another soft reset still nothing worked then I tried a hard reset nothing, nothing would work and what was really bad the power button did not respond so I could not conserve the batteries until I got back from the trip. Well when I got back the batteries must have totally drained down because the screen was blank."
4,Worth the money,"I bought my visor edge about seven mounths ago for school and to help me stay organized. So far I am pleased with how it is working for me. Images are not very clear on the screen. If you are going to buy a PDA, I would reccomnd buying one with color. I am happy with my investment"
2,Got it cheap-as it should be,"Got it in Japan forn (price). Very rarely can you find anything cheaper here than in the US. Wonder why? My biggest problem is I expect it to fail soon after reading reviews and experiencing the horrid Handspring website. But frankly, though it is small and slim, the thing looks and feels cheap and fragile. The flimsy aluminum lid and plastic hinge are destined to break. To attach Springboard you remove this flimsy thing and it is no longer slim. THe lid will not fold back out of the way when you open it. If I had to pay the over (...)price some people pay, I'd be very disgusted. SHould have checked the reports of crashes before buying, even at this low price. They must be desperate--losing business?"
4,"Interesting stuff for the ""Magnum"" crowd.","For those of us who got hooked on the 80's TV series this book is an overdue treat. Lot's of good photo's and at least a few interesting insights into the making of the series from on of the co-stars. I was disappointed, however, in the superficial treatment given to the relationships between the show's regulars. One day perhaps we'll learn what it was really like to be cooped up on a lava rock in the middle of the Pacific with a nonstop fan contingent hungry to learn about your every move. There has to be some interesting stories in there somewhere. In any case, the book does bring back some warm memories of those Thursday nights spent in front of the tube just wishing I could be half as cool as Tom Magnum."
4,"Humor, entertainment and education all in one","The start is a little slow if this is the first of Leo's books you've read, but once you hit the second chapter, you're hooked. We meet Fire Fighter on Probation Donald Holden when he first starts his love affair with the Boston Fire Department. He becomes friends with a strange cast of characters in the fire department, goes through training and learns what it takes to be a firefighter, finding the one job that will enchant, puzzle and fill him with pride."
2,Disappointed,"My son could no longer commit to playing in the school band but still wanted to play some on his own. We returned the leased drum and pad to the school and bought this. This is so dull sounding it took all the fun away. It seems well made and sturdy. The sticks that come with it are merely 6"" long 1/2"" dowel pieces. So he obviously preferred his real drum sticks but just lost all interest in playing when this was all he had."
2,What was that? I can't hear you over the noise of the train motor!,"Got this for my nephew. It tends to jump the tracks. It is supposed to make train sounds and play music, but you can't hear either because the volume level (not adjustable) is way too low and the motor on the train is obnoxiously loud. It sounds like someone is grinding up metal in a blender."
1,Don't be fooled by the price....the train is very cheap.,"I bought this train to go around my Christmas tree and I am very disappointed. The track takes up a lot of space and the train does not stay on the track. Also, the loud noise the train makes is ridiculous! I was so excited to find the train at such a low price point....now I know why. Don't waste your money. Mine is going back to the store."
2,Annoying,This train makes an annoying buzzing/humming sound that is louder than the music it plays. I will be returning this train in hopes of a better find.
5,Still Golden After 14 Years,"Cracker's 3rd Studio album the 1996 ""The Golden Age"" #63, was 3 years after ""kerosene Hat"". This little gem has grungey guitar workouts like ""I Hate My Generation"" #13 modern rock and ""Sweet Thistle Pie"" #33 mainstream rock, the country-rock tinged title track and the psychedelia of ""Bicycle Spaniard"". Overall this album has so many different sounds people could be turned off by this, but to me it's what makes it fresh and exciting some 14 years later. Other great songs: ""I'm A Little Rocket Ship"",""Big Dipper"", ""100 Flower Power Maximum"",""Dixie Babylon"" and ""How Can I Live Without You"". The main band on the Golden Age: David Lowery,Johnny Hickman, Charlie Quintana and Bob Rupe. Other notables: Johnny Hott(House of Freaks)."
4,The Most Overlooked Album of 1996,"The Golden Age is Cracker's most completely satisfying album thus far. It demonstrates a wide range of styles and moods not found on their other three albums. It is also much more of a ""studio"" experience than the others, meaning that the songs on this album are a bit more difficult to perform live with the same affect as the album has on the listener at home (By the way, a live Cracker performance is routinely one of the best live experiences around and is probably their strongest selling point for me still). From the opening fury of ""I Hate My Generation"" to the concluding beauty of ""Bicycle Spaniard,"" this album never loses steam even through the slowest of songs. The album is held together, alternately and sometimes simultaneously, by David Lowery's wry, cynical lyrics and the rest of the band's outstanding musicianship."
2,Wish it was Hauter,The color I have is purple. The eyeshadow texture is kind of dry. The color is one of the prettiest shades of purple I've seen but it has a hint of hot pink irridescent undertone which tends to look bruisy on me since my skin is reddish. I feel like without that it would look better on more skin tones.
1,If you are looking for a good movie...,"Oh, my, God!!! I can't tell you how long it's been since I've seen a movie as bad as this one. I feel sorry for the reviewer who paid $6 to rent it.It doesn't take too much to entertain me; a good storyline and decent acting will do. Well, I made myself (and my poor husband) suffer through it just because I like to finish what I start, but it was a waste of time and money.Don't get me wrong. I am a Christian AND love the whole Revelation-Apocaliptic genre, and even with that in favor of the movie I feel it was terrible all around. Bad Cast, bad acting, cheap production.Listen to me: Pick up a book instead. It's a little more work but you will be much more satisfied. (The Christ Clone Trilogy is excellent!)"
4,Excellent movie,"This is an excellent movie in the apocalypse series.This one is Part IIIThe movie is a bit conusing in the first 15-25 minutes or so because they portray events which took place before even the events of thr first movie took place.The first 5 minutes of this movie take place some 30 years before the first movie starts and the nest 15-20 minutes take place some 3 months before the first movie.This may not be apparent the first time you view the film. It wasn't for me, but it may be for others.This film portrays the Tribulation which takes place after the Rapture.A man who slipped into a coma before the Rapture and wakes up several months later, some good time after the Rapture has happened. He searches for family and loved ones and learns about what happened and that it was the doing of God himself and that the Antichrist is now in control of a one world government.They try to let more know about Jesus and save them from losing their souls to Satan."
3,Would love to give 5 stars,"This should've been a better movie. Unfortunately, some of the main characters were not at their best but great performances were given by Sherri Miller (Busey's wife) and Howie Mandel (who knew!). This movie doesn't really advance the series but just seems to be a few months ahead of where Revelation left off and deals with basically the same material except that it's happening to a new set of players on grander sets with better special effects. Overall, a little above average but still a notch below mainstream video fare-- hopefully this is just growing pains for the industry. I'd love to give 5 stars just for the fact that they've tackled this subject matter but I don't think these films are at that level...yet. -- Moza"
4,Good Place To Get Janet Classics,"If you don't want to pay to get Janet's past albums, this is a good supplement as this covers most of the bases!SIDENOTE: I wish these people who continue to put Janet down because of the SuperBowl would get over it! Yes, it was wrong but Janet wasn't the only culprit in that incident (I remember a certain Timberlake being involved too)! Besides, this is a review of a CD, not a political forum! There are other sites where you can air your views on that. If you want to give it a bad review because it stinks, then that's cool but if its because of the SuperBowl....well, you got issues!"
4,I wanted some Janet Jackson,This is a great album and is just what it advertises. I like it but it is just not a favorite. Janet Jackson has a nice voice but it is a little too soft for my tastes.
3,Worth the purchase?,"If you own ""Control"" or ""Rhythm Nation,"" is there a purpose to buying this seemingly uncomprehensive hits collection (in regards to her janet. album)? No. But, if you're a fan of the 80's Janet, enjoy yourself, you'll be at home with this collection.I will admit that this is worth the purchase if only for ""Twenty Foreplay,"" one of Janet's more sensual ballads."
2,Poorly Designed Decade,"This is the only Janet album that I very rarely play. For die-hard Janet fan like myself,this Album felt rushed and not a lot of effort put into it. I would recommend this Cd to those who know little about her legacy and want a nice sample of what they may have missed from that early decade. I believe all Janet's hits cannot be contained on one CD...when she finally retires from music, you will need a box set to fully appreciate what a true Icon she has become. I especially was disappointed that many of the tracks were edited versions of the original, though this is a small mis-step for newer fans, this is a major one for long-time fans who appreciate a masterpiece when they hear it."
4,decade of dazzle,"Janet has been able to impress us since her record breaking release of Control and in this great collection of all of her greatest hits she impresses us even more w/ the two new releases of ""Runaway"" and ""Twenty Fourplay"". I can't wait for her next collection of great songs!!"
2,Celtic Dance Music....very fun,"Brigid Boden's fresh and joyous Irish sound mixed with fun dance tracks. Worth listening to, not a must."
2,"Left overs, minimal meat","Personally, I think Harry is best with some big sound and more focus. I do like jazz and the blues, but can't really use this record to suggest that he is focused on any thing of great substance or something worth remembering.Clearly, an extremely talented and 'multitasked' artist, but perhaps trying to do too much or be too many things."
3,This is not Mr. Connick's usually Stuff,"I bought this CD cause I have bought others that he has produced and enjoyed the music that he has put out. I espically enjoy it when he sings some of these songs. However, all this is him and a piano. This sounds like an improv session in the studio while making a different CD."
5,Everything Catholic,This book is a complete Catholic reference with sufficient sources for additional information. Excellent history of the church and catechism brief reference.
5,The Broken Shore,"I really enjoyed this book. I know a lot of Australians so liked getting down to the nitty gritty stuff. The story line was excellent and kept me gripped to the end. The only problem was I found is the bad language. I couldnt pass this book onto my book club, club house or library in the USA because I think patrons would be offended by the really down and gritty language. It didnt bother me because I am British and bad language is almost the vogue. The story line was fabulous and I would really like to see the author use the main detective in another novel. I quite miss him."
1,A disappointing watch band,"The band clasp design for this watech is a complete disappointment. I've been carrying the watch, not as a wrist watch, but as a pocket watch. The watch band was so disappointing that I just kept it on my desk for some time. Last week I took it with me on a trip to Atlanta. At some point, even though the watch was kept in my pants pocket, one part of the clasp just diappeared. I assume that, as I took the watch out to look at it, the now missing part of the band must have fallen off. Once again, I couldn't be more diappointed in the watch. I intend to return it for a refund."
2,Difficult to use,Seemed like a good idea for grating stick cinnamon but turned out to be impractical.Too small and hard to hold while grating.Requires too much time for minimal results.
5,a helpful connection,"Used this in conjunction with the Katadyn Pocket Water Microfilter on a recent backpacking trip in the Desert Southwest. It adds nominal weight and what i really like about it was that it efficently hooked up to my Camelback system as well as my partners Nalgene system. It works extremely well. Output, as expected, is luscious cool tasty clean water."
5,Katdyn Carbon Catridge,Just received this product and it fits standard water bottles for my bug out bag. Easy to use and confident in the product with the Katadyn name.
5,Does as advertised at a very low price,"I received this item quickly from Tiger Direct. It was pure plug and play, has excellent software and answering machine flexibility. Just what I wanted. Fast and cheap."
4,Excellent modem at a cheap price.,"I have a compaq running windows ME, installed quickly with no hangups at all, its actually the first piece of hardware that loaded, installed with included software that actually worked without having to call tech support.. its really a great deal for the price and no major configuing needed for this puppy.. smooth easy sailing.. love it."
5,Gorgeous :),"This nail polish beautifully compliments my brown skin, I love this color. This is a good brand as well, my color really lasted awhile. I'm good at not chipping my nails, I can normally go about two weeks before my nails start looking worn and this one lasted me three! :)"
1,bubbly bombshell,"I bought bubbly bombshell cause the color looked tempting but was disappointed, the color is no where near what is shown in the picture it is pink just suited for little girls,guess I would pass it on to my grand daughter"
2,deceiving picture,"I expected a pretty bright color, but all I got is a thin watery neon looking pink that I could have purchased at the dollar store, the polish was shipped pretty quick thats why I gave 2 stars."
5,Great service and product,"I am very happy with the extremely fast and smooth delivery. The nail polish was wrapped nicely, so nothing could happen. The colors are awesome. Thank you for a pleasant experience."
4,~Pretty Polish But Not The Same Color As In Picture Shown~,I loved this color when I saw it on line and immediately purchased it..But once I recieved it and applied it to my nails the color is darker than the one pictured...The actual color of this is fuchsia which is a pretty color but not the color I expected..Which is why I gave this 4 stars...But it's still a great polish..You can't go wrong with Orly!:)
3,They sent me a different version of the polish..,"It seems there are two different versions of this polish..The one in the picture with the grey cover and another one that even tough it has glitters it s more of a goldish/ orange color and the cover is black, that s the one they sent me.I wanted to get this polish to use over white polish to appreciate the lilac glitters more but it looks yellowish instead, not what I wanted I have to say..."
1,Deeply disturbing,This book is about people who had 'horrible' experiences at young ages which have been detrimental to the rest of their lives.One HORRIBLE experience summarized: I was three. Everyone outside was running around looking in bushes and talking because someone had robbed a store in the neighborhood. They thought the man could be hiding in the neighborhood. Everyone was looking around and I was alone and separated from the crowd. No one noticed me. No one cared about me. I made a critical decision that day that no one cared about me and I wasn't important.There were many more HORRIBLE stories such as this one. I guess I just didn't get this book.
3,Starts like a romantic comedy... rather confusing...,"At first I thought this was going to be a sweet romantic comedy. The romance fades quickly, as does the humor. Now, I'm just saying this to warn anyone else who picks up this marvelous play that if you expect a romantic comedy, you will be disappointed, as I was. I had to step back and take it in again for what it was and found a truly marvelous and real piece. Some of the language gets confusing at points (I thought to myself, ""Is this an inside joke that I don't get?""). But all around it's a very well-written and very real play. It evokes the feel of Neil Simon, and the reality of Tony Kushner. I'd love to see it staged somewhere."
3,Not So Good,"I really enjoy reading Jennifer Crusie's books--but Fast Women was really weak. The book plods along and even the murder mystery is rather boring. Skip this one.That said, I did enjoy the scenes with the main characters stolen dog--probably the funniest parts of the book.Overall, I was bored and sometimes confused over the main characters, some of whom are so barely sketched out that remembering them was difficult."
2,fast women,"Well here we are once again , disapointed. so far none have compared to her' Tell me lies'....Im sorry, but I just feel she's trying way to hard.and it just doesn't work. I didn't feel good about this one."
2,don't waste your time,this book was ridiculous. the characters don't shut up-a non-stop stream of talking. i couldn't even finish the book it was so silly. don't waste your time
3,Not A Good Cruise Read,"This book falls short of the style and humor we expect from Jennifer Cruise. All of the characters are unrealistic, including the dog,Marlene. When Nell comes to work for Gabe and Riley the plot starts developing neatly.Then the introduction of the other characters and further subplots started muddying the story-line. Nell's friends,Suze and Marge did not seem like real women with their peculiar men and their involvements in the various absurd situations that arose.Nobody seemed to possess a real personality and were almost one dimensional.Gabe and Nell's fights and the falling into bed became quite tiresome and went on much too long for me to believe that they could ever make.yet they ultimately did.This book became quite tedious;I had to work to get thru it and was glad to see the end.."
3,Not impressed,"I love Jennifer Cruise. ""Welcome To Temptation"" is one of my favorite books. I live in Columbus, Ohio, as does Ms. Cruise, so I really enjoyed knowing the areas & places she wrote about.That said, this book was definitely not one of her best! There were too many characters and as such too many of them were one-dimensional.The constant fighting between Gabe & Nell gave me a headache! Her night with Riley was totally unecessary! And Nell's attitude was very confusing. She was partners with her ex in his insurance agency which she basically ran. She was hired by Gabe as a SECRETARY but from her first day (long before they became involved) she was trying to change everything about his business to suit herself. Then she says if she ""caves in"" to Gabe on the changes she will be ""selling herself into bondage"" yet again. I can't understand how it can be bondage if she's controlling everything.Glad I bought this book used!"
1,Very Disappointing,"Up until this book, I was a huge Crusie fan. I've bought & read all of her books & not regretted it...until now. I returned this one to the store when the heroine had sex with the hero's cousin within the first 75 pages of the book. Call me a prude, but that was a bit much for me. After this, I couldn't really respect Nell (the heroine) again, and I sure couldn't take to the hero, since he was so cavalier about the whole thing (let's not even talk about the cousin! He was in a relationship at the time.). Truthfully, this book has now turned me off of Ms. Crusie forever. I'll borrow her books if they're in the library, but I'm sure not spending anymore money on them."
3,Fast Women,"This was an okay book-some romance, some mystery, a lot of cheating. An overall interesting story about 3 women and how their lives intertwin with each other and with a detective agency who mostly uncovers cheating spouses."
2,Not as much fun as I expected. I wouldn't recommend it.,"I didn't enjoy the two main characters as much as I enjoyed her characters in other books. I'm not sure why. There was some humor, but not enough to recommend the book. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2001. Genre: romantic mystery."
1,"Poor, poor, poor.","There needs to be a rule made: Any person or persons tasked with putting together an artists ""definitive collection"" should be required to have at least a passing interest in the artists music. This was slapped together by Hip-O Records, which is a label under Interscope records that does nothing but put compilations together. If you're new to Dave Hollister, do yourself a favor and buy all of his CD's through Amazon's re-sellers. You will come out the same or cheaper, and then you can put together your own collection. If you're not new to Dave, you know I speak the truth. This is no more than a collection of the singles that were released with a few tracks thrown in from other periods of Dave's career. Don't judge Dave by this, please."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. From the description, I expected photographs from the 1930s and 40s, providing a historic view of Los Angeles from the period of many of Chandler?s novels. Instead, the photographs, which are usually dark and sometimes fuzzy, were taken during the 70s and early 80s. In some cases, the table of contents doesn?t even reference the correct page numbers. I wouldn?t recommend this one. You'd be better off renting ""The Big Sleep"" DVD."
5,Great Video,"This video is great it showcases britneys many talents. although on 2 songs she doesnt sing live. But she does actually sing to ""dont let me be the last to know"" ""sometimes"" ""from the bottom of my broken heart"" and ""born to make you happy"" I only bought this tape at first to see the saturday night live skits again! She was hilarious! But as i watched the entire tape i realized what a talent britney truly is.. and she also seems like such a nice and down to earth person! In conclusion Enjoy this video"
5,Britney has yet another awesome video!!!,"This video is another dandy to watch! Has more footage of the Hawaii concert that wasn't shown on T.V. It is really just a summary of what she did all year. From Saturday Night Live to, ""Stronger."" This video shows how normal she is compared to what many people think of her! She even drops by a fans house!!! Can you believe that? Not many ""superstars"" would do something like that! This video also shoes Brit with her friends! And it also shows Brit with her dancers, getting ready for the concert! Beautiful scenary!Overall~great video! Can't wait for her next video! Well, worth the money spent! Will bring years and years of joy!"
2,Connects to dial up immediately....but that's about it,"After spending up to two frustrating hours each attempt trying to log on to my dial up internet service (utilizing a factory installed modem on my Dell computer), I was initially overjoyed with the immediate internet connection the Modem Blaster V.92 provided. This was short lived, however, because with this convenience came following new inconveniences: (1) MUCH slower speed opening web pages than promised (in fact, slower than Dell's factory modem); (2) Modem Blaster creates loud bussing on all phones anytime the it is plugged in to the phone line even with the computer shut down; (3) Complete loss in ability to listen to streaming web music.Don't let your wallet get blasted by the Modem Blaster V.92 and purchase a different modem that has a better performance and consumer satisfaction record."
1,Piece of junk,"I've been building and troubleshooting computers since the early '90's, and I picked up one of these for a friend's almost new Toshiba laptop whose own modem was faulty. I spent a whole day trying to get it to work, nothing but odd error messages and stuff. And of course the usual too many programs that Creative wants to install (which I let happen just to ensure that it was a standard install). After about nine hours, I went back to BestBuy and returned this modem and got a cheapo Dynex pcmcia 56k modem for the same price. It worked on the first try.Creative Labs really isn't a name I trust anymore."
5,Movie Collector,"I love this movie! I remember this one as a child myself! It's refreshing to watch good, clean television! Gotta love it!"
1,Bait and switch,"I remember watching ""The Cat in the Hat"" on TV as a youngster. The great interaction between the Cat and the Fish and the songs (""Cat. Hat. In French Chat, Chapeau. In Spanish, el Gato in a Sombrero!)have obviosuly stayed with me. This video is not the one from my youth. It is a tremendous disappointment. This is simply an uninspired reading of the book accompanied by pathetic paper cut-out animation and poor vocal characterization. If you're looking for the video from your youth, caveat emptor!"
3,Mantovani minus Mantovani...,"Mantovani made his last recording in 1975. His trademark sound of cascading strings(the Mantovani sound)was featured in over 50 albumsmade for Decca(London Records), some of them hits. This Essex 3 disc edition is by a group that bills itself as the Mantovani Orchestra. The roster of songs as one can see carries through the 80s, mostly concentrating on pop standards. Though how they try the arrangers don't quite capture the mood of the original recordings with the maestro directing. Some of the elements are there like the use of accordion another Mantovani trademark. The true digital sound lacks lushness in the strings section and are placed in the distance, contradicting what he was famous for. There are many selections here that the maestro never recorded, making for a pleasant listen, but without those sweeping strings this issue can only be regarded as a shell of the original."
1,CDs dont work,"I got this book to take a brief look at it and install the cds. The CDs need a CD Key, which is not provided with the book."
3,Humorous,"Laughs, and suspense mixed just right for a quick and entertaining read. Looking forward to the next book. Go Jack"
1,A nasty little pustule of a book,"Although Jack Daniels is an appealing, witty main character, I could not help but feel that I was reading a commercial ""product"" rather than a book. The repartee between Jack and her partner is great, but the plot, the criminal, the crimes and the structure are hackneyed, formulaic, and well beyond sensationalistic.The obvious ripoff on Stephanie Plum makes me give the book a low grade.The graphic depiction of sadism makes me reject it completely.How about subtlety? How about suggestion?It is a nasty little pustule of a book.Also, as a former galley checker, the research is bad. There are places and street locations that show that Ms. Konrath doesn't own a Chicago street guide. That is just plain lazy."
4,Pay no heed to Miss Orlando,"Pay no attention to the only bad review Mr. Konrath has received concerning his debut novel Whiskey Sour. It is a well-paced thriller which grabs you from beginning to end. The female heroine is far from cliche, as her character changes in many ways by the time you reach the back page. Lieutenant Jacqueline Daniels sounds like a real person from Chicago, and obviously someone from Orlando wouldn't know about that (she should probably stick to reviewing old scripts of Miami Vice - no cliches there!) A fine debut, with many already anticipating next year's sequel!"
5,A Must Read For Mystery Fans,A fun and fast read which will terrify and amuse. A must read....so stop reading reviews and give it a try.
1,Very dark...certainly no humor!,"Reading is my favorite pastime but my favorite authors can't keep up with my voracious reading appetite. So, I am always looking for new authors. I read the blog about this book and assumed it would be light, funny and a good mystery. Wrong on all counts! The characters are not developed, the book doesn't have one funny line in the whole thing and the murders are beyond grisly! I am three quarters through and not one to put down a book until the end so I will muddle through, but the second book in this series, Bloody Mary is going to the used book store.This is one of the worst books I have ever read!"
5,A well-written story of well-known events to us Salemites,"This book is a nail-biter much in the same way that ""The Perfect Storm"" was to all of us who lived through the Blizzard of '78 and then the No-Name Storm of October 1991. Actually, it is so well-written it would be a nail-biter to anyone I would think. What I like the most is that the author makes people that I only knew about through the news stories at the time come to life. They are real, brave and you want it to have a happy ending, even though life doesn't work that way sometimes. Highly recommended."
5,as usual,Another masterpiece by Michael. Have read all of his books and have never been disapionted. would reccomend his books to any one. If you see a book by this author by it!
4,Effective at a fair price,"This is a very helpful tool for cutting your way through PVC over 1.5"". The marketed 1 5/8"" ratchet cutters can't ""cut it"" since the outer circumference of 1.5"" PC is greater than 1 5/8"". This cutter was one of the few 2.5"" cutters available for under $100, and was definitely worth it.One concern was that I had a small piece of the blade break off (about 1/8"" of the blade), but the tool was still effective, and the supplier promptly replaced for me.This cutter is something that anyone who works with PVC should definitely have in his or her workshop."
3,So-So,Tony Hawk--A great innovator and skateboarding would NOT be where it is today without him...However we could have done without his instructional video.It was a bit unclear and was less than inspiring.If you are looking for a instructional skateboarding video i HIGHLY reccommend Skateboarding Explained. You can buy it on Amazon too! Check it out!It is a step by step video that gives endless possibilities and gives you lots of new ways to invent new tricks.keep Skating!
4,Decent ring.,"Take a look at the pic I uploaded!I'm a guy and I bought this size 10 ring for myself. I've been wearing it for 2 weeks, and I like most aspect of this ring. ...As another reviewer mentioned, the downside to this ring is where it was ""welded together:"" the welds themselves are flawless, however, the dude who did the welding was kinda lazy, and s/he didn't really do a great job of trying to continue a ""Flawless Celtic Knot"" (as the ring clearly says in its' description).Pros:+ Overall ring structure is good, and the welds are all rounded and smooth!+ Very study considering how lightweight it is; it would be very difficult to deform this ring unless you intentionally forced it with a clamp...Cons:- The worker who welded the two ends of the ring together was lazy, and didn't do a precise job of keeping with the design (though I seriously doubt most people would notice it at a glance).I recommend this ring!"
1,This album is not worth buying.,"7 songs are sung by various artists and 5 are not. The orchestrations are nothing like Streisand prefers and certainly not suitable for karaoke. Try another one. This is NOT recommended - ""in the style of Barbara Streisand"" in on the cover - not her style at all, thank goodness."
5,Wonderfully engaging...,"The ""Sabrina"" score is elegant, classic, and haunting- I listen to it all of the time and it just creates a beautiful mood. I have found that the best time of year to listen to this cd is the fall because the melodies are soft and twinkle, like falling leaves. However spring and summer are also quite lovely, especially with the top down. Number thirteen is worth the money in my opinion. This is the perfect score in my collection."
1,ANOTHER SUCKY ZOMBIE MOVIE!!,"I love zombie movies! But this movie blows!!! I bought the so called "" uncut "" version, there is no blood, no plot, no action, no good acting, etc. Whatever you do DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!!!! Stick to the classics, zombie fans you know what I mean."
1,A waste of good plastic!,"I'll make this short. One of the worst movies (horror and otherwise) ever made. Obviously direct to video (cheap, no special effects). Watched it, and gave it away the first chance I had to my poor brother who is also a huge horror movie fan. Guess I just want to torment him a bit......."
1,Ilan Pape makes up his 'Facts',"Ilan Pape is an extremely unreliable 'historian'.Most of what he writes, I know from being alive at the time, did not happen the way he writes in this book."
4,Not as hostile as some think,"Unlike some of the earlier reviewers, I didn't think this was anti-Disney or anti-Celebration. After reading it, I almost wanted to move to Celebration myself! (If it had decent transit connections to Orlando it could be paradise). The authors' love for the place showed through, and the only thing that mystified me was why they left.The authors do discuss the very real problems with Celebration's schools and construction; this part of the book could have benefited from a comparison with traditional suburbs, to show readers that Celebration's problems exist in typical suburban sprawl as well -- as anyone who saw what Hurricane Andrew did to Miami's sprawl houses knows!"
5,This is the real thing!,"This is a great album from the master of the vibes. It has it all. Some beautiful sounds - 'Til Then', 'My Joy'. Some avant garde - 'Oblique' and 'Bi-Sectional'. Bobby is great, but the supporting cast is awesome. Herbie Hancock as always, is fantastic. Joe Chambers provides the drive on drums, and also contributes a couple of fine compositions - 'Oblique' and 'Bi-Sectional'. I was not familiar with Albert Stinson, the bassist, but he has a beautiful, fat sound, much like Bob Cranshaw. What a tragedy that he died shortly after this recording. And that is another thing. The recorded sound is rich and detailed. This is one of the best 'RVG' editions. I put it up there with Hank Mobley's 'Soul Station' as far as sound quality. Maybe because it was a quartet too and there is more 'space' for the individual instruments. At any rate, musically and sonically, 'Oblique' is a treasure."
1,Avoid,"This is a dog. Avoid. I was hopeful that this line up would entertain, but it's slow and weak compared to my Hutcherson favorites (The Kicker, Dialogue, Stick-up)."
4,Very swanky cd =O),"""I like this cd. The music makes me feel like I'm waking up (yes I am a morning person) to a nice warm breeze.....with rays of the sun kissing my forhead. Its a really grrrrreat!!"""
2,Nice environmental music,"First time I listened to this CD I liked a lot, but after 3 or 4 times listening to I turned it off after the second track. I think that it's some repetitive and noisy. Maybe this guys were in a rush when launching the disc."
4,Quick and efficient,"As an overview of a large amount of sculpture, this book is great. I think it would take multiple readings to get a full understanding since everything is discussed briefly. It's a perfect size to carry around instead of most art books that are about the size of textbooks."
5,Blisteringly Bluesy Appalachian Goth,"Did you ever wonder what would happen if you combined the banjo pickin' kid from Deliverance with the gothic howls and haunting lyrics of Bauhaus? Neither did I, but I found out when I first heard 16 Horsepower. The eclectic instrumentation (from electric guitar to cello to hurdy gurdy) and innovative song structures (from ballads to Delta Blues to swamp stomp) are impressive: these guys hold nothing back. Lyrically, pious religious imagery is combined with blasphemous hinting of desire and desecration. The band is from Colorado, but the inspiration seems to come from 19th century back-woods bayou porches and covered wagon treks across badlands and heartlands. 16 HP takes seemingly dichotomous themes and styles and wraps them tightly into a perfect package of what I can only describe as Appalachian Goth. It's unbelievable. It's powerful. And your toes WILL tap."
4,Very nice,"Each song on this album is at least solid, folk fun a la 16 Horsepower.Tracks 8 through 12 seemed especially strong, being rather catchy and enjoyable."
4,Great Toolkit,Haven't used every item in this toolkit but it is very handy.. only minus point is it doesnt come with a magnet - tools are all not magnetised.
3,"Pretty good, but not great","This is a fun live reggae album, but my main complaint is that the sound quality is rather poor. It sounds almost as if this is an audience recording. It's too bad the sound spoils this fun, lively energetic Yellowman performance."
3,Get Their First Album Instead,"This album doesn't measure up to the debut. The songs are just not of the same quality, that's all. The melodies are not as catchy, and nothing grabs you like ""Until I Fall Away"" or ""Hey Jealousy"" did. ""Follow You Down"" is a nice song that could have probably fit well on the first album, but there is not much else that really stands out."
4,A Marriage Only The Gin Blossoms Could Make,"In spite of what the ""critics"" have said about Congradulations...I'm Sorry, I think it's a fine CD. The marriage of country music on Memphis Time was nothing short of brilliant (even though I don't care for Country Music). While the CD may not have been as widely successful as Miserable New Experience, the boys from Tempe, Az still put together a superior effort..."
4,"Not their best, but still good","This was not their best effort,(they didn't live up to the performance they turned in on ""New Miserable Experience"", but it was still a good release. Some of the songs sounded the same. For example, ""My Car"" and ""Virginia"" were too similiar, because of the repetive rhythm. However, ""Follow You Down"" is by far one of the best songs the Gin Blossoms have ever recorded. Though not their best, it still was a good effort, particulary in the forceful guitar work."
3,Looks tougher then it performs,"The Icedozer works pretty well on flat windshields, for example my Jeep. It's performance isn't as impressive on curved windshields, it only scrapes off thin slivers of ice due to the flatness of the blade.We only got to try it twice this past winter on two different vehicles and two different conditions. The first time it performed admirably since the ice build up was thin. The ""smashing"" motion worked to create a break point and while ""dozing"" the ice crumbled and came off in sections easily.However, with the thicker ice (~3-4 mm) the smashing motion did not seem to do much and while scraping/dozing, especially on a curved windshield, the scraper did not perform any better then a standard ice scraper."
5,Foundational to true knowledge,"Looking for an answer to the problem of evil? Aquinas answers it, and more questions than most people think to ask. If you've never read Aquinas, get Kreeft's concise edition. If you're looking for a permanent reference for your library, this is the one."
1,The are multiple areas of missing text,"I looked up one questions Part III Question 2, by the time I hit the second block of missing text I gave-up and returned."
2,"Sleazy, camp Eurotrash interpretation - doesn't quite work","This Eurotrash production of the Contes d'Hoffmann almost, but not quite, pulls it off. As one would expect, the decor is ugly - lots of naked light bulbs, rotating scaffolding, man in dirty raincoats, women in stockings. The singing and music are reasonably good, but not great. But Offenbach's music is so charming that it's probably hard to destroy a score like this.Perhaps this production aimed at a genuinely sleazy, realistic interpretation of the dark side of Hoffmann, but it seems to me to have fallen short. Instead, one ends up with a rather camp production, half-way between a British Carry-On film and an am-dram play.Worth watching as an addition to better versions of Hoffmann, but don't expect too much."
4,replaced the worn item I had very well.,Item worked well and was easy to replace the worn out latch in the door.
5,JUst what I was looking for,This was the only place I could find this item for my old house. It worked out perfect. And shipped really quick.
4,John Cusack!,"I love these older goofy movies, and you don't get too much better than Better Off Dead. John Cusack is a genius in everything I have ever seen him in. He is cute, funny and just an average guy. You can relate to him and he is never dull. I really enjoy the plot to the movie because it is original and gives a different twist to a classic theme."
5,I want my two dollars!!!,"This movie is a classic! I've had it on VHS (taped from t.v.) for years and I finally had to order it on DVD. The characters are hysterical. My favorite line is the newspaper boy's constant chant, ""I want my two dollars!"" If you love teen movies, '80s movies, classic camaros, and/or moms that make scary dinners, you'll love this movie. If you're tired of dramas, the bad economy, etc. you need to watch a comedy!"
4,cusack's best teenaged movie,"Better Off Dead is a good movie and its somewhat of a not good movie at times. It has to be Cusack's best movie when he was younger, this and Say Anything. I liked how that paper boy always chased him ""2 Dollars"". so if theres a good PG movie out there that you want to watch, this is it, I recomened Better OFf Dead, its funny and insane"
1,THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,"This movie is the awful with a capital A. It's a wannabe cheeky comedy that's not funny. I adore John Cusack and see everything he appears in, but this was the worst. Hide your children, hide your eyes and take your dog for a walk..."
5,Your DVD collection is not complete without this movie!,"Better off dead one of the best teen movies ever made, a great performance by John Cusack. This is going to be a movie classic, a movie that every one should have in their collection!"
4,Soups and Stews for EVERY day!,"Soups and Stews for Fall and Winter Days contains an excellent variety of recipes -- some interesting new ones and clever variations on old favorites.Even if you are not a soup fan, it's fun to read Fosburgh's comments. As a published fiction writer, her way with words may entice you to try something new. At $10.95 per copy, the book is well worth the price for this small gem. Because I am a so-so cook, I usually like photos in a cook book. However, Soups and Stews for Fall and Winter Days is so clearly written and the cover photos so appealing, I don't miss them in this offering. I know I'll be trying some of these ideas for the fall football season."
3,Glenn Gould : A Life and Variations,"This is a well researched and well written book. It would primarily be interesting for someone who is very interested in Glenn Gould. That is, it is not for the casual reader. Parts of it are very dense, with little in the way of true drama. Nonetheless, Glenn Gould comes across as a very complex and brilliant man. One develops a compassion for him, and this makes the ending rather sad. One thing I wanted to point out that the other reviews did not was that the author was condescending and derisive at times. This was not all the time, but in parts he clearly mocks some of the things Gould did. This bothered me considerably. While one might say that the author was being balanced, it gave me a sour impression of the author. Obviously Gould had his oddities, however I don't feel Mr. Friedrich was as sympathetic as he could have been."
2,Knife marks,"I bought this cutting board a few weeks ago. I made a mistake. I used my electric knife to slice roasts on this cutting board. The board already shows knife indentations and flaking plastic on the top layer. Perhaps, this board should be saved just to dice veggies and cut fruit."
4,Does not dull my knives,"I like the many gripper ""feet"" on the bottom. This does not dull my knives, but the knives do leave slight indentations on the surface. Will get the next size smaller also."
5,Non-slip chopping board,"This is a great item, handy to use, non-slip bottom makes it a great product."
2,Disappointing,"The first book in this series ""Shadows Daughter"" was excellent, this book however is not. But it also, except for the name of the main character, has almost no relation to the first book at all. The break in characterisation and culture from the first is completely jarring. This is an action book from start to finish and Stirlings heavy hand is all over it. Not that I dislike Stirling, when he is on form he is a good writer, but this book shows him almost at his worst. It was, I think, supposed to be a collaboration with Meier, but ended up being just another Stirling battle and gore fest. As a stand alone Conan with a sex change type novel it is only bearable. As a sequel to an excellent beginning novel it is simply trashy."
3,it's an oldie but a goodie,"I have searched for this cd for a very long, it has african trilogy on it and is the reason for my buying it."
3,Not So Easy Up,"I bought these Easy Ups Trainers as the transition for my 2yo (who only weighs 26lbs) but she wasn't able to pull them up and down herself and I found them difficult myself. This resulted in frustration for both her and I. They also don't have flaps for easy removal if an accident does happen, thus, the only thing to do is to rip them. Not the easiest thing when there's a big mess and you're in a department store bathroom."
2,No so impressed,My baby loved Dora. I was very disappointed. I have used Pampers since she was born but the quality of the Easy Ups is not what I expected. I feel there are store brand training pants that are better. I would only reorder these if I could get them dirt cheap.
1,Gives my daughter a bright red butt with lines of parallel welts almost equidistant,"I think the title says it all. She had one on for two hours this morning and when I took it off, her butt had two bright red patches each about 7-8 square inches, neatly striped with thin even brighter red welts. So many thumbs down. I use Huggies for day diapers and overnights but thought I could cheap out for training purposes since these cost much less. What a mistake."
5,"Awesome name brand product, price can't be beat","The difference between Pampers and Huggies pull ups is that the Huggies have tabs that are adjustable. But if you are looking for a good pull up that your child can use Pampers fits the bill. My girls can pull them up and down without tearing them and they hold overnight wetting, too. I think they run a little small, my two year old 37 pound girl fits best in a size 5. But, I like them to have room in the easy up. The price on amazon using subscribe and save and amazon mom benefits is unbeatable."
1,Yuch. Yuch! YUCH!!! If you love your daughter do not buy these easy ups!,"These training pants reek of some disgusting fragrance. I was truly afraid to even put them on my daughter once...I did not want her to have some type of reaction/infection. I wish they would have marked the box and description ""scented"" so I could have passed on buying them. I wonder if the boys version are similarly chemically soaked? I cannot afford to find out at this point. A complete waste of money for our family."
4,Pampers Dora Easy Ups,"I found the size 4 Pampers Easy Ups to be bulky in the bottom (so not so cute with leggings as my daughter appeared to have a big saggy wet diaper). Otherwise the fit was good for my tiny-waisted daughter & she LOVES the Dora design! Oh, & I liked the baby powder scent!"
1,Horrible experience with this particular item,I have used This brand for the past two years and love this but its the first time I have purchased it from Amazon because the price was much better than the stores. What I will tell you is this is probably just a bad batch but my little girls bottom is all scrathed up from the band or material they used in this batch. I have never seen anything like this and I have used this brand like I said. I couldnt believe my eyes when I went to change her after using these. I am going to report this batch to Pampers as well because somebody needs to know how these were made. I love Amazon and buy frequently and yes I have had some issues with items but nothing like this. I will still be an avid Amazon buyer but this particular item was very disappointing to say the least.
1,Rashes,"My daughter uses Pampers Cruisers and we decided to change to Easy Ups. Sadly, she is getting rashes and always on the top part of the back of the diaper. Will not be getting this again."
2,Not so happy,I love pampers diapers but their pull up ones are not so good. Besides leaking there is no Velcro on the sides for easy off by mommy (don't want to mess with a dirty diaper like that). I really like the Huggies for the pull ups better.
1,Huggies Pull-ups are much better,"Very disappointed. Understand that these are training pants, but I have to clean up clothes and floors when she doesn't make it to the potty."
1,Beware - different design than size 4,"My daughter wore the size 4's no problem, but within 24 hours of wearing the size 5's, she had a flaming bum. Upon side by side comparison, the size 5's have an elastic strip that goes right down the middle, front to back, and whatever it is made of created a horrible allergic reaction that took 1 ped visit and 7 days to clear up. I wrote to pampers who denied that there was anything different between the 4 and 5, even though I could SEE that there was. Giving them the benefit of the doubt and wanting to recoup my $30 investment, I tried the diapers again, with the same result. After 2 years of only Pampers, we are now a Huggies household."
2,inconvenient pullups,These pullups don't have the resealable sides like Huggies or Up and Up so it is not fun changing poopy diapers. I don't plan on buying these diapers again.
3,Better than Huggies and Worse than Huggies,"Our daycare begs and pleads with us to by Huggies because they are easier to put on and take off without having to remove shoes and pants. But, Pampers are much better in terms of leak protection and don't leave weird flakes on my daughter's skin like huggies do. Why can't pampers make easy ups with tabs? I don't get it. With tabs, easy ups would receive 5 stars."
4,3T/4T is size 5 equivalent,"I like the diapers. They are soft and flexible. However, did not know 3T/4T is size 5 equivalent. I was using Size 6 for my daughter and got 3T/4T trainers. After opening I realized that it is size 5 and am left with a box of diapers which is small for her."
2,No velcro tabs to hold rolled up dirty diaper together,"I am beyond surprised that there are no Velcro tabs to hold the dirty diaper together once you've rolled it up. Throwing away open diapers will make the diaper pail smell even worse than it already does with closed up contained diapers. Would also be a pain if you can't dispose of the diaper immediately or if you're out. I am disappointed because there were a number of things I did really like. My daughter wears 3T and 4T clothes and the 3T-4T size is a perfect fit. They are soft and thick and my daughter loves the Dora print. Unfortunately, the lack of velcro tabs is a deal breaker for me. Back to the Huggies easy ups for me."
2,all around great information,"From preparing the soil, to designing the space, to collecting the harvest, and finally to using your herbs, Dorothy Morrison has covered everything. She gave me ideas for planting, composting, and crafting that I had not thought of before. Whether you are a beginning herbalist, like I am, or experienced, I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't find good ideas. I especially liked the fact that the herbal recipes were for cooking, cleaning, crafts, skin care, and other uses."
3,Worth watch,Rather a pity that Ashutosh Rana doesn't get to do movies that give his talent free reign. Sharad kapoor does a decent enough job at being menacing. The two wemen are better of modeling. Rohit can escape the guillotine if he leaves the country. See... I can be kind. The music is long and tiring even though we have Adnan Sami and Sonu Nigam giving us the earful.Message of the movie: never ever piss your milkman off. Ever. Keep quiet when he dilutes the water in your milk with some more water and you get to keep your head.
3,good toy but mine broke easy,This is a great toy for a newborn up to a yr or 2. I gave my first one away because my niece loved it too much and bought a second one for my son. The second one broke down too fast.
5,Trust me on this one,"I am really into female artists with unique voices: Harriet Wheeler (The Sundays), Mary Fahl (October Project), Karen Peris (The Innocence Mission), Karin Bergquist (Over the Rhine), Cassandra Wilson, Tracy Chapman, Joni Mitchell, Natalie Merchant, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple...If you are like me in this respect, I would strongly suggest you purchase Patty Griffin's Living With Ghosts. Flaming Red is also good, but I don't think it is AS good. Anyway-- Living With Ghosts is just such a strong representation of Patty's best work. Her voice is so powerful and her lyrics display a realism that just hits home with anyone.If you enjoy any of the female artists I mentioned above, I'm sure you would love Patty Griffin's Living With Ghosts. If you don't you can yell at me and I'll give you a refund. Ok, that's a lie. Just trust me on this one."
4,"More soul, less hesitance than in later recordings",I was really pleased when I read on the packaging that this was comprised of demo tracks. What a fabulous find for appreciating the origins of recordings for the now established singer songwriter.
4,An amazing depth of emotion in both her lyrics & her vocals.,"Patty Griffin's debut album is full of highly charged emotions. Her songs are lyrically strong and show an amazing range of experiences. Her voice is unique and fits her songs perfectly; it would be hard to imagine anyone other than Ms. Griffin singing these personal musical statements. Every song is worth listening to, but one standou - ""Every Little Bit"" - makes this album worth every penny."
3,"Don't own the CD, but I am familiar with ""Mad Mission""","I have this track on cassette, from a May 1996 New York radio show, recorded by a pal of mine. Each time I hear this song, I must sing along. In doing so, I find that my heart grows swollen and my eyes well up with tears. I'm not into schmaltz, and this does not classify as schmaltz. I can't comment on the rest of the album, I don't own it, but, I will say that Griffin got this one right on. Because I'm only familiar with the one track, I give it a 3 star rating. Based on this one track, though, I reccomend a further investigation of her offerings."
5,superior service,"I received the cd in 3 days. The product was as stated, in excellent condition plusI love the music. Thanks"
2,sardines,"The cans are impossible to open by pulling the top open, the handle is flimsy, breaks and the sharp base can cause injury. The sardines are very delicious if you can open the can with a strong can opener. I wish they came in a can that could be rolled open, the old fashioned way or had a stronger handle."
2,Great product but leaking oil,The product is great. That's not to be denied however 2 of the 12 packages were leaking oil and had to be thrown away. There is no method of contacting the distributor to get replacement. It is unfortunate considering the price per package. I won't be reordering.
4,Great kick ass breakfast,"Terrific for me as 1/2 tin plus a hard-boiled egg and fried potatoes for breakfast. A wonderful product with a great taste (derived primarily from the skins):takes a bit of getting used to(about 3-6weeks),then you'll be just fine..A great price for a marvelous product. I've come full circle re my Russian ancestry:fruit Loops to sardines in 3 generations! Sardines are best naturally smoked and in olive oil-all else is wretched...This brand is superior."
5,No problems,"I bought mine as refurbished from Compaq Factory Outlet in February 2002 and I got more than I expected for the price.Unit still works (Well, I am no longer running games or numerical computations since AMD simetimes overheats.), I am suspicous about HDD that it is preparing itself to leave soon (just sound), but what would I expect from notebook with such parameters and price?I use it frequently both as home computer as well as mobile notebook for presentations, sharing pictures, music playing etc. I have never played DVDs, but at least for the first year I used it for numerical computations using its full power."
1,My 700 is junk too!!!,"Overheats continuously in 10 minutes - Compaq knows about this pervasive problem and just wants it to go away with time. They refuse to do anything to help owners, and hide behind the expired warranty. Please do not buy any Compaq products and never do business with them again. If you are in IT, then please do everything in your power to pull major Compaq contracts, and support bids by IBM and Dell so that we can put this horrible company out of business."
5,Smooth and Quiet,These tires are very quiet on my Emotion rollers. I can listen to and now hear the TV while I ride ride. I don't know about durability since I just got them.
3,Recommended to Oxbridge-philes,"Dated, set in the 1990s, but a pleasure to read if you love the Oxford/Cambridge scene and wondered what it would be like to step out of the American experience and see the other side."
2,tedious,"This is a tedious, preachy book that has thinly drawn, boring characters. Men, especially unmarried men with no children, do not give another man props for being a good house-husband. Every time we meet Anna she's working and pumping her breast milk. OK, we got the point the first time that she's a working mom. It does not work to pretend the mainstream press is ignoring severe weather changes; and the only ones in the know are the scientists at NSF, who never talk about it directly, just post interesting news stories in the break room so they can complain about it. More than helf the book is the set-up, when will the plot actually unfold?"
4,Forty Signs of Rain,"I purchased this for a reading group that was assigned the topic, ""Global Warming"". It is an interesting take on what the author sees as possible damage from global warming in a few years time. As I understand it, the book is the first of a series of three books. I think I'll see if the library has the next one."
2,very preachy,"I thouroughly enjoyed the ""Mars"" triology. The character development, the interplay between characters with different viewpoints and differing goals, all set in a sci-fi backdrop.Too bad there isn't any of that here. The entire novel seems to preach about a socially liberal fantasy world. I just can't tell if it is a nightmare or Utopia.In the end I just didn't care about any of the characters or the situations they were in. Even though most of the book, as the first of a trilogy, is given to character development I still couldn't connect with them. Maybe this should be called caricature deveolpment instead.I might check out the second book from the library, but I won't buy it."
2,"Grind one axe at a time, please...","KSR should follow the example of John Brunner and provide some focus for his work. Given the title and author, I was prepared for a ""true believer's"" stance on global warming; but the book dawdles because Robinson has made it a bully pulpit from which to bludgeon the poor reader with homilies on Utopian Socialism, Marxian economic theory, Gouldian evolution-as-surrogate-religion, and - in a cameo cliché - the Dali-Lama.The deliberate pacing and protracted realism may not appeal to many readers, but are not unreasonable for a trilogy. KSR is clearly a gifted wordsmith, and manages to find room between his Jeremiads to develop at least some of the characters. We can only hope for more story and less sermonizing in the remainder of this opus.In the interim, for a delightful tongue-in-cheek contrast, try ""Fallen Angels"" by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Michael Flynn."
4,Wonderful for Singles Groups Bible Studies,"As a leader of a young adults group in a Catholic Parish, I am always on the lookout for good material to use. We have an ongoing Scripture Study group that meets and this will be a great study for our Summer Session. I like the way the Mr. McNutt has applied the singles whose lives are told in the Bible to our life as singles today. I never would have thought about some of the people he mentions as being ideal examples for our lives as single Christians today. I also appreciated The Second Mile (the questions at the end of each chapter)."
1,It's not for NOKIA 2760,"It said that works with Nokia 2760, but it doesn't wor, the ends are too big and the Nokia 2760 plug is very tinny. Wasn't useful at all :("
3,the misses tainted this film for me,"Surprisingly, the best vignette was the last one that didn't seem very promising at the outset because of the preceding problematic offerings but turned out just sweet and lovely and gave the film such a lift like the last runner in the relay race who makes up for the lags made by other team members."
2,"Paris, not so good","I rented this film because of the rave reviews I read on the Internet. I usually like these types of films, but this was a failure. The film consists of several separate and very different stories revolving around the city of Paris. Although a few of the stories are compelling and interesting, overall they are pointless, banal, and uninspired. The only redeeming quality of this film is in the end where a character from one story is connected to a character from another story. Even this concept fails as there are more than a dozen stories and only about half of those at best are connected in the end. Pointless, and worst of all, boring."
1,Ruined Blu-Ray Version,"This is THE WORST Blu-Ray transfer I have seen yet, merely because there are only Subtitles for The Hard Of Hearing, which destroy the film.The most glaring offense is the mime scene, which has subtitles!Simply beautiful movie - simply ruined."
3,J T aime,A very significant cultural overview of the paritian life and people. The visual images make you fill that you are really walking on the streets and neiborhoods of Paris.
1,Lazy and incoherent mess,"What a disappointment. The world's most distinguished city represented in 18 vignettes that lack even the semblance of a script. Steve Buscemi could've been assaulted on the DC Metro for all the 'effort"" that the Coen Brothers put into writing this vignette for the Paris Metro. Bob Hoskins and Ben Gazzara were scripted and acted like zombie extras from ""Shaun of the Dead"". Why precisely was Gerard Depardieu talking about crabs on a dinner menu when Ben Gazzara was just having a drink? NO continuity QC?An incoherent, disgraceful mess - worse than Altman's pretentious and equally lazy ""Pret a Porter"". Does nothing to eulogize Paris - the acting and the sense of Paris in ""Ratatouille"" were far superior - as, in fact, was Remy's acting. Perhaps actors and directors are lulled into a sense that with Paris as a background, there's no need to practice their trade. A waste of time and money."
4,Interesting and Different Movie. Nice dvd package,"If you're a romantic AND you love moviesyou'll like this movieit's 14 shorts of 7 minutes eacheach with a different cast and director and writer14 visions of lovesome great, some nice, some BADit's a mixed bag but a nice bag nonetheless.the dvd is full of nice extras, although if you are not sure, i recommend purchasing the single dvd edition, it's much cheaper."
1,Didn't do so great with my camelback,"I removed the mouthpiece from the quick-disconnect on my camel back...attached the male end to my Katadyn filter hose and pluged it in to the female quick disconnect on my camelback...as I pumped the water filter all it did was shoot water out around the quick-disconnect it was not flowing into the camelback. It might work with other systems, but it didn' do so geat with the camel back."
5,Formosa Betrayed,"Along with oral history from family and friends involved in the incident, this book is one of the two best sources which clarified to me that Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is China. An excellent account of the 228 Incident, one of many ""forgotten Holocausts"", with extensive research and clear writing that shows the source of today's confusion over Taiwan's international status.Also a very good source for showing how much damage a foreign government that does not care for its people can do; a classic story of corruption and cover-up."
4,C2G 11 Piece Computer Tool Kit,I personally have had this starter tool kit since the mid-90s and for it has served me well as I have added other computer building tools over the years. Got this for my children as they both our out on their own and followed in their Dad's footsteps and maintain/build their own systems for both competitive gaming and work.This is a great starter kit to maintain modern PCs or MACs...
3,Proof reading is key!,"I have gotten a lot out of this book. It has solid suggestions and the advice given is useful. However, perhaps the author might want to proof his own work, especially the cover. The sub title on the book, and it is viewable on the 'see larger photo' of jacket on this page, is 'How smart Restaurateurs' are using newsletters to build business' I would rather be a restauRANTeur than a restauRATeur!"
2,Not pleased,We used this product for about a week and it was working well and correcting our dog from jumping on the counters. Then we noticed it wasn't producing a shock. We figured it was the battery so we replaced it. Now we know it was the unit. It only produces a static shock on high setting. That setting is reduced from the original high setting.We are very disappointed because this product was expensive for the amount of use we got out of it.
1,My cat will take the pain and walk on it..,"The ScatMat would probably work for a normal animal, but it doesn't keep my cat from walking on it to get out the doggie door. I do have it turned up as high as it will go so he gets the maximum. He walks on the ScatMat and just kind of hops around on it taking the shocks and then jumps out the doggie door. Since I don't have a normal cat, I am going to have to return this product."
5,FINALLY can keep my cats off our cars.,"This works. After years of dealing with cats sleeping on our cars, scratching and making the hoods dirty from their paws, bought this and it is now a deterrent. After a month using, no need to even turn it on. I tested it on low myself and it is like a heavy static shock. Highly recommend to keep a cat off of just about anything."
1,Seriously?,"Excited to work with this mat, I placed it on my desk, where my cats go. Of course I have my computer there, along with the mouse, mouse pad, bills folder, etc. Upon turning it on, it sat there and blinked the activity indicator until I shut it off. I removed everything from my desk including the mat. Checked the snap connections on the battery pack (which the feet of the pack did not fit the cutouts on the plastic mat (small yes I know, but for $60 it should come close)). I placed the mat alone on the table with nothing on it. It blinked non stop saying activity. I set the mat on the floor and it was okay for about 2 minutes, when me walking around it set it off, indicating activity. I placed it on the table again (this is a plastic top table, no rivets, studs, metal of any kind) and it just blinked the activity light. It was a frustrating event considering the reviews others have given. Wished I knew how sensitive it was."
2,Not effective for 6 mo old Kitten,"The first time we tried to use the mat was to keep a 6 month old kitten out of a room and he was able to sneak around it in the corner. The we tried again by putting the mat inside the room in the doorway. 2 times he walked right over it and nothing happened. Then one time he jumped over and another time he got shocked but instead of backing out, he ran in!!!! This product definately didn't work for us. I can see where it might work better for dogs."
2,Maybe great but can't use,Received this but the ScatMat Power Adapter doesn't work with it! Amazon did send me a label to return the products but what a waste of time!
1,Cruel Training,I bought the ScatMat to keep my cats off of the kitchen counter. The description said that the shock was the equivalent of a static shock. They recommend touching the mat to check it and when I did...OUCH! It was painful on the very lowest setting. My husband tried it too and agreed with me that it was too painful to use on our cats. Not only did I not want my cats to use it but I was afraid of accidentally touching it while it was on. I recommend finding a more humane training solution.
2,Only works for stupid cats.,"I thought this would be a great idea for my cat who loves to climb all over surfaces where she's not allowed. And it's true that she doesn't like to step on it. On the other hand, my cat quickly learned to avoid the mat itself rather than whatever surface it happened to be on. So if I put the mat on the kitchen counter, she'll stay off the kitchen counter--but if I move it to the dining room table, she'll recognize that it's no longer on the counter and she'll be all over the counter. In other words, in order for this product to be effective, I would have to have one covering every single area where I didn't want my cat and leave them there 24/7. Cats are pretty smart, and I have a hard time believing that most wouldn't recognize that the mat itself is the thing they need to avoid rather than the surface where the mat is sitting."
2,scat mat,"This product worked well for a short period of time. When it ceased to work about 8 weeks later, close exam showed a wire pulled loose, and broken. No children here, and one escape artist cat. Nothing to catch the wire, I assume the wire was too close to surface, as the wires are about the thickness of a human hair. Disappointed in short survival."
2,Doesn't emit sound like the older versions,"I have an older version of the scatmat from PetSafe that I bought about 2 years ago. It had a smaller sized controller and it allowed you the option of emitting a loud beep either along with shock or on it's own. I've found that the sound alone has been enough to deter my cats from touching the mat and sends them scurrying. And if that didn't work, I had the option to turn on shock mode. So it's a step in the wrong direction by this manufacturer IMO. I'm returning mine."
3,Good help,but where are the color pictures. Many of the illustrations comment on differences that can only be viewed in color but all are in black and white. This I will never understand.
3,Just not the same CeCe that made such a lasting impression a couple of years before,"Not that this album is by any means horrible, but here CeCe decided to be a more straight-up soul singer instead of the neo-disco diva that most people know and love her as. Her singing skills haven't gotten any worse, but this just doesn't knock you out the way that ""Finally"" and ""Thought Ya Knew"" do."
2,Not a cookbook,"If you have much experience developing CBTs or multimedia projects, this isn't the resource for you. It's better for aspiring managers or managers of training depts. It's a good book to read if you want to know a whole lot ABOUT the field of WBT. The CD-ROM is not a model of good design. It provides a list of URLs but does not categorize the list. Unless you're very familiar with the training world, you don't know which are links to resources (most aren't) and which aren't. The NASA link takes you to a login page for NASA employees and contractors (I assume most of us are not either of these). All in all, I regret buying the book. It does have useful information and interesting asides, but I did not use it in developing my department or WBT strategy."
1,Worst book for learning this material,"If you want to learn chemical engineering tranfer and unit ops, this is NOT the book. The subject matter is complex to begin with and coupling this with a difficult text and non-stop equations, constants, and symbols, further compounds the difficulty in learning this material. Nothing is explained, so a firm understanding of heat transfer and fluid flow is needed from the onset. Examples of problems are given, but steps are skipped, and it is hard to follow how the solutions are obtained. If this is a required text for your course, be prepared for a long, long semester!"
4,"""Mr. White Sox""","Here we have the autobiography of Minnie Minoso. Minnie was the first dark skinned Latino to play Major League Baseball and was one of the most popular Chicago White Sox of all time. Minnie comes across as a true gentleman in this book, as he relates the story of his life in and out of baseball. He doesn't have an axe to grind, although he is honest about people who he feels have slighted him. A good read about one of the true good guys in baseball."
4,Superior concert capture,"All the artists do great to near great, except for Little Richard, who, strangely delivers a cookin' but ultimately short and sweet Great Gosh A-Mighty. Fans please note that on an oveseas edition, Richard has *three* songs: Joy, Joy, Joy; (There's) No Place Like Home; Great Gosh A-Mighty. Travis Wammack, from his band at the time, plays lead - the original Swamp Rocker.Ray Charles is magnificent, doing The Mess Around, which we assume was not on his setlist in 1988.Bo Diddley does his thing and is predictably terrific.Jerry Lee Lewis gets a little giddy but rocks up a storm.(No chicks in the crowd. jk. were they there?)."
1,DOES NOT WORK,I GOT EVEN THE REPLACEMENT BUT EVEN THAT DOES NOT WORKI HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND SOFAR.WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,Watch didn't work,"We ended up returning this beautiful watch because it didn't work. We took it to a battery store to see if it needed a new battery and the manager said, ""Oh, a Skagen watch. I won't dare touch it because they open in a special way and I could scratch it."" So rather than risk scratching it and finding out that it wasn't a battery problem but that it was defective, discouraged us from pursuing this matter further and so we simply returned it. I don't think I would order another Skagen watch again. We did return it to Amazon."
5,"If you are too lazy to help yourself, well...","...no book will be good enough for ya. If you are ready to be guided with love and humor into exploring yourself in useful ways, GET THIS BOOK and GET TO WORK! You'll love it! Practical ways to get to the answers inside us, the Big Ones such as what do we really want in this lifetime? What must be given up so you can move forward (it's different for everyone.) It is a practical step-by-step, ""keep you from fooling yourself"" kind of guide.And did I mention it is fun?Consider also, ""You Can't Afford The Luxury of a Negative Thought""...a book that has helped my husband (among many others) tackle his depression sans pharmaceuticals (after 48 years of major struggle) AND become an active participant in his own life! He is happier than he has ever been in his life, and that makes my world a lot better, too."
5,THIS BOOK MADE ME SAD,"I'm really sad that I didn't pay closer attention to my son when he said, ""Do you remember when I was big and you were little?"" or when my father insisted that my daughter was his (departed) mother come back. For parents who still have little ones at home and are willing to listen to them, this could be the gateway to a whole 'nother way of looking at the world, at life, at purpose. Carol Bowman does a beautiful job telling the stories of families come back together. If there is one persistent message in the book, it is ""listen to your kids...let them tell their stories"". It's just too bad that the book reads so smoothly and BLAM, then you're done and you wish it would keep going."
2,Feels So Bland,"Chuck Mangione does play a pleasant trumpet.And the songs on this collectiona re reasonably soothing as background music. However, in Chuck's form of Jazz, there is very little pizazz. Like lets say Herb Alpert per se. Occasionally Chuck adds an inflection in his trumpet playing style but for the most part he toots along quite softly.The songs are kind of bland with a few interesting melodies but nothing that grabs and shakes you. The band of musicians on this compilation rarely distinguish themselves. A good guitar solo on Feels So Good and a few slick arrangements on Fun And Games and Belavia. Otherwise, the band just does not break out into anything special.All in all, I'll pass on this compilation."
3,Two specific videos and a map; not an overview,"I bought this video looking for an overview of Australia. However, this video is actually three very specific items: ""Australia's Great Barrier Reef"" video (60 mins); ""Australia's Kangaroos"" video (60 mins); and a fold-out map of Australia. A nice compilation of some interesting video, but not an overview."
5,Excelente libro,Soy una terapista y recomiendo este libro muchisimo. Es un libro que puede ayudarle a comenzar su transformacion personal hacia una vida mas positiva y alegre.
1,Be Aware,"I purchased this graphic card with the hope that it canfunction with my 3 years old PC which runs on Win98SE.The card was nothing but trouble. First, some of DLL aremissing. Second, it locked up my Window at the startup. Attempt to contact Best Data via e-mail has notbeen successful and I am still waiting for their reply.I have dual boot capability for MS Window and Suse Linus 8.2.Linux did recognize the card and it had driver for normalsetup. But, for 3D graphic capability I was referred to Nvidiaweb site which had no driver for it. I am very disappointedand I decided never purchace any Nvidia graphic cards."
3,New? Battery Potency,Battery supposed to have 50% more life than the original but it seems to have a little less. Low price probably still makes it worthwhile.
5,A Great Book for a Non-Academic,"Along with Paul Wilmott's books, I used this book to solidify my understanding of derivatives pricing. This book is accessible to those with elementary calculus and probability college courses.A must-have for those who want to understand the nuts-and-bolts of math behind derivatives pricing."
5,una,"I travel internationally a few times a year and do my own travel plan of such areas. So far,this map is the most detailed for land/car travel that I've used."
4,Almost 5 stars,"I discovered BT years ago on Late Night with David Letterman. The first song I ever heard them play was ""Believe Me"" off of ""Save His Soul."" It is my favorite BT track,and is MISSING off this otherwise excellent CD. Loose, jangly, and fun, but incomplete."
5,This CD is the best out of a fabulos collection of hit from,"This cd is awsome it fully displays the talents of John Popper and his crew . It demonstrates why Blues Traveler is ""jammin"" band they will perform any time any where they improvise at a blink of an eye. Making 3 minute songs go for 15 minutes making solos and diffrent melodys while they play. If you are unsure about the band listen to this cd and you will fall in love with it ."
2,"Harry, who picks your songs?","I have been a Harry Connick Jr. fan since day one but if he keeps making albums like the last 3 or 4 I quit! Harry, please more like ""When Harry met Sally."""
3,It's ok,The CD was actually ok for his style of music. He doesn't have all that great of a sense of rhythm.... The songs are great classics so.... that is the good part.-Lucy-
4,Charming & Refreshing,"This is my first Harry Connick CD. If you are new to Harry like me, than this CD seems like a terrific introduction. You'll feel comfortable enough with the songs (you'd be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't heard all these songs before) to focus on, and enjoy, his artistic decisions. I was impressed with his touching 'Something Was Missing', the sonically sophiscated ""Oompa Loompa"", the acting put into 'I Want it Now' and the pure fun of 'The Lonely Goatheard' and 'The Jitterbug' (a song which has never worked for me until now). I've listened through this collection a few times and it's got me realy interested to hear his original works. I just might become a Harrry Connick fan! What better complement can you give a CD?Harry's 'Pure Imagination/Candy Man' medley neatly sums up the entire collection for me. Who can take a beloved song and turn it into something new? Harry Connick can."
5,The Best Harry Connick Jr. Album Of ALL TIME,"This album is FANTASTIC. Take some great classic songs from great classic movies, add a little jazz and toss in Harry Connick Jr. and you've got a fantastic album. Harry Connick is a genius. He took these songs and re-did them adding a little jazz flavor while maintaining the integrity of the songs themselves. It's great that someone is remembering these great songs, and bringing them out again in a slightly different fashion. This is a ""make you feel good"" album. GET THIS!!!!"
3,Impossible Places,I found the service I received from the seller to be prompt and accurate. If the seller were to offer other merchandise that I wanted I would certainly be inclined to purchase from them.
5,In the chorus line!,"We're doing a shortened version at my summer camp, and I honestly adore the remastered version. I love all the songs equally, though What I Did For Love is especially great, and I know Sing! by heart, since that's what I'm supposed to sing in our version ;)"
5,Wonderful recording of a wonderful show.,"What can I say? A high-quality recording of a high-quality show, with a high-quality cast! If you like ACL, this CD is probably already in your collection - if you're new to ACL this is the perfect place to start. My only complaint is that they cut some of the songs, but enough is left for the listener to get the message of the piece and feel the emotions that ACL is known for. I would recommend this recording to any musical theatre fan."
4,Here comes the Wiz!,"David Springett has brought together a set of clear, step by step instructions to build jigs that make the unthinkable thinkable, and the impossible possible. If you are interested in lattice turning, spheres, Chinese balls and rings, interlocking spheres, and many other mind blowing turnings, then this book is a must read. The most amazing project is the turned box inside a sphere.The projects are step by step and fully illustrated with clear well taken photograps. Springett also includes clear instructions on how to make the tools needed to make the lattice cuts and undercuts needed with the various spherical turnings."
1,CHEAP LASTED TWO WEEKS,"WHEN INSTALLING THIS HEATER IN A SIDEKICK BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU CUT THE LOWER RADIATOR HOSE THRE IS NO CLEARANCE FOR A CLEAN INSTALL.THE ELEMENT FAILED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF USE. THIS IS A CHEAP MADE IN CHINA PRODUCT, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,Absolutely...I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!,"I've hardly come across any amazing concert DVD's, but this meets the standards of awesomeness. The quality is so SO good, I can watch it over and over and still have my pants wet. This is a definite buy for ANYONE, whether or not Godsmack is your favourite band, this is an amazingly SWEET and a steal! With this type of WICKED material, the price is ripping GODSMACK off!! BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THE LEAST!!"
4,Very enjoyable album of his hits...all top notch,Frampton has been lost from the generation of the 90's and beyond and hopefully this will showcase his talents with the guitar and his arranging..
4,Good Compilation,"I purchased this CD-ROM to get some of the songs I wanted. I wish I had ordered a different CD now like Peter Frampton Live. After I ripped the CD using Windows Media Player, all of the information was in Japanese??? I believe this is a problem with Microsoft Windows Media, and not the CD-ROM because I downloaded MediaMonkey and it ripped the music correctly. If you like Peter Frampton and don't have any of his music this is an okay CD but I'd look at the other releases as well first before purchasing."
4,Studio versions are needed,"Doesn't everybody in the world already have ""Frampton Comes Alive"" ? I do,so why do they have to use the live versions of his songs on the greatest hits packages ? Tracks 1,6 & 14 are from the live album. His Frampton's Camel record had a nice tight rockin' version of ""Do You Feel Like We Do"" and the other two are from his 1975 self-titled record.On this greatest hits cd they are live. Enough already! Please just re-release all of his original albums."
2,Lovely Image but Stupid Story,"Check out the history of the Yellow Submarine project and I believe it's not too closely linked to the minds of the Beatles. Better off with just getting the tunes; Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, etc. The gems are the songs, not the story. Even my 6 year-old is not that engaged in this silly, nonsensical, almost insultingly stupid story."
5,Perfect for God's children of all ages,I bought this as a prayer book for my 3 1/2 year old and I love reading it. It has so many beautiful scriptures and pictures. We all could learn from the way children love Our Lord and this book reminds us of that.
1,"Don't buy it! Not as pictured, doesn't work as stated.","First, what you get does not match their picture. No fancy profile on the washer, just an ordinary O-ring on a shoulder bolt. Guess they decided to cut costs. I just tried these out on a clients house and had to go back to the traditional type faucet washer, as these caused a pronounced water hammer, and converted the faucet to an ""on-off"" function, ie. no adjustment for flow rate. As soon as water began to flow, it was at maximum. When shut off, the water stopped instantly instead of gradually, which caused the water hammer. These things are a COMPLETE waste of time and money."
4,But Not Just Irishmen,"Patrick Hogan's book is an excellent insight into the North American invasion of Mexico. Although not particularly well written, it does get the message across extremely well. However, as a Scot living in Mexico, and one who has read the book, visited the memorial plaque in San Angel and the ex-convent at Churubusco and will attend the memorial service at San Angel in September,I feel that potential readers should be aware that not only Irishmen fought and died in the St Patrick's Batallion. One look at the names on the memorial plaque should get that message across - it was a multinational force made up predominantly, but not solely, of Irishmen."
3,At least 8 really solid tracks.....,"which is enough to make a really good album, but included are also a few mediocre ones and a couple horrible ones, reminiscent of the only not-awesome track on the classic Superunkown, ""kickstand"". Twas just a little editing needed. This is really 3 and 1/2 stars and definitely worth the purchase, I just get annoyed but they weak tracks that break the flow. It's got a different sound than Superunkown as mentioned by others, which takes repeated listens/getting use to, but it's great just as well. Try tracks 2,3, and 4 to get a feel for it, assuming you've heard the great, radio played Pretty"" Noose"", ""Burden"", and ""Blow up..."" My fav track though has to be ""tighter and tighter."" incredible"
5,Buy Your Own Copy!,"A friend of mine from AZ told me that I needed to buy this Cd, so I did. One of the best Cd purchases I have ever made. I have let a lot of my friends and family listen to or borrow my copy and everybody has their own favorite. I have had a hard time getting it back from some people so I've been telling them to buy their own copy! It's very versatile, there's something for everybody. I just hope that the band is able to come to Chicago soon, so I can see them live."
2,Disappointment.,"I hate anything that goes in my ear. I don't like ear buds, I don't like those gel things. I don't like this Nokia either. It really hurts. I'm really annoyed that the cell phone industry is completely ignoring the need for people who don't like things in their ears.If I connect the strap to the Nokia, then it won't stay in my ear. I need the strap off for that."
3,small dials,"This slender and stylish watch is easy to set and comfortable to wear. The smaller month, and day dials are so small it is difficult to read them and almost useless, except as a design feature."
4,first time is the charm,"this is a good greatest hits cd , lots of hits which is the way it should be and plus some other song s which maybe could of been hits or just hits with the fans. theres were a couple songs I would of left off but over all this is very good and clean. he is without one of the best performers of our time and his songs and cds will be around for a long time and if you want to get started with just one cd than this would be the one to give you what joe jackson has to offer you get about 3 songs from all his cds .its a cd you can play anytime ,party ,dinner , or just in the car!! Im becoming a fan and you will to after you buy this cd."
1,don't bother with this!,"I wish I had thought to look here on amazon.com for reviews of this product, before I wasted almost $32 buying it!! It is useless for me! It freezes up on my PDA. The maps don't open at all for me on my PDA, so I can't say how it would be if it worked. Well, that's not totally true. I ran the GPS simulator on my PC, and that looked like it would have been really neat. Unfortunately I opened the package,so I can't even return it for a refund. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option on amazon!!"
3,Good addition,"This case is quality (the name tells the story), it is a great addition for large ext. devices- good to hold cables, etc. but not big enough for a CD."
4,Great case for my seagate portable drive (freeagent goflex)...,Great case... sturdy and nice size.. my drive in particular (111x83x14.5mm) is a little bit smaller so I could fit some more cables or whatnot...I have dropped it one or two times and my drive works as new...Really recommend it...
5,Nice Case,I bought this case for a WD 2TB for mac passport and it works perfectly. It is a little bigger than the hard drive but the inside strap helps keep it in place. It is a sturdy case that will protect your hard drive no matter what. Totally worth buying!
1,Too small for Hard drive!,"Really??? I bought this case for the Seagate hard drive but it was just a little too small for the drive! On line, it looks a lot like a Case Logic case I already own (that my second, identical hard drive is in) but the case that shipped was actually smaller and I had to return it. What was Case Logic thinking when they shrunk the case, and why did Amazon recommend this case to be paired with the Seagate Free Agent Go for Mac when it doesn't fit in the case? The photo of the inside of the case even features a hard drive that looks like the Seagate Free Agent! Thanks for wasting my time. From now on, I buy cases in person with my hard drives in hand. Sorry Amazon, you blew this one. At least the return was fairly easy and I got my refund about a month later."
2,niice case but pricey .,Nice case but pricey I found it for three bucks cheaper at my local Staples store.
1,Dissatified,The case was illustrated to fit the hard drive I had purchased. The case was too small. Have no use for the case. Your computer was miostaken as presenting this case as a fit for the Iomega drive. Cost not sufficient to spend the time to return this.J Patrick Pinho
3,case for Seagate GoFlex Wireless storage,"Case is ok.not enough room for the everthing. Good protection though,just wish it was bigger. The price was good and shipping fast"
3,"Nice Case, but a little too big for my WD Passport","The case is nice looking, good quality, and offers good protection. My only complaint is that it's a bit too big for my WD Passport 120GB. I have to wrap the WD Passport in a small cloth to keep it from bouncing around in the case."
3,Inexpensive and met my needs.,"Not a lot to say on this product--I normally don't give a lot of thought to accessories. I will say it was easy to find, its cost was very reasonable, and it does what I bought it to do. No problems.Case Logic Compact Portable Hard Drive Case (Black)"
5,"Compact, Light, Durable","Had this for about 2+ years now, I think. Traveled across the oceans & I never have to worry if my HDD is ok. In fact, its in good condition. Case Logic continues to satisfy me in their product quality."
4,great cover,"this litte case is great, it is slightly hard and has plenty of space to hold the external hard drive."
5,still have it after many years,"Never had a problem with it, fits great for the small Seagate Drive I bought it for. sturdy and compact. would buy again"
4,Case Logic: Practical Even if It's not Stylish,"TheSmall External HD Case Blackis a little bulky, and the interior netting for the USB cable isn't very thick, so be sure to place yourWestern Digital 160 GB USB 2.0 Passport 2.5"" External Hard Drive ( WDXMS1600TN )upside down to avoid any scratches on its glossy finish. The stiff case provides good protection against any jostling, and holds up to the weight of any books or your laptop that might end up on top. Can't say much for the aesthetics of it, but Case Logic has always found a decent balance between function and form, and this provides much better protection than Western Digital's own neoprene wallet."
4,nice case for Seagate portable drive,I needed to purchase a separate case for my new 500 gb portable hard drive since Seagate did not provide with purchase. This works fine with small pouch for usb cord. does the job
1,Size of Case Mis-stated,"CaseLogic advertises this as 'Fits devices: 6"" x 3.75"" x 1.25""' with a 'Size: 6.25"" x 4.5"" x 1.7""' on their website. This is quite an error. We purchased one from Amazon.com but the interior space is only 5.3"" x 3.4"". So our hard drive did not quite fit. Since this is a hard case, that made the case useless for us. So be warned about this error on the CaseLogic website. Amazon.com kindly refunded our money.Later addition: Amazon.com does sell hard case that fits larger portable hard drives and also has the exact inside dimensions advertised on their website. This is theACI HandStands 16804 - Hard case for GPS / hard disk drive / camera - bluewhich you will see I rated with five stars."
5,Case Logic Review,"Having just purchased a Western Digital (WD) Passport external hard drive (60 GB, Silver Metal Case), I went to the WD web site to see if they sold a case. Unfortunately, WD no longer sells the case for this specific drive. I found this Case Logic case on the Amazon web site and the hard drive fits perfectly in the case. The web net that secures the USB cable inside the case is great. Overall, this is the perfect case for this model of hard drive and its USB cable."
1,wrong size,"This case was recommended for the hard drive purchased, however it did not fit! So I gave it to a friend with a different brand."
3,Good protection but too bulky!,"The title pretty much describes my opinion of this case. While offering great protection for the hard drive, it defeats the purpose of having compact, portable drives. It wouldn't even fit in the pocket of my laptop case and because of that I couldn't use it and had to go back to the soft case for my drive."
3,Doesn't fit,"I bought this item because it was paired with the Seagate Expansion 1TB Ext. Hard drive. It is too small for the hard drive.I give the case 3 stars only because it appears to be a well made unit, but in my case it is useless. If I return it Amazon will charge me a return fee almost the value of the case. Not worth buying for this application.Don't buy for Seagate Expansion Drive #ST910004EXA101-RK"
3,Case looks good but threads are out at few places,Case quality looks good but the threads at some inner places looks to have worn out.Rating it as a good product even though.
4,Great product.,This keeps my portable hard drive protected at all times. I would recommend this product. And it was a great price.
4,I Brought 2 of them.,Its a case not much else to say besides it fits well and seems well made. I have two of them.
3,Fits my Seagate Expansion Drive,So I purchased this for my new Seagate Expansion 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive. The drive fits but my one issues its the lack of internal padding of any kind. Its got enough room on the other side with the mesh pocket to hold my digital camera and the USB cables for the External Drive.Over all good product.
3,Blue doesn't fit my lacie external drive but black does,"I already have the black case for my other lacie drive and love it. But when I recently purchased another lacie hard drive, I purchased the blue case from this listing and it is way too small for my drive. It's a nice case and very rugged but if it doesn't fit, then oh well. The blue is a pretty color and is just as pictured."
5,Iam ok with this product with the price. (Would have decreased the shipping cost ),"The product is good .but the shipping price would have been less, so that i would have got the product for my expectede price."
1,DOES NOT FIT SEAGATE EXPANSION,"This case seems really solid and I'm sure that it works well with other HDs, but it does NOT work with the Seagate Expansion Portable drive (I got the 1TB version) even though it is paired with the Seagate on the HDs amazon page."
2,Very basic,"I bought two cases for some WD Passports that I own. They are hard cases -- no padding whatsoever. They're also slightly too large for my drive and have no way to compensate (stretching, padding). Basically, they let you keep water off your drive while in transit. I'm thinking a couple of wool socks or gloves would do a better job at shock absorption! (Heck, you could couple that with a ziplock baggie and save yourself the $13!)"
5,"Great case, great service","Searching for a gift for my daughter, I found this great option to protect a portable USB hard disk. My daugther is very happy and confident that the case will protect her precious information. I recommend it !"
5,Great little case!,"I am storing my Western Digital portable hard drive (and cord) in this and so far, so good! It fits perfect and I can rest assured knowing it is safe and sound in this hard case."
4,Maybe I'm being over generous but...,"Maybe I'm being over generous but I have 3 small 500GB Western Digital external hard drives (one for work, one for home stuff and one for other stuff) and would always use this case. People complain that it's too big for modern day drives. Maybe it is (in fact it probably is). There's a distance of maybe a thumb's width at the end of the hard drive, but unless you stand there rattling the container (and I mean really shaking it) you won't damage the hard drive. I've carried my drives in these containers all over the world. I've been to Poland, the US and China for work with them and they have protected the drive just fine.Just don't use it as a football with the drive inside."
5,Best Hard Drive Case I've Had in a While,"Excellent, no complains, protects my Seagate Freeagent Go day and night. If you're looking for a cheap protective case, look no further than this. The little pocket inside is excellent; I keep my USB cord for the drive there, so its always available whenever I need it. And the strap is very secure. All in all, probably top 5 portable hard drive cases on the market now."
3,Case too big for Toshiba 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive HDDR500E03X (Black/White),If you own the Toshiba 500 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive HDDR500E03X (Black/White) and need a case this may not be what you're looking for in terms of size. The suggestion was horrible. It's way bigger than I would like it to be. I was hoping for a more snug fit for the hard drive.
5,pretty nice,I'm more impressed with this little case than I thought I would be! Its hard-covered so the device is protected. The device fits perfectly. There's enough 'storage space' for the cable. Very happy with this purchase.
2,Joan is a Capitalist on this venue!!!,"Although not Joans biggest fan, none the less, I am a fan. The mix on this album is off center and choppy. A few good songs but they don't flow like they should on a circuit. Joan is better on MP player as you can glean the arrangements. her studio cuts are far superior to these half and halves (live and studio). Only C.D. I've not been satisfied with in a long time."
3,Worth having if you're a big fan,"This album is okay. It is a decent representation of her later work. There are a couple of absolutely stellar cuts, but the album as a whole is just okay. I think it would really satisfy you if you are an ardent fan of her work."
4,A cute movie,"I'd never read the novel, but rentedBallet Shoesfor my wife. We liked it. It's a cute movie about three girls growing up and finding out what's really important to them. Each of the three girls goes through a pretty substantial transformation and all have to resolve underlying insecurities. The acting was pretty strong, especially given the age of the actresses in real life. Unfortunately, the movie seemed to end a bit soon. The quirky great-uncle Gum (Richard Griffiths) returns and everything seems fine a bit too quickly. Otherwise, it's great for families, especially pre-teen girls."
1,DVD didn't work,"I've tried it in my DVD player, my laptop (bought about a year ago), my Xbox 360 slim, and another DVD player. Returning this. I really wanted to watch Emma Watson. :["
5,Fit my engine stand perfectly.,"Black ABS plastic. Fits perfectly, catches the oil, keeps the floor clean. I had to drill holes and add bolts to firmly attach to engine stand, to avoid kicking it off or bumping it off, but otherwise no issues or complaints."
5,Highly Recommended,This is the best that upproductions has to offer. A must for any freeheeler's library. So get those tapeworms ready and get up there. My legs burn just watching it..over and over again.
1,The worst XP drivers I've ever seen,"RipFlash Plus comes equipped with the worst-behaved drivers I've ever seen. I'm a network administrator with 20 years in personal computing, and after four hours fiddling with this driver, I shipped the product back. A complete waste of time and money. I highly recommend passing on this one. Examples: the included application causes a hard XP crash, requiring a system restore. The so-called intallation for XP is a DOS batch file! The manual is written is such broken English that it's nearly impossible to read. The RipFlash firmware update is impossible to load because it requires the application, and the application crashes! Drivers are not signed (Microsoft certified), meaning that even Microsoft says you're using this at your own risk. Bad, bad, bad product. There's no excuse for this kind of lack of quality control. Don't waste your time with Pogo Products. The Olympus DM1 is a far superior voice recorder (I've used it for six months now, and it works well.)"
4,RipFlash Plus just what I wanted,"Received the Ripflash Plus recently, and had no problems loading software, ripping CD's, or downloading music. The manual should be edited by someone whose primary language is English, but, even though the manual is a bit cryptic, I was still able to find out what I needed to know. I am quite happy with the purchase."
1,Drivers don't software wont and in general a bad time,"Advice - find another product to buy. Installing the drivers - turns Windows into plug and pray. The bundled software stinks - comprehensively. The support, if it can be called such, is no USEFUL support at all. The player has sat for 95% of its life as a paperweight. I only wish I could give this a MINUS STARS RATING. If I had a nickel every error message it displayed I could afford another player too."
4,Great Reference,"This product has proven to be an outstanding reference for a teacher of any subject. If you're looking to elaborate on a concept studied in class, music is an outstanding way to relate to students. With the ease of downloading music, lesson plans may be materialized in a matter of minutes with authentic discussion to follow. It works beautifully with any unit. Additionally, the book is categorized for easy reference."
3,Much..Much..Much better than Nirvana,"I am a nirvana fan, however the last reviewer needs to cut the cord. This is not Nirvanaesk, but it is a bit grunge. Puddle of Mud has soul in it's music, and the song ""she hates me"" is more or less a light-hearted bitter love song. Don't over analyze simplicity at its best. I would recommend this if you want a catchy guitar-rock song."
2,buyer beware,"The toy packaging was faded and cellophane was damaged when it arrived. The figure inside looked to be fine, but I got the impression this was either used or sat on a shelf a long time. It certainly didn't look NEW.Also, the toy was just placed loose in the box along with the rest of my audio/video order. Poor packaging all around from Amazon.I would have returned this except it was a Christmas gift and I had no time to make an exchange. I apologized to the recipient for the poor condition of the packaging."
3,"OK, perhaps some of the earlier collections would fare better","The Amazon review above pretty much sums up this collection. As a whole, the animation itself, of which there is a good mix of styles, is well done, but I was underwhelmed by the content/subject matter. Nothing bad here, yet, sadly, nothing particularly good either."
5,Sensible approach,"This book provides a comprehensive approach to both acute and chronic Lyme disease, examining allopathic treatments and providing well-researched core protocols through supplementation. Reading the book cover-to-cover provides a good breadth of information and insight, but the format also offers callout boxes providing core protocol information at-a-glance. I devised my core protocol from these boxes (while, of course, reading the cautionary statements and other vital information) and have already experienced an improvement in my immune response after just over a month.A balanced view that is both pragmatic and supportive of the frustration that surrounds this baffling disease, this book is a ready reference on my shelf."
4,Death Revisited,Call this 'Death and Burial Rites of the Celebrated'. This is an interesting take on the funeral rites of many famous people. I won't go into detail because this has already been done more than adequately in the first customer review. I was particularly fond of the manner in which the material was presented. I felt that the written accounts of the funeral rites discussed within presented a verbally visual sense of being there.The subjects discussed were from quite diverse levels of celebrity. The information presented was in some cases as much reflective of the historical time frame during which they occurred as well as the individuals being honored.This was a very interesting exhumation of information long buried and forgotten.
5,Poortvliet loves God,"The author imagines ""what fun Noah would have had drawing his animals..an opportunity like this never comes again! models that have all the time in the world what more could one want?"" The author has so much fun with this thought, musing ""...really, when you are in the same boat, this is a marvelous pastime!"" and the author adds, ""not only must Noah have made a lot of friends he also must have been lost in wonder looking about him: how had the dear God created it all! there is no escaping it unless one is stone-blind...he must often have murmured the words of Psalm 8--that was very like him..."" I love this, it's so simple, so pure, so much love for God shines through the author's words and drawings. Thank you Rien Poortvliet!"
5,Crown Prince sardines,Crown Prince Cross Pack sardines in oil. Excellent quality. I bought four cases for my personal use.
4,Worth the one song I wanted...and more,"I bought the cd, first for the song ""weakness in me"" and then after reading the reave reviews, and while some are bit old for me, there were a few songs worth listening to and reminiscng! She has an awesome voice and the lyrics to boot!There was one song not here that I would have liked...but nevertheless...enjoyable!"
5,Wintertime Divine Hours,This book beging on October 1. If it anything like the one I am just finishing I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Divine Hours that they can understand. Very helpful and easy to follow.
3,360 travel LCD screen,"I purchased the screen for use on a long car trip with the kids. Previously we had good success with the original Xbox and its travel screen. The 360 screen has a beeter screen and speakers than the original verions, but the mounting system was much more fussy and didn't really hold as well. I always felt like I had to be REALLY careful when folding the screen up or dowm. The hooks that lock into the wireless mount points were a pain to attach and releas. I realize that the curvey shape of the 360 presents some challenges for mounting a screen. I was alos disappointed to find out that My car DC/AC inverter was not powerful enough to run the 360 in the car."
2,not the best buy.....,"Well unless your on the go pretty much 24/7 and your going to die if you do not get that last achievement for whatever game your playing i would not buy this. If your in your car or you have no TV and you really wanna destroy your vision by playing on an HD TV thats 9 inches big. Go for it. Your probably better off using the tv thats in your mini van already or anything else besides this. If the 360 is that important to you that you must play it at the very moment, just pack it up be patient and wait till you get to a TV thats about 15 inches bigger than this one. most motels/hotels have those."
3,Does not work with Windows 7 (I know I should have read the specs first),"Just in case you were wondering, I attempted to get this to work on Windows 7 for off and on for 2 days with no luck. Even tried several of the posts out on Google to modify files and no luck. Just an fyi... like everyone else, simply need this for my Polar watch but don't want to spend 60 bucks on a simple device..."
3,Tough and time consuming,"Wow, I started this workshop as I am an avid journaler. But to do these exercises as he describes would take SO much time, thought and effort it just became overwhelming and a little frustrating to me. Good luck to anyone who can do it."
3,Eh...,"The show wasn't that great, but I missed one episodes, and had to buy it on Amazon. Provided some entertainment."
2,bad,just had for two day and then they stop working please buy an original one and do a favor to u and save money and time
4,needed...hard to find.,"These cables are not everything , everywhere cables so that usually makes them pricey and hard to find. item is as presented and arrived in great condition. Excellent purchase."
3,Good price and does the job,"I had lost the cable for my e-book. This cable was not as flexible, but worked fine. The price was much less than I had expected and delivery was as promised."
1,item works as advertised,"cheapest i could find.. seems to work so far.dont mind the one star, that was an accident"
4,Nice for the price,"The cables work fine. The jacket on the cable is a little thin, but it still works. I would recommend for the price."
1,Waste of money. I guess I received what I paid for it.,It did not work for my Portable Hard Drive. It is not recognized by USB port.
4,Very Satisfied,"I am satisfied with this product - it was what I expected to receive and it was shipped promptly. What more can I say? They seem to be good quality cables and their ends are the right shapes for what I want to do, which is plug them in to stuff."
1,Did not work,The cable would not allow for file transfers. Many times it would not even show that a device was connected. I would not recommend this product.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,it's advertised as 2 meters or 6.56 feet yet it's less than 6 feet long. (don't know the exact measurement but i held one end of the chord between my toes and stretched it straight and it only went up to about my chin and last time i checked i was 6feet 1inch not 7feet and 1inch which i would have to be for the length of the chord to be 2meters or 6feet and 6.6 inches THAT'S ABOUT A WHOLE FOOT SHORTER THAN ADVERTISED BUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLSHIIIIIIIIIIT
4,Happy with purchase,"This usb cable fit my MP3 Player just like I hoped it would. Fast, affordable, and glad with my purchase. I recommend this product."
5,cable,The product was exaclty what I wanted. A little bit shorter than I expected. But worked perfect in my HD.
3,So You Want To Be Like Christ? workbook,The workbook seems to be a good book to accompany the reading book by him. It will be a good help to go through while reading the book itself.
3,3.5 stars,"Let me start by saying, That I Love Kitty! What a name for a werewolf right? Yeah some curl joke on her. But you know she was born human so life tossed her a few lemons!Kitty starts life off as a wolf on the bottom of the pole, she's the one bullied and picked on, last to do everything with in the pack. She has one good friend with in the pack T.J. He takes care of her, in the best of his abilities.After all the stuff that has happened to Kitty, she finally gets a break. A radio show call the Midnight hour. I think that show does a wonder for her. It helps her find her-self and I don't think in a bad way either. A lot of bad happens but at the same time, some good comes out of everything.Overall, I am looking forward to reading book 2 in the Kitty Noville!I enjoyed the book quit a lot after a little bit in to it...Give the story a chance and read it all the way, you might be surprised!!"
4,Had trouble putting this one down....,"Kitty Norville, a werewolf, is a late night radio DJ who accidentally starts a talk show that addresses the problems of those of a supernatural nature. Her show becomes an instant surprise hit, making both the vampires and her werewolf pack angry with her. The vampires hire a werewolf assassin to stop her show while her own werewolf pack insists that she stop the show. Kitty surprises even herself when she defies both the werewolves and the vampires by continuing her show. After all, she is a werewolf with the ironic name of ""Kitty""! Meanwhile, Kitty assists the local police with catching a serial killer. This is a delightful beginning to a new series and I am eagerly awaiting Kitty's next adventure."
3,Bad Kitty!,"Um, yes this book did have a good premise.Werewolf comes clean over the radio waves to help others of her kind. But people aren't sure if she's just a ratings hungry cook or something scarily more.And when the local vampire mafia puts a hit out on her for spilling the sup secret her asassin tries to whack her on air- only getting her more ratings... & a date with her attacker? This was a good spin! I sort of pictured him as John Cusack in Grosse Point Blank.Til that point it was a great book. But the rest of the book was ssssssooooooooo stereotypical, overdone werewolf book. That's dissapointing when she had made this so fresh. You could see the end coming a mile away. I'll optomistically await the sequal, but I won't hold my breath."
5,Eye Opening!,A different turn on vampires and were-wolfs. Look forward to the next one or two or three.....
1,Another tiresome paranormal,"I keep trying every new paranormal hoping to run into a story with teeth and substance. Instead I keep running into chick lit with a non human character thrown in. Instead of a strong book with strong characters I keep finding books with misunderstood, put upon heroines. I couldn't even get past the first few chapters. Borrow this one."
4,Very good read,"I rarely right reviews but I also rarely read two books in one day. In the case of Carrie Vaughn I guess I have to make two exceptions in the same day. Being a history buff, I was intrigued by Discord's Apple and read that in about 4 hours. I liked that so much I kindled up Kitty and The Midnight Hour and stayed up late finishing that. These are very fun reads. I am giving them both 4 stars. For me that is a very high rating as a 5 star book has to really change my whole perspective on something. In terms of just really good storytelling these books are hard to beat. Ms. Vaughn does a really good job of developing the characters. Kitty is smart mouthed and funny. It is really easy to identify with her as a person striving to define herself in her own terms. I did enjoy reading a book with a very feminine lead character who really takes charge of the situation. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
5,"Well written book with depth and value. Rewards rereading, too!","While I'm usually a skeptic of fantasy as a genre, and doubly so of vampire/werewolf fiction, I find this book surprisingly delightful. My first read of the ARC gave me hints of depth and metaphor that stretch far beyond what I normally expect of a first time author, and required a second reading. Rarely do books of this genre offer more than a stage for the sexual fantasies of socially stunted teens this one, however, offers metaphoric discourse on race, prejudice, homosexuality, HIV/AIDS, and gender issues. Yet, unlike most books that strive woodenly for a social relevance, this book also offers a very solid story that holds the reader from cover to cover. The book is unusually short for a modern fantasy offering, (which is in itself quite refreshing) and the author goes straight to the story without a lot of self-indulgent fluff that seems to be the earmark of most current urban fantasy novels. Overall, I highly recommend this book."
3,book was really short,This book was really short and I felt like the ending was abrupt. I'm currently reading the second one and it's a little better. I hope the ending is better as well
5,Great Unexpected Disk,"Suzanne Vega pulls back a bit from the 'left of center' (reference intended) disk of '99.9 F Degrees' w/this album. Though I loved her first two albums, this one is by far my favorite. It blends part of the folk aspect of 'Suzanne Vega' and 'Solitude Standing' w/some of the edge of '99.9 F'. It is the perfect mix. (i purposely do not mention 'Days of Open Hand' b/c I find it is so entirely weak.)There truly is no bad song on this album and producer/then-husband, Mitchell Froom, brings out the best in her performances. ""Stockings"", ""No Cheap Thrill"", ""Headshots"", ""Birth-day"" and ""Honeymood Suite"" really make the album - though I mentioned, there really is no bad song.I was hoping she would continue in this vein after her marriage broke up. Her subsequent disk is good - but really reverts back to her first two albums.Obviously w/a five start rating, I would suggest you pick this disk up."
5,"CONTENT RICH - GREAT TO SEE BLAKE, JUSTINE, AND CHRISSY!","I bought the whole library - if you want to get the specific teaching, you should look into the individual titles that go with the series. Comprehensive is an overview of all aspects of tennis and I think is great for players that already have a basic mastery of the game but want to hear and see detail and insights to make their game better. Its not just drills - there is a lot of talk and instruction with JC, Chrissy, Blake, Justine, the Bryan Bros, and Tracy Austin. If you are looking for the basic instructional DVD, this is not it. You can look into one of the other titles in the series for specific skills sets, drills, etc. This DVD is a combination of philosophy, instructions, personal stories, and drills - there is plenty to learn here and its entertaining to watch."
2,Solemnity but so little surprise,"These are ""good"" poems but little more, I could use them as classic cases of the type of work produced in countless minor MFA programs, simple narratives that strive for lyric intensity, but fail due to their obvious neglect of more sophisticated uses of language. Don't get me wrong, there is some good here, and Ward offers a few fine portraits of the daily life lived, but they falter in so many places due to the lack of deep engagement I encountered. I feel as if I have read too many of these poems too often, sucb a safe and so consequently careless art he practices, solemnity with so little surprise."
3,Picture OK But Doesn't Fill Screen,"The picture quality on this is fine, if that's all you care about. It does flicker a lot on startup and such but that seems to be pretty standard for these kinds of things.The biggest negative is that the picture does not fill the TV screen (i.e. not enough overscanning). It does have vertical size adjustments but they don't fix this problem. I just called the manufacturer and they said that it is a known problem. Buy the TView Silver if you want to avoid this."
4,TView Micro PC-to-TV Scan Converter,Works just as I expected. I am using it to come out of a computer (Mac) to split and go one way to a video mixer via RCA cables and the other way to a projector using VGA.
5,"Only 8 Songs, But Each is a Gem","Serenade is a gem of an album in which Neil Diamond tells eight separate stories from my favorite on this album, ""The Last Picasso"" to ""Lady Magdelane."" The music is rich and this really is an album to relax to and let him serenade you."
2,Disappointing,I have read many of Hern's novels and was suprised that this was written by her too.The story was silly! Based on a misunderstanding that no sane person who is not a child would buy into!It almost felt like the author had to write something; like she had a deadline and was forced to write something when she was not at all inspired to do so!Please read some of her other work cause she is a good author of this genre BUT avoid this one.
3,Not quite up to standard,"For the most part Ms Hern's books are a delight. This one is not quite up to the standard of the rest. The characterization is good, the general plot is funny but a bit too far-fetched. Enjoyable reading except for the very irritating habit, shared by too many American writers, confusing 'receipt' with 'recipe'.A receipt is an acknowledgement of payment usually money. A recipe is a statement of ingredients and procedure for preparation of a dish in cookery or medical prescription. To be forever reading 'receipt' when 'recipe' is meant, makes a mockery of the editing process. How it could possibly have passed not only several readings by the author but by a professional editor, completely escapes me!"
4,Excellent history; could have used a bit more primary exceprts.,"Not surprisingly, Sanders has crafted an excellent historical survey of the development and nuances of English lit. It's well worth reading to gain a better understanding of why and how English lit has looked at various times in history.About the only thing I would have liked to see was a little more in the way of excerpts from notables here. Sanders does include some, and I know we can't have everything we'd like in a history that has the word 'shorter' in the title; I guess that's not so much a complaint as just a lament about concise surveys in general... and now I'm off-topic. anyhow, this is superbly constructed and solidly written, and I enjoyed myself."
3,Average soundtrack for an average film,"This early James Horner score fits the film well, as it is sparse and haunting. The title track (which opens the film) consists of a synthesizer and chimes and sets the mood for the entire film. However, this combined with a little monastic chant bogs down after about the first ten minutes or so. For diehard Horner fans only."
3,A best book on Statistical Pattern Recognition,"Multivariate analysis is borrowed to name a NEW subject, Statistical Pattern Recognition (SPR). Many statisticians think it unfair or a shame. In spite of these, it is a good reference book of SPR. :-)[1] Many contents of this book can be found in any graduate textbook of Multivariate Analysis, for instance, Fisher's linear disciminant, etc.[2] The book is badly printed. Why not using LaTeX?[3] Guassian distribution is assumed here and there.[4] It may be good as a reference book, but definitely not as a textbook."
4,Demolition Man / Over The Top Double Feature Dvd,Demolition Man / Over The Top Double Feature Dvd. This is a good double feature dvd. Demolition Man Is better than Over The Top.
1,Messed up version of demolition man!,"well I love all of Stallone's movies, would have loved Demolition man but it had commentary throughout the entire thing! U can't watch and listen to a movie with that crap in your way! Over the top played fine however! great movie! one star for demolition man not being able to hear and watch!"
5,Ladyfingers and Nun's Tummies -- Positive Review!!,"Ordered this unusual book (after reading about it in a newspaper article) and ordered it thru amazon.com. The book was received very quickly and was in excellent condition. The only thing I could find the slightest bit wrong was that the Goodwill stickers had been left on it -- and Goodwill's price was less than I'd paid!!Otherwise, a very interesting book about how foods got their unusual names."
5,great,"Love the toe ring, got it for my sister to replace one that broke, this one is much better made and she was thrilled."
1,Tony Mottola is nowhere to be found!,"BEWARE!!! This CD appeared when I conducted a search for the great guitarist Tony Mottola so I ordered it. Much to my disappointment after it arrived, I eagerly cranked up the amplifier alas Tony was nowhere to be heard! What a waste of $27. So if you are looking for Tony Mottola playing on CD, don't buy this one! Please fix your description of this CD ""horizons50""."
4,Good Product,Very good product and does make your hair feel good but didn't come with a nozzle on it.
3,Doesn't match up to her debut album,"Sheryl Crow's second album, self titled, doesn't do nearly as much as her first album did. A more electronic collection of music, the songs ""Maybe Angels"" and ""Home"" show that she still has this rock and roll thing going for her, but the singles she released (especially ""A Change"" and ""If It Makes You Happy"") suggests that this album is just an attempt to keep going after her grammy winning first album. While her most recent ""The Globe Sessions"" proves to show her strengths more, this album for me, a Sheryl Crow fan, was a disappointment. The lyrics don't grab you the way they did in songs like ""Strong Enough"" and ""I Shall Believe,"" and the tunes don't flow as well and aren't as catchy. This album reveals a more angry Sheryl Crow, perhaps just a product of rock and roll nowadays."
4,Solid Follow-Up,"This release was a solid follow-up to Ms. Crow's first release showcasing her talent, and confirming that she was no fly-by night one hit wonder. Very enjoyable."
3,it was nice,I'm not really a fan of sheryl's but I remember liking her music the most when she was releasing singles from this album. Everyday is a winding road is an unforgotten 90's classic from this record.
3,I thought there was more to this CD,"I was so excited about getting this CD, and when I got it, realized there were only two good songs. I should have checked into it better, but make sure you like more than two songs of this CD."
1,Would rather listen to Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill,"I was not all that crazy about Alanis's Jagged Little Pill when it was all the rage. Then came Sheryl Crow's whinning about how ""Everyday Is A Winding Road"" and how her man done bring her ""Anything But Down"". And Alanis's JLP album wasrendered a better listen than Crow's cry-baby singing.I enjoyed Crow's ""All I Wanna Do"" and she, again suprised me with her doing of ""The First Cut Is The Deepest"" and I wish she would stay within those boundries in her singing because she is enjoyable that way."
1,pretty weak,aside from everyday is a winding road there's nothing here worth mentioning.her writting is run of the mill and the music lacks any kind of feeling or depth.she is one of the most overrated artists out here today.catchy more than substance.
5,"Very, very good","While I do not think Sheryl Crow has a particularily good singing voice, her songwriting is top notch and she proves it on this album. This is definitely her best CD, thanks to such gems as If It Makes You Happy and The Book."
5,One of the Best Albums of the '90s!,"With her self-titled sophomore effort, Sheryl Crow shakes off the mixed-bag singer-songwriter feel of ""Tuesday Night Music Club"" and firmly establishes her signature sound: the-girl-next-door channels the Stones, and does it well. With hard-edged yet soulful vocals, classic-rock instrumentation, plenty of hooks, studio experimentation, and an overall ""fat"" sound, ""Sheryl Crow"" is a classic of contemporary roots rock. While it does weaken a bit near the end (one or two of the last songs could have been left off), this disc remains Sheryl's best work and one of the best albums of the 1990s."
2,Mediocre at best.,The only thing thats good about it is the small size. Its cute but gets stuck really easily..
1,Spend the Money for More Machine,"I would rate lower if given the option. This item was a gift to my husband for Christmas. I tested it out to learn how to operate the machine so that I could teach him. I was so very disappointed. For the first 3 minutes, the machine began sewing great. After that everything went downhill. I was trying to sew lightweight jogging suit cotton material. The needle jammed and the machine stopped. The only way to get the needle out was to bend it. After about 20 minutes, I was able to get the needle out. I replaced the needle with another one and it jammed also. I was totally disgusted because the machine professes to sew denim material. I took it back to the store and will just spend more money to get a professional sewing machine. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,A Waste of Money!,"The worse product I ever bought. It did not sew, it was impossible to thread and made me so frustrated that I threw it in the garbage."
2,threading the bobbins,"I am traveling and it is a smart tool to have for quickjobs. Although, I have misplaced the instructions to fillthe bobbins with higher quality thread. I believe all theattachments are here with me. Unfortunately, there isn't anybobbin coding system or marks on the machine to indicate theprocess for threading them. Someone with no experience would'ntbe able to figure it out. I will not give up. I'm stickingparts in the various holes to test which way works. Oh, by theway, don't drop the little spring, it's seems to be a vitalpart."
1,Big Disappointment !,I purchased this machine for my daughter to start learning how to work with a sewing machine. What a disappointment! The bottom bobbin does not work correctly. It seems that there are parts missing. I'm returning it today for a refund.
2,The result of one man making a book with no review.,"Well, Shames has done it again. With this fourth edition students will be gaping with pleasure and awe as they deal with contradictory statements and curt text which assumes much and reveals little. Can you identify the elusive ""incorrectly answered"" question in chapter 1? If the bland monochrome illustrations don't keep you glued to this chart-topper, the interesting pictures of bridges near the author's home will. And don't forget all of the ""practical military experiences"" one will gain from solving endless ballistic and ""tank-up-the-hill"" problems. Oh wait, maybe it's extreme frustration coupled with a boatload of problems due that will keep you in on Thursday nights! Author's note: Beware! Shames has been known to hassle students for even possessing other engineering texts in his class!"
4,three live tracks are great,"Sheryl Crow's Strong Enough CD single has excellent live versions of All I Wanna Do, Reach Around Jerk, and my favorite performance of Leaving Las Vegas ever. Worth having for big fans."
1,"Very Disappointing... Ditto, Ditto","Noah's ark birdhouse - Style 31248This is not a birdhouse! There is no room for a bird to nest or to place birdseed as a feeder. Very poorly constructed and would never survive the elements. Cute idea, hopefully someone will produce a better designed and constructed one (hint, hint)."
2,Not as advertised,"This is not a birdhouse that would survive in the outdoors, especially on a LIGHT windy day. It is cheaply made, and is more appropriate as indoor decoration."
2,Not what I am used to in quality,"I do not know if I received a bad marker, but the chisel tip seemed like it was out of ink. This was from the very first use. The fine point worked as expected."
4,A Fabulous Introduction!,"Dr. Christianson's ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a quality choice for readers who want to learn the inside dealings of how a biography is written. The style Christianson uses to write the articles flows and shapes into a simple story the reader can easily follow. His articles on the back-door operations of a biographer at work clearly illustrate how complex the profession of historian can be. With several references to his previous works, the reader becomes enthralled in the lives of many of his subjects and may very well want to dive into the other biographies. ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a great choice for would-be biographers to learn the tricks of the trade, and for a easy-reading for current biographers as well."
4,Any Moment,Follow the guidelines or make up your own. This book is written for the seeker & devout. Whatever you seek you will find here. The spirituality of this book allows you to bring Spirit into your presence at any time. Follow the Hours and you will find you are in relationship to God constantly. Open at any moment of your day/night and you will be in contact with the higher spirit you seek.
4,Excellent tool for Daily Office,"This is a fine way to practice the Daily Office. It speaks to the heart and is beautifully written. My husband and I use it for family devotions. It is wonderful for that. In my private devotions I like to use the more lengthly version found in the BCP and add this to it. It is perfect when you need a lite Office. It is also perfect for someone just starting to practice the Office or for someone's evening devotions with family. My son will be receiving a copy of this to use with his family. It is a great gift.The reason I give it four stars is that it is very large, fat paperback. I would carry it everywhere with my BCP and Bible were it smaller. As is I leave it at home and use it there. I would also love to see a leather bound edition. I would own one."
5,Supberb,Just received this product and if you want to shorten your time at the ironing board this is the item you want. Linen blouse pressed out in 2 minutes. I hate ironing but based upon my trial of this item last night recommend this to anyone. The iron does not have the water so there is less weight. The steam shoots out about 18 inches. Highly recommend.
4,AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!,"My roomate in boarding school would NOT stop playing this song eight years ago, and I have not been able to get it outta my head since, so I have to buy the darn thing!"
3,Cultivating a Life for God: Multiplying . . . . Groups,"Book was purchased for another reader. Brief ""flip-through"" revealed no problems. Did not read though, so inadequate or incorrect information was not discovered."
3,"Great product, a few complications with delivery","The product is great and arrived in good shape. However, there were several problems with the delivery and it arrived late.But good overall experience."
5,Step-Dad Love It,"My Step-Dad loved this, he had collected several golf balls from various places or as gifts and they were laying around, so I knew he would like a place to display them. I got name plate appliques to put on either side of the emblem on top and it adds a nice personal touch. He has used it and still has room for more."
4,a quiet one,"a deaf garbage collector learns how to surf and will die at the end.that's the whole story.It makes me wonder how takeshi kitano is able to keep me seeing this film. Cause nothing seems to happen. No romance, no action, no overwhelming things, no great pictures, ...His way ist the way of silence. He loves to show us the lifes of underdogs and their way of life. One even wonders how the girl friend of shigeru feels like cause he doesn't take care much to her.This movie bring up a lot of questions and we can think about if afterwards. It's not a great movie with big feelings but it's worth to see it. Even so the good music."
4,Has lasted a long time,"I've owned this juicer for over 5 years and it's just now starting to have problems like not extracting enough juice, leaks, plastic wearing down. BUT I think 5 years for this low-priced juicer is a good life and I'm happy with that. It's been great. It's perfect for someone that juices occasionally and doesn't want to invest a lot of money. I'm going to upgrade to a more elite Breville this time. :)"
3,Breville JE95XL Two Speed Juice Fountain Plus,"Bought it due to high recommendation. After using it for 6 days, the juicer quit working. I loved it while it was working and plan to return it for a replacement. It was everything it promised except for a power supply problem. Amazon is standing behind it and replacing it (I think). Note: Breville's customer service number on the back of the instructions is not a valid number so if it quits working after 30 days, and no one answers the other number provided, so don't count on the 1 year warranty."
5,i love this juicer!,"This is a great juicer! I have never juiced before but I am really happy I started. This machine seems great so far. It is super fast and easy to lock into place. The two settings are great, use the low for lettuces and softer veggies/fruits.I would suggest cleaning fairly quickly after using, otherwise it the pulp/juice gets dry and hard to get off.It does take about 5 minutes to thoroughly clean by hand. However, you can wash the parts in the dishwasher but I would rinse before so the juice doesn't dry on the inside. My recommendation would be to make a large amount of juice in one setting so you don't have to keep cleaning it throughout the day. Just drink it within 24 hours of refrigerating. The pitcher it comes with is great to just stick in the fridge to keep the left overs!"
1,Save your money!,This machine was the horrible. It would leak and actually spray the pulp across the room. It would yield a very small amount of juice and is useless if your trying to juice greens. The pulp would be wet which meant your house would smell and attract fruit flies unless you emptied the garbage right away. Invest in a macerating juicer. A little more money but it will pay for itself in the long run.
1,falls apart and drops ties,This doesn't last a year and the wires all tilt and then come out. This is a total loss and will have to find something that works.If there as a way to enter NO STARS I would choose that.
2,Doesn't last long,I have purchased 2 of these hairdryers now and experienced same result with both dryers. After 18 months or so the heater cores went and they only blew cold air. Definitely not a good long term investment as I found out twice.
1,CHI TURBO EMF HAIR DRYER /SUPPLIER OMNI,"I had previously owned one of these hair dryers and loved the product, so I ordered a new one. Owned the other one for 5 years, great product....This new dryer came and the first time I turned it on it was apparent it was defective, the motor was making a terrible sound. I followed Amazon's return policy and sent an email to supplier Omni requesting a number so that I could return the product for a full refund. Omi still has not responded to my email which Amazon confirmed to me that it had been sent.I will never buy another product on Amazon, and I will never buy another CHI Turbo EMF hairdryer. I am sure this was another inferior Chineese manufactured product.Buyer beware!!!"
2,Works great but short element life,I have enjoyed the Chi brand hair dryers for several years but it seems the elements tend to burn out early. The last two Ultra Chi hair dryer elements have failed early. The first one at 13 months and the second one at 8 months. Not gonna bother with the warranty procedure. I am giving another brand a chance to shine.
5,Fantastic approach to Latin music,"This is a wonderful collection of new songs, mostly instrumental, all with a Latin flavor. The musicians are all first-rate. You'll want to play it again and again."
3,where is the errata for this book?,"I am trying to study from this book and, because there are some mistakes, I am interested where I could find the errata. I tried at McGraw-Hill without success. Any idea?Thank you."
2,Stanley Kramer Film Collection?,Stanley Kramer directed only the 1st 2 films. The other 3 he only servedas the producer. He made many great films. This collection does not dohim justice.
5,Great Value for $24.00!!,"I read a review from someone lamenting the fact that ""The Member of the Wedding"" is not available on DVD by itself. I ask you; Where can you get 5 classics for $5.00 apiece? This outstanding Stanley Kramer Collection boxed set features ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", ""Ship of Fools"", ""The Member of the Wedding"", ""The Wild One"", and ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T."" There is also a bonus ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" disk with special features. Anyone waiting for ""The Member of The Wedding"" to be released on DVD by itself might be waiting a long time! Not to mention a single release could easily cost what these 5 films together are selling for. I believe this package provides an excellent opportunity to add classic films to one's collection!"
3,Pretty but not high quality,"This set is very pretty. It is also soft and comfortable. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because of the quality, which is not very good. Upon opening my box, I noticed that the velvet-like material on the darker leaves had started to come off and the stitching started was coming apart. I can't imagine what this set will look like after a having it a year!! Yikes....Also, I have a king-size bed and therefore ordered the king set. Well.....it doesn't quite fit. It's short on the sides by about six (6) inches, so be sure to keep this in mind. The king set would fit a queen bed perfectly!Overall though, it is pretty."
1,Five Skies,"I was very disappointed in the condition of this book. I knew it was used, but it was rated very good. There is underlining, as well as comments written in the margins throughout. I would never order a book from this vendor again. I would not trust this vendor's rating system."
2,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"Karen carpenter's solo album can best be described as a wacky,directionless recording session. No one can honestly say that this is a good album.-and that is the basic reason it wasn't released in 1980.This album tries to pass karen off as a top 40 pop-rock singer and she's NOT a top 40 pop-rock singer.Karen Carpenter is a torch singer-and this should have been the album that solidified her standing in the jazz world.(next to her peers Ella Fitzgerald and Rosemary Clooney).The material on this album is very weak,her vocals are too high on several songs and the overall production is poor.(although I admit ""if we try"" is a good track-minus the rousing horn solos).What amazes me is that a horrible album like this was recorded right after a masterpiece like CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT."
5,This is the bible of SAR tracking books,This is the bible of SAR tracking books and should be on the shelf of every individual interested in search and rescue.
5,LOVE,I've had these for a little over a year now and I LOVE them.. I've previously owned some of these and needed new ones. they are a very good product.
4,Sweet Sandals,"A little stiff at first but now they're nice and broken in. Super comfy, super light, super stylish; I'd buy them again."
4,Haiti nightmares,Good book. Farmer exposes his wealth of experience and the sad fate of Haiti in this book. A must read for all those who wish to work in Haiti.
3,Same as Okabashi Eurosport?,"Other than the CleanFreek logo inserted in place of Okabashi's in the top of the heel, these appear to be identical to Okabashi Eurosport sandals that can be found on their website for $14.95 (The Okabashi name is molded into the bottom of the sandals). They're good shoes and I do like them, but unless CleenFreak has added some kind of magic coating to make them even more hygenic than Okabashi's, there doesn't seem to be any reason to spend the extra money."
2,smaller than expected,"The item arrived, as promised. I was not satifisfied with the quaility of the product."
3,Ancient History,"This dew heater served It's purpose for awhile, but now there's a new generation controller on the market. The ""Condensation Eliminator"" No more blinking light, no more guessing what your battery voltage is and no more guessing how much current your heaters are drawing. This 3 channels, 6 outputs can heat your finder scope, guide scope and main scope at the same time and tell you how much current each channel is drawing or how much everything is drawing. It even has a redundant power path should the meters ever (unlikely) fail. And best of all it's not as expensive as the digifire 7"
3,not too happy,"I purchased this costume to go along with other random pieces I put together for my final halloween costume. I ended up using the skirt and lace head piece but was not very satisfied with the outfit. It looks like it is a dress or semi- flattering outfit, but is not at all. The shirt is tiny and comes up above the belly button and is really cheap. The skirt comes up really high but is cute at the bottom. I also purchased a petticoat to go underneath which gave it some extra oomph. Hope this helps some!"
4,This Album rocks!!!!,"I really like this album. Number 4 ""Cell Block Tango"" is a really great song it is both goofy and serious at the same time. That is why I love it!"
2,no student I know...,"My going-off-to-college student is all the title implies. I wish, I wish, I wish the recipes lived up to the other reviews. This assumes you have more of a stocked kitchen to work with and will be interested in starting from scratch. There are actually words like ""homemade mild tomato salsa"" and ""toasted pine nuts"". There's alot of explanation...more words than recipes, I think. This is very readable, very cute, and looks like pretty good food, but not for the hungry, harried college student in a dorm who isn't going to roast peppers or go get fennel, celeriac or even fresh broccoli."
5,Bought for Grandson learning to cook,Grandson wants to learn to cook before he goes to college next year. His Mother said she will also use it.Fast shipping.
3,This DVD is Criminal,"Vile, with no redeeming factors. The only good part of this movie was when a cop stated that one of the criminals should be a participant in a police shooting.Imagine sitting in your living room with several ignorant, egocentric thieves, rapists, prostitutes and murderers. Imagine watching their poorly made home movies with them. Imagine listening to self absorbed, graphic descriptions and rationales for their crimes. Imagine total disgust at the stupid excuses and total lack of remorse in their statements. Interspersed among this is faintly liberal poetry and scenes that try to convince the viewer that the problem is society and not the criminal. That makes this film criminal.This DVD might be Ok at a price of $10 or so, but at $22 it's a waste of money. It might be good for a kid to watch if he is starting to get involved in petty crime, or to convince you to carry a gun. The one thing that this film does is shatter any illusion that we live in a safe society."
2,Not as billed,"Mr. Hertsgaard is a good writer, but his title is misleading. He spends little time talking about how America is viewed by the rest of the world. He begins each chapter with a few words along those lines, then trails off into a long exposition of his personal political beliefs which are left of the left wing. He has some good points but the book does live up to its title. I read it but am still largely in the dark as to how America is viewed by the rest of the world."
3,XFL - Long Bomb,Thanks for the book. I am an american football buff and this book is a welcome addition to my collection
2,The XFL didn't live up to expectations; nor does this book.,"Aside from going into significant detail mentioning how Dick Butkus couldn't fit his RV into a stadium parking lot, The book fails miserably at telling the true, full story behind the XFL's failure. Instead it spends time going into the lives of players from the Las Vegas Outlaws and how their quarterback lamented his failure to reach stardom via the NFL.The XFL failed to hit its mark because it didn't connect with its core audience - football fans. This book fails to hit its mark because it didn't connect with its core audience, either."
4,Great For International Travel,"My wife bought three ActionPackers this summer, and she is very happy with the purchase. I think they are a little expensive, but they are a good product. The storage boxes are very durable and lightweight. I could see all three of our ActionPackers lasting for many, many years. They are easy to carry, and the lids snap on tight. The latches have small holes that allow you to use plastic tie-strips or locks if you desire. Some minor improvements could be made to the product. It would be great if the ActionPackers had small wheels as well as a lid that allowed you to stack the boxes on top of one another without them sliding off each other. Despite this, we are very thankful that a friend suggested purchasing these as opposed to more suitcases."
4,"Sturdy Enough, Meets My Needs","I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size, one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival (bug out) box. I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses, I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable, I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures, they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable."
4,Very handy box,This box was just what I needed to make a weatherproof storage containiner for a small solar charging station!
4,Good storage,"I use actionpackers for professional work in wild remote areas of Africa. They are light and extremely strong, offering perfect protection to fragile items. They do not crush after 2 trips like old fashion, heavy metal trunks.From time to time, however, a handle can break, and that's the end of it, because you can't lock your actionpacker anymore. But it does happen after a lot of use and generally because of overweight."
1,"Poor dialogue, shallow characters","Child prostituion is a delicate subject requiring extraordinary talent in its handling. This author does not have that talent. Her dialogue was cliche, the events unendingly grim to the point I stopped caring even about the poor heroine, and the one ""happy"" relationship with the Afgani bordered on Harlequin Romance shallow and boring."
3,"Starts strong, then peters out","The first two-thirds of The Linnet Bird are fast-paced, engrossing--the stuff of page-turners. Then the protagonist, Linny, makes the decision to travel from Liverpool to India. The decision is a mistake for Linny, and for the novel.With the change in locale, the book shifts from a brutal but believable tale of life in the underbelly of 19th-century society and the possibility of redemption to a second-rate bodice-ripper complete with improbably coincidences and cardboard characters. It's as if the heat the enervates Linny and her acquaintances weighed down on the author's imagination as well.Nonetheless, the writing is nothing less than first rate throughout--evocative without being verbose--and Linny is a likeable, engaging character. So while the last section of the book is, in my opinion, the weakest, it's still stronger than so many other historical novels out there."
4,"Very good despite a misleading ""Best of""","This release is deceptive since it is really nothing more than China Crisis' 90's albums -- ""Warped by Success"" and ""Acoustically Yours"" -- repackaged with a few tracks omitted and a club version added. The above two albums were never released in the States.""Warped by Success"" was more or less panned by critics, but upon listening to these songs, I was pleasantly surprised. Their soft rock, jazzy, Steely-Dan-influenced style continues and it sounds just as good as their late 80's efforts. Some might find it a bit sappy, but it all flows very nicely. The ""Acoustically Yours"" live tracks are excellent."
2,Don't waste your money.,"After reading this book, I still haven't decided whether the author is a genius or a nutcase.Most of the main characters ultimately die a particularly useless and gruesome death, and the book never seems to arrive at a particular point. Even the prologue drags on endlessly."
2,Wes Craven In The Old West,"The final installment in the Lonesome Dove series is more of a macabre romp worthy of Wes Craven; a Nightmare on Laredo Street.In some of the most gruesome mutilations and deaths to destroy the myth of the anti-hero, author Larry McMurtry is seemingly writing for himself; burying the characters who survived the initial three novels in what ultimately becomes a very predictable plot of the oftentimes tragic battles within families and the consequences of venturing into a world that is driven by the coldest of hate.The Epilogue of vignettes finally pushes the story to its rightful conclusion and has a plot that is actually a bit more intriguing than the main work.While the book should be mostly viewed as a means for a reader to conclude the series, it is not one of McMurtry's finest moments, unless this is actually a bizarre nod to classic horror fiction."
1,A ridiculous cartoon using Lonesome Dove characters.,"The aimless wanderings of Call mirror the writer, who apparently knew he needed alot of violence, but couldn't quite string the segments together."
2,Should have stopped at three,"First, I have to say Lonesome Dove is a masterpiece of the American West. Second, Comanche Moon and Dead Man's Walk are very enjoyable. I think McMurtry should have stopped there. What made Lonesove Dove were the wonderful characters and the wonderful adventures each of them were having. Every character, wether you loved or hated them, had a story that drew you in and held you. Unfortunatly most of them are killed off in Lonesome Dove leaving little to start a new novel with. The ones that have made it are so dramatically different it is hard to relate to them as the same people. This novel also never really draws you into the story at hand like the previous. There are high points and overall I am glad that I read it just to see where McMurtry went with this saga. However, as a whole it was a great disappointment from the earlier works."
3,"Good, but no Lonesome Dove","This was a good book but I was disappointed in the lack of enthusiasm that the characters had. Compared to Lonesome Dove, this book was even more of a downer. Lonesome Dove was sad but in good, touching ways, whereas Streets of Laredo was sad in an uncomfortable way. It made me not like Capt. Call anymore. He no longer seemed like a mystery man with his own thoughts, but became very pathetic. When I finished this book I didn't think back on it very much. It was just over."
3,Huh?,"I bought this from some glowing pitchforkmedia review. Ive only listened to it 3 times, but i dont get it. I thought these guys were supposed to be some grand song writers, but i just hear some throwaway, rather mediocre songs. The melodies arnt greatly original. The guitar playing is standard. Its like these guys write 10 songs a day, but dont bother to refine any of them. Hmm. Looks like ill have to check this out again, maybe ive missed something."
4,sure why not,"Despite some rather odd choices and omissions, this is a pretty good introduction to GBV. They have so many good songs though that Bob could've picked another completely different 32 and this would have been just as good. Under The Bushes is severely under-represented here though."
5,Simply awesome!,"It's been so long since I've seen such a wonderful and thoughtful movie that made me both laugh AND cry!! I believe it not only touched my heart but touched my soul as well. The messages really spoke to me and I'm certain will speak to others in a profound way, especially those who feel isolated and yearn to find that ""treasure"" that at times seems lost forever."
4,Surpassed My Expectations!,"Excellent movie! Well written, well acted, interesting story, strong message. The message was easy for me to connect with and yet very deep--the issue of loneliness and connecting with others in the church. This is a solid Christian movie not afraid of sharing the message of the gospel and yet a very well made movie. I had high expectations going in and it surpassed them.The four stars are because I was disappointed with the point of tranformation in the end I felt it was not handled well for both characters and drew me out of the story; however, the final resolution drew me back in again.All in all I'd recommend it highly!"
5,SAVE THIS SERIES! DEMAND MORE SEASONS!,"Invasion is an excellent series with an excellent plot cast with excellent actors.THe series presents a fresh new Altantis twist on the X-Files, EBE, Aliens among us theme.After watching the entire series in this set I am stunned that it was canceled after a single season.This series should be renewed with a 2nd season.Cry out!And for God's sake...be careful near the water's edge!:-)Jason Charles Reichenbach, Esq.Eastern KentuckyUSA"
3,"""Invasion"" not invasive enough.","While the plotting lacked forward momentum and the female characterizations were totally ridiculous, this series provided great value for under $20 dollars. There was very little sci-fi and not nearly enough of the cover-up or conspiracy threads usually associated with ""alien invasion"" TV shows, and what there was of these two elements lacked luster and inspiration. Nevertheless, it held my limited interest for the duration of the series, and probably would have improved had it been allowed to continue."
5,Invasion,"I really loved this series. I really hope that somewhere in the future the orginal cast. I would love to see this back on the air. Right now there is nothing on ABC, NBC, FOX the only network that has anything right now is CBS with the series The Event. Please pass this info on to the people that can do something about it. Thank you, Joanna Miller"
4,Closed Captioning,I religiously watched this show when it aired and was very ticked off when it was canceled without an ending.My one beef with the DVD is that it says it Closed Captioned but I have not been able to activate it.
5,"LOVE IT LOVE IT - ABC, PLEASE BRING IT BACK","With all the reality-hype tv shows out there and the burn-out I am seriously having with the same mundane ideas, this was such a welcome distraction for me when it first came on that I was just drawn in. I really hate it when I start to love a show and it gets cancelled, but there are a million shows of Big Brother or Survivor or whatever reality tv junk I cannot stand. This was new and different and I absolutely adored it. I would recommend it to anyone who might enjoy a little sci-fi break and an interesting plot. Now if they would only continue the story so I can find out what happens!!"
1,Missing disc 3 and 5,Did anybody not receive disc 3 and disc 5 and a new/sealed box????????Totally angry about this as i waited two weeks to receive it and now I cant even watch pass disc 2.......
1,YAWWNNN!!!!!,"What a stinker...I'm a BIG blues fan, and this guy is ONE BIG BORE!!! Predictable as all hell. Hope the next ones better...Hey Jonny, lay off the wahh wahh pedal huh!!??...its been done before.."
4,From the Beginning,"Finally the blues from North Dakota. That is were it all began. I was lucky enough to see him 3 times in Grand Forks at Griggs Landing before he went solo and left ""Kid"" Johnny Lang and The Big Bang, and have seen him grow into a very talented blues artist. If you get the chance see him LIVE!! I did in '95-'96 and in the begining he was captivating, now I'm sure he has done nothing but hone his skills. For the hard core fan I have info to get the ""1st"" CD ""Smoke"" with the Big Bang if interested just e-mail me."
5,it was so great!I loved it,"I first heard jonny lang last summer and I loved his song ""missing your love"".I now love his music and I also like the pop music like hanson.But his music is one of the few blues singers I listen to. Jonny Langs music made me listen to other blues music."
1,Used it twice... Engine seized,"Shame on me for not researching this weed triming before purchasing. It is heavy, hard to start, but worst of all, the engine seized after only using it twice. Upon taking it in to an authorized dealer for repair, they blamed me for not keeping the oil level to it's proper level. (not so. oil was just below top of filler hole) Troy-Built does not stand behind their product. So much for spending the extra bucks to get a good one. I will never buy another troy-built product."
2,"Starts fine, but line keeps getting jammed","Only one BIG issue with this unit. I spend more time unjamming the line than I do actually cutting. I go about 30 feet and then one side of line falls off, then about 10 feet later, the other falls out. I have to take off the line cover, pull out the string, re-insert into into the feed holes and then put back together. It then repeats the same thing about 30 feet later. It really adds a lot more time..... It triples the time that it would take if the line would just feed correctly...."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Save your money!!!!,We bought this weed eater from Lowe's in March. It lasted 3 months. While my husband was weed eating the yard he heard a noise and smelled something burning. It would not start again. We called the warranty number and was told to take it to a local warranty dealer. It has been in the shop almost 2 months waiting for him to hear back from Troy-Bilt. Hello... We bought it because we needed it. Now it's been almost two months without a weed eater. What do they expect me to do? Get out there and weed eat with a pair of scissors?!?!?! We have a very small yard so it wasn't used very long at each use. The warranty dealer said he has been getting a lot of these in his shop. Many people are having lots of problems with it. Something on the inside melted together on ours. Wish I had done a little research before I wasted over $200 on this piece of junk!!!! Save your money!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS WEED EATER!!!!!
1,Poor heavy and doesn't start well,"It is a lot heavier than my old 2 stroke,It starts well cold but will not restart when it hot."
1,Terrible Trimmer,"I recently purchased and quickly took this trimmer back. I first thought that having a 4 cyle engine was a good thing. Not. First it is very unbalanced and heavy. Second, it is very difficult to start. Third, you are told in the manual to disassemble the engine every 10 hours and adjust the valves. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, they suggest paying money to have it done. What?!!! Oh, they also tell you to make sure you replace the valve cover gasket everytime you do this. The engine was anything but smooth running and replacing the line is a real pain. This product just isn't well engineered. Buyer beware as this is an MTD product which does not have a good reputation for quality products or service."
1,"Didn't run, finicky, worthless","After going to get the special gas required; and following the ten steps required before every start; and holding down the throttle for the required 60 seconds before actual use - this thing sputtered and died with each attempt to get it past half choke. After letting my shoulder recover and trying again it wouldn't start at all.Looking at the number of bad reviews here, ""Troybilt"" (or whatever shoddy manufactuerer wears the Troybilt name) should never have let this product out. It makes me suspicious of all their products."
4,Pretty earring for the price.,This is a nice earring for the price. It's not burnished like white gold -- a little silvery shiny - but will do nicely when dressing for a dinner occasion or lending them to your teenager.
4,pretty,"These earrings are very pretty, and they arrived quickly from the seller. I plan to wear them at my wedding!"
4,Very pretty,"Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5"" Long Drop Earrings Made with Swarovski, was purchased for Christmas present. Believe it will be enjoyed."
3,The Dumb Ox,"G. K. Chesterton in one of the most redundant biographers that I've ever come across. The outline of the book and its overall message is quite sketchy and not at all organized. Mr. Chesterton just throws words at the reader in a very monotone and uninspired kind of way although his passion for the Saint, judging by the book itself, seems deep; almost as if he wished he could have met the Saint. Most of the book is just praising of Thomas Aquinas rather than information and facts about the man's life. I read the bio in it's entirety and learned more from a simple article posted on the wikipedia. In other words, G. K. Chesterton's biography on Saint Thomas Aquinas was a valiant attept at trying to tell, rather that show, the world what an important figure the Saint really was. Again, in other words, the book was a waste of time."
3,Garelick Bracket,"The bracket is well built; strong enough to handle my 8 hp 4 stroke and the up and down operation is excellent; done so with ease, no straining. With a motor lock on the motor screw mounts there is limited space between the handle and the lock....otherwise all is good.-Mike"
2,Only Eyewitnesses are Valid,"Here we are trying to rewrite history 2,000 years later. I think that if the main point of this book were true the easiest way to prove it valid is searching in history people that said that Jesus was an invention of this family or any other family. In trials only the eyewitnesses can testify; where are the testimonies of people of the same epoch saying what Atwill are trying to prove 2,000 years later??? If you don't have an eyewitness testimony you don't have nothing. No matter how attractive could be the drama, it is just that: a drama in the mind of a person that think that Jesus could not be GOD.Dr. Ismael Gonzalez-Silva"
3,Ergonomic Keyboard,"Keyboard takes getting used to. If you hop to other machines with a regular keyboard, you need to adjust back to using a regular keyboard.I believe it has minimized the pain that was starting in my wrist (reason for trying keyboard).The only problem that I had was with order. The description said (pack of 5) but only received one keyboard in a huge box. Upon research I received numerous reponses from Amazon on what ""pack of 5"" was; including this item was one keyboard with five USB components (totally did not make sense to me). I was expecting to received five keyboards. When they finally confirmed the order, there were no keyboards left so I was refunded for four keyboards. Resolving the order shortage took a lot of my time. Amazon said that they would check on what ""pack of 5"" meant and call me back but I ended up having to call them when I did not receive a reply. Credit for items not shipped was received timely."
3,Amazon Warehouse Deals is a mess,"Paid for ONE (5)FIVE pack of keyboards, and received ONE (1) single keyboard. Amazon warehouse deals can't tell the difference between 1 and 5? Too much trouble for them to correct the order; instead must send back for a refund."
2,Another disappointment,"I keep reading Julianne Maclean's books because she has written a few gems but this was not one of them. Why does she feel the need to write these characters over and over again? Almost every book its the heroine who is so desperatly infatuated and chasing after the rake, who has emotional issues. There was nothing engaging or entertaining about this book. How many times do we have to read about secret masquerades and ballrooms? It's so boring and predictable."
5,Great Book!!,"I was taking an internet class this semester and the book I received from the bookstore just wasn't answering the questions I needed answered. I searched and searched and ran across this book, but it was $40 on another website. So I looked on Amazon.com and saw it for almost $3. I was so shocked. I didn't believe it was the book until I received it. I was so happy because I was able to complete ALL my assignments by using this book. To put more icing on the cake...I received an A in the class! Thank you for selling this book at such a cheap price."
4,A great Thrash metal classic!,"The second effort by this band is a little bit beter production wise. The songs are technical, and lyrically challenging. There is more eery guitar harmonies and melodies that give it a sort of melancholic power metal vibe at certain points. Again it's a perfect mix of west coast thrash metal, and the best of the oldschool hardcore scene. All in all there is nothing here that didn't dissapoint me. I still have the cassette, ha!"
1,"Oh, those wacky gardeners! I think I'm going to be sick....","Not the book to get if you're seeking to learn much about composting. Sure, there are some tidbits but overall the info presented is the basic stuff available free in pamphlets at garden stores, via internet, libraries, municipal fliers, etc., such as ratio of greens to browns.The book is intended to be humorous and I suppose it may be to the ya-ya sisterhood crowd. The humor leans heavily on goofy puns and wacky scenes such as dressing up in whimsical costumes and performing ceremonies to stop bees from stinging. Tee-hee!Oh, and they also do a compost ""rap"", ha ha! what a hoot!If you still want it I'd give you mine but it's stewing in the compost pile."
3,Jump Ring Opener,Great opener for the price but if you have a variety of jump rings to open then I suggest you look further. On one side the slats are the same size.
3,fits omly certain carts!,"This cover fits Sam's club carts more or less,It does not fit Wegmans or Target carts-the seat is too deep, the handle is too far to be covered.However, I like it. It has nice pillows on the sides, so the baby can't reach the sides of the cart."
5,My daughter loves the grocery store now.,"My daughter likes grocery shopping so much better now that she can sit up in her comfy little cart seat rather than being stuck in her baby car seat. It's true that it is not big enough for to cover the handle on the bigger carts at some stores, including our regular grocery store, but it still gives her a soft little place to sit so I don't mind at all."
2,Seemed great until we used it and saw what else was out there...,"The first few times we went out to smaller stores with tiny carts, it seemed great. The we went to the grocery store: it's so small it won't stretch over the entire seating area to fasten on the handle. It doesn't cover the sides of most grocery store carts either, so my son was chewing on every exposed surface, defeating the purpose of the stupid thing. The pillows are a nice touch, but overall the cover is thin and uncomfortable and baby can't lie down comfortably (or at all) with this one. We are getting a BuggyBaby cover to replace this useless thing. The verdict? Cute but don't bother unless you only shop at very tiny stores with very tiny carts."
3,Entertaining,"If you are looking for a light, entertaining read, go no further. I read through this book in one sitting and the plot and characters were engaging enough to keep me turning the pages. The hero isn't your typical alpha-male and his interactions with the heroine were sweet. The romance was strictly PG but the author managed to keep it interesting and compelling without going into too much detail.The thing that bothered me, though, was the hero's childishness, especially at the end. I realise that a little bit of deceit was necessary on his part to drive the plot but it seemed cruel after a while. The 'fairy god-servant' device also got stale quickly.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, light read."
1,fell apart,"This bag self destructed in abput 2 months. Hardly carried anything in it except a few work items..didn't even carry a lap top in it. First the zipper broke, then another zipper shredded, then the hook for the strap snapped. A total waste of money....unless you want to throw%60.00 away every 2 months....I'n going back to Lands End"
1,You SUCK,"You guys STOLE your material from the DEAD former member DOUG HOPKINS. Shame on all of you. Burn in hell. Write your own tunes, you idiots."
2,Am I the only one who didn't like this product?,"The pr$ce was right so I bought it. I loved the idea of a wet/dry shaver. How nice to quickly go over a ""missed spot"" w/a dry razor. But I found that it does NOT shave closely like a razor, wet or dry. I tried lathering and taking longer and still, no close shave. Used a razor today and ahhh, there's that close shaved, baby smooth feeling again. The key is to switch to a new razor every 4-5 days. Would love to keep the product if I could get the same results. Any hints are welcome. BTW I am not that hairy, and the armpits were a pain to shave w/this product. Yes, the bikini pop up was nice. But overall, did not get the same experience."
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this product after reading other people's reviews on this site. I was very disappointed, mainly because it did not shave close AT ALL. I felt like I needed to go over each area several times and it still did not shave close. And, I am not even hairy at all. I am going back to disposable razors!! I would return this, if I could. Don't waste your $$$$!"
4,"Fun, but not the best in the series","This book is good, but not as funny as some of Wendelin's other books. Sammy is a strong character, as always, and I especially liked the way the teacher goes nuts after her bird disappears, Sammy feels quite guilty about that. It was a very pleasant read, but the mystery part itself wasn't all that compelling, and for me it wasn't laugh-out loud funny like the Art of Deception, but it's definitely at par with other Sammy Keyes books. It features a strong moral in terms of sticking up for what's right even when it's the tough choice. Wendelin's Shredderman series is hilarious and Flipped is also a really good book, whereas this book features some fun pirate talk but not much in the way of the funny and embarrassing teen romance scenes that cropped up in the Art of Deception, and the mystery bit is never tense or particularly exciting. Four stars is maybe even a bit much for this book, 3.5 is probably more like it."
4,"Like all good seafare, it is raw and well seasoned.","As a former qualified diesel submarine Torpedoman in the `50s who made a WestPac run and who, in the `70s and `80s, was a civilian Special Agent with US Naval Intelligence assigned in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Iceland, in, I can say, that I have Been there, Done that!"" The authors have apparently been there, and done that also. Many of the tales told, the events related, and the places mentioned (or at least similar ones) are all too real and still vivid in this reviewer's memory. On reading ""Spindrift"", they will become a part of yours also. Down to earth from the heart writing that ""tells it like it is"" (old memories not withstanding)."
5,Terrific collection of sea-stories. You'll love 'em all.,"These stories are wonderful examples of real-life events seen by three brothers gifted with the ability to see humor and truth in everyday activity. They reflect the realism and intensity in extremely serious military situations that resolve into laughter in spite of all the pressure to ""do it by the book."" The stories are short and sweet, perfectly crafted, and they illustrate the great values and pleasures that come from a life in the service. Give yourself a treat and buy this book. At the end of it, you'll wish it was twice as long!"
5,Surprised to be the first!,"""Roll to Me"" is a great song; I'm surprised no one has written a review of it yet! I've recorded it almost seven times in the last three years."
3,Lens adapter for Canon S5-IS,I ordered a Digital Concepts Lens adaptor but was shipped an Opteka brand adaptor. Maybe it is the same thing with a different name. The Opteka has quite a lot of play where it mounts to the camera which makes it feel less secure and cheap. A 58mm filter mounts easily to the adaptor so functionally the adaptor works. I am going to look around for another brand adaptor that fits better.
3,ADAPTER,"ADAPTER WHEN INSTALLED HAS SOME MOVEMENT, NOT SNUG ENOUGH, INSTALLED IT ON MY CANON S3 IS, WENT ON VACATION, I LIKE IT I CAN CHANGE FILTERS PLUS IT ALSO PROTECTS THE LENS."
2,reasonable price. Fit just OK - a little play,"Price was way cheaper than the Canon prodcuct. Fits the camera, but is a little loose -- a little play in the connection."
5,Where did this come from??,"I agree with the reviewer below - this release of a single (from Mercury Falling) containing no less than three previously unreleased songs is stunning. The Pirates' Bride is a new favorite of mine, though very anonymous because of its' rareness. Lullaby is beautiful, and the ""upbeat"" feelgood-song named Twenty Five To Midnight (contained on the European-release of Mercury Falling) rocks good as well! Great disc, yes, with hidden treasures - recommended!"
3,Another Good Refernece,The Craft is also another very good reference guide to help anyone serious in wicca to gain information about the sabbats and constructing rituals. The poetics are exceptional. A MUST read.
4,An introduction - the Dorothy Morrison way.,"I like Dorothy Morrison's books very much, and I do like The Craft (along with The Craft companion). The Craft is a very good 101 book, great for those that haven't read Scott Cunningham's ""Wicca"" or have no interest in reading that. Although I prefer Cunningham's 101 book over this one, The Craft is still very well-written with many exercises, rituals and such for really delving into Wicca. I didn't see any mention of raising energy (which is important) and the index left much to be desired.Something that I really liked about the book was that Morrison also gave example rituals to perform on each full moon, with it's name and historical information - not just slapped-together sabbat rituals.As I said earlier, it is a good ""101"" book, but it should not be the only one that someone refers to when wanting to walk down the path of the Old Ways."
3,"Not bad, but too many errors","This is a relatively good cookbook approach. It gets you started quickly with hands-on exercise development as you read the text. The review exercises and case problems are good, because they step you through a little at a time and in some cases show what you should be getting as a result. However, the type-in code and the text itself have lots of errors throughtout the book, so if you're unsure what to do, and can't discern where the text is wrong, that could be a show-stopper. For such an expensive book it should have been better edited.Also, Patrick Carey does very little to explain why things are the way they are. It's just, ""Do this, then that. See the result?""You'll need another book to have the ""aha"" moments that give you insight into XML. I highly recommend ""XML Companion"" by Neil Bradley."
3,Moving / Greased Lightning,If you are a Richard Pryor fan then Moving is funny and a good movie to watch and enjoy. Greased Lightning is a movie to show just how far we have come and still need to go.
1,NOT WORTH A READ,"I read an older HC copy of this book but I couldn't get into it. The characters were too dark, and weird, and parts of the story didn't make sense to me. I'm glad it was only a little over 200 pages. I paid $1 for it at a local grocery store for charity. I'm glad that I didn't pay full price for it. Save your money."
2,"Strong midrange, booming bass, thin treble","Purchased to replace stock Ford speakers. Bass is much more prominent than the OEM speakers, to the point that we don't add bass from the EQ. Midrange seems similar to the OEM speakers. But the highs are very thin and quiet, to the point that we need to equalize the highs up quite a bit. If these speakers are to be used standalone, I'd suggest looking at different units with a better tweeter. If they are to be used as midrange speakers in a combined system, they'd be great."
3,"Not bad, but repetitive","I enjoy TLC a lot, so I bought this import and found it to be alright, but really repetitive. But the original proves just how skilled TLC is when it comes to making smooth r&b with a great beat."
5,A Must Have!,"This video is one of the best art films I have viewed in a long time, awesome! This film shows Roy at work and the viewer is introduced to the complexity behind the art of Roy Lichtenstein. This is a must have for any artist or art teacher who is interested in modern art and one of the greatest American artists ever!!"
5,"The first year is a unique DVD about the Airbus ""A-380"" !","I ordered this DVD from ""Airutopia"" a while ago and the whole thing has been filmed in a very professional way. The narration part section also adds a lot of amazing information and any aviation aficionado or anybody curious about how this huge plane is being prepared from a technical point of view for it's future missions will be delighted by ""Airbus A-380 ""The first year"" !"
2,Disappointing.,"I love A380 but I don't like this DVD. This DVD contains unique footage that you can't find elsewhere, but it's pretty boring. Editing is quite primitive. Camera work so primitive (like a home movie beginner), too, that it makes you feel dizzy when watching some scenes. I don't think it's worth $25."
3,Thin,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it is relatively short. Lohr profiles a dozen or so software pioneers. Why does he pick some and not others? He seems to have no insight whatsoever into his topic, giving stiff press-release type comments from his subjects. Also, the book does not flow smoothly or logically. Editing was poor - there are numerous typos and many repetitions."
5,It's great! This Cd has made me be a huge van of Sheryl Crow,I think that you should by Cant Cry anymore. Sheryl Crow is the artist in this CD. This CD is probably one of my most favorite Cds. I love it!!!! Bye this CD today!
1,Dissapointed,"In short by the time I got to the end of the book I didn't feel I had been taken anywhere. The story switches back and forth between the characters several times through each chapter, keeping you up to date on what they are doing, but by the time you get to the end of the book nothing has actually happened. The reader is no closer to the next step of the story than before beginning the book. It was a very frustrating and unfulfilling book."
5,I love these anchovies!,These are so convenient - one jar is perfect for a large salad. I love the quality and the packaging as well.
5,great product,I revieveed the blue ray mpovie in grood condtion and cant waut to see it I love Walter and John great movie
5,So funny!,"Bought this movie for my Mom and Dad who seen this movie in the theater, they were so happy! It took about 5 minutes from when I first gave it to them to start watching it! Hilarious movie! Very original movie! Love that the sequel came with it. If you love to laugh, I would recommend this movie 100%!"
1,audio doesn't work on the grumpy old men disc,This package was delivered in a timely manner and the grumpier old me part works great. Grumpy old men doesn't have the audio working correct at all. For most of the movie you have no audio but then it will pop on for two seconds extremely loud.
3,Grumpy old men,It took a very long time to get here. It was not packaged very well the movie was grumpy old men
5,The Best !!!,it is just too bad time could not intend for this saga to continue. It is thee Best of viewing!
1,Grumpy Old Consumer...,"I knew one day Warner Bros. would put these great movies in Widescreen and thus, help me add them to my shelves. But today is not that day! After seeing this advertised as Widescreen on this website and the Warner Home Video website, I was beside myself with glee and anticipation. I went to four different stores in California, and found that each time I went to purchase, the back of the DVD read, Includes full screen version. Confused I bought it anyway. Thinking maybe the back was a mis-print? Or maybe it meant, includes widescreen and full screen. I was wrong... On both counts! So when I contacted Warner Home Video, and nasty Nurse Ratched answered the phone and told me that ""If I didn't buy it on their website then what did they care that it was being advertised wrongfully"", I knew that these movies would not find a place on my DVD shelves anytime soon.Buyer beware! This is not only being advertised wrongly but, no one will care once you purchased it!"
4,Funny,The movie was as funny as advertised. Really enjoyed the comedy and it still had a very well thought out plot.
4,This is no Lemon!!,"I bought this CD about a year ago because I wanted ""Open Up Your Eyes"". My eyes were opened. I frankly didn't know what to expect with Tonic, seeing I had not listened to any of their music except the above-mentioned song. I was pleasantly surprised to hear such great songwriting and musicianship.If you're expecting ""Open Up Your Eyes"" parts 2, 3, etc. you won't find it here, and that's a good thing. The band shows a lot of different styles on Lemon Parade and once you give it a listen or two you will count this release as one of your favorites. I went out and bought Sugar soon after and found it to be very good as well, although Lemon Parade, in my opinion, is a little better."
4,Strong debut!,"Now it's 10 years since this album appeared as Tonic's debut.This albums is fantastic, The singer has a ""Ed Kowalczyk"" style but as much as I love Live, this guy has better set of pipes!!Musically wise this album is great, beautiful guitar arrangements, nice ballads and power tracks too.If you like grunge and alternative music you'll love TONIC..."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Not much to be excited about on this one. The first two tracks (Open Up Your Eyes, Casual Affair) are radio friendly fluff, the rest of the album is almost unlistenable. Don't waste your time."
4,Great blend of alternative and classic rock,"If you mixed equal parts Zepplin, Deep Purple, Counting Crows and Husker Du, you would end up with a pretty fair description of Tonic. This is a solid album, containing both hard rocking songs like Casual Affair, Mountain, Thick, Wicked Soldier (best song on the cd), and ballads such as Lemon Parade and My Old Man. I originally bought the album for the two singles Open Up your Eyes and If You Could Only See, but after a few times through the cd, I decided they are probably among the weaker tracks on this disk. I would have given this album five stars, but for the fact it tends to get a bit tiresome more quickly than a truly great album - possibly because Emerson Hart's vocals, while quite decent, are nonetheless rather non-distinctive. Good liner notes containing full lyrics - this seems to be a vanishing trend, unfortunately. Overall a solid album that won't generate many regrets from purchasers."
3,Victrola,"Definately music from that era.Sounds like it is a victrola playing.If you like that,it is a good cd"
4,Great part at a great price.,"Installed easily and fit just as described. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they ride a little stiff, but overall feel is good."
5,I can relate to the stories in this book...,"My children are 5, 4 and 2 and I can relate to many of the hysterical stories in this great book. I bought this book for myself because I thought it would be fun to read about adventures (misadventures) of other parents. When I got the book, I thought that it would make a great baby shower gift, too. Share this book with anyone who loves children - they'll thank you for it!"
4,Armchair Parent,"Put the kids to bed, and hide under the covers with your spouse, or just yourself, and a copy of the Misadventures of Moms. Or take a break from folding laundry, curl up on the loveseat with Misadventures of Moms and become an Armchair parent. This book is a howler. You can pick it up, put it down, leaf through looking for the stories that tickle you most. In this book there is something for everyone who's ever raised or loved a kid."
5,Still laughing.....,"I finally finished the book, and am now ready to pass it on to my husband! He's wondered why I've been giggling for three days straight! While reading the book, I have been totally engrossed in the true-to-life content! I encourage all parents (and parents-to-be) to partake in this wonderful adventure into parenthood. It is totally enlightning and worthwhile reading!Warmest regards,Brenda Ball"
2,Er... What?,"I have no idea why this book has been so highly rated. The instructions are ridiculously overcomplicated and there seems to be no real rhyme or reason to the order of the sections. I get lost in the walls of text the author has given me in lieu of step-by-step photographic instruction. This book came highly recommended, but I am much happier with my other purchase, ""Bookcraft"" by Heather Weston - even if that book leaves a little to be desired, it's much more user-friendly and easier to follow them this one. I am not impressed at all and will probably never use this book, unfortunately."
4,"Looks good to parents, not yet for 2-year old twins","This is a well-designed/built toy that combines 5 activities into a very small footprint and is not too expensive (compared with buying all 5 different toys separately) - so it's everything the condo-living parents wanted for their 2-yr old twin girls. The only issue so far is that the kids don't seem to be interested in it. But maybe they will in another year, when they reach the minimum recommended age for this toy ..."
3,Yellow? What yellow?,"I am downgrading this to 3 stars because potential buyers need to know.I've never used these coated bulbs before, and was expecting a very yellow light output. It has a yellow ""tint"" to the light, at best. It is plenty bright, so it is satisfactory as a driving/fog lamp, but if you are expecting European yellow (amber) light output, you're better off with a Yellow lens or perhaps a Yellow film to cover your lamp.This bulb is not the ""classic"" yellow that you may be looking for.Also, make sure that your wiring harness and your driving/fog lamp film (if applicable) can handle the 100W bulb's heat output.Just be aware of these points, and you can live with them, you'll be pleased with the usual Hella quality."
3,Love the chants but not the new age sound,"I bought this to hear Buddhist chants after a trip to Japan where I was enchanted by hearing them. This disappointed me in that many of the chants have an overlay of new age music. Some people might like this, but I don't. I think the chants stand by themselves and don't need ""improving."" Not all the chants on this album have the overlay, though the majority do. In one or two cases, the new age sound goes well with the chant and is acceptable. But in other cases, the music gets in the way. I have another album, Buddhist Drums Bells & Chants, which is just the plain chant recorded at various temples. It's more to my liking."
3,Where's the beef?,"Don't get me wrong, I'm just as happy as the next guy that TF episodes are finally on DVD. But 3 episodes per DVD?? C'mon, considering the total lack of extras, you could fit 6 episodes on this DVD.If it wasnt for Amazon.com's great 'below list price' discount, I'd pass...Look out, the Rhino is (over)charging! Heheh"
3,Digital Electronics: A Practical Approach (7th Edition),Book works well in a classroom format when you have time to go over the various waveforms. The Instructor package has several useful items.
1,"Horrific, all too horrific.","The title really says it all. I couldn't even make it through this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! This would have to go on my all-time greatest mistakes list. Any movie where the guy is spanking the monkey and the monkey breaks off (yes, I did say that.) is not worth owning or even seeing."
5,George Strait is always great entertainer,"If you like George Strait singing you will enjoy this movie. It was of particular interest because I recognized the dance hall Kuntry Klub where I danced a few times. I also recognized Main St. in Maypearl, TX. The rodeo arena was a bit small; but they never said it was the National Finals Rodeo,"
1,Wrong formatting,The DVD is not formatted to be run at a Playstation 3 here in Norway. I cannot watch the movies!!!
4,Honeysuckle Rose is cut,"I loved Honeysuckle Rose when I saw it in 1980, and I love it again now. It would have given it 5 stars, but after viewing the DVD, I realized that my favorite song and scene was cut. Why would they cut Amy Irving singing ""If You Want Me to Love You, I Will"" from the DVD? I've read all of the reviews here on Amazon. Didn't anyone else notice?"
5,dvd,"It came in about nine days. It was a gift so I never opened it and watched it, so I hope it was the real thing :) But the cover kinda felt cheap. But hey it was cheap and came fast. all good."
1,CHEAP AND EASY TO BREAK,CHEAP AND EASY TO BREAK. EVERY CHEAP PRODUCT. MOST LIKE MADE IN CHINA. PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT. ITS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY
2,"Well...you get what you paid for, I guess!","Like the title said, ""...you get what you paid for..."" This product is useful, but when it really counts, the pins get bent out of shape. The housing is made of really cheap plastic and the pins (as mentioned) are made of really cheap metal. But, for a couple dollars, there's not much to complain about but review this item as is. So, for short term use, GET IT...long term, GET A BETTER ONE!I hope this review helps."
5,Very easy to use,"I prefer to do it myself, first, save a few bucks, save time. Bought the seiko watch online, need to adjust the strap, but jcpenny, Macy would not do it since it is not bought from them. Check how to adjust the strap, decide to do it myself, just $2.99, and a few minutes, it is done. Very easy to use, check the arrow on the strap, align the pin, easy to push them out."
3,Bean Counter,Flimsy but it works. You must be patient. You must align the watch. If it does not align turn the watch over. What do you have to lose for $3.00.
5,It Worked !!!,"The SE Watchband Link Remover worked, just like it was advertised.I bought my wife a new watch for her birthday, the band was way to big for her wrist which she said, "" it's nice "" with that cold disappointed look. I ordered this tool and wow, in a few minutes it was done. Now she wears it all the time, it fits perfectly, see loves it.Thank you,John"
1,"Terrible, cheaply made, broke on first use","This device seemed pretty easy to use, but the first time I tried to use it the plastic snapped, rendering it useless. I'd seen mixed reviews on this so I also ordered a different watch sizing kit - thank goodness. This thing was a waste of money."
1,Just for girls,"I haven't working out much so my wrist got smaller. My watches are men watches, so it doesn't fit on the tool.So if your watches have slim bands, it might do the trick."
4,Handy item,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much. However, if you are gentle with the cheaply made product you will be able to remove links with ease. It only took me a few moments to remove two links from my Croton watch. It now fits much better."
1,Cheap piece of junk,It the metal prod bent within minutes. I am ordering a more expensive one. This was a total waste of money.
2,Was not good for me,"Ok I am sure that this product is fine for someone that knows what they are doing! That being said I would advise you to take your watch to a jewler for sizing and link removal if you are a novice (like me). The repair to my tag after I messed it up trying to use this was around 100 dollars in parts alone (that is with me going against the full bracelet replacement that was recommended to me which would have been 500 dollars)So if your experienced at Link Removal then this tool should work fine for you, Else I would not recommend using this."
4,Works Great!,"item arrived as pictured and worked great! the watch i was adjusting was too wide to fit laying down, so i positioned the band in the vertical 'hold' slot, removed the adjustment tool and used it from above to 'pop' the pin out ... it was simple and effective to change my band using this item!"
1,do not recommend,Tried using it to remove a pin the first time and the metal pin broke off the device. Now I can't remove the old pin to try another spare pin in the device. I would not recommend this plastic device to anyone.
2,Not good quality,Hard to line up. Hand to hold in your hand. Hard to use on a table. Does not line up well....this thing is good if you intent to use it once but if you want to change several bands forget it...go to a jeweler!
2,Not that good,"The needles in the front are soft so wheneveer I wanted to remove the watchband link, they broke one by one. Finally I used a scissor to remove the watchband..."
3,Cannot complain at the price.,"The tool is crude but functions perfectly well. It is hard to find fault when it cost $2.95 with free delivery. If you are considering buying one of these for your own occasional use, this one should be as good as any. If you need one for every day use you probably need to keep looking. One last note, some watch straps have extremely small components, make sure your eyes and fingers are up to the job and also work on a piece of cloth ideally placed on a tray on top of a table. I learned this the hard way and spent an hour on my knees searching till I found the tiniest shim."
4,inexpensive handy tool,"This tool worked perfect. The links come out with easy when the item is line up to the pin in the watch band and the screwdriver is tightened to force the pin out the other end. The tool doesn't include instructions, but how to videos can be easily found on the internet using a search engine.This is an inexpensive handy tool anyone can use and it pays for itself in 1 use since it is way cheaper than taking your watch or link bracelet to a store to get adjusted. Everyone should own one."
1,remover tool,"very cheap, need to buy a better one, doesnt open wide enough for big bands, handle is very very cheaply made"
4,Awesome Product,It is very good and easy to use.It can be used for all kindsof watch sizes.It is portable as well.
2,Low quality,"Pins break easily, and you get what you paid for. This is low quality and will not last. Better invest in something more durable for the long run."
3,Ok,"THis book give you some views about turnarounds. If you want to learn about turnarounds this is a book that can help. I suggest reading this and a more "" hands on"" to balance theory + pratical stuff."
1,EXP DVD-ROM 8X Travelerpccard Portable,"According to the documentation about the DVD-ROM 8X Travelerpccard Portable our laptop met all of the system requirements. After getting the DVD player installed though, we found that it would not read from commercial DVDs, but would only read DVD+R's. When we tried to watch movies with the DVD+R's, the video was too slow and skipped frames. The audio was fine, but the video made it impossible to watch without getting a headache.We bought the DVD player solely for the purpose of watching DVD movies, it may be acceptable to read data, but as a movie player it is not usable."
4,Soundgarden's Superunknown Extras,"A generous four stars for this good EP. Superunknown is Soundgarden's magnum opus and is perhaps the greatest album from the ""post-grunge"" era. Soundgarden were definitely inspired by Black Sabbath, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc. and brought the best of these influences to the core of their songs. On this EP, ""Superunknown"" and ""Fell On Black Days"" are similar to the album versions. ""Jerry Garcia's Finger"" is trippy enough and funny for a couple of spins. This one is worth buying for ""She Likes Surprises"" from the International LP version and the excellent stripped-down acoustic version of ""Like Suicide"". If you like Chris Cornell singing and strumming on ""Like Suicide"", check out his rendition of ""Black Hole Sun"" on Audislave's DVD ""Live in Cuba""."
2,Keep the tools handy to retighten,"The chairs assemble easily enough (they come in 3 parts - the seat, the front legs and the back legs) - however, beware that the bolts come loose way too easily and you'll need to keep the tool handy to retighten them often. I may get out some Gorilla Glue (wonderful stuff once it foams and dries) to strengthen the structure of the chairs."
3,"Yup, It be Ok for Now","Haven't had a chance to use it yet. Will need to hone it first tho. What I disliked was the fact it came with a plastic guard to hang on your garage wall but big, bulky, and awkward if you want to take it anywhere on your person. For that reason I put out $25 and had a leatherman make me a sheath for backpackin. I hope that its longevity is greater than its appearance of being cheaply made and small brace over the top axehead."
2,Wartime Horrors With Bela Lugosi,"""Black Dragons"" (1942) mixes a few chills with its bizarre World War II espionage. The results are somewhat dull, but Bela Lugosi helps enliven the proceedings as the sinister plastic surgeon who has a few surprises in store for Japan's Black Dragon Society. A pre-Lone Ranger Clayton Moore plays the disgruntled romantic hero. Ideal for nighttime viewing, with a lurid twist ending. Another Monogram quickie from producer Sam Katzman."
2,No 1080p HDMI,"I bought this set around a year ago. I waited for Blu-Ray DVD players to come down in price thinking I would be able to view movies and content from other 1080p devices. The catch is that the TV only allows 1080p input signals through the coaxial and Firewire ports. It's HDMI and component ports will only accept a signal up to 1080i. The real problem is that most game and other content vendors push 1080p through component and HDMI. So while you will be able to see a 1080p signal when TV stations start sending out 1080p broadcast you will not be able to enjoy 1080p external content unless it's from a firewire device. I'm totally disappointed by this as I payed a lot more than $1,700.00 for this set. Mitsubitshi is playing the ""We told you it was 1080p capable but you didn't ask if the inputs were compatible"" game. Don't fall for it. Look at other products."
5,Practical stylist 8th edition,Book looked brank new. No creases from it ever been opened it appeared. Shipping was quick. It showed up earlier than expected.
4,Nice but creates static,"I have had one of these for a long time. The product holds up well and works well too, but it does create static so I've switched to a brush iron."
4,Great Styler!,"I ordered this styler to replace a similar Conair styler that I've had for years. What I like about this styler: the ""teeth"" and base are of a ""rubber"" like material that lightly grips your hair so the hair easily winds around the base without slipping through. The newer Conair model I tried to replace my old had bristles like a hair brush that just couldn't grab enough of my thick hair to wrap around. It's also very lightweight. It has a button to ""unwind"" your hair after you wind it up that works quite well. Overall, a great product!"
2,Not worth your time or money,"It is very obvious that Midway spent most of their time and money on graphics and marketing. The gameplay in Blacksite Area 51 is absolutely terrible and it is evident very early on. The flaws are so extensive that I won't waste my time or yours listing them, but if you are looking for a quality first person shooter with a lot of content, run away from this game.The only reason I opted for 2 stars vs 1 is because the visuals and boss fights are impressive at times, but not enough to warrant a recommendation."
2,"Run of the mill FPS, not worth the money","I just finished the campaign in 6 hours, and boy am I glad I didn't spend the money to buy this game (it was a gift). 5 years ago, the game might have been good, but in today's market, with plenty of FPS games to choose from, this game is very average and not worth the price they charge for it."
3,"Interesting read, but...","I give this book three stars because it is basically fun and entertaining. However, much of the speculation about Franklin's elaborate hoax is based on reading between the lines in letters that Franklin wrote, or in just analyzing his over-all personality. One has to wonder how accurate this approach is several centuries after the fact. If you have more time, I would suggest reading one of the books about Franklin's over-all scientific career instead of this book, or maybe along side this book."
2,"Good words of wisdom, HORRIBLE production of book",The book was not cut right when it was bound. The rectangles on most pages are totally crooked and it is not professionally done at all- very disappointed in the quality of the book compared to the first edition of Life's Little Instruction Book.
3,Generally good except for one...,"This is an entertaining enough book with a mix of cheesy sentiments, some cliches but overall good messages to live by,...except for No. 433: ""Have a friend who owns a truck."" Seems a bit shallow and deceptive to befriend someone solely for times when you need to move or haul something away. Ever hear of U-Haul or Ryder?"
2,Good Advice tainted with Party Dogma,"Lion's share of advice is useful, but ""reading the NY Times to stay informed - finding another way to prove manhood other than shooting defenseless animals - learn Spanish as 35% will be speaking it"" is nothing more than feel-good, leftist claptrap that fronts for considerably more sinister intentions (regardless if the authors of the book are aware of it or not). Perhaps these and other ""instructions"" of this nature could be added to another book with the more appropriate title ""101 Things You Should Do If You're A Socialist""."
4,interesting book for Romanovphiles,"A beautifully produced slipcovered volume of Nicholas's own watercolored renderings of his personal jewelry, of which he apparantly had a lot of (I guess that's a necessity of being tsar-emperor). The real treat, however, are the family photographs, many of which are previously unpublished. If your a serious Nicholas and Alexandra collector, this is a must have."
3,OK but not a quite Gibson,"I have had mine about 7 years now. So have had plenty time to play and think about it:Pros: Beautiful Guitar (mine is natural and gets better looking each year), Maple gives this guitar massive sustain, Nice inlays especially in the head, good sound with right amp.Cons: Needs better pickups (don't know what they are but planning on changing them to pros someday), inlays in neck have some gaps between abalone and mop just not matched good, tone knobs don't do much of anything for either pickup, pickup select switch is very cheap, pick guard buzzed and needed tweaking, tuners do not hold so guitar needs tuning after every song (especially when bending strings or playing hard). Action is really too high for me, but I prefer Gibson SGs low action.Would I buy again, probably not. Save your money up and get a Gibson. Someday I will replace with a Gibson, but until then it is the next best thing, despite its issues. Guess I am just a GIBSON man!"
1,regret buying,Buying this DVD was a waste of our money. Yes the girls are pretty but their all FLAT. The one blonde with somewhat large breasts are way fake (they look like statues!) What is it with girls when they get implants? Can't they tell when they look in the mirror that something ain't right. I don't mind implants when they look natural! The action in the movie is tame. Very Playboy like. The very reason I do not and would not recommend anything Playboy except for the magazine.
3,It's just o.k.,"I was expecting something larger and more sturdy that would sharpen small objects. This is just o.k., but really does not dothe job as I thought it would."
4,great service,i am very satisfied with amazon and the sellers i have purchased. very reliable and quick service. thanks
3,"Nice and small, but not as good as my carbide bit scissor sharpener","I like it's small light weight size - it's probably 1/50 the size of my old scissor sharpener. But the ceramic rods don't seem to sharpen my scissors very well, compared to my old carbide bit scissor sharpener. On the other hand, its so inexpensive and small, its perfect for a small survival kit."
4,Digital Photo Pro,"I thought it would be just another fancy magazine, but it is really well written and very informative. Great magazine too help broaden your photographic spectrum."
3,Disappointing,"I am a long time fan of Dean Martin. However, this CD includessongs I have never heard before. Also songs that I would never dream Mr. Martin would record. What happened to the STANDARDS?"
2,Faulty pockets,"The length is good but the pockets don't stay put in these shorts.Unfortunately, I am too lazy to sew them down so have to live with them."
1,"Pocketec Pockey DataStor USB 2.0 Portable Hard Drive (60GB, Titanium)","Pocketec Pockey DataStor USB 2.0 Portable Hard Drive (60 GB, Titanium)The product does not look like the photo, though that is not a big deal. It is an 80GB instead of a 60GB which also is not bad, just suspicious. I was able to use it on my laptop, though I could not use it on my desktop, both Mac platforms. I tried to install it, though it was supposed to be plug and play, but to no avail. Nothing I did including reformatting, allowed my desktop to 'find' the hard drive. I have in the past used a competitor's hard drive and have replaced this with the proven dependable product and it works first time, every time."
1,Don't waste the money!,"This was supposed to be a great thing for me since I found out recently that I am allergic to two types of dust mites. However, it was difficult to put on the bed, and once it was on, it made a lot of noise. The biggest deal breaker for me though is that I have fibromyalgia, and need to keep a low temperature in my room to be able to get good sleep. This protector retains body heat like nobody's business. Both my husband and I woke up many times throughout the night soaking wet with sweat, and of course, it made the bed clammy and gross to sleep in. Last night I took it off, put my old protector(fits like a sheet, isn't meant to keep dust mites out) and guess what? I slept the whole night through. No sweating, and no overheating. Bottom line? Don't waste your money on this. Save up for a really nice protector that is breathable and doesn't retain heat. I know I am."
1,Not that happy with this product,"I've had other dust mite barrier covers before but this one is quite hard and crinkly and very noticeable under the sheets. My poor husband actually said he feels like he's laying in a hospital bed... I assume it is keeping out the bacteria etc., but it's not pleasant to sleep on!"
2,Not very sturdy!,This allergen mattress cover is a tight fit for most of today's deep mattresses but that can be a good thing. It was difficult to get on the mattress but I was able to do so. The problem was that once I got it on I tried to zip up the last part and the zipper broke on the first try. I had just spent a lot of energy getting it on the mattress and I didn't want to go through that again so I just duct taped it up at the broken zipper end. Not a great solution but I am hoping that dust mites cannot get through duct tape. In retrospect I wish I had spent a few more dollars and got one that would have held up better. I emailed the company about the problem and they emailed me back that they would let the manufacturer know but they did not offer any compensation to me. I guess I could have taken it off and mailed it back so I should not be surprised.
5,buy this record,This is not just the most amazing punk record ever recorded. Itis the greatest thing ever laid down on tape. EVER. I pity who doesn'tbuy it. END
3,Good but biased,"I read this book because I was looking for a balanced review and analysis of the 2000 election. It's possible this is the most balanced account at this time, but I still detected bias.I give the authors credit for supplying footnotes with citations to back up their facts or to give credit to other analyses they cite.However, I think a lot was left out about the 2000 election, mostly negatives about George W. Bush. The book is thorough in describing the defects in Al Gore's personality and campaign, but gives Bush kind of a pass.There is no mention of the push-polls that Bush used against McCain. There is no mention of the glee with which Bush described executions (which disturbed many of us at the time). There is no description of Bush's non-specific responses during the debates. I remember all of these things, but the book is much harder on Gore.I'm not saying that Gore doesn't deserve the criticism, but why are they being so easy on Bush?"
5,worked like a charm,worked like a charm. All my cables are the right length now and my kickdown functions again. I am very happy
3,Intermittent problem w/ router,"I bought the PC 690L RVS kit with two bases. The operation at first was fine, but developed intermittent start after a little use. It appeared that the line cord was the culprit... I could ""adjust"" the position of the line cord at the strain relief and it would start or stop. A line cord failure is extremely rare and indeed I could find no problem with the cord itself. After lots at troubleshooting and multiple reassembly of the end cap where the wires are, I discovered that the router operated fine until I tightened one of the end cap mounting screws to the end point of its travel. Thorough examination of the controller printed circuit assembly and resoldering several leads and components did not reveal any cause or resolve the problem. At this point, root cause of the problem is unknown. I just put lock-tite on the screw and tightened it to the point of shutdown and backed off half a turn. At least now the router is useful. Anyone else have similar problem?"
3,NOT made in USA,"I bought this router because it was supposed to be made in the USA. When I received it, I discovered it was made in Mexico. I want tools made in the USA, darnit!"
4,Porter Cable 690LR 1 3/4 HP Router,"Works great even under a table . Easy to adjust up and down,Just flip the lever and twist the motor to raise or lower the bit.then flip the lever back to lock the motor in place."
5,perfect router,"I'm not an expert woodworker but I found this router perfect for several projects I had going on. Powerful, smooth operation made it a joy to use. Great price, too."
3,"OK, but there are better choices","I've been using one of these (actually two) for quite a long time. I found that the tightening mechanism isn't very effective. No matter how hard you wrench down on key that tightens the base, the smooth shaft of the router motor will eventually slip and damage your work. This is especially true if you are using the unit in a router table. I have an external variable speed control, and this helps some, but the router motor will still slip in the base - usually sooner rather than later.Due to the slip problem, I recently purchased a Bosch 1617EVS. It's a night and day difference. Like trading in your old F-150 with a bad carburettor for a new fuel injected F-150. They're more the same than different, but the difference really matters.The is 690 is an acceptable but dated unit. You can do a lot better with other brands and units for similar money. Look for soft start, variable speed, and a reliable way of securing the motor in the base."
4,Porter Cable 690lr,"Bought my first Rockwell router in 1974. I own 3 of these and have jigs made to accept the base, and many specialized bases to fit this router. It's more efficient for me to set up a router and leave it for a designated job. When I'm doing a run I can have as many as 5 different routers set up. This PC has a different base lock that seems to work very easily, along with the newer style chuck that makes for easy bit removal."
5,Great no-frills router,I needed a couple of routers to go with my Leigh dovetail jig and these were the most inexpensive good name routers I could find. I bought 2 of them and set one up for tails and one for pins and just leave them set up for that one task. They perform flawlessly and now I can just grab them and know they will give me a perfect joint every time.
4,Cute Router,"I like this router, it's powerful and accurate. But the 1/2"" collet is very tight, I'm not sure if it is designed that way. The position of the power switch is badly designed. I wish there were longer screws provided for easier table mounting; I had to go to HomeDepot to search for 30 minutes for the correct screws. No tool provided for taking off the two handles, I just happen to have it (an unusually huge Allen Wrench)."
2,Quality has gone downhill,"We have many Lauri ""Crepe Rubber"" products and this, our most recent, is a much lesser quality foam/rubber than our other products. The foam is a lot less dense, and really feels like something I could purchase at a discount/dollar type store. My kids enjoy doing the puzzles, I just can't get over how cheap it feels. Not sure what happened to the quality of Lauri products but I will be wary of purchasing any others."
2,"practical size, spiral bound diary","but don't think about writing anything on it since you won't find space in the pages to do it.And be careful with the 2004 calendar in the back pages, since they forgot it's a leap year and February proudly displays 28 days. Let's hope the graphs are more accurate"
5,Classic electric blues,I don't particularly like all of Johnny Winter's music but this has some of the best electric blues I've ever heard. I consider it a must have for any good blues collection.
4,I agree!,"I'm a person that is in love with the IDEA of radio, but I almost never listen to it because most of what I can get is garbage. Aside from the minimal NPR programming that my local PBS station carries and a couple shows on my local college radio station, there is nothing that I can bear to listen to in my area. The scratchy old crooner station I used to listen to was turned into a right wing talk show station, and all of the other stations here either have obnoxious and derogatory hosts, are filled with blaring advertisements, or else play the same damn songs over and over until you begin to hate every one of them. If I had to listen to this junk every day for a year, I'd complain too - at least Ms. Vowell is funny when she does it!"
1,Le Fantome de l'Opera (French Version),"I cannot properly review this book because even though I ordered a French version of the book, the only part of it that was in French was the front cover. The book that was sent to me was entirely in KOREAN! Whomever shipped the book only looked at the cover and did not bother to see if the book was in good shape or they would have noticed the different letters which are unique to the KOREAN language! I was most disappointed, and since it would have cost more to ship the book back than it cost in the first place I did not bother!Not Happy Customer"
4,"Very helpful, but not an end all.",This book is full of wonderful ideas. My only complaint is in the recipes. Could be more variety and excitement.
3,"Good book, poor binding!","I really do like this cookbook. I make a few things from this book a lot. Some recipes are common sense... or something anyone with any kitchen know how would know how to make. But that could be a big plus for someone not so kitchen savvy. The book fell apart shortly after receiving it. The plastic rings which held the pages in place fell apart and now I keep it in a gallon size storage bag. Kind of annoying, but it is still very usable. I would buy this book for a friend and actually came here to do so, but Amazon does not offer it at this time, and the price offered by the other sellers is well above what I bought mine for on amazon."
1,Not The Right DVD in the Case,"I have seen everyTransformers and know my stuff. Don't get me wrong the 3 part series Rebirth is a fun watch. bu the DVD I ordered did NOT contain Rebirth. The case the liners all indicate Rebirth. But the DVD contains the 3 part The Ultimate Doom. The DVD says Heroes (The DVD for Rebirth says Heroes-Rebirth, but the DVD just says Heroes and 30 min per episode containg 3 episodes 90 min total). Tha package says 150 minutes. Somwhere at Rhino there is a horrible horrible error. I do not blame Amazon. This is a distribution problem. Be careful on what you are getting and make sure it is the right DVD. Rebirth is the series with the Headmasters and Targetmasters and takes place after the movie with the next generation of Transformers. The Ultimate Doom is first generation. Just be sure you get what you paid for."
2,The decline of the series,"After viewing this 3 episode DVD, I was saddened to see the apparent decline of what was once a great series. I grew up in the 80s and was a rabid Transformers fan (and still am) but these three installments were terrible. The story was much too convenient and the characters used were perhaps the weakest of both factions. While to be a true fan, you must take the good with the bad. this compilation was truly the worst. I can't wait until the box sets debut!"
1,"In SIX words ""The best 'til all are one!""","The Transformers are the best. There is no comparison. I own every toy there is and I know that all of you do too. So when I say that this dvd is one of the best, I mean it. Go and buy this dvd, as it stars the Headmasters and the Target Masters in their feature debut. I won't say much but ""'TIL ALL ARE ONE!""-I do wish that companies like Rhino would realise that 'best of...' compilations are, by and large, pretty poor. [price] (rrp) for 3 epidsodes with no extras is insulting. Release it as a season 1 box set. 3 discs, [price]. The only extras you really have to bother about is finding and getting permision to use the old toy commercials. ....L M."
5,A very convenient TV and monitor for my DVD!,I have one and i use for my office TV. This portable unit is realy convenient. I bring it to my office and my home office. Good reception and i also use it for monitor hooking up to my DVD.
5,This is a great DVD/TV combo. I receive most of the channels via an..,This is a great DVD/TV combo. I receive most of the channels via an external antenna. I have this in my personal room. I don't need to buy another separate DVD player. It's really a space saver. The DVD runs great and clear. I also hook up this to my cable TV. It can receive all channels. I strongly recommend this one.
1,Really disappointed.,"My family received this item as a gift and we were thrilled to try it. I followed the instructions to a T and it does not work. The water is leaking out of the top near the filter. So, I have a machine sitting in a puddle of water, but--the espresso grounds are still dry! Unbelievable. Of course, customer service is closed for the holidays (after all, who would need customer service for an item like this during the busiest hosting season, right?). In a nutshell--flawed product, no live customer service, and no on-line trouble shooting to solve the problem."
2,"Is this full product in box (""kit"") & ""sgl"" is only board?","Very hard to tell *exactly* what this product is - mfgrpart number would be very helpful. Good price if 1870600,not as good if 1836700. And does ""kit"" mean full package,while ""sgl"" means just the bare board (?) for [$$] less?See separate entries for ""kit"" and ""sgl"". Confusing!"
5,Be careful to get the second edition,"Unfortunately, the same produce description and reviews turn up for both editions.The product description for the kindle edition describes it as ""This revised and considerably expanded 2nd edition"". However, the book I received was definitely not the second edition: the second edition has 24 chapters, and the kindle edition had only 12 chapters.The book itself is a wonderful, unusually valuable discussion of non-classical logic, and it is a pity that the second edition is not available for kindle."
3,"Good product, but..","I've used this IDE RAID contoller in a number of systems, and it's a good product; it works ok.But... Adaptec doesn't make a 64-bit Windows driver available.If you're considering this product, I'd recommend the Highpoint RocketRAID instead. The products are nearly identical, but Highpoint provides a 64-bit Windows driver on it's web site, and the Highpoint product is cheaper if you shop around.Neither company provides much in the way of tech support."
2,Can't change boot order to boot from computer,"I bought one of these, the big problem is once you installit,it takes over you boot order, you can only boot from hard drives that are connected to the Adaptor. You can't change the boot order, to boot from a floppy or a CD first, and you will no longer be able to boot from a hard drive that is not connected to the adapator."
3,all that heaven allows and then some!!!,great little story--- wealthy widow falls for hunky gardner and my how the townnies talk!!! hudson never looked better and aggie moorehead as the neighbor is really great and she gets in some good 'oneliners'
5,The story this movie tells is really timeless -- or at least,"it seems as appropriate today as fifty years ago when it was made.This film tells the story of an oppressive social and family system that tries to control a relatively young upper-middle-class widow living in a picture-postcard-pretty New England town. She lives by herself in a lovely house whose trees are tended by Rock Hudson. She invites him to join her for lunch and a relationship begins. He's not THAT working class -- he owns the nursery -- but he marches to the tune of a different drummer, which is definitely not allowed in the circles this woman (Jane Wyman) moves in. Pressure is put to bear on her by her friends, acquaintances, and college-age children to drop this man. Her chance for happiness is endangered by the inability of these people to mind their own business.The New England setting is beautifully captured in technicolor. This is the kind of movie you could watch several times."
3,Unimpressed,"There have been better complete sets and individual recordings, which doesn't make for a very strong recommendation for this set. For the late symphonies you could do better with Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Phil, or perhaps Mravinsky's old classic recordings. The early symphonies recorded here are okay, but they're nothing special. Filler material is adequate, but again uninspiring. The Royal Philharmonic plays very well, but the positives end there."
2,"Big Book of Grilling, BBQ and Rotisserie Cookbook",Just bought a rotisserie and was hoping to find how to use it and good recipes. Only found about 4 or 5. I would've liken to know different types of meat you could cook in it and for how long you cook it for.
4,Great space opera with some science and mythology,"Great combination of space opera, science fiction, mythology, with a little split personality thrown in for good measure. I agree with the other reviewers that Weber should write a sequel to this book. The pacing is fast, characters are interesting, and the plot line keeps you guessing. A good fast read. I personally liked Path of the Fury better than the Honor Harrington books, which are basically Horatio Hornblower in space. They're enjoyable, but there's darn little science in Honor."
5,Great Space Opera With a Twist,"David Weber is writing some of the best action science fiction (Space Opera) on the market today. I totally enjoyed this book and find myself re-reading it quite often. Plot development starts slow, but when the afterburners kick in, the action is non-stop and highly entertaining. I would like to see a sequel to this book to see how the characters grow."
4,Gallantry; the battle with oneself,"Review of Libby Purves Acting UpThis is one of Libby Purves' better efforts. Military family, daughter Susie goes as officer to the Gulf, son Francis continues his career as a `drag chanteuse.' Both show the inherited family courage, whether at war or under fire from a discontented audience - he insists on facing them again with a different act. Francis also puts on what is described as his own private ENSA act when Susie's fiancé is sent home wounded from the gulf. Some sailing action for those who like that and all - or at least most - of the different characters face trials with guts and kindness. There's even a happy ending for this enjoyable read"
2,Einstein Review,"It's a pretty cool notebook, just a little smaller than I expected, I only purchased it to get to the free shipping amount!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought this book, thinking that it was disjointed thoughts from Prof. Einstein or something, and the advertising said there were only 4-left. WHAT A CROC! This is a blank writing tablet. The shipping was almost four times more expensive than the actual item. I am shocked at Amazon, and I urge you to REFRAIN FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH ALLDIRECT.COM...yeah, yeah, I know...""Buyer beware!"""
5,BEST LOVE SONG OF THE YEAR,"this is really one of the best songs in the year, alicia keys shows her talent not just singing but in the lyrics, they are very simple but very deep, very easy to understand so makes us feel the entire song...she deserves everything...I'm sure that in 20 years alicia keys will be full of tributes and stuff like that."
1,Clock Complicated,"I don't think this clock worked but I am not sure because it is so complicated and instructions were poor. I got slow response from the vendor, and had never received an RA number. They fially said I could return it but I am not sure whether I will ever get credit."
1,A Great Disappointment,"Metrokane Mighty OJ - Manual Citrus Juicer - Chrome Juice PressI could not ""bottom out"" the 1/2 orange to extract the juice, therefore leaving 1/2 the juice in the orange. The lever is not well positioned requiring an awkward position of my hand to get enough pressure on the orange to squeeze it. A great disappointment."
1,Not worth the money,Spend the extra money to get the more commercial version of this juice press. It leaves a lot of the juice in the orange and makes quite a mess as you press.
2,Defective and Annoying,"My original unit stopped working soon after getting it. It sounded its loud, shrieking alarm and then THUD!. It wouldn't power back up. I sent it in and received another unit which seemed to work fine for the next year or so. Just last night however, for no reason at all, it did the same thing. The alarm sounded, there was a thud, and it wouldn't power back on. In both cases, the TV was not on! We weren't using any audio/visual equipment and it went dead.The other annoying thing about this item is that on random occasions, when I power on my amplifier - which is NOT plugged into the HTUPS 500, the HTUPS 500 sounds its loud shreiking alarm for a few seconds. I can't seem to mute the alarm. One other thing: the lights on the front are extremely bright. Too bright for my tastes. In a dark room they light up the floor! I have to turn the unit 90 degrees so the lights face a different direction."
1,Defective merchandise,"The unit was received defective.My system was set up 60 days after receiving all the components.The Monster Cable HTUPS 500 was defective and had to be returned to the mfg, at my expense($30.00), since the shipper refused to replace."
1,"Bought 2, both dead in less than 60 days","We live in the country back a lane. When the wind blows, the power flickers.I bought 2 HTUPS 500s and an HTS 3500 filter. The HTS 3500 was plugged into a 1K UPS, then the HTUPS 500s were plugged into the HTS 3500 filter. THe first died after 42 days, the second 10 days later.On the phone, Monster told me that the HTUPS 500 isn't covered because it was plugged into another UPS. I pointed out their HTS 3500 line filter was between and if it was any good, should more than clean any interference from the 1K UPS.The last Monster products I'll ever buy."
2,So-So,"The first unit I received was bad and Amazon exchanged it very quickly (within two days) and without any hassles. The second unit I received was bad as well. I contacted Monster and they said they would exchange the second bad unit. They mailed (USPS) me a UPS label to send it back. I sent it to them and about a month later, I received a third unit. It is working great. It didn't cost me anything to exchange the bad units, but waiting over a month was not any fun."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE. YOU WILL ONLY GET 1/2 THE MATCH,I recently ordered this item. Imagine my disappointment when I opened the tape to discover that I only received the first three sets. Order from Wimbledon's web site for the complete match.
2,Definately not worth the time or price.,"If you are already familiar with surfacing this may not be a bad book, but for someone trying to learn, the applications are very weak, and presume the user has more knowledge concerning the art of surfacing than a newcomer to this area of modeling could have."
3,JoJo's is a bit of a NoNo!,I love JoJo's music. I've got the album but its just this track! I've always known JoJo as a bubbly- mainstream singer but this doesn't show it. Sorry JoJo!
4,Swivel plug is great,"Havent had a power surge yet... so not sure how it will hold up there. However the swivel plug is a great imporvement over the kinds that stick out from the wall, especially for deailing with outlets that are upsidedown."
1,Unsafe--plug melted under heavy load,"On the back of this power strip it says it's rated for 1800 watts, but I suspect they cut a few corners in their design. I ran it at about 1100 watts continuously and the plug melted after about two months. I know the wattage because I had a WattsUp meter attached. It was driving a large computer running under heavy load."
5,The rotating flat plug makes it.,"I've got a lot of electronic devices in my house, and not many electrical outlets, so power strips are a must. I always like to use the flat plug kind, so that they don't stick out behind the furniture, and I think they look nicer. Because the plug on this one rotates, instead of being fixed to the left like most of the others, it gives you even more flexibility. The added surge protection makes it great for my wireless router and computer too!"
1,Melted into our outlet within ONE week!,"Well, it looked great, nice and compact, BUT within one week, a fishy smell developed in the corner where the outlet was. When I researched fishy smells in houses, surprisingly, electrical problems came up. So, when I pulled out the plug (where the surge protector plugs into the wall,) the plug was melting and burning, and, in fact, left its metal prongs in our outlet! So, by unplugging it, our house didn't burn down (a good thing), but now we have an unusable outlet until we get an electrician in (a bad thing.) Buyer beware! Btw, we've used Belkin surge protectors for YEARS in the same outlet with NO PROBLEM; I think it's just this model/design that's faulty."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Surprising because the title and cover and subject would imply nothing if much interest. But nothing could be farther from the truth. If you like real life cowboys & Indians, extreme weather stories, everyday interesting people, history,& a true learning adventure - you must read this book!"
3,All Right,"""Great Plains"" must rate required reading for anyone interested in the Plains but unversed. It is a good introduction. Great Plains 101."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Mr. Frazier gives a pretty good litany of historical facts, but his haphazard presentation leaves one to wonder whether he was totally coherent during his two years on the plains. His style is reminiscent of someone who never quite grasped the finer points of high school English composition, and the entire description of his travels seems to reflect someone who is permanently mired in a 1960's-era drug trip. I grew up in northwestern Nebraska and am intimately familiar with the region and its history, so I expected a more thorough, considered discussion in this book. Boy, was I disappointed!"
3,disappointing,"I had high hopes when I got this book, but was disappointed by it for the most part; except for a few bright spots, it is a collection of cliches, the things we already know about the plains"
1,Junk,"I was hoping the name brand would give me a piece of mine, wrong. This thing makes the same LOUD ringing noise on my ears when using it. To make things worst, the metal casing turns real hot and burn my hand.........a hundred Dollar wasted"
5,Great bass playing,This album is great--principally because of the dynamic bass playing. No wimpy folk playing here. This bass player puts the late Entwhistle to shame. Who is this Gabe Adoff guy? Where can I find more of his stuff!!
3,Some Info for the Fans,"This may or may not be of interest to people trying to collect every episode without getting numerous duplicates. Here's what's included on this disc so you can compare with what you have:FOOD with guests Barbara Schmidt and Mario DaReyWATER with guests Sgt. & Mrs. Sylvester NelsonHAND with guests Anne Rowell and Henry JacobsHEAD with guests Jan Dietrich and John Roese(I only included the first set of guests, but the episodes usually have two or more pairs).The quality is pretty good in this collection although the chapter stops are misplaced.None of these are on the ""Best Episodes"" collection released by Shout, but 3 are also on the 30 episode collection released by Allegro (HAND is not). Hopefully we'll someday see the other hundreds of episodes that exist."
5,Ultimate Dusting Cloth!,I am a 'Cleaning Lady' and have searched for years for a 'Dusting Cloth' like this! I used to buy them. You can't find them in Stores anymore! Superb Quality! Great Performance! Highly Recommended! =)
1,First Grade Takes a Test,"I bought this book because I read other customers' good review comments. I have to say ""Don't buy it""! The book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test. With your common sense, you will be able to tell your child all about it. Plus, the price is really a rob. ... I was fooled. I hope you won't."
3,Watch out.,"Watch out for this because I wanted what was pictures however I got different colored flowers. They use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock. The flowers still looked beautiful, but I was expecting the white and pink flowers. My wife got orange and yellows one instead."
2,Keeping Our Fingers Crossed,"Great picture and definition. The 32"" screen image is somewhat smaller than that on our ancient 26"" set which we hauled back into use when....Less than six weeks after we bought this set, it died. Just plain died. When Sony finally sent a tech out (almost two weeks after we reported the problem), he called in a report saying it was dead. We'd already told them that. He ordered a new ""A Board"" and said it would take about two weeks for it to arrive. Two weeks came and went. When I called to inquire, I was informed that the part was in and the tech had been supposed to call us. The new board was installed on December 26 and we're keeping our fingers crossed. We like the set and are hoping it will last."
1,Pathetic Product and Pathetic Company,"Like many other similar Sony sets, mine is completely fried after just a couple months of service. It was randomly turning itself on and off, then would only show a black and white picture and now doesn't work at all. Sony's customer service has done nothing to help rectify the problem and has failed to follow up as they promised. I'm very displeased with Sony and will never buy another one of their products. Unless you want tons of headaches and hassles, maybe you should stay away too."
2,Gagging God and Pleading Kingdom Growth as Excuse,"Hunter knows better! Historic Lutheran faith given to him (or was it taught him?) is denied in these confessions.He places the so-termed father of CG, McGravan, in the same class as the Apostle Paul and Martin Luther. To a Lutheran, this is unthinkable!His cure for apostacy is marketing the church. This involves church change to counter cultural change.Many LCMS officials and pastors, along with prominent CG figures, recommend this book. Go figure! The leaven is alive and thriving!For my response, see my book, Testing the Claims of Church Growth."
3,Impressive but overlong,"Fritz Lang's silent crime thriller pits a government agent (Willy Fritsch) against a scheming international banker who is stealing government documents. Considered an overlooked, but crucial part of Lang's impressive canon and an important influence on the thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock; it does have some first-rate cutting and painterly images of the city's dense layering. However, (this version at least) is simply way too long. One can anticipate what is going to happen later in the film with more than hour to go. The film could easily afford to lose some where in the order of one hour of its footage. A necessary viewing for anyone interested in the work of Fritz Lang all the same."
1,Too small for the Elite 90 Dumbbell Set,"I love the dumbbells but unfortunately I was deceived by the product description that clearly says it fits ANY powerblock. For the Elite 90, the dumbbells do NOT fully fit on the stand and a portion will be hanging in the air which make it impossible to pick the higher weights without lots of moving that is not simply worth it."
1,Does not fit,"I ordered a size up based on other reviews. Still too small. I'm fairly athletic and not a fatty (6'0"" and 185lbs). I ordered the 36"" waist. The waist fits fine, but my legs can barely fit into the pants. These must be the ""slim"" fit.I've ordered the Mad Dog gear in the past and have been really happy. These pants are not what they should be."
2,The Other Van Halen Tribute,"There is a Van Halen Tribute that came out last year on Roadrunner. Although the bands aren't that well known there are very creative and cool versions of classic VH songs. The company that put the Cd out was Cherrydisc out of boston. The CD is called ""a loose interpritation of the musical genius of VH"". Get it. It rocks and it is a great party CD."
1,Techno tries to meet rock..... NOT!,"Ok, I was impressed that there was a tribute cd for Van Halen. I was also impressed at the folks who performed on this CD.However, once I plugged in the cd and heard the dance beat OVERWHELM the sound of the ""real"" performers, I was NOT impressed. This is an attempt at merging something pure(VH Rock) with something new(techno/electronica) and it just doesn't work.With all the true rockers on the CD I thought this would be an all out blitz of real Rock. It wasn't, and now I have a CD that will collect dust in my collection.My apologies to the members of Van Halen, but I'm sure they would sympathize."
4,Good music,I really like this music. Very energetic playing. Kind of a klezmer sound to some of it. Fun to listen to!
4,"The basic delta 14"" band saw","This is the same saw as the enclosed stand model, the only differense is in the stand and that the motor is 3/4hp. The open stand introduces a little more vibration from the motor than the close one does (in the closed one the motor is isolated). The other diffrence is in the horse power departament. This one has a 3/4hp and the closed stand model is 1hp. If you aren't going to do heavy resawing on hardwoods this is the band saw for you, otherwise go with the closed stand.Ps: don't even look at the other 14"" band saws...these are copies of the delta. But the quality is not the same, everything on the deltas are beter. From bigger castings, more heavely rib wheels, better guides and bigger and stronger table trunions."
3,I tried to like it....,"I really did try to like this. I love humorous pregnancy books. I tend to scare myself silly with ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and googling various pregnancy complications. I need humorous pregnancy books to balance it. I loved ""Belly Laughs"" and ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"". I hoped ""You're Pregnant!"" would be the same. It had a few funny moments in it, but I had a hard time keeping interested. It's not a bad read, but I will admit I'm glad I checked it out of the library. I had enough trouble finishing it the first time. I don't think I'd read it again."
5,A classic album by the Godfather of soul,"This vinyl disc by James Brown has not only his Top 10 hit, but several other sides that are among his best songs, such as ""I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry Cry"", ""Goodbye My Love"", ""Licking Stick"", #14 on the Top 40 charts, and ""Let Them Talk"". Brown also plays the organ on this record and shows a nice touch at the keyboard on ""Shades of Brown"". The album was released during the late '60s when turmoil and protests were the order of the day on college campuses and black pride, with the help of Brown's hit song, was a rallying cry across the country."
2,BUYER BEWARE; This is NOT a Legit Copy of This CD!!,"I am a HUGE Lee Morgan fan, so my displeasure with this product has NOTHING to do with the musicianship.With that said, THIS is NOT the CD I THOUGHT I was purchasing. The song ""The Beehive"" (which was introduced to me by a friend and is on the legit recording) isn't even on this CD. Sound quality HORRIBLE! SUBSTANDARD! Sounds like it was dubbed from a recording produced by someone who ""smuggled"" a tape recorder into the club! Not the same album I heard from my friend who turned me on to it. And the song that made me purchase this CD in the first place ISN'T EVEN ON IT!!I FEEL TAKEN. BUYER BEWARE! DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS BROKER!!"
5,Best laundry sink,"This sink gives the best area and application for a laundry room sink. Big in size, hangs on wall so you still have floor space with no legs to clean around, fiberglass so easy to clean. Comes with all parts to install just needs a faucet and hookup to plumbing."
5,pat v,I had installed this sink in my washroom 10 years ago when I built my house. It is the best sink avilable in my opinion for what is used for. The hardware is first class and heavy duty. I built a workshop and couldn't find this sink anywhere. I could only find the cheap sinks (laundry tubs)that I wanted and they had flimsy legs on them. I wanted a wall mount sink so the underside could be kept clean and no clutter buildup could happen under the sink. I tried Amazon.com just for the sake of it and found the sink I wanted all along. This is a very good quality sink and would recomend it to anyone. I only wish the top where the valves mount was flat for you're new wide base faucets.
2,Invisible Stanley,I didn't like Invisible Stanley because it didn't have enough action or character's thoughts and feelings. Flat Stanley is much better than Invisible Stanley.I like how Stanley gets flat by a bulletin board.
3,"STYLISH, BUT DIFFICULT TO SET TIME/ALARM","I like Timex watches because, based on my own experience with them, they are durable and easy to set. I purchased the Timex Women's T5G291 Watch for my teenage daughter to wear while hiking/camping. While my daughter likes the watch, but she and I had a difficult time trying to figure out how to set the time and alarm, and the instructions weren't very helpful."
4,very good album,"this is a great album. its hard to compare this with heavenz movie because they are so different.all of the songs are great except for a few.the great ones are: schizophrenic, dont be dumb, whole wide world, never grow, murderah, before i go""""(1-6)and still thuggish ruggish, and one of the most personal songs ive ever heard by a rapper ,dont doubt me, he explains how he and bone thugs had problems but they can resolve them""( by the wway they are no longer with ruthless and bizzy has resolved differences with them which all stemmed fromthe contract with ruthless) and father. this cd has a much more rbish feel to it. i reccomend this album to fans of bizzy bone( dont be shocked if others find it strange)."
5,another BONE album = another great rap album,"if you like bone you wont be disapointed. though its not their best work, it's still a good album. bizzy uses his oh so famous voice and fast lyrics like he does to all other albums he been a part of and well i like this album.if I sound dumb right now it's cause I'm high big time cause I just heard the Extacy song from Bone and it got me in the mood ironic huh. and I must give Bone 5 stars cause there just couldn't be any other way hehe"
2,The price has gone up 20% in the last 2 months!,"We've been using Royal Canin Giant Breed dog food for about 8 years. We have had great results, however locating it has gotten to be a hassle until Amazon started carrying it for $52.49, which qualifies for free shipping. That was a good deal for me since my local Petco stopped carrying it. But in the last 2 months, the price has gone up 20% to $65.24. At this rate, we are now looking for an alternative. Amazon is pricing themselves out of the market."
5,Great for German Shepherds' Health & Sensitive Stomachs!,"We began feeding Royal Canin Giant Breed Adult to our first two German Shepherds in 1990. From 2-5 mos., we tried every top brand on them - Iams, Hills Science Diet (store brand and Vet line), Canidae, Eukanuba, etc. Some they wouldn't even touch and the ones they tried would come out one end or the other in no time at all. The pups were weak and sickly. Exhausted from their daily surprises, I found this food - their coats started shining, lots more energy, clear bright eyes, and NO stomach or health issues since."
2,Disapointed,"It's hard to tell if my dog likes the flavor of this food or not because she refuses to eat it. The food is like a charcoal briquet and even though my dog is large, 136 pounds, it will not break up the ""nuggets"" and eat the food. I fear I have little choice but to throw the entire bag out. Live and learn."
3,Amber all sorts and accessories,This book is mostly a thorough review of the state of knowledge of amber resins. For this purpose it is excellent but you might find it light on if for you are seeking in depth information about other botanical resins. The section on aloeswood is particularly scarce which disappointed me.
4,Excellent intro to databases and MySQL,"I am learning how to use PHP with databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. This book is packed with information about relational database in general and MySQL in particular. I can see it being a great reference for many years to come. Explains how to design database, setting up keys, good database practices, different SQL statements. Also, Larry Ullman has a good writing style. He explains things nicely without wrapping it in a lot of fluff. His books on PHP is great too. I highly recommend this book and wish that Larry would update it sometime, by now I expect that MySQL has advanced a little."
3,Some codes do not work,This book is wierd some of the codes do not work and some do.It is very fraustrating to me as a beginner to run into bugs in the book.
4,"Agagagagag, what a great collection","I agree with most all of you - this is a fantastic collection. Great choice of films, representative of the Fleischers' best work. Too bad the Disney types beat them out - who knows how much more imaginative American cartoons could have been had they followed the Fleischers' lead. But that just makes us appreciate the Fleischers more.BONUS: Out of the Inkwell silent toons, Krazy Kat, Koko, and many others you would never have seen.But of course, even in a great collection like this, there always seems to be a problem. In this case it's the commentaries. Some are fine, but there are way too many by John ""Ren and Stimpy"" Kricfalusi, another director I never heard of, and an ""animation student"" who does nothing but giggle stupidly in the background. This can't be the idea of whomever put together the rest of this wonderful collection. But please get it anyway."
5,DVD Done Right!!!,"This set is an example to other studios of how to release a well loved classic series. The transfers are pristine and the special features are worth watching. The commentaries that I've listened to so far enhance my watching of these episodes (exceptions are any by Kricfalusi, Fitzgerald and Fontecchio). After the previous Warner Bros release of Looney Tunes I was happy to see that a brief written disclaimer about ethnic, racist and sexist stereotypes of the time had replaced the tedious window dressing of Whoopee Goldberg on the Looney Tunes release.The episodes are all here, all uncut and all yours for the purchase of this DVD."
4,Very useful package.,I use this combo in flood & fire renovation. works well for a great variety of challanges. Without instructions my female helper switched batteries with no problem. The saw works almost as good as a corded Mil. I serously doublt that I will do serious bevel cutting with this type of saw. If I need accuracy I would use a Delta crossbuck saw. I would give it a five star if there was another battery and it is still doing the job after 5 years.
2,Battery life falls short of expectations,"Being a home remodler I own both Millwaukee and Dewalt cordless drills and saws. I have experianced the problem of removing the battery packs from my Millwaukee tools that other people have refered to, but I was able to overcome the problem with some silicone spray. My biggest problem is that I spent the money for the Milwaukee 18 volt combo pack thinking I was buying a ""HEAVY DUTY"" product, only to find out that the battery life of my 14.4 volt Dewalt set runs circles around BIG RED."
2,"Overly ""fishy"" odor and taste","I buy a lot of canned salmon, smoked and not. This time, I wanted a wild-caught version to avoid carcinogenic chemicals. As soon as I opened the can, a powerful fishy smell took over the kitchen, more powerful than sardines. The taste is overly fishy also. Maybe it was a bad can. If the rest are better, I'll write another review."
3,Crystal Curious,"The Illustrated Guide To Crystals was informative about gems and crystals and their uses. I found it to be a tad shallow and had hope for more details. It is an excellent ""Beginner Book"" for those wanting a quick look at crystals and their proprieties."
3,Nice kit but could be better for the price,"It's a nice kit and I am using and will continue to use it. I thought that the cup is too small, but this size is actually very convenient. But I don't like the black nonstick cover, especially on the pan where after a few uses bottom isn't smooth anymore. I'd prefer clean aluminium as I bought to my son in Walmart for less money. I also must notice that this mes kit wouldn't fit into a bigger pot from the same company, so you cannot expect that as well.But it's lightweight, strong enough, and pretty comfortable and I like it anyways."
5,Moon Over Madison - Best Hasil Adkins Record There is,"Moon Over Madison is one of the greatest albums that you can get. Start to finish is the best way to experience this masterpiece but if you don't have enough time in your day then put on ""I Had A Dream About You Last Night"". I start most of my days with this song and it really gets me going. In it he explains ""I had a dream last night, I had a dream last night, I had a dream I had a dream about you last night"". Now, depending on how you look at it, and I'm not implying that this is how it was written but the way I listen to this song he is telling a tale of a dream in which he had another dream in which he further had another dream about the person to whom he is singing. And doing such a great job at that."
2,"More New ""Old"" Books","As a loyal Veryan reader, I think this series lacks depth-inits plots, in its people, even in its locations. Her early books had fleshed-out characters (both human and animal) for whom I cared, and interesting plots that engaged me. Come back, Patricia Veryan! All is forgiven."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed reading this book. Didn't really recognize the Kellerman touch.
3,Not living up to expectations!,"Though Alex Delaware novels are always a good read, this book has an unbelievable plot, which does not jell well with reality. However, the pace of the book remains fast and adroit and first time readers must try other Alex Delaware books cause they have much better plot than this book.Or is it because the book is pro-Jewish and leans favorably on minorities - that some readers disturbing?"
4,Reliable and durable set,"We have been using this set for at least five years for cooking when backpacking and also for making coffee, etc. when just tent camping. Can't imagine what else you would want for backpacking, it is a good quality set. Cleans easily."
5,"slow going, but this book is a revelation","This book is unique in its depth, scope, and humility. I have been interested in these themes for a while, and I think people of any faith will appreciate the painstaking care that has been taken to integrate knowledge/evidence from experiment, logic, and experience.Definitely worth it, and it's surprising it isn't more popular. I think it's probably going to take a while for these ideas to seep into the broader public discourse."
1,Worthless band,"Do not buy any Timex Watch with this type of band, the last one I had lasted only a year. This is a common problem with this type of band. I only buy Timex Sports Watches with the Velcro type band. Buyer Beware!!!!"
2,"good feature set, but be careful, it might leak (easily)","It's a fine watch, but don't rely too much on the ""water resistant"" label. I've had similar Timex watches that had no trouble with leakage from being worn while swimming or kayaking. But as chance would have it, I got one that leaked (badly) from being worn in the water. (No button pushes under water or any other action that would have increased chance of leakage; it just leaked.)Too late to return to Amazon, and Timex warranty coverage for this sort of thing isn't clear. (Besides, shipping both ways would probably come up to half the cost of replacing with a new watch.)Too bad, it's otherwise a watch with a great feature set, maintains accuracy reasonably well, etc."
5,great watch,Gift for my son. He loves the features like three different alarms with different sounds and I love the durability.
3,Interesting facts and beginning source for info...,This book is especially slanted towards the Victorian era but does contain some Regency info that is helpful when wanting general information without indepth research. I would recommend backing up any facts with another source though. Some facts weren't dated so it was difficult to ascertain if they pertained to the Regency or Victorian era. All in all an enjoyable dive into history and helpful as simple research for history buffs or writers of light fiction.
3,Gets the job done.,"This book was purchased as the required textbook for a college anthropology course my wife and I took together. The book is a dated textbook and it reads like a dated textbook; often very dry and uninteresting though on the rare occasion the authors manage to present something in a more engaging manner. However, the book does provide a great deal of information and with frequent and short study sessions readers may be able to labor through the textbook, gleaning the information they need and avoid falling asleep."
4,"bad religion is great, but not the director of this video","Yes, you get to see Bad religion perform, and that alone is awesome, but I don't think the video as a whole is that great. The interviews could 've been better, that's for sure."
2,Should have been great...,"The gig in itself is great. Bad Religion in their prime; half ""Suffer"" songs, half older songs that are played much better than on the old records. The footage can be disturbing at times, since it's from several gigs (even if the audio is from one gig only), but that's not a big problem.The problem is this: I have both the VHS and the DVD, and while the VHS is in great sounding stereo - the audio on this DVD is in not-so-glorious mono. Someone apparently f*%&ed; up at some point.In other words: if you find the VHS somewhere, get it for the stereo recording."
5,It's survived 2 Newfies for over 3 months now!,"My 2 Newfoundland dogs (120-130 lbs) love this duck, they play ""tug"" with it all the time. It does indeed ""quack"" or honk! They have yet to rip off the wings, the feet or the tags. It got a small hole in the seam on the back but I sewed it up with dental floss (strong thread!) and it's been fine. Great toy, worth the money."
2,Took my dog about 20 minutes to rip it apart,"She really liked it but at least the one I got wasn't durable at all. Like all dogs she ""kills"" toys but almost never as quickly as this."
3,All good but the quack,"The toy seems to be holding up pretty solidly with my 2 75 and 90 lb labs. Normally, this kind of toy is destroyed in an hour. It has lasted 5 days and shows no wear so far, although I am not allowing any tug-o-war. I do have 1 big complaint tho. The quacker was not very loud when I open the package, and 2 days later, it wasn't making a sound. I am really disappointed about this as my dogs try so hard to make it quack with their noses but have no luck. I'm afraid this toy is going to go from 'favorite' to 'non-existant' in a matter of days."
1,5 minutes and stuffing everywhere,I have a black lab and don't consider her a strong chewer. She's typical. This is so poorly made that it was shredded in 5 minutes. I would not pay more than $1 for something that doesn't last. I don't recommend anyone wasting their money on it.
2,Newer ones are lower quality,"Three pheasants ago, our golden's first pheasant lasted thee years. He broke the squeaker quickly but the rest of it held up through tug-o-pheasant AND his chewing years. The last three pheasants have lasted less than 6 months each. The current one is losing limbs and the squeaker still works - it's only 4 months old. AKC, what gives on the low quality now?? Double the price and use a REAL stitch on the seams, it's stupid to throw away so many bird parts!"
3,"Nice Looking Toy, but My Dog Tore Off Both Wings in 12 Hours","Very detailed, good looking toy that has a great ""honk"" sound that is actually pretty realistic. The body appears to be fairly durable, but my 40 pound spaniel was able to tear off one wing within an hour and and the other wing within 12 hours of it arriving. Nonetheless, he absolutely loved this toy right out of the box and hasn't put it down since. If durability weren't such an issue, I would have definitely given it five stars. If you have a dog who isn't as determined to obsessively chew through and tear apart anything plush that you give to him, this would be a great toy."
1,try again,"This Saw is the worst tool from Milwaukee that I have ever purchased! It has weak gears in it , as far as I could tell, and have stripped out on me three times so far. They fix it but it strips again eventualy. I will buy another corded sawzall by Millwaukee , those cannot be beat. As for cordless , I just don't know."
1,Garden or Compost pile!,"Harsh words, yes! ""Into the Garden......."" was disappointing and quite a bit ""out there"". Way too new age. If you want a free copy just send me a SASE."
4,BFF,"The Bubblegum Babes bring to mind The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, only for a younger audience. Long time friends - Kelly, Sara, Meg and Emily - call themselves the Bubblegum Babes. Their different personalities and interests pull the Babes in different directions during their first year in middle school. Their commitment to the group is tested when their lives extend to include new friends, sports, and activities that not all of them share. Will boy friends, cheerleading, and just growing up threaten their friendship?This first book of their series is told in vignettes from Kelly's point of view. Adolescent hormones, hurt feelings, and individuality often provoke disagreements and resentment, but Kelly looks at friendship like a marriage. You may not like all the behaviors of your friends, but you love them anyway. Young girls facing the problems and responsibilities of middle school will enjoy reading about the difficulties the Bubblegum Babes face."
1,Awful Printer,"This printer is a total piece of crap. You will burn through cartridges, deal with constant jams and spend a great deal of time trying to repair it. The Customer Service is awful as well. It also demands to take paper from the Manual Paper tray even when that is not selected anywhere. Then, it will decide to constantly jam when it does take from the manual try. Awful, awful, awful."
1,worst laser printer Ive ever used,"Whenever I want to print something, it just takes so long and troubles so much. slow start(self detect every time it powers up),loud noise"
3,Great fun,Unfortunately this game Third edition will only work on older computers. However I will go into my sons room and use his playtime computer to play this game. It challenges the mind and this would be good in a cross-word puzzle like game.Big RedWho Wants to Be a Millionaire 3rd Edition Interactive Dvd Game (Reg 2)
1,Deeply saddened,"I loaded up the 3rd Edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire expecting hours and hours of quality entertainment. I was sorely disappointed. After only a couple of hours of playing the 600 new questions were exhausted. With the 2nd Edition, which I have played for at least 10 times as much wihtout seeing repeat questions. This was $19.99 NOT well spent. Downloading the 'additional' questions only allowed for a few more rounds before my fun was over.Take my advice and stick with games such as 'You Don't Know Jack' or even the on-line version of Trivial Pursuit and you will be much, much happier.O'Doyle Rules!"
3,Something missing...,"I just bought this game (6/15/01) and perhaps I'm being too quick to judge, but there's something missing from this edition. To me it doesn't seem fluid enough. Mind you, my computer meets the specs for this title (PIII 1 gig./ 128 MB ram), however, the programing deosn't seem ""tight"" like the 2nd edition. Perhaps it has something to do with the exclusion of Jellyvision (of You Don't Know Jack! fame) as the lead programmers. Maybe there's something wrong with my computer, but there's too many split-second pauses and skips that make this edition feel like a 2nd generation Xerox of the 2nd edition.I did, however, like the inclusion of the graph for the Ask the Audience ""lifeline"". And since I haven't exhausted the questions yet, I do look forward to the downloadable question packs.For you trivia purists out there, do buy this title for a good fix until Jellyvision comes out with the next YDKJ...."
2,"disappointing, to say, the least","Well, to you truth. I listen to mostly hard rock/alternative/metal bands. However, when i picked up the cd, $7.99 i thought i give it a try. Sorry, to say only the song ""So Cold"" 1st song was the best. Even that is a tool rip-off to an extent. other decent songs were firefly and simple design. Well, lets just say the other songs i heard better done with bands who done it many times that it sounds generic. If you want good hard rock(today), get audioslave(least they are decent) or their former bands, NIN, SOAD, Tool(more metal),Chevelle, If you want classic metal/rock, get Black sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Moterhead, early metallica, megadeth heavier stuff: slayer, pantera, crtyposy, sepultra well you get the point and discover a big world of music. i would buy it used or if you just have alot of money to spend. Or if you like the genre."
3,Buyer beware--this is the clean version,"I love BB. They're a great band and I've seen them live several times. However, I guess I should have read the reviews of this more closely--I downloaded this as a replacement for my ORIGINAL ""We Are Not Alone"" CD and got a nasty surprised when I realized the CD had been re-written for some unknown reason to remove all the ""swear words"".I would appreciate it if Amazon made this clear somewhere up above. It's great the band went through the effort of redoing the songs to make the ""clean"" versions sound just as good as the originals and it's not like their songs had that much swearing in them to begin with. But when I pay for a CD like this from a band I know swears I want the songs in their original condition.3 stars because I rate this ""clean"" album as just okay. 5 stars for the original."
2,Nu Metal bologna,"So Cold is the only good songPlus, listen to Spiders by System of a Down. Hear any similarities? Breaking Benjamin just might have stolen the rift from someone else."
3,The new rock band.,"I am so sick of seeing all these 4 and 5 stars. I purchased this CD when I heard ""So Cold"" and it really isn't that great. There are a few songs on this CD that are worth listening (""Sooner or Later"" and ""Away"") but for the most part it sounds the same to me.Kudos to the lead singer though, his voice is amazing. Too bad he doesn't do more acoustic and better rock songs.I'm not saying the cd is horrible, I'm saying it's okay. It's worth checking out."
5,sick,this cd is great. just an overall solid cd. havent listened in depth to all the tracks individually but i've casually listened to most of them and they are great.good stuff. strongly recommended :)
2,"11 songs, all the same","All the songs are the same, with the exception of so cold and simple design, which are are basically the same song. It's not lyrically they're the same, but they're all set up the same. Guittar rift, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, rift, chorus, every song is set up this way, and it becomes quite apparent after a few listens. I just listen to the first 3 songs, then give up and listen to something else. Here's the main problem i have. 1) I love the first 3 songs a ton, a ton, and every song is very catchy. 2) But it's so repetitive. These two things tell me that breaking benjamin has a lot of talent, but just got lazy and wanted the easy way out, which was make every song mainstream like. They didn't even make an effort to mix the songs up a bit, maybe put their 2 best songs - 1so cold and 2simple design in random places on the cd, just some effort. It really disapoints me that they have so much potential and did nothing with it."
4,they are standing alone,i was suprised to hear that the old sm singer made this cd well pat of it. i love how bb can take hard rock and lighten it up alittle.
2,Typical follow the pack group...,"Don't get me wrong, I respect Breaking Benjamin's work as musicians, but it would be much more effective if it had come before the countless streams of mainstream rock bands with Maynard sound-alike vocals. I am not criticizing the vocalist's natural singing voice, but criticizing his knack for emulating Tool vocalist Maynard's style to every last sigh and slur. The album has some standout songs such as single So Cold, #3: Follow, and #7: Sooner or Later. However, even these songs fall into the void of forgotten music after a few listens.Bottom Line: Breaking Benjamin's We Are Not Alone sticks with the listener at the beginning but in the end falls short. Tool stepped ""out of the box"" to make their music and ended up creating a new ""box"" that artists such as ""Breaking Benjamin"" need to get out of."
1,i don't think so,There are perhaps 30 good pages of writing in this book. 30. Out of 260. Anne Carson is one of the most over-rated writers to have snuck into the American scene in decades.
5,This is a must-have book,Living Aboard Your RVNot everyone can retire young but Jamie makes the RV travel dream possible for anyone including those who must work along the way
5,My Favorite Souvenier,The artwork captures the artists love for the area and gives a visitor this insight. I find myself transported every time I look at my book.
5,BADD RADD,One of the best albums of all time ! I was a sophomore at Fisk Univ in Nashville when this album came out (1976) and everyone on campus had the album -the instrumentals cuts on the album sound better today than they did back then-Hats off to the Bros Johnson and Quincy---------
4,the start of it all.....,"this was the start of an incredible Brothers Johnson run. An excellent showcase of funk from the dynamic duo. Their original debut song appears on the Quincy Jones out of print but superb ""Mellow Madness"". Following with this album the same year. The weakest cuts would probably be ""The Devil"", and ""Come Together"". Other than than that it is a sure shot effort. They continued their magnificnt streak with Quincy for the next 5 years."
5,"Wonderful look about life, sports, and hospitality","This book provided wonderful insight into family life and its struggles, an intimate sports setting, and the hospitality of the Benedictine community at St. John's."
5,As light as Ti for a fraction of the cost,"I bought this cook set for use with a specific alcohol stove set, I researched the various Titanium pot sets and found that this was for all intents-and purposes just as light but for a fraction of the cost. The money I saved on getting these I will put toward purchasing the stove."
1,Blew up After 32 Days,"Same junk as other cheaper manufacturers carry. Don't think just because its ""Antec"" its the best, its WAY far from it."
3,nice fan,"The fan is great. Quiet, etc. Unfortunately, it didn't come with screws, and, with this fan being much deeper than the one it replaced, those screws weren't long enough. I couldn't find screws for it anywhere and so I drilled out bigger holes and got some wood screws from Home Depot and made it work."
4,Not your usual boring run of the mill greatest hits albums.,"A Wonderful retrospective from one of the most talented and clever bands. Great selections from those classic albums of theirs but there is one question. Why are the tracks from their biggest seller Breakfast in America much shorter whereas the others aren't? ""Goodbye Stranger"", ""The Logical Song"" and ""Take the Long Way Home"" aren't the same unless they are heard in their entirety. If you buy this album, I highly suggest you go out and pick up the Breakfast In America album where you can experience the uncut versions of those wonderful songs."
3,Great 70's Music in condensation (3 STARS),"I don't know if Supertramp ever decided what it wanted to be- a bublegum pop band or a guitar-based rock band. But, in the middle of that perported insanity, came one of the most defined sounds of the seventies and eighties.And ""Classics"" has all the songs the title suggests. ""Goodbye Sranger,"" ""Take the Long Way Home,"" and ""Give a Little Bit."" Plus it has some songs that the so-called ""casual fan"" may not have heard, but will enjoy. The reflective ""logical song,"" the trippy English pride of ""Bloody Well Right,"" the impioty of ""Dreamer,"" and the bold irony of ""Breakfast in America.""So, no, concept albums (or even detailed albums) was not something Supertramp used its energy on. But if good, clean-cut singles is what the band wanted to do, you'll hear no complaints from most music fans. Anything that allows us to ""put our heads in our hands and be dreamers."""
1,It burned out in 6 months,"I bought it in the middle of December 2006. Today June 18, 2007, I turned it on to use it and it burned out and smoke was coming from the vents. The plastic around the slot the tube goes into broke twice..had no choice but to stitch it with thread to keep it attached to the plastic cap. So disappointed with this product. Don't buy it. Better to spend the money and buy professional. This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it."
3,Loud but effective,I found this hair dryer to be loud. You will not be able to hear the tv while you're using it. It does dry well under the medium setting but gets too hot under the higher setting. I do like the fact that it's portable.
1,Unusable hair dryer,"This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet. It's basically useless."
4,Bonnet connection is poor,"I have owned this dryer for two years and have enjoyed it very much. I use it weekly. However, I wish to buy a new bonnet and cannot seem to find a way to do this. I have used glue and rubber bands for a few weeks now and am tired of fussing with it. The dryer works fine but I NEED a new bonnet. Can you help????"
2,bonnet rips easily,"After 3 uses, the bonnet ripped away from the where the air hose attaches. I sent an e-mail and called company's 800 number and got NO response. It also leaks hot air where the hose attaches to unit. I would not recommend this product."
2,Only one per order!,"This is a nice footbag. However, the picture shows 4 bags, but there is only one per order!"
3,Almost the same as the Manual,"The book was complete complete and I did not see any mistakes but it was mainly just a nicer printed version of the manual. There were some scripts and explanaitions but not much. If you want a bound and printed reference it is good, otherwise I would just use the only manual and example code from the shopping cart or a miva programming site."
1,Horrible for the beginner!,"Look, I have a BS in Computer Science. I see so many manuals that it would make your head swim. This book ranks up with the worst of the worst. It is a reference, NOT a guide. If you already know Miva, great, buy the book. If you are just beginning, keep searching because this book does nothing, absolutely ZIP in helping you create, maintain an ecommerce website."
2,Not impressed,Rather small and outdated for the price. The majority of the information in the book is nothing that you wouldn't find yourself just by searching on the Internet- for free. Sort of a disappointment really. I was so looking forward to receiving this book and then changing our dogs' diets but the diet plan in here is extremely vague. Look elsewhere for info if your dog has Cushings or SARDS.
4,Needs Indicator light,"We are very happy with the alarm for the most part. However, as I read in one of the reviews, I agree that there should be a light (or some indication) showing that the alarm is armed. We set it at night on ""Home"", and I'm always afraid that my husband will forget and open the door in the morning without disarming it. We live in apartment and I'm sure the neighbors wouldn't appreciate false alarms early in the morning."
3,ge home securty system,the ge home securty system is a basic model. but it both made me feel more secure as it will alert me to an intruder or hopefully scare one away. i did want more and today just purchased a cellular wireless system that will call for help while im away from home. again through amazon. all of my purchases and gifts ive gotten have been good deals and the shipping is excellent. love amazon. my daughter showed it to me and im a return customer. with the state of our economy crime is increasing as a result. protect yourself and your home.
2,Not a central system,The large box pictured must be placed on the door. The 3 other sensors operate independently with no central program box.
3,Window alarms not very useful.,"The window alarms turn off when the window is closed again. Also they are not very loud, and not integrated with the door alarm.The alarm delay is too long. It would be easy to take the batteries out of the alarm in that time.However, this alarm system is a good deal for that price."
4,"Easy install, pretty loud","I got this system for my house, and I agree that this is a relly good product, I use the Chime a lot so that I'll know when the door opens when I'm upstairs but won't set off an alarm.. the alarm function is also pretty loud. I used the window system on the door as well and it works perfect. I would recoment this item to those who want an indication when a door or window is open and it does not come with monthly membership."
3,It'll work but dont expect too much,"This product is a good deal if you want something. The system is not too fancy. If you hope that the noise will ward off intruders and notify neighbors, it will do that. Wondering whether the adhesive will damage the paint on the door sills. You might not like the design, they may take away from the appearance of your place."
5,Alarm System,"this item is great for apartment living and i highly recomend this product, front door alarm is ear pearcing and if you have it at ear level you will hear ringing for a couple of days, window alarms arent bad either there perfect for a one story apartment as i would hear them out of a dead sleep.wich is why i bought this product, my toddler can now open doors and the door chime feature is perfect and u can set all of the alarms to chime if thats what u need then easily flip a button to alarm great product"
1,Not working properly,"I've set up one window alarm and the front door alarm, but when I test by opening and closing the window and door, these alarms are not going off properly, most times they don't go off period, and it's quite frustrating. When I take them off the door and window, they chime or beep in my hand, but not at the place where they are suppose to chime and beep, the front door and the window! I've tried everything too, so that's not it. This thing is just not reliable, and I feel as though I've wasted my money. I was really hoping that this would work, and really like the keypad with code. Shame."
3,GE51107 smart home wireless alarm the system kit,the door bell or charm work perfect but alarm does not so its ok for a door bell but wrothless for alarm system.
3,The Door alarm and Window alarm works separately,Those who are buying this thinking that the door alarm and the window alarms works together in a full alarm system package like I did is wrong.The door alarm works just as the door alarm or chime and the 3 window alarm works separately from the whole system. This is not a kit. It's just 4 separate alarms/chimes.I do not suggest this kit if you are looking for an alarm kit. This makes a great kit for 4 chimes.
3,It'll do for now,"Can't expect a heck of lot from a $35.00 alarm system. Thank God I'm poor enough to suffice with this gadget, but as soon as I hit the lottery, I'm going to upgrade to this hard-wire stuff I've been hearing about. Who wants their home security hinged on some batteries? But for what it is, and if you can use an added security noise besides barking dogs, then this is OK."
4,is a good product,"It is a good product for me, does the job I need, even more'll ask 2 kit.What I do not like is that the sensors if the windows are closed stop ringing."
1,Defected unit,"Door Alarm is defected, blinking red light all the time and alarm goes on any settings so have to remove batteries.One of window unit is not working. I tried to return it but 2 of window unit was already mounted on the window frameand it is very hard to remove it . Is there any way I can return Door alarm and one of the window alarm and have replacement?Please let me know what to do. Thank you."
3,Good for small apartments.....,My husband deployed and I was going to be all alone in my apartment for a whole year and so I got these for extra safety measures...I live in a one bedroom apartment so these are ideal for small homes...the window alarms aren't too loud but the door alarm is...and they're toy-like..it made me feel safer though because I'd be alerted if someone was breaking into my home.
5,Answers lots of problems,I bought MemPlug as a Christmas gift for my wife. She's a Doctoral Student and uses her Prism for everything. She plugged it in and had it working without issue. It has so many possiblities it boogles the mind. The Laptop will stay put more and more.
1,Physician,"Being a physician, I need lots of memory to store my medical programs and I was excited about this product. But I found that the PI Direct program did not always work, my system continued to crash and it was not reliable. This is not good when a patient is dying and I need information quick. So I returned it and I am still waiting for my refund. If it did work, I would be very happy."
1,Bad With Visor Deluxe,"The MemPlug may work just fine, with other visor models, but it needs Palm OS 3.5 if you want to run app's or access files directly from the module. The Visor Deluxe comes with Palm OS 3.1. You can still store stuff on the card, but you have to move apps or files back to RAM any time you want to use them. It makes retrieving data a slow and cumbersom process."
1,I want my money back and this was free...,"Perhaps this project was some sort of poor man's therapy but the end result is uneven and overly syrupy. Perhaps Mr. Bass should use his talents where they are better developed. Believe me, there are better and cheaper drink coasters available everywhere."
4,A search for happiness in the wrong places...,"Your Friends & Neighbors is tale about six people and their immoral connection to one another, which is based on sex. The film itself offers some interesting dialogues as it dissects the characters and their lustful needs for each other. As these needs are examined it is evident that what has surfaced is not always what is sought after, and in the absence of what is desired it is understandable that happiness is not obtained. Your Friends & Neighbors is a small film with a small cast that analyzes the question of what people think they want and what people really want. In the end, it is a pretty good cinematic experience."
1,Awful,"This is another naively written screenplay by some twenty-something male who knows nothing about life, love, or women. The dialogue is inane, and the acting is horrible. Skip this one, but if you must see it, borrow it!"
4,Two Brilliant Films,"The films, based on Neil Labute's Plays, are both wonderful in their own ways, however, both fall flat on that final, final scene. Scenes that always keep you questioning, what next? However I don't give either of the films lower than a four rating because they are good, they do examine the human condition, they do examine males in society, females in society, chauvinism, and in that, they make for great and wonderful films."
5,Love it!,"I bought this diaper bag for the size and appearance. I'm not one to tote around a diaper bag with cartoon characters or a lot of flashy color. I searched for something simple, yet big enough to hold everything you need for baby. I LOVE THIS BAG! It has lots of pockets on the inside. I carry two changes of clothes, about 10 diapers, wipes, 4 or 5 toys, my digital camera, a juice cup, baby lotion, baby food, a container with an extra binky in it, and the changing pad that it comes with. There is plenty of room for all this plus some extra. It wipes clean, and the material is a very durable material. A GREAT bag definitely worth it!!!"
4,Timex Ironman - as expected,This is my 4th Ironman. This one performs as expected with all features as previous models. The only drawback is the IndiGlo is not even bright enough to read. Poor visibility when in low light or dark. Only use this particular model without the back light.
5,Psychic scammers exposed,"Read this confession before engaging any so-called psychic! The author's testimony is a rare-find in a world of tricksters, scammers and criminals who take advantage of others at every opportunity. This book reveals that the dark underworld of ""psychics"" and exposes certain personalities for who they really are. Psychics are never what they claim to be. Don't be conned by the next con who advertises herself as a pretty face ""psychic"". The only thing they're reading is the amount of cash in your wallet!The publisher should be thanked for reprinting this out-of-print book."
1,Got oldest version ever,You'd think I'd learn to stop ordering this book. Four times now I have received the oldest editio possible when I ordered and paid for the current edition!
2,I would have been better off just purchasing the online PRAXIS review,"There just isn't much to this review. One can find the same information, free of charge, on the PRAXIS website, or at least pay a minimum fee and review online."
4,Does what it says,"This is a great guide to show you what of the test content you do and don't know. Some reviewrs seemed upset it didn't provide straighforward answers for the test; it's not supposed to do that. The study guide is best used as just that: a guide to indicate what you need to study up on. if you buy it far enough ahead of time to be able to look at what you don't know, it's a great tool. The Praxis II tests are meant to assess potential teachers' knowledge of their subject area; frankly, if you need one book to give you the test answers, you may need to reconsider the field you're going into.Over all: not a magic test-killing bullet, but a valuable resource if used properly."
5,springing up life on the front porch,"With these springs you can watch the day go by once again! Sunrise, sunset, neighborhood kids going by on their bikes, dogs barking in your neighbors yard, mischievous situations brewing in the trees amongst the raccoons and squirrels, etc. These springs will actually work on your porch swing really well, and I'm surprised since my knowledge with the subject is limited greatly to just, well, a spring is a spring, lol. Not really sure if there's other types of springs that work more effectively or what. Either way the porch swing works so I don't have to dirty my bottom using the porch steps and watch my back for ants that may be crawling up my shirt. That makes me very nervous."
3,porch swing springs,"These springs are heavy enough, but they squeak and don't operate smoothly.I would recommend getting the Orrco brand expansion style spring."
4,Cecilio 15in viola,"It has been a several weeks since I received my Cecilio 15in Viola. I have been enjoying the sound and the learning experiance. For the vender and the deal I got when purchacing the item I give high marks; however, the bow that came with the outfit below par compared to the actual instrument. the silver/nickle wrapping is nothing more than clear nylon line over what looks like aluminium foil. Again I must point out this is no fault of the vender, Cecilio just needs to improve the quality of their bows with their string outfits.I would gladly purchase for this vender again. maybe soon =)"
3,Cecilio CVA-400 15-Inch Rosewood Fitted Solid Wood Viola,"Pros: CheapCons: When my son tried it first time, 2 strings pop and it cost my wife $100 for new string and labor. When it was fixed, the hairs in the bow came off one by one.Overall, I think if you install a nice string and buy a good bow, this viola will sound close to those expensive ones at half the price. By the way, my son is using Yamaha which is a thousand dollars worth and he said he will not play that Cecilio because his Yamaha is a lot better in may ways."
1,Great as a large paper weight. I Wish I could give it negative stars.,This piece of **** died after 2 weeks. Completely dead. TWO WEEKS. I will never buy anything from this company again. Best lesson learned to save my receipts!
3,More Funny than Scary,"Well I am a fan of horror movies, but for the most part this set is just so cheesy you have to laugh. A couple of the movies have a good plot, but remember these are probably B movies at best!"
2,Bat and ball set,I ordered two of these and one of the balls broke taking it out of the package. I bought this set for the bat and I also bought a Nerf Swerve bat and ball set and the Nerf bat is way better and cheaper. We added bat grip to the bat to improve comfort.
1,Stay Away From These Disc-Killers,"I bought several dozen of this brand of sleeves a few years ago, and I've just had to throw away fifty or sixty discs full of archived files because these products had made them unreadable. Apparently the plastic of the sleeve adheres to the plastic of the disc just enough to cause some sort of chemical reaction which fogs the disc surface, and makes it impossible for my optical drive's lasers to read the info that's stored underneath.I've just laboriously removed all my discs from these sleeves, checked to see if they would mount, and then re-sleeved the survivors in paper sleeves. What a waste!"
4,Contemporary ukiyo-e,"This is another interesting book about the woodblock print style art of Masami Teraoka. It was published in the late 1980's but the content is not outdated or stale. Try to get a like-new condition copy if purchasing used, as the front and back covers are white, and get dog-earred quite quickly.I liked the black-and-white photos of the artist Teraoka, and there are plenty of vivid color images of his artworks interspersed with narrative by Howard Link."
2,A model 90 Jimmy 1500 Owner's eview,A very shallow book trying to cover too many years and subjects with so little number of pages.
4,"A great series, to bad there is only one season","I didn't discover this series when it was on TV and that was my lost. But I've discovered it now! If you are a fan of detective stories like Numbers, you will like this series."
3,"Too stuck up, Not a good ending.","The book started out well, the author giving good details on the physical and emotional appearences of the characters. However, the ending was not well written. I think that Brooke and Pamela could have grown to love each other for who they really were, as Brooke and Peter did. The book was definately not as well written as Crystal and I have yet to read Butterfly and Raven, both of which I am looking forward to. Hopefully they will include more suspense than Brooke did. I felt that Pamelas character and attitude was a bit overdone. Brooke was a good character, spoiled by a not so good writer, and hopefully she has better luck in Runaways."
1,so far the orphans have been terrible,"I am a huge V. C. Andrews fan, I love each and every one of her series, except this new one. I like the idea of the miniseries like the green mile from stephen king, but these books are so immature, I feel like their Fear Street books, when I'm used to adult novels from v. c. Butterfly and Brooke were so alike it was silly, same overpowering mother trying to turn them into something they're not, now I'm sure Raven will be just like Crystal. Since the Runaways is supposed to be a full novel, I just hope it makes up for this boring series. But being the devoted V. C. follower I am, I must buy these books because it puts the illusion that V. C. is still published novels. I can't wait for Muted Voices, the Logan series was very good. ~Tom Nordlum"
5,Great!,"This was a great book! My only regret is that I wish this book could be longer, But It's just fine how it is none the less. I really love how the girls are coming together, it's really neat. Keep them coming! I Can't wait or Raven and Runaways!"
2,Hmm,"Like Butterfly and Crystal, Brooke is another girl hard on her luck. But this made-for-teens series is simply not VCA caliber - and no VCA fan should expect it to be so. However, most of us had to learn the hard way, by reading the book itself. It'd have been okay if this was written under a different name and not passed off as a VCA book.I was hoping that Brooke's new dad would be the one to have mental issues, because Butterfly and Crystal's new moms were the ones with mental issues. But Brooke's mom is completely obsessed with beauty and even adopts Brooke based on her looks and places certain demands on the poor girl. So she gets the distinct impression that her new mom just wants a dress-up doll to play with instead of a real daughter. :/"
2,Not That Pleased,"I was looking for a simple to use running watch for my wife. She doesn't run marathons, doesn't need split times and is suffering from the same thing everyone has as they get older - poor near vision. I was hoping for a watch with large digits that were easy to read and very few buttons to push to just get a strart and stop time. Timex has put the stop button on the right instead of on the top so now it's harder to stop the watch. and they have added so many other features that the watch is no longer that easy to use."
4,Red Hot Harlem,"This fine ensemble is generally overlooked by fans of the swing era but you won't be disappointed by this well-chosen sampler. As usual for this label, there is a generous selection of good music here, with excellent sound. Plenty of jumpin' tunes, put out there by some of the finest players of the day."
4,"1001 Ways to Make More Money as a Speaker, Consultant or TrainerT",This book is a must for those just starting out. Maximize your output a the beginning! Start at the top and just keep working your way up. Great tips!
2,WHAT HAPPENED??,"Me and my husband had one of these irons before and loved it. We were happy to order another one online. It was delivered as usual in a timely manner and packaged in its original box (brand new). Great job amazon. The iron however lasted about 2 months before it started burning clothes. The non-stick surface just stop working. Iron was so hot, we would put it on medium for silk and fabrics of that nature and it was still burning 100% cotton fabrics. We ended up tossing it in the trash."
3,Good Iron but Stopped Working,"While this iron worked it was a great iron but as with most of them, it eventually stopped working. Tfal did send a $5 coupon towards the purchase of another Tfal iron. I am giving three stars because it just stopped heating up with no warning. At this price, I would have expected longer use."
1,Defective,"The automatic shutoff doesn't stay shut off. I can hear the iron cycling on and off when no one has touched it in the last hour -- dangerous to say the least. It also appears that this was one someone else had returned, as there were water deposits built up in the steam holes and some glop on the sole plate. Very disappointing. Glad I don't have to pay to return it."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this based on the reviews and was very disappointed. After reading the directions twice and waiting for the iron to get hot it didn't get out the wrinkles from my clothes. Some tops I ironed twice and it didn't even look like I had ironed them at all. My previous iron was another T-Fal model that I had for 10 years and I loved it! I would not recommend this model.Instead I would recommend Black & Decker which I purcased from Target two days after receiving this T-Fal model. The Black & Decker has a retrackable cord, heats up quickly, irons clothes beautifully and costed less than $30 at my local Target in Philadelphia."
4,T Fal iron,"I like this iron very much. The instructions with it were pretty useless at a quick glance. One of the reasons I bought it was for the easycord; however, the use of that required much fiddling with the iron and no good instructions."
2,disappointment,"This iron was rated highly by Consumer Reports, however, I tried two of them and both of them leaked. Both irons left large water marks on the fabric, regardless of the heat setting. I will try another brand and would not recommend this iron as satisfactory."
3,Not the best,This was a replacement for an earlier version of the TFall iron. Its surface is wonderful but the water filling is much more difficult and it is always making noise with cracking/ popping sounds. I loved the earlier version. This is just not as good.
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"This iron is the worst we have ever owned. We bought it based on the positive reviews on Amazon. It leaked periodically from the start and then after 3 months, it will no longer heat. Stay away from this one!"
4,Nice Iron,"This is a very nice iron. The glide plate is smooth and makes lovely creases. The cord stays out of the way. The only negative is that it spits a little with the steam on 3, fortunately I have only used that setting for pillow cases and flat sheet top hems. I am a seamstress and will be doing lots of projects in the future. I expect a long life and a lot of ironing from this little blue goodie."
1,Great at first...Then suddenly is a nightmare.,Same story as many other users- My iron's about 9 months old and was great the first 9 months and over the last month it's begun leaking all over the place. I only use filtered water in it. I've tried cleaning it on the self- cleaning cycle multiple times and with water and vinegar and it doesn't help. It's unusable at this point. I'm going to try to call customer service will update.
4,excellent product,"is good shape, weight is not too light or heavy, heats quickly . . controllable thermostat . . could have an ever higher heat range for upholstery weight linen"
1,Doesn't get hot enough,"If you want to iron cotton or linen don't buy this iron. It does not get hot enough to take the wrinkles out. The heating element just turns itself off even though the knob is cranked to the hottest setting. The old spit on finger method of testing the hotness barely gets a sizzles. Also, the water from the steam resevoir dribbles out through the steam vents onto the fabric. A waste of money."
4,smooth ironing,"There were no directions in English so the first time I put water into it, it all ran out. Very frustrating. When I had more time I looked at the pictures on the box. Through native mechanical ability and intelligence I got the iron to work well."
1,Are You People Insane?????,"Sometimes I wonder if I am, and then I see reviews like this, only agreeing with two other people, and thank God it's not just me! Please, if you're a true Moodies fan, you realize the band's music is about sophistication and deification. Let these bluegrass musicians go cover Aerosmith and AC/DC songs, because neither of those bands has any etherialism or class either. Of course Justin Hayward said he loves this crap in an interview; he was being polite because he's not friggin' Elton John who would probably vomit if someone covered ""Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding"" this way as well!This isn't a tribute to a great band as much as a desecration and blasphemy. Everything magical about the Moodies' music is sucked right out of these representations, especially my beautiful and cherished ""Late Lament."" It's just like someone peeing on your gravestone and claiming they came to water your flowers."
4,Tijuana Christmas,"This is an old LP, so I expected some scratches, which it did have. It was as advertised."
4,"I love ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"".","I love ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" series of books they are really fantastic works of fantasy-literature. I do own both ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" books and they are one of my many top favourite bookseries ever to be penned. I am glad I got a different edition of the books that stay together, have good drawings of Middle-Earth, and have the sentences worded correctly.I looked at versions of these books seperately in the store and thought WOW! what a generic version trying to pass on us avid readers and ""LOTR"" fans. I would suggest buying the Houghin Mifflin versions of ""The Hobbit"" and all three volumes of ""The Lord Of The Rings"". To the reviewer's who cover came off of ""The Hobbit"" I am glad you were able to return this boxset and able to get better versions of the books."
5,A fantastic fantasy.,"The hobbit and the lord of the rings both (or should I say all four) take you on adventures away from your real life trouble, then shortly after dreaming of characters: big as Smaug the dragon,little as a child hobbit/elf/or dwarf, fat (and as out of shape) as Bomber, thin as a, tall as,young as a baby man, and as old as the legends of the old (not to mention the ruin letters). The only problem is that when I started thinking about it, it was actually upseting for characters to pass away, or even be hurt or sent an adventure. But the most disturbing of all was the fact that as the time went on in the books, there were some friends (or enemy's) that you would never hear about again or that treasures would be lost forever mostly friendship and trust. I do hope that you at least read part of the book."
2,Great!!!!!!,"This is a classic and one of the greatest works of all time. Tolkien must have been a genius to create a detailed and imaginative world from scratch. The low rating I must apologize for. I am rating this edition and not the book. The book deserves 10 stars. This edition is cheap, with constant misspellings and faded and worn print all over the book. Spend your good money on a nicer edition and you will be justly rewarded."
3,Interesting but much too long,"Having heard very much about this ""master piece"" I fought my way through the 1,500+ pages. If it wasn't for the ""Lord of the Rings"" I would have stopped reading after 100 pages. Hudge descriptions of surrounding trees, plants, mountains and so on made it hard to keep the eyes open. Looking at 41 ""5-Stars"" I know that my ranking won't make me very popular, but this book isn't worth it!"
5,Fantastic - Tolkien created an entire genre,"Through this work, Tolkien created an entire genre single handedly. This work is of increadible imigination and style. The story itself is superb and the charecters are wonderful. Tolkien creates an entire world and populates it with wonderful and frightening creatures. These are books to get lost in and you are sad when you reach the end. After reading other fantasy stories for years before reading this, I realize that every other author was just a pale imitation of Tolkien. You simply must read these stories."
1,I just don't get it.,"I read the hobbit when younger and thought it was ok (I have since attempted to re-read it and couldn't through it). I tried to read the Lord of the Rings and was bored stiff. I have since tried to read them, at least 5 times, because so many people find them great. I do not get why. I find them dull, dry, and rather cartoonish. I know there are probably going to be a lot of people offended by this review but that is perfectly alright by me....not everyone thinks Tolkein is the 'genius' of the fantasy genre."
5,lotr book set,"I'm not a fan of the cover art taken from the movies, I wished they'd chosen to go with something more traditional, but besides that no complaints. A wonderful series."
3,Why there isn't a total package size and weight,"The product dimensions that's in the product details is: 4.3 x 4.2 x 7 inchesBut when I get the package,I paid according to the package dimensions (18 x 14 x 26cm).You must to present the total package dimensionssame thing with the weight,in the product details is: 2 pounds=0.907185 KgBut the total weight(package+books) is 1.2Kg"
5,the best book ever,i do not read a lot just now and then but Tolkien's book i could read many times and everytime i would find something different. He is the best in the business. All that i want to say is that anyone who never read his books does not know what the good reading is all about.
5,A basic reading requirement,"LOTR should be a basic reading requirement for all starting at the high school ages but upon learning that Christopher Lee ( played the bad wizard, Saruman ) reads it yearly & was able to do this part and the Star Wars Count Dooku at age 80, well I am now thinking maybe annual reads would keep one viable in the elder years !"
5,The best book I ever read,"This is a great book called the Hobbit. I think it is the best because, it has almost everything a good book needs. It has a lot of action, excitement and some scary things. The best thing I liked about this book is the action some of it is scary but most of it is exciting because, there are fights between the hobbit and a guy from the nearby town. Some things that could of been better is the scariness and the action it wasn't that bad. This is a book for ages 10 - 14. That is my review about the Hobbit."
2,immature,"I read these books when I was 14 and I was thoroughly impressed I loved them reread them and all things Tolkien. But since then I'v grown up physically and mentally and after starting to read them again and realised how stupid it truely is. I'm greatful for these books because they motivated me to read bigger and better things but I shudder to think how so many are so big about this fantasy nonsence. The heroes like Gandalf and Aragorn are infallible saints while the enemies are black evil creatures with no morals whatsoever. It reads like some Christian propaganda story for adolescents. If your an adult don't bother with this farce, it passes itself off as an intellectual book but its really the product of an old arrogant man's daydreams. Book for kids thats it."
2,Boring!,"I'm sorry, but these books are boring. There is not enough action in order to keep my child interested in continuing to read these stories. I am very disappointed!"
1,the only book that ever made me cry...wanna know why????,"this is the only book i have ever read that made me cry. do you want to know why it made me cry (i am referring to the mass market 4-in-1 book)???? i cried because i spent seventy dollars for this ""classic"" edition hearing how good this piece of crap was, so i was like, "" hey, why not???"" i struggled through the hobbit and the fellowship of the ring before i cried. another reason i cried was because THEY SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! i have read the sword of shannara by terry brooks and even though it followed the same plot, it was a billion times better than this piece of b.s.! I mean, what's up with those defunktitated songs?! bend the forks and break the plates! that's what bimbo (hahaha) bagginontolkienreaders hates! were all you LotR lovers brainwashed by him or something????? this was the worst book ever written!!!!! i mean, curious george goes to the zoo had more class than this book did!!!!"
5,Better than the Movies,"This is my first read of the Tolkien series - and I really enjoyed it. I waited until I saw all the movies first. His descriptions are terrific, this can be seen in the movies, which match the books quite well. Ideal reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy reading."
5,I love the book the Hobbit!,"In the Hobbit it is like you are in a universe with hard obsticals, bad enemys, and really cool friends! I am about 3/4 through The Fellowship of the Rings. It's a great book. J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite author by far. They may be long but they're REALLY good."
4,Can't beat it!,Good price for a series of books I have been wanting to read for some time. Great communication with the seller and I'm satisfied with my purchase.
2,Over rated,"I dont want to give anyone a heart attack or something, but this trilogy isnt that great... in fact, it was rather crappy. The entire thing was more like a really long childrens book with no pictures... and i read it when i was a kid. (well, i still am, 14, but then i was 12) sorry if i offended anyone"
5,Great buy,"If you like fantasy novels, this is the genesis of it all... The hobbit is about to be out at the movies so it may be time to read or in many peoples cases re-read it"
3,Shipping,I orderend the book from the USA to ship to Serbia.The shipping was one month early wich was great bu the box was damaged slightley (there is an dent on one corner).But the Hobbit book has a small hole in.The other books are ok but i was disapointed with the dent bos and the small hole.
5,Simply the best.,"I wanted to voice my opinion on this, but I don't wish to bore anyone with a long, drawn-out dialogue on a subject that many others have already given credit to. Therefore, I shall merely point out that novels that have a longevity beyond a single generation as a respected and prolific work are simply in a league of their own. This work rises to the top of that small selection, and is the standard by which ALL writing is set."
5,"Small Reader, Good book!!!!!","I know that whoever reads this is probably a grownup, but I am ten and have read The Hobbit and I think it is the best book ever! My dad recomended it to me so I got it. Ithink it is a good book so I recomend it to all people who haven't read IT IS A GOOD BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not really worth the price...,"I just got the box set today and I'll start out with the box part. There IS no box. It's just the four books wrapped in bubblewrap and shipped! The first and fourth book is in an okay-ish condition but the second and third had part of the covers ripped off (seriously?). I'm tempted to return them and replace them with newer versions but that'll be a huge hassle.I don't know about the typos or anything, but I checked out the maps and I wasn't sure if they were the ones in the original stories, but who knows. I'll probably come back and write a review on the quality of the book when i've finished them"
3,"A good fantasy book, but for kids","This book was good, with some vivid descriptions and good fantasy. However, I felt the plot was sometimes too contrived. I'm sure I would have enjoyed this book as a kid, but I read it close on the heels of Harry Potter, which I loved, and my mind started making annoying comparisons between the two series, and I found Harry Potter to be much better. It is not my intention to compare the two, but I felt that if you read it as a kid, you would have liked it and liked re-reading it as well. If you are an adult, then go for it only if you are a fantasy buff."
5,"Awesome program, now FREE from Google","This is a great program that makes managing hundreds of digital photos very simple and intuitive. As a power user I crave more advanced options and settings, and I have yet to find a program that does exactly what *I* want. But I never hesitate to recommend Picasa to friends and family. Especially now that Google has bought the company that makes Picasa and made it a FREE download!! Get yours at http://www.picasa.com/google/ and have fun :-)"
4,Well-made and comfortable,"This seat has metal hinges and seems like it will hold up to a lot of abuse. We have an older toilet, and while the seat doesn't fit PERFECTLY (there is a slight overhang on the front), it is not noticeable and doesn't seem to affect the performance of the seat. The opening on the kid seat is slightly large for my less-than-average-size 2-year-old, but I doubt I want anything much smaller because she can use it for a longer time this way."
5,"fast paced book, throughally entertaining","Sam Adams, a journalist, has never really known his father.

4,Nature at it's worst in the middle ages.,"Once again Daniel P. Mannix shows his prowess as a historical documentor. The author of ""Those Who Are About To Die"" and ""The Hell Fire Club"" takes us back to France in the middle ages and an ancient Paris under siege from a pack of bloodthirsty wolves. More than just a historical account, Mannix, in his typically engrossing style takes us into the life of the wolf pack, revealing to the reader the lifestyle of a wolf in medieval europe, and the unforseen outcome when nature's boundries are crossed. A bit more heavily fictionalized than Mannix's other works, and somewhat anthropomorphic, but if you're a nature lover with an interest in mideval history this ones for you. Warning: graphically violent...otherwise it wouldn't be Mannix."
2,Wish they would all work,After charging the batteries i noticed that one battery did not take a charge. For the money i paid for these i expect them all to work!
2,"Good price, not so good tool.","This spokeshave arrived with a defective blade. The edge is chipped and one of the eyelets meant to hold one of the two adjustment knobs is badly misshapen. The body of the tool is okay though, save for the sole not being very smooth.Overall, don't buy this. Instead, go find yourself a vintage spokeshave at an antique store or flea market."
1,Where's the real info anyway?,"I bought this book for my wife upon the birth of our child. We travel often and were hoping for some actual information that would help us TRAVEL with our baby, we already knew what to pack when visiting our neighbor. We were bored out of our minds listening to stories about the author's 'little junior'- don't waist your money on this one! We are still looking for a book with REAL information concerning the technicalities of traveling with our baby."
3,Ok...,"This textbook has some good info but is very outdated. The pRB stuff is completely wrong, though. There are better textbooks available."
5,Fine Text,"""A fine text...good photography and special emphasis on new developments, treatments, and diagnostic techniques."" (Journal of the American Association of Forensic Dentists, Volume 10-12, 2002)"
2,Broken,Have used and loved this product before but when this arrived it was broken. The smudger side completely fell off when I opened it and is no longer functional.
3,Amish Quilts,"I recommend this book to any experienced or inexperienced quilter--especially those who are interested in the Amish people. It has excellent, easy to follow patterns that are all about the same size, and it includes some beautiful quilting designs that are also easy to follow and easy to use. The ideas for color schemes and traditional Amish patterns are very useful. I especially liked the way pictures were included in order to illustrate the origins of certain quilt designs. For instance, a picture of a barn window is included with the pattern that represents a barn window. I found the religious themes in the book, and in the quilts themselves, very interesting. I really enjoyed using this book, and I am very satisfied with the quilt that I made using the patterns and designs provided in the book. This book is a helpful guide to quiltmaking, and the cultural information it includes is a very interesting supplement to anyone interested in quilt history or Christianity."
4,Love and other things,"This French film is based on a true story. It concerns five friends; four young men and a woman. The central characters are brother and sister; one year apart. They love each other intensely. The film oscillates between the present investigation into the murder of one of the characters and how things were before that event; blissful, intense in some ways and musically strong. The four boys are a rock band. To say more would give the plot away. I shall certainly watch it again.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
4,My daughter took this one,I did not get to listen much to this album. My daughter took off with it to Wisconsin. SO...But I did like hearing the first time.
4,Give Every Song a Chance,"I am probably one of the biggest VS fans ever, and I wasn't sure quite what to think at first. But a lot of albums are like that to me... so after the second listen, I was in love. It's funny though, because with all of VS's singles, I've always thought they could have picked much better ones than they did. So again with this album, the songs they have on myspace are not my favorites. There were only 3 of the 14 that I'm still not quite feeling, but other than that, Louise & Co. have again done an excellent job, with each project having a unique feel. My only advice is to listen to each song in it's entirety. The mid to end of most tunes are much stronger than the beginnings, so just give each song a chance!!"
4,"Sleek, good sounding powered monitors",I purchased these speakers mainly to play my iPod/iMod or Edirol R-09 recorder/player. They ended up as monitors on my PC desk. Here's what I found out from them:1) Their digital/line 1 (SPDIF/Toslink/mini) sounds much better than line 2 (RCA).2) Their 24/192 digital line is a welcome please feature that extends their usefullness. I can connect and play to them anything from MP3 to hi-res digital.3) Their shape and build are first rate IMHO. It's nice to have a pair of Edirol monitors to amplify an Edirol R09.
5,Give it,"Give It All to HimMax Lucado is the ""Nora Roberts"" of the religious genre. Makes a great gift. Find a comfortable chair, kick back and enjoy a good read that will help you understand better God and how you relate to HIM. Just cannot go wrong when you read anything by Max Lucado. Rate this as a ""10""."
5,Gave it All to Jesus,"Self-reliance is deceiving. Anger does kill your soul. This book made me realize what I have been carrying around. It brought me to tears to realize what Jesus really did when he brought our sins to the cross and died for us. His pure love for us promises that we can give anything to Jesus, even broken commandments, and they will be forgiven if we only ask. Amen.Thank you for such a wonderful book Max. I feel so much better!"
5,Perfect Book!,I bought this for my Girlfriend and she loves it! This is a perfect book and quick shipping! The price is also very good for hat you're getting!
1,Windy Brenday,"Max Lucado has a unique way of writing that gets a point across. I have always enjoyed his books as they make you stop and think about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit in a different way. I have read many of his books and will continue to read whatever he writes!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Underwater oddities.This is a movie novelisation, and a pretty decent job. In fact, in this case I like it more than the other, which was rather tedious, so I can recommend the book as far as that goes.As far as the story goes, underwater explorers find something definitely not human, and some of the new gear they are trying gets used to try and help understand and communicate."
3,Not my favorite,"I was so excited to try this, but I was a bit disappointed. First of all, it has a grainy texture and herbal smell/taste that I am not fond of. It isn't the most moisturizing lip balm I've used either. There are others that I am now using that are far better. Aubrey Organics and Simply are my two faves!"
4,Interesting,"Beware, this is not a release of newly-recorded material! Recorded over various sessions in the late 80's early 90's this set was originally released as a single CD on Konnex called ""Today, This Moment"". It works better for me as a single disc; what is interesting though is the inclusion of bassoonist Micheal Rabinowitz's 2 compositions (not featured on the Konnex disc). Perhaps not surprisingly Dave Douglas's compositions are the most interesting and self-assured, Superconductor particularly leaning towards his later writing for the string band. A particular downside is the out-of-tune piano (the scourge of many jazz recordings unfortunately!). Historically an important recorded document and for Dave Douglas fans a must if you havn't got the earlier German release. Mick Rossi's new quintet with Dave and Andy Laster on Knitting Factory is a must!"
5,"A terrific, ""user friendly"" guide for serious musicians.","John Hedtke and Sandy Bradley's MP3 For Musicians is packed with details on how a musician might present music on the web, from communicating with fans and deciding how to feature one's music to locating additional resources on the web and understanding and using basic MP3 resources. Highly recommended: the specific information tailored to musicians is unparalleled."
4,nice,"i like the book, but wish it was a little different than the Quiero a mi papa book since we purchased both.Otherwise. Very sweet book to read to baby. love that it is bilingual"
5,Me encanta. I Love it.,The book is well made. The translation is great. Easy to read and I love that it has the name of the animals. My husband got alittle sensitive and now we have purchased: I love my daddy--Quiero a mi papa...Excellent. I will give away to my bilingual friends.
1,A nasty album....,"From the people who makes the mexican tv show ""La Academia"" here it comes a singer from Sonora....Her voice sounds like the old 90s singer, Gloria Trevi, and all her covers sounds awful...Is a good tool for people that loves to torture others, just put the cd 5 times and the victim could confess anything...Is the worst gift you can give to your best friends... Avoid it!!!!"
5,Read Alice Steinbach's first book...had to read more ...,I first picked up Ms. Steinbach's 'Without Reservations' as I love to read travel essays and this was one I truly loved. Alice Steinbach quit her job as a reporter and took a year off to tour the world and write about her adventures and her everyday life in different countries. She makes you feel as though you're there with her.When I finished 'Without Reservations' I had to Google the author to find out what else she'd written. 'Educating Alice' is just as brilliant as her first book and I only hope she'll continue on her travels and write more more!! One of the best travel essay writers hands down.
5,Great travel book,"I really enjoyed Educating Alice because it gives a fresh take on travel and education. Each of the learning experiences Alice has is unique. I would like to know more about her relationship with Naohiro, although since the book is a travel/educational experience book, perhaps the author intends to write about her relationship with Naohiro in a different book."
2,"Good storyline and world, didn't dig the prose/style","I randomly picked this book up from the local library, and while reading it was simultaneously entertained and annoyed.Zielinski uses a unique style of writing which is unusual, and, quite frankly, didn't appeal to me. Take a look at a page or two before you buy this, to see if you can stand it.If you can stand the style, then you will appreciate the characters, world, and environment he has created. I was particularly fond of the characterization of anything worth buying being priced in terms other than money. The various forms of currency, and the system of magic that seemed to reside behind it, are unique and interesting.Overall, a 2 of 5. I just couldn't finish it..."
5,This book is SO funny!,This book was really good.This book is really great because it makes you feel like a kid wrote the book instead of an author.It was so good that I read it in one day because I could not put it down.It was great and I can't wait to read more Amelia books!
2,Too much bla bla!,"Not of particular use to a new user of ipods. The author attempted to do two books in one by using a dule discription for each procedure (Mac and PC). In addition, too much history of why such and such was included. I felt this time consuming and unnecessary. The index was sadly lacking and many important topics were not to be found."
2,not as good,I found the male character not that interesting and liked the antagonist more. It was a story well told but I found myself skipping some more tedious part of the plot. The ending was not what I was hoping for. Devin should have got a better ending. I do like the author's book and they make for intelligent reading.
5,"Thorough, through and through","After numerous trips to Florida and parts of the Caribbean I had developed a homesickness for the exotic. I bought the book and read it three times before gaining enough confidence to act. Two windmills, a mexican fan and one washingtonian later, I'm seeing surviving palms in my yard. If you're looking for good science for gardening, this is your book."
4,Ten little fingers,"Very similar to Head, shoulders, knees and toes by Annie Kubler. Very bright, attractive visuals on good thick board. I wanted more pages it felt too short."
3,Good but not great,"This is a good album but not the Monkees at their best. That honor goes to Headquaters with Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. a close second. This album is more like their 5th album Birds, the Bees and the Monkees. It has some stand out songs with Heart and Soul, Every Step of the Way and Secret Heart. Mostly the guys just did the vocals. They recorded the songs and were busy with a tour at the time. Like the 60's when they were busy touring AND doing a TV series. But music is about if it is sounds good not who played on it. If you are a fan of the Monkees then get this album/CD. The songs mentioned above are almost worth the price by themselves."
5,Great for young boys and girls,This is a terrific book for girls as well as boys. Itintroduces space science in a fun and engaging way and it shows younggirls that they can be space explorers as well. I'm looking forward to the whole series.
4,Like someone opened a drawer full of butterflies,"from songs that swing to songs that open the rainy window to delicious melancholy, the poll winners were voted the top of the heap on their respective instruments. God bless their idea to record together. Instrumental prowess is no longer valued in american musical culture, but this is an excellent example of a time when it was. A guitar trio dripping with talent. After hearing one of their albums, I had to have the other two. For fans of jazz guitar, bass, drums."
5,Subversive ear candy,"It would be easy to listen to a few minutes of TBM and dismiss them as just so much gothpop fluff, but that would be a mistake. This is a musically tight group that knows its stuff and subverts the pop aesthetic in such a deliciously evil and infectiously fun way that it's hard not to smile when listening to it. If Joss Whedon of Buffy fame were to create a goth group, one can imagine The Birthday Massacre would be the result."
5,Only four reviews?,"I'm not an expert on this band, but ever since I heard ""Violet"" on a website I've been addicted to them. It's so great to have music like this released now a days. I personally find their music to have everything to be qualified as goth rock, but the splash of upbeatness makes it differnt, in a good way of course.I enjoy the vocals alot too, wonderful voice.And I'd agree with what the other person said about them going hand in hand with LAM. When I first heard TBMthey were the first band that I could consider comparing them too.So, all in all, this cd is definitly a great buy."
4,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"All of the songs on this album follow the same format...they begin with hardrock guitar sounds..the lyric sections are backed by a layer of 1980's pop beats..and the chorus sections take you into the whole neo gothic metal feel. Despite the consistency of this album...it's quite catchy and hard not to like. Unique female vocals, excellent musicianship, and overall, with this being a debute album, The Birthday Massacre have invented a style of thier own. as for thier perky image, they do look like another dark and bubbly ""Hot Topic Band""...But, in truth, they are kinda creative and original. If your not caught up in being a gothicly correct purist who thinks all new music is fluff...you'll probably find yourself enjoying this album. It's different...yes, it's verry, verry, goth, ...but it's also kinda fun and playful in an unusual way. It's a good record. Well worth taking a chance on."
5,Great Firearms Law Reference,"This guide is an essential part of the reference material for anyone that owns firearms, especially if you travel with them or if you carry concealed.This is a replacement for the one I bought several years ago. The updates to the laws are important to track.I highly recommend this guide."
3,Hohum,Not a bad introduction to Mendelssohn's most famous collection of piano music but those who are familiar with these pieces may find the tempi annoying. In my opinion the beautiful Duetto is taken too slowly and the equally memorable E-flat Op. 32 No. 1 is far too quick and disjointed.Daniela Ruso has a steely tone and these renditions suffer from a lack of imagination in interpretation. I also bought Peter Nagy's set on the Naxos label and would highly recommend that for both new and seasoned Mendelssohnians. It's much more feisty.
3,"wonderful pianist, wrong drummer","Tommy Flanagan was a wonderful pianist. Even on less than interesting material, he was never less than a top-notch piano player. But I can't agree that this was the right setting for him. Tony Williams may have been a genius with Miles Davis, but here breaks up the rhythm and is generally a nuisance; miles away from the sympathetic drumming of a Joe Chambers or a Lewis Nash. Ron Carter's bass has the ugly over-amplified plastic sound that marred so many of Bill Evans' recordings with Eddie Gomez. There are better trio records with Flanagan out there. Go for the ones with Reggie Workman and Joe Chambers, or Kenny Wahington and Lewis Nash."
3,v-2 ophile,"Anybody who wishes so see the camoflague patterns of the famous V-2 rocket, will get what they wish. I wish that it was a more lengthly pamphlet but I guess nothing else could be said."
2,"""A Disease just like cancer""--he doesn't make the case","I too got bored with the self-pity permeating this book. There's also something a bit ""off"" about the author repeatedly making the case, in one way or the other, that depression is a disease, has nothing to do with character, we shouldn't judge suicides as lacking in some way cause they're dealing with so much pain, etc.But...against these arguments is the author's own history. He abused alcohol for 40 years, and admits he used it to avoid dealing with strong emotions. And, he didn't stop out of any sense of responsibility to himself or those around him, but because his aging body couldn't tolerate it anymore. With this background, is it all surprising he fell into a depression?And maybe it is helpful to place blame, if for no other reason than to be honest and not leave readers with the impression that depression is a disease like any other, that strikes out of the blue. In this case, the author reaped exactly what he sowed."
2,defines depression,"If you know someone who suffers from depression and wanta clue into what the experience is, this is the book.I myself suffer from depression and was always had pressed to explain to anotherwhat it was like. Styron does not have difficulty doing it.""Feeling the wind from the wings of madness"""
1,Frustrating and (I felt) inaccurate portrayal,"This book was very frustrating for me to read, I do not feel like Styron painted a very accurate portrayal of depression, he seemed to believe that is a disease that you get and then can just get over and he leaves out many factors which should probably carry a lot more weight (he was an alcoholic for years, and he suffered some childhood trauma, which he does not elaborate upon). Also the way he both decides to live and the way in which he overcomes his depression seems glib and unrealistic."
4,Darkness,"This book was a lecture given at a symposium in Baltimore in 1979 sponsored by the Department of Psychiatry of the John Hopkins University School of Medicine and also appeared in Vanity Fair.It is deeply personal about William Styron and how he dealt with the darkness in his own life, depression. It began after he quit drinking or actually drinking quit him because his body reacted to alcohol and he simply could not drink it.We all deal with depression at some point of our lives and for some folks it grabs hold of them. However this book is a good read to get an intimate portrait of the darkness."
1,worst ending ever!,"The character and the plot is compelling, making me stay up all night to finish the book. However,the book really sets out to disappoint the reader again and again, focusing on the fallout of Basil and Therion. The make up between them only mentioned in a sentence or not mentioned at all, ie. the ending. Therion's emotion and thought are all over the place, making him a weak character.The ending is the worst ending of all the novels I've read. This book definately not for those looking for a feel-good story."
4,Pretty Good,"Ok so I was in the Marines so I've used one of these packs a lot. Its a brand new item that is in better shape than any thing we were ever issued. It came with the shoulder straps that matched this pack in color. (big plus) The shoulder straps did have some signs of use on the hardware (paint worn on the edges) There is nothing wrong with this pack at all everything works as it should. the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating is I received a LC-1 pack. The only difference between a LC-1 and a LC-2 is the buckles. I personally spent more time using the LC-2 style buckles and would have preferred those type but the LC-1 buckles are growing on me, they seem like they hold better."
3,Good but dated.,"The book gives a good high-level primer on componentware, focusing on OLE-COM architecture, and then goes into MapObjects examples. MapObjects has advanced since the publication of this book, but it is still useful for beginners."
1,This book is bad!,"This book is soooo boring! I can't stand it, everyday I try to read more and it just goes on and on. I highly suggest not buying it."
4,a resource,This is a reader-friendly resource. It gives a general overview of the history of food. .... and a good starting point for a pursuit of more information.
2,Meh,"I love history. I love food. This book should have been a no-brainer. However, the best I can say is that it is ""meh"". Is it well researched? Generally yes, although I found one very obvious flaw- when describing Columbus' encounter with man eating Caribs, the author was blatantly innacurate. Columbus never actually saw the Caribs; he only heard about them from the Taino.Aside from that, I found the book to be a tad dull which is a shame- just because a book is of an academic nature does not mean that it needs to be boring. The exception was the section on Medieval gas passing:}"
5,Best franch rap album ever.,"I grew up listening to this album. Since then I moved to the US and I just pick it back up, and it still great."
5,Truly impressive,"The Timber Press has been publishing gardening books for quite a few years now and appears quite devoted to turning out good-looking books. This striving for perfection is not limited to looks only but includes content: the Timber Press is perhaps the only publishing company to get the ""hybrid sign"" right (i.e. following the ICBN). In this book they also follow recent developments in taxonomy as concerns recent reassignments as to family.It is clear that this devoted publishing company found an author devoted to making good-looking photographs and the result is a stunning book, that will be treasured by anyone who cares about trees. It is as close to a real life viewing of the trees as I ever experienced.This book will look superb on a coffee table or on a reference shelf. It will make a great gift to just about anybody. Let's hope this splendid overview of a neglected aspect of trees is not an incident but a promise of many other beautiful books to come."
3,Disappointing,"I am not sure what I was expecting with this book, but I was expecting infinitely more than it delivered. It ranges from simplistic to numbingly technical. It essentially tells one that bark is so dependent upon the circumstances in which a tree finds itself, that bark cannot be reliably described with a set of characteristics that might lead to an identifying standard for each sort of tree. And then it poses an admittedly arbitrary system for such desription and classification.Ok, the photography is quite good. But really, you can better spend your botany library dollars elsewhere."
4,Sennheiser RS140 Wireless Headphones,"The headphones are great. The sound quality is excellent. Set up was a breeze. The only negative aspect is that they are a bit heavy, and because they cover the ears completely, the ears get a little hot - there's probably no solution for that. Still a good buy."
2,heavy buzzing at any distance,"I hope this product works for everyone else because I checked all my electrical and electronic products in the area, turned them off, except for the TV that I am trying to listen too and I still get a heavy buzz. Too much to be able to hear the TV."
3,comfortable but...,"It is quite comfortable to wear; however, much bulkier than my Sennheiser HDR-65. I was hoping for very clear, static-free reception, but from only 11 feet away it gives out a buzzing sound when I turn my head either to the right or left. On the other hand, I have walked around the corner into another room and still can hear the sound from the TV! Go figure! Weird. It buzzes every so often, and yes I have tried tuning it. Could it be interference from the Pioneer Pro plasma t.v.? Sound is clearer and warmer than the HDR-65. Overall, I think it is o.k. product."
1,Don't waste your mony on this very expensive junk.,"These are nearly useless. The volume must be regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. You have to stay oriented to the transmitter, no swivel chairs. Get a wired set if you want to feel your music.The headphones, are an RF receiver, and they are directional. Turn your head, and the audio fades. Get a wired set. The volume on these is weak at best."
1,Sounds like listening over a cordless phone circa 1985,"The headphones are comfortable enough, and other newer Sennheiser models are probably fine, but the RS 140 model uses analog RF technology. In this day and age, unless you are using them inside a faraday cage, analog RF is not going to be very listenable -- nowhere near as good as a wired connection.I have several pairs of wireless digital speakers in my home, plus two sets of speakers attached to Apple AirTunes receivers, and all of them work flawlessly if you stay within range. That is the experience I expected for a $150 pair of wireless headphones purchased in 2009. I did not realize that these used simple analog RF transmission; I thought that the RF description was meant to indicate that they did not use infrared technology like some other headphones used to.Put simply, these are not the headphones you want. Sennheiser makes several other models that do use digital tech. Try one of those."
4,Good Headset,"I just got them and I have only used them a few times, but I like them a lot, great sound quality, comfortable. I recommend them."
1,Way too much hissing,"I just sent these back and ordered the 170s. There is way too much hissing. It is extremely annoying. I tried switching channels a million times, moving the base, etc. Occasionally it would work and I would have great sound for a minute, but then came the hissing. I really hope the 2.4GHz of the 170s does not have this problem."
1,Very Poor Range,These headphones work great if you are within 20 feet of the tranmitter. As soon as I walk into another room the reception starts getting noisy. Two rooms away or about 45 feet the reception starts breaking up and is very noisy. The number of walls between the headphones and transmitter seem to be the biggest factor in reducing the useable range. More than three walls and they stop working all together. Unless you have a very large open space with few or no obstacles I would recommend you get a good set of wired headphones with a long cord as I wish I had done.
1,Ok book,Pretty apalled by all the meanness in this book. Forced myself to finish it. makes me not want to read the others...
1,"Please, gag me","I've been reading V.C. Andrews novels since I was 12. They have always kept me guessing and amazed at the craziness of the characters. However, I found Jennifer and Reuben completely unbelieveable characters. Granted, there are a rather large amount of broken homes, but Jennifer and Reuben are so unrealistic. And Raven! All of a sudden, she moves away from her terrible mother and in with her evil uncle. And what does she do? She starts going to school and doing her homework? What the... If anything, I'd expect her to do worse. The only (absolutely only) good thing about this book is she didn't come from that silly orphanage the other three came from. This story was slightly more original than the first three. Slightly."
1,Taking facts to wrong conclusions,"The author lost any remaining credibility with his assertion that the Framers wanted a strong central government with professional politicians. He draws this remarkable conclusion from the fact that the Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation, which were inadequate to moderate the business of the new nation. He chooses to neglect or diminish the many limitations placed on Federal power to enhance his personal belief that strong central government is best.Similarly, he points to the replacement of the AofC's one-year tenured delegates with two- and six-year tenured Congressmen and Senators as proof that the framers had abandoned the idea of the citizen (non-professional) legislator.Read this book - if you can borrow it. Save your spending money for a more balanced offering."
1,What Government?,"It is astounding how learned and educated people, like Professor Wills, can spend years reading the Founders and yet miss the main point: that an arbitrary and irresponsible government, such as we have now, where administrative agencies write, enforce, and judge their own laws, is the very definition of tyranny. I love my country and would love to have a Constitutional government, but I hate as much as Washington and Jefferson would anyone who is busying trying to turn American into Germany, which I fear is what people like Wills really want to do."
5,Sir Paul never fails to please.,"Saw the PBS presentation and knew the video would make a great Christmas gift for my nephew, who is an awesome musician/guitarist, himself. I almost decided to keep it for myself, since the classic songs Paul chose, from the American Songbook, were songs he recalled and loved from his childhood. Many of you will remember them, too, as they are the tunes that stay in your head and you find that you remember ALL the lyrics, even after all these years. Paul also includes his new song, ""My Valentine"", accompanied by the great Joe Walsh (James Gang and Eagles) on guitar. Paul's wonderful running commentary, along with interviews with the likes of Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Diana Krall and the show's producer, Tony LiPuma and others, add much to the presentation. I guarantee that you'll be singing along, as you take this delightful walk down memory lane. I know, I did."
5,Wonderful,"This is maybe the greatest album of Paul in the latest years. I saw Live kisses during a flight and I had to see it almost three times. A wonderful experience entirely, I really enjoyed it."
3,Cable is only 3' long.,"Quality is great. However, be carefull if you really need a 4' cable, you might end up short and have to start cutting holes in furniture like I did. This cable is only 39"" long, not 48"". I bought 2 and they were both the same length."
3,No Big Deal,"After considerable on-line research, I bought these Monster component cables for our new HDTV (a Sony LCD). I first connected them from our DVD player to the TV but couldn't see any noticeable improvement over the component cables provided by Comcast (when we ordered the HD cable box). I next connected the Monster cables from the HD cable box to the HDTV and again did not see any noticeable improvement over the Comcast component cables. We got a great result with both DVDs and HDTV channels using the Comcast cables. So I ended up returning the Monster cables to Amazon."
1,TERRIBLE FIT,"The connectors on these cables are WAY TOO THICK!!! They really don't fit on the component jacks on my BRAND NEW SAMSUNG LCD TV OR my DVD player! I had to force them on, it made horrific crunching sounds, and I probably damaged my equipment from pushing so hard on the jacks and spreading them apart because of the girth of these things. As you can see in the above pic, they can't fit side by side, so the jacks are forced to spread apart. I have really never been so angry, and I feel like suing monster. Oh yeah, and THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TERRIBLE! My S-video looked much better, now I have interference lines. Do not go with Monster, they are an outrageous joke."
2,No improvement for SD TV,"I bought these cables thinking there would be some sort of improvement over the normal A/V cable where the is only 1 cable for video and 2 for audio. I have a 46"" Samsung, but currently I am only watching Standard Definition. Maybe these cables do their job for HD, but there they are no better than the cheap A/V. This also could be from the signal or box from Charter. Ill have to try it with my DVD player and see if there is a difference."
5,FINALLY!!!!,"I've been a fan of these guys since 91' when I first heard ""Jerry was a racecar driver"", and I have had the hugest respect for these guys as musicians. They are a band that you can ""get"" only if you are a musician as well. Most people find them ""weird"" or ""annoying"", but they aren't LISTENING to Primus, they just hear them. I think its about time that this band got a greatest hits album. Once thing, I think they should have included ""Sgt. Baker"" from Seas of Cheese."
5,Great Guide,"Great book that helped me understand a problem that very complicated and hard to understand. The book breaks things down in a really easy to understand but smart way, and I like the way it is broken up into ""choices"", which are the different solutions that are out there.I got another book by these guys and I think the books are just perfect for a person to get up speed on a public issue. It says in the back that you can use them in discussion groups, although my wife and I just used ours to read. Either way, I really like how the book presents the information to make it easy to understand the ""why"" and ""what can be done"" of a really upsetting problem. I thought it was even better that they included specific actions you could take depending on what ""choice"" you agree with. I don't like books that just define a problem and leave you hanging. This one didn't!Thumbs up from the big apple! My wife and I were really impressed and I feel like I understand the issue alot better."
2,This thing is not worth the pay!!,This dictionary is not worth the pay. I bought this at [cost] and it broke 1 week later. Don't think about calling Seiko because they just say that they can fix the screen (If it breaks) for [higher cost]! Buy something that is a little more worth it !And this saying botton on the dictionary is Very stupid! You can Hardly hear the word because the person saying the stuff says it WAY TOO FAST. Dont buy this worthless peice of doodoo!!
2,not rigid thin tubing,the picture might lead you to believe it is the thin rigid tubing such as ones used for under gravel filters. It's just a see through hose with thick walls.
3,Talk about insight!,"Having been a student of the Bible all my life and having lived in a deeply religious community, I have tended to accept most of the intimations that were made in the New Testament concerning a woman's place in the home and in the church.I learned from this book that the King James scholar had a hidden agenda. King James instucted his scholars that the translation should maintain the status quo and support authority. The details that the author brings out are fascinating!A ""must read"" for women and men who want more Biblecal background."
1,Completely non-biblical,"This book completely leaves out most texts that Paul writes to Timothy and Titus. This book's author does not believe in the infallibility of scripture. In many cases the author uses God's Word in a haphazard manner. When a scripture is obviously discussing a woman's role to be the helper and supporter of her husband, the author will...try and make the scriptures say something else.If you don't want to believe in gender roles established in the Bible by lying to yourself, then this book would be a great read for you. However, anyone truly seeking what God says about biblical manhood and womanhood would be much better served to read elsewhere..."
4,Excellent Product,Really great product that is simple to use. I gave it a four star only because the lid seal seems to leak a little letting water drip from the side of the lid. I really like the fact that it has an insert pot to put the items being cooked so they do not touch the bottom of the pot. Overall it is an excellent product.
4,Giovanni Hair Care,My only problem was not with the product - I just didn't receive it in a timely manner - but when I complanined about not receiving it I was sent another pkj that arrived in a few days. That solved the problem
5,Lovely hair....,Makes my naturally kinky-curly hair feel soft. Has a very nice texture and lovely smell. A little goes a long way.
4,Fits very well with the story,"Quite good music, although it can be collected in various compilations of classic music, this selection fits perfectly in the animation, and is a very good addition to the animation soundtrack.The versions of certain tracks have a distinctive touch that enhance dramatically the story in Gankutsuou."
2,"Too Brief, but there are High Points","This book tackles the subject of Jack Kerouac. After reading this text, I found myself asking ""Is that it?"" These are literally the shortest chapters I have ever seen, with several of them spanning only 2 or 3 pages. Compared with the other biographies I've read, this one is too brief and, in a place or two, seems to draw primarily from heresay.What I liked about this book was that it gave Kerouac a dimension of humanity. Too many biographies dissect their subjects with a mortician's instinct, and succeed in removing those people any trace of humanity they possessed in life - who they loved, hated, and what their failings were. For hard-core Kerouac fans, this book should be read, but only in addition to other Kerouac biographies to fill the holes in this one."
4,Fun for kids.,"My 7 year old grandson loves this game. If you play the game all the way through, you can go back to any of the challenges and play any or all of them over (as many time as you like) to improve your score. My grandson loves the challenge where Tak changes into a chicken suit. After a while, it would probably be pretty boring for an older child, but for right now, it's keeping a 7 year old happy for as long as I will allow him to play."
4,Good Study Companion,"A great, well formatted book. A lot of exercises and well thought out labs. Quite a lot of spelling and grammatical errors but that doesn't distract from the content. A word of warning, don't use this book as your sole study guide as there are areas that are out of date. Especially in the areas of SUS and some of the improved areas surrounding Service Pack 1.A good book overall. Well worth the money!"
2,Warning: Salon.com,"Salon.com and other ezine writters should be required to warn buyers with a special jacket label. This book was funny only because I was in the mood to read something light-hearted and comedic. But there's nothing special about this book. Obvious humor-writing formulas with the particular degree of humor that Salon writers are known for. The author swears every story is true, but there are just so many cases where its obvious a few yarns were spun. The retail worker who got tired of her desk? Anyone who's ever worked retail knows you don't get a desk (you dream of a desk). You're lucky if you geta locker. Mediocre writing at best."
4,Freedom Writers DVD,This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift. My husband really enjoys this movie. The DVD had good quality sound and picture.
3,Liked it better than I thought I would; but I can't imagine Gruwell's co-workers are thrilled,"I liked Freedom Writers more than I thought I would, mostly because of Hilary Swank, who is likable and talented. While not in full-out Oscar mode here, she's passionate and moving in her portrayal of then-Long Beach high school teacher Erin Gruwell. It's a compelling tale. The ensemble playing her students is great, too. For many, this is their first time on screen. Of particular note, April Hernandez is outstanding in the role of Eva.On the other hand, this movie suffers from its one-dimensional, negative portrayal of any adult - husband, co-educator, administrator - not sharing Gruwell's vision. It simply can't be the case that each of these people, in their real-life incarnations, is as shallow and mean-spirited as depicted here. I can't imagine any adult from this phase of Gruwell's life - save her father - being pleased with their ham-handed on-screen characterization."
1,never see this movie,"I'm so tired of movies glorifying the white woman as the savior of communities of color. I wouldn't watch freedom writers to save my life,how about watching freedomland its got a white woman in it."
4,April Hernandez- star in the making,"Very good movie based on real life events, April Hernandez is a star in the making. Hilary Swank was awesome as usual, good feel good movie."
4,truth is powerful,Don't get discouraged by the painfull beginning. The kids' stories are powerful and you can take some inspiration from them. Swank saves the movie from the mediocre.
5,Near Excellence...,"Excellent movie. The topics it touches up on are real and true.Movie is about this teacher (Swank) who is going to teach Freshman and Sophomore English at a Los Angeles school during the 1990's. At this time, there are a lot of racial issues and the school she is teaching at has basically gone down the drain. Theres fights everyday, students carry weapons, etc. She begins to learn the lives of her students and attempts to make a change so that her students can succeed.Excellent story. It portrays very nicely how these types of issues can lead to deadly violence and how the right education and support can help people succeed. Great acting. Great plot. Great directing.It does start to drag a little at the end and the ending is too perfect, but its minute details that dont keep this movie from being one of the best ive seen in a while. And surprisingly, it was associated with MTV films, who's films are mediocre at best."
5,Freedom Writers,"I love this movie. It gives us an understanding about what really goes on in the life of children who are out in the streets gangbanging, doing drugs, having sex and getting pregnant. Children who don't do well in school, they just think that nobody cares, so why should they put effort in to it. They need that one person with tons of patience and willingness to guide them through the light and let them see that there is someone who cares enough to help them fight and help them to reach there goals. Love it, love it love it. My daughter introduced this movie to me, and fell in love with it. I had mentioned to her ""Dangerous Minds"" also a great movie!!! She saw it also, and loved it as well."
2,NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THE HARD MONKEY,"NOT EXACTLY WHAT i EXPECTED. lOOKING FOR A SOFT FLOPPY BEST FRIEND FOR MY GRANDSON.THIS MONKEY IS VERY FIRM, STIFF , HARD."
1,Network Operation Centre,"If you are looking for a document to help you build a Network Operation Centre than this is not the document for you. This is a six page document which tells the reader briefly what is SNMP, RMON, and varies network management platforms. It has a page full of links to companies like -Nortel, 3COM, IntelThis document should have been named ""Network Management Software""I expected it to help me build a NOC....best practices, change management etc."
5,Excellent Unit all around,"After returning the disapointing Jornada 568, I decided to stick with the iPAQ line after owning the 3630 since October 2000. I'm so glad I made that choice. The screen is brilliant (Could use some contrast controls especially in viewing pictures, but I'm sure that will be worked on) and extremely clear and DUSTLESS. The Jornada was heavily polluted with dust particles and was plagued with an uneven backlight. The iPAQ light is uniformly lit all around. The sound quality is crisp and clear and has replaced my RioVolt SP250 as my music device. The bass controls work well. Games are fun to play on the unit, and the unit comes with a hefty 64MB of RAM. Overall, I would definately go with this device, Compaq has thought of everything this time, up to the improved included carrying case (which is an awesome cover pack this time around.)"
4,An excellent Linux PDA,"The iPaq series has been a fine platform for those looking for a nice PDA. The expansion sleeve approach taken by Compaq (now HP) makes it possible to carry the add-ons you want and ignore them when you don't. Techno-types who want more than an overblown PIM with MP3-playback will appreciate the ease with which Linux moves onto the iPaq -- alas, the SD slot can only be operated with slow MMC cards due to nondisclosure licensing terms (security through obscurity rides again...or still). Linux on PDAs is advancing as rapidly as its PC version has done and if you've thought about playing with it, the iPaq's a great machine. (Oh, and you can also restore PocketPC if Linux is not for you.)"
1,Save yourself the trouble!!,"It crashed on me with in 10 minutes of breaking the seal on the package. The ""soft"" reboot did not work. I had to perform a ""hard"" reboot. It worked about 2 more minutes then it crashed again just trying to set the time. The battery showed 98% charged so I unpluged the thing and went mobile. It kept shutting off. When I pluged it back in I could not get a battery reading. I called compaq and before I had a chance to tell them the whole story, the agent said I had a bad battery to send it back. Total time in-hand 20 minutes. Had to pack it up and set it back the day after Christmas. Good luck to all who plunk down 600+ bucks. I hope you have better luck with yours."
2,Over priced software,"software game is over priced. loaded it on Vista laptop..tutorial is not user friendly. have attempted to contact mfg info..phn# disconnected..web site required payment for assistance. husband selected this item. Jewel Case? do they mean the plastic box? After researching further..appears..the Bridge II..compatable with Vista, is only sold in Europe. How can this be?Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Sci-Fi Low Tech oldies,Once upon a time there wasn't much in way of entertainment and B-Movies where needed to fill the theaters needs.Short on budget and long on dreamsthese 10 flicks helped fuel the imagination following the Korean War and the start of the race for space in the late 50's.From Roger Corman's The Last Women On Earth written by Chinatown's Robert Towne to the particularly bad acting in Teenagers from Outer Space creating the movie's unintended hilarity to the all too serious They Came from Beyond Space this collection is mostly a nostalgic look at bad movies with great intentions.Remember the fast forward button.
3,Expensive,Good quality but very expensive for what you get. Your mainly paying for the name. I saw no difference between the Monster cable and ones that cost less than half the money.
2,Disappointed,I've only watched Protocol and was disappointed in the quality. The film was too dark and had several glitches that nearly stopped the movie. My mistake may have been trying for a bargain and getting two movies instead of the one I really wanted.
1,PRIVATE BENJAMIN - WHEN WILL WE SEE IT IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT ?????????,AFTER ALL THESE YEARS SINCE THIS DVD CAME OUT ( ONE OF THE ORIGINAL DVD'S FROM THE 90'S ) WHEN WILL WARNERS FINALLY BREAK DOWN & PUT OUT THE WIDSCREEN VERSION OF THIS GREAT MOVIE ?
3,Double Trouble from Goldie,I didn't realize how much the TV had to edit from Private Benjamin and so was disappointed with the language in the movie... The Library in town got it. Protocol had only a couple of areas that needed cleaning up. Hawn makes simple things look like fun and her dipsy character is so simple and forthright.
5,Incredible progressive metal,"Vivien Lalu is a French artist best known for his work with Joop Wolters and Hubi Meisel (EmOcean). Oniric is a refreshing progressive metal album with great chops, passion and a terrific and complex blend of guitar and keys. Viv has recruited outstanding musicians for this album, including Joop Wolters on guitar, Ryan Van Poederooyen on drums (Devin Towsend Band) on drums, Martin LeMar on vocals and Russell Bergquist (Annihilator) on bass. Every song is excellent. High points are the progressive metal epic ""Potboy: The Final Fantasy"" (18:03), ""Yesterdayman"" (5:35), and ""Night in Poenari"" (5:50). His sound defies pigeonholing, but fans of Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation, Threshold, Sonata Arctica, Ice Age, Shadow Gallery and other great bands on the interface between neo-progressive and prog-metal should give this superb cd a spin.Lalu's home page is here ---> http://www.acl-multimedia.com/~viv/lalu_main.html"
2,Lacks Any True Context,"I picked this up for a few dollars at the bookstore and was invigorated to begin reading it but it turns out that it was written by a dilettante with too much time on his hands. It starts off as a vapid pseudo-bio but the author never real gives us any authentic substance in the 300+ pages. He throws out names as if we are supposed to know defunct abstractions and pretentious writers and he skips the years 1932-1945 for some reason. About half way through the read he really let me down because he goes on to say one of the most incongruous and nonsensical things I have ever heard of, that Franco of Spain ""was not really a fascist"". Obviously the guy has no understanding of precepts relating to Spain or Europe and the ending is a complete waste, considering he devoted one page to Bunuel's death."
3,"Cute, but not ""Faeries.""","This book, while it has its enchanting moments, is not nearly as ""inspired"" and as grand as Froud's ""Faries"" or Poortvliet's ""Gnomes."" For the Froud collector only."
4,easy acces to symbilism,"I realy enjoye this book, it's easy to use and the explanations are clair and simple and include differents aspects and meaning. this book is great to have... tks"
4,I agree.,"This book is full of interesting information on symbolism from throughout history, from many cultures. It has a very extensive dictionary from A to Z of symbolism and cultural icons, with quite a few illustrations. In the back there is also a Pictorial Index of symbols along with page numbers to help make searching for them easier."
2,Not deep enough,"Covers a lot of territory, but nothing meaningful. If you are new to being alive in the west and need to get up to speed on some basic notions of what various symbols mean, this is a useful reference. But if you are looking to get a deep read, this doesn't cut it."
2,2 out of 2 Eye-Q 1300s were defective,"The first one I bought seemed to function OK, except the viewfinder was way off. The captured image could be up, down, left, or right (or any combination thereof). The inaccuracy was so bad and so random as to render the camera useless. I exchanged it. The second one had a more accurate viewfinder. However, it took so long for the flash to charge up, the automatic power-off feature would shut off the camera before the flash was ready. I tried new batteries, but got no improvement. Price, software, cables & accessories, instructions, etc., is all great (hence, the 2 stars). Unfortunately, the camera itself is useless. Two bad examples is hardly a trend. On the other hand, you only get one chance to make a first impression, and I'm done with Concord."
4,"Good face cream, so far","Light cream - almost a lotion that is absorbed immediately. Leaves skin refreshed and dewy. Has a slight hint of natural nutty fragrance that is pleasant. I've only used it for a week and can't comment on its anti-aging effects, but so far, so good. I've been making a real effort to search for natural personal care products and cosmetics, but too often I've been disappointed with their quality and performance. I'm hoping this one will live up to expectations."
2,Not So Good,I didn't notice any improvement in fine lines.I definitelly won't be buying this product again.I guess that's the reason for the product being that affordable.Save your money and buy something that actually works!
5,Fantastic product.,"I admit to being a person that has tried a lot of face lotions in the quest for a product that is both moisturizing and does not stimulate acne on my combination skin. It's a challenge. There are some products that I like just fine, but this moisturizer by Aubrey Organics is one that I LOVE. You can feel the difference as soon as you put it on your finger-- the collagen gives the lotion a spongy feel. It soaks in immediately and my skin feels instantly softer. Also, I am fairly certain that the collagen has minimized the look of crows feet and other fine lines around my eyes and has given my skin more elasticity overall. I am really happy with this product and plan to keep using it indefinitely. Oh and p.s. The fact that it's organic is the icing on the cake (and probably proof that for the best products, we should always look to nature!)"
5,Wonder Cream,"I have to agree with the first reviewer that this cream is amazing in every way in terms of performance, consistency, and purity. The only down side is that the dispenser tends to release more than you really need for just your eyes. However, this was a blessing for me! I found that this cream not only made a difference for my eyes in just ONE use, but by applying it to my wet face and neck after I wash my face, one pump covers it all and I look absolutely radiant. My skin tone and firmness is much improved and still improving after only a couple weeks of use. Thank you so much, Aubrey, for another great product - this one is the best yet!"
2,Not worth it.,"Make sure you realize this is just ONE DVD sermon and then a bunch of extra 1-2 minute clips. I realized that, but still bought it in order to show the 1 sermon, which honestly is not worth $20. The book is very, very good and insightful. The video sermon just does not add all that much. It is just Keller standing in front of a camera paraphrasing the whole book.Again, I would highly recommend the book and bible study. It is fantastic. Don't buy the DVD though."
3,"One Great Session... but not ""Six Sessions.""","The session on this DVD is insightful and powerful. It says on the DVD cover that it contains ""six captivating sessions."" This is a blatant misrepresentation. There is one great session and five two minute clips from that same session. The one session is more than worth it.. but a highly disappointing misrepresentation, if not an outright lie, on the cover of the DVD."
3,"Meh,, could have done better","Wow, this movie started off pretty good, then ended getting worst and worst. I understand that the budget might have been low, but that doesn't excuse bad writing. There are so many problems with the movie, that you just end up not enjoying it much. At the end it started to get good again, but alas, more bad writing. Danny Glover trying to be like Morgan Freeman at the end trying to explain humanity or whatnot was the topping on the cake. They could have done so much better with this movie in my opinion. If you have to think about how dumb something is most of the movie, I don't think the director/writer did their job very well. Still I the premise is pretty interesting on what you would do if you were the only person who could see. Just was expecting more I guess."
1,"Completely idiotic, badly acted, and insipid.","It's hard to bring myself to admit I watched this lame movie, let alone to write about it. It has plot holes so large the word ""holes"" fails to encompass them. It's full of stupid, silly imagery, treacly and nauseating cliches, lousy writing, characters without anything to recommend them (good or bad), and an ending that will make you vomit into your mouth. It makes Benjamin Button seem like art in comparison (and, boy, art it ain't). Everyone involved in this mess should be beaten senseless, metaphorically speaking."
1,AWFUL,"BIG WARNING! There is a very graphic and DISTURBING rape scene in the movie. I strongly suggest that anyone who has had any bad experiences or just has a weak stomach should avoid watching this movie at all costs.This movie sounds like it would be really cool, but the way they carried it out was just terrible. Maybe if it had taken place in a communist country as opposed to the US or another time period as opposed to the present day, it would have been more believable but that's a BIG maybe. Also, don't expect a satisfying solution at the end because they never explain why the people go blind. This movie didn't provoke thought and was violent, disturbing, and unsatisfying. It left me wanting to slit my wrists after I saw it."
1,Dumbest Movie EVER!,"I would rather be beaten with a rubber hose for 2 hours than have to sit through this ridiculous piece of crap of a movie again. NOTHING is explained, why Julianne Moore isnt affected, why the blindess happens, oh and at the end all of a sudden a guy drinks coffee and MAGICALLY he and the rest of the cast see again. STUPID. Do not waste your time, I want those 2 hours of my life back. I cant believe such good actors agreed to participate in this drivel, it made me respect them all a little bit less."
4,Well Done!,"Some of the other ""reviews"" are a bit harsh but that's what happens when viewers miss the point! This movie is one of those gems that explores what could happen when all of your creature comforts are rapidly taken away and decency and manners take a backseat to survival. What do you do? How do you live? Who will lead and who will follow? What kind of governance will prevail - if any? What happens when men are trapped with women? This movie is brutal, unforgiving, unyielding, painfully realistic, and fascinating. As some have said before this movie may not be for everyone but it is worth a look. You may find that this genre is something you like! I know I do. This movie has turned me on to the survival/thriller style of movies and next for me is ""The Road""!"
5,A very cool movie!,This movie is probably one of those love it or hate it type movies. I don't know if I can even explain why I love this movie - I'm just fascinated by it! It haunts me and every time I see it on Cable I watch it. The experience of being blind and quarantined immediately like that and then being ignored by the powers that be is a screwed up reality nowadays. The music is appealing to me too. I could go on and on but I'll spare you!
1,shut up.,"ok, this cd (is awful). i recently downloaded it for a friend and listened to a few tracks. this cd (is awful). they sound just like any other hardcore or ""nu-metal"" band, except with a female vocalist. no variety whatsoever. they even picked the worst song roger waters ever wrote to cover. so take heed from the track listing and run (...)!"
3,"SCREW SLIPKNOT, They are not deathmetal, neither is kittie:)","Way better than the first album. Down tuned guitars, pounding bass, and double bass drums. New Line up Morgan vocals guitar. Talena bass, Mercedes bass, Dave guitar. they've matured a lot music wise, no more sloppy mess of guitar, better vocals, harsher growls, and black metal screams. KiTTiE is a female version of Pantera. The best track on the album is In Winter. The album also contains the one and only single, '' what i always wanted, and Severed, ( featured in Murder by numbers.) Fantastic sophmore album. the rest of the tracks tend to sound the same, but they are still flawless, and have great potential."
2,Too much screaming and growling.,"OK, lets say you have a band with two vocalists, one of them can sing and has a pretty and unique sounding voice. The other just screams incoherantly. Who would you choose to front the band? I would choose the first one. Kittie chose the second at least on this album which was a big mistake, in my opinion. There's really only a couple of good songs, ""In Winter"" is the best and ""What I Alway's Wanted"" is also pretty good but it sounds alot like ""In Winter"". These are the songs the good singer sings on. I think Kittie are talented musicians, very heavy! But I think they'd have some success if they put their good singer up front and saved they screaming, growler for an occasional chorus or something."
5,THis CD RULES,"Hey, All I gotta say is if you like real metal, this CD rocks. (...) This cd is much better than the first, and the drums are much much better than the first. That is probably the best improvement over the old cd. Not much else, but This cd kicks total Arse. They have grown in their musical ability, and even if they did loose a band member, I think it is much better. Go and get it."
3,"Good sound, bad connector","Sound quality is good, but the connector has too tight of a connection. Every time I pull this cable out of the back of my receiver, the plastic connector disconnects from the cable and stays in my receiver. Not worth the money unless you really like the sound of Monster cables and don't plan on disconnecting the cable regularly."
1,Don't buy this book,"My midwife actually recommended this book, but I was very dissapointed with it. I found that the information was dated and some of the thoughts were rediculous. I was raised in a family of ""long haired hippies"" and even I found this book to be way over the top. Carl Jones has obviously never given birth himself but is full of opinions about the pleasurable and borderline orgasmic experience that it can be. Give me a break! Labor is gonna hurt regardless of how many pretty flowers you invision and just because a baby comes out of the same place a woman has intercourse does not mean they are similar experiences for the woman. Take my advise and get Easing Labor Pain by Adrienne Lieberman. It gives great tips on visualization and relaxation techniques for a natural childbirth and she explains the entire birthing process in a realistic way."
2,THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN!,"Come on gals! Stop and think for a moment! the book was written by a man! What does a man know about Labor and Delivery? I read it and it wouldnt have done anything to help me with my labor, believe me! I love how men think its all so easy and can be painless and enjoyable and all this! Puhlease!!! Let a man have a baby and then come talk to me! Mama Harper"
1,Or get the update from Mike himself,"As a sales exceutive who has implemented the Solution Selling tm process in three companies, I can only agree with the previuos reviewer. Skip this rip-off and read Mike Bosworth's REAL sequel, Customer Centric Selling."
5,Great series for international fans,"I randomly came across this series in Amazon and ordered it based on the other reviews. This is the Russian version of Sopranos, 50 minute series about organised crime. Except this series differs as it shows the whole evolution from street gangs to corporate crime and finally into politics. Also, if you are familiar with international cinema, especially Russian, you'll note that these movies are a more accurate portrayal of the good and bad events, without the political correctness and dramatization found in our crime series. Very interesting though, sure to get you addicted after viewing episode 1."
4,Interesting mini series,"The only problem with Brigada for non Russian speakers is the English subtitles. Frequently they make no sense at all.Having said that the series itself is excellent. They perfectly capture the opaque nature of Russian society.Sidorov really succeeds in making you care about and believe in the charactersIf you're tired of glossy Hollywood stuff and want to broaden your horizons, take a look at Brigada"
4,arrow,The product is good that is why I ordered it. When I ordered it said was in stock but after completion of the order told me it was backordered. Not good communications.
5,Very pleased with the material,"Being new to DGIS, I was very pleased to find a ""starters"" book that also has resources for anyone who has 'net-savy'. I found the book to be chucked full of resources, ideas, and steps to implement a DGIS. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in such a dynamic subject."
3,The book that started Kevin out as an author,"Looking back on Kevin's 20 year career as writer, Film-maker and all around expert on Canadian Canoeing/Camping...it's hard to believe that once upon a time, he was just another unknown author trying to make his mark. Well, this book was the one that introduced us to Kevin...Kevin revisited the topic in 2005 and added a section on the French River, making the new book doubly valuable.I like this book, but found the writing a bit rough, as Kevin hadn't found that folksy voice that we got to see in the later books. As well, those lovely maps we see in the later books aren't here: the map are a bit rougher and not so pretty.It's a useful enough guide and certainly a great book to look at if you want to the early stages of Callan's career.Certainly a neat thing would be to read this book and the 2006 redo to compare what a difference 15 years made, both in the park and Kevin's depiction of it."
5,What an annointed voice,"Fred Hammonds sings with such ease. His lyrics are true to the heart. He doesn't just entertain, he hits that heart. Highly recommend his songs. Don't focus on the beats, hear the ear in your HearT and let the words minister to your mind."
2,Plenty of action... lack of substance,"I was very disappointed by this book. I realize it's an action book... but it went a little to far. I mean, yeah, Michael Murphey is pretty amazing but very unrealistic. He's too good to be true- which is perhaps the authors intent- but he's stretched it to the max.Although there is plenty of adventure in this book, I get the feeling Tim LaHaye is simply writing marketing more books. The ending was completely awful- a total cliff hanger and major marketing scam so you HAVE to buy the next book to even know if SOMEONE lives! Crazy. Ridiculous. I have a feeling this is going to turn into the next ""Left Behind"" series with 10+ books and loot galore. I'm not buying it."
2,Europa Preach-To-Me,"Though I am not done, I am already bored and annoyed to death. I anxiously bought this book, hoping it would be okay. Every other line contains some sort of preaching from LaHaye and he puts in stereotypes about terrorists. What is he thinking. Preaching on every page...I know LaHaye's a Christian preacher, but this is taking it to the extreme. While trying to ignore the preaching, the plot is putting me to sleep. I would read some of Douglas Preston's and Lincoln Child's books instead. Try Brimstone, Dance of Death, and Relic and Reliquary. Those are real authors."
4,Darryl's Review,"Another fine book in a good series. Quick read, good historical accuracy. Good plot and characters."
4,Nearly perfect...,"I recieved the 3765 for Christmas, and for the most part, since I was expecting a Handspring Visor Prism instead, (suprise!) this is an awesome little gadget. My major complaint is that the input methods are annoying and I usually revert to the little keyboard at the bottom of the screen. Speaking of which, the screen gets scratched VERY easily- would recommend screen protectors, except that nobody seems to like those. I like the design, and it goes nicely with the updated Pocket PC 2002- the MS Windows feel is very easy to get used to. Display is crisp, memory is plentiful, and the sound quality is sweet, considering how small the speaker is- the voice recording is also a major plus. All in all, if it wasn't for the flimsy screen and the high price, I'd give this 5 stars."
2,"Hardware is Fair, Software is Riddled with Bugs","I am not a computer guru, I admit. But I do have a decent grip on modern technology. I purchased this IPAQ in the hopes that it could replace my paper calendar and my appointment book at home, while also allowing me to type term papers on it at school and keep good notes. But instead, all it does is keep track of my appointments at work. It freezes up often while using it and the battery lasts only a couple of hours on low power. It's absolutely rediculous. When you add in all the software bugs, like not being able to easily synchronize with more than one computer, and the machine becomes a time and money waste.This is not a handheld computer at all. I should have waited for better technology."
2,Would not turn on,"I recieved a defective Ipaq 3765 and was thouroughly disappointed. The switch in the on/off box was not there so I could not even turn it on. Looked nice but may have to go backto franklin planner. I agree with earlier reviews, It is a fragile thing and wondered aloud as to why there was no protective cover??"
4,iPaq 3765 Is it 1 of the top PDA's?,"First let me say I am not a ""techie"" but I can follow directions fairly well. Instructions come in a small book and are very basic, but allow you to get the set up completed with little problems, anything more than that and you will have to call Compaq Tech Support, which is an act in futility.After owning a Handspring Visor Prism, and an HP Jornada 568, the Compaq 3765 would have to rate #2 out of the 3. The metal case on the 3765 is very appealing until you pick it up and realize how smooth it is, so make sure you hold on. I had to reinstall the active sync numerous times as it would not recognize my USB connection?Color is excellent on the 3765, and once I got everything going it worked great, and I had no problem loading in my contact list from my cardscan files.I rate the 3765 a 4 because I had no problems with the Visor Prism, or the HP Jornada, and they worked first time out of the box, and both provided much better Customer Service and support."
2,picture is the best it will ever look,i got this a while back. first thing i noticed was that it was a lot bigger than it looked in the pictures. my second complaint is that its shiny finish makes it look cheap (i guess you get what you pay for) and scratches are far more visible because of the almost mirror like finish. my final complaint would be its strap which wont go to my wrist size quite right but i guess that depends on the person. but it does read time well and it is easily visible. however waste your 40 dollars elsewhere
5,"Pirates of Integrity, albeit Nazi influenced","An intriguing and informative account of (at least for me) a beforehand unknown type of naval warrior. Capt. Slavick portrays the intregrity, honor and sterling seamanship of the German sailors in a well paced account of their arduous and eventful journey. The book is effuse with personal anecdotes of the crew and Slavick does an especially good job of portaying the exceptional character and ability of Kapitan-zur-See Bernard Rogge. This account compares with ""South"" by Shakleton in intrigue but is a more juicy and livlier book."
3,More details please,"Slavick's work is a welcome addition to the works on the exploits of the German merchant raiders and the detailed source references are a bonus. However, a detailed map of the raider's cruise, a chronology of the raider's victims, and more photos and more biography on what Rogge is required. What made him tick? How did such an honourable man (was his first wife Jewish?) serve the Third Reich? Until these omissions are rectified, the books by Rogge and Mohir & Selwood, remain the best sources."
4,A,"book got to me. it was as said. a few folded pages but it was a used textbook so i figured as much. good job, thanks"
4,fine novel about an isolated southern family,Delta Wedding is one of only five novels that Eudora Welty wrote and may be her best.This novel about an isolated slightly aristocratic southern family is full of interesting characterization and dry humor.We really feel like we know the Fairchilds after completing the book. The perspective of the young cousinLaura who comes fromJackson to the wedding is important and it gives depth. At times the book rambles and there are dead spots but overall a good piece of literature
1,Agree with other One Star Posters,"After being frustrated trying to get into this book, I read all the reviews. I should have done that first and saved time. I picked this book off a library shelf because I had read some of Eudora Welty's short stories.Now I won't feel guilty in NOT finishing the book.I won't repeat what the other one star posters said. They hit the nail on the head."
1,Wrong Item in Box,"Gee, I can't write a real review because it is taking so ridiculously long to get a replacement, when a straight stand showed up in the boom stand box. We did our part and sent it back immediately. There is NO excuse for this taking so long, and I can find no other way to complain about this except to write a bad review. I have no way of knowing where the bottle neck is, but something needs to be done about it."
4,good for the money,"Great stands for me and my son. Set up was a snap and we were playing in mins. Can not extend boom Arm all the way out or it will tip over, other than that I love them."
5,A wonderful work,"Barlowe outdoes himself with this book. A gorgeous treatment of a fictional journey to another world. The paintings are all incredibly breathtaking, and the science and logic behind them is impeccable. A must buy."
3,First gundam ever,"Got this in Hong Kong, when I was a small.I didn't know what the hell to pick, so I got this one.The first time being exposed to these things you are like wow.But it turns out I really wanted the Zeta, because it can transform.This slowly becomes boring. It is just a model after all.I resold it years later. I got tired of it. It's adequate and doesn't fall apart."
5,Great way to build self-esteem in children,"This is a great book with lots of fun games that will help build self-esteem in children. No competition, just fun. Parents who want to help their children with self-esteem will find lots of help in this book!"
2,Helpful,"This book may be more helpful for the person who is a borderline candidate for kidney disease in instructing them in ways to better care for themselves,what to avoid and what to look for in regards to progression of the disease."
4,"Good, written in 2004","I think this book gives very good explanations for a very complex problem. I must remark on it's age tho. It was written almost ten years ago (2013 now) and lots of medical research has taken place time. In my opinion it is worth a read and then asking your medic about certain aspects...like your blood work values. I have had CKD all my long life and I would never counsel anyone to self treat this disease, but understand it certainly."
4,coping with kidney disease,This book is full of technical information and might be difficult for anyone without a medical background to understand. That being said it is very helpful and gives the unvarnished information about having kidney disease and how to possibly avoid dialysis. Time will tell if it is correct or not. I thought it very useful and educational.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I ORDERED THIS FOR A SURPRISE 40TH PARTY AND WHEN OPENING IT FOUND A HOLE THE SIZE OF A NICKLE, EVEN WITH EXTENSIVE MENDING WOULD NOT HOLD AIR...WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY....IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BIG SURPRISE DECORATION..WHAT A LET DOWN. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!"
4,GREAT product!,"nice durability, good price and prompt shipping... all things that are most important to me in online buying! We used this as a prop for Jesus' birthday 2011!"
1,trash,"I bought these two touch and feel books and it cost 4.75 , no big deal, great price. when i got the items they were so filthy i wouldnt let anyones child touch them. I live in AK so it would cost me more than 4.75 to ship back. I contacted the company and they wouldnt help but only to refer me to amazon because they are the ones who shipped it. Like i said I didnt return because of cost but that is horrible even who ever shipped them should know not to send items that still have food and massive amount of dirt on books little babies/kids are going to handle, HORRIBLE. Glad it was only 4.75 I was out of but I trashed them!"
2,"Slow, Too Many Character Names","While the transaction was fine, the book did not work for me. Lots of character names, nothing engaging."
5,good book,this was an excellent book that portreyed the life and rich history of the vietnamese woman.
4,Interesting view of Vietnam,Anyone interested in Vietnamese history and culture outside of the Vietnam War will find this book very interesting and thought provoking.Though written by a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party and someone who fought for the communists the book is very anti-communist party and its leadership. The book gives a devestating look at the land reform campaign of the 1950's.The bottom line is the book is well translated and easy to read. And it gives us a look at Vietnam most of us have never seen before. It is a good read and makes you think!
4,loved it,The dress size was a little big for my normall sizes and as expected the corset was really tight. if the dress size was right it would have been better but over all i loved it
4,Trac Duy from Viet Nam,"I have a hard time making it through this book simply because I am rereading pages multiple times . As we known , security field will soon become the hostest problem in our world . I had read a lot of book in this field and that's my favorite time .Constructing a Secure Enterprise Network--Remote Securityby Faulkner is the best one I ever read .Read this book from a close friend , I nearly can't leave my eyes from this book because the author has a wonder way to express things at first look very difficult , i think may be from his experience in his job . I'll find more his book because I learn a lot of thing from hom .If I could pick one book to read in my favorite time this would be it."
1,One of the worst programming language books I have read.,"Althougth the writing style was not terrible (for a book on a programming language), the utiliity of this book is near zero. There are no complete example programs in the book. In order to understand how different parts in an Ada program interact it would be helpful if complete programs were included. This book was assigned reading for a programming language course."
3,Just OS of WS not the holy grail of web services,"It basically provides a synopsis of various web server O/S capabilities. But it does not account for the fact that ""managed services"" offered by various web hosting companies is what really determines the capabilities of the web head. However, if all you need to know is which O/S to use for your W/S platform, this book is for you. However, your application may be a big factor in determining the O/S for you W/S"
5,An Absolute Classic of Fluid Mechanics,"Anyone studying fluid mechanics should have a look at this book of visualized experimental results. The photography is excellent, the reproduction quality is superb and the explanations in the text are clear and thought-provoking. When taking your first courses in fluid mechanics, it is very worth having Van Dyke's Album of Fluid Motion around, to jog your intuition, motivate your studies and -- most importantly -- keep alive your sense of wonder."
5,Continuing on a great theme...,"Like Homeland before it, Exile continues with the adventures of the drow elf, Drizzt Do'Urden. Drizzt has left his 'home' of Menzoberranzan, and has decided to live out his days in the endless caverns and tunnels of the wild underdark.Accompanied only by his magical panther companion, Drizzt takes on a fighting edge that is unsurpassed by any other. But with this edge comes a price - Loneliness. Drizzt finds it difficult to come to terms with his new existance, and seeeks out companionship.Drizzt finds acceptance with the most unlikely of people, but as seems to be the case with the beleagured drow, all must change and he must move on."
4,Drizzt Book two,"This was not a good as the first one, but this is still an excellent read - Salvatore makes characters that should be forgotten about, but he finds a way to makes you want to read about the Dark Elf Drizzt, and the companions who would normally be killed and forgotten, are also interesting and have personalities that make me want them to survive with Drizzt in his quest for his new life away from the Drow - wonderful job of storytelling, and wonderful moments of tension and action mixed with the internal quest of finding where he belongs in the world."
5,This book is Cool!,"I bought this book in about July of '97. I read the beginning and wasn't very interested. Soon, I lost the book. Yesterday, in the process of cleaning my room, I found it again. I picked it up and started reading. Now, only about 24 hrs later, I am finished. This book is fantastic and the story really hooked me. I love to read about the drow homeland and how the women rule the men! You must get this book, order it NOW!!!"
5,Exile this is my second time through this series and it still keeps the reader in awe,Love this author I have started to read this series again to see what I missed the first time. I would recommend this author to anyone who likes fantasy and or dark elves.
3,worked only in conjunction w/ magnesium,i was taking up to 6 a day & it wasn't working. my issues are due to medication. i found that once i added a magnesium supplement w/ it that the results were much better & i only take 2 a day now.
1,No change,These pills made no difference whatsoever. I even had my mom try them and she said the same thing! I don't know why they didn't do anything.
1,Beware Tyler fans: Food 911 or How To Boil Water this is not,"After reading these reviews and seeing that the title was ""Real Kitchen"" I assumed that this book would be more like Tyler's shows and full of his easy style of just whipping stuff up. However, the book is full of highfalutin recipes and hard-to-find ingredients. I have never cooked with fresh figs and don't plan to any time soon.I wanted something that is more easy going, like Tyler seems to be. This book is fru-fru and fussy as far as I'm concerned.If you want a more practical book, look elsewhere. Sorry Tyler! Maybe your next cookbook with suit me better. I will still watch him on TV and perhaps download recipes that I think I will like from the Food Network website instead."
1,Disappointment,"Enjoy Tyler Florence's FoodTV shows. This book was a big disappointment, didn't contain recipes that are so enjoyable on his shows. Too much seafood and pork. Flipped through and resold on ebay the next day. Skip this one."
3,know how to cook first,"Echoing many of the sentiments already stated, I would say that it is almost a must that you have some experience in the kitchen before trying most of these recipes. Some of them are indeed wondeful and tasty, but Tyler's very informal way of communicating (""counts"" of oil, no exact times for some preparations: ""until it's perfumy"") may leave your recipe ruined. For instance, if you don't know before hand that cooking crab cakes in a non-stick skillet (Tyler doesn't specify, he just says ""skillet"") is an absolute must, your $30 worth of lump crabmeat might just go into the garbage. Given that Tyler is a ""celebrity"" chef, and purchasers of this book will probably consist of a certain number of novice chefs, the shorthand communication style of the book is a massive oversight."
4,Monster Audio Cable,"Decent cable, works well. It is 16 ft long NOT 18 as some tech specs mis-inform."
1,Disappointing,I thought this was a great little stepper for about 2 months and then it began to make a little snapping sound. Tonight it made a big snapping sound and crashed. It lasted a total of about 3 months which makes it not worth the money.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this stepper for my small home gym I am in the process of putting together; I have no problem with the stepper, but it comes with a VCR tape not a DVD. Like most people, I no longer own a VCR player. I contacted the maker of the stepper via e-mail, (after going through many channels to get the address); they where friendly and helpful, but no dvd at this time. So, you may want to wait until a dvd is available before purchasing this item."
3,"Nothing magical here,",We have this for 5 years. I dont think this device is anything magical. It is just the temperature method and nothing more nothing less. I am saying this if you miss a date the device start panicing. It will put more yellow days all along. this is a lame device.
1,A Massive Mediocrity,"Cindra Wilson hates Celine Dion and the New Kids on the Block. Gee, she sure has carved out a unique niche. Her utterly mundane worldview would be at least mildly entertaining if she could write. But here's a typical passage:""As you can see, the deep, widespread, and dangerous hysteria a seemingly inconsequential boy band can spread is absolutely staggering, and all the more depressing since the driving push behind the whole teen music deal is groteque wealth.""Driving push? Teen music deal? This isn't an isolated example. This is how she writes. Some reviewers have compared her to Dorothy Parker. As a writer, she more closely resembles Parker Stevenson. Or as Wilson herself might put it: the writing stuff in this book like thing kind of [is not good]."
3,just so so,Not sth i expect... And i don't think it's bright enough for reading... So save your money if you want a bright light to read in the dark
3,NOT very good for reading,"This little lamp is OK for what it is, but I have to disagree with other reviewers who think it is a perfect lamp for reading. The lamp does not have much power. I wanted to clip this lamp to the headboard of my bed and use it for reading before going to sleep, but it is impossible unless you clip the lamp to the book itself. This can cause some damage to the book, pressure marks and the like.Unless this lamp is just a few inches from the page, it's just not bright enough to read. Unless you want to ruin your eyes. I bought this lamp believing the great reviews about reading, but I am really pretty disappointed."
1,Junk,This is plain junk. The light is so weak (with new batteries) thatI would do better with a candle
5,Just what I needed!,"Hey, this thing works great with either your Kindle or a regular book. I looked at a lot of clip on lights before deciding on this one according to what others wrote about it. They didn't lead me wrong! Excellent little light!"
3,Nice light; not good with the Kindle,"The brightness, flexibility, light weight, and style of this product are excellent. However, do NOT purchase for use with your Kindle. The clip is too large and interferes with the top few lines on the screen. There are no alternative places to clip it onto the Kindle without interfering with the navigation tools or screen. Bummer."
4,"A bit of overkill-reading a book, not performing neurosurgery","The good1. Lightweight even with the batteries in.2. Super flexible neck-positions smoothly and stays in position3. Bright light-reeeaaallly brightThe slightly annoying1. The light is so bright and disperses in such a wide cone it's annoying to a partner sharing a bed or a fellow passenger on a plane seated next to you.2. Not dinging the rating for this, but no doubt there will be people like me who purchased this for some kindle reading. It works beautifully with the e-ink but is (obviously) not compatible with the slots that come in some cases. Which is fine. It just clips to the cover instead.3. It's obvious from the picture, but this light is obviously not great for travel. It doesn't fold into anything more compact.It's still a great product for a fantastic, unbeatable price, but wow there is such a thing as too bright. Happy reading!"
2,Started off good...,"When I first received this light I really liked it. It lit up both pages of a decently sized book very well and I could read fine with it. After just a few months of use, the light flickers in and out. It's a huge pain to read with and the only way to get the light to come back on his to tap it. I wouldn't recommend this item."
5,Perfect design and good quality,"Got these for my kids for Christmas and they use them nightly. They've taken them camping, packed them in suitcases, and of course, leave them laying on the floor and stuffed under pillows and such, and they still hold their shape when bent for reading and other tasks. The lights are bright and the batteries from Christmas are still going strong!"
4,Decent light but goes dim after extended use,"I bought this light because my three-year-old son started turning on his bedroom light each night after going to bed to look at books. He then falls asleep with the bedroom light on and we have to turn it off when either my husband or I go to bed. Since we are having a baby that will share my son's room in the next few months we decided to get a small booklight we could hook onto his bed to read with. I liked that it was an LED bulb since it was likely he would forget to turn it off and I didn't want to constantly replace the batteries. With this light, it worked great for about a week and then with the constant use (he would turn it on even in the daytime and it would get left on round the clock) it eventually went to a ""dim"" setting and was not nearly as bright as before. Overall, the quality of the light has been good. It has even stood up to a toddler handling it all the time."
3,its a light,"a cheap little light, with pretty good output. works well if the girlfriend has managed to put down the kindle, and is reading an actual book. short money, does what you need it to do. nothing fancy."
4,Very bright light but limited to small books.,"The led is very bright and more than enough to read small books. But if you are planning to use for a laptop etc, this might not be the one for you. If you are using a decent sized book, its very difficult to get the light away from your sight and be able to read the book properly. This is because the flexible stem is very short. I mean its like just 10 inches or probably less!"
1,Broke within a month,"The light worked fine for about a month. It is similar to the Mighty Bright lights. I didn't think it worked any better than the Mighty Bright lights we own, but it seemed to be fine. However, soon the on/off button broke off and it cannot be used at all. We were disappointed with the low quality."
1,Cheap Crap From China,"I was so impressed by the other reviews that I bought two. Yes, the LED is bright and has a nice spectrum, but after only a couple hours of use, it started flickering and won't stay on. The switch is completely flaky, and has lots of wiggle. Even the slightest movement causes it flicker, and I have to adjust it continuously to get it to work. Sometimes it comes on really bright and nice, but usually it's dimmer (when it's not flickering). And BOTH of them are like this. The spring in the clip is weak, and the body is made of a cheap, brittle plastic. It's unfortunate that there are few other choices available. I'm going to spend the $24 to get one from Levenger and hope for the best. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Flickering light is unacceptable,"I received this light as a gift for Christmas. At first I thought it was a great present to go with my Kindle. However, the light seems to flicker anytime I move the head and I have to tap it in order for it to stay on. I've swapped out batteries and still had no luck. What a piece of junk."
5,Excellent Value,"I have purchased two of these lights. One I use for book-reading, working with small tools/crafts, etc. at home.The second, I clipped to my bicycle handlebars and use it with Amazon's VDO X1 Bicycle Computer. I ride at night and this is absolutely perfect to illuminate the computer in the dark.The batteries last a very long time and the neck is extremely flexible but sturdy (doesn't wobble on the bike). The light is very bright for such a tiny light. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Useful,"Fulcrum Multi-Flex LED Task Light, Silverlight weight, easy to use, can be cliped to the top of a laptop"
3,"The ""Flex"" is the best part","PROS: the long, flexible neck allows for tilting in almost any direction, the clip is large enough to clip to lots of pages in a book, the clip doubles as a stand so the light can sit flat on a table, the light is LED (long-life), it's small enough to carry for travel and because the neck is so flexible, it's easy to bunch up even smaller for travelCONS: the light isn't always bright enough (when reading in dark); I find myself adjusting the light often to get the whole page of the book visible, the on/off switch takes some pressure to switch on or off, and because the clip is larger, I adjust it often to clip more book pages in so they're not folding over such a bulky clip while reading"
2,Not good for much IMO,"I have purchased a few LED lights now. None of them do the job I bought them for. They are not bright enough and the lighting area they throw is too small, not enough to sufficiently cover a computer keyboard or full size book."
2,Failed after two months.,"We rent our place and so we need simple solutions for things. I purchased two of these lights. One to light the backporch stairwell for when we take out the garbage and the second one as a bedroom reading light. The one on the back porch is still fine. It's only used a few times a week and only for a few minutes at a time. The one I used daily was great for the first month and then it progressively started becoming dimmer. It'd then fluctuate between being really dim and working properly. I'm not sure if it couldn't stand up to daily use or if I just got a dud. I ended up buying the Mighty Light next, which ended up working much better. The light has high/medium settings and there's been no flickering or dimming of the light."
4,It beats cursing the darkness,"The light is a nice broad focus, not reeal bright hot spot and darkness for the rest of the page. with the 3 AAA batteries, th unit is a bit heavier than some, but not bad enough to be a problem for me. As bis at the base of the lamp is, it allows it to be used as a small desk lamp as well. I am not sure how the batter life is, as I have not used up the first set."
4,"Has held up, but touchy when the battery is low","My 10 year old has used this every night for a few years, and it's held up well. The light does start to blink out when moved, but only when the batteries start to go low. For the price, I'd buy it again."
1,"Horrible book ""light""","I actually bought TWO of these, thinking maybe the first one was just a dud. This is a great book light for about one or two days. Then it just gets dim. If you hold the switch back and press it down at the same time, or bang it against the wall it will brighten up, but once you bend it back over and go back to trying to read, it dims to the point of being useless."
3,Teensy,"Smaller than I expected, but it works, and shines pretty bright. It makes reading in bed a lot more productive."
4,Very portable work/reading light,"It's good for working on sewing machines and reading specs at the same time. At times it is hard to find a good spot to clamp the light on. But, all in all, it is very usefull."
3,works well,"I prefer to read with a Kindle Fire, which has a back light. However, when reading a book I find I need extra light and this works well when I am reading in bed at night."
5,"Efficient, Looks Great","Most of what can be said about this toilet has been said by others. It is well constructed, functions perfectly and has a very clean, low-profile look. It uses about as little water per flush as I imagine any toilet could. I purchased it so that I could use a bidet toilet seat on it and it fits very well. My only slight regret is that Toto does not have many colors available. In this regard, Kohler is the king of the hill. It doesn't match my grey fixtures but, then again, the bidet seats are available in versions of white just like the toilet. Good purchase. Truck delivery was quite slow--about two weeks from order to delivery but it arrived intact."
2,"Tip Broken, Terrible Burn as Result","I was soldering when the hot tip broke off (near base) and stuck in my arm while it was on 3/4 power. I followed all the instructions to the letter, and did not have the item for very long. I guess the broken-off tip melted my flesh, because it stuck in my arm. It was too hot to pull out with my bare hands. Anyway, now I have what may or may not be a third degree burn and permanent scar on my right forearm."
1,Would not ignite...,"There were a few other reviews that said it would not ignite. I had hoped that this was a problem with only a few of these soldering irons. I got mine and had the same problem.I had to know what the problem was so I got out my Dremel and some other various materials with which I modified the tip and it ignited fine. The soldering iron part no longer fits on the modified tip, so now I have a a lighter... a very expensive lighter.To sum it all up, this soldering iron has a faulty tip which, in this case, rendered it useless for its intended purpose."
4,The Jonah Man,"This is an excellent book, little-known, which should have a resurgence now that a nonfiction treatment of the same events, Heart of the Sea, is a bestseller. Told as a reminiscence from the point of view of Captain Pollard, The Jonah Man is primarily a character study, but doesn't lack for gripping action. The slightly distanced tone doesn't describe the horrors of months in an open boat graphically, but the mood comes across effectively nonetheless. After surviving shipwreck and near starvation, Pollard's real ordeal comes when he must face his fellow Nantucketers. Though I was a little confused as to the exact nature of the epiphany he experiences in the end, I found the book to be an interesting study of individualism, guilt and redemption. Here and there character dialogue and thoughts seemed a little too psychoanalytic to be period, but it was a minor flaw."
1,Very poor cuisinart muffin top pan,I have purchased 6 of the Cuisinart muffin top pans. They are advertised as non-stick. After about 5 uses they STICK. Even after I carefully oil each cup and brush the oil for complete coverage the muffin tops not just stick but pull a fair amount of muffin from the botton of the muffin.I strongly suggest the people should not buy this pan but Amazon should not carry it. It is a misrepresentation when they claim it is non-stick.Thanks.
5,MUFFIN TOPS TOP FULL MUFFINS ON THE CHART,"For people who like to experience the crunch, nothing beats baking muffin mix in a muffin-top pan. I would compare it with liking the crust of bread and not so much the inside. The muffin tops freeze well and defrost quickly. Muffin-top pans make it happen."
2,not worth $12.99,"I was looking forward to this mat because it was just the size I needed and the material was going to be easier to clean than the old fashion bamboo type. However, it took only until the third use for the binding to separate from one whole side. There was no weather condition or style of use that could have caused this (I used it on grass in a quiet, ordinary park), only workmanship defects. The binding is not compatible with the mat itself and now I expect fraying and further separation. I am disappointed, the look is good but the quality is poor.Don't make the same mistake as me: I don't get to spend much time in the park and my infrequent usage made me miss the deadline to return it."
2,not great quality..doesn't look new,"Ordered this book ""new"" and it came looking pretty beat up, wear marks all around the edges, the back has indentations/scratches all over it and there is black marker on the bottom of the book. I expected it to look new like the others I ordered (not from this vendor). Also, the book advertised in the ""look inside"" feature has a ""snore"" button for when the bear snores and the book I received does not which is disappointing because I know my kids would have enjoyed that. Overall I am very disappointed with this purchase and the book may be going back because of it."
5,"Bear Snores, Kids love it!","This picture book is a great gift to or from cabin lovers and campers. Looks good on the coffee table, too! Great rhymes and illustrations.Dale Ogren"
2,Not good at all,I used this sharpener for a year already and was not satisfied at all. Recently I bought Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener which is 3 times cheaper as well as 3 times better.
1,This book was agonizing to read,"Who is giving this book 4 1/2 stars? This book was PAINFUL! First of all, it is WAY too long for the amount (or lack) of a storyline it contains. Also, maybe all of the people reviewing it are relatives of priests or something, but I COULD NOT COMPREHEND the weird father-daughter relationship. The daughter seemed to be schizophrenic - especially with her strange romantic ""relationships."" This is the last Gail Godwin book I will read. She has lost her chance. If I didn't have to finish this for my book club, it would've been collecting dust on my bookshelf."
2,Actually took this Camping last week,"I ordered two different types of fry pans and took them camping last week. This one was very dissapointing , as the eggs I cooked in it stuck all over the pan. I loved the way the handle folded up, but the pan had to be soaked to get the eggs off."
4,Excellent product,"Best buy for the price, I have 2 now. You can pay $100.00 more to get a second honing wheel that is not necessary. The older unit is now 5+ yrs old and has been flawless.Chef's Choice 300 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener, White"
3,works but not as expected,"It is my first sharpener. as other reviewers pointed, it works for soft knives but not hard knives."
3,need practise,Be prepared to practice. Might be a great tool but for now it is a source of frustrationNot impressed so far but most tools require practise
1,lousy,I've had this product for years hoping to make it work. Never could but didnt want to give up on it. Now that I have the time still cant get it to sharpen anything. Absolute trash and a waste of money.
3,Adequate sharpener,"This sharpener does the job, but the adage, ""you get what you pay for"", comes to mind. I would have liked to purchase the top of the line model, but that cost several times more than this unit, and was simply not in my budget. But, in the end, this unit does a better job than any manual sharpener I have tried. It does the ripe tomato test, wherein a sharpened knife can produce slices paper thin. I would recommend this product for those who want an entry level unit."
1,Disappointed,"I read and followed the directions very carefully and still the knife was not sharp. After a year of trying to cope with this item and ""master it"" . . . still the same results. Almost ruined my good knifes.Had to bring my knifes to a professional to get the cutting edge back to the correct angles. Now I could use a hand sharpner, like the butchers and chefs use.I bought a hand diamond sharpener and it works very well for only $20 and takes up very little space. Quick and easy! I suggest you pass on this vibration sharpner item, or the more expensive versions of it. Instead, purchase a hand ""steel"" sharpner or a diamond one."
2,Don't waste your money,"Get the Presto Pro instead of this junk. I had to throw this one away because one of the wheels stopped working. It never impressed me when it worked. I got the Presto Pro and was blown away at how much better it was than the Chef's Choice, and it was almost half the price. Go with the Presto Pro...you will be happy you did."
4,Smart Buy!,"I don't normally write reviews, but this time I will as I think it might help others who have been searching for a decent and reasonably-priced sharpener. Four months ago I had about 14 utility and steak knives sharpened by an upscale store in Santa Monica. The price? $35.00. Now, I got the 300W for $34.88 all in. I sharpened the knives according to the instructions, and they came out sharper than the ""professional"" store job!"
2,Slow and wears out fast,"The concept is appealing: a small electric sharpener with magnetic sides that help guide the knife. The problem is that it is slow going when you first get it and it doesn't work at all after a year or so. I guess the stones wear out or something. Anyway, mine is totally worn out and I am looking for another solution."
1,Not my best purchase ever,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago and I haven't been able to get my knives properly sharp from using it, no matter how long I have spent carefully following the instructions. My partner couldn't believe it wouldn't work and, thinking I might be too easily put off, tried it too, using as many alternative artful variations in technique as he could think of. It didn't work for him either. I ended up throwing it out.Now I use a simple sharpening stone, which is far more effective and environmentally friendly. Better for your arm muscles too."
4,"Chef's Choice 300 Diamond Hone Knife Sharpener, White",The knives that I had were very dull and unsafe to use. After a short use of the sharpener they were like brand new.
5,"New Majic sampler, Vol. 3","Excellent selection of New Age Jazz from the 1990s.

1,coffee maker no good,"I purchased this coffee maker about 2-3 months ago. It stopped working yesterday morning so I took it back to where I purchased it and brought home a new one exactly like it. I ran it through it's first cycle and it did fine. This morning I'm really disappointed because it would not work at all, the clocked was the only thing that worked and I wanted a coffee maker with a timer so It would be ready when I get up in the morning..So you can see I am very disappointed with this product. Next time I am definitely changing brands.No coffee in the morning means a bad day for me...."
2,Extremely UK focussed,"Sadly I am unimpressed by this book.I am looking for a book that describes the different cuts of meat and also give information about variations between countries (grain/grass feed, hanging, marbling). A book with the general title ""Meat"" should be a bit more general that this book. The author takes a strong UK perspective. So for instance we don't learn anything about different butchering methods in different countries. Instead we gets lots of information about UK organic agriculture that the author likes. Still, we don't get much understanding about how organic is related to taste.We also only get information about the major cuts. The speciality cuts (and the chef's favorite cuts like cheeks) we don't learn anything about. The book also contains a section with the different cooking techniques illustrated with a number of recipes.After having looked at many books I don't think the book that I would like have been published yet."
3,Famous meat book,Disappointing book but depends what u r looking for. Lots of theory around meat it's excellent. For meat dishes it's bad.
1,Made it worse,"I followed the instructions to repair a small rip in my new vinyl tablecloth. Unfortunately though it sealed the rip, it caused the vinyl to thin in a large spot around the rip, also causing discoloration, so now the defect is more noticeable than ever! It's almost like it ate through the vinyl, making what was once thick vinyl very thin in that spot. Ugh. Now I will have to throw out my tablecloth."
