4,Just too cute,"Don't know how it tastes good I hope, it was a gift. Bought it because there are so many but this one caught my eye because of the packaging both of container and the tea itself. Came quickly."
1,This title is not available for customers from: Australia,"Unfortunately, i can not give a real review because i can not buy this book. Amazon has allowed me to buy and spend weeks reading this series , however now that i need book 4 of the series i can not purchase it on kindle because im from Australia.I also can not contact any one from amazon for an explanation.I was even able to purchase book5 witch i suppose is now a waste of money.Maybe Australians should consider buying any of the series through Kindle store...."
2,ehhhh,"Well ... this is the second movie that Steve Beck has made for Dark Castle Pictures, the first being the god-awful 13 Ghosts remake, and I have to say he's getting better. You CAN actually see him progressing as a director.Don't get me wrong it's still not a very good movie, but it's not like there isn't improvement. Beck is working with a much better cast this time out, the story isn't quite as ridiculous as '13 Ghosts' was, and Beck does a credible job generating some spooky moments and tension.""Not Terrible"" is probably the best stamp I could put on it. I'm not sure I could recommend buying a copy, but you could probably rent it without feeling ripped-off."
2,don't watch with great expectations,"I'll give ya the good and the bad as quickly as I can.The good; Acting. Everyone was pretty on their game in this film. The visuals were pretty good too, they kept the movie creepy in a classic way.The bad; the plot. Maybe I've seen too many ghost stories but how many times can we learn the lesson, gold leads to dead cursed stuff. The movie was well written for what it was but it wasn't much. Cheap scares all done before with little variation. Personally it's a film I'm not likely to remember in 6 months unless I see the cover again."
2,Not the best script in the horror files,"After all the hype, this movie failed to live up to the scary expectations that were promised.Although the acting was passable, the sets were remarkable, the lighting was effective, there was still a lot to be desired with this film.The real highlight of the DVD came from all the extra's where we were given an inside look at the creation of the special effects as well as the film development.It doesn't have a decent shelf life that would command repeat viewings. Personally, this is one to rent before you buy it."
1,JUNK Ship,"Ghost Ship is one of the worst kinds of Hollywood [double dealing] to come along in some time. No wonder THE RING blew it out of the water during it's theatrical release. After a very cool opening, the movie falls into some of the worst dialogue, even worse acting and a completely predictable yawn fest. Not one single scare. No consistency of performance from moment to moment. I've seen these actors in other films or on TV and I suspect they can actually act, but wow, [are they bad] in this. Only young Emily Browning as Katie gives a strange intriguing performance. The film should've been about her not a sorry [imitation]of ALIEN dynamics. And while this movie's gorgeously photographed, and lushly production designed, it's not enough to make it worth the torturous 91 minutes of viewing. Badly executed with a cheeseball score - Ghost Ship should be sunk and forgotten. AVOID!!"
2,terrible,THIS MOVIE TRIED TO BE SCARY BUT IT WASNT. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT TWO STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE BEGINNING WHEN EVERYONE IS CHOPPED UP. OVERALL THE MOVIE IS LOUSY AND DULL.
2,"Rather bland, standard ghost story.","I watched Ghost Ship and Resident Evil within a day of each other and the difference was quite startling. Where Resident Evil was a rollercoaster of pacing and noise with a great back story, Ghost Ship lumbers along without much direction. Salvaging a luxury liner whose passengers were mysteriously `dispatched' in the 60's, a glorified tug boat captained by a tired and haggard looking Gabriel Byrne must try to understand why his crew is suddenly disappearing. This film just didn't really engage me. The chick from ER as a spot welding heroine? Not only do I not find her attractive anyhow, but that just didn't cut it in the story itself. The tug crew running around in the old rusted and rotted carcass of the ship reminded me and made me pine for a DVD version of Attack of the Mushroom People. Now there was a ghost ship story worth something."
2,a stinker,"This thing could have been awsome,but it bites the big one instead.All those people who were killed on the ship and all we get are a handfull of spooks.no action,no scares,and red paint for blood.The cast is really good,but the movie feels watered down for idiots and stoned teens."
2,Seen this movie before,"I've seen this movie before - it was called Event Horizon. And that was not too good either.If you draw out the plot and character lines via pencil and graph you see that the lines for both movies are identical. The beginning is still too disturbing to recall but does not really serve the story. And the later scenes of the massacre on board, in light of world events, is unfortunate."
3,"Coming straight to dvd, GHOST SHIP 2!","The movie sucked. The ending made me think they would have a sequel, but thank god they didnt do that. The only thing that saved the movie from me throwing it away, was the speical features. It explained more of the movie and made me go oh, thats what happened. I hope they really dont make a sequel to this and im sorry to any fans of this movie who got excited by the my title."
1,horrible,good lord what a horrible movie. You have no sympathy for the characters and no explanation or background as to how they react. Don't even bother renting this it is plain garbage.
2,What gives?,This could have been sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better! The entire movie was predictable and I was very dissapointed. I am a huge fan of Juliana's so I was doubly disappointed. There was a movie a few years back almost identical to this and it too was not good.I give it two stars because the little girl was awesome.The opportunity to make a really creepy horror film set at sea will present itself again and I only hope the director of THAT film will do better.
1,"Absolutely a boring horror film, old story line","The film Ghost Ship is just about a demon who lurk as many crews as he could into the ghost ship and then kill them all. So he could collect their souls. Only a teenage girl always appears in the ghost ship to warn those treasure hunter because the soul of this girl is too pure/innocent to be caught by the demon guy! Therefore you always see that girl walking around the ship and sends out warning. I think that by creating a ghost ship to collect human souls is very rediculous. Save your pocket money, pal!"
2,Event Horizon on a cruise ship,"Aside from the gruesome, gory opening sequence there's really not much to recommend about Ghost Ship. It's basically a rehash of Event Horizon (1997), a much superior horror movie. Event Horizon itself had traces of Alien (1979) and The Shining (1980), but still managed to be an effective, freaky thriller. Ghost Ship offers nothing new, features cardboard characters, predictable situations and annoying music video-type style. This is typical of most horror movies today, though.This could have been a good movie if better work had been done on the script and the director were more intent on making a movie than a music video. Even the plot is derivative of Event Hoziron. I would recommend renting that instead of Ghost Ship. It's a much more effective, scary horror movie. This movie is just a quick fix for the short-attention-span-teen crowd."
5,Awesome!,"I was very pleased with the service and how quickly I received my movie. I wasn't expecting it for another week, but I received it within 4 days! Everything was great and it was wrapped perfectly!"
3,"Sunkissed SoCal, the darkest place","A hard, cruel set of narratives about an equally cruel way of life, L.A. Confidential takes a page from Hollywood and gives us '50's LAPD bigger, uglier, punchier than you hope it really was. James Ellroy's prose is telegraphic and slides with no hesitation in and out of the heads of its three main protagonists, each with their own agendas and sins. As the subplots weave ever closer together, it takes attention to disentangle Ellroy's verbal jumpcuts and hep slang in order to keep track of the criminals, the crimes, the intradepartmental warfare. There's several sets of grisly murders, artistically depraved porn, and Hollywood-star lookalike call girls. No punches are pulled, and the imagery, even evoked in staccato style, is vivid and disturbing. I give Ellroy much credit for avoiding a Hollywood-simple good guy ending, though; there aren't any good guys, just at best people dealing with demons and their aftereffects."
3,MOVIE BETTER THAN THE BOOK!,"I bought this copy for my dad who wanted it in HC. I loved the movie and this book although I can say that Im not overly fond of elroy, I liked the Black Dahlia but all other books sorta fell flat. If you are into crime noir, this is a good book for you."
2,A lower than average read,"The book's premise, plot and prose are OK. I think the movie swept the book along. It is waaaay too long, the characters sometimes border on unbelievable, and the dialogue is monotonous. It's an interesting noir book, with a lot of period references. I say stick with the movie and skip the book."
3,LA Confidential,"I thought that it was too confusing in the beginning jumping back and forth too frequently, had trtouble keeping up with the story line. I did like the ending."
3,IO Gear USB 4-1 Switch,"The switch seems to work satisfactorily. My major complaint is with the positioning of the LED indicator lights that tell which port has been chosen. Instead of locating each of them adjacent to or even inside the switch buttons, where their meaning would be intuitive, for some unfathomable reason, they are in an unmarked vertical column in the middle of the switch housing. This makes it difficult to tell at a glance which port is active. The problem is exacerbated if the housing is lying flat on an elevated surface, and must be viewed at an oblique angle.Perhaps the stylists at IO Gear outnumber the human factors engineers, or they may have none of the latter, but a redesign would make this a far nicer product to use."
3,Gets the Job Done.,"This IOGear switch gets the job done for my system. I have three computers that use a single keyboard and mouse, and this switches them fairly well. The problem is that there is a 3 to 4 second delay in switching the keyboard and mouse, and sometimes the switch has to be toggled back and forth to select the right computer. If this device switched immediately and reliably, it would easily rate more than 5 Stars."
5,A wonder of a book about the wonders of Improv!,"Robert Lowe has written a wonder of a book! He has expertly and creatively transferred his wellspring of Improv knowledge to the written page in a smart and cohesive manner. Not only is this unique and timely book a must for professionals such as actors, public speakers, educators and managers, it is also a book for the layman who seeks to improve their communication skills. This is a book for everyone! Read it and see what I mean!Linda Himes Guyan"
4,Nothing new,"This album is just a collection of songs that are available on the first two albums. It would be a better deal. I would just buy the first two albums by Boston. If you already own the debut and ""Don't Look Back"" don't waste your money."
3,"A bit better than panasonic battery, but only lasts max 2 hours","When you bring XM radio outside for hiking or camping, you expect it to work at least 4-5 hours(people are used to iPod battery performance). Original panasonic battery only lasts 1 hour or less.This one is a bit better giving almost 2 hours, but still it needs better performance. I had to buy 2 of these batteries for my hiking."
4,Insightful,"The Actionscript Language reference is primarily for the intermediate user already familiar with the flash authoring environment and a little scripting.It boasts of a comprehensive coverage of all the Classes(their corresponding properties, methods/handlers)arranged in an alphabetical fashion for easy access. Although laden with examples, DON'T confuse this book for a tutorial. You might wanna consider buyingFlash 8 ActionScript Biblefirst, before delving into this code-centric manual. Or better yet, you can purchase both of them, to complement each other, like i did.I'm not through with the reading, so 4 stars will suffice. For now."
3,"Great time on shipping, but poor quality","I was thrilled to receive this DVD in time for the holidays, but was sorely disappointed at the condition of the disk. There were small chip marks all around the edge of the disk. I realize the risk of purchasing used items, the condition of the disk was worse than I expected."
5,Great product,"I recommend this DVD to anyone is hilarious, is fun Cedric is a classic entertainer, I love it. I could stop laughing from the beginning to the end. Just buy it is worth it."
4,Useful and well-organized info for New Mexico landscaping,"As a fellow person in the landscape design profession locally, I am pleased with my purchase, though I don't agree with every bit of information in the book. Most important, though, Judith illustrates the subtle, yet important factors that influence how plants can grow sucessfully and where in our region. I have had some different experiences with climate data and some plants (Mesquite is one) than she has, but I highly recommend that natives and new arrivals alike apply the facts in this book to avoid the common plant mistakes made in New Mexico!"
5,Helping me through the transition,"I am a novice gardener and native Kansan, and was extremely daunted when moving into my new house made me mistress of a well-established, water-hungry New Mexico garden. By covering each kind of plant individually, with both practical and aesthetic advice, this book has allowed me to proceed with confidence.Its strengths:- I have found very few among my existing plantings that I couldn't identify (and care for) based on the descriptions and color photos in this book.- The coverage includes both xeric and water-hungry plants that are hardy here, which has helped me maintain what I inherited while preparing to transition to a lower water use spread.Its weaknesses:- Now that I have survived spring clean-up, I am interested in more generalized landscaping advice that isn't included here. The focus is entirely on specific plants, with only passing reference to subjects such as designing a layout or installing a drip system."
1,"Stupid, horribly acted, low budget piece of crap.","Even if the reason you are looking at this movie is because it stars hot chick Bobbie Phillips, and you were hoping that you would see her nude in this film, forget about it. She should just wise up and use her assets in a porn movie. But you ain't gettin any of that here. This movie sucks to the ultimate degree of suckdom. Save your money."
1,"A gigantic, steaming, pile of poop sitting in the wild west sun.","Just horrible. If I could give this ""western"" zero stars, I would. Garbage."
1,This album PROBILY SUCKS becuse,There is NOT A SINGLE F-ING SOUND CLIP TO CLICK ON!ADD SOME GOD DAMN IT.ITS COLD HERE!
1,Intermittent connection,"Every time I used this firewire to connect my MyBook external drive the icon indicating the drive was connected would disappear after a few minutes, and the connection was lost. Fortunately, this didn't happen when I was trying to access the drive, but still.... The USB cable from one of my old MP3 players manages to stay connected, so it's not my drive or computer. I sent the firewire back for refund. My dependable old USB cable works just fine and didn't cost me anything extra. Would definitely not recommend."
4,Surprisingly not bad,As much this guy gets he is really not actually not that badinfact he is pretty good to be exact and no I am not kiddingand I like the hook on it.He is actually better then his boysLyrics 9/10 Production 8/10 Overall 8.5/10 This is good
1,Wrong one sent,They sent the wrong one. Bought it for my mom and took them to her (she does not leave in the country) and once I gave them to her found out they were the eye ones and not the ones listed. By now it is too late to return them. Very dissapointed.
1,Horrible Tribute,"Do Not waste your time or money. Since there is no one that has the same level of vocal skill as Prince, it is insulting that anyone thinks he or she would publicly sing a Prince song in tribute. Honestly, I thought this cd would have been instrumental. All acoustic guitar which would have been very good. I was so incredibly disapponted, to hear the horrible vocals of these inferior musicians. Need I say more......I was so upset, I threw it out."
1,I wish I could rate it ZERO,"I cannot for the life of me figure out why people give this book such rave reviews. This has got to be the absolute, rock-bottom WORST piece of waste paper I have ever read. I can't think of ONE good thing to say about it. It is poorly written, badly planned, uninspiring... just BAD. And I don't just mean bad for children... JUST PLAIN GODAWFUL BAD.I read this because it was recommended by a friend, and that's the ONLY reason I finished it. I had to absolutely FORCE myself. UGH! What utter, reeking awfulness! The edition I read included Lillian Hoban's original art, and IT WAS BAD TOO! Just ugly as all heck!I've been informed that Hoban is also the author of ""A Bargain for Frances,"" which is one of my early childhood favorites. What a shame! What happened here???"
3,Not For Children,"I will start by saying that I think this is a very good book. But because it is presented as a book for children, i cannot give it more than 3 stars. It is an EXCELLENT book for adults - extremely well written with vivid, memorable characters. But please don't give this to your children. The secrets of the world come unfurled to all of us in time (the wonder, the mystery and yes, the dark reality of the world). To expose a child to this dark story and essentially rob them of their innocence and their right to their childhood naivete is, well, just not right. There may be some children who might like it, but most will be either traumatized or at best confused. They simply don't have enough life experience to appreciate or understand the message and story in this book, and that life experince should not be forced on them. No matter how much you might love this book, please don't give it to a child."
5,ONE OF HER BEST,"A stalwart Kingsolver fan from her earliest books, I was enchanted by her latest. From her powerful characters to her mesmerizing rural setting, this book amazed me from start to finish. Reading her books are like panning for gold. If you take your time, you will always find a nugget. She manages to subtly link three story lines with characters that were so real and engaging, I didn't want the story to end. Her delicate descriptions of the Kentucky mountains, coyotes, and moths gave me a new appreciation of this wonderful planet we take for granted. If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, don't bother reading the book. BUT if you want a warm, wonderful story with characters you feel like you know, pull up a chair, turn off your phone, send your kids outside and READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Poetic and earthy,"Kingsolver is an enchantress when creating sentences. Sometimes I go back and read a line or two for the beauty of it. A few redundancies that an editor should catch: tiny little, dropped down, rose up.... And, on a factual note, the writer and editor should educate themselves that the term is Down syndrome, not Down's syndrome. When incorrectly using such a term, the writer loses my trust."
4,Kinsolver delivers,"I discoverd Barbara Kingsolver this summer during an Arizona public library initiative prmoting one of her novels (Animal Dreams in ""one book arizona"". I enjoyed Animal Dreams enough to seek her other books and particularly enjoyed Prodigal Summer and Poisonwood Bibles the most. I just love when you find a new author and race to read everything she has written.Prodigal Summer was rich in character development - it focussed separately on several characters that you kept reading to figure out how they were related. I enjoyed the focus on nature and farming as a background for the purity of hard work and cycles of good and bad that life presents. This book presented a realistic view of life full of positive things, but not a life with fairytale endings."
5,if you love the earth.....read this,if you love the earth more than its people....you absolutely must read this latest effort by my fellow kentuckian barbara kingsolver.her understanding of how systems work - particilarly the appalachian region ecosystem is very insightful and thoughtful. the book displays a kentucky woman's abiding respect for both her natural and cultural heritage.and....a deep understanding of free-spirited human nature.parting comment.....a truly sensual book.
2,Enough already!,"Barbara Kinsolver is a good writer. I loved Poisonwood Bible. This book started out well, but got tedious fairly soon. I found I was annoyed with the characters and getting predator prey relationship and pesticide lessons jammed down my throat. Yes, yes, nature is a beautiful web of life, etc. etc. Don't environmentalists know that they alienate as many as they convert with the lessons they stridently proclaim? This preaching annoyed me to the point that the whole book was just an irritating experience. Too bad."
2,Three short stories,"This book was three short stories. The characters from each of the stories did not interact with the others. I kept hoping that eventually everyone would tie together but, no, the ending was extremely disappointing and ruined the rest of the book for me."
2,Criticism of P. Knopick 's Review,"When blanket statements are made, as in Knopick's review regarding Kingsolver's political views, it is my contention that it must be footnoted as to where he obtained the information that generated his formation of such opinions. Otherwise, one receives the information as nothing more than slander.In addition, we probably would not read many an author if we knew and did not care for their politics, lifestyles, food choices, color of hair, etc. Get it?"
5,"Ecology, Compassion and the Human Condition","Ecology, Compassion and the Human Condition all come together in a spellbinding story of several folks in a small town including a woman with a PhD in ecology who has returned to the hometown of her youth to work as a park ranger. The Chapters in this book are crafted uniquely and seemingly independent of one another at first, but are beautifully crafted to eventually weave together and disclose a history. The characters are believable and realistic. The ecological/botanical topics in the book have been researched and assist to bring forth a compelling read."
1,Prodigal Summer,"This is a shallow, didactic book written by someone who feels she must preach to the peasants out there who are foolish enought to read what she writes. There isn't one person in the book to feel simpatico with. They all either use others, or let themselves be used by others. Ms. Kingsolver gave us an interesting read with the Poisonwood Bible, but there hasn't been another of her books that I would recommend. I've finally decided that I don't need to read another of her books."
2,not as good as her usual,"More preachy and pedantic than her usual. 28 day cycle, full moon, universal attraction of males to ovulating females is way overdone to the point of being ridiculous!! The 40something hermit coming out of the woods to give birth also kind of silly!Kingsolver's books are usually terrific reads. This one not so."
4,The story behind is worth the reading,"First, let's get the nit-picking out of the way. This book does not devote a whole section to preaching, as did Poisonwood Bible, but the urge to educate the reader was dispensed throughout. Women are smart, men need convinced. Of what? primarily that organic is good and chemicals are bad. However, this woman recalls the last organic item she purchased, orange juice, tasted like carrot juice gone rancid. So I was't buying. However, as the interwined characters' stories were gradually developed , I became increasingly enthralled as the book progressed and the linkages exposed. I hope for Kingsolver continues this one on to the next generation, of the people that is. A little less coyote and birdcalls would not be missed. Overall, a really enjoyable novel."
5,I didn't want it to end!,"I loved this book and the caricatures that Kingsolver created. I was really sad when I reached the end - I wanted more! It was amazing how each character was interlinked, but very distantly. It allowed the story to weave between them, yet you were reading about three very separate lives. Beautifully done - this is my favorite author!"
4,Beautifully written story,"Okay, so it's not the Poisonwood Bible--but why do we want her to write another Poisonwood Bible? I enjoyed Prodigal Summer and learned quite a lot about ecology in the process. Granted, I do eat organic produce and would label myself as an environmentalist...if you are not sympathetic to these views, you might not like this book. I enjoyed all three stories, and I especially liked the characters of Nanny and Deanna. I didn't want the book to end, and when it did end, I felt that their stories were incomplete--I wanted to know what would happen with Deanna and Lusa.If you like to read lyrical prose about nature and creation, combined with a good story, this is your book."
5,Kingsolver does it again,"I must admit I am biased, being a big fan of Kingsolver's work. This is just as good as her other books (except for perhaps The Poisonwood Bible, which was in my opinion the pinnacle of her writing). I very much enjoyed this book. Not being of a scientific mind myself, I found that Kingsolver's writing made it interesting, and it was not too technical. It was key to the development of the story, and far different than any other book out there. My only quibble with the book is that for some reason Kingsolver seems to be man bashing in this book. All of the female characters are sensistive, strong, intelligent, and always right, while the male characters have a tendency to be bumbling idiots, oblivious to the nuances of nature, both human and wild. I think I would have like to see more well-rounded characterization in that area, but otherwise, this is a fine work."
2,Nature romance lacks originality,"My first Kingsolver novel ... expected much more than formulaic prose where we 1) meet experts of a certain field who 2) confront enemies 3) who conquer and divide quite easily, etc. The book was predictable, and the characters were cliche-ish. The women had the expected traits of feminine heroism, yet with sensitivity towards all life forms. I barely made it through this book. I love nature writing, yet this was overstated, hardly philosophical, except in a very cliche-ish overstated way. The minor characters, the townspeople, were very one-dimensional, portrayed very narrowly, not a complex group at all. The major characters were differentiated from them in a superficial way. If you want to read a much better book which explores themes within nature read ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"" by Annie Dillard."
3,Unbalanced,"I loved both this book and Poisonwood Bible because Kingsolver writes so well but still found both books flawed, not because of the preachy tone (while Prodigal Summer is terribly preachy, the sermon is at least well thought out and the issues fully presented) but because only the women are fully rounded characters. As in Poisonwood Bible, the men here (Eddie Bondo, Ricky, Old Man Walker, etc. etc. etc) are all cartoonish, paper cut-outs. The women (at least those who you actually get to see up close) can care about family, the environment, and life while the men all get to be unfeeling, stupid louts. As a man I find it a little insulting."
3,A different Kingsolver experience,"I can recommend readiing this book even with only giving it 3 stars. It's in a lovely setting, the characters are good, the story moves at a nice pace, and the overall feeling from the book is satisfying. I'm not sure I can quite believe the main characters actions at several times, and that I attribute to my personal likings. I think after reading Poisonwood Bible I was also expecting something other than what this story offers. It's different and experience."
1,AWFUL ROMANCE NOVEL,"If you expect a witty, funny, interesting or anything along the lines of Kingsolver's prior novels, this book is not for you.If you expect Jackie Collins Romance with a far fetched story line about the classic city girl vs. country boy, then THIS IS YOUR BOOK!"
4,Pleasant reading,Barbara Kingsolver obviously has an agenda to push with this book but she's preaching to the choir as far as I'm concerned. She has done a nice job of defending the characters in her book that she presents as misguided or ignorant so there are no real villans. I enjoyed reading it.
5,Another Kingsolver winner!,"Once again I am captivated by Barbara Kingsolver's brillant writing skills. Her use of rich language, similies and metaphors lures the reader in from the first paragraph to the last. She shows her knowledge of the environment about which she writes beautifully while entertaining the reader with the plot twists including local humor and colloquialisms. I felt as if I was visiting the Katskill mountian, hiking along with her character Deanna as she maintains the Forest Service trails. The characters in the book are interesting, humorous and well developed by the author."
2,"2 ** audio, but 5 ***** reading it yourself","This is my favourite book of all time. I am an avid reader and I have read this book three times. I have not read any other book twice, even. A friend referred me to a link of the audiobook and I cringed.If you do not absolutely need to listen to it, please read it. It makes the world of difference.The voice does not go with the contents because it is too shallow, too young (sounding), too monotonous. My friend, also an avid reader, forced herself to listen to the entire audio version but she said she almost fell asleep a few times.Such a shame, that a fabulous book like this has been voiced as it is."
5,Prodigal Summer,"One of my all time favorite books, I own it in hardback, paperback and Kindle versions. The characters are well defined and you want to learn more about them. In particular Barbara Kingsolver has described the flora and fauna so well that you can almost see them. I have read this book over and over and will again. If you like nature and novels this is the book for you."
1,Didn't engage me,"I got about halfway through this novel before I gave up on it. While I appreciate the setting (the mountains of North Carolina) and the themes (what is man's relationship to nature? how do we steward the earth while looking after our own needs?), I could not relate to any of the characters, and I disliked the dynamic of male vs. female, destroyer vs. nurturer that was being set up. I definitely didn't find this novel as engaging as either The Poisonwood Bible or Animal, Vegetable, Miracle."
2,Better Books Out There,This book had a few relative good points. However there was nothing in here that could not be found in more enjoyable publications. The reading was dry and the book was easily put down.
1,highly disappointing,This book is nothing more than a list of every OTHER book the author has ever read on the subject. I expected information and instead each chapter is a review of someone else's book. Unless u need a list of bdsm books save ur money and buy something else.There are no gems of wisdom. Instead the author tells stories about what he learned from reading such and such book. It actually started to peak my interest as to whether or not the author was getting a cut of the royalties from the books he was recommending.Save ur money n look elsewhere.
4,Only one Curly short included,"Although the cover of the Spook Louder DVD shows Curly, it is in fact the only episode with Curly in it, the rest are all with Shemp. This DVD only contains six shorts whereas the last Columbia Stooge DVD, All the World's a Stooge, had seven. While this is still a must have for Stooge fans, people that don't like Shemp might want to pass on this one. The shorts on this are: Spook Louder, Mummy's Dummies, Shivering Sherlocks, The Ghost Talks, Hokus Pokus, and Fright Night"
2,Missing his most popular song in spanish,"This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: ""Lisa de los ojos azules"". I wouldn't buy this CD without that song."
2,Cheap and poorly assembled,"Having purchased this along with a spare cylinder I was very disapointed when it arrived and the plunger was very stiff and wouldn't line up correctly. Had to take it apart and using a Dremel tool, reamed out the plunger and now it works...Just like the Traditions nipple wrench and capper, which both broke on first time use, this item is very poorly made and cheap..."
1,doesn't work for colt replicas,"The stand is supposed to be for Pietta black powder .44 caliber revolvers. On my Pietta 1860 and 1851 cylinders, the plunger was to big to fit in the chambers, so it was unusable. From the other feedback I see, apparently it works for 1858 Remington replicas, but as for the Colt replicas, it does not. The plunger also seemed to me to be too short to properly seat the balls into the cylinders, if it would have been narrow enough."
3,"Good toy, but not a great toy.",Was expecting more vibration from the toy and it is hard for younger kids to figure out how to activate it. Other than those two things it is a fun toy.
2,Sorry I bought this,If you think you'd enjoy a tablespoon or so of coconut oil in hot water before every meal then this is for you. It's supposed to help you to feel satiated-it made me nauseous. The diet plan is not something I could possibly stick to. The grocery list is daunting. Good info on fats in general and why coconut oil is good for you.I don't usually review unless I feel positive about something but I wish someone had told me before I bought this.I'd like a book that tells you how to incorporate coconut into you diet without totally changing your diet.
1,not what is advertised,"bad item. not an amazon product, therefor shipping etc in different category. web site not clear. best to stay away."
5,Sinatra+Torch music=Perfection!,"I heard this album when it first came out in the 50's. I was around 8 or so, and from the moment I heard the first note,I was hooked. The combination of Sinatra, the songs chosen for this ""concept"" album,the arrangements, and the incredible musicians is indescribably beautiful. I seem to remember one of Sinatra's kids saying that this album was depressing...I have found it to the one thing that has always managed to get me through tough times in my life...just knowing that there was a voice like his in this world makes me feel good about living. I think that this is his best album, ever. Give it a listen..you'll be hooked, too.Annie"
5,An unquestionable classic,"One of the great Sinatra albums, with Come Fly with Me and Songs for Swingin Lovers. Buy it now if you don't already own it."
5,Blue Eyes,"This is one of the better albums, yes I'm old, that I have in my collection. Would recommend it to everyone"
4,Pretty Good,Disney's Greatest Hits met my needs. My 2 year old loves disney songs. The problem is some of her favorites in the movies has been changed on the CD. They don't always use the orginal songs and not for the better.
4,Fun music for children.,"This CD has tons of disney's songs on it. I was a little dissapointed with some of the renditions of the songs, and my 4 year old thinks they sound funny (that is her way of saying they don't sound anything like the movie). Overall about half of the songs were straight from the movie, a few are newer renditions, some are jazzier updates, and a select few were horrible. We have had fun overall though listening to the songs."
4,See it made.,"This is an excellent video showing the technology developed over centuries by great craftsmen to produce not simply a weapon, but a work of art.The video covers the art *and* science of producing a katana - the samurai's sword. It begins with workers making steel from ore. It moves to the swordmaker's art of forging a magnificently crafted weapon perfectly suited for the style of combat the culture revered. It shows that polishing and sharpening are a separate art also practiced by great craftsmen.There is a great deal of science in the video that explains the properties of steel, how it is hardened, and how the weapon requires different steels to accomplish its task.It isn't perfect, but this video is very good!"
4,Good NOVA episode but it could have been better,"This was a very interesting NOVA episode but it might have been even better if they had focussed more on the science of steel and a little less on actors playing Samurai at battle. That said it was very good and the scenes presenting fencers training were a good addition. Of this aspect, I particularly enjoyed the slow-motion shot of the swordsman cutting an arrow in mid-flight."
4,Looks and cleans up well,If you are looking for something that looks good and cleans up well this is the can i would recommend. Also having the hole vs. having a lid i think it helps keep the mess few and far between.
4,A step up,"A little more rockin', much better produced. I'm sure I'll enjoy this more than ""Kansas"". In case anyone is wondering, the version of ""A Little More"" is a bit different than what's on ""Listen Louder""."
5,solid lyrics,"Anybody who desires to listen to some solid Christian lyrics will enjoy this. The sound is a bit different than Kansas, but not at all disappointing. I find this to be a well-balanced CD--lyrically and musically appealing. This lady is loaded with talent."
4,"Not as Good as Kansas, but a Good Sophomore Effort","There are some great high moments on this record, ""Peace"" is definitely one of them. But my favorite track from this album is ""Diamond in the Rough."" The music is wonderful, there is either a banjo or mandolin accompanying some really nice guitar work. That song is the best song on this record. The lyrics of this album kind of fell flat for me. The music seems to be moving away from the Christian themes that dominated Jennifer Knapp's previous release and more toward humanistic failings. This album was much less inspirational for me, but more about falling and be insecure in your faith. From a Christian perspective it wasn't very uplifting for me. It was almost like an album that fits between faith and doubt, but I did enjoy songs like a ""Little More,"" ""All Consuming Fire,"" and ""When Nothing Satisfies."""
2,WEAR EASE...GREAT IF THEY WOULD WORK,"I really like shoes that have velcro closures, I like them because they are easy to put on and take off. This product was very disappointing, I purchased a set of white and a set of black and I spent close to an hour trying to figure out how to make them work, I tried different ways and they still didn't do what they were supposed to do. Yes, there are directions, but the directions probably make sense to the person who wrote the directions. I tried to find a video on how to use them but no luck. If anyone reads this maybe you can show some light on this product, its a great idea, but very disappointing. I was going to give it one star, but I couldn't say I hated it, because it must work but I don't know how."
4,Great CD,This is a cd that tells the truth about many subjects in the world and it also has some great music that you can dance to
2,DVD quality ploor,"The story lines of the two seasons were excellent, as well as the acting. Having seen these originally on TV, however, it appears some of the Mystery intros were deleted. Also, the DVD production quality was very poor: there were pauses, skips, and what might be slippages in both sets. I doubt I would purchase any DVDs from this production company again."
5,Using on Xbox Kinect in Theater Room,"I use My Xbox Kinect in a theater room with a projector. I purchased and use this cable to exted te Kinect to be placed in the front of the room by the screen while the Xbox 360 is at the back of the room by the projector. It plugged right in and worked great, no problems after weeks of play."
3,Occasionally cuts out on wireless mouse,"I wired this through my ceiling and dropped it into my living room. It allows me to play BF3 on my 96"" 1080p projector.BF3 requires flawless timing and precision. I bought this item because numerous reviews stated that it works flawlessly. IT DOESN'T. Once every 1-2 minutes the pointer will cut out for a second. Very frustrating."
5,Perfect - does what it should,"I bought this long USB cable to use with my laptop and shoot tethered with my Canon 5D Mark II camera. It's beautiful. Pictures go right from my camera to the computer and show up seconds after on my laptop screen. It's an awesome way to shoot in a studio environment. Plus, when you're done, the photos are already all on your computer."
3,Demasiado básico,"Si buscas un libro donde aparezcan los conceptos más básicos del ballet, este es perfecto.El problema es que abarca muchos temas y profundiza poco en todos."
5,A book that describes the essence of the beauty of nature!,"This book needs plenty of reading, as it is full of ideas and images that slowly come together to form a whole. It describes ""the quality with no name"" that make some buildings come ""alive"" and be wonderful to live in. It is this same quality that makes nature so appealing. The quality is formed from patterns - the second book in the trilogy ""A Pattern Language"" describes a large number of patterns for architecture in detail.It is my current opinion that when the ""quality without a name"" is present in a human relationship it is called ""love"". If I am right, then in a way this book answers the eternal question ""what is love?"". Powerful eh?[I discovered this book following a recommendation of ""A Pattern Language"" on an object-oriented computing course. The power of patterns in computer software is only starting to be realised]"
3,A great book about...books,"If you adore reading, you will soon find yourself wrapped up in the essays that compose this book by Anne Fadiman. Not only do we get to see her love of books, but we see how her upbringing brought along this love and the how she rears her children to embrace books as she and her husband do. The reader is swept up in Anne's conversational way of describing from things that irk her (in an essay about correct punctuation) to the emotional task of trying to merge her and her husband's libraries. Over the course of the 18 essays I found I almost enjoyed them all. One or two essays seemed a bit out of place, but for the most part, I just wished it was longer. :)"
5,I found A commrad.,I saw he speak on her book it was great! I thought I was the only one who that excentric about books. Loved every minute of it.Its like finding a long lost friend.
2,"So, wait...is she angry about something?","I have really enjoyed Margaret Cho's standup, and my political beliefs tend to the left, so I thought I would really enjoy this book. Instead, I just find myself bored with her anger--there is nothing incisive or interesting about anything she has to say. There's plenty to be unhappy with in our current social and political climate, but all she does is explain how unhappy she is, without much insight beyond that.Reading this book is like being trapped at a dinner party with a teenager that has just discovered liberalism. Just about anything white and/or straight is automatically a target for her vitriol."
3,"Yes, there's a trend happening here","First off, no problem with the cover - I'd love to have a poster of this! But the content - it's more ranting than insightful, and not in a particularly entertaining way. Although most of the subjects Margaret covers are worth covering, I just didn't walk away from this book feeling like it was time well spent. Have no doubt, it -is- possible to do politics, comedy and social satire well, but the overall tenor is so insular that if you're not already a member of Margarets' noisy coalition of special interests, you may be left feeling unwelcome and unamused."
1,not right,"This item say Cook for The Cure Chopper and it shows Pink,like its suppose to be. But when I ordered,a plain white one arrived. I returned it and today, got a plain white one again!!Now I have to worry if they are going to get it right the third time around. This is a x'mas gift,hope they dont mess it up."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this item over a year ago, seldom used it and it is already broken. I believe it is a design flaw. It has a recessed button in the base that should start the chopper when the bowl and cover are properly seated. Probably the second time I went to use this the button in the cover is not pushing hard enough on the button in the base. If I use a pick to press the button the motor will run, but it is impossible to use since the button is covered up when the bowl is in place. It's a very pretty color pink, but that's about it. I had a Cuisinart for years before it finally gave out. I'm buying another Cuisinart."
5,Boobie Support Kitchen Aid Chopper,"Even though where it says what color it says white and the box said white It was most definitely pink! I am a big supporter of the Breast Cancer Foundation and I am also a big foodie - being a chef and all. This is a great tool for at home, the pulse button has to be held down and thats the only thing I dont like about it but I dont mind because its for home use only. Its cute and doesnt take up a lot of space at all."
4,Le Chateau watch,All was good. got the product on time in good condition and it works well up to this point. only issue was i did not receive instructions.
1,Sperber's Writing Binge,"Did Murray Sperber ever learn to think critically? If he tried to talk tough with Bobby Knight using sports jargon he would be laughed out of the room! Who knows more sports jargon and has all the winning cards, the dumb jock or the arrogant book worm?Sperber argues that scholar/teachers are outdated but a rank/tenure committee can count papers or books or cites where as only the worst and best teachers have a record.Ironically, coaches are one of the few teaching species that have a demonstrable record which is why Knight could get away with anything.Grade schools have discouraged teachers in droves by trying to justify raises using test scores and bias evaluations. Should research universities turn into popularity contests and experiments in test taking or should the public trust traditional proven methods of retention and promotion?"
2,I don't know if I'd recommend reading the whole thing...,"While I did enjoy the use of surveys to create this book, it does seem that Dr. Sperber mentioned only the survey answers that fit his agenda. I'm left with many questions. Like one another reviewer already mentioned, why does Dr. Sperber teach at a Big Time State U?The book was very repetitive, seems like there was a page # quota that needed to be met. While I'm glad I read the book, it definitely could have been shorter, and I probably would have enjoyed it more if it was."
1,Vintage 1980s trash.....,"While nowhere near the level of badness achieved by part five, this film manages to offend despite its attempts to singlehandedly end the Cold War. The Rocky character has never been less compelling and Apollo's death is as silly as it is predictable. More a series of music video-like sequences than a narrative film, part four is over the top, insulting, and, to top it off, includes an end sequence that strains the credulity of even the most naive individual. No magic, no charm, no excitement....just greased up boxers who never learned to guard their faces in a fight."
2,Even Apollo Can't Save This Lame Excuse For a Movie,"The only reason this film gets two stars instead of one is Apollo Creed. Apollo dancing to ""Living in America"" to warm up the crowd before a fight makes this movie worth seeing. Otherwise, this sequel is a bomb. Rocky's training sequence is pretty cool, but it does not change the fact that Dolph Lundren, a man who makes insurance seminars seem exciting by comparison, plays the opponent. The series reaches an all-time low when an arena filled with Russians begins fervently cheering for Rocky to overcome one of their own countrymen. Puh-lease!"
1,Picture looks so grainy at times. what a disappointment,"I like Rocky 4. It's one of the most entertaining for me and It has an awesome soundtrack. I purchased Predator in blu ray and it looks awesome so when I popped Rocky 4 in I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality. I was annoyed by all the grainy looking scenes. They need to do a better job at transferring these movies , or have them remastered cause it looks like crap. No thanks to fox connect. I love this movie but extremely dislike the blu ray version."
1,Don't buy from this guy,"The product was indicated as new. Came without seal at top of the disc case and DVD was scratched and had fingerprints. Obviously, he marketed this as new and it was not. I call that fraudulent."
2,Ooooo...Rocky fights He-Man!,"Ok, no nukes, the cold war, it was 1985 after all. No excuse for this one. It's better than Rocky 3 though. I hated to see Apollo go out like that but you had to wonder when one of these guys would get killed. Dolph Lungren makes Stallone look like a midget. Drago is stiff and awkward. So is this movie."
2,smells bad..,"this stuff smells bad, I had to open the garage because i could not stand how bad it smells. This product is soso, I would not recommend it. it also does'nt change color once sprayed on part, it just becomes glazed. not satisfied at all.."
5,"An outstanding, highly readable history of economic thought!","I have read four histories of economics this year, and this is the best by far. It is a fascinating, highly readable history. Yet it also provides enough theory to leave the reader with a deeper understanding of current state of economic science and the theoretical milestones that got it where it is today.Some other reviewers charge the author with bias. The author clearly believes the Austrian school has made significant, underappreciated contributions to economic theory. But, this is not a book about the Austrian school. It is an outstanding, evenhanded, general history of economic thought."
3,Great to dip in and out of,A very enjoyable read with fascinating looks at a variety of fascinating words from the languages of the world
3,Differences between the matter and present Japanese,"I only read about the chapter of Japanese, but I think it is a little bit strange. Some Japanese words the author chose are not used resently. So these don't express update Japanese. For example, the author refers about Japanese word, 'myo' , but there are expressed only one meaning. But the word is not used as that meaning. So from the point of Japanese view, it is hard to say that all contents of Japanese don't become reference, but at the same time some contents refer interesting point and make pointed remark. It was interesting to read about Japanese which are refered by foreign writer!"
4,a great rock cd,well its great whites second cd and its great with such tracks as face the day she shakes me and the title cut there version of gimmie some lovin and a great ballad waiting for love its a fine cd
3,Funny...in spots.,"Margaret's comedic timing is a bit off in this, her second feature film. She waits too long to deliver the 1--2 punch, as if the audience won't follow her if she doesn't wait that for that extra pulse. She talks a lot about her sex life, and the pacing and humor of the film slows considerably when she does this.The segments about her mother are classic, though, and they make viewing this dvd time well spent.Recommended for fans. Others should rent."
2,I should have read the other reviews,"I bought this DVD because it was supposed to be cutting edge political and racial humor. I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it was disappointing.To make the comparison to Richard Pryor is what offends me. Richard, like Robin Williams are comedy icons. Richard influenced a whole generation of comics from Eddie Murphy to Chris Rock.Cho is not even close. I didn't laugh at any of the jokes which are targeted away from the audience that who love Richard Pryor or the Kings of Comedy. This is the amateur hour. Not as good as Roseanne Barr or a host of other female comics.Trying to use the hip-hop references is another marketing ploy. No one in the Hood would find this material funny. I agree with those who have said this is contrived and forced. All hype , no substance.I should have read the customer reviews before I bought it."
5,Excellent food for large dogs,"Our chocolate lab has always been on Wellness products; we had a recommendation from our trainer who said it actually helped dogs' blood sugar and their temperment as well. He is 4 and has never been to the vet except for annual check-ups, and is the best behaved chocolate (or any color) lab we've ever seen, so we owe a lot to these well-made products. We did find that the double protein that Wellness changed over to (Old Mother Hubbard food) wreaked havoc on his digestion, though, but when we switched to this ""simple"" food, all has improved. It is more expensive, so perhaps by switching the formula, they are making more money on all those people who like the brand and want a solution. They got us...oh well..."
4,Not her best outing,"Moments of the old Streisand magic--when the whole world gasps silently at her every phrase--but a bit too chatty for a DVD and the CD makes these interludes even more annoying. I'm sure if you were there, these distractions might have been part of the evening, but unfortunately they do not transfer well to recording. While the voice is croaky at times, at others she is simply breathtaking. Inconsistent, but worth it for her legion of fans."
2,Where is the information about IIS?,"This book talks in general about everything! NT Domains, TCP/IP, Networking, and so on. I kept looking for information on IIS and was hard pressed to find it. If you are looking for a book ABOUT IIS, and not Everthing about Windows NT, then look elsewhere..."
4,Recticles are slightly tilted,Upon opening the scope and checking it out it seems the recticles (cross hairs) are tilted. Its unfortunate that they are but its not bad enough for me to go through the hassle to send back and get a new one. After all it is a $30 scope and will only be used for plinking and maybe small game hunting. Other than that it is a good scope amazons shipping time and quality were fantastic and I have no regrets.
3,"Justin at his Peak,","Im not a big fan of Justin but this song is just grate. The video is allso so grate. It blends so well with the feeling of the song. Its possibly the fourth best video ive ever seen after Ray of Light by Madonna, Scream by Michael Jackson and Janand All is full of love by Bjork.Its an amazing song and my favurte bit is the part when the chorus sings: ""cry me a river, o cry me a river"" at the end of the song."
3,Ninth season,Frasier serie is always entertaning but it lacks the sparks of the previous series. Loks like they had to pull it together to complete the ten years period.
2,technical glitch on 2nd DVD,"Anyone else notice one of the episodes on DVD 2 (I think it was Junior Agent or Bully For Martin) has some weird audio glitch on the audience laughing? I don't know if I just got a bad copy, but everytime the laughter happened it sounds markedly different than normal - staticy, way too much treble, kind of muted-sounding. Really bizarre."
4,No probelms,It came quickly and was very entertaining. I will wrap my apples and tomatoes in nylons and see how it goes.
4,Handlebar,I received the order more quickly than expected. The handlebar was exactly as described. I would definintely do business with Niagara again.
2,An autobiography by a well-known NT scholar,"Rather disappointed with this book. Bought it at the local Borders and found its prose rushed; was the copyeditor asleep? I found long stretches rather tedious, not enhanced by the author's strong ego, which lacks discernment about what the reader might find engaging and what s/he might not. I appreciate much of Crossan's work, such as In Search of Paul, and this one has many good paragraphs. But the whole work never quite seems to come together."
2,Dissapointing,"This book would have gotten just one star if it weren't for the last chapter, which is brilliant. Some of the theological musings are interesting but most of this book was just surface level. There is no passion in this book. This book makes Crossan look very shallow. Never does he go into his own spiritual journey or even really his own personal feelings. Much of the details in his life are quite boring as well. Leaving the priesthood is interesting, but he never really goes into why he left the priesthood. Very dissapointing. I'd suggest that if someone still wanted to read this book, get it used and know what to expect."
4,Perfect Fit,"After trying to get the best price and the fastest shipment, i ended up getting it from herePrice was better than local stores and some other online storesI got the item witin days and was perfect fit.Great quality"
3,A Comedy Classic Butchered beyond recognition,"I usually cannot stop reading a book in Adam's hilarious Hitchiker series. It takes me about a day on average to read one of these (usually) 200 page books. So Long and Thanks for all the Fish didn't succeed so well. It's probably because of the editing necessary to make an abridged version. It is my opinion that books shoudln't be abridged. A half size Adam's book is worth about as much as a 500 page Les Miserables. If you want a good reading experience, go out and get the full version!"
2,"Good book, bad editing","It almost seems like someone translated the entire book into German using Babelfish (the translation program, not the fish) and back into English. Some words are unreadable and make it hard to understand what is being said. The parts that can be read are quite ammusing, but this was very poorly done."
3,Excellent with titles,"Lovely carrying on in the spirit of the ""trilogi of 4 "" it defines. Not for someone who has not read the others in the trilogy."
3,I Love Wings,"Wings is one of those shows that leaves you feeling good after watching an episode. When I need to forget about the day and all of the problems in it, Wings lets me forget them.On to the DVD features. This DVD set features are non-existent and now has no ""ALL Play"" feature and you can't skip the end credits making you fast forward through them to get to the Main Menu to select the next episode. The manufacturer must be getting really lazy since the DVD has nothing but episodes and removed one of the nice features from the previous Wings DVD Sets.Disk Error: My second disk doesn't allow me to directly play the first episode correctly; it plays with no sound. I have to skip to the next episode and then go back to the first one and now the sound plays.Overall I'm happy with Season 4 even with the issues stated above."
3,Bruce Campbell made me root for the bad guy.,"Poor Sean Astin I keep thinking of him in the Lord of the Rings. As an action hero he really does not cut it. He is a great actor, but this role was all wrong. Then you have a bald Bruce Campbell as the evil terrorist. About half way through the movie I found myself rooting for him. That just ain't right. Then again, it is hard not to root for Bruce Campbell he is a living embodiment of an underdog."
3,Great series - however I ordered the whole set and didn't know this movie was included!,"I wasn't aware the full season set I purchased had this move included it so I'm still trying to decide whether to return it. I just hate to pay the shipping (watch every penny, you know.) I only rated it ok for that reason. The move is excellent."
4,Ms.Pretty Eyes,"I saw Murderous Klick perform at a club here in Vegas with Clika and they're are crazy. There music is nice but they are wild as hell. I know that alot of my homeboyz play there album, my favorite song is Sin City Club.Pretty Eyes..."
3,SilverStone FP32B,Like the unit very much. I would like it better if thefront panel was available in something other than black.
2,Disappointed,"I had to purchase this text book (7th edition) for my maternity class in nursing school and was disappointed. This text was very boring, made easy concepts very technical, and lacked clear info on nursing diagnosis. I have always had text books that very clearly explain what the appropriate nursing diagnosis would be along with interventions and goal suggestions. This text doesn't offer any of this which is VERY frustrating when you are trying to create nursing care plans. I will have to go to the library and borrow maternity books that better explain maternity nursing diagnosis, interventions, and goals in order to complete my care plans. The students in my class all generally hate this text. Reading it is like watching paint dry."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!!,***ZERO STARS*** This game has been labeled as a sick joke played upon the victims world wide that have suffered from a brain aneurysm or lost a loved one to this tragic illness. Please show that you care by boycotting the game.
2,Disappointing,"This manual is too specific to just the car that was dismantled. The instructions were dead wrong for my 1997 Deville for door panel and window motor replacement. If I had continued trying to pry the door fasteners off, I would have broken the attachment hooks which replaced the press-in fasteners."
4,Excellent!,"This dictionary is pretty thorough and is an excellent complement to your library of research materials dealing with prehispanic cultures. The author has clearly done her research and presents the material in detail. I'd like more photos/drawings, but there are definitely enough for the task."
5,Simply PERFECT Vocal POP/TRANCE,"A DELICIOUS Song this is. It has a VERY CATCHY Pop Melody, all covered in some of the Most Beautiful and Powerful Trance sounds.Give this song a try, and if you like a Good Melody, than I can almost Guarantee that you will Like (if Not Love) this Sweet song.You do not have to be a fan of Trance or dance to like this song, because it has a very Good POP MELODY and thus has a Strong MASS APPEAL. Just think of IAN VAN DAHL's ""Castles In the Sky"" ALICE DEEJAY's ""Better Off Aloone"", or LASGO's ""Something"", among many other Great EuroDance/Trance/Pop songs.Foggy also has two other good tracks: ""Your Eyes"" and ""Take the Future"". I hope there will be a Full-Length album released. A Very Worthy Buy.Thank You and Enjoy"
1,Cheap Product,"I have had one of these for 2 years now. It runs 8 hours per day, 7 days a week. It is in my shop. After two years, the little lights are burning out and also changing colors. You cannot read it anymore. Also, the software is hard to use and unstable. I will never purchase another one of these...even an upgraded model.The company will NOT warranty this product because I did not purchase it directly from them. I purchased it through Amazon. I have learned my lesson about warranties when purchasing from 3rd parties like Amazon and their companies they play broker for."
4,Best ending this year.,A spectacular ending to an unspectacular movie. The ending sent electric tingles down my spine.
5,Timeless,Classic storytelling. The lead character mustface up to deal with a trivial challenge andin doing so they must confront their own fears.The scenary and music complement each stageof their journey. This movie was a surprisingfind at Sedona.
5,Excellent quality and service,"This is a quality product. Good materials, well-made; all ports work; the design is attractive and compact; hub stays on desk, no mounting necessary. Very good price, fast shipping. Considerate followup by Cyberguys to boot -- these people know that doing business is about providing value and service (not just 'making money')."
4,"Decent, have not had problems for 5 months","The Apple developer tool USB Prober on Mac OS X identifies this as a Multi-TT hub. System Profiler *also* identifies it as only supplying 500ma per port when the power adapter is plugged in. This is sufficient to charge an iPhone 4s (off or in-use), but not an in-use iPad 2. It *will* charge the iPad2 with the screen off.If you try and check, the screen powers up, exceeds the current necessary, and then it will say ""Not Charging."" It's kind of like the refrigerator light like that, except you know it charged by leaving a half-dead battery on it for 12 hours."
2,Slowly Dying,"When I first saw this I was very happy. I needed more ports, and this seemed perfect. The first time I used it, with my wireless mouse, the first port didn't work. So, I tried the second port, and it worked fine. However, after a couple of weeks the second port stopped working, so I moved my wireless mouse to the third port, and, once again, it worked fine. However, after only 1 1/2 weeks the third port stopped working, so I have moved my mouse to Port #4. I am starting to believe this will be only temporary, and within the year the other ports will die, and I will be looking for another solution. So far, I am very disappointed with this product, as it seems to be dying a slow death."
5,7-port USB 2.0 Hub,"Works great--does what it is supposed to do. Because you are able to plug the unit in with the included power cord, it seems to work better and seems much more reliable than hubs without power connections."
5,Another great Amazon experience.,"Bought this hub yesterday after reading reviews on every budget priced hub on Amazon. A: Great price, didn't need to purchase separate USB cable...Really Belkin? B: Arrived in approx. 28 hrs. I ordered it while I was at work yesterday morning, it arrives noonish on my day off. U can't beat that C: Works great. The first thing that I did was to put a plug into each port, and try out every peripheral attached. Everything worked I am very satisfied and will definitely recommend this to friends and co-workers."
5,Great Reliable Port,This little USB port is great. I have had it for about two months with no problems. No lag and no software to install.
4,HP d145 just in and great,This hard to find new all-in-one printer scanner fax copier meets all my needs and has one benifet over the Canon F50. I reviewed and looked over both. The Canon F50 is a bit more attactive but even though it has a wide flat bed scanner it will only scan letter size flat bed documents. The HP d145 has a legal size flat bed scanner. I need the legal size copier for real estate work so I went with the HP. They will both copy or fax legal through the automatic feed tray. The paper feeder wheels are wider on the HP. Reviews indicate the HP software does not dominate the operating system software as much as the Canon does. I like that. If more attractive and not such a dark color it would get five stars from me. The HP d145 installation CD should be Version 3.0 not Version 1.0 as was packed with some units.
4,Good experience so far,"Own the printer for about a year now; I drive it with Windows 2K Server sharing it to my home network; Works very nice;A little slow to print pictures at high quality (as expected), but does a very good job. Only Thing I don't like (and that's why I don't give it 5 stars) is that there's not a manual-load tray, or input slot; I miss that when I want to print just a page in some sort of different paper or letterhead; You got to load the paper in the only tray there is and it is a little cumbersome when you try to load just one page or two.Besides that, it is vey snappy, and love all the duplexing features it has, like copying from two-to-two one-to-two, and other combinations.Faxing is very sharp (receiving and sending), the software is adequate; I recommend it to run it in a powerful machine (it could be slow on old processors)I think I got my money's worth."
5,Works Fine for Me,"Well, I just got the printer today. My first multi-function print. It replaced my old Canon BJC3000. I had a minor problem with the lower feed tray not being detected. Took about a minute to fix. Then, after the print head alignment, I put it through the works. Scan, copy (1 and 2 sided), printing (1 and 2 sided), and faxing.Results?Everything went without a hitch. I highly recommend this printer for general home office use.As for the negative reviews, check this printer out for yourself. You can go to almost any computer/office/electronics store and ask them to give a demonstration of it's capabilities."
1,Lots of Problems,"This printer doesn't print consistently with my Windows XP laptop. It fails to print on most documents because of connection problems with the laptop. I am using it with a new Compaq 2800T running Windows XP Professional. All of the software is standard and updated. HP support has been very poor with suggestions like plug the printer directly into the wall. When it prints, the printer is noisy, uses a lot of ink, and has only average print quality. It also seems to be constructed of cheap parts."
4,introducing art and classical music,"I was worried that this DVD would be rejected out of hand by one of the two children to whom we gave it. My worry was for naught. The very active, just turned two years old child actually watched it and became fascinated by Miro shapes and the frog conductor. Now it is requested during play time, providing music, art and information amidst the clatter of toys. Even now, questions come up about the music and art, even when I think the child is not watching. Soon we will go to a real art museum!"
2,The worst handbook to date!,"I am sorry for all of you that believe this book was the best one of the series. I am afraid to say it, but TSR really struggled when trying to make this. The kits were weak. They lacked reason for playing. Unlike the other books, this one did an extremely poor job with kits. It merely described the role and description of them. Whereas the other books added to the suggested proficiencies and special benefits and hindrances. That is what many people are looking for when buying handbooks. It is easy to decide to play an acrobatic thief, but it is difficult to determine benefits and hindrances. Perhaps they could have added something to the extent of acrobat thieves, being members of a traveling circus. Having the benefits of wealth and contacts, but the hindrance of always travelling. However, I did have to give the book two stars for its section on guilds."
5,One of the finest guide books in the world!,"If it is a single thief you want, or a whole thieves guild, this is the ONLY book you need! The character subclasses such as cutpurse give such a depth into the game. I have used this to develope a guide run city, with 150+ guide members, from all of the subclasses listed in the book. It gives such depth! As a thief user myself it is now indispensible. Even the new item lists are superb! Get it if you use thieves at all!!!"
4,"Great game, variable quality miniatures","The D&D miniatures game is a lot of fun to play-- all the excitement of a simplified D&D without any prep time. You will need to buy at least one ""Entry Pack"" to play. This expansion pack just gives you more miniatures. It takes a few expansion packs (~4) to really have a good set to choose from. Commanders, a fairly important type of piece are a little too rare for my tastes.The miniatures themselves are so-so. I understand they have to be plastic to make the product affordable, but that was tough for this ""real"" miniature-lover to accept. They must truly be hand-painted, because the paint jobs on similar pieces varies quite a bit.If you want quality miniatures, buy metal (no longer lead) and paint them yourself. If you want a fun new D&D product, or aren't picky about your miniatures, then this is for you."
2,Did not care for this book,"This book had way too much religious references for me.I read it in about an hour, because I had to skip through so much."
4,Bike Mirror,Nice flat mirror. Very light. Doesn't take up a lot of space on my bike and I can see behind me just fine.
2,Not that good,This is not that good of a mirror and the arm adjustment is weak and wants to return to its original position. Also it is a curved mirror so you don't get a good perspective of how far a car is behind you and at night very difficult top see what is coming up on you. Suggest a flat mirror.
5,para los amantes de la musica mexicana- excelente,"jose alfredo jimenez ha sido uno de los mayores cantautores de latinoamerica. Esta seleccion asi lo demuestra. La seleccion es muy buen,al igual que el sonido. La presentacion deja que desear, pero considerando el precio de venta es un verdadero regalo de buena musica. recomendado altamente ( yo lo oigo a menudo)"
1,SUP-USB USB Adapter,"Product: SUP-USB USB MP3 USB charger. AC to USB and 12V (car) to USB.The 12V (car) to USB did not work. Upon inspection, fuse contact was open circuit. Solder quality inside of unit is very poor. Has no output over voltage protection. if the internal 12V to USB (5V) fails, which could happen if the series switch transistor fails short or if the Vout feedback resistor opens or comes unsoldered, the MP3 player would get 12V and could be destroyed. I do not know if this a safty issue because I do not know if MP3 players have any charger input protection. My player uses a lithium battery and a lithium battery can be dangerous if not charged with in their ratings.My qualifications: Electrical Engineer, designed voltage regulators for over 30 years."
2,Not terrible but...,"I know the device looks good, is well made, and is affordable for the items, but for some reason it does not work with a Zen Vision M . Sure the device seems to hook up, but it does not administer a charge! Also, there is no real instruction or information on what the adapter is capable to work with; basically the description of the device and compatibility is not good. Thats why it gets a 2."
2,Very little substance,"Several portraits of the Kobal collection are presented along with a brief guess as to how each was made, based solely on visual clues within the photograph. Photographers will probably be disappointed in the lack of useful technical data. The lighting diagrams are very vague, even so, some are obviously wrong. If the authors had bothered to recreate the photographs, they might have noticed the errors. However, they seemed satisfied with filling in blank spaces with biographical information about the actors. This seems like a very easy book for the authors to produce."
3,It leaves a lot to think about..,"The Turn of the Screw leaves a lot of questions unanswered. It is the story of a governess who is haunted by her predecessor and her [the former governess's] lover.. or at least thinks she is. She determines that the two ghosts are there for the children. Henry James never tells us straight out whether the governess is slowly going crazy, or if all that happens is true. There are hints at both situations.Henry James uses the language very well. However, there are some references to art and literature that are interesting, but may not be immediately recognized. If you think they might interest you, I'd suggest getting an annotated edition.If you are considering picking this book up for a scare, this might not satisfy you. If you want a thought-provoking, psychological novella, this is for you."
3,Difficult to read,"Good story, but hard to read given the older style of writing - lots of long, long sentences with sub-themes within each sentence. Had to read some lines several times before understanding the point. The story line is good but a bit confusing, probably because it's not a modern story. I didn't understand why the children were being 'haunted' or even if they truly were. I think it would be a good book to study in a classroom, but not so much for reading enjoyment."
2,Dry Ghost Story,"I found this text to be rather bad. Although the plot may have some highlights, James'literary technique is dry to say the least. It seems as if he attempts to copy Hawthorne's style and if that's what he is doing, he's doing a bad job of it."
3,A Solid Anthology.,"A fairly good compilation of 30 years of the best band in the Salsa music world. The sound is not as potent (technical criticism) as it should be, and the selections did not include some of their most popular hits. All and all a solid addition to a serious Salsa fan's music library.Sincerely,World's biggest Cocolo"
1,Blueprint Reading for Electricians,"I am totally disappointed in this book. It would be alot easier to do a Goggle search of electrician symbols than to try and use this book. It is suppose to be for electricians but it lacks any foundation for the electrician. The main reason I dislike this book, it has no substance just electricial symbols, no explanations, no discussion of what the electrician needs to focus on, and the worst part, the graphics are small and not well done at all. Full of useless information, for example, I want to learn about electrical blueprints so they had to include door schedules,etc.etc. just fill material to sell a book."
2,what?,"okay, the movie was good. we all know that. let's talk about the soundtrack. my friend bought it and i listened to it and hated it.there isn't a single recognizable song or band on there. i heard SR-71's ""right now"" which is a good song but isn't on the soundtrack. ""I'm afraid of britanny spears""? What?? these bands have no talent and should be punished for the music they make. none even make sense.i like all kinds of music, and the people on here stink. my friend threw out the CD after we listened to it."
2,Excellent movie...but the soundtrack is lacking!,"...if you don't mind me asking: ""Dude, where's the good music from this awesome movie?, cuz it sure ain't on the lame soundtrack!!"" As hip as it tries to be, the soundtrack just lags. Superdrag rocks hard (as always), but groups like Ween and others drag this thing down - bigtime!If there is a sequel to this movie (God willing), I only hope they can bring together better bands for the accompanying soundtrack. Perhaps like the Austin Powers dynasty, this movie will attract better bands willing to lend their name to such a highly esteemed project..."
2,No Dude,"The movie was okay, but whats with the soundtrack? It's terrible! The bands on it are no-names, which will definately never make it in the real music business. The songs are crappy and badly named (I'm afraid of Britney Spears?). I though this CD would have SR-71's ""Right Now"", but it doesn't (and that's a good and hilarious song). Stick with the movie and forget the soundtrack."
5,Pretty Sweet Soundtrack,"I really enjoyed this soundtrack. To the person who bought this CD and it didnt have Sprung Monkey, I dont know where you bought it at. My copy does actually have Sprung Monkey on it. However, my CD is missing Treble Charger - American Psycho, which is slightly a disappointment, but it doesnt matter to me. This CD is excellent, and I recommend it to anybody who saw the movie or likes punk music."
4,Not bad!,"I was kinda leery about this game after reading the reviews here on amazon, but i got it used locally and was really surprised. It kinda feels like a simplified verrsion of PS2s Naval Ops:Commander. It does feel more old school on an advanced platform like the PSP. But said and done I would recommend this game, especially if you have a lot of time to kill!"
2,This show was once good but is now pretty much unwatchable,"With each subsequent season, this show has gotten worse. A great premise squandered by writers who don't seem to know what direction they want to go.This season they got rid of some really good characters and added new ones that didn't click. They aged Isabelle which was a big mistake not only because the actress was horrible but the character too. They got rid of Lily and Kyle (for a majority of the season anyway) and everything went even more downhill after that. Add to this that they also increased Shawn's part which brought nothing to the story or show. Who cares anymore? I don't.I kept waiting for something good to happen and it never did. So, this is where I check out. No Season 4 for me.Best thing is Joel Gretsch who lights up every scene he is in."
4,Set in stone,"Season three was very good - though it made the writers theory set in stone (as in they are from the future, religious twist, etc)...The first two were based more on ones perception on how the events unfolded, but the third was pretty clear where the writers were coming from.It was a very intereseting season, and I am anxious for season 4.-Jwbajorek"
4,4400- Third Season,"Some new characters and changes occur in this season. If you were hooked on the first two seasons, you simply must catch up with the Third Season of the 4400.Cinematically, this show is very pleasing to watch and I love the performances of Jac. McKenzie and Patrick Flueger.A top show, 10/10 for this season."
4,A decent book if without typo,"I have passed the exam and wholy depend on the ""book for suckers"". my score 916. i read that book cover to cover three times in 14 days. that is the only thing i have for preparing the exam. if you know access a little bit and just want a book for exam. this one is a good choice. sure, there are a hell lot of typos, but most are apparent and you know what the poor author is tring to say. the author, although not a mcsd, really know a lot about 70-69."
2,"Better than nothing, just...","Before I read these reviews I sent a email to New Riders describing the problems I had with the CD and asking if there were any bug fixes. They told me they had never heard of the problem, to try the cd on another machine and that the book was no longer covered by their support agreement anyway. The exam is still valid, so why isn't the book? Luckily I have used Access for a long time and could spot the errors, but a beginner is likely to get very confused. Use with caution."
1,Error upon error,"In the bookshop this book looked like it covered everything, good CD, lots of examples. BUT there are so many errors you can't believe everything you read and that's not what you want from a certification book. New Riders should get there act together, this won't do!!!!!!! Don't waste your money"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I agree with the previous poster. This book is a frustrating, aggravating experience. The text is full of typo's, the examples are wrong, the questions have wrong answer's..... Save your money! WIsh I could get a refund"
3,Good preparation -- if you are a VB and Access veteran,It seems this book is geared towards the Access beginner rather than someone who is ready to take the exam. This book is too detailed. The exam concepts could have been covered in half the length. Those who have used Access for a while can filter out the extraneous information. Get this book only if you know Access and VB really well and just need to reinforce key concpets. If you're a beginner this book will not prepare you for the exam.
2,Fair to Poor,"I just passed my test today and this book did help more than it hindered. The problems are several fold. First, they emphasized the wrong materials and second, some of the information is wrong. I was also unhappy about the test exam. It gave me an error when ever it corrected the test. It also had the same question four or five times in the test. It also did not know how to score correctly. Overall, the book is a method of studing. It is the only book available. Use it but do not depend on it heavily."
3,Breaks 2 of UNDEAD Film Rules !,"Pretty amazing film with a clever bending of traditional rules for UNDEAD films.As recently as ZOMBIELAND,They hinted at what one needed to do to survive.Not once did they mention that the zombies could outrun you.Zombies may fire back or worse have a weapon that is loaded and you wont.This brings up more questions than Zombieland did, And yet takes you on this journey of who do you trust or Who isnt going to eat you.The only characters we cared about was the hitman and his wacko model of a girlfriend."
3,A very nice piece of equipment,"I purchased this mp3 player based on looks and reviews. Once I received it, I found it to be a sturdy, solidly constructed and attractive item. Then the difficulty began. I think, since I am a novice, that this device might be suitable for someone who knows what they are doing, but I found the instructions (which I found online) for loading music, books and videos to be very frustrating. I ended up returning the player due to no apparent fault with the player, but with my difficulty understanding the instructions."
3,Forty -Six Years in the Army,Not a bad book does tend to be a little repetitive in some parts .But gives a fairly good picture of the times .
5,Better than I remember!,"I always loved Joan Baez as I young person! She was one of my heroes in the folk era. I saw this piece on PBS a little while ago, and I was so moved that I had to have it for myself. Such courage and beauty in this artist and activist and also in those she built the movement with! I am grateful for them and all we owe to them!San Rogers, Hagerstown, Md."
4,Sesame Street: The Best of Elmo 2,"I purchased this product for my 3 years old grandson. He is enjoying it very much and keep asking for replay. I recommend this dvd for any kid,it will keep them ""busy"" for 45 minutes."
2,Unfortunately muddled account...,"Interesting subject: an insider's look at what it was to be a member of the Hitler Youth. Unfortunately, this short autobiography becomes too quickly muddled and difficult to follow, leaving the reader apathetic to the real drama and heartbreak of the story's reality. I suspect this has something to do with the translation to English...the author's account obviously deserves a better treatment than it's getting here. A much larger, but more gripping novel, is HITLER's LAST COURIER which tells of a boy drafted into military service at the end of the war."
3,"warning, a dog gets beaten and dies in this film",this is NOT for young children. it is very dark. it is quite sad. it might be hard for them to understand the plot lines. a dog gets beaten and dies.
5,Buena Coleccion,"Yo compre este disco en 1994 y suena bastante bien. Aunque el disco del 20mo aniversario contiene temas mas memorables, tiene muy poco volumen. Digno de comprar"
1,Not so much.,"Well, I did my research before ordering - I weighed the good and bad reviews. Now I know why some reviewers wrote - it's like trying to scrape your tongue with a teaspoon. That is exactly what this is like. My original 'The Tongue Cleaner' plastic cleaner is far superior to this one. For the price of this stainless steel model, it should at least clean a little."
5,Very effective Tongue cleaner,This Tongue Cleaner is very effective and does a thorough job. It is easy to use and durable. I am satisfied with the product and will use it regularly for a long time.
5,Awesome for my 5 yr old.,Love this. My 5 yr old loves to pretend search his dad for change in his pockets. Fun little toy. Pretty sturdy too.
3,Seems fake,"My son was really excited about this but it seems that it isn't accurate. Sometime an item sets it off, sometimes it doesn't. Also, if you crank the knob up everything sets it off."
5,"wonderful, romantic","Jorge Negrete was the most sexiest man around back in the early fifties, and soromantic too. He knew exactly how to treat a woman, he was such a gentleman and handsome too, I was only a child then, but I remember all the women going crazy over him. I used to wonder why, but after I see the men of today I feel sad. It was very nice to look up to your man. I understand that some women had something to do with it. But do the rest of us have to pay for it.?"
3,"Kinda disappoinitng, but has some good qualities.","This game is average. It is all about being a dinosaur hunter and trying to get dangerous dinosaurs for trophies. Despite hating real life hunters and being a nature lover, I still must say, since the weapons and dinos were cool and it was all fake, this game did have a couple of pluses. It is all right, and if you can't find anything to do whatsoever, it's probably worth a shot playing this. However, it gets three stars only because there are just a few too many bad spots for it to be in my top games. I don't have it anymore, and do not plan to buy it again, but at least it was okay while it lasted."
4,Dropped on Jurasic Park......... Cool.,"I got this game, because I was over my Mom's house for the holidays. I figured there was going to be some down-time, and she had a PC with NO games. This was great for going in and taking down some small Dinosaurs for a quick fix. Then (after getting my Stepdad, and brother hooked), we would go on a much more aggressive hunt, like after Raptors. Watch the wind. Other animals are on the island, and not all of them are plant eaters. Everything moved smooth, and you can choose how dense you want the foliage, and how sensitive you want the animals to sight, sound, and smell. I wish the directions were more then just a few pages, though. I never got to the BIG carnivores, but it seemed that there should be more interaction with the dinosaurs amongst themselves. (i.e.. getting eaten and all that). All and all a very fun game."
3,The Story of Ruth,"Reasonable Biblical drama. Story does not adhere too well to the real Bible story as there is not that much known about Ruth. However, the film is fairly entertaining and interesting."
3,One line ruined the whole movie,this was a good until a prophet told Naomi that from Ruth would come a PROPHET that SOME would worship as the Messiah. This basically said that Jesus was a Prophet not the son of God and that some would just believe that he was the Messiah.
3,"To much Hollywood, not enough Bible","This account of the life of Ruth is entertaining, but lacks biblical correctness, the Director interjected to many ""Hollywood glamour"" scenes and left out to much biblical truth. Someone grounded in the Bible can easily pick out the false parts, but I would'nt show it to a young christian without explanation of the differences, so they dont take entertainment for truth."
2,Ruth: The Figment of Someone's Imagination,The Bible narrative of Ruth is truly beautiful. This contraption was ridiculous in so many ways. Why is it necessary to add to an already beautiful and true story? The additions did not in any way improve the true story. I wish I had not watched it because it was truly tedious in many places.
2,story of ruth,story did not follow biblical book of ruth in content and thought it was very artifical in content and acting.
5,great story telling,fantastic story of ruth. very well told without lots of special effects. they just don't make movies this well anymore.
1,A blow to the tummy.,"Why? Why? Dogmatic God's word is wrong. God said if you add or subtract My words, you lose. Get it?"
5,A Great Book on the Iranian Left,This might be the first book on the history of Iranian leftist parties and organizations in Iran. It is well-written and informative. It is not an anti-left book neither it tries to oppose any political group. It is just a history of what happened to the left in the 20th century in Iran.Many people in the left didn't like it because for the first time somebody gave them a mirror to look at their own face.
4,KJV read on CD (Audio),"This is the New Testament of the KJV (I cannot recommend anything better) in audio on multiple CDs. The 16 CDs are laid conveniently so that chapters tend to match tracks. The case nicely holds all CDs.The reading is clear, but lacks the impact of other versions I own on cassette.Have A Blessed Day!"
2,Looked nice but was delivered broken,Packaging not sufficient to protect it from travelling - the glass fells into pieces as I took it gently out of the box.
2,"Correct length, connector too flemsy",I used this product from my external drive to my computer to hold my music. One little jiggle moves the connector and caused me to lose 7700 of my songs. Not real happy.
5,Great Theory and Practice,This is an excellent presention of EFT for couple therapy. The theoretical underpinnings are presented in a way that does not detract from the aim of the book to help one learn how this work is done. There are lots of clear examples and explanations that give one the feeling they are ready to apply what they have learned in their next session. Written in a clear style free of jargon.
4,An excellent overview of the subject,"This is book is an excellent overview of the subject. That said, most of the book is dedicated to the major figures (Coltrane, Davis, Coleman, Sun Ra, Mingus, etc.) and there are other books available dedicated to these subjects with more detail. But if you haven't read the critical biographies on the major figures, this is a good place to start to learn about jazz during 1958-1975, and there are interesting sections on some less well known musicians who you can't read about anywhere else."
5,Woo wee!,This a great video (if you nothing else to do or you finished this months mad mag)then watch this!!!
1,"Terrible, not funny at all","There is really nothing to say about it. Al is terrible and making mockery of music. If he wants to make funny songs, then let him think of his own stuff and not just copy someone else."
2,Not the best,"I have read many of Katherine Paterson's works but this book is by far the worse of her works. We had to read it in my English class.I believe that there were to many Japanese names that were hard to pronounce. The ending disgusted every one of my classmates, including me. The plot was okay, but Takiko is too selfish, even when she is almost a woman. Don't waste your time; this book is not worth reading."
3,Wow!,"""I give 'Of Nightingales That Weep"" a three star review. I liked it but I didn't like all of the battles and the romance. I think Katherine Patterson could have cut out some of the gushy love stuff."""
5,Adult transformation to truth and love,"This is not a story for children, but a story of maturation for adults. Who isn't selfish as a child? But life has a way of teaching that true beauty is different from perfection, that life is complicated, and to find love one must look at reality rather than fantasy. What we think we know as a child is not the truth we discover during a life of suffering.I read this story as a 50 yr.+ woman and consider it to be one of the most truthful beautiful stories I have ever read."
5,Excellent - as always,Excellent through and through! I just hope the movie (which I hear they are working on) will come out soon and be available in the US ASAP!
5,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS - ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS,20 years after the series first aired it was good to see what this bunch of crazies were up to and they did not disappoint in these 3 episode - Edwina and Patsy are as narcisistic as every Safron is still uptight - Bubbles is still an idiot and Mrs. Moonsoon is still amazing with her one line zingers. Even the Olympics is not spared the indignity of Patsy and Edwina's antics - I loved every moment of this and would recommend it as a must have
1,disappointed,This is the first time we were diappointed in this series...It just didn't seem up to the caliber of the previous episodes.
5,"so glad to see the girls, we are girls...back together",I adore this program. It is fun to indulge in the lifestyle of the selfish that these women provide. i am thrilled that the anniversary is upon us but WHERE IS EPISODE 3! please please let us see it!
5,AbFab in HD!,3 episodes in HD at a great price. just as funny as ever. they could make this show go on forever and this gay man would be very happy.
5,Marathon Challenge,"If you're a runner, you MUST get/watch this movie! Fantastic gift for runners and runner-wannabe's."
1,????QUESTION????,"Did this training program really get these individuals into such great condition that they actually QUALIFIED for, and then RAN the Boston Marathon? Or did did they simply run Boston as ""Bandits?"" I find it difficult to believe these formerly sedentary people took up running and were able to qualify for the Boston Marathon--the Crown Jewel of all marathons--in only nine months. If they did, hell, sign me up; I've run dozens of marathons and have been trying to qualify for Boston for several years!"
4,haunting,"it's rare that I want to watch a movie twice in one sitting. After I finished watching After-Life the first time, I immediately rewound it to watch it again. It captures so many poignant moments of life and the fragility as well as the strength that memories are made of. While there was a fair amount of talking in the film, I found that the main characters of Takashi and Shiori in particular expressed volumes through their silences and faces."
1,A slow cooker for your dog!,"I bought this for my chihuahua to give him a warm place to lay in the winter. Once a pillow got pushed on top of it in his kennel and it overheated, causing the house to fill with fumes of melting plastic. I was awoken to his cries from the kennel. There is no thermostat so it just puts out the same heat no matter how insulated it gets, creating a dangerous condition. Mine is now melted and sitting in the trash can. Waste of money and natural resources."
2,Disapointed,"I am disappointed in this product. First it is made of a very stiff (read nearly inflexible) material. By itself it is not going to be very cushy or comfortable for a dogs elbows. It is so stiff that I feel you must have some cushion on top of it for a dogs comfort. Unfortunately ans the other person mentioned, the pad does not get very warm and adding a couple of inches of cushion above it makes it about useless.The description included that it is ""machine washable."" Not sure how they can state this.If you want a pad that both cushions and warms your dog, I don't feel you will be happy with this item."
3,Not as warm as I thought it'd be,"The cover was a piece of crap. After about three days of them laying on it, it was all matted down and there was no fuzz left on it. And it only affixes with little elastic strips on each corner. It got stretched out really quick and so I threw it out after about a week.The plastic is kind of hard, but they still,lay on it. It would be nice if they had a cover that went with it that was worth something. It says it heats up to 102 degrees but I highly doubt that. I'd say 60-70 about. I wouldn't use this as their only source of warmth Ina colder climate. Luckily it works great in AZ."
5,Great for mild winters.,"I have used this product for my dog all winter. He is an outside dog and the mat was put into the back of his dog house. He has loved it. It has been great with cedar down to about 20 degrees on a regular night time basis. Of course, he would not tell me otherwise...since he can't talk. He does seem to be happy with it!"
1,Kennel Heating Pad,Product says that it is indestructable but that is very untrue. My dog tore this pad up within 2 days. Returned product not good.
1,"bought two, both broke","I got two of these for my dog (one inside, one outside on her chase lounge, covered). She's 75lbs, so I got the large. Both of them broke - the little round ""supports"" broke through the top, revealing metal coils which are obviously dangerous to the dog. Both just stopped working. Unfortunately, both were past warranty, and who could afford return shipping anyway?And the fleece cover is a joke. The ""pads"" are hard plastic, and the fleece is just too thin to make a difference. Plus the fleece cover has flimsy straps that just break off."
2,Why this only rates 2 stars.,"This is a great book of one of the greatest jazz musicians ever to live and pioneered jazz. However, the two stars is for the absolutely ridiculous price on this product as you can find it on other websites for under $20. So before getting excited and committing to this book, look around else where."
4,Good enough.,"Works well for the price. Can be difficult when it's windy, but to be expected for the material the numbers are printed on. I have used it a couple times with no outright complaints!"
5,All I can say,"I came across this album through ebay after listening to it, i realised that DCB has been around for a long time. His song and approach were simple and pure. I love them musically cause the lyrics is loud and clear. Dave sang with true devotion and heart unto the Lord and we need to restore such worship in the Church. Thanks Dave, may the Lord use you mightily ."
5,Outstanding Series,The classical baby series is by far the best I have found. My two year old has been loving these for the past year. They are very relaxing and are our go-to videos when getting ready for bed.
4,"cute, but...","I remember the Gus books from when I was young, and wanted to try them with my kids (3 & 6). The illustrations are nice and soft, the story is cute, but I didn't like that mouse said ""Shut up!"" to Mr. Frizzle (we don't disrespect each other with these words in our family). My youngest asked where the baby ghost's mommy was (i can understand her thinking, ""what in the world, a baby without a mommy?"") There's a bit more yelling at each other than I prefer as Gus tries to work out the dynamics of the new ""family"" with Mr. Frizzle (not such a good example of calm problem-solving, which i think young kids need) But it's an older book, and I see the same thing in other vintage books we've tried. At least the cat Cora knew what to do, and they work it out in the end. Still worth checking out, the illustrations are really cute. Just wanted to warn those who might be sensitive to the same things."
4,Amusing and Interesting,"Speculating on market expectations? Certainly! Speculators and Investors alike are trying to estimate, as they did in the past, the discount factor that markets are applying to his latest speech. Good companion to Beckner's ""Back from the Brink: The Greenspan Years"" hence write the same I did for that book. We always watch the yield curve and try to unsuccesfully predict how changes in its slope might affect market expectations. Knowing about the person who indirectly draws it makes a lot of sense. Undoubtly, Alan Greenspan will be remembered for many years to come as one of the greatest economic minds of this century. Highly recommended. Easy read."
5,If you can afford it go for it.,"At a time that you can easiy find external disks at less than a dollar per GB this drive costs near $3 dollars per GB. I still think it is worth for wath you get in terms of speed, reliability and portability. I use it all the time and love it."
1,Move Along...,"This is a translation that was doomed from the start. Since it is impossible to translate the rhyme scheme and meter of the poem into English; we must simply be content with a true translation, or learn Italian. Ciardi makes a valiant attempt, but it is futile. In fact he makes a fairly straightforward text almost impossible to understand. He also savages the text in order to fit the words into the meter and rhyme. Although in some ways I prefer this to the cleaner translations (since it DOES have the true feel of Dante about it), I am afraid I cannot recommend it; especially not to a beginner. Stick with Allen Mandelbaum (though Ciardi's glosses are more comprehensive and elaborate)"
1,Disappointing,"We ordered this specifically because it said Mac compatible. Nope, wouldn't open at all. What a waste of $. And my college aged kids were loading it so it isn't a matter if not being tech savvy"
2,Really Disappointing,"Take my advice: stick to the First series ""Cranford""...don't bother buying this...I was so disappointed. The story line barely follows the first ""Cranford"" and there are so many new added people that it just doesn't make any sense at all. I wish I had not wasted my money on this one. The first ""Cranford"" was so very good and the story was wonderful...so I was really pumped to see the sequel. But in the first 5 minutes of watching ""Return to Cranford""...I thought ""Uh-Oh"" and I was right. I normally love the BBC stuff but this one just stinks. Not good at all."
3,Good Show but lacking,This season is not as good as the first. I felt they had added corny actors that were just supid not funny. I loved the first season but this one was not up to the standards they set.
5,WHAT A LOVELY CHRISTMAS!,"Return to Cranford is an ideal Christmas with friends and loved ones. Judi Dench gives such a heart-warming performance, you wish you were there with them. I am going to add it to my 'must-see' Christmas Movies during the Holidays!I appreciate Amazon's including these genre of movies, they brighten my day!"
1,WORTHLESS,This is a worthless piece of book. Nothing with Literary Criticism. Save your money.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. WORTHLESS. Waste of money!
5,"A ""must-have"" book on the civil rights movement.","This is an excellent book that provides a unique perspective on the civil rights movement. The author does an excellent job of compiling interviews not only from important leaders of that era, but also from the common man/woman/child you rearely hear from. This a unique perspective not often found."
2,mediocre fare with a few good points,"There are a few good points to this one. The space ship designs are interesting. Some of the scenes involving them are impressively animated. Overall however, this is a poor product. It has the feel of a much longer story chopped to fit onto two tapes. There are huge gaps in the story. Characters are introduced with no rythme or reason. The action jumps from place to place erratically. Sometimes the story becomes almost incoherent. It has all the standard earmarks of indiscriminately hacked anime. I would reccomend you rent this one before considering buying it. A major video rental chain with the initials BBV carries it."
3,"A forerunner of what was to come, but not up to par now.","In 1965 it was about all that was, but today we have many more choices to choose from. Perhaps if you are a genius you may still think this the best thing under the sun , but I am not quite there.The ""advance calcuus"" field has a ton of them now is what i am saying. And so does ""smooth manifolds"" theory. When I had ""Calculus on Smooth Manifolds"" by Spivak as the textbook from which I was learning, all this was obvious. That was a better middle ground between the two, even though it was inadequate in application examples."
5,Time Flyer,"I watched this movie when I was a kid only once but impacted me so much that I never forgot it and to this day I have never been able to find it until now, I thought I was imagining it. Every time I search anywhere under ""time travel"" this one has never come up. Disney made a LOT of really great movies that were on tv when I was growing up that you just can't find any more. I don't know what they are doing with them now, or if they are just forgotten completely in a storeroom??? I would buy this but I can't get myself to spend so much when I don't know if I will even like it now as an adult. If it were $10 or $12 I would buy it for SURE."
3,COOL,"DVD is cool. Rob is an amazing singer, great voice, a little bit shy but very passionate artist. He easily delivers his talent. DVD sound is good, acceptable production."
5,Encore!,"I also bought ""A Night in the Life of Matchbox 20"". I viewed it first, which elevated my respect for Rob Thomas. I then popped in this DVD and was blown away by an even more inspired performance. After these two videos, I'm going to head to a live concert if the opportunity arises."
2,Disappointed,"The concert, captured as a Soundstage production, exhibits the expected video and sound quality from the bluray disk. No complaints there. I just didn't like it. Not nearly as good as the Matchbox Twenty Soundstage concert I have seen on cable. Rob looks old and pale and I'm just not impressed with the songs presented. I'm not really a big fan of Rob's solo work as much as his Matchbox Twenty stuff, but he does some of both. The best song on the disk is a David Bowie cover. I doubt I will watch it again, whereas the Matchbox Twenty show I have watched many times on my DVR and still enjoy that immensely."
4,Well received,"It was a gift to my mom, who lives in Arizona. Was great to buy online and have shipped to her directly. She loves it!"
5,La esencia del arte!!!,"Disco imprescindible para entender el por que de los 40 años de carrera de esta artista irrepetible.El CD es una maravilla de concierto en vivo en el Auditorio Nacional de Mexico D.F. 1992.El repertorio nos ofrece sencillamente lo mejor de su arte de su grandisima voz y de sus canciones...La gata bajo la lluvia,La diferencia(impresionante en vivo!!!)Amor eterno,duos con Juan Gabriel y Enrique Guzman y dos temas de estudio.GENIAL ROCIO DURCAL Y SU DIRECTO!!!"
3,"Cheap, but not without benefits.","To be clear, I didn't order these specific ones off amazon. I did however purcahse them from home depot. They are very cheap, and therefore dent easily, break quickly and don't lock very tight. I mainly use them to cheap lighting. They cost next to nothing, so you don't have to worry about them. Just don't expect much."
5,Proud Primer,"This is an excellent book that works you through step by step. I actually lost this book and had to reorder another one, I wouldn't think of ordering a different book."
4,Very Helpful.,"I have never played the mandolin or any stringed instrument before, but I feel like I'm learning quite a bit through the use of this book. The Bert Casey video makes it easier to see how to place your fingers so you should get that as well as the book/CD."
5,Excellent Beginner's Book,"This is an excellent first book for aspiring mandolin players. It doesn't assume or require any preexisting knowledge of the instrument or musical notation since, as pointed out by a prior reviewer, it provides visual scores or tablature of finger placement. The book also provides very helpful practical tips on such things as tuning, recommending, for example, the purchase of an inexpensive electronic tuner. I followed that advice and bought a Korg CA-30 and used it not only to successfully tune the mandolin but also my guitar which I had for years previously tuned ""by ear"" with varying degrees of success. Mr. Casey is also straight-forward in making it clear that learning the Mandolin takes a lot of practice and, at least until you develop some callouses on your finger tips, sometime painful practice. However, if you are diligent in following his lesson plans, you will learn to play the mandolin to an extent that will amaze not only your friends but yourself."
3,More emphasis on chords would be good...,This book is geared toward the beginner who plans to make the mandolin their primary instrument. There is a great deal of instruction on basic scales and fretting. I'm a guitar player of 30 some odd years...I was kind of looking for something that would touch on the basics AND have details on chording so I could get up and running quickly. Only the last three pages cover chording. Good otherwise.
3,I love Spenser,this book was better than some of his later books---I was getting disappointed with the story and dialog-----it seemed to be lacking some of the earlier ZIP
2,The Map of Love,"This book is a peculiar combination of bodice-ripping romance novel and historical fiction. The romance novel aspects are, as one would imagine, ridiculous and unbelievable. It was, however, interesting to read the political subplot toward the end of the novel to learn about Egyptians' responses to British (and, later, American) angling in the area. I'm hoping there are better novels out there that deal more meaningfully with these issues."
5,Following the Map,"The key to enjoying The Map of Love is to read it slowly, savoring every highway and side road. Ahdaf Soueif - by presenting a plot that swings back and forth in time - forces the reader to contemplate carefully how relations between the West and Middle East have evolved. Or has there been any evoluton at all?The women characters come across as the dominant figures, though sometimes dealing with events from somewhat secluded positions. Anna's character is especially intriguing, and her journals reveal her passion and dedication. The love stories engage our hearts while the political issues stimulate our minds. The author cleverly informs us about the history and issues of a part of the world we need to understand and appreciate better.I enjoyed this book even more on a second reading. To help follow he map: Photocopy the family tree and the glossary, and keep these pags handy for reference throughout."
3,winter cheese,"This collection of high energy cheese is at moments thrilling ,at other times repetitive and irritating.Superb production onthe Gloria Estefan album ""Gloria ""wasthe impetus for me buying this Tony Moran mix . Kunte Latino,Music all over the world,Casa Forte and excellent rework of Lighthouse Family make the C.D rise above schlock.When the money's gone , and some of the sequencing on the second disc had me reaching for my Tony Humphries C.D s and wondering whether my money could not have been better spent elsewhere."
5,More of the Same But Easier,"If you love Viewtiful Joe, then you must get this. It is definitely something a fan must have, but it is also easier than the original game, which some could consider a good thing. The bosses are easier and you are able to have as many as 9 Take 2's at a time if you can afford to buy them, making this game very simple and no challenge to those who thought the first was easy. The story is also involving and keeps fans glued to the TV as new characters are introduced and a few old characters return to make this a sweet game. The gameplay and story is fun, so what are you waiting for? Go get it! You don't have to buy the firt game before you play this, but it makes the story and gameplay all the better if you understand the plot of the previous game."
1,Short version,"Be aware, this version has a run time of 115 minutes. The full version is 242 minutes and the cut video version is 150 minutes. I can't see the logic behind this considering this is a DVD."
1,What a bore!!!!!!!!,This book is a drag!I think the author needs to learn how to write a interesting book.This book stunk!
1,Disappointing,"Very poor quality, poorly built pump. The handle is thin and not ergonomic. The tube is very short. Saw much better air pumps at discount department stores for about the same price and they usually include a barometer/pressure gauge that is missing here."
2,flimsy base,"The first time I used this pump, the flip-out base started to break off! It pumps fine for the small tires on my daughter's bike, but I intend to buy a more solid pump for my own bike. Also, I was being cheap and bought this knowing that it was for Schrader valves and thought I would buy an adapter, but now I'm going to spend a little more and get the pump I need."
5,Jean Shepard is #1 Grand Lady,"I have been a Jean Shepard Fan since 1961 after I saw her and her late husband, Hawkshaw Hawkins, appear on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. I have had the previledge to speak with Jean on the telephone and I can tell you she is what she is, there is no pretense on her part, to be something she is not. I have never meet Jean, in person, but hope to soon. Jean has carried on the tradition of ""real"" country music and with this box set it shows her devotion to the music. Jean's new CD, Tennesse Waltz, is really great too, with a lot of good country music which proves why she is the #1 Grand Lady. From her #1 Fan."
2,Wait for the full first season,"Around mid-June, the entire 13-episode first season of Monk will be included on DVD for about $40 (pretty reasonable, comparatively speaking). Unless you really need a Monk DVD fix right now, just wait a couple months for the whole enchilada."
3,A side of Black life - but not all black life.,"I readily admit that I am a card carrying member of the Black Bourgeoisie so the characters in this book were a little foreign to me. Terry gives a side of Black life that many people live, but not all Black people live this way. Perhaps my problem with the book is that many people will read this book and believe that all African American men are as unfaithful and as low down as the ones that Terry shows in this book. Has Terry ever met a decent Black man? If so, she sure doesn't write about him."
3,Could have been better,"The book is good. It show a side of real life in the black community. I found myself reading this book and matching the people to real life people I know. I also saw myself in this book, which person I will not saw. Good job Terry!!!!"
2,lacking,"This is the third book of Terry's I've read. I felt there was something lacking from this book, and it seems to me that Terry's stories always end so abruptly. It's as if she's trying to keep her books to a 400-page minimum and is forced to end her stories neatly and quietly, rushing to explain and gloss over how the story ends. As I'm reading, the author explains to the hilt, but yet during her final chapter, everything is just glossed over and/or left hanging. And did I miss something while reading this? What happened with Janelle's pregnancy? The author kept bringing it up, bringing it up, and then: we hear no more of what happened. Did she have it, give it away, abort it...? Maybe I skipped those pages where it was explained. The concept was interesting and from the reviews, I thought this book would be a little humorous and a little more interesting. I was disappointed. There was a lot of rambling and the story really didn't fit together too well."
3,Too Much Dysfunction For Me.,I was not thrilled with this book. Now first let me say that it seems I am not with the norm. Most folks love this book. I say that this is another story about a dysfuctional African American family and I grow tired of this particular subject.Now in reference to Terry McMillian's writing style....well she leaves too many loose ends for me. She doesn't complete the characters. I do see this book as the next hour long drama or movie of the week. I would prefer movie of the week so I would only have to se it one time. Maybe on BET. Maybe that is what she is planning.I read this book as part of a book club. Most of the members in the club gave the book a 3 out of 5 stars. The book did stir up some intense conversation about values and opinions of responsibility and how it relates to sexual abuse.Personally...I cried at the end. I was surprised because I MADE MYSELF finish the book...a struggle to say the least. So I at least related to one character.
5,Just started reading...,"I have just started reading A Day Late & A Dollar Short. I love anything written by Terry McMillan. I have read every book she has written and do not think I will be short changed on this one. So far Viola has caught my undivided attention and I want to keep reading and find out what happens to her and her 4 kids, and Cecil!"
2,"Although entertaining, too much drama for my taste","I have read most of Terry McMillans books, and my favorite so far has been Disappearing Acts..This book lacks so much..Way to much drama for my taste, so much of it I hear everyday just commuting by bus to work....No one particular character appealed to me at all. Maybe next time Terry!"
3,True Insight Into A Black Family,Terry McMillan did an insightful portrayal of black family life. I'm sure most blacks can identify most of the character types in their own or families they know.I did the audio and it was read by people who added an additional dimension to the feel of the key characters of the book. Terry's development of these characters is what makes the book special.The big negative of the book is that Terry violates one of the most basic structures of writing a book. This is that the book rises to a climax and then continues on and on. The finish of the book should have come shortly after the climax.I lost interest and became bored with the book after the climax. This is a pity as the book is wonderfully intriguing up to that point.
5,A day late an a dollar short.,Terry Mcmillan a day late an a dollar short.The author is a nice lady an she looks to be in her late 40's and she made an movie .I belive she made waiting to exhale.The book was good an I like it.It is about a lady an her life and how she is living. An her kid's that are know grown.But there is one thing that is wrong .I recommend this book for the age group of 16 and up because you have to be very mature to understand this book in my point of view.
3,"Very reminiscent of ""Mama""","I liked this book okay. I didn't think it was as good as her other books. I basically read this book and ""Mama"" back-to-back because they were the only Terry McMillan books I hadn't read. The storyline was mostly the same as ""Mama"", which I liked better, and I was disappointed with that, but I did like it some."
4,Pretty good deal.,"It took me just about an hour to to install this mirror. I did need to trim the round plastic tab off and reinstall the oem rubber piece, but otherwise everything works fine.Considering the Honda part is almost 200$, I think this was a pretty good deal."
2,URGH,"my 2yr twins watched them, but i thought i was going to kill myself. annoying, badly made videos. we'll stick to jojo circus (or anything else), so the whole family can enjoy."
5,We love it.,"I've got twin boys - almost 4 years old, and an 8 year old daughter. Sometimes they assume the role of ""their"" character and love repeating the songs or problem-solving discussions. With three of them, it works out pretty well!Wonder Pets is all good - positive, light-hearted, not dumbed-down, and really engaging!"
5,Son's favorite,"My son is not interested in TV except for when the Wonder Pets is on. Though he is not talking yet, he dances, laughs at certain parts (especially with the kangaroo hopping up and down looking for him ma-ma), and shakes his head side to side when when Ming Ming introduces herself....and ming ming too."
3,History for Kids,"It's a good starting point for my 1st grader -- along with ""History Pockets, Native Americans"" & other books, we are enjoying our tour through Native American History."
2,Too much hype for a meager paint job,"Just got my starter pack and was very excited to get my hands on the figures as I've heard they are much better painted than the other ""pre-painted skirmish game."" Unfortunately, when I opened my pack what I got was similar to the rest of you folks....dark half-finished painted miniatures. Very, very, very disappointing! Oh well I'll just use my old painted miniatures instead. The game system as well has nothing new to offer except for the way the figures are activated."
2,a little disappointed,I did not realize until after i recieved the book that it was actually retold by a different author. It just lacked the style in which Alistair Mclean is famous for writting. It just wasn't the same.
4,"Excellent, if one sided.","Mr. Malone's description of Mr. Jefferson is detailed and encompassing. It is well organized and brings the reader in touch with this American Icon and his times. The only failing of this work and its subsequent volumes is that we really only see the best of Mr. Jefferson. His failures, faults and weakeness are dealt with as if they were unimportant or at least only a minor footnote in development of this man. Only in his last volume does Mr. Malone start to deal with the more complex parts of Mr. Jefferson's life. Regardless of this shortcoming this work should be required reading by all students of American History."
5,Essential book on Jefferson,"I enjoyed this book a lot. I agree with the reviewer that said it was one-sided, but I've never read a Jefferson book that wasn't. (Read Joseph Ellis' American Sphinx to get a more critical view). It reads like a narrative, perhaps the only way to understand Jefferson's complex world. One shortcoming of this style is that it doesn't provide analysis, which I usually appreciate. A lot of it is ""just the facts."" But it is a great portrait of Jefferson as he emerges onto the national scene."
4,A Great Work of Scholarship Flawed by Hero-worship,"Dumas Malone's massive biography of Thomas Jefferson remains one of the landmark biographies ever written. As a work of scholarship, it is truely fantastic. Anyone interested in a serious study of Jefferson's life and career has to start here, with Malone. Unfortunatly, the books (6 volumes in all) are diminished by Malone's unvarnished hero worship for his subject. Jefferson cannot fart without Malone apologizing for him and attempting to shift the blame to someone else. (Usually Hamilton) Still, the research and literary merit of this biography is so outstanding, it should not put you off."
4,A great historical account of forgotten American History,This book gives great insight in to the true meaning of African American slaves songs. This book also discusses the origin and uses of the songs and provides footnotes for most of the colloquials and variations in dialect for each song.
1,Don't buy this,"VERY disappointed. It was difficult to read, Delorme always does such a fine job with there maps apparently cities are not there strong suite."
4,Good Stuff,"Sam Bush is great. And he plays with greats. Enough said. If you're even looking at this item you probably know something about him, but if there is any question about whether you should buy this album, just do it."
5,MY THREE-YEAR-OLD ESPECIALLY LOVES THIS BOOK!,"This book features four charming stories about a little boy, Alfie, and his everyday adventures. My 3-year-old especially loves the birthday party story, but also frequently asks for the ""raining in the house"" story, the ""I'm there first"" story and the ""rain boots"" story as well. The illustrations are exceptional, and a treat for a cartoon illustration-weary parent to behold. Every parent will see a little of Alfie in their own child, and appreciate him/her the better for it!"
2,"Very basic, basic stuff",I bought this book as a part of my graduate coursework in telecommunications field. I was truly disappointed with the book and suprised that it is even required for graduate school curriculum. The author in many cases is contradicting herself from one chapter to another. There are a couple of typing errors in the book too. The writing is poor. The information Ms. Laino is sharing with the public is nothing new for the people who have been in the industry for a while. I would recommend it only for the individuals who know absolutely nothing about telecommunications and need vary basic guidelines on how to manage Telecommunications systems and resources.
4,Little Bub's Tale,"If you went to Vermont, back in the time of the late 1700s... you would meet Justin Morgan. He was a man who had a problem. It all started because a farmer owed Justin some money. The farmer couldn't pay the debt, so instead, he gave a horse. To some people, that would be a wonderful thing to receive, but Justin didn't need a horse. He needed money.One might say, ""Sell the horse""--but that's just the problem. No one wants to use their money on a small, (VERY small), scrawny animal, who is weak and cannot work like other horses. Since no one will buy poor Little Bub, Justin is indeed stuck with him.See what can happen that turns this story upside-down when Justin Morgan's friend decides to help out. Why, even President Monroe takes notice!This book tells a true story. I liked the book because while I was reading it, I knew that it actually happened. In fact, Little Bub's tale became an American legend. This is a delightful horse story, great for boys & girls to read (ages 9 and up)."
4,An allegory by Catherine Fisher,An engaging story by Catherine Fisher. A story rich with connections for the reader.What will the Grail be for you?
3,"Nice begining, terrible end","Honestly, I like the movie, specially because I work in a Marriott Hotel as a Customer Service Manager, BUT the movie sucks for the last 20 minutes.For example, the girl run off the plane and start running away from the police. WHY??? I mean, she just have to tell the police there is a bomb in the hotel, but instead of that, she prefers to steal a car and try to use her cell phone and save the hotel all by herself.Stupid thought for a girl who looks smart at the begining of the movie."
4,GOOD THRILLER RIDE!!,"I saw this movie few days and ago and bought it for my DVD collection! ...Real good thriller, have a lots tense, suspense moments. Liked it a lot..Because could happens to anyone! And ""RACHEL MACDAMS"" a new comer she gives a real good solid suspense /thriller to this flick...if u like suspense thriller /action, In this gender type of movies. Defiantly try this out! Edge of your seat suspense! B+"
1,suprislingy bad from 1300 feet up,youve seen rachel mcadams in comedys and drama but in her first horror flick she plays aperson whos going back to miami but while coming back she meets a nice guy at first cillian murphy who is actually trying to givie her something or unless hill kill his father it all happens in a airplane but whitch this predictable movie is not good
2,Crashes in Act III,"A plausible and intriguing setup crashes and falls apart in Act III, once the plane lands in Miami.For example, after Rachel escapes the plane (and why doesn't she just run up to security and explain the situation?), why does Jack insist on chasing her? Why does he need her? Why doesn't he just pick up a phone, call his partner and have the pop popped?And why, after the ten minute cat and mouse game at the end, does Brian Cox have to save the day? The whole movie was about setting up how cunning and resourceful Rachel is. So why can't she off the bad guy herself?I know I get picky in my reviews, but c'mon, it's all about the screenplay. This first-time screenwriter just throws it into autopilot -- remember, this movie is barely 75 minutes.And all this over the DEPUTY director of Homeland Security??????? Huh?"
4,RED EYE,"I really enjoyed this movie. Sorry to all the haters out there, but the movie is well thought out, thouroughly entertaining, and has a perfect cast. It's short, sweet, edge of your seat suspense, and I think it's one of those under the radar great movies."
3,Snake On A Plane,"I didn't know what this movie was all about befroe I watched it. I thought it was a supernatural thriller of some sort. I was actually intrigued when the plot started unfolding, I was thinking wow what an original concept. I will admit the story was original and fresh, the acting was fantastic. I think Cillian Murpghy is one of a kind. His look is so unusual and androgenous, he is hot isn't he? Once the plane landed and she stuck him with the pen, the movie started to take another direction of textbook run and chase, good guy vs. bad guy. You could pretty much write the ending yourself. Heroin saves the day and everyone goes home happy. I would have liked one more twist in the plot at the end, to give the movie and edge over your standard thriller."
4,Good thriller,"This is a really good psychological thriller. I was surprised that there was not any gore, which I don't care for anyway. There were lapses in the action, but this just left time to wonder what would happen next. The actors were very believable, and the chemistry between the two main actors was intriguing. The main character's secret was a good back story; however, some of the villains' motivations were not very well explained. It had a very American feel though, with the underdog fighting back and ultimately winning at the end of the movie. It was not a scary movie, but a mess-with-your-mind movie. Very nice!"
1,First Class Waste Of Money ( Rated -10 ),"This isn't going to be a nice review about this CD. This CD is being sold as an SACD and although it is in that format, it is just PLAIN STUPID STEREO, so WATCH OUT !>I bougth this CD because i remebered the voice of Marvin Gaye as being warm and full...so I gather...this SACD must be one great buy...well it isn't. The CD sounds just like a normal CD with added high tones, as if the EQ was tuned to boost high frequencies. The cd is not multichannel, something I think every SACD should be at least, but the worst thing is that it is FLAT in sound. The drums have absolutely no depth nor any body to them and sound processed according to Japanese style. The Japanase don't like fat drums, they like ienimienie-drums.This record has definatly lost it's ""Soul"".So if you still have an old record ( LP ) or such from Marvin, then do yourself a favor and play that instead of this. This really sucks and according to my review isn't worth the money you have to pay for it."
2,A lot of static,"It was cheap after rebate, but useless. Now this device is in my Junk Box gathering dust. The static interferes with the sound quality. The music would fade in and out depends on the locate of the car. If you have a proctector casing for your Ipod, the connector is either not long or narrow enough to fit the Ipod. Also it uses the battery from your Ipod, and will drain if you keep this device on."
4,So far so good!,"I know many people have written to say that this device was not worth the deal of the day price they paid for it...but so far, i have had no trouble with the device. The selling feature for me is the ability to change the station when it becomes static as I travel. With the usual IPOD FM transmitter, you preset the station to the device via your computer, so when you are traveling and the preset station (88.7fm) happens to be in use in the city your traveling through, you are unable to hear your IPOD. This device allows you to scan until you find a clear or unused station, to allow you to hear your IPOD clearly.I have not used the FM radio feature, cause I listen to the music on my IPOD."
1,Worst design,"To me this is the worst design with no thought behind it.Frist, it does not fit properly to your ipod. You have to keep holding it while its connected with the fear that it may fall out anytime..Second, instead of the existing design to insert the device in the regular power slot, it would have made sense if the device could be inserted from top (into your earphone slot). This way, it could be used with any device like a walkman or other mp3 players..Third, The color...This only comes in white. What if someone has a black ipod??Fourth, does not capture all the local stations....I would never suggest this product to even my enemy... Waste of time, waste of your hard earned money....Sajjad"
2,Dissapointing,"I found very interesting to have the ability to listen my ipod music into my car stereo, without investing in an expensive solution. Although I have tried, it has been impossible so far.I have also tried in a hifi system without problems, that means the devise works, but promising to listen even in your car, it is too far to be true...Good but disappointing..."
2,FM transmitters are not worth your money!,Do not buy this product unless you are getting it for $10 or less like I did. It is not worth it as it does not work well at all unless you're in the middle of Iowa.
5,Very Good Transmitter,"This transmitter is great! Tiny, light and easy to use. It works perfect!!! Just plug it to your iPod, chhose an empty airway and that`s it! It recives and transmits very very well. It owrk better in you keep earphone plugged on the Ipod... They work as an antenna and make the transmitted signal strongerSuper good"
4,works,"i have a 80g video ipod and i must say, the transmitter works great, only thing, is that i have an ipod case and can charge my ipod without removing the case but to use the FM transmitter i have to remove the case everytime... not a problem, just wish i didn't have to move it each time.all in all, i have no real issue with it and would buy it again."
3,It works.,This came free with the iPod I purchased. If I would have bought anfm transmitter I would have chosen one with the ability touse the cigarette lighter to keep the iPod charged.
4,Children Who are not yet Peaceful,This book is a good partner for Montessorians who are looking for ways to support students in their classroom in an effective way.
3,"Fun, but not quite what I was hoping","I am a middle school teacher, and I use these in my classroom. I bought this item (along with the Hugg-a-Moon) to help teach my 8th graders about space. I was hoping to be able to model seasons, moon phases, and eclipses. I was disappointed when I first opened the box, though. The Earth is so misshapen that it doesn't even remotely resemble a sphere. I re-stuffed it, though, and that helped a little bit. My students love them. Overall, they are ok, but if I had seen them in person I probably would not have made the purchase. Perfect for little kids, but not great for my purposes."
3,Its a round pillow,My wife had one of these when she was little and she wanted to buy it for our son. He was not to thrilled with the toy and simply uses it as another pillow. I suppose its difficult to entertain a kid with a pillow globe these days when theres Iphone and Ipads to play with.
4,I liked it,"I happened to think this was a passable novel. Jack has always been better with historical fiction. Maybe I'm just biased, seeing as how I love the period of WWI and WWII. Read Night of the Fox and others to get the best from this author.Dillon has never been my favorite character. The story picked up a bit toward the end. The KGB agent didn't have much to do. Rupert Lang was pretty neat. I like3d the way his plot wrapped up. I think Jack should have written more of a chase scene or something when Ferguson confronted Lang about the gun. The guy just ran away. Blast! Well, better call Dillon.Tom Curry was taken out too quick. The attempted killing of Keogh was okay. The scenes with Dillon down in the pit were tiresome."
4,Six string heaven,"A flatpicking fan's delight. Ya can't beat Doc Watson when he gets those strings a-ringing, although I have to confess being more partial to his vocal numbers, myself. Sixteen sterling examples of Watson's flawless guitar playing, gathered from various old Vanguard albums."
2,disappointing,The item had badly scratched glass that was well packed. It had to be scratched when packaged. Too much trouble to repack and send backIt was a lesson learned when purchasing such an item. I would rather pay more locally and have the ease of return.
5,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin,"I am a long time Castlevania fan, and this game has just what I like to see in all Castlevania games. Great sound, creepy environments, tons of cool enemies to fight, excellent boss fights, and plenty of great extras after you beat the game. In fact, this game has found a place in my heart for having one of the greatest levels in video games of all time! The Nation of Fools is the most creative level I have ever seen in any video game, and it closes strong with my favorite video game boss of all time, Legion.You don't have to take my word for it. If you have ever liked Castlevania games, this one is just what you're looking for. Get this game, you won't be sorry!"
5,"This show is funny, and Dylan Moran is a minor god","This series showed briefly on BBC America earlier this year. I caught only a few episodes before it disappeared. This thing is hilarious, and Dylan Moran, who plays the main character, is brilliant. He is a very funny man.This show is about the bookshop I hope to run someday, once I hit the lotto and no longer have to worry about money - maybe there are customers, maybe there aren't. Maybe you're nice to them - most likely you can't be bothered. Inventory? The books you yourself like to read. And accounting? Chah, add it to the pile, get to it after I drink this lovely merlot.Sounds perfect.Dylan plays a chain-smoking, heavy drinking bookshop owner who doesn't like people and hates customers worst of all. He's harsh and funny - and a bit of a train wreck.The stories, at time, border on the surreal.Very well worth watching. I hope they release seasons 1-3 (what, all of 18 episodes) over here - they're already available in the UK, but wrong format!"
5,Every episode had me laughing!,Well worth the money. I think I laughed about every 5 minutes during each episode. Just buy it and find out for yourself how funny Rob and Big are. You won't regret buying these DVDs.
4,"I love, love these guys!!","This was a V-day gift for the man in my life, and we watched it together immediately. Awesome collection. The only drawback was it is supposed to be uncensored, and there are still some bleeps and blurs. Rob and Big are my comedy relief. Great for some laughs!"
5,This show is genuine laugh fest,"As a watcher of the show from day 1, I must say that this is one of the only recent shows on television that has made me laugh. Both Rob and Big are interesting and amusing people to watch, and the way Rob clowns his cousin Drama is almost worth the price of admission alone.It's kind of tough to describe the show too much, because it's basically just two guys going around their regular lives doing crazy things and adding their own touches to everything. A staple of the show would have to be Big Black's motto ""DO WORK,"" which kind of summarizes the show just as well.Genuine humor is the name of the game, whether it's seeing Big Black's friend Bam Bam smash one of those modern hanging chairs through the ceiling, or shooting up Drama with a paintball gun, it's all very funny.Do yourself a favor and get this DVD if you think you can appreciate this ""Buddy comedy"" for what it's worth."
2,"Works, but barely.","It's hard to imagine how a simple cable could suck, but this has it nailed. Both the 800 and the 400 ends of the cable fit very loosely, so the slightest movement causes the connection to be temporarily broken. For most firewire devices, this means that the device will lose synch, interrupt whatever you were trying to do, and spend a painfully long time trying to re synch with the computer. It doesn't help that the cable is as stiff as a coat hanger, so the slightest movement will move the connectors. If anything touches this cable it will break the connection, so you end up tip-toeing around this thing trying to keep it happy. Yes, it does work. If you have to get from 400 to 800, it will do it. But this one is guaranteed to make you angry."
1,Firewire Failure,I was dissatisfied with the cable the 6 pin end was a not a tight secure fit and would fall out from the firewire port if the cable was touched. I purchased a Dynax firewire cable which worked great.
5,"Great, Affordable Firewire Solution",I have a MacBook Pro and I got tired of trying to find this cord in stores - everywhere I went it was $40 or more. This was a much more affordable and just as quality and effective fix to my firewire needs.
3,Does the job.,"It's just a cable but could be a big problem if its stops working. It didn't.So yes, I would recommend it to a friend."
2,"Works, but not the same as pictured.","Basically I will say the same as another reviewer. The cable showed up in generic plastic bag packaging, no Tripp Lite Logos like they boast to have, and the cable is not gold plated, like they picture. It's just a plain old cable with metal connector heads. It works(so far) but is definitely not as advertised. False. I hate that. But what do you want for 7 bucks?? Wait, I suppose honesty is at least worth 7 bucks these days."
5,Very Good Over All Book,Webmaster Answers is an over all good and helpful book. This book covers many of the problems I have had as a web-master.
1,Apollo 18,"Using Apollo 18 for me was much like being in orbit without Mission Control, and multi-system failures. E-mailing Project2 Interactive produces no response and the helpline is a cellular phone that no one ever answers. The game won't run beyond the first video clip. After waiting a year for this game, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in the manufacturer. Thank goodness it was purchased through a reputable company like yours."
3,lune,The only down fall about this softwere is that you have to do hall the step that they ask you to do with out taking a brake. It creat a lots a pression and you make misstake.
3,BUFF BODS AND SEXY CHIX,"THE ULTIMATE GAME is one of those martial arts movies that appeals to the testosterone and T&A; that's in all of us. Who of us over the age of..never mind..wouldn't like to have bodies like J.D. Rifkin or Paul Logan? What about the foxy chicks? The lush island setting?ULTIMATE GAME is an average film focusing on a tournament held for a million dollar prize, and the good team vs. the bad team. The fight sequences are fairly imaginative (choreographed by T. J. Storm, who also appears in the film) and there's a nice twist at the end.Rifkin is the All American hero; Paul Logan is the studly bad guy. It's a lot better than some of the other films recently released, so if you like kung fu fighting, join in."
2,The AI level is disappointing,"I am not a chess master but I played quite a bit as a child/teen. After I read an interview from the firm that developped this game (""a robust AI"") I was not expecting a first rate program but at least a good one. What a disappointment!! Even at the highest level, the opening library of the program is close to 0, the level during the game is low-average with some strange and bad moves from time to time.If you like chess and expect the level of an average chess computer program, do NOT buy this game, you will be disappointed. If you are a chess beginner, this game could do the trick provided that you do not progress too quickly!I also tested the on-line gaming and there was no human opponent... The AI proposed to play but the level here was really low."
2,Not Much 'Adrenaline' Here,"Disappointing...Only one or two good page-turners make it worth reading. But most of the stories in this book are not about true adventure or survival, one is written by a woman who seems to have put herself into perilous situations as a result of a severe lack of brains, so I could not respect her story. I also couldn't work up any sympathy for the mountaineer who felt it necessary to have relations with a goat. Apparently very few really adventurous things happened in 2002 so the author had to scrape the bottom of the barrel. Maybe we've 'done it all' and conquered the whole planet?"
5,"este disco es ""EL DISCO""","simplemente el silencio , es la punta del iceberg del movimiento rockero en mexico, su melancolia, excelentes letras, musica bien ejecutada, plagado de clasicos, es el disco mas grande de CAIFANES, y una obra obligatoria para todo el que quiera adentrarse a la musica de esta banda, no leas esto mas y ve y compralo"
3,Two out of three ain't bad...,"This set contains three ""family"" type movies. The first, Jane of Lantern Hill, was a well known and loved movie and DVD for me, and I still love it; the ensemble cast is marvelous and Sam Waterston does his usual stellar job. I had seen the Wild Pony years ago but forgotten what an enjoyable movie it is -- how a family comes to be from a tragedy. The Road to Avonlea -- quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. The children in the movie were just going through the motions, the adult characters were incredibly dense and every scene was predictable. However, for the first two movies, the set is more than worth the and I recommend this set for those."
5,Balanced Writing Excellence,"This book clearly and excellently explores the pathway to emotional healing from a balanced perspective. Seamands presents the human being as a complex composite of mind, body and spirit. He carefully shows how emotional problems find entrance into a person's life, and how it is the healing power of the Holy Spirit that enables one to recover from the wounds of the past. Seamands reveals a living, breathing, touchable Christ who completely understands who and what we are. I was at first skeptical about reading it; but once I began, could not put it down and there began a journey of healing in my own life that has completely transformed my spiritual and emotional existence. Though I first read it 13 years ago and have experienced tremendous breakthroughs in the area of emotional healing I will often refer back to favorite sections of the book for a ""brush up"" in areas I feel might need a refresher course."
3,Disjointed Hill Action,"if the hill battle(s) for HILL 861, HILL 881S, & HILL 881N was a chaotic confused disjointed series of separate actions...then the combat narrative of the book accurately reflects it. too often there hardly was any unifying overview of THE HILL FIGHTS to place each segment of combat in its overall context. this uneven splicing of oral history snippets (interviews taken from marine participants) was never skillfully woven into a graspable chronology of these hill battles and tended to make for a bumpy reading. the only redemption found in the book was the attempted examination and retelling of the early (and relatively unknown) HILL FIGHTS (for 861, 881S, 881N) too often lost within the larger story of KHE SANH & the 26th MARINES during the Tet Offensive in 1968. the controversial issue of the malfunctioning M-16A1 was also a nice touch."
4,Forgotten in the Longrass,"At last some daylight comes to this forgotten chapter of marine corps history. The 3/3 marines were rendered combat ineffective by this series of vicious and wicked fights north of Khe Sanh. The very tool (M-16) the marines were given to do the job jammed after several hundred rounds were fired. Although this book does not go into exacting details for the failure of the M-16 rifle, it does an excellent cover of the men involved in the fighting. Be not deceived, marines are trained to clean their rifles as needed. I am glad to hear that the U.S. Marine Corps is finally giving the men who fought these battles the long overdue recognition they so richly deserve. My brother Thomas Wheeler and the 3/3 marines, fought hard for their lives on those lonely hills north of Khe Sanh not so long ago. This book indeed does justice to the men who did the job they were told to do not so long ago."
5,Very Sturdy and I am guessing very durable,"I really prefer over the ear to block out outside noise. I have a big head and big ears and it does a great job. The micro is completely adjustable and the sound is just excellent. These should last me a long time. The price from IT Wholesale Direct was almost too good to be true but seeing is believing and I am a believer. Of course, I had to order a 2.5mm connector separately for about $10 but I could not be happier with this setup."
5,CECE ROCKS!,"THIS CD WILL BLOW U AWAY! ALL THE DANCE MIXES OF 'LIFETIME TO LOVE' KICK HARD! AND SO DO HER POWERFUL VOCALS! SHE IS A DIVA TO BE RECKONED WITH! SHES WAY BETTER THAN WHITNEY HOUSTON OR JANET JACKSON! NO ONE REIGNS MORE OF A DIVA THAN CECE! BUY THIS CD! IT CONTAINS SEVEN GREAT DANCE MIXES OF HER POPULAR HIT ""LIFETIME TO LOVE."" THIS CD WILL SURELY GET THE PARTY STARTED FAST! BUY IT NOW AND ENJOY GREAT DANCE MUSIC!"
3,Mariana en Padrisimo Magazine,"Folks!!! Mariana is featured on Padrisimo Magazine. You can buy this magazine through this site (amazon.com). I think this cd talks about her love life with el temerario! Too bad, they broke up, is his lost. Mariana keep up the good work."
2,fits just ok but doesn't hold charge,"This is the second time I have replaced the battery for my Casio Exilim camera, the last one was a generic as well but it has lasted for a couple years. It still works it just doesn't stay charged for more than a few pictures so I thought it was time to replace it again and this new one is no different in that right out of the box, it only stays charged for a few pictures then it's dead again. Frustrating."
2,Not a recommended battery,"I own 3 Casio Exilim batteries - the original one from Casio, one aftermarket from a different company and this one. I bought this new battery well over 2 years after my other aftermarket battery and over 3 years after my Casio battery. Those other two batteries provided more power for my camera than this brand new battery. Even after 3 years my Casio brand battery lasts 30 minutes of continuous UHQ video shooting; the other aftermarket battery 40 minutes, and this new battery 20-25 minutes. Horrible! I would return it, but the shipping cost is not worth it."
4,just in time !,"well let's say good quality, little time to charge and lasts a normal time, don't remenber if original was better in terms of durability"
4,Can be used and good deal,This battery is good. Price is reasonable and I enjoyed it in my camera. Thanks so much. Delivered fast and I like it.
3,Movie,"I read this book in Grade 11 at school in South Africa. As part of the course we watched the movie, so I thought I'd just let the earlier reviewer looking for a movie know that one exists. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that there's only an Afrikaans copy, as the book was originally written in Afrikaans (as with all Dalene books) before being translated into English."
5,"Before the Egyptians' revolution this year, there was the Estonians'!","Before the Egyptians' revolution this spring, there was a longer, quieter but equally peaceful revolution in Estonia. I knew almost nothing about it and consequently enjoyed this uplifting documentary that testified to the strength of the Estonian culture, but also to the human capacity for peace. The Egyptians, Tunisians, and other north African revolutions make this documentary topical. Enjoy!"
5,A Laywoman's Perspective,"I appreciate the approach to a large Old Testament book full of prophecies. I can understand the vocabulary and yet am challenged to grasp the wonderful meanings for the prophet, Isaiah's day, The Day of the LORD, and also our day presently. The Holy One of Israel is also our Suffering Servant and Redeemer."
5,A Call To Action!,"I loved this book. I would read it in the mornings while eating breakfast and it was a great start to the day. Erwin McManus is very passionate about his faith and he is very effective in trying to convey that passion. So many of his personal stories that he tells made just say ""Wow."" And then I realized how so many small things we do, the little leaps of faith that we take, can have such huge rewards and make so many differences in people's lives that do not know Christ. This book is definitely a call to action for the individual and also for the church as a whole. Let's be a generation that seeks to help the lost, the poor, the broken. Let's be a generation that puts other needs before our own. Great message!I would agree with another reviewer that things get repeated a lot throughout, probably because the whole book was based around the story of Jonathan and the Philistines. Could have been shorter, but still, an excellent read and highly recommended."
2,McNally's Meaner,"This book lacked a certain lightheartedness that we have come to expect from the McNally series. Archy shows off his heartless side when it comes to his treatment of Binky (he tolerated him a little bit better in the previous novels). I almost felt sorry for Binky after Archy refuses to go to his party and tries to steal his love, Bianca. This is a colder, harder Archy we're seeing. As for the plot, yes it's very convoluted, and we could have done without the subplot involving Bianca--it went absolutely nowhere. On the other hand, I missed Connie Garcia, who was mentioned only briefly in this novel. I was not pleased with this one at all."
2,Poorly contstructed - fail easily,"See the title. I tried to cut a few corners to save some money, and paid for materials that had to soon go into the trash.Two stars since they worked for a while!"
4,"Understated prose, Larger than life characters","Colleen Curran's novel about life at the last all-girls' Catholic school in Milwaukee is a disturbing, yet eloquent read. The tale of three high school girls- Astrid, Juli, and Thisbe- beautifully depicts the lives of three rebel girls in the 80s who call themselves the ""Whores on the Hill."" They try to live up to their reputation, and we see most of the girls' school and social lives through the bewildered Thisbe's point of view. Through Thisbe, we learn of Juli's suicide attempts and Astrid's self-destruction. We learn of the disconnection she feels between herself and her divorced parents. We learn how dangerous the search for identity can be.Luckily for readers, Curran doesn't turn this into a literary train wreck- Instead, we are treated to some rather extreme, but believable twists and turns. I read this book in one sitting, drinking in the characters and the stunning prose of this must-read novel."
1,boring book,"The characters do not speak to you. In fact, they put me to sleep. After Chapter 3, it is easy to lose interest."
5,very happy,My daugther enjoyed reading this book and read it several times. It was interesting and entertaining. It was about a young girl
2,paralegal handbook,much to simple - did not find helpful. maybe it could be used by some one but not useful by me.
2,good until it melts,"I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly, it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat. It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material. That was it, it was ruined. It lasted one season of riding. Felt good when it worked. It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat. After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine."
2,Comfy - doesn't last,"Bought in June. Used an average of twice a week for 20-30 min each use. The seat started showing signs of wear within the first two or three uses, but it was still usable. Now in February it has fallen apart. The seams finally gave and the gel is oozing out.Gave it two stars because I did get some use out of it and it was comfortable while it lasted. But, it's not nearly as durable as my last Bell gel seat, which saw more use each week and still lasted a couple of years."
2,Bad Choice,"While the cover fit well around the seat, it did not stay put. It shifted to one side more than the other AND the gel oozed out after only riding my bike for 2 days. I went to my local bicyle shop and they gave me a completely new SEAT (not cover) for my bike. It is made of foam which is so much better in so many ways. Don't waste your $ on this seat cover! Go with foam!"
3,Good product for a beginner cyclist to ease into the sport,"I would say this product is good for beginner or someone who cycles infrequently. It will help alleviate some bum discomfort, but it won't 100% reduce it. There is nothing that will do this.Please note that bum issues are a common complaint of most biking newbies and it generally takes a bit of time to ""toughen up"" your bum - it just takes time as you get used to riding. Ensure your bike is properly set up for you (e.g. right saddle size and type and right seat height) if you are experiencing prolonged issues."
1,Comfortable....for 3 days,"While this seat cover did provide comfort for my long rides home from work, it only lasted three days. By the second day the fabric that covers the gel was starting to stretch and tear. By the third day it was almost completely torn at which point I took off the cover and put in an order for a new seat. Do yourself a favor and just spend the extra $10-20 on a new seat. I paid $30 for a seat that has worked great and is more comfortable than this pad was."
4,A Very Important Book,"I was not familiar with Robert Bly until I read his poem Things to Think in Oprah's magazine last month. I was so touched by his thoughts that I just had to have more! This is a great book of deep thoughts, put into prose form. Great food for those wtih open minds and open hearts.Enjoy!"
4,Excellent Effort for a First Time Author!,"I read this book with great interest in the subject matter. As a nontheist, I am continuously pursuing an answer to the question, ""Why are Christians afraid to explore or question their beliefs?"" This author, a self-described ""recovering"" Chrsitian, expresses the thoughts and feelings he experienced as he became aware of scientific explantions for what he was observing in his chosen field of study, and started to question the religious dogma heaped upon him from birth. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to fellow skeptics looking for the ""inside scoop"" about the Chrsitian belief system from a recovering Evangelist."
4,Good Golly!,"That was my reaction the very first time I heard this album bustin' through my speakers. It's like they had no intention of trying to produce a hit single, they just wanted to crank it up and play their fannies off for about 40 minutes. Eddie is jaw-dropping amazing throughout all the tracks. No wonder David Lee is caught goofing off during ""Chains."" He knew no one was going to be listening to his vocals on this one. And ""One foot out the door"" may be Eddie's greatest lead ever (and that's saying a lot) because it's almost ALL lead guitar. And that, in my book, makes for a great Van Halen album...."
5,No less than Kick ASS!!!,This album kicks ass and there is nothing left to say...from front to finish it can be played over and over and over.
2,A disappointing piece,"I want to preface this review by letting everyone know that I am a huge Van Halen fan. That being said, let me go on to state that this is one of the worst rock albums ever produced. It is a dismal failure with the exception of three tracks. I don't need to tell you the names of the good songs. They are so easy to distinguish from the rest of the recording.I was shocked by the number of people giving this album five stars. It really doesn't deserve that. Two stars is more than generous. It's interesting to note that this album continues to rank amongst the worst rock albums ever made by many rock magazines.If you want the album to complete your VH collection, then buy it. But be prepared to be underwhelmed."
5,Excellent cable,"This works great for what it does. It is a good quality cable for a good price. If you need to connect legacy Firewire devices, this cable will work fine."
3,NOT a Tripp-Lite GOLD PLATED cable...Generic,"I am disappointed that this is a generic firewire 400 to 800 cable, but at least it works.It is NOT made by Tripp-Lite, nor does it have gold plated contacts. Those were the two biggest selling points for me...and they're not hereBut it works, and is a 10 footer like I wanted.BOTTOM LINE: I am keeping it."
4,Vintage Hoffman,"How well can you really know a person? This is the question readers must ponder in Alice Hoffman's latest novel BLUE DIARY.Dark, lush and beautifully written, BLUE DIARY is the story of Jorie and Ethan Ford and the consequences that affect their lives after Ethan is arrested for a rape and murder he committed 15 years ago.Devotion, betrayal and forgiveness are familiar recurring themes of Hoffman's novels, and she handles them masterfully in BLUE DIARY.And while Hoffman is never one to give you a happily ever after ending in her books, she does, ultimately, offer quiet optimism and hope in her novels. For Hoffman fans, BLUE DIARY will not disappoint."
2,My first Alice Hoffman book....,"and it just did not do it for me. so over the top in terms of her flowery prose and dreamy reality descriptions. however, thought the story line was great."
2,This was written by Alice Hoffman??,"I have read many wonderful books by Alice Hoffman and just couldn't believe how mediocre this one was. If you took out all the superfluous details (how many times is the word blue used?), the book might have been a mere 75 pages. I found all the characters unlikable and lacking in depth. This book was a big disappointment. Read Turtle Moon by this author instead."
3,A Thought Provoking Concept,"Blue Diary was an interesting read. It was full of vivid descriptions and well developed characters. Although the narrative was drawn out, I felt compelled to finish the novel.Blue Diary asks the question, can someone commit an unspeakable act and then completely change themselves for the better? This is what the main character, Ethan Ford has done. What will the outcome bring?Set admist a small town, Ethan was well known; the devoted and loving husband and father; the always available community volunteer; the one that would always sacrifice himself for the greater good. Imagine the surprise when this small town is shaken with Ethan's arrest. The community will no longer be the same.Alice Hoffman's concept of Blue Diary was excellent and thought provoking ~ can a person change, and if they do, are they responsible for past acts of the person they are no longer? I would recommend giving Blue Diary a try."
5,Please bring it back!,"Loved this color. Purchased all of their options (green, purple, brown and blue) and the Navy made my blue eyes look amazing. Would buy it again in any Lancome formula."
5,Sad with Review,"First, let me say something. I was saddend and greived with some of the reviews. I am not a huge Elsie fan, but one review really hurt me. It said that Elise's father was a drunk. Not so! He had good morals, but really did'nt know how to raise a child. He was probably frightend at the task. He may of been harsh with her, but not abusive.And another thing. The reason Elise craved her father's attention is because no one loved her, except a few adults who were charmed with her. But she did not see them often, and she craved love. And when her father would not give it to her, she was heartbroken.If you would like to know more about Elsie as a little girl, I would suggest Martha Finly's ""Mildred Keith"", #2-3, and also book 6. They are about Elsie's cousin Mildren visiting her at her birth home.I hope this has helped you!"
5,This book is marvelous!,"I read this book when I was about 8 or 9, and I loved it. This book is interesting, but I think the new Elsie books are better. They make Elise seem a little bit more human!I noticed that some of the reviews said that Elsie was too soft, well, that is partially true. She could of had a little bit more backbone, but the reason why she didn't tattle on people is because she considered it wrong, and she hated to get people in trouble.No wonder she was so good! Without having a lick of work to do, she had plenty of time to devote to self-improvement. And in some of the later books when she lived with her father, she had to but say, ""I am a little tired,"" and instantly she would be reclining on a couch.But overall it is a very good book and I liked it very much."
5,Excellent,This is a book with wonderful Christian values. Ideal reading for any Christian with salvation in mind for their children.
2,Try their later stuff...,"This was their first album (although it looks like the CD was released in 1994, it was on tape in 1978). Fortunately, their music improved with age (i.e., Carnival, Catching the Sun, Morning Dance, Point of View)."
4,great resource,this is a great book to have on hand if manufacturing is what you're trying to get into. a bit bulky though.
5,Classic Vincent Price.,This DVD has some of the best thrillers. One side is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne short stories. The other side classic tales of terror. All have Vincent Price and guest appearances from Peter Lorrie and other stars. Really good.Tales of Terror/Twice Told Tales (Midnite Movies Double Feature)
3,Unforgettable,"This story of innocence and failure is told by the beautiful and flawed Adriana, whose desire for a tranquil life cannot reconcile itself with the corrupt world she lives in and cannot escape from. Set in Mussolini's Rome, the elegant and readable story is full of the kinds of complexities and frustrations real life provides.Adriana is an unforgettable character, somehow maintaining her innocence and hope despite descending into what her society would call scandalous circumstances. Through her strength alone, it seems, the story manages to end with a touch of optimism.The reputation of this book precedes it, and so I won't spend more time describing the plot or heaping more superlatives on what is likely the best book to come from Alberto Moravia, one of Italy's most underrated authors.Read The Woman of Rome, and even if it touches you only afraction of the extent to which it touched me, that will be more than most books can aspire to."
4,Great Movie,"If you haven't seen this movie and are not about to purchase it please follow these instructions:1. Go to UPS or Fed Ex or any shipping store and purchase a large box and tape.2. Bring empty box home and disconnect all video equipment.3. Package your television into the box, along with any DVD player or other peripherals.4. Now ship the box to anyone else, because you don't deserve to waste your equipments lifespan any further.That is all."
3,Not as funny as I remember,Maybe my taste have changed since the 80s but this was not as funny as I remember. Still like it though.
3,Great film. NOT HD eye candy. Marginal audio quality.,"The other reviewer for this must be new to the format. The Blu-ray release of Fletch features a mediocre transfer not much better than the Jane Doe Edition DVD release. The picture looks overly processed with only a fair amount of fine object detail and lots of coarse texture. The grain is noisy and edge ringing artifacts occur throughout the movie. As for the audio, you have to bear in mind that Fletch was originally recorded in Dolby Stereo. So, despite the DTS-MA track, the best you get is some music bleed to the rear channels. Overall, the Blu-ray transfer is the best the movie has ever looked and sounded on home video but it is not worth paying more than $10 to own."
2,Poor movie... not really funny,"Not at all what I'd expected having seen other Chevy Chase comedies. The very idea of disguising the main character was pretty good, but what kills the film is an almost absolute lack of plot."
1,Retch,"The movie is just plain bad, not horrendously so. Chevy Chase has less talent then Anna Kournikova. What plummets this to One Star is that it somehow has gained cult status. Maybe the government is putting doping agents in our water, for whatever reason hundreds or more think this is legendary cinema. They are wrong and I am right."
4,"One of my all-time favorites, another great from the 80's","Fletch makes you feel good about America in the 80's. Although the story primarily revolves around a corrupt LAPD and the drug trade, Fletch's sharp wit and determination reassures the viewer America is still 'it'. Chevy Chase was made for this role, there is no doubt about it. It is only sad that the sequel lost the intelligence of the novels. I too, have seen Fletch countless times and I am pleased (and reassured) to see there are others as well! Other feel-good 80's movies I keep watching again and again (don't ask me why) are, of course, Berverly Hills Cop and Golden Child with Eddie Murphy. All music by Faltermeyer as well as Top Gun. Ahhhh the roaring eighties!! Yeaah!!"
4,Good film,along with Caddy shack this is Chevy Chase's best film.having said that this film had me laughing out loud.i especially loved the Basketball dream 6 foot 5 and a 5 inch Afro was very funny.this film was good all the way through.this is far Superior then the follow up.
2,Meh....,"For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas. We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away. I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight. It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky. To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast. I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
4,FABULOUS!,"I had heard about this product from Oprah and Racheal Ray...then I was reading about it in magazines, so I had to try it being the chocolate lover that I am. It took me awhile to order it because it's kind of spendy, but after I made it....IT WAS WELL WORTH IT!!! This is the best tasting chocolate drink I have ever had! The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because it took a little longer than I thought to recieve it, but well worth the wait!"
2,I don't get it.,"I saw this product on some TV shows and was excited to try it. I ordered 2 canisters and the price was over $30. When I made it, exactly according to the directions, for my family, no one really cared for it. They would've rather had milkshakes. It didn't taste much different than making it with hot chocolate from our local grocery store. It was a disappointment."
4,Moen Modern Paper Holder,"Simple lines, more of a delicate thickness and acrylic accents add interest. If you are looking for something a little different from most everything else out there at a moderate price point, this is a good product."
2,"Oh, please. Enough with the neo-punk pablum already.","So you guys want to do the punk thing, but you want to be ""different."" So you think and you think and you think, and what do you come up with? Ah! You'll do the ska horns without the ska music. Fine. But how exactly will that set you apart from all the other No Doubt/Green Day/Sublime/Blink 182 clones out there? It won't. This CD is nothing the listening audience doesn't already hear every six minutes on modern rock radio. I'll give you points for the clever lyrics, though. That alone sets you apart from the rest of the crowd. Now please--just do something about the MUSIC.That said, I predict that you guys will be HUGE. God help us."
3,1980 Phillies World Series Song.,"I am interested in getting the 1980 World Series (McFadden & Whitehead) song ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now"". (Phillies & KC Royal's) E-Mail: SJJDJR@CS.COM"
3,Too short,"Note first that the parallel end goes directly onto your printer. You do not connect this onto the end of an existing cord. I made that mistake first.The seller makes no mention of how short the cord length really is. Unless your computer is located directly next to your printer, you will NEED a USB extension cord. I was fortunate to have an extra USB extension cord lying around.Otherwise, this device worked perfectly. I am running on vista and lost the old installation software for my printer, and it still ran perfectly. I am not guaranteeing that for all operating systems."
1,This cable sucks,Nothing on this thing works. The driver disc is useless. BAFO's website support is useless. The cord is also so small as to be ridiculous.DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS CABLE.
2,usb to parallel printer adapter,This device is of low quality and I do not recommend. One was DOA out of the box and one was bumped into the wall (while mounted on the back of a printer) and the electrical contacts broke. Four are working ok. Thanks
4,Good quality but hard to clean....,"I bought the Le Creuset 2 quart casserole with lid and loved it, I needed a new small omelet pan as my old one was peeling non-stick and I use one every day for breakfast and single dinners. So, I thought I'd try this one after looking forever online and not finding one that fit my needs. I really like it, but I have to say it is very hard to keep clean. For some reason it gets stains on the enamel on the outside and bottom and doesn't just come off with normal scrubbing. Also, make sure it is well oiled before use. It says non-stick but it needs to be seasoned well. I chose the green color and really like it."
3,Fun Romance,"Yes, it's your typical romance book, but it's fun to read. Hoag's characters, Jace and Rebecca have great chemistry, and you root for them from the beginning of the book to the end as Jace tries to make up for hurting Rebecca years ago. Hoag has added some rather interesting supporting characters to the book like Rebecca's father and their neighbor, Muriel, who are also on Jaces side. A fun romance to relax with."
2,Yawn...,"This was the first Tami Hoag book I've read. I'm used to more intense romance books. Not only was this book a little boring, but I couldn't really like Rebbecca. She was just too mean and cold. I know the background and I know he left her for baseball, but he came back and apologized and genuinely really wanted to fix things. She just blew him off. I can understand her hurt, but not her anger."
5,"Good product, no complaints.","I mean what can I say, it's a sign that tickled me the right way! Shipping, etc... was without problem and well on time"
1,"The ""i's"" have it","Insulting. Idiotic. Insipid. Inane. I endured sitting through this DVD just waiting for, hoping for, one glimmer of a cohesive script, or an entertaining storyline. With its fractured scene changes, its offensive overuse of swear words, even by the child actors, its clumsy attempts at forced humor, ""Eulogy"" would best be laid to rest in a deep, dark grave of its own."
2,Bad version of X2,"Well, let's compare the awsome X2 with this version.Here we get:- The annoyance of having to turn your character around- Uglier stages, one stage is so bright it's hard to see which way Zappa is facing- 4 character battle, which is kinda fun- No story mode (or at least not near as good as X2)- ""2"" new characters- The exact same charactersprites and combos as before- Character screen that is so small you have trouble finding the character you want to play withReally, just skip this game and get X2. This is just an uglier version with some extras that just aren't worth it."
5,Putt-Putt CD games,"Putt-Putt adventures are great learning, problem solving, memory enhancing games for the younger set. Our twins are 4 1/2 and they love to find the clues and get the baby animals back to their mothers so the Zoo can open. It is challenging as well as fun, and you have to use your mind rather than just sit and ""shoot the aliens"" or such."
4,Funny and witty,"**** Maybe 5000 words does not meet the criteria of Ginormous, but it's a lot more words than 30, the number Beaner O'Brian is stuck at on her report about the opposite sex. Word 31 just won't come, leaving her 4970 words shy of her goal. With the clock ticking, she begins living her research. That will involve; dealing with a step mom who wants desperately to be ""hip"", discovering disturbing things about her sister's living arrangements, helping her dad's employees find love, seeing her sister's ex through new eyes, having what should have been a dream come true only to be a let down, and trying hard to be real. This witty, madcap look at love from a teen's eyes will entertain young and less young alike. ****"
3,u think u know me thou beaner?,"beaner yes i know you !, i know what you do at night with that taco sause and thous blasted fingers u grubby sack of saulsberry. U know guys you say well do u know who i am? perhaps you'd like to know if you'd like to see your cat again. I beat that pussy daily and play my infamous banjo toon just to watch it twitch and scream. I'm telling you tight know you know nothing of beaners8===D"
4,"Sturdy, color almost black","Sturdy product, and you get everything you need to install it in the box. The fixture is almost black, with a shade of bronze. That didn't matter to me, and they look great (they even match the rubbed bronze that I already have in place)."
5,Bewitched Season 7,This is another DVD set of the Bewitched series! I enjoyed all of these episodes!
3,"Not great, but it's a nice solid 4th release by C-Murder.","This isnt C-Murder's best album, His first album Life or Death I feel is his best album to date. This album is pretty much the same as his previous efforts. This album has some dope cuts, but some are just hella weak. Overall, I've always liked C-Murder as the best outta No Limit so I didnt hesitate to cop this album...I'm kinda dissapointed, but it's a nice solid album...if you a TRU/No Limit fan...get this for sure...peace."
4,Works Ok!,"I bought this product on my local Walgreens just to give it a try because it says that is an organic product and it just costs like $15.00 so I try it and I do exactly as it says on the instructions label... At first (before washing after 48 hours) my hair was very dry and i think that my hair color was lighter and my husband too, I was scared how it gonna be after I wash it but when I did it was very soft and like it says on the label it straight my hair a lot, was very soft and shiny and I do my hair with my Bio ionic flat iron like in 15 minutes and I have a lot of hair and very long.."
1,Think twice about using this,"I have medium curly, dark with about 30% grey, color treated hair. During my forties it's grown thinner, and began to frizz and lose curl. I've always worn it curly, but it's getting too frizzy to go without products or blow dry straightening. Using this, I just wanted to reduce my frizz. I only used it once. Although I followed the directions about ventillation, it gave me a horrible, long lasting case of asthma that is still persisting after 2 weeks. I already have asthma, but this is worse than any long lasting attack I've ever had. It also didn't help my hair. It came out softer, but it took out most of the curl without helping the frizz. I now have thin, frizzy, wavy, impossible to style (layered, medium length) hair. I'm slowly getting over the asthma attack using my inhaled steroids at a high dose, and hoping that both lungs and hair will return to normal in time."
3,Good for the price,Very nervous cause I have blonde hair and read that it would turn hair orange. So I tried it with just a section of my hair and it is not orange. I would say it changed the tone of my color a little bit but nothing dramatic. Even with only one section done you can't tell the difference between that and the other sections. I cant wait to do my whole head cause this section already feels good!I wasnt bothered by the scent either.
2,Don't waste your money,"This product did absolutely nothing to help my daughter's curly and frizzy hair. In fact, it seemed to make it even curlier and frizzier. It also seemed to dry it out and burn it from all the curling iron treatments it suggests you do. I would not recommend anyone to waste their money on this product."
1,U get what U pay 4,"The first time I applied this product, my hair was greasy and the smell was too strong.Once I washed my hair, it felt rubbery. It was straight but the texture of my hair has not been the same. I have been washing my hair twice a week in attempts of removing the chemicals but nothing seems to work.Good Luck with this one!!!"
1,"DON'T BOTHER, DOESN'T WORK","I have very fine hair but it has some wave in it. Unfortunately, I have to spend a lot of time trying to make it look less frizzy if I chose to leave it wavy. Otherwise, I blow dry and straighten with a flat iron. So, when I saw this product I thought I would give it a try rather then spend a couple of hundred dollars at the salon.This was a waste of my time and money. The only time my hair was straight was the 48 hours that I left the treatment on the hair. Once, I washed my hair (I did use the Organix Keratin shampoo and conditioner) it was as if I hadn't use the keratin therapy product at all. My hair was the same as it was before with the exception of the color. It definitely lightened my brown hair.I followed the directions step by step but did not get the results I was hoping for. Save your money and go to a salon if you want straight, frizz free hair."
3,Nothing special,"I've used this product about halfway down, and I've found it to be nothing special. As an oil and a sort of primer product, it performs fine. But I've noticed no improvement in my hair breakage, and if you use just a little too much it looks way too oily. It does not weigh my hair down, but that's what I NEED it to do because I have poofy curly hair. Overall I am impressed with Organix products, but I won't be buying this one again."
2,It didn't do what it was supposed to do.,"As a beauty and fashion professional, and I was totally disappointed with this product. I followed the directions closely. My hair got straight after applying the treatment and flat iron. It stayed sort of straight during the 2 or 3 days i was supposed to leave. But when I washed it out, regardless of how much i flat ironed it, it didn't stay straight for more than a day. If I have a busy day, i had to flat iron my hair 2 times a day.My advice, spend the money, DO YOUR RESEARCH and buy a better product."
3,It's...whatever.,"I bought this stuff for my very long, curly, dry, and somewhat coarse hair (that is damaged). I decided to try it for my crazy split ends, and I've noticed they become more noticable whenever I do use this product; no need to comb through my hair looking for split ends. The smell is kind of strong and obnoxious, so I don't really like the smell of my hair right after I use it. Besides the little bit I already mentioned, I saw no change/difference/improvement/anything with my hair. It was only an ""okay"" product and I don't plan on purchasing it again or even recommending it."
2,Too old for this CD?,"I guess I'm too old for this one. I first learned to like Don Edwards with his West of Yesterday, Chant of the Wanderer, Saddle Songs I & II. This is NOT of the same type. If I'd wanted to hear the a Symphony Orchestra I'd have bought a Boston Pops record. And I don't care to hear Waddie over and over; I can listen to Night Hearder, Prairie Lullaby, Chopo, etc., over and over and never get enough. I wish I had known the format of this before I bought, I'd have passed and put on Chant of the Wanderer instead."
1,This program would not work on any of my 3 computers!,"This program seemed to start out fine, but consistently froze up and caused my computers (all three of them-I tried each!) to shut the program down. This program looks as though it would be really fun if I could get it to run!If anyone knows how to solve the Windows QuickTime 32 Error that shuts the program down please let me know. I tried to contact the makers of the program, but they seem to have fallen off the face of the earth-emails returned undeliverable, website no longer up and running, etc.Quite disappointed so far!"
4,Pure Magic,"A while ago, before OS X was released, my mum and I saw this in a Noodle-Kid-Doodle store. It was only $10 so we decided to get it. As soon as I got home, I played it and fell in love with it. I recently re-discovered it and still love playing every puzzle.It is pure magic how well the game runs on mac. No matter how many PC's I have tried, it doesn't quite run as well as my macs. I love how challenging the puzzles are, yet each time you find one, if you think, you see exactly what you need to do.I am quite disappointed it was discontinued, but everything ends up that way. Truly a magical, mystical, and fun game if you have kids. I recommend this all the way."
3,Okay,"I purchased this book thinking that I was going to get an intimate look inside the life of Mr. Simmons but instead all he gives you are accounts of his battle with weight loss throughout the book so far. The book started off pretty interesting with the lives of his brother, mother, and father and his interesting upbringing but it doesn't tell you much about his personality,fears, desires, goals, etc.. Hopefully the book gets more interesting as I get closer to finishing it, whenever that will be."
1,Alone in your mind,"I have to agree with the two reviewers who were less than enthusiastic. I picked this up because my husband comes from a family of 16 children. I was curious to see what Mr. Zanichkowsky had to say about his childhood. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. I waded through 261 pages of self-pity because I was hoping for some redeeming moral value, but I was disappointed. His sexual interest in his sisters disgusted me, as did his draft-dodging, thievery, and drug abuse. I probably could have understood the latter three if I had felt he was driven to it, but all I got from his personal account was that he did these things because he wanted to. It was all about him."
5,Miss Nelson is Great,"Miss Nelson is a great book. I enjoy it and so does my family. I am a big fan of Miss Nelson. This is a good book. It has a lot of characters. One day, Miss Nelson disappears. Who is the new substitute teacher? Find out when you read the book."
5,Favorite Book From Childhood.,"This way my favorite book when I was in school, and now my son loves it too. Such a nice simple story."
5,Mom is missing....,"A happy story about appreciating what we have!The illustrations are fun and bright.I have loved this book since I was a kid. My kids don't quite understand the underlying manipulation, but I totally get it. I wish there was a way I could do this to my kids to have them appreciate me a little more. Is Detective McSmog still searching?"
1,"Poorly produced, conspiracy threory, quack-u-mentary.","There may be a compelling story somewhere in this documentary, but it is so poorly organized and terriblly produced that it is about impossible to follow the sotry line. The 2 men in the documentary are talking like they are having a living room, or bar conversation about information they are familiar with, and perhaps assume the watchers are equally familiar. However, it is like walking in a room after the punchline of a joke was told, and you have to figure out what the joke was about. That said, I was interested enough in the title to shell out $3, but what a waste of money. My summary- this is a totally low budget and poorly produced quack-u-mentary, with a high amount of infused conspriacy theory, but lacking any real proof or story line. What does it need to be a more credible documentary? It needs to be organized with an order and presentation of infomration that provides the viewer a cohesive and compelling story."
4,Very Promising Effort by First-Time Director,"Madhouse is a low-budget movie by first-time director William Butler. But don't let that fool you, or scare you away. The movie's creepy atmosphere, solid script and direction will leave you satisfied and looking forward to future efforts. Butler is able to get strong performances from his entire cast. Among the most notable actors/actresses are Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever, Club Dread), Lance Henriksen (Alien series) and Joshua Leonard (Chronicles of Riddick). Butler's sets are genuinely sinister and creepy, which is critical for the subject material. Definitely give this one a chance.....any horror aficianado should be introduced to Mr. Butler's first work. My guess is that we will be seeing a lot more from him!"
3,What a surprise,"I'm surprised at the viewerreaction to this film. I'm even moresurprised that for the first time,I agree with the majority.This movie really caught me off guard.Based on the cast, the plot (on theback DVD cover), and the DVD photos, it had allthe trappings of a B-movie, low budgetcesspool. However, ""Madhouse"" was justthe opposite.The setting,of course, is nothing new, butthis movie takes a bold and unusual twist.The ""savior"" is really the villain, and it isdisguised so cleverly that the viewer isn'taware until the final minutes of the movie.The hero is on a noble mission, but let's not forgetthat he is insane. His objective is to clean updirty dealings in mental institutions, but he'swashing everything in blood. The murder scenesand special effects are also suprisingly good.I recommend this movie because it is rare to seemainstream quality scripting in a low budget,straight to video film."
2,Unfocused,"Susan Choi is a fine writer with an understanding of the complex layers of humanity; however, in her novel American Woman these layers rarely came together to create full characters. Details of life habits do not, of themselves, endow life. The plot, borrowed from history, is nothing without the characters: how their inner reflections shape their external relationships. Unfortunately, Ms. Choi offers a profusion of details without definition, leaving Jenny and Frazer unfocused while Juan and Yvonne remain caricatures. Pauline is her most successful character--never her own person, but always as others see her."
2,"Lots of effort, little payoff","I read ""American Woman"" without knowing anything about it, and was shocked to discover somewhere along the way that it was supposed to be set in the 70s. The author makes no attempt to ground the novel in a period or mindset as others have noted, and the result is a very writerly, turgid ordeal. I kept going, hoping to find a resonant character or interesting idea, to little avail. By the end, however, I did work up some outrage--fury that writing programs and their progeny have so denatured and disemboweled American fiction. Fight the power! Shut down Iowa Writers Workshop!"
2,Overrated,"This book is overrated. The writing style is verbose, the dialog limited, and the characters are undeveloped. All of the characters sound the same. There is no character development. The author needs to go back to school. Some of the sentences are very carefully crafted, even poetic but other than that the book is overrated. The book's greatest strength is that is based on a fascinating event. It's puzzling that a young author would attempt this topic. At times, I thought how could she have possibly have understood this movement without living through it? Her depiction of that time period is oversimplified and trivializes history. If you are bored and have extra time, the book is entertaining due to the Patty Hearst theme. Otherwise, I would save my money and time. The author is a frustrated poetic and not a novelist."
3,not quite what I wanted,"I ordered this to go along with the glass etching I had been doing. I thought, ""What a great idea! I can color my etchings and make them even more unique!"" When I got the product, however, it doesn't work on glass. The coloring wipes right off. If you use this, make sure it's on glass that won't be touched, or you will lose the coloring too."
4,Decent shoes,"This is about the 4th pair of these I've bought. They are nice and confortable, and look good. Only problem is they make my feet sweat a bit. Still a good value IMO."
4,"Wonderful item, high price.","I own several items made by StackAShelf and they are for the most part wonderful pieces. The material is spotless when unpacked, and the wood is very smooth and consistent in grain. However, like the other review said, Amazon.com is not the most economic way to shop for this particular brand, as it can be found much cheaper at places like Target and Fred Meyer. Happy shopping!"
2,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"This product is NOT a Tripp Lite F019-0006 cable. There are no gold connectors. It is an inferior knock-off. Yes, it's cheaper, but it shouldn't be listed as if it were the Tripp Lite cable."
1,Simply DOESN'T work,"As far as I can tell, this product simply doesn't work. I tried to use this product to connect my camcorder (and a friend's camcorder) to my MacBook Pro. The product didn't work except for a half a second when trying to connect my friend's camcorder (got a connection for a half a second, then, nothing.) Unfortunately, Belkin cords (recommended by Apple) cost $50 each! Why??? It's just a dang cord! It would appear that these people are making money by selling cords that don't work while Belkin is making money selling cords that (I assume) work for the 'low' price of $50 each. Whether this cord would work under any circumstances, I don't know. At any rate, however, I can say that this cord - for whatever reason - didn't work for me."
1,Didn't work,"Received it in the mail in a timely manner, but it didn't work. No reason to send it back and get another because it would cost more postage than necessary. Wish I would have just spent more money and got a better wire... Now I have to anyway. Lesson learned!"
4,Cable worked fine (I think) unfortunately it didn't solve my problem.,"The cable arrived on time and fit just fine, but I still cannot get the computer to recognize the camera as input. It thinks it's for output."
2,A Big Set-back for the YuGiOh GBA Series,"This game could have, and SHOULD have, been so much better. The ability to maintain 3 separate decks is a welcome addition, as are the great number of new cards.However, the lack of a password system and the incredibly slow pace of the duels make this game almost unbearable. I thought World Wide Edition was a much more enjoyable game."
1,This Game Is SO WEAK!!!,"I went out and bought this game the day that it came out returned it the day after! Konami made this game a joke! What with no way to input cards with passwords, REALLY S L O W game play (the only way to speed it up is to hold down L and R at the same time) and useless cards to start out with, This is the worst game they have ever made!!!!! I'm going back to Worldwide as it is the best!"
3,Don't be too mistaken,"One must remember Ford's other novels, ""The International Jew"", and that like Woodrow Wilson, he too was an avid white supremicist. I do think the world could have easily done with him. And for those who romanticize his business ethic, remember that he had also employed a private militant security detail that violently suppressed strikes and unions. Maybe Henry Ford isn't at all the great one he writes himself out to be?"
2,Not a Tom Petty Fan,"A lot of people told me that this was a great film, even if I wasn't a big Tom Petty fan. It is a long film, about 4 hours. There is a lot of old footage involved which can be interesting and I learned that Tom Petty led a miraculously lucky life. This film seems to try to gloss over his entire life, which I am sure as with almost everyone there is too much to talk about in four hours. I wish that they had concentrated more on the really interesting moments and left out half of what did make it into the film. There are a lot of breaks they just show concert footage for some of his songs.If you really like Tom Petty, this is made for you. If you are indifferent or dislike him, this won't change anything for you."
5,Excellent Film,"Any music fan will really get sucked into this film. 2-discs worth of story that you have no idea where the time goes. 1 concert DVD & an audio disc to boot. Hardcore Petty fan or not, every tune they play throughout the film, you say to yourself, ""that's a good song that I forgot about"". Hard to say that about many artists out there now a days. I should have summed this all up with - it's worth it."
5,Learn from the best!,"When someone has had not just one HUGE success, but multiple HUGE successes, you want to listen to them and learn how they did it. Well, John Assaraf has had numerous HUGE successes and I'm certainly listening. I recommend that you listen too. The other thing I love about this book is that it focuses on achievement *and* quality of life -- getting the results but enjoying your life and lifestyle too. Great work John! I recommend this book highly."
4,NOT QUITE ESSENTIALLY BOB,"This would have been a GREAT 30 song collection but it is marred by 2 important songs not included here. Why SERIES OF DREAMS & NEW MORNING are not included is beyond me, but only politically correct in the minds of the bozos at Sony who keep cranking out repackaged hits collections by the same artist month after month. I would have left off both SILVIO & either NOT DARK YET or THINGS HAVE CHANGED and put in the 2 MIA songs. Don't be surprised if we get another Bob Hits CD by next week!"
4,Should be in every 'boomer's' collection,"This is the one CD for boomer's who haven't previously been into Dylan. He really is unique, and very good -- on most songs."
4,Basic Dylan but greates hits is better,Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits are a more lively production than this cd. This sounded much better when I previewed most of it on the computer for some reason.
4,Dylon,"This guy was a legend in the 60s and he is still working today! I liked some of his songs then, and I love the songs on this set even more now. My only disappointment is the set doesn't have ""Talking WWIII Blues"" so now I'll have to get an album with that song on it."
3,"good, but by no means ""essential""","It is completely rediculous to call this CD essential, considering Dylan's been around for 40 years and has recorded TONS of stuff. A better title would be ""a brief tour of Bob Dylan's career, containing some of his classics"". Truthfully, there's no point in buying this album, not even if you're new to Bob Dylan. Not wanting to completely thrash this CD, I'll say that most songs are pretty good (as is most of Dylan's stuff). Buy an actual Dylan album instead of this CD. Some Suggestions: Blonde On Blonde, The Times They Are A-changing, Desire"
4,Complete Dylan,This is the most complete of all the Dylan recordings I have and that dates back to the 60's.
1,this guy ''Lastly'' cracks me up,"we all laugh at those foolishly thinking they can sing on that ''talent'' show,yet people are praising this shaggy hippy.is he any better than the worst american idol?it would be hysterical to see him cry when simon pointed him towards the door of oblivion.granted,he might have had something to say waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy back in the day.but how can 1 take listening to such noise?!?!?!? its not even the screaming,courtney love meets gilbert godfried kind of noise.its the incoherent gibberish of a sick drunkard.how in the heck did he last 4 years much less 40 ?!?!?!?!?? anyway,no review here will ever alter ones tatses but surly,dylan is in the top 2 all time worst ''singers''!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,great cd for a laugh,"my best friend recently both this cd at a used cd store for a mere dollar.he hated it so much he gave it to me.i love this cd,it's great for a laugh.this guy has the funniest voice i ever heard and even funnier he and millions of people thinks he can actually sing and to think this guy is considered a legend in the music biz.some people are stupid enough to buy anything and nobody thanks you more than mr.dylan."
1,Two Words; Voice Lessons,"I don't usually rant but it, at least from my prespective, probrably different from yours, seems that bob dylan is an incredibly talented lyricist and I absolutley love covers of his songs. But he belongs in poetry, not in music, or he should have at least sometime over the last 40 years taken a small share of his millions of dollars and taken voice lessons. Because I know from vocal experiences that ANYONE can learn to sing at a professional level. I mean the fact is 'as is' he's not where he needs to be and as a performer he should be not so much looking past his wealth, because I know that still means alot to any preformer, but he should be putting his first priority in making sure the people who pay his checks get the best possible product, even if he's no Freddie Mercury or Billy Joel just the best Bob can do. and he in my eyes is no true performer"
5,Phenomenal! I can't get enough of it!!,"I'm half way through this book (after having read Bob Frissell's 'Something...' in four days) and I can't put it down but to write this review! Worded in a wonderfully simple and enjoyable manner, Bob helps us to see all that we are and that all possibilities are open to us. Finally it's time to stop seeing ourselves as victims of life but masters of our lives. Far from being 'new agey' this book talks to the reader plainly and simply. It's a frank discussion with your soul, reminding it of it's essence.I have an exam this weekend but can't put this book down to revise. Aargh!"
3,"Many cars, few information","You can't say a lot about a lot of cars in just one volume. The book has infinite makers, but only few lines about each of them. The big pictures are concentrated in the 90s, so they are not so interesting. I recommend the book just for a bargain price."
2,A little flimsy - could just be us,"We had previously bought a PricePfister (PP) that looked similar but it was more money. So we thought we'd save a little money and order this one. We sent it back! I'm sure it would work, but it had a squeak and it was much thinner/flimsy'er than the PP. Had we not already had the PP one, we may have liked this one (after a little WD-40)"
5,Paper holder,"Great product. Matches the towel rings beautifully, is strong, not plastic but metal, and looks really nice. Matches other oil rubbed bronze fittings nicely."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"After fighting with this item for the past 10 months trying to get it to stay in one place, I have given up. The spindle kept spinning around the device will not stay tight on the wall the the hook finally fell off with no way to put it back on. All in all I would consider this a piece of junk and not worth the money."
4,Works Great,"First time I have used a strainer--made applesauce! The strainer is easy to put together, and easy to use. The kids had a great time watching me strain the food too. It gets a little messy, but that's part of the process. What I love is that it seperates the fruit from the pulp."
4,Works well,"I made about ten quarts of pear sauce with it this fall. It made my arm a little sore, but all in all it worked ok."
4,Another mouth-watering mystery!,"And this one is set around the Christmas season in Lake Eden, Minnesota. It's December and it's cold, but the town of Lake Eden is heating up with a national bake-off contest being held in their small town. Hannah is involved as a judge, but she also gets involved in a murder when one of her friend's finds her own husband dead in their garage. Hannah of course cannot stay out of the investigation, and while sleuthing she finds blackmail and more murder in the supposedly quiet town of Lake Eden. There are more wonderful sounding recipes in this book just like the first one. I don't recommend reading these books with an empty stomach at all. This is an enjoyable cozy series, and I can't wait to read more about Hannah and her friends."
5,GREAT!!,"Huge sound, powers your whole body. easier to whistle to than rap. always lifts my spirit and gets my day going."
3,A neat concept.,"User friendly, but could have more options with Fonts and size of print. A wonderful idea to replace scrapbooking."
5,Excellent Product!,"The Epson Storyteller is an excellent product! I have used it for numerous scrapbook projects. It's very easy to use and the only time I've had trouble with it is getting it to print the storyteller long paper for the cover, because I don't have a printer that's compatible with that. Other than that, it's great!"
4,Loved it!,"I've only recently been introduced to the Feline Breeds series and have been reading the stories piecemeal. Of the books that I've read in the series so far, this one is one of my favorites. I love that the characters have a painful history that they are able to work through in order to find their way back to each other. Definitely going in my keeper pile."
5,breeds,3rd in feline breed series. scorching sex and animal sensuality abound in this book.Lora Leigh has proven to be an author I absolutely must have in my library!
2,Was not impressed....,"Before amazon got real big on individual songs (mp3 format) I bought this album based on one song ""Find a New Way"", and let's just say that is the only song on the album I can bare to listen too! I am all for the techno field but where is the real music and songwriter in this kid, Do I feel he is talented, yes but this album did not show that one bit!"
2,not much of a good game,"This is okay because you get the Winged Dragon of Ra. But I don't like the game. At first, you begin to like this game a lot, but soon you begin to lose interest in this game. One problem is that the cards you get. The cards you get aren't that great. You only get cards from Blue Eyes White Dragon to Pharaonic Guardian, promo cards, Japanese cards, and some animated scards. Another is the 3D battling. The monsters only appear when they attack and all you see is 3 second glimpse of the attack. It doesn't actually look they were attacking. Also this game has no story mode. There's no story making it very boring. If you're a Yugioh freak, buy it. Otherwise, I would recommend you rent it."
5,Simply amazing!!,finaly a 3d yugioh game on a big console. I'm glad I have a reason to dust off my xbox. The game is wonderful but the promo card gimic egyptian godcard which is forbidden is horrible.. I thought upperdeck had more sense than to release a god card before it could see legal tournament play.
4,excellent as a textbook,"Great book for orthopaedic or neurosurgery medical residents, and also for spine surgeons who wants information in one single book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I used both the OxiOut Algae & Mold Remover and the Oxi-Shield Barrier on my flagstone patio, which stays partially shaded. As a result of the shade, the new patio stones had turned green with algae. I found these products in my local Ace Turner Hardware and hoped that they would do the trick.The OxiOut cleaner worked great, especially when used with a pressure washer. But, I can't say the same for step 2 of the system, the OxiShield Algea & Mold Barrier. We even applied two coats and the algae quickly returned, just as bad as ever. I emailed them for an explanation but to date, I haven't received a response. Don't waste your money."
4,Lewis and Clark and me: a dog's tale,A different view of the Lewis & Clark expedition. Fascinating story. Being from Oregon and being owned by a Newfie I really enjoyed it!
4,I use it every day!,"What I like most with this sewing machine is that it almost does not vibrate. Lots of stitch patterns to choose from, the thread is easy to install. I really recommand it"
1,3 year lifespan!,"After 3 years it just died. I was so happy at first because it seemed to do so much. But lightweight made some jobs like upholstery fabric difficult. Might be ok for mending but if you are a sewer...beware.I thought since it was a Singer I could get rid of my 60's Brother and I did...boy am I sorry. It would have still been working and now I have no sewing machine.Sorry Singer, you are losing it."
2,Terrible threader,"I bought this for the self-threading feature, don't bother. I got it to work once and didn't even know it. I'd been trying a long time, gave up and went to bed. In the a.m. got up to try some more, asked my husband to have a look. He said it was threaded. Used it till I needed to thread again, still can't get it threaded with feature. The light is worthless and I can't seem to find a position for my own light that helps to see what you're working on. It's a big dissapointment."
3,Ok,"This cover said it was ok to put on right after a ride with hot pipes.....well.... Not that good. I have been using it outside for two weeks and it has two rips in it, I don't know where they came from and it melted a little bit on one of my pipes."
2,Did I watch a different DVD than you 5-star reviewers?,"Make no mistake, I wanted to like this DVD a lot, but there's no getting around the fact that at 65+ y.o. Marty's voice is pretty much shot, at least in a live setting. Yeah sure, the video production is amateur all the way, but if he had sounded halfway decent in the Boston show, I could have overlooked all that. He did not. I've heard other examples of this on the Mick's Picks live CD set from 2007. You find yourself being embarassed for the guy cuz he was one of the great ones. And yet his studio CD's from the past decade are pretty good.....go figure.There are some bonus tracks from other places, and two of them, Fitzgerald's 2006 and Madison, WI, 2007, are just him and Slick Aguilar, and they're not bad. He doesn't reach for the moon vocally. Plus in Madison he sings a version of ""Somebody to Love"" which was worth getting the DVD just for that, very nice."
4,A good bit of techno-action writing.,"How can I briefly describe this book? How about this - it is a mixture of the movie ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and ""Hunt for Red October"", mixed in with a little ""Top Gun"".The characters are pretty-well done, but there's not much fleshing out except for the main three characters, and even those are a bit on the sketchy side.The military action is well done and the dog-fights are frequent, riveting and well-written. This is my first book by Gandt and I'll be looking for more!"
1,Didn't read,I'm an old submariner and was intereted in reading. then I bought a kindle and have been very happy with it.
3,communication is the only folly,"It seems like the only thing I found issues with this game was the communication to the character in game, sometimes when you would say things even if its what the game is supposed to understand she wouldn't get it, The game could get 4/5 if when you speak to her she would understand you, video games are still in early stages to be able to understand each individual, and such is crucial to the game if you need a headset to play, other than that if your voice is clear and not too fast or blurry its just about playable and even then there is some mistakes in communication between you and the video game. Overall I would give it 3/5 for innovation and a step through the door to some next generation gaming more technology is needed for this to be perfect. I will play it to the end because of the storyline I find it interesting so far and want to see it unfold."
2,Little wicking going on,"I have a Kenmore humidfier that I run all winter. My biggest gripe is the filter. Its wicking power only lasts about 2 weeks, then the top part starts to dry out and get hard and brittle. After that, I flip it, but a couple of days later, the top is hard and brittle again. It reduces the effectiveness of the humidfier. To get maximum effect, you would have to replace the filter as soon as this top part is dry, which is about at the 14 day point. This could become expensive...I wonder is there any other filter materiel we could use? I fill the tank every morning and every night...I never let the reservoir go dry."
4,A great film with a superb cast,"Tuck Everlasting is a good film for preteens and teenagers. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the plot of the movie could have been made better. Also, it is too short. I would love it if they show more scenes between Jackson and Bledel. Their love story is packed in this 20 minute scene and that sucks especially for a romantic sucker like me. The performances of the actors in the film are solid. Bledel and Jackson have a great chemistry - but I still wish that their love story could have been further explored by the director."
2,No comparison with the 1981 version,"Demand that someone release the old version on DVD. The characters were much more interesting, the action truer to the original Natalie Babbitt book, the sweet was sweeter, the evil eviler. It's too easy to portray evil as a leering, sneering, menacing ""man in yellow"". How much harder (and better) to put a pleasant face on it and let the actions speak for themselves. For all the characters it almost seems as though the director wrote down a two or three word description and told the actors, ""This is your character; now, read your lines."""
5,Don't forget the soundtrack!,"As a long-time collector of lush, beautiful soundtracks and scores of motion pictures...this particular score is outstanding! In the ""music"" section of Amazon, listen to the samples of this soundtrack...and rest assured...the entire score is as good...and better...than the short samples."
3,Almost a Perfect Movie,"I think Tuck Everlasting is a good movie. It is a serious movie and a bit dramatic and exciting. I like how Winnie is older in the movie so it is more of a relationship between Jesse and her. My favorite part is the jail break. The music and the thunder make it very exciting. it is exiting but it is very serious. It ain't funny so I don't think it's a great movie. so if you like serious movies, you should get it."
4,Shooting and always Living,"The movie Tuck Everlasting is a romantic and exciting movie. When the Tucks kidnapped Winnie she is frightened and full of fear. Then Winnie starts to fall in love Jesse. Jesse and Winnie go to many different places together. I really enjoyed the jail break. This is my favourite part, because it has lots action and shooting. The jail break is also my favourite part because it's humorous and suspenseful. The movie is really suspenseful because of the music they used. The music makes me have different feelings. It makes me feel frightened, scary, dismayed, and other feelings. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I really enjoyed the movie, and I should stop yammering so you can go ahead and watch it yourself."
4,Classic.,"The main reason I went to see this film is because I am a huge Alexis Bledel fan (lots of people even say I resemble her). I had read the book when I was a kid, and it had been a favorite of mine. Seeing the movie was a great way to relive the childhood glee. The movie is a beautiful, moving tale about a doomed love story. All the actors do a phenomenal job, and the scenery and costumes are beautiful. I'm sure it is not easy to do a period piece, such as this! I highly recommend this movie for anyone- from little kids to senior citizens. It is a timeless tale."
4,A really sweet movie,"I haven't read the book yet, but this movie is really sweet. Alexis Bledel really shows a whole other side of her acting abilities in this movie, versus her role in the Gilmore Girls. The movie is about the Tuck family and their unique gift: they can not die. They were traveling west in the late 1700's when they stopped at a spring and drank from it. The spring had magical powers and granted them an immortal life. The movie focuses on the love story between young Winifred (Alexis) and the youngest Tuck son, Jesse. Someone discovers the Tuck's secret and eventually the Tucks have to leave, but not before Jesse has to decide between Winifred and his family. I won't spoil the ending, but overall I think this movie was well written and would be a great addition to any child or young adults collection."
5,"Great music, excellent visuals, creative excellence","I have always been into esoteric as well as most kinds of good or creative music (Sorry, Rap is not creative, Country is not Good so I cannot stand those ;-) ). I like New Age as well as instrumentals, techno, and others which can be in any genre if the music soothes, moves, inspires, relaxes or entertains. Engima has consistently provided me auditory experiences which provide ALL of these pleasures. Watching the creatively done videos (especially as some were done at a time before today's dime-a-dozen CG special effects make it easy to do them for anyone) in support of the music definitely enhanced my pleasure. I generally do not buy music DVDs as I know I will never get to watch them more than once. But I made an exception for Enigma, and I am quite happy I did. (...)"
2,Go towards the light,"I own many cult DVDs, but this isn't going to be one of them. I rented this several years ago when it came out and again this week to be sure of what I thought. After the second viewing I concluded my first opionion was correct. This movie is boring. The jokes are't that good, and a arm growing out of someone's back is not going to be enough to carry it. Judd Nelson and Bill Paxton are great actors and really try hard to work with what they have or I wouldn't even give it two stars. Want to watch some good unusual SciFi? Rent or buy any of the LEXX series. It is entertaining, funny, morbid, scary, sexy, and everything this movie wishes it could be."
1,Better Luck to You,"""Santa"" brought this gift to our 2 year old son. He was so excited to get it. The Mickey Mote set-up is simple enough...IF YOU HAVE A COMPATIBLE DVD REMOTE!!! We have a Sony 5-Disc changer and the Mote would not program to our DVD remote. It wouldn't program to our Blu-Ray (also Sony) remote either. Practically, we paid $30 for a DVD. We tried to find a link to techincal support, but there is no such listing. I'm sure it is a great product if you can use it. Just be advised that it might not work with some remote controls."
1,unfortunately can only be programmed for use with a dvd remote,we don't use a DVD player. we have both an Xbox and a ps3. the controllers from either system were unable to program the mickey mote which sucks bc my toddler was really stoked on it. i got it for his birthday and now i feel awful that he cant use it.
1,Just Plain Awful,"Kurt Russell is talented actor so how did he end up in this piece of trash movie laden with over-the-top violence, harsh language and testostrone laden corrupt cops....? I should have stopped watching it when he came home to his lovely wife in a drunken stupor and spoke nothing but drunken vulgarities to her. I should have stopped there, but I thought the movie would get better but it never did. Hard to believe that Kurt Russell was....or should I say still is a sex symbol but after seeing this movie it certainly tarnished my image of him. Stay away from this movie....stay far, far, away!!!!! I'd give it negative stars if I could."
2,Skip it,"Ugh. This is a rote, by the numbers, mind-numbing LA cop drama. You've seen the same thing done dozens of times, only better. The performances are lugubrious, the script is unremarkable. The basic premise of the film is that LAPD corruption was responsible for the riots in LA following the verdict in the Rodney King police beating case, and the film endeavors to show a slice of that corruption. The result is more of a lecture than a film, with too much emphasis put on hastily drawn characters with no apparent motivation for their actions and grandstanding socially conscious speeches that ring totally hollow. If you go into this expecting to see something on the order of LA Confidential, Colors or Training Day, you will be sadly disappointed. This film does not approach any of those on any level, except to appropriate something approximating their look."
2,this can't be compared 2 training day,this is a really bad copy of training day. Training day is way better than this movie. The movie was slow and sometimes really boring.
1,HORRIBLE,If you want a good time watching crooked cop go and watch The SHIELD.This is a really bad movie.The previews made it look good but its worse than the ring.DONT Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not very helpful for infants,"I didn't find much usable information in this book. It basically said I can let a baby cry a little or cry a lot, but didn't give me any good steps for teaching him how to get to sleep and stay asleep on his own. I've since read a much more helpful book titled, ""The Baby Sleep Solution"" that does give good, concrete steps to follow."
5,Finally all Four!!!,"So glad Sony decided to put out the 4th season so quickly - we waited way too long for season 2 and 3!! This is a great season, David's hair has never been better, and while I could do without Ricky, my 8-year-old son seems to enjoy him. Well worth the wait to have the complete collection!"
3,Worthy,"Kept in suspense every minute. Danny Aiello finally displays his finer talent as the Don. Has the required skill. Kirsty Alley also pulls thru in anguish, pain and doubt toward the Don, the Clericuzio. Jason Gedrick, innocent from the start, a given for the future. Serious family business headed toward the flame. Ruthless to the point, perhaps wiser.Oops, I was talking about the The First Don, I mean The Last Don 1"
5,Its okay,"I wanted to buy this film because I have read the novel from Mario Puzo. It was not as The Godfather, but was Ok."
4,Intimidating,"I purchased this classic cookbook after watching the film Julia & Julia. I have thus far only cooked two items from it.The book is nice to display in one's kitchen, but for those with busy schedules, it is probably not that useful as the recipes require (mostly) considerable planning and time."
5,the real thing,"This is the real book as seen In the Movie julia, I was surprised of the price I got On Amazon.com. I forst went to noble book store and they didn't have it, thanks Amazon.com"
5,The book that made French cuisine do-able.,"I am sure that because of Julia Child's books, grocery stores began stocking more of the hard-to-find ingredients we take for granted today. I learned to cook from these books because of the easy to understand layout. The results were splendid. We'd have company for dinner almost every weekend; and our fussy-eater children would sneak into the kitchen to devour the leftovers.When they grew up, the kids wanted copies of the books too, and they became fine cooks. Recently, one of our daughters had to move a great distance, being forced to leave her things behind in storage. When she moaned about having no ""Julia"" with her, I bought the Kindle version (I had bought her a Kindle for her birthday), and she had her cookbook instantly. I love Julia, I love Kindle, and I love my daughter. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Let's get cooking!,"This is by and far the best cookbook I have ever owned. If you only own one cookbook, this should be it!"
5,You'll throw out all your other cookbooks!,"Julia Child is brilliant in the layout of this fabulous cookbook. The sidenotes suggesting drinks and accompanying side dishes with each recipe is marvelous. If I'd never known what a wisk or oven-proof dish was, I could place a meal before friends and family that would bring a round of applause after the first taste. Thank you Julie-Julia for such a reveal in your movie to inspire women to rediscover the joy of toiling in the kitchen again."
4,Another successful purchase via Amazon,"Glad to have found this specific cook book on Amazon and at the great price! It was a Valentines gift for my husband who is great in the kitchen. From what we can tell, the book is fairly simple to follow and Julia Child's information is very informative and helpful."
5,Mastering teh Art of French Cooking by Julia Child,"Who needs to go to Cordon Bleu when you have this book. Most recipes only offer recipes and great pictures. This book is like going for the $28,000 price tag of a cooking school with only the cost of this book and it is definitely worth it. The techniques which are well explained are what is important in a recipe and understanding the chemistry and the whys and nots behind it. My only regret is that I did not get this sooner. A must have for a beginner and master cooks. This is truly one of the greats of recipe books. Julia, you made me a firm believer that one one who really follows your recipes can be a very good cook. There is hope for the rest of us."
5,Very Good Beginner Book,"I just can say this book is great for beginner ! I played guitar and have some knowledge in musical theory. When I read this book, I found it's very helpful, and the CD companion kept me in right track when playing tunes."
5,AWESOME,"This game is the bomb! You get to sabotage enemy researchers and bases. You can play a battle, special, or full leanth game! When you choose battle, a group of machines are already waiting for your commands to destroy the enemy race(s). If you choose a full leanth (normal) game you start out with a few machines, and you start building defences, buildings, defenders, constructors, spys (they steal enemy research and lay mines), locators (to find mineral deposits), and other cool stuff! If you choose special, you get a huge battle!"
4,Great Product,Setup is a bit of a hassle and hard to get used to. Also the clock runs fast so you have to adjust it periodically. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,Works well once it's programmed.,"A little squirrly to program, but once it's programmed, it works great.One cat was dangerously fat, but once we got this, she dropped quickly and levelled off. We're all very happy with it.Dennis"
1,Defective & Substandard,"This product fails on every level. The instructions are convoluted and complex. The programming controls are not made for human hands and are of the lowest quality I've seen outside of a cereal box. Finally, the product did not function either automatically nor manually. I would re-classify this paticular product under pet euthanasia. The idea gets a 5 but the execution gets a 0!"
4,Does what it says...,"I was thinking it's lowest food setting (1/4 cup) was going to work for us. Turns out it's much more than I feed my cat at one feeding and I wouldn't want her to be fed that amount 3 times per day. She's already gained a little weight and I'm only doing one feeding with the Bistro and manually feeding her smaller portions other times during the day. Otherwise, this product is nice. It's reliable, easy to program, and hassle free. It's much cheaper through Amazon than any other pet store in LA that I could find."
4,Great for a traveler!,"I was a bit leary using a timer for feeding my cat while I was away for a short period of time, but this product worked great. The programming was a bit confusing at first, but once you figure it out it is not any problems. I did have to return the first one I received since it would not work correctly. Amazon quickly replaced the item."
3,Great product but poor quality control!,"Was so excited to receive this great feeder to solve the problem of coming back on time to feed my Furkid. Was greatly disappointed when I actually put it to use. Inserted the batt and it just can't seem to get to work. I have to smack it a few times before the LCD screen starts to light up. Cut the story short... It went on and off for the next few days and my beloved furkid has to starve for her meals when the feeder just die before dispensing the food. As I'm from singapore, I can't just send this back for warranty claim. Finally got pissed and open the damn feeder myself. Guess what!? There a wire inside that was just hanging near the contact point and the factory have forgotten to solder it... Since I don't have a solder, I just twisted it and it have been working fine since... Was greatly disappointed with the quality control and this will definitely deter me from buying this brand ever again. I must say that this is a great product though."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I have the old version of this feeder (which is great), but I recently purchased this new version and have been extremely disappointed. The new version may be easier to program, but it doesn't work! I've now tried two different ones and ran into the same problem both times - the food just isn't dispensed at the set times. The only time food does come out is when my cat reaches up and knocks the food out (another issue that didn't happen with the old version). Do not waste your time with this product...Petmate LeBistro Portion Control Automatic Pet Feeder, Black, 10 Pounds"
1,Broke within a week,"Well, I didn't heed the other reviewer's warnings and bought this piece of junk. The control panel broke within a week. a good idea but not made well at all."
2,"Garbage, but little competition.","Where to begin? I purchased two - one for each cat since they have different dietary needs. One needed to be returned within a week. Great start.Whoever decided the programming method on this contraption was acceptable needs to be fired and banned from ever designing another consumer product. Petmate obviously chose the very cheapest conceivable design and it shows. These things keep horrible time, the three buttons to perform all functions are confusing and not easily pressed, and the programming is kludgy and buggy to say the lease. The minimum serving size is 1/4 cup and the maximum number of meals per day is 3. These limits are much too restrictive.At the time of purchase, there were no competing products on the market. Now I see a unit from ERGO for twice the price, which may be a ripoff but since it has better reviews I'm considering them."
3,It's ok for what it is,"I purchased this to keep my cat from waking me up at 5:00 am wanting to be fed. It is somewhat difficult to program. The instructions weren't that helpful. Once it was program it works perfectly, however my cat soon learned how to put her pay up the dispenser and dig out a piece of food. At first I thought it was left over pieces that had not fallen into the tray, but after some investigating I discovered that she was able to move one of the teeth so that a piece would fall down. The cat would sit there for hours digging out food piece by piece. I tried several things to mess up the angle so she could no longer do this and still get food but was unsuccessful. Now I keep the dispenser locked in the pantry and allow her to go in when it's feeding time. This feeder does what it was designed to do, however it doesn't serve the purpose for which I bought it."
4,"Works great, hard to program","This product works great. However, the programming method is difficult compared to other timed programming such as VCRS.Also, I wish you could vary the portion size among the meals. But all meal sizes for a given day must be the same size. You can set the size, but the size will be the same for every meal."
1,New Design is Terrible,"We had used the old design for years - had to replace them every 2 to 3 years but it was worth it - they worked like clockwork - but just received the new 'improved' design because our old one didn;t dispense when scheduled. The new one was worse - just vibration on the floor made several pieces of food dispense, and it didn't dispense when scheduled. Sending it back - if anyone knows where I can buy the old design - let me know! If it ain't broken - don't fix it!"
2,Poor interface,"The digital interface is very hard to program. The amount of food released is insufficient for a dog over 50 lbs. The storage bin is light weight and easily toppled. The lid does not fit on very tightly, I had to taped it shut with duct tape. It does delliver the food on time.JCA DVM"
4,Does what it claims to do.,"This product does exactly what it claims to do. Setting feed intervals and quantities is not difficult as some individuals have stated. The instructions tell you exactly how it's to be programmed. If you are able to read, you should be able to program this device. The method by which you'll program the feeder seems strange, but, just follow the written directions and you're done. Do keep the instructions though because you're scheduled program will erase when the batteries are removed or the feeder is turned off."
1,Good in small doses.,"I bought this feeder to take care of my cats while I was away on weekends. At first everything was great so I kept it running every day. After 2 months of daily use the feeder stopped working. I exchanged it for another feeder of the same model which the broke after another 7 months. Maybe it will work better if it is limited to short periods of operation, but do not get this feeder if you plan to use it every day."
2,Does NOT work as advertised....,"I purchased my Le Bistro pet feeder about 1 month ago to make things easier on the person who was to watch my cats during my vacation. The item arrived very quickly, was easy to assemble, and fairly easy to program. It seemed to work like a charm. After a week however, the electronic clock began to slow, and was two hours behind the actual time. Then it began to dispense twice as much per feeding as I had it set for. I replaced the already new batteries with another set of new batteries, and still had the same issue after 1 week. Reprogramming does not seem to match the instructions. This item is fine for short term use, but not long term.... and please do not buy this if your pet has a medical condition requiring precise amounts/timing of food."
2,I wish there was an alternative to this product,"It's great to not have to worry about my dogs going hungry when I'm not at home. Also great to know they are getting 3 meals a day. Well worth the price.....but we have had to exchange one at the store and the replacement stopped working, so we sent it to the factory. They sent us a new one in about 3 weeks. We have two of them that we try and have go off at the same time. We have two black labs that must be part pig. The time doesn't stay synched very long. Batteries don't last long enough. I wish it ran on A/C. Programming it is not user friendly. Let's hope that they have some engineers working on the new and improved model."
1,Piece of Junk,"The first one worked for 2 days, then the display went out; I exchanged it for a new one, and the display would not light at all. I made sure I used new, charged batteries. When I called the company, they said they were very sorry, and recommended I either exchange it again, or send them pieces from the non-working one with a copy of the receipt, and they would send a new one. Am so aggravated, am returning it for a refund."
2,Auto pet feeder,Works fine.PROBLEM1. Programing instructions are poorly written.2. Must be reprogrammed after turning off.
4,Insufficient instructions for programing,Works well when you figure out the programing instructions. I wish I had gotten the larger version. I am afraid my begal will chew in to the bottle.
5,Easy to set up,"For $50, this is a nice setup. It dumps the food out no problem and is quiet. The only downfall is it runs on batteries. I'll have to see how long they last.If you have any technical knowledge at all, this thing is easy to program. I had it setup and running inside of 15 minutes."
4,Automation is great,"I love this machine! Our two cats used to wake my wife and me up every morning at 5:30 for breakfast...not anymore! The amount of food that is dispensed from the machine is slightly off, but I compensated for this by adding a meal and decreasing the meal size. (This is why I gave four stars.) Some people had issues programming the feeder, I did not. It took me about two minutes to program. (Tech Geek) If you are in the market for an automatic feeder, I would recommend this one."
4,Auto Dog Feeder,Worth The Money But Would be a better deal for you if you have a small dog my dog is a 80LB Beagle Mix and she needs one cup of food three times a day so the feeder runs out of food after only 3-4 days not seven days as advertised im sure if i adjusted it for a smaller dog it would last seven days before refilling.Marty Roller
5,My cat is loosing weight!,"I bought this feeder a week before Thanksgiving thus allowing time to make sure it was working before dashing out of town. I had no problem with the programming. There was another review that I read that the hopper and lid does not fit securely. I had no problem with that. It does have a groove that the hopper and lid needs to rotate into. Another review said that their cat figured out he could steal a few kibbles that were left in the hopper. My cat has not figured that out yet. It would be great if they manufactor made this with an optional ac adapter. The reason I bought this was 1) my cat would wake us up early in the morning before his normal feeding time and 2) so he could lose weight on the low calorie cat food the vet ordered. Both have been accomplished. No more begging and he knows I am not the hand that feeds him anymore. Peace and Quite. If it does stop working, I would buy it again."
4,"Petmate 24230 Le Bistro Pet Feeder, Black","I almost didn't order this item because of all of the negative reviews about the programming, but really needed something to feed my 2 cats for a week while I was on vacation so took a gamble. With the instruction manual it took me only about 5 minutes total to program to dispense 1/4 cup, 3 times/day at specific times. I love this feeder!! My only issue was that when I programmed it to dispense 1/2 cup 2 times/day it seemed like it was giving out a little more than 1/2 cup, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this feeder."
4,We've made it work!,"So, I read the reviews, but we were despirate and bought it anyways. Ours works great! Two months in, it doesn't skip their meals, the cats let us sleep past 7 am, and they don't bother us for food. I'm actually amazed that my one little trouble-maker hasn't figured out how to make the food come out. The two downfalls I've found are: 1) you can only set one meal size, so you can either have 1/4 cup three times a day or 1/2 cup three times a day, and the one is too little and the other is too much; and 2) you can only set up to 3 feedings a day. We've made it work, though. We give them 1/4 cup at 6 am, 12 pm, and 12 am, and then we manually give them 1/4 cup using the feeder at 6 pm.I can honestly say that after reading the reviews, I was afraid it was going to be a lemon, but if you don't mind making some compromises, I think it is an excellent item, esp for feeding when you want to sleep! The programming wasn't so hard, and once you figure it out, it's easy to remember."
4,good for exfoliation,"This product exfoliate your skin well, but its rough for skin like mine, I have sensitive skin, I can scrub it against my belly or sensitive areas, or it will get all rashy and red.. my husband love it. It does not make u lose weight, just sayin cuz some ppl said it does on website. No losing weight here. Lol. Just for exfoliating is what its gd for. :) smell ok, not as fancy smell.."
3,OUCH!,"I am all for some good exfoliation, but this is just too much. Anywhere other than my legs I have to be super gentle so that I don't scratch my skin. It's really not a pleasant bath bar. I'm reviewing the seaweed soap, not sure what the oatmeal is like, though they show on the same page. Wanted something natural with no parabens, but won't buy this again..."
2,You make me feel so young,"Evil Aunt Rachel and her sexy houseboy Ewen have a secret. Pandora, you're next!This rather unterrifying novel of terror had a good premise but the execution was a bit weak. Apparently this was Mr. Caveney's first novel, written when he was still a young man of 20-something. That probably explains it. Green novelists don't often appear on the scene with a masterpiece.""There will be no more slavery."" Oh, really? I wouldn't be so sure about that..."
2,My favorite guilty pleasure,"Ok, this book is not very good in comparison to, say, Shakespeare, but I read it over and over years ago when I was an adolescent. It's entertainment on the level of a good soap opera with appropriate amounts of scandal and sin. Fun, entertaining, and entirely seedy, and I'm positive Philip Caveney, the author, knew exactly what he was writing. I recommend it for anyone with a few bored hours. It's a page-turner on the same level of cheap horror, and I have to say the story intrigued me enough years later to search for and buy a copy. It was my first guilty pleasure, and it hasn't let me down as an adult when I need a break from the heavy stuff."
1,Five STARS for being most BORING!!,"I bought this DVD as I was curious about the spiritual difference of the animals being taken care of by a master. However, Ching Hai has showed how much she loves herself by buying and keeping birds in cages, telling parrot that it is a heavy chicken just to amuse herself, giving unhealthy food(eg. toast with butter)to dogs, not truly concern about animals' health on daily basis. She's just a show-off, flaunting her wealth with huge land, trees and houses. She can't even speak properly, no substance with all baby talk only. I shall never buy anything from her, feel cheated for buying this piece of garbage!!"
1,does not work,This product does not work! I used this on my trip to the french polynesia and i got >15 mosquito bites!!! My husband used expired Off repellent (with DEET im guessing) and he ended up with less mosquito bites than me!
1,Do not buy,"Don't buy this if you have Windows 7, as majority of household's do these days. There is no driver for this for Windows 7, and the product itself has been discontinued."
3,Video lesson is still valid but condition was bad,The actual video is fine for the kids at our Sunday School. The problem I had was the condition of the cover. This was a used video and I thought I was purchasing an unused video. Maybe this was my fault when ordering-not sure.
4,This wonderful story about Jesus,"This is a wonderful story, it's great, it has everything good about it, but, it is something about it that it's just something about it that just doesn't seem right. It makes it get not as good as a 5-star-movie."
4,Very funny.,I bought thus movie as gift for my kids as they are avid Eddie Izzard fans. Everyone in my family enjoyed watching it over the holidays.
1,Only for the curious,Amazing what this genius did at age 11. But on a bell shaped curve comparing all of his operas and those after him it is mediocre with moments of brilliance. They look like and feel like high school operas. The gem here is soprano Karg. The only reason they survived history is they are Mozart. No major opera house I suspect will ever stage these.
4,"If you're lookin' for a good movie, well ya dang sure got your wish!","I had never heard of this movie, directed by Jack Nicholson...needless to say it's pretty funny. I loved all of the character actors, and just the expressions on their faces throughout the movie. I've watched it three times already, and there are a lot of funny lines in it. It was worth buying."
1,Goin' South... is right,"I would give this * 1/2 stars. I think the only thing I found interesting about this movie is the fact that the Back to the Future 3 stars are re-united in the 1800's. There were a few funny moments, however too few. For a comedy, I laughed maybe 2 or 3 times, not enough. Jack really isn't very good at slapstick type of comedy and that is apparent here. His accent was so-so, and it sounded like he tried speaking while holding his nose (nasal). He wasn't the only one holding his nose after this."
2,picture blotchy,"the picture was blotchy and grainy not very clear and kept freezing up, it was not even cd quality very dissapointed."
4,What a great potential...!,"Some very good ideas in this western. Some extremely good situations. Some good suspended situations too. And yet we regret Nicholson is directing himself. He can't see himself when he is acting and that shows tremendously in the film. It explains some slow and long sequences that should have been packed in the acting itself. That explains why the actor Jack Nicholson is too often using some faces and attitudes and gestures that we have already seen in The Shining, in The Witches of Eastwood, or in many other films. He cannot see himself and thus he cannot direct himself properly. And there were and are some extremely potential situations. There could have been, and there should have been.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
4,"Elsie Lee's Washington, D.C. book","This particular book is probably my least favorite of all her books I have read. It starts out more as a love story than a mystery although there is a mystery involving smuggled political information and murder. After you get into the story it does improve but I really didn't like the way this one started out. Still I wouldn't give up this book for anything. I have read most of her books anywhere from 4-5 times each and every time I re-read one I enjoy it as much as the first time I ever read it. I think the main thing I have against this one is it's about women ""trying to get a man"" and that scenario has never been one of my favorites -- it seems sort of demeaning -- a woman is not a woman without a man, but if you can get past this part it's a wonderful mystery, as usual."
3,"like the format, but could be more balanced","This workout is moderately challenging and is in a convenient format.My problem with the workout is that some areas of the body are exercised multiple times, while other parts are completely neglected. For example, the back section only exercises the upper back, while completely neglecting the lower back. The shoulders are excessively worked out, but the outer thighs are never exercised (for another example).Still, you might be able to pair this video with others that exercise the missed muscles. I really like 'Strong Body, Ageless Body' with Erin O'Brien."
5,Fiddle Primer excellent,This fiddle primer book is excellent for beginners. It came with a DVD that I use on my computer to play along and resee sections. Teaches basics how to hold fiddle and bow and moves in a learnable pattern. The book further illustrates all lessons and can be used independently without the DVD.
5,"Finally, a sane approach!","Like many mothers I was constantly vexed by my kids' ear infections and other minor ailments and, worse, by pediatricians who -- despite the fact that they really do know better -- would continually pump my children with antiobiotics. I know how harmful antiobiotic overxposure can be to us all. But I am not the sort of mother who can do nothing when their child is ill. That's why I read MEDICINE MOMS, at the suggestion of a friend. Let me tell you, it was a Godsend. Without preaching or going ""over the top"", this sensible book taught me to trust my instincts, and it helped me learn to use homeopathy to help my kids' bodies combat illness on their own. Read it if you are sick of the Western medicine merry-go-round, or if you just want a great read about one of modern parenthood's dilemmas. If you decide to take its advice, your kids will thank you!"
1,Not The Real Thing,This is not the movie that was in the theaters. This is much shorter and leaves out great bands and substitutes the best parts with filler. Save your money or be prepared to be disappointed.
2,Boz is Long Gone from this film.,"Unfortunately the best part of the original release is NOT on this DVD. Boz Scaggs singing ""I'll Be Long Gone"" was the highlight of this film when it first came out. I sat there slack-jawed as I watched this version and realized that Boz, for what ever reason, has been cut out. Major bummer."
3,"DVD is good, but it is not the full theatrical film.","I waited a year for this dvd to come out. I was expecting the full version I saw in theaters. I was disappointed. The performances on the dvd are good, but a lot of the great performances are missing. There are no performances from Fillmore East. Perhaps the greatest omission is the exclusion of ""Soul Sacrifice"" by Santana. Santana has been knocked for being too cool, too detached. The original band, captured in its full glory and passion, displayed their greatness in ""Soul Sacrifice"". What you saw in ""Woodstock"" pales by comparison."
2,Not much to this.,"There's not much to this Video. Some explantion of how harmonuims work, which was OK. Amateurish production quality. It's basically a guy and his dad who plays harmonium. The father does not speak english. You get to listen to the father play the harmonuim and sing. The son plays percussion. The only thing saving this from getting just one star is there is nothing else out there on harmonuims. Its very expensive for what almost seems like a homemade video."
4,"I NEED HELP WITH WINNING ELEVEN 7, please","Hi, we just bought the game (Winning Eleven 7 for PC) and my husband and I have a lot of concerns. Several players of Manchester United has their names wrong written. The Stadium appears as ""BRATCRICK STADIUM"" or something like that, not like OLD TRAFFORD as it should be. There are clubs with strange unone names. ¿Are all these things normal?. Please help us on this. haradi15@yahoo.com. Chia & Hector"
1,U GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!! THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!,"I was totally amazed with these online reviews with the FAKE propaganda of this being a good(if not best) game, when the truth is that I was sincerely disappointed at it. Its nothing better than WE6, I dont really notice a difference between them, I wanted my money back but they wont accept it, I'll just try to sell it to another person that might like it, cause i'm not playing this, i'm sticking to 989 World Tour Soccer, which in my opinion is the REAL BEST SOCCER game out there."
4,"If you don't like soccer, don't bother","Alright first of all, if you don't like soccer and the strategy involved in soccer, I really wouldn't recommend this game at all, it's about soccer, not arcade soccer but the game of soccerIf however soccer is your sport, and I can safely say it is for me, then this is THE game for you, it has everything from realistic moves to a realistic build-up of play. The players (with the exception of the Dutch players and some others) are all represented perfectly, David Beckham even has his little ponytail that he has now.Two things, I always change the controls seeing as I don't believe the default controls are very comfortable, and I recommend everyone downloading updates available (roster-updates, these are available through a Sharkport Device) because otherwise you will still find David Seaman guarding the posts at ArsenalOverall if you like soccer, get this game, you will NOT regret it"
1,CD from Smokey Mountain,"I purchased the CD ""The Best of Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians"" as a gift for my aging parents who used to love listening to those albums. However, the CD arrived with a damaged cover and I'm afraid to open it or give it to my parents because the CD might be broken. i read the return policy, and they not only make you pay for shipping, but also charge you a 15% restocking fee. So now, I don't know what to do. I'm looking at this unopened damaged package thinking, ""What recourse do i have???"" It was damaged somehow in transit and looks as if I'm getting stuck with it. I'm sure the music would have sounded good, but I'm afraid to open it because I'm still pondering what to do."
3,Why?,"As far as I can tell, the only time one of these lame ""Millennium"" collections is needed, is when there are no collections for an artist. Guess what, Jimi has numerous hits albums out, and they're almost all better. Not to mention his original albums. Obviously these songs are classic, and the remastering is nice, but at only 10 tracks, there's easily another 10 missing? Please get the 20 track ""Experience Hendrix"", the old ""Ultimate Experience"", or his 2-disc best of before this. However, even a little Hendrix is better than none."
5,The best book I have read on raising children.,"Dr, Mac Kenzie simply states many difficulties parents have in dealing with their children and offers concrete, practical suggestions to alleviate these situations. His well-organized book is easy to read. A comprehensive index makes the book a must-have reference."
3,hollywood,A little dissapointed that this product didn't come with any hard ware. I believe the brackets will be great once I find hard ware to actually install them.
3,Not nearly as bad as the critics said!,"Madonna and her husband must have really stepped on some wrong toes to warrant such an incredibly undeserved public lashing. I can't imagine why so many critics jumped on the bandwagon. While wathcing this movie, I asked myself ""did the critics even WATCH the movie?""While I will admit that Madonna is no Meryl Streep, this is certainly not her worst performance, and at times, she performs the best she ever has, especially halfway into the movie and towards the end. In the beginning, she is a bit wooden, but I think part of that was an intentional reflection of the character.I found myself laughing at many scenes in the movie, and emotionally moved in others. Other than the corny line that Madonna speaks into the phone towards the end (""my darling""), I did not see much wrong with this movie. I would have to say that I enjoyed watching it.It's a hell of a lot better than The Next Best Thing!"
4,I saw Swept Away in the theatres,I was one of the lucky few to see Swept Away during it's brief run in the theatres. Madonna did an excellent job in the role of Amber. Anyone who is a true Madonna fan knows by now that she is not the best actress. But she put out one of her best performances to date in this role. It's sad that all the critics and their rumors were about to keep this movie from being widely released and seen by more people. This movie is a must see for any Madonna fan.
1,"terrible ""romance"" movie","I cant believe this is under the ""romance"" section, what a terrible movie. I was prepared for Madonna's rude performance, but I was not prepaired for the horrible, abusive attitude of the italian. Worste ""romance"" movie I've EVER seen."
1,One Star Because it's Madonna.,"As much as I admire Guy Ritchie's work, it's been painfully obvious for many years that Madonna cannot act and only manages to secure roles because... well because she's Madonna. And now that Guy is her significant other we knew she would end up in one of his films sooner or later. Let's just hope this over-rated starlet doesn't mar another of Ritchie's works. Memo to Madonna... drop that phony British accent and stick to what you do best - recording shallow and generic pop songs."
2,"Clocks, not culture","This review will be like the book: short and to the point.While there is a lot about the development of clockwork in the time period, there seems to be very little about how clocks and timekeeping devices actually shaped the culture of the time. This deficiency disappointed me."
1,Polaroid No Longer Manufactures Film!,"While some stock still remains of the film, it is an absolute fact that Polaroid stopped manufacturing it several months ago. Current stock of film will last no more than a year. If you want a great instant camera get the Fuji Instax mini or Instax 200. Cheaper price, far superior quality. And you won't have to worry about getting film later."
2,for the excessively well-to-do & the ecologically oblivious,"1.film expensive for a blue-collar workerat a dollar per picture you had better not make mistakes2.film difficult or well-nigh impossible to getexcept online from you-know-who: amazonshipping fee added to net cost of film unless you splurge3.the whole thing weighs almost a poundyes, you CAN lug it around, but WILL you?4.not submersiblenot sand-proofnot slam-dunk proofnot Janet Reno proofnot recyclable when the planned obsolescence kicks in5.further ammunition to-render your functionally illiterate offspring MORE so-implicate uniformed and secret police in untorward acts-put your local minimum-wage photofinisher employee out of work"
5,Quality product.,"The product has quite good quality (I was surprised) for it's price. Looks like a genuine knock-off. Great for photo-shoots: the material doesn't look cheap, and the sword even feels good to the touch... I'm not qualified to comment on the balance of the sword, but it feels quite comfortable to hold in any position."
2,it is okay,"Just got a new computer with a sweet graphics card and was excited to get some games. Bang! Gunship Elite said it requires 3D hardware acceleration so I thought I'd give it a shot and bought it after some debate. I was very disappointed. The graphics are fairly good, but I couldn't even beat the first mission as my weapons simply bounced off the hull of the enemy ship. The manual lends little help. You can skip this one."
4,Good buy,"Well the quality of cloth is good, and so is the design. But the size looked little bigger in the provided pictures (just perception issues I guess)/Overall a good buy."
5,Incredible!,"There are no words to describe what Dj Kawasaki does in this (the new, ""Beautiful Too"") and in the past album ""Beautiful"". Perfectly blended house rhythms with soulful punch, Dj Kawasaki will make your life better if you really enjoy house music, not the progressive, and trance trash, but the fine and luxurious essence of this music we all enjoy.If you are looking for some new good music, here's the cd you need to have in your hands."
5,A Jazzed Up Murder,"As a mystery writer with my first novel in initial release, I genuinely enjoyed Bill Moody's BIRD LIVES. In this novel, Evan Horne would like to concentrate on his musical comeback, but the Feds have different plans. The FBI convinces Horne to solve a strange series of murders. Someone is killing off ""smooth"" jazz musicians. All right, so those folks perhaps ought to die, but Horne needs to catch the killer anyway. BIRD LIVES is a great book about the jazz community, and it is also a well-written mystery. It is most enjoyable."
5,Major contribution and still relevant after decades,"Since its first publication in 1960, the strategy of Conflict is still relevant today. His concepts of strategic moves and random strategy can still be applied to the increasing complicated international affairs. It's definitely a timeless classic for game theoretical study of international relations."
2,VIncent D'Onofrio saved this movie from getting 1 star,"I found Claire Dolan to be a bleak, sad and depressing portrayal of a woman trying to earn money to may off a debt by selling herself to wealthy business men. Not only did Katrin Cartlidge (Claire Dolan) not have any depth to her role, but I found her terribly unappealing. She only had one facial expression through out the entire movie, even when she was having sex. She showed no feeling or emotion. Granted, some of the dullness to her character was due to her role, but it seemed as though there was nothing underneath.Vincent D'Onofrio was the saving grace of this film, playing Claire's love and pseudo-savior. He carried the entire cast, along with the very talented Colm Meaney. This movie is an OK choice for any fan of Mr. D'Onofrio's, but other than that, i found the film to be very boring and slow moving."
2,Heavy Shoe,"This is a heavy clog and the insert is somewhat slippery. The clog seems mostly true to size, maybe slightly wide, looks very nice, but I find that I would need to wear athletic socks to stabilize my foot in the shoe. The arch support is too high/hard for my feet, and my foot slides forward, making for an unstable walk, almost losing the weighty shoe, so I really haven't worn them. Everyone's feet are different, so this is just my personal opinion."
4,From spoiled and pampered brat to warrior!,"Katrina Wellington wanted to marry a marquess, but needed the approval of her uncle, since she was not of age to receive her inheritance. The uncle insisted she and her fiance must travel to the Northwest Territory to meet him first. They agreed.White Eagle joined them for the end of the journey. Sparkes immediately blazed between Katrina and White Eagle. Katrina was known as Shines Like Moonlight until age five. At that age, her parents were killed in a flood and the uncle sent Katrina to New York as her father had wished.Moonlight had returned as a spoiled, pampered, determined, brave, and passionate woman. White Eagle set out to claim her for his own. First there was the marquess to deal with. Then they must rescue the uncle from another tribe.***Ahhh, very romantic! Oh, how I enjoyed watching Moonlight and White Eagle go head-to-head. (I have hope that the maid, Rebecca, will receive her own story.) Very entertaining and good plot.***"
5,was a GREAT read!,"This was a really good story line, with great background,characters, and intimacy!!! I love Karen Kay's stories. I have bought several of her books and none have disappointed me!!! I love historical romance novels/stories."
3,Fun....then annoying,"Our son really loves to play with this toy. It's bright colored and is challenging. But after some time he just started to stuff other toys in the elephant's trunk which inevitably got stuck. This would cause him to become very frustrated. Of course, once I remove the obstruction, he jams it in there again. This is now our least favorite toy :)"
2,Elephany shape sorter,Not to entertaining put the blocks in the same shape and color and then you're supposed to press the ears down and they're supposed to slide out the trunk but you dont even push the ears down and they come out my daughter has more fun with the blocks alone then the whole toy itself
5,Great Book for a History Buff on his Birthday,This book is a great book for anyone that likes History and would like to see History on their Birthyear. Great Product.
1,Not a Good Buy,These are cute pants and the material is nice. These run to small and the returning them was not economical.
3,Helpful if you don't know that much about the illness,"I have been living with bipolar illness for several years, so I'm already pretty familiar with most of the information. The books that are written about depression are primarily by doctors, so I was looking for a someone to write a book on their life with manic depressive illness. This book attempts to be a reference guide, similar to a medical text. I got the feeling that the book was written in a hurry, and that they wanted to make the book thicker then it is, so they increased the font and added a lot of white space.If you are suffering from this illness, I doubt this book will be very helpful, you probably know everything in it. However, if you know someone that is bipolar and want to learn more, this book is probably very good. Thats the only reason why I give it 3 stars."
4,Tivoli Sirius Satellite Radio Receiver,"This is an amazing and highly satisfactory product; the sound quality is very good indeed especially with instalation (optional) of a companion speaker.My only recommendation for change would be for the manufacturer to enable the remote control to ""power on/off"" and to ""adjust volume""."
3,Tivoli Does not Support this Product,"I have had this radio for more than four years and was extremely satisfied with both the quality of sound and appearance and would have given it 5 stars. Recently, I have had to press the ""on"" button at least 20 times to get the radio to turn on. It may be a tuner or amp problem. However, when I called Tivoli, I was told they do not repair this radio and told me that it wasn't worth repairing(verbatim quote!) In other words, there is no SUPPORT for this product. Given the price of this item, you would think that this company would offer repair service or have some sort of referral information. Since I have Sirius on my iPhone/iPad2 and Laptop, I can access Sirius, Pandora, Stitcher et al. So, when the Tivoli set finally conks out, I will trash it and make a note never to buy any of their products again"
3,A disappointment,"I bought this because I was about to subscribe to Sirius and wanted an alarm clock that would wake me to Sirius programming.When I got this radio (which is visually beautiful) I was disappointed to learn that although there is an alarm, there is no ""snooze"" feature as I've seen it in every clock radio I've ever seen. There is something they call ""snooze"" but that manually turns the radio on for a set time and then it goes off - the opposite of what I wanted, which was 10 minutes of quiet and then the radio again.This radio is also a bit expensive - which of course I knew, but still, without the features I'd hoped for it's a bit hard to swallow."
1,Hate-filled,"This book is filled with distortions, exaggerations, outright lies, and hateful vitriol for anyone who does not support her extremist right-wing ideology. She does not recognize the Constitutional right for Americans to differ on opinion and contends that anyone who does not follow her narrow vision of patriotism should be labeled as a 'traitor'. There is so much hate in this book it should give any person of faith, or good-natured American for that matter, reason to pause and consider how the Republican party has changed in recent years. Ronald Reagan must be turning in his grave."
5,Liberal cry-babies will hate this book,"I just finished the book and it is better than I expected. I highly recommend it.The last year the communists ran a presidential candidate was 1948. Where did all the communists go? They went to the Democrat party, of course. In the last half of the twentieth century, the Democrats passed into law every single party platform that the communist party proposed from the first half of the twentieth century.The book is a mini history book, which corrects much of the modern mythology of the twentieth century. Liberals will hate it because it presents direct evidence that destroys their dogmatic beliefs.Perhaps if a liberal has an open mind and chooses to do his or her own reasearch, they might find out that their dogmatic beliefs are wrong, but I haven't found any liberals that have open minds."
1,Mistaking Dissent for Treason,"When children are told 'no' they have tantrums. That's very similar to Coulter's attitude in this book.Dissent is not treason and should not be mistaken for such. Honest disagreement with our government is as much in our role as Americans as is our loyalty to its causes...and when we disagree, we should take action at the ballot box or the editorial page.If this were not so, we'd still be British Citizens. (Long Live the King!)I'll support Coulter's right to be a loudmouth if she'll support mine."
1,Lying is not journalism,"This book is simply a pack of falsifications and lies. I don't mind a person's politics as long as they tell the truth, but this is just a silly, ugly, and hateful book. Too much of conservative ""thought"" is just hate thinly disguised as thought."
1,Are you effing serious?,"Ann Coulter is completely midtown. And, if you don't know what that means, so are you. ('You,' of course, meaning those constituting this [intellectually challenged] authorial audience, the flipside to the otherness that is the rest of the thinking world).But seriously - liberal, conservative, socialist, fascist, racist, neo-nazi, et al - it doesn't matter: this book is an insult to anyone who considers her/him/itself to be a decently intelligent and discriminating reader, regardless of you particular response to the content...."
1,Liberals & moderates: READ THIS BOOK,"Clearly, this mean-spirited, poorly written and pathetically researched trash is meant only for the brain-dead far right. However, it is important that everyone be aware of what is being written and read. Those who ignored Mein Kampf or laughed it off as the rant of a weirdo lived to regret thinking that. Take this crap seriously people. Be aware of what is going on and how twisted people can be. History shows how lies of this nature can take hold no matter how ridiculous they are to rational thinking people. Unfortunately, far too many people believe the garbage spewed in here. Watch out. Be informed. Be careful. Don't let garbage like this go unchallenged. And don't ignore it."
2,I don't think she does her cause any good,"Sadly, I don't think Ann Coulter does her cause any good - I rather agree with the Catherwood review below, that other conservatives do a better job. Read the Weekly Standard - reading Coulter is enough to turn anyone into a liberal!"
2,Now I know why...,"Now I know why my wife left me, became a lesbian, and ate our children. Thanks for explaining it, Ann."
1,Howlers.,"Ann Coulter once again shows the world that she is, indeed, insane.Well that, or she is very good at manipulating her image. She simultaneously presents a rabid, fundamentalist view that appeals to the more base instincts of the intellectually challenged Right Wing, which also must be read by real intellectuals. She provides a perfect picture of martyrdom and hysteria, painting a picture of the evils the left has perpetrated throughout history, while disregarding the fact that the left is almost always correct.It's safe to say that in 40 years people will remember Coulter. Not for being pretty. Not for being brilliant. Not for being correct. She will be remembered for being among the last bastions of rabid intolerance that our nation tries so hard to shake free."
1,Laming of the Shrew,"I guess if you're into the unconscionably ridiculous rantings of a complete harpy, this book is for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest trying something from the non-fiction section."
2,PHWAAAAAAP!!!! THWWUUUNK!!,"I admit it, I am a liberal democrat. What people like Ann Coulter do not understand is that I live with my mom, play video games all day, and would not read a book even if I was out of weed! My opinions are right because they are based on MY feelings. So I don't need any actual information!PHWAAAAAAP! Woah! That was the sound of my head popping out of my large rear end! I used a shoehorn, lots of axle grease, and a copy of Treason. Believe me, the only thing this stupid book is good for is pulling your head out of your rear end. Now I'm starting to freak!!!Help!!!! Mom!!! Clinton!!!! Someone!!! Help me put my head back in!!!! HURRY!!! Before I choose reason over my irrational, uninformed feelings!!!! THWWUUUNK!!! (muffled) That's better. Warm and moist, again. Comfy-cozy. Thanks Al Franken and Bill Maher. Now, I'm ready to criticize that stupid right wing again!!!!"
1,Pissing In The Wind,"As a member of the Republican party for over 20 years, I am embarrassed by this woman's writing. We're not all blonde cheerleaders. We don't all blame everything on the liberals. In fact, this very book just may have converted me over to ""the other side."" It made me realize something very important that most of my peers and colleagues fail to look back and recognize:Critical thought and radical dissent against the authority is what gave birth to the freedom of this very nation.Ann Coulter is just pissing in the wind, and if you believe everything you read in the mass media, you're just standing under her with your mouth wide open.Mindless conformity did not."
4,A Real Education,"My jaw dropped and didn't close (figuratively speaking) through the first 5 chapters of this book. If you read this and really reflect on what you're reading, you'll realize that Ms Coulter has nailed it. Just think about how our country and our government has changed in the past 60 yrs. It really isn't your father's Democratic party. What liberals lack these days is the Can-Do attitude that made this country the destination of those who who are willing to work however hard it takes to succeed. Of course not every liberal Democrat is anti-American, but you have to admit that a lot of what goes on makes sense in view of what Ms Coulter has written."
1,Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism,"Al Franken says it best, Ann Coulter: Nutcase. I would recommend, reading Lies by AL Franken."
1,"Wow, who knew history could get this twisted?","It's sad to think about the fact that Ms. Coulter can't quite get past this need to take historical facts and move them around to make her point. Democrats were on the House Un-American Activities Commission too, not that most people concerned with making sure that they yell louder than everyone else so that we all know that they're right and anyone who disagrees with them hates America wants to remember that. Most Democrats today probably don't want to think about that either. But Ms. Coulter's just too strident to ignore, and her book is too screwy to ignore either. Read this if you've ever wanted to realize why Fox News has to speak in words with less than 3 syllables."
1,Talib-Ann Coulter lies,"First, I'd like to inform Ms. Talib-Ann Coulter and her ditto heads, that our nation was founded as a Western ""Liberal"" Democracy.Secondly, Joseph McCarthy, with his ""un-American activity"" witch-hunts, that denied his victims the right to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,"" would not have been out of place in the old Soviet Kremlin.Thirdly, as a ""Liberal"" Democrat , I volunteerd to serve my country, so does that make me more of a patriot than the ultra- hawks (chicken hawks?) Hannity, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, et al, who were too good to serve their country?Fourthly, Talib-Ann claims that Liberals have brought political discourse down to the level of professional wrestling. Just reading her screed/blather proves otherwise.Don't waste your money; instead, read Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liars..."" He exposes Talib-Ann for the liar she is."
1,"Garbage in, garbage out -","Every flag-draped 'patriot' needs to read the chapter in Franken's book on how these attack dogs assemble and use their 'facts.' It won't change your mind, but at least you'll know the true colors of America's new conservative media and literary heroes.The only thing anyone might find scary about 'Treason' and reptiles like Coulter is how many people they're actually fooling.I understand Hannity's book is actually rated softer when perforated and put on a roll."
1,The liberals are still right,"It may well be true that liberals side with the United States' enemies. If this is the case, it is in fact their greatest virtue. In a recent radio interview, George Monbiot, author of *The Age of Consent* claimed that the United States now a threat to everyone, including the other developed nations. Very few other nation-states start wars with such alacrity, and none posess collections of weapons of mass destruction to rival the US. Since the Second World War, the US has shaped other nations to serve its commercial interests by bullying, covert operations, and outright military assault. It deserves to be recognised that it has long since abandoned true advocacy of the Enlightenment ideals of its founding fathers. The contemporary US deserves contempt, and I give it readily. Traitors, I salute you!"
1,Commies under the bed!,"This book is aimed at people who think there are still commies under the bed, even today! Annie does a great service for the right wing by distracting her readers from the real issues. You wouldn't know from this book that there is a big difference between a totalitarian state -- which tells you where to live, how to work, even what to think -- and the social safety net, which is a democratic society's decision, through the ballot box, to protect vulnerable groups like seniors. But Annie's readers are so busy fighting the Cold War that they don't stop to wonder whether the Bushies are really right to dismantle social services, for example by privatizing Social Security or Medicare."
2,I'm going to turn myself into the nearest Gulag!,"After reading about half of this novel I decided that I must be the most treasonist person in the world. Afterall, I voted for democrats! At least I now know that McCarthy was simply ""misunderstood."" Didn't she also say that about Hitler?I would have given it 1 star, but I think Coulter does wonders for the Democratic party. The ""GOP"" needs more like her!"
1,I would like to give this book a rating of 0 stars!!!!!,Ann attempts to portray all non-conservatives as traitors. I believe this book will never enlighten people. It will only feed into the hatred and fear that lives in the hearts of her readers.
1,Revisionist history,This is the most revisionist history book ever written. To suggest that Senator McCarty was a patriotic and decent man is egregious treason. Do not waste your money.
5,Treason,"Reading this book provides insight into Ann Coulter's character and why she is the way she is.It is a wonderful book that Conservatives will greatly enjoy. The primary reader, however - should be Liberals. Coulter's insights will open their eyes to the ideology they have embraced, force them to question their long held beliefs and perhaps, allow them to reassess their political leanings.This book cannot be compared to such ideological writings as Michael Moore's Stupid White Men. Coulter backs up every statement with facts and provides the sources for her information. This is an honest, clear and concise, often humorous look at Liberals in America since the FDR administration.Joseph McCarthy will never be viewed in the same light."
1,Frantic fearful faschick,"I used to wonder about these ""save America now or next minute we die"" people: why are they so over the top? Now I attribute it to two sources. The first is pure opportunistic marketing: if I don't convince you there's an immediate crisis, I won't really get your attention and dollars. That's Coulter all over.The second source, applicable to conservatives of good faith, is more interesting. They actually have little confidence in the value of the values they trumpet. They don't believe that liberal democracy and publicly-moderated capitalism are so much better than the alternatives, and they don't believe that people are smart enough to notice the difference.Given how the Cold War came out, what could justify this amazing lack of faith?"
1,Coulter is a racist hatemonger,"""Savage Oriental beasts""? The ""yellow peril"" died about sixty years ago. Coulter is nothing but a racist, anti-Muslim verbal terrorist who was screaming on a street corner until somebody pitied her and gave her a typewriter. I'm taking a survey on what the ""H"" in her name means: I say either ""hatemonger"", ""hellbeast"", ""hawk"" or ""Hitler""."
3,Okay.,"I'm going to say the same thing about this book that I say about all political type books, and that is, you can hear most of these people on TV show's, or radio programs and already know what most of their opinions are going to be in books that they write, so if you agree with them when you see them on TV or wherever, you will like the book, if you hate their opinions, you will hate the book. For me the book was okay, but kind of boring."
1,A yawn-fest.,I tried to read this and got bored after about fifty pages. Guess I don't quite get it. Not much to recommend here.
5,Treason is Shocking,"Treason is a shocking sarcastic account of the debacle of the Democrat's values and inaction. It will cause one to seriously change their political party membership. The author is a leading conservative intellectual who clarifies what really happened to Joseph McCarthy, Whittaker Chambers, Alger Hess, and Ronald Reagan. She has done extensive ressearch, having 46 pages of notes in her book. After reading Ann Coulter's book, I feel much more informed about our political parties and what they stand for. It was extremely interesting."
1,sheesh.,"this book truly is awful; not just because i disagree with every single thing that ann coulter has to say, but also because her research is nothing more than quotes plucked fom various sources that back up coulter's point of view. if she could actually prove anything she claims as truth - i.e. that protesting wars makes a person treasonous, or that all liberals really do hate america - i'd be more willing to take her seriously, even if i still disagreed with her. but as it is, this is really just one huge editorial masquerading as truth. it's all well and good for people to write their opinions, but don't pretend that it's actually fact.and since when did supporting the seperation of church and state make anyone treasonous? i guess this means thomas jefferson was a traitor, too."
1,Hmmmmm...Sophistry.,"This is a set of pre-fabricated thoughts for people who believe that spouting this stuff makes them look intelligent. The ironic thing is that *they* are the ones most likely to lose jobs, money, and security because of this kind of book...what *else* is the reason for such propaganda? It makes those most likely to be hurt by the positions accept (even support) the very arguments that they wouldn't consent to if they really understood what was being said."
1,Imagine There Was No Ann Coulter,"A regrettably venomous book not worth wasting your time on. Joe McCarthy was good, liberals are evil, the Clintons are eviler. Factual ""inconsistences"" (read: lies) abound, and everything must be sacrificed to the greater goal of blaming liberals for everything from her hangnails to the Iran-Contra scandal."
1,Ann's research isn't research.,"Ann has bragged many times about her huge number of ""footnotes"" (by which she means endnotes.) But if you actually looked at how Ann comes up with some of her facts instead of allowing her to spoon-feed her ideas to you, you could see her intentional deceit. When trying to claim that there were only X number of articles on some news story, she uses LexisNexis searches to justify her claim. Fair, right? Wrong! Let's say she wants to search for Bush's state of the union speech. If she wants to show some point about how ""the liberal media"" did not cover the event enough, instead of searching for ""Bush"" and ""State of the Union,"" she might search for ""Bush"" and ""State of the Union address"" and ""war on terrorism"" and ""economy"" and ""any other word that will limit the number of results."" Don't let her get away with such treachery."
1,Wasted an entire week,"My parents had this book, so I read it while visiting them for a week. Then, because of all the uproar over whether it's the truth or not, I decided to check footnotes on the internet. I checked 50 of the references she used to give ""facts"" in the book, and 49 of them were either wrong, misquoted, or downright lies. Unfortunately, the only conclusion I can come to is this is the type of ""writing"" that, while it appeals to the Jerry Springer-esque crowd, is dangerous and inciting. This book should be read as fiction, since most of it is simply made up."
1,Republican Traitors,"The biggest piece of political propoganda that I have ever seen. What I really love is that as I am reading this I am glancing up at CNN reporting that the Bush administration has exposed a CIA operative. Whatever Ann says, her acusations of the Democratic party aren't treason. Exposing a CIA operative is. Just hope that Bush is also put through an impeachment hearing over this (The *true* definition of ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"")"
1,Double Standard,"Ann Coulter is an anti-Muslim and an anti-Arab.If she tried to publish an anti-semitic book it would never jive. And rightfully so of course. Any type of ignorant, blatant hatred is stupid.Here is her brilliant ""defining"" quote referring to Arabs:""we should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.""Terrorists do NOT define what Islam is. Nor do the more than one billion Muslims around the world who are not terrorists. The book was closed on what Islam is the day that Mohammad died. Regardless of what you believe, the truth of the matter is that Mohammad was a human being who had a lot of good qualities. He was pro-women before anyone was pro-women, he accepted peoples rights to freedom of religion when there was no such thing and always taught Muslims to respect Jews and Christians explicitly. These are irrefutable facts.If some people who today call themselves Muslims do not live this way, don't blame it on Islam."
1,What a Shame,"The ranking of this book on the Best Sellers list is an unfortunate example of the current political climate. Conservatives, especially the far right, use ad hominem attacks against liberals, whilst liberals debate the issues, and the ideas behind them. Coulter reduces everything to simplistic, good vs evil dimensions. Does this remind one of a high-ranking official living in the White House? Something very, verrry, verrrrrry BAD happened to this woman. One can't be as hateful, as deceitful as she is without some prior personally-warping event. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Coulter is clearly a very bright person. Boy-o-boy, talk about misdirecting one's talents.....what a shame....what a waste."
3,Good but not good enough!,"I found Coulter's book to be really interestingl. The only problem I found is that she tends to label a bit much, without looking enough at her own party. Her case against the Clintons is for the most part correct, but a little over-done. I understand she wants to get her point accross but one could argue that a few wrongdoings from the Bush clan could be labeled as (...) . This book was insightful on what goes on in the congress that the liberal media never tells us. It really makes you wonder by Bill O'Reiley's book ""Who's looking out for you?"" Anyways, If you want a book with a more right-wing slant check this out. Otherwise I'd reccomend Tammy Bruce instead. She is a little more fair and balanced ( can i say that? LOL)."
5,She's nailed them!,"Ann Coulter's acid wit and sarcasm provide the perfect spice for this terrific history of the left's unbelieveable ignorance, incompetence, deception and outright lies. The left have been wrong about our enemies from Stalin through Osama bin Laden, and wrong about our heroes, including the man who won the Cold War, Ronald Reagan. She also makes it clear that Sen. Joseph McCarthy was right - there were scores of US Government employees on the Soviet payroll, but the left were more concerned about destroying McCarthy than facing the truth. Coulter includes footnotes for all her quotes, so the left are exposed as ""traitors"" by their own words, and by the decoded KGB tapes - the Venona Project. Liberals will not like this book, but for those interested in the facts, Ann Coulter nails them."
1,Thumbs down from a conservative,"There are of course strong arguments to support the conservative arguments on issues from defense policy, to personal responsibility, to economics. Unfortunately, Coulter is either not capable, or not interested in making them. She's mastered the art of grabbing headlines and selling books, and clearly has decided to disregard anything remotely resembling actual facts. Her reckless disregard for truth and resoned argument in favor of a ridiculous excuse for logic do damage to the very causes she claims to support. I can tell you from personal experience that behind closed doors even conservatives laugh at what she has so successfully sold as truth to the American public."
1,One for the bathroom,"Well she's got conviction so she can have a star. Not an easy read: like being harangued by a kitten-heeled self righteous drunk. But if you just let it wash over you it can become genuinely amusing. However, it's hard to believe that such a fevered & maniacal rant passes for a contribution to contemporary discourse. Unsure why you all find her quite so scary when her MO is to wind you up. That said I am 3000 miles away. Thankfully. File under fiction-fantasy."
1,Scary,"I used to think Ann Coulter had some valid, well thought-out ideas to improve the every day lives of American citizens. However, after reading her book I have come to the conclusion that she is delusional and border-line loco. This book is filled with half-truths and outright lies. I hope that people who read her claims research them on their own before believing her stories. When she gives interviews or participates in discussions, one gets a sense that she is rather full of herself. She thinks she knows it all, but she does not (I don't think anyone really does). Ann Coulter's ideas are scary. If half of what she preaches was practiced, I fear for the future of this country. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Where are the reviews? One star too many,"I find it intersting that the only ""review"" listed under editorial reviews is the one off the books jacket. How nice for Miss Coulter that she can review herself and be assured of a glowing assessment. However, simply calling oneself an intellectual and stating that anyone who believes otherwise is a traitor, doesn't make it so. Miss Coulter is living in a world of fantasy where she makes up the facts and by doing so makes them real. Her type of rhetoric is what divides this country, making it near impossible to move forward on any issue, regardless of one's relative ""conservativeness."" The author so polarizes the citizenery with her over-ripe rhetoric, that she puts everyone in an either or catagory; either you agree with her or you're a traitor. If anything, this kind of idealogically circular thinking is what is truly traitorous. Hello fascism, goodbye democracy. Dissent is verbooten!"
5,Shrieks from the guilty...,"When an innocent person is accused of something, that person tends to adamantly and steadfastly maintain his or her innocence. When a guilty person is accused, the shrieking begins in earnest. Attacking the accusers is a staple of this intellectual diet (read: starvation plan), and Coulter's (as well as McCarthy's) critics are proving on this collection of reviews even now.The book is excellent (albiet too short). Read this impeccably researched tome for yourself, and make up your own mind. Conservatives actually seem to trust people to do this, and will politely remain silent while you do so. Try to avoid leftists however, as their guilty shrieking might be somewhat distracting."
1,No brainer! She's Nuts!,"A human being can be this simple minded..A piece of garbage.Definately misleading and very dangerouse book for no brainersand non thinkers.Girl, world is more complex than that.Do some researches when u write next time and don't ramble onwhat u think is the fact but try to write on what u actually know is for a fact.Nuts..."
3,It is shameful,"Ann should be ashamed of herself for writing such a biased book. If you do not agree this is a biased book, you should do a little statistics of the stars Ann has received from each review. You will find:About 50% of the reviews give her 5 stars.About the other half give her 1 star.How divided is this?By the way, Ann has the right to say about whatever she likes to say."
1,Essential reading for all national socialists!,Essential reading for all National Socialists along with Mein Kampf.
1,sort of a sad book,"I am a ""conservative"" and tried to like this book but it was nearly impossible. She is not so much an author as a political operative who has done nothing to increase our understanding of what she is talking about."
1,Don't Co-Enable Her,"Coulter obviously makes a pretty good living making up lies and spouting them on TV. But although it may be good for Ann (and her publisher, and the ratings of her friends at Fox), turning political discourse into mud wrestling isn't good for the rest of us. She may be fun to read in a rubbernecking-at-a-freeway-pileup sort of way, but don't co-enable this shameless exhibitionist or reward her by spending money on her garbage. Think for yourself."
1,A Fictional Hate Novel,"A poorly written fictional novel, from a dillusional, paranoid, schizophrenic, lunatic."
1,Just think for a minute:,"The most crazed religious fanatic argues in more calm and reasoned tones than liberalsEven Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals doJoe McCarthy and his fanaticism never hurt anyoneThese are all Coulter quotes and statements. My simple question: How could anyone with a working brain in their head accept tripe like that as gospel? That alone speaks volumes -- all of them negative -- about her supporters. So liberals hate the US more than Osama and his band of lackeys. Sure, Anne. THERE's a responsible statement. Jerry Falwell, who blamed 9/11 on gays, is calmer than most liberals. There's another one. If the liberals are making this country so intolerable for you and your legions of followers, Anne, you could always permanently relocate. Afghanistan is nice."
1,Same Old Rhetoric,"As a Bush Supporter I expected to read a book that explored the shortfalls of democrats and the accomplishments made by the republican party. I did not, however, expect to be introduced to the one single person that is probably most detrimental to the party. Ann Coulter is just over-the-top, with obvious smear tactics she takes things out of context and just plain lies half the time. This book could do real damage if a political novice were to read it. They might believe what she is saying if they didn't know any better. An embarrasment to republicans; the lowest of the low."
1,Off the deep end and without any factual content,"Ann has gone off the deep end this time. This book is full of obviously contrived diatribes and falsehoods, and general lunacy. it's a good read if you're grounded and in the mood for humorous fiction. Gee whiz Ann, you've lost me."
2,"Insane, but funny.","This woman is the Kim Jong Il of American publishing. She will say absolutely anything to get attention, and it's obviously working. Insanity is lucrative these days.I expect her next heavily (if inaccurately) footnoted work will be an enthusiastic defense of Joseph Goebbels. ""He wasn't such a bad guy!""The woman certainly knows how to channel a raving lunatic. Bonus star for being so funny."
1,Liberals Hate Freedom?,"So, Ann, liberals hate freedom, hunh? Which freedoms might those be? Freedom of choice? Freedom of religion? Yeah, so many liberals just hate those, don't they :-)If that weren't funny enough, now she says the Democratic party should be dissolved. Seems to me she is the one who hates freedom, since she wants to take away the right for so many to be free to choose which party they belong to. You know, honey, getting rid of everyone who disagrees with you won't make you any better."
2,Conservative Lawyer ?,"There is no such animal as a politically conservative lawyer, such as the author alleges to be. The recent anti-liberal propoganda is allowing many to make money for the pontificating media types. I am an ultra conservative and have been long before the marketing genius of Murdock and the Fox news channel.The author alleges to be a loyal conservative citizen in her public life yet, her actions in her private life associations would dictate otherwise. All citizens need to critically analyze any and all data given them regardless of who or what is presenting the alleged facts.Save your money for some real education or enlightening material. Remember, believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see. Do your own research for the facts regarding any subject don't look to buy knowledge from authors like, Goldberg, Michael Moore,Miller,Coulter, etc...America is a great country because of independant thought and the freedom to choose."
2,Buy the paperback version,I would reccomend conservative readers to purchace the print version of this book as the audio book version is hard to hear the narrative over the screaming ghosts that come out of Ann Coulter's Mouth when she speaks.

2,HAHAHAHA GOOD TIMES,"I'm an independent you see. I could care less about the republican party or democratic party so I wasn't biased when I picked up this book. But boy was this one ""funny"" book! I couldn't get enough it. It was sooo orgasmic. But after reading it for a hundred pages I gave up because I realized that this book was as factual as the Onion. How can I believe somebody when they spend most of the time accusing people of somehow being ""commies"" and ""traitors"" when most of these people are just expressing their opinions that might not fit a conservative's ideas. I'll start believing in Ann Coulter and many other popular right wingers when they start behaving more like adults with a little more common sense. The only reason why I gave this book a two instead of a one is because Ann Coulter looks sooo very sexy in that picture and I loooove the fine texture of the book's pages."
5,Why do they hate so much?,"I have just finished this book and find it a glaring spotlight on the fallacies that have been foisted on us through the years. I was one of those duped back in the 60s and 70s by the Left (I even voted for McGovern), but the more I read and the more I study, the perniciousness of the liberal falsehoods continue to amaze me.Some of the critics of Ms. Coulter follow her criticisms of the Left to the letter, either by attacking her personality, or by saying how Hillary's book (written by ghostwriters BTW) is more congenial. I'm sure Ms. Coulter would love to be congenial, but her critics would discredit her as just ""another addleheaded woman.""There are people critizing the people that read her books as flunkies and stupid (as they did to President Reagan). ........Thank you Ms. Coulter for exposing the travesties of the Left."
1,bird cage liner,this piece of dong is not fit to wipe my back end. Full of lies. I would not burn this book to start a fire to cook food for my starving children for fear of the poison that would burn off of the pages!
5,Ann Coulter hits the nail on the head!,"Once again, Ann Coulter skewers the far right in this hilarious parody of conservatism run amok. Ann comes out guns blazing, in a satirical defense of one of America's civil rights shams, and in doing so she reminds us of the consequences that we all face when a society leans too far from the political center. A must read for all liberals and rational conservatives."
1,A Betrayal Indeed -- Of Your Intelligence,"While Ms. Coulter's defenders will find here her usual deft jabs, most of the knife-work here is to the back. Trying to redeem McCarthyism as a positive endeavor ignores practically the entire historical record of the 1940s and 1950s -- but it is revealing, in that it shows how today's conservative agenda bypasses defense of substance for defense of character assassination. In her last book Coulter painted that as a liberal trait; perhaps it is. But if solely so, then Coulter must be a liberal."
2,I am a big fan of Anne,"Ann was speaking once in front of the annual National Review meeting on McCarthyism, morality, and taxation. She and I made eye-contact and she sent a delegate into the audience. We went backstage and conversed. Then she hiked up her dress and let me likk her between the legs. I really liked her blonde pubik hairs! She tasted quite good. Then we returned and continued to discuss right wing politics. And we both agree, right-wing, schmight wing, who cares! Who cares when I gave her the surprise I did."
1,Ann Coulter is a Great Writer!,"Not since possibly Stephen King have I seen a fiction writer of such magnitude. Honestly I think what this country needs are more anorexic conservative hate-mongers.I do not agree with her referring it into two types of people like liberals or conservatives. It should actually be rationalists and blood-thirsty, money-hungry conservatives.Too bad for her that her books have not sold nearly as much as ""liberals"" like Michael Moore. It just must burn her up to know that people would rather read what she calls ""misconstrued facts and lies"" then what she is writing about. The conservatives may have conquered the television media through their control of the FCC and deregulation but they still can't stop us from reading differing opinions in books. I've read her book and what Adolf...Ann is selling most of use people with any sense aren't buying."
1,DOn't buy or sell this book,"The writer and publisher of this book is on a subversive mission to undermine democracy and the rights of those who live in this country and are not a paid member of their treacherous group. Stop advertising, selling and buying anythig to do with them. They are worse than the Mcarthyites they support ."
1,A Complete Farse!,"This book is set of complete lies that Ann Coulten makes just so people would talk about her. She says ""all liberals commit the act of treason"". Yet, when she is asked to name liberals that have commit treason, she fails to give any names of liberals that are still alive. This is a terrible book which most be avoided at all costs. I can't believe this book every got published. Stay Away!"
2,"Obnoxious, if slightly amusing","I find it always quite entertaining while listening to or reading some ultra, on the edge of fanatism, conservative (as in this case) or liberal. It's almost funny but reading this book and trying to follow the logic of the author, her many quotes from various sources, creates a totally opposite effect from the one the author desires. Just in this particular sense the book is a failure - it failes to convey the message. Besides, it's full of hatred and very obnoxious. Al Franken called this book a political pornography and I totally agree. The book contains a few interesting points and arguments but the way Ann Coulter writes about it kills any potential interest in these points and arguments (in the end people don't watch pornography to find some interesting ideas)."
1,"Certainly ""Treason"" of the highest degree","Ms. Coulter's book is yet another example of shameless demagogues pandering to mass hysteria with an assortment of senseless arguments haphazardly slapped together with a choice bit of foul language to make it an appetizing read for the ""common man."" Truly, an insult to all of our intellects.A true patriot and a true American concerned with our Nation's political situation would do better to read the Federalist Papers, actual Constitutional law, or otherwise read about America's place in history and the world. I personally suggest Plato's Republic as a warning about how people like Anne Coulter destroy our culture and democracy by debasing politics to a mudslinging contest, followed by a healthy dose of American history to remedy any pessimism that Plato might leave."
1,The Worst Book I have ever read,"0 out of 5 stars!!!Filled with hate and divisions about Americans.Full of bias. As an avid reader, I try to read all sides, left, right, independent, middle, everything. This was a waste of time, after the 5th chapter, could not stand it. Good to see a lot of other readers feel the same way. Wouldn't even put it in my yard sale!"
1,This is Trash,This is trash.Don't buy it.This author is full of hatred and has foam at her mouth. She is a dangerous fascist.
1,Anti-Ann On This One,"This is a bad book in a good cause. We need a thoughtful reexamination (or, to use Eisenhower/Dulles language, an agonizing reappraisal) of an era the Left has identified with a back-bench junior senator instead of with the traitors he ineptly tried to fight. We need a book that exposes the Left's continuing cover-up of bad deeds by left-wing spies in high places during the New Deal, the Fair Deal, and Joe McCarthy's raw deal. McCarthy set back the just cause of anti-communism; this book sets back the cause of setting the record straight.Two scholars from Yale, Haynes and Klehr, don't have Coulter's talent for trouble or her avidity for headlines. They have a plodding passion for truth, and their books are worthy of your time. Coulter's Treason isn't."
1,Tough Time to be a Conservative,"Thanks to the likes of Hannity, Limbaugh, Coulter, Savage, and the other conservative infotainers, it's hard not to laugh when someone professes to be a ""conservative"". Often, they will disassociate themselves from their ilk shortly after stating their political orientation. (I'm a conservative, but I don't listen to Limbaugh - or, I'm a conservative but I can't stand Hannity; or I think that Couter chick is nuts...) Thanks to these infotainers, to profess to being ""conservative"" grows increasingly synonymous to proclaiming yourself to be an imbecile - really!These high profile bafoons are doing a number on the credibility of the republican party. If there is a left-wing media conspiracy, they're surely a part of it. I am thankful they are on the other side. (Moore? Franken? No comparison both in terms of degree or exposure...)"
1,Don't buy this book people...,"From all the jibes going back and forth, you would think this is a great work of political theory. It isn't. It's a poorly written, factually suspect, hastily compiled work of mere opinions. Liberals will hate it because it is clearly biased, and only the dumbest conservatives will believe all of the things she says in here. If you have to read it, wait until it gets in the bargain bins (and it will). The sad thing is that, since this book has managed to generate so much controversy, this woman is bound to be published again. Like Morton Downey Jr., like Rush Limbaugh, even, I might add, like Joe McCarthy himself, Coulter and her opinions are a fad who will fade in time and no one will even remember what all the fuss is about."
1,Ann should learn to read before she writes,"I bought this book thinking that I would finally read something intelligent on this topic from the conservative perspective. Unfortunately, Ann seems to have decided that it's easier to simply make up a lot of so-called ""facts"" rather than taking the time and energy to actually research what are fairly easily obtainable historical data. Shame on her. She's giving us conservatives a bad name."
1,"Your'e joking right, please tell me your'e joking.","With every passing word I was sickened and horrified at the submoronic statements that Coulter was making. People actually swallowed this drivel? People like Coulter have one agenda in mind and that is to make money. She has discovered like the Newt Gingrichs'(who cheats and lies to his wife while she is dieing of cancer, then preaches family values) that there is a fortune to be made by wrapping themselves in the flag and demonizing a particular group. These books appeal to the ignorant and mean in our society. ""Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundral,"" definitely applies to Coulter and her fellow ilk."
1,One man's treason is another man's patriotism.,"Treason...? You decide.....""Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.... there was no viable ""exit strategy"" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international responseto aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.""George Herbert Walker Bush, from his memoir, A World Transformed (1998)"
1,Sewage,"Ann Coulter's latest book provides yet another example of her shocking ignorance of history, politics, and diplomacy. I have news for you, Coulter: Joe McCarthy pickled what brains he had with alcohol and died a chronic alcoholic in the gutter where he belonged. Richard Nixon avoided prison only because Gerald Ford pardoned him. The list of conservative fools and felons is endless. But in our sick political culture, any unprincipled writer or media pundit who attacks liberals can make a ton of money. Ann Coulter is a disgrace, but the people who read her garbage are even more disgraceful. Well, America has survived idiots before, and America will survive this latest right wing epidemic of idiots."
1,what better way to promote liberal thinking,"As one of the previous true conservative reviewers commented, with this book and others she has written, she has actually made the liberal way of thinking look much better and nicer. Many have turned away from the Republican party because of her, and other extremists, vileness and hateful way of looking at the world. Read this book and then read LIVING HISTORY by Hillary Clinton and compare their personalities. Hillary comes off sounding like a true,fair and compassionate lady and Ann comes off sounding like an uncontrolable shrew. I am serious. Ann labels anyone who disagrees with her way of thinking as treasonous and yet I know many people who don't agree with me and I think the world of them. Liberals love our country just as much as the conservatives. I believe you need a balance to keep the country healthy and happy."
1,"Vicious, extreme... and embarrasing",".Conservatism is far worse off than I thought it was, if conservatives are looking to someone like Ann Coulter to be a leader in championing their positions.One of the *MAJOR* sources for Ann Coulter's `footnotes', Ron Radosh, is considered one of most reputable scholars who has studied the McCarthy era.This is what Ron Radosh had to say about Ann Coulter's book Treason:""I am furious and upset about her book. I am reading it -she uses my stuff, Harvey Klehr and John Haynes, AllenWeinstein etc. to distort what we actually say and tomake ludicrous and historically incorrect arguments....""One would think that an author would be embarrassed and humiliated if one of their main sources totally disputes their writings.Wouldn't you?."
1,A great classroom teaching tool!,"I find this book most useful in teaching critical thinking skills in the classroom. It takes even the slowest students no time at all to pick out numerous fallacies in logic. Ad populum, ad hominem, name calling, slippery slopes, glittering generalities, sweeping generalizations...all within a mere one or two pages! Thanks, Ann! Your writing makes teaching faulty reasoning a breeze!"
3,If hate is a motivation to read this book . . .,". . why waste my time? I can only assume from reading the reviews that this is more of the same swill from a ""camp"" that believes their side is blessed with ""no wrongs"" while their opponents are cursed by being ""all wrong, all of the time."" I give Ann three stars for her hair - that's at least as relevant as most of what you'll read about this book."
1,overblown simplistic trash,"All I needed to do was to read the excerpt on the Amazon site to know what the rest was like - jumbled, selective excerpts from the Bush-Dukakis race(?!?), and quotes from a few far out of the mainstream ""liberal"" professors and politicians to build a case that all liberals are evil, unpatriotic whiners and all conservatives are god-fearing, patriotic, and (of course) always right. Does this add anything useful to a discussion of real differences between the majority of voters in the country, made up of moderates from both sides of the political spectrum and not political characatures? What crap."
1,Chilling,"In ""Slander"" Ann Coulter simply used her perspective to accuse the media of liberal bias. However, with her latest book she paints all liberals with a broad brush, and says that they are guilty of one of the highest crimes we have.She holds McCarthy up as a hero and a victim of treasonous liberals. She claims there is this massive liberal conspiracy, which leads me to wonder why our government is firmly controlled by conservative interests, and she resorts to base name-calling of former President Clinton.Her book seems one shade away from suggesting that all of ""THOSE"" kind of people be rounded up and placed in camps ""for their own protection and the protection of the country"".A good read in the sense of seeing just how radical the radical right is becoming, right up there with ""Mein Kampf""."
1,Wonderful...,piece of kindling this will make come winter. More hysterical ranting aimed to reinforce the patterned beliefs of dittoheads. Lacks a large enough number of spurious footnotes...
1,Insulting to conservatives and liberals alike.,"This poorly researched hate proaganda is a direct insult to liberals - as it is intended to be, but is an unintended insult to conservatives by making us look like whiny idiots. Come on. We know who hates America and it isn't other Americans. Utter trash. This is nothing but one woman's opinion. There is nothing new in here - just history spun from a hysterical right wing pont of view. If that's all your looking for, then go ahead, close your mind and read. Here's your book."
1,What a piece of garbage....,"...lady writes sloppy stuff....If only I could meet the people who bought this book so I could listen to their ""facts"". Oh brother, that would make my year hahahahaha...."
5,Very important book,I read the book in 3 days. Incredible. If you read the reviews that gave the book one star you will see that obviously none of them read it. The left is very scared of this book as they should be. It's a shame that none of them will read it.
1,Intellectual? Give me a break.,"I used to wonder how someone who spouts such bigoted trash as does Ann Coulter could ever be considered an ""intellectual."" It has since become clear to me that it does indeed take a very devious and deviant kind of intellectual to dumb down, with such unerring consistency, all this vile and bigoted, clichéd trash to where it can be swallowed hook line and sinker, without eliciting so much as a gag reflex, by so many millions of the uneducated. Incapable of formulating their own opinions, they learn by rote these clichés, and then *think* they have an opinion.Millions of gullible and simple minds in lockstep, gobbling up fast-food for the mind, dancing to the strings of masters playing them like millions of marionettes. Does not bode well for the future of democracy in this country."
5,"Liberal response to Coulter's book, ""Treason""","The one-star, liberal reviews of ""Treason"" are amusing in that the authors of the reviews apparently failed to look at all of the notes at the end of the book. The references clearly provided there clarify and support Coulter's conclusions. The apparent failure to read the references is typical of the leftists who have been brain-washed for years by the liberal media and who do everything possible to avoid the facts."
1,Half-truths and poor research passed off as fact,"Wow. This book is even worse than Slander. Coulter shows once again why she is an embarressment to ""history"". Attempting to cast fanatics like MacCarthy as sympathetic misunderstood ""patriots"", Coulter twists the few historical facts she includes and omits the rest. People who dearly want Coulter's version of the past to be true are willing to ignore factual evidence, and that is exactly what Coulter counts upon."
2,What's next Ann?..,"What's next Ann?.. Bashing ""liberal media"" with a dirty toungue, and accusing them of covering up the crimes of Lenin, Stalin, H Chi Minh, Pol Pot, Nelson Mandela, Ortega, Kim Jung Il, Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro for years ."
5,The most informative book written in 2003,"I was simply impressed by this book. Easy to read, and yet could be a doctoral dissertation withh all the facts and sources Ann uses. Only the most ignorant of individuals (aka extreme Democrat voters) could continue to see McCarthy as the bad guy and Alger Hiss the good guy after reading this book.After reading this book, I now know why the Left so hates Ann. She's a sarcastic conservative, like Rush, so she can always make fun of the Left. Plus, she's sexy, therefore, the left can't do what they like to do with women they dislike (Linda Tripp for example), and disparage her looks."
1,I smell a whiff of facism in the air...,"If this book shows us anything - its that the true agenda of the right wing in this country has become so extremist that the next logical step for their political agenda is facism. Let me remind everyone that this is a DEMOCRACY - or suppose to be, anyways. Democracy means being able to think critically, speak without fear of being labelled un-patriotic or treasonous, and maintain individual rights. If it were up to Ann Coulter and those who agree with her, we should lose these values of democracy tomorrow. If it were up to them, political opposition parties would be banned in America, and we would on our way towards a totalitarian state.This is NOT a debate about liberal vs. conservative, but instead, democracy vs. totalitarian rule. These are truly dangerous times in America, when you consider the kind of influence these extremists have right now in our media and government. Wake up, America, before its too late."
1,"Give me a break, willya...","Ann really has to work hard to rehabilitate Joe McCarthy. It's just too bad that all those horrible liberals like Dwight Eisenhower and the Republican-controlled Senate finally put an end to the nonsense of this ""American hero"" and ""protector of freedom."" Come to think of it, though, Ann and Joe make a real fun couple: two blowhards, each loose with the facts, who have no hesitation about saying anything about anyone they disagree with."
5,Isn't it simply amazing...,"...That none of the liberals that attacked this book in their reviews bothered to take on issues or facts? No, they simply resort to name-calling and outright dismissal of the work simply because it questions their views.Fortunately, that is what this book is about. The plain, unvarnished truth is that the liberal agenda has become plainly anti-American. Coulter's book exposes some of the Left's Great Big Lies, and since they cannot and will not deal with facts, it's easier for them to resort to canned hatred and smear tactics. Read the online reviews, see for yourself. Better yet, skip the reviews and buy the book."
3,These reader reviews are hopeless,"Folks, is there one among you capable of reviewing a politically charged book for its literary merits? It is, after all, like...you know...a BOOK. It's not a speech on Fox News, it's not a handout at a rally. It's . . . a . . . B-O-O-K. And as books go, this one is passing. Literate, witty, argumentative, but by no means vitriolic to the point of alienating intelligent readers who might disagree with her points (please note ""intelligent""). If you can't review a book for its form as WELL as its content, what are you even doing here?"
1,Spend your $$$ on Harry Potter if you want quality fantasy,"Ann would like to topple Hillary Clinton's perch, but this ""work"" is so implausible, inaccurate, self-indulgent, and long-winded that it had me aching for G. Gordon Liddy's old commentaries for something conservative, yet digestible. The rhetoric spewed in this simply-written diatribe reminds one more of Goebbels than of a sound political analyst. At least O'Reilly appears to speak from a platform of educated scrutiny, not a shrill cry for attention by spinning tall tales. I managed to get through this book in one reading, but not without a lot of head-shaking and several smirks. Coulter's from CORNELL? The college, right?Thanks for the laughs, Ann....but readers are best advised to save their money for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" if they want quality fantasy. Yes, you're cuter to look at than Limbaugh, but I'll settle for Gingrich's observations for their substance. Heck -- Hillary Clinton's too, for that matter."
1,"Similar to Stupid White Men, by Michael Moore","Slamming of those with different view points, half truths, lopsided viewpoints, and downright irrationality. Coulter, The right's answer to Michael Moore, proves that smuggness and loathing are all it takes to sell a book in these divided times.Not a book for those easily nauseated. Pure tripe."
1,There Are Lots of Smart Conservatives -- She Isn't One,"There are any number of intelligent conservative voices. Ann Coulter isn't one of them. I'm a moderate Democrat, pro-military, in favor (with reservations) of this war. I'm open to Republican arguments on a broad range of topics. I suffer from that endemic weakness of moderates: an open mind.But Ms. Coulter offers nothing of interest to anyone with an open mind -- or any other variety of mind. She's a liar and a tiresome one at that. She is a living, breathing reproach ... not to Democrats or Liberals, but to Republicans. Republicans can't possibly be stupid enough to buy this desperate wanna-be pundit's drivel. Can they? My many Republican friends share nothing in common with this sad, silly woman."
1,"Sad that ""political discourse"" has come to this.","Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it."" Sadly, the success of books such as this one, as well as the success of Ms. Coulter's career as a pundit/raving lunatic in general, casts doubt as to whether reason alone is up to the challenge."
1,The usual hateful rhetoric,"This is nothing than the wet dream of the right, the essence of all their hateful, vile fantasies put to print, with no relation to reality whatsoever. Interesting reading just to see the abyss of where the ""conservatives"" (I put this in quotes because these so-called conservatives conserve nothing) want to lead the country."
1,Fascism,This book clearly illustrates the greatest danger to American freedom: simple-minded hate-mongering from the extreme right.
5,Good musical obtain from Amazon,I would say this is one of the best cd from Al Caiola which I purchased for more than 40 years.Good to obtain some good oldies from Amazon in US & Japen.Books from Amazon UK.
1,This whole series is very weak.,"If you want a good yoga workout, don't buy any of the tapes in this series. The ""workout"" is more like goofy floor exercises that have nothing to do with yoga. I bought the whole series without knowing about them and they're gathering dust now. Very disappointing."
4,Excellent as always,"Nick Saloman is a one-man psychedlic revival - a truly gifted songwriter and brilliant instrumentalist. North Circular sometimes falls short of genius, but for the most part it offers up the usual super guitarwork and smart lyrics. High points include ""Revival"" and ""The Wind Blew All Around Me."""
2,Not so great!,"I bought this for my 4.5 year old daughter for Christmas. I thought this would be a great easily portable fun disc player for her. Already I am very disappointed. Several times when my daughter has gone to watch a disc the screen stays black and you can hear it but see nothing. It is so frustrating for her and myself. Also, within a few days a big orange blotch appeared in the middle of the screen and will not go away. My daughter says it doesn't bother her and she still enjoys it when it is functioning properly. However, I am very disappointed with it and wish that I would have never purchased the item. I would advise that you not waste your money and just spend the money on a portable DVD player instead."
1,Please!!!!!!!,"please dont get this if dont listen any other review listen to mine please dont get this ,this is so lame i have it, it dont work its real fat and stupied looking hey kids please your wasting you time and money DONT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
3,This is an older book,"The reason this feels less in-depth than Pilcher's major novels is that this is actually an early novel that was re-released after she became a bestseller. Not to worry -- she is currently working on a new one, due out by Fall 2004. Meanwhile, try Winter Solstice and September, both of which I liked even better than The Shell Seekers......"
3,A quick read... but not much substance,"I love Rosamunde Pilcher's writing style and have greatly enjoyed her books over the years. This particular book is a nice little read, but lacks the story line substance of some of her other books."
5,"""Wings"" Soars Again!","The restored version of ""Wings"" Is what 1927 audiences must have experienced when the film was first released. The tints, the orchestral score, and the sound effects (which I found at first odd) enhance the experience. The photography looks much more spectacular than on any other print of ""Wings"" I have ever seen. (More silent movies should be restored as incredibly as ""Wings"" has been.) The restoration makes the film more accessible for modern audiences without losing any of the charm or sense of time from when it was made. The ""Making Of"" special feature is a plus, too. A must for everybody who loves classic films!"
1,Stay away from TrimSpa!,"This product is a waste of your money. I took the pills as directed for a month and saw no weight loss whatsoever. Actually, I gained weight while I was taking TrimSpa!"
1,wirst experiance I had with an online purchase,"It has been over a month and I have not received the item yet when I was given an estimated date of arrival as December 26, 2010"
4,dvd movie,I really like the actor/actress that plays the Hamptons. It keeps you very interested when watching it. I like the ending where the boyfriend got his due.
2,A hateful woman,This woman was probably a very unhappy person with money or with out money. The proved that money cannot make you happy. In fact it might make you a killer.
3,strange,I bought this CD on recomendation of jackiesdog and found itstrange - not like any other Juan Gabriel recordings that I ormy friends own. I like best his live music.
3,Madison,"Growing up in Detroit during the 50's and 60's with unlimited hydroplane racing in my blood, I found the movie Madison to be a relatively accurate portrail of the ""golden age"" of this dying sport. No longer can you actually see the drivers struggling to control these monsterous racing machines and the sound their turbine motors make now doesn't live up to their reputation as ""thunder boats"". It was great to see the beautiful restorations of these wonderful craft running in anger during the movie. That being said however, the plotline of Madison doesn't seem to me would be very interesting to anyone unfamiliar with the sport of unlimited hydroplane racing, which may explain why the movie didn't do very well at the box office."
4,Practical textbook,"Public Relations for School Leaders is a useful combination of theory and practice. The authors dicuss public relations in the broader sense of building a sense of community both within and without the school itself. They use the case study technique to present practical applications, and the case studies are quite well done. The authors do not always distinquish clearly between a case study and a secton called administrative practice, but that presents no real problem to the student or the teacher.The final two chapters on building a community relations plan are overly technical and too complicated. However, overall, this is a well written text which will be of use in a graduate program for school administrators."
5,Hilarious adventure about kids raising money for their schoo,"Bruno and Boots, best friends, learn that their school is going to be closed down due to financial problems. They try to break world records to earn fame and more students coming to their school. From apple-peeling records to can pyramid records, this book contains adventures that you've got to read."
3,Rodney Carrington - Greatest Hits,Rodney has a very good singing voice. Although he is very funny this is not a cd you would let your kids listen to. Nor is it a cd you would give to your church friends.
3,AMAZINGLY Technical!,"This book is full of formulas for computing maximum theorhetical speed through corners, and the like. The information is presented in a way that people with several seasons under their belts could use, but definitely NOT for the beginner, unless you happen to also hold a PHD in physics. If you are considering writing a video game, THIS is the book for you. It has all the formulas you'll need to make your car handle realistically."
3,Not exactly what it says it is,"I enjoyed the first sequence of flow yoga. Good instructions and variations are shown but not really talked about. It was the restorative yoga portion I had problems with. They should have called it what it is; a pilates workout. Anyone who has done a restorative program knows you aren't doing crunches. So, overall, a nice workout with good instructors, just bad with the descriptions."
5,Great product,"easy to attach. very stable. For cleaning gutters, this is great. Would recommend this product to anyone, even contractors.Thank you"
4,"works good, but beware of roof","This stabilizer works good, it allows you to work on dormers and get closer to them than if the ladder was against the gutters, and it saves the gutters. But beware, the hard plastic caps will dig into your asphalt shingles and also damage them if you drag it across. I first put down small rubber backed area rugs from the Depot, either using the window in the dormer or another ladder. Also, it makes the ladder top heavy, so with one person I usually lean the ladder against the gutters temporarily, then add the stabilizer out the dormer window or with another ladder."
4,Steady Stabilizer,"Made working on my roof alot safer, kept the ladder away from my gutters. It did add weight to my 24' extension ladder witch made it a little bit harder to handle and to get it into the proper position. It made me feel more secure while I made my egress from the roof."
2,written for the 12-year old.,"I was pretty excited to finally get this book. But most of my expectations were far too high. This book (pamphlet would be a better title) contains only 42 pages of actual text, about 30 pages of quotes... one quote per page and very little information. If you are looking for an extremely oversimplified book on investing, this is the one. It would be a good gift for your 12-year old, but the 12-year old will be hungry for more information after taking the 30 minutes to read the book."
5,Did Exactly What I Expected It To Do,"I am 22 years old and was interested in investing for my retirement. I had no idea where or how to get started. I needed the absolute basics. The book was simple and to the point. No confusing terms or information that was way over my head. The book contains motivational quotes, which I liked because I have been putting this off for a couple of years so they helped me get going. I would recommend the book to anyone 25 or younger that is not familiar investing, but would like to get started."
4,Read with an open mind.,"If you have a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book. If you don't you will hate it. It is totally tounge in cheek and meant to be that way. Don't take it seriously, you're not supposed to. Personally I found the book hilarious, course I am naturally crazy. To judge whether or not you will like it; if you like the humorous episodes of Xena, then you will enjoy it. It has the same humor and one liners as they use on the show. Thanks for listening and Battle On my friends!"
3,Funny,"A fun book, with some good laughs. Some of the whimsical remarks are expected. The price for the book is a little too high for what it contains."
3,3 and a half,"Okay i'll have to admit that this album is a little better than his last effort ""Show Me Your Tears."" But it's still not up to standard of what i think hes capable of. (see my review for ""SMYT"")"
2,Not worth it.,"My kids wanted this for Christmas so I got them one. It played good, but buying the movies that you could only watch in this machine was a money waster. You can get a dvd player that you can watch any movie on and you would be better off."
1,Stupid,This movie is rediculous. The interpertaion of Bob's second wife is totally a lie. There is nothing like lying to the movie audience.
3,"Sadly, it's a sex/morality flick","Given Schrader's track record, there was a 50-50 chance that this would be good. I find his sex/morality flicks (Hardcore, America Gigolo) cold, leaden and disengaging, while his two bio pics - Patty Heart and Mishima - are his best. Sadly, this one is a sex/morality flick. Willem Dafoe and Rita Wilson do give great performances, however. And Greg Kinnear is Bob Crane -- which means, like Crane, all he had to do was show up."
5,The best 30 for 30 so far,I have watched every 30 for 30 so far and this is by far the best. What a great story. I was totally engrossed in the story the whole time. I was still thinking about it for days afterwards. Highly recommend.
5,The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin,"One can never go wrong with Gordon S. Wood, of course! This book is excellent. Wood is a great Historian and a remarkable story-teller. Read this even if you are not a Ben Franklin fan... afterwards you will be."
2,Slightly better than worthless,"I saw that this auto organizer was well reviewed and decided to pick it up. I just bought a new car and wanted to avoid the sprawl that had taken over the glove box of my last one. In particular I wanted something I could stuff a couple of pens into so that I'm not hunting around for them at inopportune times.The organizer showed up and I was immediately disappointed. It certainly is not worth the $12 asking price. It is basically a very thin/cheap vinyl surround with a few pockets and an extremely flimsy feel.In fact, it is almost impossible to zip it or unzip it with one hand (if it's lying on the passenger seat, etc) as it is so flimsy that the entire zipper flops around. I actually have a smaller organizer from Expedia that is much better (and it was a freebie) but it's a little to small to hold the things I need. If it was I would 86 this thing in a minute."
2,A Liberal perspective on child care,"A primer on public policy on child care, contains proposals for a 'brave new world'-style child care system, where Government and community-directed collective child care starts from birth onwards. Zigler wants daycare to extend as long as the workdays of mothers and fathers, implement before- and after-school care, etc.The problem is, their own data shows the obvious solution: The best ""day care"" is parental care. Searching for better out-of-home care is pointless when in-home care - by mothers - is the real and best solution for children. Their data is good, but the attempt to square the real needs of children with the hollow feminist ideology that in-home mothering isn't important is ultimately self-refuting."
5,Fantastic voice and performance,"I just become interested on Sarah when listening to ""Love song"". I bought the CD abd the this DVD came. Excellent performance and voice. She has a lot of talent. This DVD is very good since it shows a closer look to sarah personal side"
5,Good value and quality for the price,"I've seen this in stores for almost double the price, so this is a great value. I use these bars to replace a meal a day to help me meet my weight loss goals. At 20G of protein with no sugar, they're perfect. The taste is pretty good - while the flavor is listed as ""chunky"" peanut butter, it's not really that chunky or crunchy. However, I've never had the ""creamy"" one to compare."
3,Just OK,I guess these bars are what they claim they are. But the taste and consistency leaves something to be desired. Did keep me from being hungry. I would buy again if they were on some super sale but not worth the regular price at least for me.
2,Not what I expected,"I was specifically looking for a gluten-free, high protein bar that didn't taste like dessert or have chocolate in it that could melt. These seemed simple and are advertised as chunky peanut butter. Nowhere in the description, title or picture on the package did it mention chocolate. I now have a box of protein bars that I cant' take hiking with me, because they melt.I'd rather find a simple gluten-free, high-protein bar that I could eat in the morning without the chocolate. Seems impossible to find. I was very disappointed."
1,YUK!,"These bars were the worse protein bars I've ever eaten. Not only did they taste like the box, they were old. The chocolate was ashey and stale.I had to throw them away."
1,Not that good..,"Clearly were old/stale and had a weird chemical aftertaste. Filling if you're traveling and don't want to eat junk food but really need to be ""washed down""."
2,Got Progressively Worse...,"I love Think Thin Bars. Love them. I eat one every morning. This crunchy peanut butter is my favorite. ""Subscribe and save"" seems like a bargain, but by the time I was six months into the program, the bars I was receiving were bloomed, chalky, and gave every appearance of having been stored in a hot place, which certainly compromised the quality and eating experience (and maybe even the nutritional value, like the vitamins). I cancelled my subscription, and am back to buying them at a higher price at my local grocery store."
3,Freshness questionable,"Bars appear to have been either mishandled in storage/transport, or they are just old. Bars on surface should be uniform chocolate color but instead are dry and ashy. This is a disappointment, considering I ordered a whole case. Taste is also dry."
3,Good source of protein,I found that the flavor is not great but its a good source of protein and affordably priced so 3 stars when you consider everything.
2,Not fresh...,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers -- the bars were not as ""fresh"" as when purchased in a store, specifically, Trader Joe's. The chocolate had a ""chalky"" coating. I feel like they may have been stored improperly. The chocolate on the bars purchased at Trader Joe's was creamy and just looked ""fresher."" I'd rather pay more for the ones at Trader Joe's as they appear to be fresher. Having said that, however, the bars themselves are actually very good and I will purchase them again, just not through Amazon."
3,Lots of Protein....Very Little Taste,"Peanut butter is at the top of my likes, but this protein bar was very hard to swallow. It was dry and not a whole lot of taste. It does have 20 grame of protein and that is a lot for one bar. It is also super low in sugar."
1,Penance,"I have had trouble with this movie, it goes blank after about a quarter of the way through it. I have tried it many times, and it does it every time. I think I got a bad movie."
1,Not a good book to use for education,"I am an envoronmental engineering student, and my instructor for a course used this book. I thought it was cumbersome to use, I came from a civil engineering department, as much of it was referencing chemical engineering material without sufficient review and background. I also thought that it made so much reference to PDES, weber's other text, that it should just be included as part of that book. I wouldnt recommend this to another sudent."
4,Great solution for sloppy ties,"I bought this for my husband since he's never happy with the tie storage issue. He loves it! It holds all of his ties with some room for more. The light and motorized action is kind of fun. The mounting on the closet bar is a snap, you just open the gripper and turn a knob to tighten it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the grip on the closet bar is not vice-grip tight; there is some ""give"" as it's used. The little ""arms"" holding each tie have a curve on the end, so it's almost impossible for ties to slip off. The arms are well spaced, so ties are easy to take off the rack and replace after use.Overall, we're happy with this solution for tie storage since it takes up very little space in the closet and is easy to use."
2,Weak and doesn't fit,The other reviews are accurate. This tie rack does not fit several very common closet rods. Also it is very cheaply made and in no way can support more than about 30 ties. There are very thin plastic supports that break easily yet they are responsible for supporting the entire rack..........just not very well thought out.
3,One Way,"This is only part of One Way Hits! Should be a two cd set! You Better Quit is a great song, I never heard it before!"
1,Couldn't make it through,"Where's the plot? I picked this up through recommendations from others, so I know it's well-liked by someone, but when I tried reading it all I could find was a stream of constant annoying introspection, catch-phrases... and no plot. No interesting characters, either. Figuring that by the middle of the book something should have happened, I put it down in favor of a Patricia C. Wrede fantasy -- such fun! Perhaps a plot appeared in the second half of Jinxed and I missed it, too bad. I also hear strong recommendations about the prequel to this, so perhaps that's a good book and making a sequel was just (imho) a mistake. For something along the same lines but a little better in quality and possessing somewhat of a plot, a reader might try the T*Witches series."
5,Chilton's still the best!,As usual I was not disappointed with this manual. It's very comprehensive covering everything from rotating the tires to rebuilding the engine! I've always bought Chilton manuals for my vehicles and I do about 99% of the work on them.
5,Incredible details and exhaustive research on the YVRR,"This is the most comprehensive collection of photos and data on the Yosemite Valley Railroad yet published. The book is not merely a rehash of photos that you have seen over and over, but many entirely new photos...a lifetimes collection. Jack's excellent eye for details and dedication in reaching out to those who worked on the RR, lived in the community, or researched this road, make this book a real treasure."
3,great For the price,ThIs is the second one we have purchased because my son played with his first jet pack until it broke. It's cheaply made but worth the $10-$15 of enjoyment it brings.
3,"For a Cheap Toy, It's Good","This was not a very expensive toy. The low cost is reason enough to buy it of you've got a Buzz fan in your home. They are inflatable, so it's only as durable as your child is gentle. It's decent sized and seems to hold its shape well. The straps that attach to the arms are a little cheap and could be easily broken, though. For the cost, it's a fun toy."
4,Buzz jet pack,"I bought this to go with my four year old son's halloween costume this year. It worked well, and made the outfit! The only thing I wasn't happy with was one of the straps broke while we were out trick or treating. The thread broke. It was easily fixed though and didnt slow us down a bit! Over all I would recommend this product for short uses."
4,Great,My son loves these wings. We got them for Halloween and they are just fun for him to play with now that Halloween is over.
3,Worked...twice,"I purchased this kit for my son for halloween. We had three trick or treat times to go to. The first one was at my work, the wings worked great. The second was trick or treat around the neighborhood the same night. Worked fine again. The third was the next day at my mom's work, I went to inflate the wings for only the third time...there was a little hole on one of the seams and they would not inflate. I know that it's a kids toy and it's not supposed to last forever, but three time of inflating? I expected more."
2,Wings work better when they stay on,"The wings come with a warning that they could be a choking hazard. *Fortunately* this risk is 99.9% removed by the straps that simply do not stay velcroed. Our son is only three (and a skinny three I may add) and already we have had to put the straps on the largest setting. If we can manage to get them on him without the velcro undoing, the first time he tries to fly ""to infinity and beyond"" at least one strap snaps. I am going to try to sew them shut, because he LOVES LOVES LOVEs having Buzz Lightyear wings, but I certainly wouldn't buy them again."
3,Bought for a Two Year Old,"Let's start with the good:- My boy loved the wings- They weren't costly- They made the costume- Gave him some aerodynamics lessons (in a fun manner). Not that he'll remember but I like to think I laid a nice foundation.Continue with the bad:- Cheaply made- Defective out of the box. The air gasket wouldn't close, some scotch tape fixed it.- Large wingspan (not the manufacturers fault but be aware that things will get knocked around).Overall, I'm glad we bought them for his costume, they looked great in pictures and my boy ran around the house and on Halloween yelling ""I'm Buzz Lightyear""."
1,beebo brinker,I am happy with my purchase but my review is more to do with publication. There are 50 pages reprinted and out of order in the book and 50 pages missing. I am frustrated because this is almost the end of the book.
1,Possibly the worst vampire movie in the world?,"Hmm, what can I say about this movie apart from that it's best to avoid it like the plague? Unfortunately this is just one in a long line of vampire movies I have watched and been utterly disappointed by. It seems that many movies of this genre start out with a good premise but fail to deliver the goods and this movie is an outstanding example. The script and acting are incredibly poor and at times so ridiculous you have to laugh. It's obvious they didn't have a big budget for this movie, but honestly, is there any point in making a vampire movie if you're going to shoot the whole thing during the day because you can't afford to shoot it at night?"
2,Blood and Bullets,This is a low budget vampire action movie. The cover seems to suggest a Blade [concept] but there is more time spent shooting guns than neck biting. A scientist working on an experimental AID's cure is infected by a virus which turns him into a vampire.
4,Wonderful Movie,"I bought Orphans of the Storm on DVD after having seen it on Turner Classic Movies. I just fell in love with it after seeing it for the first time.However, the DVD version is much different than the one shown on TCM. The music is completely different. I thought the score on TCM was wonderful, very choreographed to the scenes, and very moving. But the score on the DVD just sounds like generic music played on a modern keyboard.Also, the film on DVD has been slowed down to the ""visually correct speed."" This is both a blessing and a curse. It was interesting to see how the scenes played out in ""real time,"" but I thought the film paced itself much better in the speeded-up version on TCM. With it slowed down, it did seem to drag a bit.Overall this is a good DVD, even though personally I think the version on TCM is the better one to watch."
4,"Definitive, thorough yet easy to follow history of atomic energy for kids","As all Landmark books, this is a book written by an expert in the field at the time of publication. Printed in 1961 assures the reader there is no revisionist history, but it also provides some outdated information as the technology is from 1961 or earlier. Given that disclaimer, this is a volume that was very interesting to my boys as we learned about the scientific research that went into atomic energy. While the research reached a height in WWII and the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, the author then turns the corner to offer peaceful applications for this energy source.Given the time the book was written, 1961 wasn't that far from the close of WWII, it's sensitive to the WWII issues for the US and Japan. However the author does not goes into detail due to the age of the reader.It's a great book for budding scientists, just edit some of the outdated technology and scientific thoughts!"
4,Fun doll!,"I just gave this toy to my daughter who turned six. She is thrilled with it! She loves that she can spray water on the hair with the little comb\spray bottle that it came with. The curlers that came with the doll are hard for her to use, so she hasn't really tried to make the ""crazy curls"" that the doll is supposed to be used for. She is not patient enough to wet the hair, roll it in curlers, and then let it dry for several hours. It only comes with a few curlers and that is not enough to do her entire head all at once. But, having said that, she has had a lot of fun and I am pleased!"
5,sweet little book for fortune telling,This book is nice and compact. It has all kinds of ideas on how to tell your fortune. I got this book to help my son develope his skills and for me to try other forms of divination. I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in learning more about fortune telling.
5,Refreshingly intelligent satire,"Aaron Eckhart is fast becoming one of my favorite actors to watch (The Dark Night and Conversations with Other Women both showcase his talent) but my interest started with his excellent portrayal of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry in this great movie.It's hard to find fault in Thank You For Smoking. It features an intelligent script, sharp and disciplined acting, and smooth yet brisk pacing. There are plenty of laughs, a perfect dose of heart, and a filleting of not only the lobby world, but of government, Hollywood, power, and the gullible American public that is surgically precise. There are no punches pulled here, Eckhart leads a brilliant cast of actors and Thank You For Smoking is easily one of the best satire comedies I have seen in a long time. When you look at how much praise Tropic Thunder got for trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the same skewering satire, it should make you appreciate a gem like TYFS that much more. This is highly recommended."
5,Hilarious!,"One of the best comedies I've seen in a long, long time. Definitely one to own.... and I do!"
3,A solid rental....,"A somewhat forgettable film, perhaps overrated by critics. It earns points for touching moments between Eckhart and the actor who plays his son, and the overall message it reaches at its conclusion. The satire is not as sharp as everyone will have you believe."
5,"Snarky, Funny, Brilliant!",A movie to make you laugh while you think - an excellent movie that you'll want to watch more than once!
5,shaw/butterfield and jenneys stardust,"the recording of stardust by shaw (with billy butterfieldon trumpet and jack jenny (trombone) that was recorded circa1939 is the recording I want. There were other recordings thatreached the market and thus I am not sure which is on the cd you list.however,I rate that recording as one of the finest pieces of1)music theme;2)arrangement,3)lyrics(by mitch paris) andartistic expression by shaw/butterfield and jennings whosetrombone leap was and is an example of great musianship."
5,The Best,Astral Weeks and Big Pink by the Band are ties as the best popular music albums of all time. Period.
3,Astral Weaks,"I know I am ""supposed"" to like this record. Heck, I am ""supposed"" to think that this record is one of the best in musical history. Well, sorry, but...the guy's voice drives me crazy. He's about as pleasant to listen to as a cat with its foot caught in a fence.The instumental parts are pretty nice, and on occasion, they're great. But Van's voice just completely ruins the thing for me. Blows the mood completely. I can almost picture the veins popping out of his neck as he tries to hit some of these notes.Sorry, but I just can't love this, though I know all of the critics say I should."
2,Vanity Morrison,"You love 'Moondance' and you think 'It's Too Late To Stop Now' is terrific. But you've heard 'Astral Weeks' is the big one, the very zenith of Van-ness. Everyone's told you it's great, the critics routinely rave. Here's the news: they're lying. 'Astral Weeks' is one of those Emperor's New Clothes affairs, like the complete works of The Doors and most Stanley Kubrick films. It's deeply, deeply boring, but because we're meant to - like, you know - dig it, man, we all claim it's one of the most profound spiritual experiences of our lives. It's not. It's mind-numbing hippy tedium from a stolid Ulsterman who really ought to know better, given his background."
3,One of the best?,"I don't think so. This is definitely a DECENT album but some of the songs really do test your patience. ""Madame George"" goes on for an eternity without ever really building to any sort of climax, while Morrison's voice (which I usually enjoy) seems to grate over a few tracks (especially Beside You) that would have been perfectly all right otherwise. The quality of the CD remastering is possibly worse than those of the beatles recordings, which doesn't help. This is in no ways a BAD album, as tracks like the magical, ""Sweet Thing"", ""Astral Weeks"" and ""Cyprus Avenue"" are possibly the best Morrison has ever done; it just eludes me that this is considered one of the best albums ever made when it is definitely not."
5,Indescribable,"I won't even begin to explain to somebody how important this album is. It is top three in my personal collection, if not number one. For a good understanding of what this album means to somebody that I concur with, but I cannot match on a literary level, I recommend reading Lester Bangs' opinion as written in Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung. This is what turned me onto this album and has kept it on my turntable for the last year. Van at his all time best at the ripe age of 19/20."
5,Nice CD indeed,"I guess this would be classified as new age music.The CD is entertaining and yet relaxing; I enjoy listening to it while driving because I find it neither tiring nor boring, even when cycling it through two or three times.Strangely, I did not get particularly excited when i first listened to it. I simply found it a 'nice' album. I give it five stars because I realize now that time did not consume my enjoyment of it: I have owned this album for over two years and I still listen to it regularly. It has not only become one of my classics, but it's also one of my favorite albums."
2,Bit dated and too much focus on US,"There is a wealth of information in this book but one major criticism is that much of the information relates specifically to the United States. Many of the varieties and rootstocks listed are not used outside of North America, or are of only minor importance elsewhere. The pest and diseases section is far too brief.This 1993 edition is also a little dated (many new varieties and rootstocks are not covered). For someone thinking of buying the much more expensive later editions, but not sure whether to take the plunge, this might be good purchase to test out the material.At only $10 or so, its still a useful investment."
3,a fine start for a curious wannabe bjork fan,"I guess since I've been a Bjork fan for a while now, I was hoping to find some new insight into her songs through this book. If you want to learn the intentions and meanings behind Bjork songs, you're better off going to her website or searching online for interpretations or interviews. This book, while providing some solid background information about Bjork, does not provide too much information about the songs themselves. It seems that the author took random quotes and tried to apply them to the songs as he saw fit. The timeline is useful, and pictures are gorgeous. The descriptions for each song are not more than a couple of paragraphs each, far too short to even get an introduction for a Bjork song. It is a good collector's item--that's why I bought it. But if you're looking for some answers, like, what do those bjorkish words mean?, look somewhere else...like the 4um"
3,"Food for thought, but you must be hungry.","Despite being about one of my most favourite subjects, Lanchester's latest work was much work indeed. I tend to consume books in bits and pieces, often leaving the story on a table for days on end before returning. Not easy with A Debt to Pleasure, as it requires constant attention. Nonetheless, John produced some good (if not wordy) writing and insight into something we all like and need - food."
2,"Impressive writing, but twice as long as it should have been.","The paperback I read has 232 pages. The other reviewers cover the good and bad pointsabout this novel. I would only add that I felt it would have been better if it had been halfas long. You finally realize ""what is going on"" at about page 200.Impressive writing, though. I look forward to reading his other books."
2,I took it back for a refund!,"I got this video for my kids, but took it back. I expect a Bible video to be accurate & this one was not. It had Eve being created after the Sabbath instead of on Friday. This is a gross error & there really isn't any excuse for it. If you want your kids to learn the truth, don't let them watch this one!"
5,AMAZING!,"I am not one to write reviews, however this book is so woderfuly written and so powerful in it's tenderness I feel EVERY parent should have and read this book and please share it with other parents of babys ages newborn-4years, or someone planning to become pregnant. I see an example of child abuse,and or nelect everyday and wonder why do these people not care enough to respect the soul they created and this book is based on a very important core system, it really makes even great parents take a closer look into their babys lil minds and why they do what they do. My daughter turned 2 today,I got the book 2 days ago and am finished and so happy to have it if i need to go back for a section. Thank you to the author.Parenting With Purpose : Progressive Discipline From Birth to Four"
2,Worked for the first months or so...,"The cord in the original power supply fatigued and broke a wire. Because the break was right at the end of the connector for the laptop, I had to buy a brand new power supply.This replacement worked great for the first few months that I owned it. However, it started to have issues after that. Initially, it was just an issue with excessive heat rise. This thing would get so hot you couldn't touch it. After that, it started charging intermittently. When it stops charging, I have to unplug it for approx 20 seconds.I guess you get what you pay for. This thing is made in China, and it shows."
3,Teac GF-680 Console Stereo,"Looks very nice, most of the features work great. Main problem is that the speakers are small, and there only two of them, and they are mounted below knee level. There are 2 RCA style plugs for external speaker, but they did not work. Had to open the back and hook up to the existing speakers. Once i attached 2 additional speakers at head level then the unit sounded great.For the price it is a great deal!"
5,Looks good and sounds great,Looks good and sounds great. Perfect for the 40+years person who no longers needs the big component stereo to blast their music throughout the neighborhood and just wants to listen to their music and match a non-hi-tec decor.
1,Congratulations... the first console as ugly as ludicrous pot bellied stoves,"With all the fantastic low slung mid-century modern designs you could have copied and improved on, you come up with THIS?!?!?!Teac, the people who want console stereos don't live in today's Victorian contemporary houses. They live in mid-modern houses, and current modern houses. (Not ""contemporary""; 50's, 60's, and 70's MODERN)People who live in these quasi-Victorian nightmare McMansions don't want console stereos or anything approaching modern technology ruining the 1890's effect. It's all built in and completely hidden behind wood paneled doors.Give you an ""A"" for effort here but an ""F"" for design and identifying intended audience.Try something low-slung and Danish next time. You'll even be able to work in usable speaker distances and sizes."
2,wrong size and plastic-like appearance,"These curtains do blackout all light, but do so by employing a cheap-looking product. When the material hangs, it is stiff and fails to flow naturally. They look more like a waterproof tarp than a normal fabric."
3,Careful measuring,"The overall product is a 5-Star, I went with 3 to warn when you measure be sure to leave an inch on each side as the ends of the mounting stick out more than the end of the bar. If you measure the exact amount and do not leave an allowance for this you will be frustrated as it will not fit. Otherwise a nice product."
3,Insight into the trial behind the scenes,"This book contains the diary entries of G.M. Gilbert, the chief psychiatrist at the Nuremberg trials. It can be a little bit dry at times, but offers a lot of insight into the defendants. This is not a book about the details of the trials- more so a recollection of how the defendants reacted to the trials and the conversations that took place among Gilbert and the defendants. Goering is portrayed with all his pomp and bluster, Ribbentrop in his absurdity and sense of self-importance, Rosenberg and others in their complete arrogance. It is a good read."
1,no CD-ROM,"i scored a ""1"" here just to get your attention.still studying for the NAPLEX, so i can't tell you how useful this book is; however, the edition Amazon.com sends you does NOT include the CD-ROM...despite the advertisement on the cover: ""FREE! CD-ROM ENCLOSED.""i tried twice with Amazon.[like you & I don't have enough guiac going on now, right?]so-- order from APhA, cause they are the ones that ""made"" this book, or...call the Publisher and ask for the REAL goods/ book + CD-ROM: 212-644-9696the CD-ROM has instilled HUGH confidence, and is worth the trouble pursuing."
4,A Worthwhile Collection of Quotations,"""The Sayings of Rudyard Kipling"" is a worthwhile collection of quotations form the most popular Anglophone writer of his age.The selections are divided into seven sections: Arts & Letters; Women & Love; England & The English; The Empire; Wars & Soldering; Lesser Breeds: Russians, Germans, Americans; and Wise Saws and Modern Instances.The Quotations range from the classic to the unfamiliar and from the insightful to the humorous. Whether you read it quickly or only a few quotations a day, this book can make your thought deeper, your writing richer and your speech wittier, and besides, it is just fun! This is a book to read at least once and to refer to often."
3,Packaging Sucked,"The block seals everything perfectly and provides a slight burn as feedback in areas that you cut or passed over too many times.Unfortunately, the block and the plastic case came broken... I bought this one mostly for the case and the size..."
5,A Fun happy book,"My son pick this book and we had a great day making it of dragons, we read the book, watched puff and magic dragon, and built a castle. This was a fun read. My put in his pile of books to be read over and over again.Book RecommendedWang Mind the greatest of the great pandasHappy animalsAlaska's ABC BearsChildren Make Terrible PetsFancy Nancy and the Delectable CupcakesThe Knight and The Dragon"
5,Utterly adorable.,"A charming story about an adorable dragon and little knight who feel they must fight as history tells them to. This book is just for fun and has lovely drawings of the dragon practicing being ferocious and the knight building his armor.Those seeking ""life lessons"" or wanting to apply major psychological motivations to the characters might look elsewhere and just enjoy this sweet story for what it is and the giggles that come forth."
1,where are the words?,i like to read to my 4 yr old. this hardly has any words. would not have purchased it had i known.
3,Picture Book,This knight had never fought a dragon nor the dragon fought a knight. They found books on fighting each other. The knight built armor for himself. And they fought. decent picture book in the knight genre.
1,"""That was a weird story""","I got it for my nephews along with two knight costumes and a castle tent for Christmas. Quote from my 5 year old nephew - ""that was a weird story"". It was weird - not many words, just pictures and a funny, but weird ending..."
5,A New Christian's guide to the Faith,"Bob Cook does a tremendous job of telling the new Christian all that he/she needs to know in the new life they've chosen. Not only does he give basic scripture passages that will help shape and guide them, he gives practical ways to put their new faith in action. This is a MUST HAVE for the new believer in Jesus - at a time when it is so vital for them to ""grow up in Christ."""
4,Out In The Streets,"His Band & Street Choir is a solid effort from Van Morrison. The album followed Moondance and while it's not as good as that album, it's still pretty darn good. ""Domino"" is a bouncy number that became his highest charting single peaking at number 9. ""Crazy Face"", ""Virgo Clowns"", ""Gypsy Queen"" and ""Call Me Up In Dreamland"" are all excellent songs. ""Blue Money"" is the best song on the album with it's neo doo-wop, r&b feel."
5,His best,"This is Van Morrisons best album in my opinion, and to my knowledge, his least popular (of his old stuff). This album even contains ""Domino"" which is on just about every best of album he has. A great bled of slow and upbeat songs that (to me) has better tracks than ""Moondance"" and ""Tupelo Honey"" (which are my other favorites). All in all, a great album from an incredibly undercredited musician."
3,Obviously not all written by Morris,"I checked out TAPS from the library on the basis of a short review in the NYTimes and because I loved the movie MY DOG SKIP. This book had some wonderful language but it was uneven. Maybe it could have been published as some short stories and not added onto to make a novel. The stories of bodies coming home from the Korean War and the playing of Taps was sorrowful, although I can't imagine that that many young men from one area would have died.I could not figure out Georgia's character at all. I was in high school during the 1950s and we didn't have anyone who acted like her. Of course we only see her though Swayze's eyes. I also didn't understand the final violent scene but it didn't disturb me so I guess the character of Luke had not been well drawn either.There is some beautiful language in TAPS. I wish it all would have been beautiful."
4,Picture of the Past,"Willie Morris has written a remembrance of the 50's in a small Southern town and environment that will present a picture to those that lived in the period and to those learning about what it was like in the ""old"" days. His use of the language is excellent and his discriptions of the land and nature plus his insight into the characterizations of the people are realistic and visual. An excellent story worth reading."
3,"Okay, but not great","Morris captured the ""Big Picture"" of how the Korean War affected a small town in Mississippi well, but his writing style was very inconsistent. The story is good and the narrator, Swayze is compelling, but I didn't find it worthy of more than three stars."
2,Quite tedious....with lousy ending,"This is a very slow paced story with really nowhere to go. The acting was quite atrocious, including Vivien Leigh's. Her performance was simply laughable and unconvincing, especially her reactions to Warren Beatty when he was being an ass to her. Beatty was definitely miscast, since his Italian accent was very bad, and he wasn't good looking enough to play an irresistible gigolo. Come on, why would rich American women lust after a scrawny, beady-eyed, fat lipped Beatty? The ending will just piss the hell out you after having spend so much time suffering through this mess."
2,Dated,"Having not seen this movie since it ws first released (in the 60's) I was disappointed. I think I saw it at a very impressionable time, and this could account for the disappointment. Neither Vivien Leigh nor Warren Beatty 'cut' it this time and Lotte Lenya's 'camp' performance is probably about the best part of it."
2,"Interesting Plot, Less Interesting Execution","The topic sounded very interesting, but the quality of the writing was disappointing. The quality of the exposition and dialogue was high-school quality. It did not make me want to read any more of her novels."
3,Cisco Kid,I remember watching this version of the Lone Ranger on t.v. with my dad. It's good holsom adventure with very inventive plots that make you cheer for the Cisco Kid and his sidekick Pancho. The only flaw to this particuler dvd is that you can see that some of the colorization is kind of screwy. They should have left in black and white cause it looks like a semi cheesy product put on dvd. It's fun but I really wouldn't recommend it unless you have the patience to accept the different colored prints in each episode.
1,"Sluggo pellets (same company) are OK. But if you like bees, avoid this spray. Spinosad and Imidacloprid hurt bees.","I don't have anything against the pellet type of Sluggo--it doesn't have Spinosad or Imidacloprid. I've been using the pellets and have heard from others that they work well.This particular product (the spray, which is made by the same company) has Spinosad, which is harmful for bees. If you haven't heard, the bee populations have been having a lot of trouble recently. There have been mass die offs of entire colonies and fruit farmers have started having to get their own bees.I thought anyone attracted to this product is probably interested in helping the bees and might not know about the harmful effects of Spinosad or Imidacloprid."
2,I've tried better,"Thought I'd give this product a go because of its ""safe for pets"" advertising. Unfortunately, it has not worked very well at all on our plants. After repeated applications of the Sluggo in the affected area, snails are still present and the plants are quickly becoming leaf-free. I'm going back to the major brands next time, and making sure pets stay away."
1,I'd like to slug Sluggo,This product did not work. I applied it as directed. I still have as many snails & slugs as I did before using this. I had such high hopes too as I have a dog & was excited to find something non-toxic that I could use and not have to worry about it affecting the dog. I understand that it takes a while for the slugs & snails to die from this but it has been 3 weeks and I'm still infested.
3,"Basically consistency of flour, can be washed away by rain","Should have bought Sluggo granules as they can last through a downpourThis powder is ok on hot weeks but not otherwiseIt works as long as you have sun, otherwise go for granules for a good slug cleanup"
4,Parent help,The book is great at helping you get your household organized so your kids know how to behave. It has helped me with one of my children. You still will need to have someone help you through issues that are unique to your house hold.
4,Great to have on hand,"I have adapted some of this for my own style and own chlid, but I am very pleased with the book overall. I refer to it every now and again when I need a refresher or need to change up my approach a bit because of my son's changing age and needs. I feel this book is a great base to work with. It was receommended to me by one of the best daycare/preschool teachers I know and I have receommended it to many people myself."
3,Not a good design,"Kind of a weird shaped design. I don't think I'll be wearing this, and for 10 bucks I won't be going through the hassle of returning it. Its new home will be in the donation bag."
3,Good read but no surprises,"Excellent read, but while Budiansky pretends he's presenting a radically new message, he actually kicks in a lot of open doors. No, the natural world is not really natural. No, ecosystems are hardly ever in equilibrium. No, indigenous peoples are not as nature-friendly as the noble savage myth wants us to believe. All these facts are generally accepted by ecologists, although they might be new to laymen. For some good old treehugger-bashing, buy it. To convince your all-too-romantic friends that conservation is not as simple as it seems, buy it. If you're an ecologist and you want to read something new, leave it."
4,A strong and powerful album that went unnoticed.,"This 1989 release was a superb set of smooth soul ballads that went mostly unnoticed thanks to hip-hop's domination of Urban Contemporary radio. ""I Won't Stop"", ""Why You Wanna Love Me Like That?"" and the gorgeous ""The Lady I've Been Waiting For"" are all Quiet Storm gems which justify looking for and (hopefully) finding this rare and underrated CD."
5,A good church resource,"We purchased this video to show the Easter Story to the children at our church. It was well done, connected modern day kids with ancient Biblical truths, and handled the crucifixion in an appropriate way for younger children. It kept the attention of the children, as well as the adults. A good resource to have at Easter."
3,"Decent, but kind of ""surfacy""","This movie presentation of the Easter story of Jesus was a bit shallow, and honestly I was pretty disappointed that it wasn't as spiritual as I had hoped it would be. It was more historical in scope and feeling, and I swear one of the character's voices is straight from Scooby Doo...the animation is similar in kind, too. It's not violent--my 4 year-old watches it just fine, but I was hoping for more of an emotional effect. The ""Jesus"" they presented in the story lacked depth and wasn't really that likeable or even developed as a character. I'm still searching for a good cartoon version of this story, basically."
5,A Thought-Provoking Book,"I am a college professor, and have always valued independent thinking in my students. Throughout my teaching career, I have striven for my students to see both sides of an issue. In this unique book, Woodmorappe shows that the care of thousands of animals on a literal Noah's Ark is no laughing matter. It can be seriously considered, whether or not one agrees with him."
4,"The Ark is history, not just a nice kids story!","Woodmorappe has done a tremendous amount of research and study to reinforce the view that the biblical account of Noah's flood can and should be regarded as actual history, not just an interesting story for kids. I give the book 4 stars because of the unique information it contains, but it is not easy reading. However, it is well worth the effort for those who want to seriously teach about the Ark and the flood, such as home school teachers, Sunday School or CCD teachers, and pastors."
5,Yummiest read you could imagine!,"Recently I watched a program on the Food Network that showed how Easter candy is made. There was nothing appetizing about the industrial pipes glurping out brown gunk, cesspool-like vats, and pinched-looking workers in clinical head coverings. And yet Steve Almond describes this same world and it shimmers with exquisite sensual detail. (Does the word ""enrober"" turn you on? It might after you read Almond's account of luscious sweets being cloaked in chocolate. Industrial? Not on your life.) I delighted in every aspect of this book, from the hilarious delineation of various candy addictions to the affectionate discussions of the confectionary creative process. Wonderfully stimulating to every human sense (including the sense of humor)."
1,No Joy with this Almond,"It does have a few humorous stories in it, but much of the content in this book isn't suitable for kids -- unless your last name is Osbourne. I thought the book was just about candy, but it's really as much about the author's philosophical and political views as anything else. Where it wasn't offensive, this much of book was downright boring and it's definitely not something I'd recommend to a person of any age group. Oh, and to the author, here's a hot tip: just because you eat candy doesn't mean you have to have bad teeth. Some new technology has come onto the scene in recent years that can help with that and you might want to look into it: it's called a ""toothbrush."""
4,For the Candyfrek in us all,Great book humor and a little over the top. Intresting aspect about the candy world and how the big companies like MARS are forcing the little guys the mon and pop business out of the business. Something about the original version of a deep dark chocolate melting in your mouth as you bite into the rich chocolate. Enjoy the writing and reading the book. I think the author needs help but we all have a passion for something candy was his and he had the cavities to prove it. Wonderful would recommended fun reading laugh out loud.
2,bitter and sour,"To us, these are bitter and sour in taste.We put jam and/or peanut butter on them and they seem to taste better."
5,Just what I was looking for:,"Needed a handle large enough to grasp easily if you were off balance, to be located outside. This turned out to be the one. Larger than most of the others I saw and with a finish which should resist rusting. Couldn't find it locally."
2,What?!!,"I've not read alot of books in the gay/lesbian genre, but I do know good reading, and this one was not a good one. The wife of the man who led a secret life was just too dumb for me. Not believeable."
5,Undercover,I loved this book. It seemed like it was part 2 to Fire and Brimstone. I read the book in like 2 days and I'm not a reader.
1,Overblown Special Edition,"I went to a lot of trouble to get this item special ordered to the store I work at. When it finally arrived yesterday, it wasn't sealed, so I peaked inside before purchasing, and what I found put me off:First off, it's in a HUUUUUGE box (bigger than my college calculus book) for only THREE DVDs. BIG. WASTE. OF. SPACE.Secondly, the fixtures which hold the disks are the kind which too easily let the disks loose, so they'd all come loose in shipping and arrived with the hell scratched outta them. I ran them through the disk resurfacing machine, but they still looked bad.The extras are cool, but they don't make up for the set's shortcomings--not even with the nice employee discount I would get. I'm going to look for the individual releases instead."
1,Did not work for my computer had to go back to the old one. I did not return it.,The number was what we were told would work. It was a lot smaller and Would not bring up my computer. I give it a very poor rating If they had told me it was like that I would not have order it. I would have tried something larger..
1,smh horrible,So i used this product for the first time in about 2 years and it didnt do no wonders. The wax strips are so damn thin that when you put the wax on the area and then put the strip on its all over your damn hands. You would think they would supply all the stuff for it. I never had a problem with gigi waxer until today and I am very disappointed. I have thick hairs on my eyebrows (which i used the product for) and it didnt take anything off. I used this also in cosemetology school and i never had a problem. !!!!!! My eyebrows hurt so much from trying to do this twice and im beyond pissed that I have to walk around with puffy eyebrows
3,Good to save some money...,"So I bought the waxing kit so that I wouldn't have to spend $10 every time I wanted to get my eyebrows waxed. Unfortunately, I ended up with waxing too much of my left brow at one point, but it still looked okay. Point being, maybe getting your eyebrows done by a profesional is worth it, especially if you don't have a steady hand. In my case, I'd rather take the risk and save some money..at least I think it's worth it."
4,Gigi is great!,"This is a great, money-saving set. I use it all the time. This is my 2nd Gigi waxing kit actually. The first one lasted many, many years and saved me tons of money! The only slight glitch is the products that come with it. The wax is fine but I am already set in my preferences for strips and applicators so I prefer wider versions, on both counts. Still.. for the price, this is an awesome buy!"
2,Do your research first,"I learn my lesson after I purchased this and that is to research the movies before you buy them online. I remember watching this movie on cable years ago and I remember some of the scenes but I didn't realize how boring this movie was until watching like ten minutes of it. I thought there was more sex scenes in this movie because i could have sworn there was. This movie had very little sex scenes and I don't think this is the right movie. If I were you, I wouldn't buy this DVD, part 7 is better than this."
1,"Don't order it, and if you did, return it!","There may be a good version of Emmanuelle 4 out there, but it wasn't this one! Though the actors are speaking in English, it is all dubbed, and very poorly. The photography is washed out at times. The music is really bad. The sound shifts volume, and there is one segment several seconds long with no sound at all. There is no plot whatsoever, the acting is atrociously bad, the film is an editing nightmare (by the director, or the company releasing a heavily censored video, I don't know). I even had trouble tracking this film, and when I rewound, I got a blue screen. How did Sylvia Krystel, whose first two Emmanuelles were classy, thoughtful, and truly erotic films, get sucked into this mess? Maybe the French version is better. But I'm returning this one!"
1,Low quality propaganda movie,Very low quality propaganda movie. Looks like it was paid by the Georgian government. Don't waste your time. Typical war scenes - nothing new from cinematography prospective
3,Great Music - Bad CD,"The music is great!!! However there are several tracks that ""drag"" in certain parts. I gave the CD as a gift and she didn't want to return it. The quality of the CD is not the best but, again the music is awsome."
3,Silent Players,"I was a little disappointed with this book. It contained too many personal and general comments. Mary Brian is a friend and so she gets a glowing description of her ability. What the Silent Era needs is a factual enclyopaedia of the stars. This should include list of films, popularity polls, contemporary critics views written at the time the films first appeared. And more detail of how and why stars careers faltered. I also find it depressing how Mr Slide so dismissive of actors and films that makes me wonder whether he really likes Silent Films. He is not alone with this ie Kevin Brownlow's ""The parades Gone By"" is another example. I feel we are getting half a story."
4,"Good, but a little too silly.","This is a great book to get if you're interested in kissing history, kissing games, recipes named for kisses and kissing trivia, but it is not, as the title suggests, a book devoted to kissing techniques. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few different types of kissing techniques to try, but only a few stood out as interesting, appetizing and practical enough to add to my repertiore, (although they did get good reviews!) I get the feeling they were really reaching to make it to 500 kisses. One of them, for example, involved licking your partner's face clean. However, there isn't anything x-rated in it, so shy people may benefit from it without being embarassed, and a lot of them will surprise your partner and get them laughing, which is always good."
2,Has about a third of the charge as the original battery,"I bought this to be a replacement for the B-2L battery that came with my Canon camera. The good news is that it fits fine. The battery has been cycled about 25 times now and, at best, has about 1/3rd the charge as the Canon battery. I use it for an emergency backup battery. In that role, it is acceptable."
3,typical SyFy fare,"This is your basic SyFy movie, take a remotely scientific idea and just run with it. The disaster scenes are the best ones, but the storyline doesn't really impress, and some of the actions in response to the cold were dumb, I'd know better what to if I was stuck in a place like this, and there's also the predictable rescue scene and cute pet that survives death. If you're bored and enjoy the cheesiness of SyFy movies, you should enjoy this one. I can't advise buying it unless you see it first."
3,Theories of Human Communication,"It is a very intense book on multiple communication theories. Also a very good book if a person is studying in the communications field. Although, the overviews of each theory is brief, it makes room for most communication theories in the field. (For more in-depth information on some theories, you would want to consult a Communications Journal.)"
5,Great christmas music...,"Love this cd, i'm 24years old and for as long as I can recall my mom would put this during Christmas time an I love it. the cd over the years got lost. So I got it on amazon to replace it. Can't see having Christmas with out it.. PS Thanks mom for putting classic Christmas music in my ears..."
3,Pretty good,Not the easiest to install but certainly doable with all the right tools... and the nickle plating is not the exact match to other nickle plated Schlag locksets.
5,Funnier than the First,To fans of Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro - you do not want to miss this film. On a scale of 1-10 it comes in at 10 plus! The gags are absolutely hilarious and one can tell that these two lead characters are really enjoying themselves immensely! Lisa Kudrow's sarcasm quips were priceless! Sure it looks like a takeoff on the Soprano's but with more of a comedic theme. It being a matter of choice - my husband and I agree that this was superb!
1,How many F_ words can you fit into a movie?,"Robert De Niro is my favorite actor, and it pains me to see him in this unfunny, vulgar, insipid movie. The screenwriter strained to insert the F_ word into every sentence, whether the situation calls for it or not. Wit is replaced by vulgarity. I laughed only once throughout the entire movie. A total waste of acting talent and my time."
3,Do we really need analysis of this silly thing?,"There were lots of laughs in this movie at times, but the vulgarity could have been lessened or omitted for a good portion of this movie. Billy Crystal is no Richard Dreyfus (as in WHAT ABOUT BOB) but he was delightful just the same. The old guy could have been good.The actor who carried this movie was the one trying to be a director of a movie within the movie. I could not tell from the credits (very unsettling with all those goofs playing at the same time) who this marvel was. Hope he will be a star in his next film."
3,A Few Good Laughs,"Analyze That features two good performances from Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro. Its kind of refreshing to see De Nero doing comedic work. The parts where De Nero's character acts out scenes from West Side Story are quite funny. Crystal gives us his usual amusing schtick about self guilt particulalry in the relationships with his late father and wife.The story however is helter skelter where De Nero's mob boss character seems to shift gears too much from amusing fool to hard ass mob boss and all points in between. This can be more annoying than funny although there are some cute moments. However, there is little variation from the Jelly's character gives the film a light hearted touch.Therefore, this movie stands in the middle of the pack."
2,OK movie made aweful for its language,"This was an amusing movie, but the language is 100% gutter. I have a household full of children and we don't speak in gutter talk. I guess mobsters do. I am half Italian, so i defineately mean Mobsters, not Italians. Rounded down from 2.5 stars to 2 stars for language.I liked both movies otherwise and warmed to the De niro character.I Actually liked Analyze That a little better than Analyze This. Now that I've seen them once, I see no need to see them again. So, get the kiddies out of the room and bring home the rental or buy one of those wireless headsets and turn off the sound."
3,Analyze That,"Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal return as mobster Paul Vitti and psychiatrist Dr. Sobel. In five minutes it reminds you of pretty much every running gag from the first movie, in fine fashion. Which is funnier? That's a BS question, Joel Siegel. Both are a pleasure. This film manages to trot out the tired old ""gangsters want to make movies about gangsters"" gimmick without boring me. I suspect I didn't appreciate Jelly enough the first time around. He's awesome."
1,Why did they bother ?,"When you see the stars of this movie laughing silly in the out-takes shown during the end credits, you realize immeadiately this is one of those movies in which the actors had a much funnier time making the film, than the audience had watching it.I absolutely loved ""Analize This"" but ""That"" is a waste of time."
3,PR music,The cd is great it has a great variation of rythms and makes you want to dance the first time you here it.
2,TOO IVORY TOWER - Lacks info on real experiences in DPRK,"Unfortunately the book is based on academic and Washington DC think tank sources opposed to actual research in North Korea. A more useful approach would have been for the book to be based on actual recent research in North Korea as well as other transitioning economies in Asia such as Vietnam, Laos and Mongolia. Access and visas to these countries, as well as to North Korea, can be made in Beijing from which there are easy flights. North Korea is a fascinating country and well worth the visit. It is disappointing that this book, like so many others today, rely on secondary sources instead of direct research. This seems to be a trend among American books from Washington DC. Perhaps in Europe we have different set of standards for our academic research so maybe I am being unfairly critical."
5,"Economics, Politics and Security","This is a remarkably well-written book, enjoyable to read while scholarly and comprehensive. Noland addresses both north and south Korea, and the timing of the book is excellent, given that recent events in Korea have focused world attention there. The book's approach integrates economics with politics and security, rare in volumes like this. In addition, the writing style itself is appealing, with drolly humorous observations and insights imbedded in the text."
3,Yes and No,"First of all i want to say that i'm a huge fan of BP publications. The thing is, from this dvd i didn't learn more than from the Monzon's one (basic afro-cuban rhythms). There were no tips on Scales or melodic aproach, and very little talk about harmony and form. i kinda was hoping a real master class, and i didnt get one, not a ""master"" one at least.But it's not done badly or poorly, and the loops are very interesting. the concert is the best thing of this DVD.IT IS CODED FOR ALL REGIONS, since all the BP dvds are done that way (that being checked here in southamerica)Sheet music IS AVAILABLE from BP site to download."
5,Nice Storage,This is a great way to store your blades without taking up a lot of space. Now I don't worry about slicing my finger digging through a drawer to find them!
3,returned it,i had mistakenly ordered this along with the 14 cup cuisinart food processor. Obviously the holder was too small and then I realized the processor I ordered came with a case!
1,Unimaginative patterns; assumes reader knows nothing about knitting,"This is one of the most disappointing knitting books I've ever purchased. I expected patterns that would highlight the beauty of ribbon yarns but all I got were a bunch of basic patterns for purses, halter tops, square cushions, etc.Author assumes that her reader does not know how to knit; at least a quarter of the pages in the book are how-tos that apply to any kind of yarn."
3,If you like to knit with Ribbon yarn...,"This is another book that I saw in a shop and thought the price was ridiculous. I only liked a few of the patterns so I wasn't going to spend over $25 on 2 - 3 patterns. So I looked it up on Amazon, saw a much better price and purchased it. I am glad I did. I made 2 of the patterns in the book and was very pleased. If you like to knit with ribbon, you will like this book."
5,A Favorite!,"My 18 month old nephew loves this book and looks at it all day long. He sleeps with it and takes it with him on trips. It's getting worn out from all the use, and we'll need to buy him a fresh copy of it soon."
5,My son won't put it down!!,"This book goes everywhere with my 23 month old. He sleeps with it, goes to daycare with it, and it's even traveled on a plane to California with us clutched in his hands. The book is a bit beat up, so I'm back to buy another one or two to make him happy."
3,Good for the price,"Excellent for the price. The only downside would be that the fan on has two speeds and the light only has one setting. My old fan had three setings for the light and fan speed. Other than that, the stainless steel matches my fridge and dishwasher, it looks great!! Compared to other prices, it's excellent!!"
4,Brushed Nickel Towel Ring...,"During a recent bathroom remodel I needed a towel ring for a decorative towel. The Moen DN8486BN fit my needs and did so with modern day style. The brushed nickel is attractive and matches nicely with the cabinets hardware that I got from another supplier. The construction is solid and the quality is excellent. The base is a cup and saucer design. An unfinished mount screws to the wall with two screws(drywall anchors included), then the base(cup) slips over the mount and tightens down with a small flat-head set screw. The ring is solid and has no slop between the ring and the base. The only thing I didn't like about this piece is the plastic sleeves that are between the base and the ring. The plastic is there to tighten up the ring so that it doesn't flop around but the plastic itself is a small eyesore."
5,"Very nice, well constructed Towel Ring","Towel Ring functioned extremely well with the matching toilet paper holder. I paired the two with at Gatco Chrome Towel Bar and the set looks fantastic. Moen makes very nice, easy to install bathroom hardware."
3,it's pretty good,"The only thing is it looks a little bit cheaper than what i found in the actual home depot store. also, i thought i was ordering ""inspritations"" to match what i got at HD but much cheaper on amazon. however, i received ""Preston"" line which looks a little cheaper, but only at a close glance. it worked out for us b/c we were able to swap one O-Ring and have everything within each bathroom match, but our original goal was to have the same ones in the whole house. now granted, no one will probably ever notice even if they were looking for it unless they're in the top 99 percentile of observant. the product itself could be 4 or 5 stars in my book, but out of principle i am not please that they advertised one line, and i was sent another."
1,this movie suck i tought this might be good,this is nick cannon firstaction & aventure\comedy roeyln sancjez lookin okay
3,Good Family Movie,Not to say this is the best Moive out there but its a real good Family film ** Nick Cannon and the rest do a good Job ** the store is nice ** My dad enjoyed it with me.
1,UNFUNNY PIECE OF GARBAGE,CHRISTINA MILIAN is smart lady for dumping nick cannon unfunny ass.UNDERCLASSMAN IS JUST AWFUL BUT ANYFILM NICK IS IN SUCK.ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU ARE SO RICH AND FELT LIKE FLUSHING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET.
3,"Pretty good for mixed use, but...","Ok, first this is not a true HD set (720 not 1080) and the video scaling is sub-par. Lots of heat from panel. It does have a myriad of connection options and it works reasonably well as a computer monitor (when set to 4:3 mode). Had this about three weeks now and it is generally a very good mixed use (PC/TV) panel at a very good price. If you are looking for picture clarity and quality for just TV use, look elsewhere, ghosting occurs in action movies and games and even with progressive scan hook up for DVDs, picture is average. Sound quality is fantastic compared to most sets but headphone jack is in back of set (hard to reach)."
3,China made,Not the French version but they are nice to have to serve soup during special occasions. These are not heavy-duty ones like the French Le Ceuset cooking gear but for the price it works. Just wish it wasn't made in China.
3,Decent leash system,"Decent system, but I don't like how the attachment is free to slide around the belt portion of the leash. You get two attach points but there's no way to keep them in place and my dog always manages to get them slipped around directly in front of me."
5,Nice Album!!!,"I love this album. Some of the songs are already released in GRP CHristmas Collection II, an album that is not available. I love the Tom Scott version of José Feliciano""s Feliz Navidad..."
5,Kudos to a Woman's guide to sleep.,"Although targeted specifically towards women, the book has much in it for everyone in their quest for a good night's sleep.Written in an accessible style it is based on sound science and (apparently) countless hours of research. The book was a gift for someone who has benefitted greatly from the advice inside. Highly recommended!"
3,"Certainly different, but good","In relation to the rest of Richard D. James' influential and broad discography, ""Analogue Bubblebath 3"", lacking any comprehensible titles, is often overlooked. The tracks on the album generally consist of a mish-mash of styles, including industrial, acid-madness, ambient and just plain bizarre. Some of my favourite ""classic"" RDJ tracks are found here, most notably tracks 1, 4, 6 and 8. However, the best thing about the album is the mystery surrounding it. With the minimalist packaging, and lack of ""official"" titles"", the listener really has not a clue whatsoever as to how, or even why, the album was made. Obviously Richard does though, and the album exists as another key to trying to understand the man and his music."
4,Digital Circuit Breaker Finder,Pros: Saves time trying to match up outlets to breakers.Cons: Patience is a virtue when scanning the breakers.Conclusion: Great time saving tool when you want to label your unmarked circuit breaker in a new house.
1,It Must Be Magic,I have tried this product several times and it has yet to function has advertised. IMO it is a ripoff. Just yesterday I thought it had gained my respect when it beeped atop a breaker during the second pass. This tool is dyslectic because the breaker was located on the opposite side of the panel lower down.
2,barely usable,Very limited sensitivity. Metal cover over breakers would have to be removed and even then it might not pick-up signal. ON switch is also too easy to accidently turn on.
1,Poor design and does not work!,The design of the unit is terrible. The power button is incredibly sensitive and ends up turning on and killing the battery while in your tool bag.The unit does NOT work well for residential use in sniffing out breakers. This device is a real piece of garbage that I ended up returning.
2,fascinating retro-driven pop,"on this record the verve sound an awful lot like a looser, funkier version of barret-era pink floyd. each of the songs is a little gem save for 'endless life' goes precisely nowhere. the shorter version of the title track on the group's eponymous EP is probably more satisfying, but the other numbers are exciting ('man called sun' is a vast improvement over the studio version)."
5,absolutely lovely,What a great surprise! Thoroughly enjoyed the first episode and looking forward to seeing more! Great story line and interesting characters.
5,Love those Cranford Ladies!,"I was incredibly entertained. Great cast, great acting with compassionate performances. I can't wait to get back to my TV and continue!!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I discovered Cranford while spending a few days recovering from a cold. It is a wondefully done period piece. The acting was well done, not over the top which might have been easy to do with some of the characters. The story line was interesting, funny and sad at times..but not too much. I was sad to come to the end of the series."
4,The Last One,"I enjoyed this series of books written about The Texas Confidential team that operates as a clandestine team to right the wrongs in this world we live in. While it isn't the CIA, FBI or Interpol, it works in many similar ways. Wonderful heroes, great leading ladies. I would like more of these kinds of stories!"
4,Accurate and Applicable to To Current Times,"Its a Practical Book, that applies to the most desperate of situations. Its recipes are safe for ther average IQ person to apply. It covers alot on IMPROVISED METHODS and will not leave you helpless. Its name isnt solely its contents. It also covers the Basics tha are often Missed in HOW BOOKS. [...]"
3,Good but not the best,"My first exposure to Mr. Schwaber's work on Agile development was through one of his later books,Agile Project Management with Scrum (Microsoft Professional). I would recommend that other book more highly than this. This one conveys more of the history of how Scrum developed through practice and for that it is a good resource. Knowing why some aspects are not included and having the benefit of the author's train of thought on the topic is useful. But it can also be cumbersome to sift through those lessons learned without the book seeming a bit disorganized. Therefore, if you have time for only one book on this topic, I would recommend the other mentioned. A good resource but not the best from Mr. Schwaber."
5,Best tool when implementing Scrum,"I've been a ScrumMaster for over 3 years now, and I still use this book on a constant basis (that's my fault, not the book's!). :)While there are newer books, including Scrum for Project Managers by Ken, I find this book to be the closest to the cookbook many people want and need when implementing new methodologies and processes.If you're thinking about implementing Scrum, this is the one book you cannot afford to pass over.Good job Ken!"
3,"Everybody loves this book, but...","...the book itself isn't really that great. SCRUM has some very interesting ideas about managing a software project, but the book is just OK. I seem to remember him saying that ""it was done quickly, just in time for a conference"" on his blog at one point. However, if you're going to try some SCRUM, you'll want to read this.Additionally, you'll need this book if you're going to read his other SCRUM book (Agile Project Management w/ SCRUM) from Microsoft Press, because you'll want the background from this book for that one.One thing that is not covered in this book is how you get management approval when you have a ""process by not having a process,"" or how SCRUM might scale to more that 7-11 people (other than a SCRUM of SCRUMs.)"
4,I like it,"This game is a Christmas gift for my son so I don't know if it will work. It arrived with many fingerprints, but once I cleaned the CD it looked like it was in good shape. I was a little disappointed that it was not in the boy displayed other than that I like it. The shipping was fast, it arrived sooner than expected."
4,Fun game for PC,"This is a repurchase of the game that we had purchased a few years ago for our 8 year old. The original CD simply stopped working, and we repurchased it from amazon.com for a very inexpensive price. Unfortunately, now that he is 11 with an XBox, PC games are not so cool any more. But lots of fun for younger kids racing exotic cars through fantasy terrains. Excellent graphics."
1,No Bloopers...Just Bad Playing,I also saw this video. i bought it for 2.99 at best buy. it was terrible. it showed a bunch of old major indoor soccer league clips. there was hardly anything worthy of being called a blooper. we could only laugh at how lousy it was.
2,Just ordinary...,This is the first mystery book I read and I really didn't feel anything extraordinary.. the plot is so predictable and it unfolds in an ingenious way.. no surprises .. no excitement ..Jacobs' writing style is probably what made me continue reading it.. I liked the way she draws her characters .. simple and skillful.
4,Murder Among Strangers,"Kate Austin is a single mom with a 6 y.o. daughter of her own, a teenager Libby, who would be called a ward in an old Victorian novel (she is the daughter of a friend who passed away)and a live in significant other, Michael. Michael is a homicide dectective for the local police department. She stops to help a stranger and accidently uncovers a crime. As the old saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished, Kate is kidnapped and that is just the beginning. Any number of twists and turns, including Kate under suspicion of murder, carry us through this book. Most of the story follows Kate, but periodically we also follow Micheal as he struggles to solve Kate's problem and a few of his own. It is well told and fast paced."
2,In Response to the only other person who has seen this show,"The answer to your question, is Turner Home video did that with all of the WCW shows back then. It's sad but true. I guess they thought they'd save money on butchering up there Pay Per Views. As a pay per view collector... I agree, it's very annoying. My hope is that with WWE owning all of this, that eventually they will produce this stuff in the future. They make a killing on DVD sales... and there are plenty of WCW fans that probably would buy this crap (like me lol). With the latest release of the WrestleMania collection, that tells me that they are going to start producing older stuff on DVD, at least I hope thats what it means."
5,I think it is excellent,I bought as a complement to Bob Brister's book. Bob teaches the science of shooting. Peter shows how to become a better shooter. Read both.
5,Very Handy!!,"Okay..I am one of those people who dismissed Tupperware as an overpriced alternative to plastic dishware that can be purchased in discount stores..well..no more. Tupperware is much better made than ""that other brand"", and you get what you pay for...quality that lasts a lifetime. Every single piece of ""microwave"" Tupperware I have ever bought is WONDERFUL...including these mugs. No more splatters!! These mugs are very durable and the vented seal prevents splattering in the microwave..great for warming soup, mac and cheese and pasta products (ie spaghetti-o's). I have even made mini cakes and oversized muffins in these in no time flat. They clean up great in the dishwasher, and are the perfect size (16 oz). I use this item AT LEAST 4x a week, so it is not some novelty item collecting dust in my cabinets. I also recommend Tupperware's microwave steamer (another item I use several times a week)."
3,Fun domestic psycho-thriller but not particularly memorable,"The Practice of Deceit starts off with a bang. Eric Lavendar, a Manhattan psychotherapist, is being held in jail for his wife's accusations that he molested their daughter. The plot then unfolds back and forth through time as Eric describes how he met his wife and how their marriage has evolved through the last 4 years. Benedict is a strong writer and the fast pacing of the book is great. Oddly, there were no major plot twists. I was a bit disappointed in the tame and predictable ending. As domestic fiction, the PoD is quality writing and a great light fun read. As a thriller it lacks and doesn't really compare to writers like Harlan Coben or Greg Iles."
1,THIS IS A VEGETARIAN BOOK,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you are a vegetarian or willing to change to one! I bought this book along with ""Fat-Burning Foods and Other Weight-Loss Secrets."" The title is very deceiving. While it does give you information on the fat and calorie content on certain foods, it does not give you advice on how to balance your meals if you eat meat; this book is just telling you not to eat any animal product or saturated fats. That's it!!! If you are thinking about either of these books, I would definitely prefer ""Fat-Burning Foods and Other Weight-Loss Secrets."" It has more information, and it doesn't stop you from eating meat!!!"
3,Some good info,"I chose this rating because its mostly vegetarian and has a lot of tofu, yogurt info. I am not a tofu or yogurt person and I do not drink milk, as I don't like it and get ill from it. I do not use any dairy or non dairy products other than some cheese. I did like the info on fruits, nuts, and vegetables. I also do eat lean red meat, poultry, pork and fish. We buy organic as much as possible and eat fresh or frozen. I buy very little processed foods. As I said there's good info in this book and someone leaning toward the vegetarian lifestyle would really like it, so yes I would recommend it for them."
4,How did they manage to make the original Formula even better!!?,"This thing is fantastic! It works- tried and true like ALL Head & Shoulder's shampoo's. But man, it smells fantastic! May be the Almond Oil but it's a great shampoo and I will be using it forever and ever."
3,It has its ups & downs,"This product is excellent for people that have itchy and/or dry scalp. It has helped mine tremendously. However, I give it only 3 stars because it did not go well with my color treated hair. And though it is listed on the back that it is safe with colored hair, it definitely faded it out very fast. I could see the color coming out in the shower. So I caution that for anyone else who has color treated hair. Otherwise, I think its a great product and it smells great!"
4,Great childhood memories,"This DVD-set brings back great childhood memories, the first episodes of this series are the best I think, I used to watch them over and over again when I was at the age of 8. The video quality isn't constant and differs from episode to episode as is the audio quality. In some episodes there are colour problems and a few audio pops here and there but hey that is to be expected from a show that aired in the early 80s. Overall I'm totally satisfied with this set and I sincerely hope that they release the whole series."
4,An incredible album by an incredible band,"This album would have definitly recieved a 5 from me if not for the poor songs on the Sentence of Death. C'mon just look at the cover, they look like Motley Crue! But man, these guys can play (unlike the despised Crue)! Satan's Vengeance and Devil's Soldiers are both decent tracks, but when you get to Invincible Force, there's an obvious change in music quality as well as production and from there it just gets better. Thrash Attack is one of the best instrumental's I've ever heard. The Ritual, Bestial Invasion, and Black Death are all just plain amazing. This album is fantastic, and should be in every thrash fan's collection!"
4,Very Nice Hat!,"A very well made hat. The materials and workmanship are very high quality and the styling is masculine yet more refined than many ""sun hats""Pluses: High quality weave, finish and form. Crown ventilation is supurb. Leather headband looks sharp and the leather chin strap is very supple and very functional.Minuses: The straw is fairly rigid and can crack if crushed. The fit is generalized so padding will probably need to be added (not provided) between the sweatband and crown for a good fit."
5,Fun and easy read,This is a very motivating book. I shared it with my team of guest service reps at our hospital and they loved it. It is a fun read and a great discussion piece.
2,Fred Factor Reviews...?,"I purchased this book based on the great reviews and the promising title. Reading is a passion of mine and usually once I start a book I finish it quickly, but this has been a painful read. Honestly, it is boring and I do not find the content very helpful. I am happy for the other readers that have gotten something out of their purchase, but I just don't ""get"" what other readers find so wonderful about this book. Be nice, be thoughtful, do more than others expect of you and don't expect something in return, try to touch other's lives in a positive way- there I just saved you some money."
2,The Fred Factor,"Not an easy read, kind of slow. There is some good advice that we already know, but just don't utilize. I still haven'r finished reading."
3,ending saves the book,"I wasn't particularly impressed with this book. It was good enough to keep reading, but it wasn't until the ending (don't worry I won't say what happens) that I really started to like it in spite of myself, hense the 3 stars. The characters are generally likeable. Ellie is a little too obsessive about her weight and too self-depreciating. It starts to get annoying. The plot also seems a little thin (no pun intended)."
2,10 year old wouldn't take them,"These chewable wafers are larger than I expected...just a little smaller than the size of a quarter. My 10 year old daughter just couldn't stand chewing them. We couldn't get one down much less the recommended two. I am glad they work for others, just not us. For now we will just stick with our omega supplements, they seem to help her behavior and focus. We take the lemon lime Coromega and she loves the flavor."
4,My son actually told me that he feels this helps him,"My son is flighty, inattentive and subject to mood swings. We recently discovered that he is Vit D3 deficient so I began exploring alternative therapies including choline and Omega 3 EPA. We are very pleased with the results after one month. My only negative comment is that I have to alternate between 2 and 3 pills every other day to give him 150 MG or cut the wafer in half. It would be nice if they adjusted the wafer so each wafer contained 75mg. Good luck!"
2,"If you liked M.D. and Evidence, you'll hate Mere Mortals","The only possible excuse for this book is that the events actually happened to author Neil Ravin and he had to write the novel to free himself from the past. The outcome of the book is so heavily foreshadowed by both the first chapter and the use of lines from James Taylor's song Fire and Rain, that it comes as no surprise. Most disappointing is the lack of medical detail that was so delightful in M.D. and Evidence; this is simply a love story where the characters just happen to be a doctor and nurse."
5,I wish I had this when I was in college.,This book covers the basics (and not so basics) of copy writing in a clear way that makes sense. It is easy to understand and has made a difference in my work almost immediately. It covers topics that forces you to rethink in a productive way. Bravo to the author for a job well done.
5,Almost perfect,"I have used this grill for 10 yrs. now. It's always outside, uncovered. From N. Indiana winters to W. Tennessee summers, it's still solid. I have cleaned and repainted the outside twice with grill paint. The inside gets re-seasoned only. Don't be fooled by the much cheaper import immitations. Poor draft controll makes it useless as a ""low and slow"" smoker. The thin metal warps and can rust through in short order. If you take reasonable care of this Brinkman, it should last a life time."
2,"I get it, but that doesn't make it any less ridiculous","Post-modernism isn't appreciated as such in the truly post-modern era. This book may have inspired and launched a thousand novels in succeeding generations, but outside of aspiring modern writers who need either justification or inspiration, it really has no place. It's irrelevant, completely unfunny, and as unintellectual as a neo-con's talking points.My bias: Joyce and Sterne belong in the same bowl to be devoured by artists and fellow writers and happily ignored by most consumers of literature. Maybe we aren't smart enough to enjoy it, but we are intelligent enough to get it. It's just not that fun to struggle through. These are mostly pointless words penned as amusement and should be treated as such. There's little of humanism to reveal here, so let it be what it is: the recreation of a mind unburdened by survival or love. Too bad so much ink was spilled on so little substance."
1,Exaggerate violence!,"This movie has an exaggerate and free violence. I don't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to watch a young boy killing other people for any reason and his girfriend watching these scenes as she were watching TV. I believe there was a better way to tell Starkweather's life."
1,For those who need no footnotes,"This book proved entirely opaque to me: there were so many technical matters presented with no clarification for the non-specialist, and these often matters of life and death for the subs discussed, that I set aside the book in bafflement."
2,Not very good.,"The nail polish color was beautiful, but it takes at least five coats to get a good, solid color. When I opened this product, the polish was very runny, and the color had separated. And every time that the color sits for more than 10 minutes, the color starts to separate again. I wish I had tried the polish sooner, so that I could return it for a different bottle."
5,A Tragic / Inspiring Album tribute to her killed Matador,"I lived in Valencia Spain in 1986 for 6 months and this album was played all the time. Isabel Pantoja's husband was a matador who was killed in the bullring during a fight, and this album traces the year in her life following her husband's death. This album brings you full circle of her grief and is truly moving. Her voice is beautiful and the story itself is a movie. For the American equivalent of these Spanish artists, it would be as if Robert Redford was married to Barbara Streisand - both are famous in their own rights and certainly beautiful, talented people. Her Sevillana voice never sounded better! All the grief culminates to a message of hope for continuing her journey in life. Buy it, enjoy it, and remember your blessings."
2,Deep thoughts in the English countryside or writers conceit?,"This book didn't fill me with any deep insights except possibly into Naipaul's conceit. Despite some occasional beautiful description this book doesn't do much. Naipaul's pontifications on the ""common people"" approach the truly condescending as he attempts to ""understand"" them. And yet it all seems geared as a justification for his own preoccupied ruminations. I just don't think it's Naipaul's best which is when he's got a real story to tell, his own or someone else's. I'm just not that interested in Naipaul's thought processes. Or maybe I just don't like them, either way he's written better. Possibly if he wasn't so self absorbed and inherently elitist I could like him better. When he uses his sharp mind for a better purpose he writes more interesting books."
3,King or Queen????,"It says it is a King Quilt but the shams are standard size and it fits like a Queen Quilt. I have a Queen size bed where it can be used so it wasn't all that disappointing. It's attractive and worth maybe $50.00, more decorative than providing any warmth. I just opened it last night so can't say how it washes.I think it is mislabled. The one I got says King but it is not nearly as large as my King Size Quilt (from Pottery Barn). It's the quality one might expect at a discount store for $50."
3,Not bad,"The speakers are fine just to get by, I wasn't really expecting anything fancy for the price, but both of the covers for the speakers were cracked. I wasn't planning on using the covers anyway because of how I mounted them, although when you pay money for something new you should expect it to, at the very least, NOT be broken."
2,Hammy,"Came on time,and they worked great, till one went out. Found out that where you connect them was faulty, i swaped them out for a set i had lieing around.While i had these they were good just wasnt made correctly other wise its a good buy."
4,Good cheap speakers!,These speaker perform quite well in my 2002 grand am as a replacement for the orginal monsoon speakers
2,Do these speakers fit any car?,"I used the guide amazon offers to figure out what will fit in my car and these speakers where supose to fit in both (2) cars I have, and they actually wont fit in iether. Im very disapointed. I should have rated only one star, but its not the speakers fault they didn't write up the codes for what will fit and what will not. (06 honda pilot, and a 95 Mitsubishi Mirage)"
1,Horrible.,"I bought these knowing they were cheap and most likely not to good quality. But the horrible quality blew my mind... After receiving them I read the reviews, I know not a smart idea. But I was desperate bc one of my factory speakers had blown and was getting on my nerves.. but at this rate, I should have just left it. One of them blew already, and I hardly turned them up... the volume of these speakers are extremely low, I now hear the speaker in the back that is blown, louder than I do the new ones.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR $20! Next time I will wait till my next check and add some more $$ to my speaker fund! UGH!!!!!"
1,1 left,got these always remember you get what you pay for these speakers are crap just like everything else boss sells if ur gonna spend 20 bucks save up a lil more and buy name brand
2,Boss,Had speakers for just about a month now and one still works and the other has blown is their a way to return item and receive a new set of two
2,pretty lame,"I thought boss was a decent company made by roland but these are the bottom of the line, they cant handle much power, not loud enough, no bass. they look cool but sound like junk."
1,boater,Don't buy these unless your running an amp. They need power to sound good. Stock head unit sounds like trash. Go with alpine or polk audio speakers if you want great sound with any type of power.
4,Great speakers for the price..,"These speakers were exactly what I was looking for. They sound great and look great in my speaker box. Yes the wires are very thin, so I replaced them with a thicker gauge but all in all, for the the price, you can't go wrong with these."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!,"I bought these just to put in my work car...the old 4x6s blew, so i bought these. I would never purchase a 4x6 speaker to begin with, but since it was just my work car i wasnt worried about it. Well...not only did i prove to myself to just buy an adapter and drop a 6 inch speaker in i proved these BOSS speakers are complete garbage. They the worst speakers i have ever posessed. They are very light weight, feel trashy and sound trashy. Not to mention they went out the 4th day i had them....on a low volume...dont buy these.."
4,Okay speakers,the highs on the speakers are great...but the lows are destorted..not ideal for bass at all....figured they just need a little longer to break in but had them over two weak and still the bass sucks....but okay for a cheap replacement.
4,Boss Audio CH6950 6-Inch x 9-Inch 5-Way Speaker,"these loudspeakers are very good working only for voice because they are not very resistant when subwoofer, but you have a system of divided sound contribute an excellent operation."
1,5 way nonsense,"5 way speakers are garbage, don't waste your time on them. They're just selling watts which does not mean quality of sound. Go with a more expensive 2-way speaker and you'll be good, although you won't get the name Chaos on the speaker, but whatever, get Boston Acoustics or Infinity. These speakers suck."
2,Sizing issue,"I was given one of these rings as a gift, it was beautiful, unfortunately it did not fit. The ring was ordered in a size 15 (yes I'm a big guy) and I do wear a size 15 but what came was not even close to a 15, it may be a 14 but it'd be tight even for that. The ring is not suitable for a pinky ring so I just stuck it in a drawer. I wish it had fit because I loved the appearance of it."
1,"Crude, Shallow, Neolithic","For those who find fifth-grade reading material a little challenging, this story might be fine. The plot is wrapped up just fine, but the banter is devoid of depth. If you like shallow figures and crude language, combined with dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics, read this. If you are more drawn to quality, leave this book alone."
3,Half a Double Play,"Robert Parker's creative, fictionalized approach to the problems Jackie Robinson faced when integrating baseball makes for fascinating reading. But the other half of his double play, the personalized reminisces of ""Bobby,"" alias him, growing up and loving girls and baseball, is basically self-agrandizement; the interesting historical observations -- and there are some --could be told within the story in Parker's as-always brilliant narrative. The Robinson character is not quite fleshed out (although it is in no way Hawk while the hero, Burke, is much like Spenser, Parker's long-running detective). No, the details in the story didn't happen but they might have. And the danger and tension surrounding Robinson were very real.You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this -- but you will lose little skipping the ""Bobby"" chapters."
5,An Excellent Love Story,"I just finished reading this for about the 3rd time or so, each time coming away with a different perspective. George's lifetime devotion to Gracie is very moving and you can't help but smile when you think of the 2 of them up there making everyone laugh. I recently picked the book up again at an infamous bargain book store, my original copy I'd lent out years ago & it was never returned. One of the best showbiz books in print, and one of the funniest books you'll ever read. There'll never be anyone like George & Gracie, not in this lifetime. Highly recommended."
4,"Very Good, yet space for improvement","I really enjoyed the vast majority of the contents of this game. The graphics were relatively good and the realism levels were high. This is quite a light adventure and role playing game and the thing I love about it is that you get to explore the castle, the groungs etc. at your own pace. I do not recommend this to very experienced gamers, unless you are huge Harry Potter fans (you will probably find it too easy, even easier than the first Harry Potter game). Best bit of it all is that it stays with the book's plot, without necessarily making the game boring. So, if you're bored during the summer, not knowing where to go or what to do, I say BUY THIS GAME FOR A GOOD TIME!!!!!!!!! Trust me, you will like it..."
3,harry potter,I just received this and played it. It has very clunky graphics and slow movements. It takes a long time to play because it moves so slowly. The good news is that there are a lot of things to find and do in the game. I would have thought that the programers would have worked out the kinks by now. Too bad they didn't snag a Disney designer to help program it!
4,Bluegrass Fakebook,"This is a great book, full of classics that are written easily to play and understand incluing the lyrics!"
2,Not Very Accurate,"I was disappointed in this ""Fake Book"". I was excited to see that the authors cited some original (more or less) recordings of the music. However, I was disappointed that the written chords and melodies did not always match the recorded music or what is often played by bands. For instance, Darling Corey has a classic, signature, beginning where the first phrase (wake-up) starts off low and ends on a higher note. In this transcription, the first phrase is the highest notes in the song."
2,"Horribly Inaccurate Description/Representation -- Polyester (Not Cotton), Buttoned Pockets (not Velcro)","Just got my shorts, look nice from all accounts. However , on further inspection, the material felt cheap and I discovered that these described 100% cotton shorts are 100% POLYESTER. I'd never buy polyester shorts as they're not comfortable. This was after I discovered that the shorts, depicted with velcro pockets and even described as so, had buttoned pockets. Beyond the cotton material, the primary reason I purchased these shorts was becasue I'm pretty active and like the security/durability the Velcro pockets give over buttoned pockets.If you can live with buttoned pockets and polyester material, go ahead and buy this. But be warned that the description (and item description)is NOT the merchandise Amazon is shipping to customers."
3,good read before a trip to vegas,"forget the stupid videos that play all day long in your hotel room, for less than youll lose in one session of slots, you can get a little more in depth info on all the major casino games, from rules to basic strategies. theres a pretty big section devoted to blackjack and craps, both pretty basic info, and the blackjack info is repeated almost verbatim in one of avery's other books. but for 15 bucks, itll get you a lot more prepared for a trip to the casino."
3,Good follow-up,"This continuing saga/series of detective Sano Ichiro is as expected if you have read any of the previous novels of Laura Joh Rowland. Decent read and plot line, interesting historical and period details but swallow and stereotypical characters.This plot ties to a previous story but it may be read individually without missing anything. It lacks the originality of the previous books and the depth of the adversary between Sano and the the Prime minister but it is an interesting crime story that flows well.If you are a fun of the series you will enjoy it. If you have not read any of her novels before, read it provided that you enjoy historical novels"
5,An excellent approach,"I've been tutoring a Thai woman in English, and when I discovered this book, our ability to communicate accelerated dramatically. There are so many things that are easier to explain when you have illustrations available to refer to, and having the words translated into Thai is even more helpful. It's a definite improvement over drawing (which I am not good at) and using the electronic pocket dictionary. The lesson went much more smoothly and my student bought the book for her own reference.My local librarian recommended this, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is learning English or teaching it to a Thai student."
4,Graphic Insights,"This was absolutely an amazing book, having the opportunity to view the internal designs of those war machines of my parents generation. This was a great purchase."
2,Not as strong as advertised,"First the good: It smells good and is non-toxic.Other then that, it really doesn't perform as implied in the description. It really doesn't cut grease and oil, nor harder stains on surfaces. I don't have time to get into details, but Simple Green Works better, as well as 409 and fantastic."
5,awesome,I bought this with a gift certificate and brought it into work - a local groom shop. It is absolutely awesome!! Everyone there used it and everyone ordered their own the next day! A definite must for anyone brushing dogs with an undercoat.
3,Good fun but WAY too short..,"Nice missions, good gameplay, but MUCH too short. I completed the three missions in about 3 hours of playing. Not good value for 20"
2,Too Little Too Fast,"Spearhead was rushed out too fast and not enough good stuff was put in. MOHAA was the best FPS out there, but the greedy guys over @ EA Games messed it all up w/this expansion pack. Gameplay is REALLY short, and multiplayer gets a B becausethe Tug Of War maps were cool. New guns really didn't make a difference in gameplay, and could have been put out in a patch. Graphics definitely went down, and you never even get to use the American weapons except for the first level. If you liked MOHAA, buy it, but buy it REALLY cheap."
5,Fantastic,Real good illustrations and directions. Have created a beautiful wall hanging using this book as a guide. Very happy with my purchase
3,thank you,"I liked the book, the only thing that was disappointing is that all the inside pages were in blk and white. When you showcase only color cover"
3,must be set in stone,"The only way this double rack won't fall off the wall with heavy bath towels in a very short time is if it is mounted on studs or blocking. Don't rely on any anchors no matter how big. Really big molly bolts may work (2"" spread if you drill the holes in the mounts.but I chose to block after moderate mollys pulled out leaving large holes in the sheetrock; cause of time and headache. Nice finish-cheap design"
5,"Happy Dogs, Happy Owner.","I have a Husky and a Golden/Chow mix. They have a ridiculous amount of constantly shedding undercoat that threatens my black wardrobe. I have used all sorts of products in the past, but this one is the only one that is not only effective, but my dogs actually love getting groomed with. Not only that, it is well made with stainless steel, and it works wonders. I am able to use it inside and the removed hair is manageable. Well done Oster."
5,Best Grooming Brush I've Used,"So far I'm thrilled with this product. We use it for our German Shepherd. Excellent for getting loose undercoat. I've previously used the ""U"" shaped shedding blades. Comparatively this oster product is much better. It's much more gentle and sturdy that those shedding blades. I've broken 2 or 3 of those shedding blades with regular use. I can't imagine breaking this one. Very sturdy and excellent at getting the hair off."
5,Usefull Product,"My Airedale terrier is happier after this Rake, i got a full bag of undercoat with no pain. material is full metal so i hope will last some years."
4,Worked on dog,"I bought this tool to use on a golden retriever and it worked very well. I also tried it on my cat who has fur that gets very matted. It didn't work as well on the cat, but did a great job on my long-haired dog."
2,I didn't realize it would cut the fur,"When I bought this I thought that it was going to somehow ""rake"" out the undercoat while leaving the topcoat in tact. Well, the tines of this comb have razors that actually cut the fur as I run it over my dogs coat. I didn't want to cut her fur, I just wanted a brush that would help release the fur underneath to help prevent shedding.This just wasn't what I expected."
4,Great but . . shipping . .,"I also bought this flour based on a recomendation from the book Gluten Free Baking Basics, which i bought from this site (and love!). It is true that this rice flour is the best quality rice flour I've used yet - however, for me the shipping cost as much as the flour, which i found hard to live with. You can get white rice flour at an asian market, much cheaper, and also a fine ground. However, the texture when using the asian white rice flour is a bit gummier - this brown rice flour has a much better texture. I'm only rating at 4 stars due to the craziness of having to ship flour."
3,Just Another Clip (into your CD player),"While this album is above average, and is worth a listen, it doesn't bring any innovation to the table. Besides the single ""Gotta Get Mine"", there are no songs that will make you really turn up your speakers and take notice. The best songs are Gotta get mine, Tight, and Comin' Real Again, the latter with writing by The D.O.C."
1,"A NoNo @ the beaches of Punta Cana - without ""corazon""","Many people might know Perico Ripiao bands from their latest visit at Dominican bars or vacational resorts. Not this one, for shure!!I bought this CD by mistake and would like to get rid of the heartless modern production immediately."
5,A Lucia comme il faut...,"Donizetti and Bellini's, uncut, operas run about as long as Wagner's - and approximate the same heft. If you love this opera, get this dvd; study it, live with it. If you're into singers showing off, then get one of the others - you'll save a lot of time but of course you'll be missing the Donizetti boat.I already revered La Scala but this production really blew me away - and I could compare the feeling of being in the tradition only by remembering performances of Swan Lake at the Maryinski. Even the productions featuring Mme (...)(at whose shrine I daily bow) seem a bit silly in relation to this one, full blooded and complete."
2,"Not suitable for super active dogs, like Whippets.","My 33 lbs. Whippet is very active, especially at coursing and racing events. After some slight pulling, which lunge buster holds ok, he pulled again with all his weight, and lunge buster fails. The inner elastic rope thorn apart from metal ring to which it was connected. Since outer coating is solid, it was required to make the opening in it, to pull elastic rope and connect it again to ring (pliers needed).So if you own a dog with great pull ability, this is not your product. Or prepare for some DIY-stuff"
5,Great help for a newbie to AJAX!,"I had been developing websites and web applications in ASP, VBA, PHP, JavaScript and HTML. I was getting pretty good at it. But, I had no way of grabbing refreshed data from the server and presenting it on the client side without rewriting everything on the client. Then, along came AJAX for Dummies ... just what I needed!I also bought the companion, Teach Yourself AJAX in 10 Minutes. By working through the simple examples, I developed an understanding of AJAX and how to apply it. Now, I can grab data from mySQL, msAccess or other data stores and update just the significant portion of the client page.The book gave me the basic concepts and understanding. The creativity to apply it was in my hands. Great purchase!"
3,"good shampoo, but lifeless over timer","I have oily hair. I bought this shampoo because my local store was out of Nioxin #2 (for oily hair), so I purchased it on the recommendation of the clerk. Although this is a good shampoo, over time it seems to build up and my hair has become thin and lifeless (I have about used up all of a 20oz bottle). Also, my scalp seems to be more itchy than it was several months ago. It has been an OK inexpensive shampoo, but I'm going back to Nioxin.Scott"
3,"Solid second entry from MC Breed of Flint, MI","""20 Below"" was the second album from MC Breed. He was coming off the success of his first single ""Ain't No Future in Your Frontin'"" and the first LP ""MC Breed & the DFC."" The album is produced in its entirety by his DJ, Flash-Technology. Samples are 70's-funk-and-electro heavy, he comes across like a midwest version of EPMD or a less sarcastic Redman. The lead off single (radio version) ""I ain't to be Flexed With"" is like ""Ain't No Future"" part 2, but it still works as a funky, bouncable jam. Other standout cuts include ""Ain't Too much worried"", ""jealous pimp"", ""Flash's Groove""(remember hip-hop instrumentals?) ""Little Child Runnin' Wild"" and ""Shout outs""."
1,I'm disappointed...,"I was very excited to see this novel had a five start rating when I purchased it. What a let down. The lead character's neurotic nature is exhausting to tolerate throughout the 200+ pages. The ending is so weak and clumsy, it is a MAJOR let down. Spare yourself this book."
5,Medictag Digital USB,"I like it! It will keep me safe, especially if/when I have an emergency. I am asthmatic and deaf. So if I begin to loose it, the Medictag will be there for staff to read."
5,Frodo Action Figure,"This is obviously the best Frodo action figure there is, as the only ""okay"" one before was the original FOTR frodo, with a week backround changing scene piece. While the light up sting may be abit big, it is a cool feature. However, the sword is only lit when the arm is moved up by the button. However after twisting it in a few ways, yo can have him stand with his arm down and the light on. His cape is a tad bit too heay but if you bend his knees he will stand in a cool cool pose. If you cant figure that out, use the cape to help balance him. Overall with a great sculpt this is a great figure."
5,A Great Frodo Figure,"Out of all my hobbits, (TT Merry and Pippin and the Frodo and Sam that came with the boat), this one is my favorite. Aside from the fact that his eyes could be a *little* bigger, he definitely looks like Elijah Wood, and light-up Sting is a nice touch. The fact that Sting can't be removed from Frodo's hand doesn't bother me in the least anymore, since I realized that I never remove the swords from any of my figures' hands anyway--if anything, it's frustrating when they fall out or refuse to let me position them correctly. My advice to anyone buying this Frodo would be to take him out of the box before judging him. His position in the packaging is odd-looking, but once his feet are fixed and his cloak attached, he looks great! Also, he *will* stand if his feet are positioned very carefully--try turning them out a bit. In the end, it will be evident that this is one of the best Frodos out there."
3,Doesn't always work,"I bought several for our department to use on a particular software program. The older Targus version (no 2 port hub) worked. This newer version (along with the wireless version) works, except for the ""Enter"" key which is crucial to the main function these keypads were purchased for. So essentially they're useless for me. Another problem is that all the local office and computer supply stores only have the Targus units, if any at all. Apparently not a big demand for them.I found some really cheap (in cost and construction) keypads at Big Lots that work perfectly, but they no longer carry numeric keypads.The Targus units work perfectly fine on other programs that I tested it with. Just not for the program I bought them for. The software company couldn't help me. Very frustrating."
3,"Nice, but doesn't work with iBook G4 & Tiger","High quality gadget that could be better if it had a 'clear' key along with the backspace (bs) and if the '000' was '00', but that last part is more of personal preference. Unfortunately this device does not work with an iBook G4 running Tiger. Don't even try."
4,Expected and Unexpected,"As expected, it's exactly what is described. It's small and sleek. It does have the dual USB ports which I don't really use as I have a wireless mouse for my lappy. As for the unexpected part of this review, I wasn't expecting the extra keys, making it unlike the keypad on my desk top keyboard. I don't really use them, but just in case you didn't notice them in the photo (like I didn't notice them) here is what they extra keys are: there is a key that splits the normally big ""0"" key into a ""0"" key (left) and a ""000"" key (right), and a ""BS"" key in the corner where I usually expect to find the ""-"" key. I suppose I'll get used to them."
5,Works with Mac and what is BS key,"I just picked this little pearl up onsale for $10 bucks at Staples. Package and info indicated WIndows only but it is working great on my MacBook Pro. Note sure if trouble is coming???? I enter tons of numbers and this is a delight.I see someone mentioned the BS key but I cannot figure out waht it does nor can I figure the ""Ins"" key. looked all over Targus site and cannot find anythingEdit -- OK color me stooooopid!!!!!!! BS I now understand. Still don't know what Ins is.Thanks."
4,A very good keypad,"Although the 2 USB port hub are V1.1 the keypad is an excellent accesorie, the keyboard is smooth with a very good presentation. Is the best buy for people with not much tecnical requirements"
1,I wasted my money on this book,"With great anticipation, I ordered this book, thinking that it would give real insight to the question, ""So, where'd you go to high school?"" I was born and raised in STL, and moved away 30+ years ago. Because of my husband's job, we moved around a lot, but I'd always meet someone from STL and, of course, one of the first questions was ""So, where'd you go to high school?""Depending upon the answer, one could ascertain the neighborhood that person lived in, a general idea of the family's income, the activities they might have taken part in, etc. Not being a social anthropologist, I hoped that this book would, once and for all, give some real insight into that provocative question. This book did not.What it is a compendium of origins of the high schools in St. Louis. It's history, more than anything. Will I be putting it up for sale? Most definitely."
5,This DVD will keep you laughing!,This show made me laugh so hard and kept me laughing every time I thought about what he said. He knows how to bring you comedy and make you think all at the same time. I can see myself in this DVD and you will too. Everyone will love the inspiring stand up comedian. He tells it like it is and doesn't hold back. George is at his best on this and be prepared to take a journey on his originality of comedy. The guest in the beginning will get you started on some really great laughs! Bravo George!
2,cleanser,I look after someone who is incontinent. Although this product works effectively the strength of it give the person diaper rash.
1,Bad Transfer,The movie is one of those late forties comedies Ealing is noted for. When a WWII bomb is exploded a treasure chamber is revealed containing a deed stating Pimlico was ceeded to the Duke of Burgundy and is therefore foreign soil. The inhabitants quickly realize that they do not have to follow post WWII British rationing and England responds by blockading the border but everything is resolved to everyone's satisfaction in the end.The reason I gave this only 1 star for a 3-4 star movie is because the transfer is very poor. I could have done better copying it from the TV.
1,Pricing,How can you claim this is $.82 per ounce when for 17 ounces the price is $39?? Math doesn't add up. Price should be $13.94 if it's $.82 per ounce
3,a learning curve,"I bought this item because I have Tasco binoculars and I like them, and I wanted to try binoc and camera combo.The binoc portion is pretty good but the camera is not so great.You kind of get the impression when you buy this that what you see thru the binocs is what your going to capture on the camera..not true..the camera has much less magnification and its hard to hold steady to get a good shot..I guess its not such a bad deal if you write it off as a learning curve."
2,TINY TABLE!!!,I bought this table last week for my three year old to use as a nightstand. After my husband out it together it was adorable and looking like it was very well made.....two days later the front board if the drawer fell off while my daughter was trying to pull it out !So.. We tried to fix it and thought we made it indestructible before we started to find pieces of chipped wood from the drawer. I guess my daughter pulling out the drawer cracked it !! Let me tell you she's not a rough kid so I'm not sure how this even happened! All I know is that it is a piece of you know what ! I didn't even bother returning it! I learned my lesson! DO NOT BUY CHEAP FURNITURE!The table is so tiny!! Even too small for a convertible crib bed !!!!!!!!!!!! So beware of this !Any it's very light so expect it to be moved around by your children!Hope this helped! I don't understand these five star reviews! I think they must have received these for free to review them! Otherwise they would tell the truth!
2,I should have read the reviews here before purchase,"I picked up this book while wandering through a bricks & mortar bookstore on sojourn with a hospitalized relative. I read lots of ""true crime"" but never before have I encountered such a one-sided unabashed apologia for the evil-doer (Danny Starrett.) The authors (the cover says they have previously won a Pulitzer prize - surely THAT book was less biased?) insinuated themselves into Danny's family - but the trade-off in their ""deal with the Devil's"" family is obvious. More balanced writers such as Ann Rule can take input from friends and family and give insight into the criminal mind and development, but in this case the unfortunate result is 400 pages of ""poor Danny and his Momma"" with short shrift for the victims, their families or loved ones."
4,Practical and easy to follow,"This book was my introduction to meditation. Patricia explains the many benefits of meditation - from reduced stress, improved immune systems, lower blood pressure and so on - and then gives some very clear and easy to follow instructions on how to meditate. She also devotes time to assist anybody who may have had difficulties with their meditation.My blood pressure has come down noticably since I got my insulin levels under control and started to meditate.I thought this kit was excellent and very practical."
1,wrong smell,"we returned this item as it was not as advertised, so I can't truly judge its quality, just that it was not what we thought we ordered."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This is a terrific mystery -- very fast paced plot, with incredibly vivid scenes and characters, and touches of humor that made me laugh out loud. Henry Polz reminds me of W.E.B. Griffin, writing -- this time -- about the gritty world of Chicago city corruption, alternative politics, and murder. I hope that, in Griffin style, Polz has many coming -- I can't wait to read the next one."
2,well.....,"The stories behind the songs? Not really. It's really a book about what a handful of musicians THOUGHT about Kiss songs. I have it. It is a must for Kiss fans. The interviews are pretty standard Kiss fare - nothing really new. But if you're like me - and you collect every 'slick' book published about the band, you sort of have to get it. Better options are available - ""Kiss: the Early Years"" and ""The Complete Touring History"""
5,Love this Granola,"Great tasting, I have eaten this granola every morning for a couple years now, it tastes like oatmeal cookies.Love it!!"
1,Garbage Quality - Avoid!,Bought this lock for my 2006 Silverado. Installed no problem but then the issues started. Internally in the lock there is a plasctic flap in the key hole which is very cheap. Was not long before you could not even install the key in the hole due to it sticking. After using some graphite dust I could then get the key in and make it work again. Now I can put the key in but the lock itself will not turn. So now I have a locked tailgate with a locked tonneau cover and no way to get into it. Unless you want to end up screwed like me I would avoid this lock and get something of better quality. Sure wish I did. Maybe after I drill it out and beat the heck out of it trying to get it off my truck I will return it for a refund.
2,It's homer,"Arrived all smashed and folded. Hot. Uncomfortable. Had to cut much larger holes in the eyes. Could see through the nose holes easier at first. Smells like plastic material. Homers eyes look stoned. Overall crappy, but essential if your going to be homer for halloween. I like stories."
1,Easy to use ... but you're on your own,"This product is much simpler to use than what is to be expected w/ Photoshop but the support for this product is virtually non-existent. I've had two problems (one w/ it seeing a newly added font) and after a half a dozen emails to their support group, I've been all but ignored and still have the problem ... effectively rendering the application useless. On to Photoshop I go ... at least there's millions of benevolent users that I can bounce the issues off of in a newsgroup."
2,"Decent movie, but nothing orginal.","I hate when movies start off by pretty much giving away the ending. If you are have a real good eye for movies you can alreayd pick out then ending by the actions in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Once that happened, I wasn't really interested. Edward Burnz just is so wooden to me and uninteresting. I just couldn't get behind his character. Rachel Weiz looked beautiful as always, but they really gave her nothing to do. Watching her seduce the VP of the Bank was a fun.This movie is real predictable. I watched it with a friend who never really into movies like I am, and she figured everything out from the first five minutes. Now that is bad.Dustin Hoffman was great in his role and he seemed to be having fun playing the big and bad. Should have been more scenes with him."
1,Truly awful,"The plot is both illogical and incredibly formulaic. It's like they strung a bunch of overused gangster movie cliches together. In general, the characters are all ""types"" of one kind or another. Irritating cardboard cutouts yapping cliches at each other.Dustin Hoffman has been in some great movies, but this is a low point. Although he is the only actor in the movie who at least attempts to be original. You can see that he's trying to bring something to his character, but he just seems to be trying too hard.If you want to watch a movie about con artists, try the brilliant House of Games, or The Grifters, which is excellent."
2,The con is...on you!,"I liked Ed Burns ""Sidewalks of NY"" more than this one. Yet Confidence is the kind of movie you'd watch on a boring sunday afternoon, when there's nothing good on TV. It wants to be smart, but doesn gets there. The writing is poor, and motivations of the main characters are weak. Would you run a scam operation from your own home? They use their place to do cons, thinking the guy will be too scared to come back!!!dusting Hoffman doesn't sell it as a mafioso, but with such bad writing, he did what he could. This one movie that should have never been done. With so many better con movies out there like Matchstickmen, Ocean's Eleven and the like, we didn't need Confidence. Christopher Walken's ""Scam"" with Lorraine Bracco (from the Sopranos) is a much enjoyable and better movie than this one. At least in Scam there's chemistry between the leads, and strong motivations for their actions."
3,"Wow, I didn't see that coming.","The bribe with Andy Garcia really did take. They were partnered with him. They set up the Dustin Hoffman character to be busted for drugs so they could take all the money. When the female character shoots Edward Burns, it is another fake shooting then they all get together and split the cash."
2,"Weak, weak and weaker; Hoffman's nadir","Wow did this suck. So many good people but such a lame-brained script and plodding direction.Plus, how the hell did Hoffman take this part? It's a stretch and he doesn't make it, in fact he seems almost self-parodistic at times. I love his work in general but this blows.This flick tries to be post-modern/gleaming hip and fails miserably.We watched most of it then gave up half an hour before the end; I rarely do that and I love a good crime/con flick (Double Indemnity! Matchstick Men!).Passola."
3,Another movie about Scam and cons,"It's like movies about scam and cons are good sellers these days.CONFIDENCE is one of them and even if it's not the best movie you will see, it's still a good entertainment.The actors are pretty good and the twist is finally well plaid.The plot is not very exciting and loses a bit of its importance.It's more as if you want to see what's next than what is all about.The story is quite flat and it could be really more exciting. Fact is I had the feeling the screenwriter was writing his script without knowing what he's writing about and improvising pages to pages.Not a great movie but Okay."
4,Power out alarm,"I bought this just to give me a simple alert that the power is out. It works great, but it does have some issues. I wish you could adjust the power out alert setting to one minute. The lowest you can set it to is 5 minutes, but its not a huge deal. All in all it works great."
3,Reliance freeze alarm/ power outage,"Not a bad product--performs somewhat as advertised. Not happy with vender. The battery supplied was dead!! When it is advertise as ""battery supplied"" I expect a good battery!By the way the batt cost $4.99."
3,so so,"sometimes the unit clicks, particularly when the volume of the song is very low, interrupting the flow. also, i had to return the first one since the right speaker wasn't working after the first day."
1,it doesn't work with the original ipod model,the title says it all but I had to make a call to the company in England to find this out. What a pain!
2,I returned this!!!,"I am surprised by the rave reviews this item received. I thought the sound was terrible. The $25 boombox I got from Walmart sounds 20 times better than this. I can't see paying $80 for something that has such poor sound quality. Maybe if you just want it to listen to once in a while at low volumes it would be okay. It is not a system for everyday listening.I also tried the JBL on stage, which is much much better--but still sounds a bit tinny. But if you are trying to keep the price down, I'd say spend the extra $20 or so dollars and get the JBL--JBL does not have a battery option, but it is a small system--not much bigger than the logic.I ended up purchasing the Altec Lansing im7, which is much better and totally worth the extra money. I also have the klipsch ifi, which is not portable but it blows all the other systems away if you don't need portable (and is only $200 at Costco.)"
2,I'm with the naysayers - these speakers are a waste of money,"I got these speakers because of the positive reviews. I chose not to read the negative ones. Unfortunately, the naysayers were right. These speakers look cool but are not good. The sound is tinny and weak and if the volume is turned up the unit starts to shake. I didn't spend extra money to buy cd-quality music so I can listen to it on these speakers that make the music sound like it is coming from a 10 times re-recorded casette. The unit is also not as small as the picture suggests because it is supported by a folding out stand in the back (sort of like a standing picture frame). Also, if your Ipod has a case, it has to be removed or Ipod will not fit in the dock. That problem can be solved by using the included dongle. Overall, the sound quality was so bad that I returned it."
3,It's Okay,"If you can afford something else, buy that. I had this for one week--and could not raise the volume on this to ""loud."" I wanted to hear this in the shower from my bedroom (not a far distance, you see) and the volume would not go up past ""medium."" Buy something else."
1,Non existant Tech Support,"The program is ok for basic work, which most require.There are some important limitations like customer data enty and restoring from back-up is a nightmare. Although they offer tech support, it is very expensive and the so called tecnicians are easily frustrated so you essentally are wasting your money![...]"
3,Good Idea for when u have room.,This product works ver well and dose what it is suppost to do. All one can ask for. Only problem is if u dont have room around your cig. lighter then there might be a problem. Not to movible and has limited space. I put it in my 4Runner and it works fine when I dont have to change tracks on a CD. It's kind of in the way but I like the product and it was a decent buy.
2,Wish it were bigger,"I bought this package primarily because I needed a bag for my brother to handcarry my newly online purchased Nikon D40x and some other accessories in the aircraft from L.A. to the Philippines for me. The battery that came with it made the purchase seem even better since I was going to get a spare anyway. I found out, though, that the bag was too small to carry all my stuff: my D40x with an 18-200 VR lens on it, an extra 10-20mm lens, a flash, a hood and a spare battery. I'd bring it along if I were to abbreviate my gear and carry just the basics. However, I purchased a bigger bag a week after this one arrived."
1,SORRY IT WAS IN STOCK,"IT WAS SHIPPED FAST, ALL PIECES WERE IN BOX, HOWEVER, SCREW HOLES WERE NOT DRILLED OUT RIGHT..TOO DEEP FOR THE NUMBERED SCREW. CALLED THE HELP LINE BECAUSE THE DIRECTIONS SUCK & THE HELP LINE ONLY SENDS MISSING PIECES..NO HELP THERE. WE WILL HAVE TO CUSTOMIZE THIS KIDCRAP...& HOPE IT DOESN'T FALL APART.GOOD LUCK IF YOU ORDERED THIS BED,EMMA"
4,my boy loves this!,"it seemed little late to buy toddler bed for 3 yr old boy but I thought I should buy one for him before it's too late so that he can have a good sleep and enjoy it at the same time. this is well made and affordable, easy to assemble.it was little too tight to put toddler sized mattress."
3,Cute bed - not the best manufactured,"Cute bed, my 2yr was saying, ""dada, i'm going to LOVE this bed..."" While he's still not sleeping in it because he prefers his crib, he does seem to adore it.The bed wasn't too bad to assemble - however, some of the parts were not manufactured correctly. For instance, the backside rail was not screwed into the wood and the holes were slightly too big for the screws. A little glue, clamps, and time solved that issue. The other issue I ran into is one of the threaded bolts was installed by the manufacture backwards. This was for the platform that the mattress goes on. I ended up screwing the bolt in from under the bed and then squirting a bunch of super glue into the hole where the bolt was showing (just barely).Purchased online from Amazon, but not from the Amazon store, rather direct from manufacturer."
4,Not What I Thought,"For some reason I had a different idea of what this book would be, but found it interesting and thought provoking nonetheless."
2,I Feel Like the Grinch!,"I'm about half way through this book, and so far, the best things about it are (a) the references to books written by other authors, and (b) the exercises at the end of the chapters. The actual content of the book is pretty lame. (Sorry! But that's how I feel.) It's not that grace doesn't exist or that we can't be more mindful of instances of grace in our lives...it's just that reading the blurb about the book gives you just as much info as reading the book itself. The author has stretched an article out into a book without adding any new info. I haven't gone to her website yet, but I bet you could get just as much info from her website as this book.Overall recommendation: Skip this one."
