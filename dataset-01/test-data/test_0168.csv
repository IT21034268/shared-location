2,"Not the worst, but surely not the best","Goldeneye is a film which needed a few things. First, Sean Bean was a terrible bad guy. His villian is about as menacing as Herve Villachaize. Second, originality. The enemy base being hidden under water is a copy of the base in You Only Live Twice. Third, a good Bond. Pierce Brosnan has the personality of that mule in Winnie The Pooh. He makes Dalton look downright cheerfull. One saving grace, Famke Jannsen, who makes the best henchman since Jaws. If you like Bond, watch real Bond movies. Watch From Russia With Love and see what made this series great. For the person who said Pierce Brosnan was the best Bond, you must like the acting talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt too."
4,GoldenEye,This movie is worth the price of admission just for the tank chase alone. Not your usual Bond movie as the females aren't evil supermodels and true a woman who crushes her prey to death with her thighs is a little campy but other than that this is one of the better takes on Ian Flemmings 007 character.
3,"GREAT PLOT, BAD ENDING",Dont get me wrong. I loved this movie. The only things i would have changed would be that Boris should not have died. & Alec Trevelyn (006) shouldnt have died and should have killed Bond and started his own series. NO ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT.
2,worst Brosnan Bond film ever!,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the Pierce Brosnan 007 movies. However, this was the worst 007 movie of his I've ever seen! The acting is not very good. The main villian, played by Famke Janssen, isn't a good villian. Although beautiful, she really doesn't do a good job of acting. The movie is also cut poorly. I lost the point of the story after the first hour! The effects and chase scenes are great though.In conclusion,I'd only advise watching it if it's on TV. It's not worth buying."
5,Bond movies,We love the Pierce Brosnan Bond. So we are collecting all the movies starting with these. The service was very quick and I got them in less than a week.
2,Best Bond since George Lazenby!,"I'm sorry but it takes more than a handsome guy and one great stunt to make a good Bond movie. Brosnan brings nothing to the role, no danger, no humor, no character; he's just a walking mannequin in a well-cut suit (why did Dalton leave the series to play Rhett Butler in a TV movie is beyond me). Not only that, the movie lacks a strong archvillain (Famke's fine), a strong soundtrack (the title song notwithstanding) and a strong finale. Both Joe Don Baker and the nerdy cyber whiz-kid are unsufferable burdens, and you never get to see what the car does!By the way, shouldn't Natalya Whats-her-name and the cybercretin Boris belong to the Russian military? Do you think the Soviet Army would entrust its most secret weapon to a couple of ordinary civilian hackers?"
3,fun,"This Bond movie has just one basic flaw but utterly irritating: why should non Anglo-Saxon characters (here most are Russian) speak English among themselvels when no Anglo-Saxon is present and with an awful accent at that?This is silly and irritating. Either you let them speak their language with subtitles or, if you think viewers will be annoyed by having to read, you let them speak plain English: otherwise one must think that non-natives alway speak in a language foreign to them just for the heck of producing guttural sounds.As for the rest it is one of the best bond movies I can recall: action packed, well scripted (not always a given with Bond movies), well acted (Brosnan is good) and interesting in its assumptions.Children are best kept out of it unless it is with a parent ready to do a lot of explaining."
4,bond is back i hope,i really enjoyed the storyline of the movie goldeneye--it was action packed from start to finish--pierce brosnan is a very 90/s james bond--he had very big shoes to fill and did a great job--the only thing i take issue with in this movie is the psychoanalysis of james bond and his dark side --forget the psychobabble --james bond is bigger and better than that--i want classic bond action and adventure--skip the freud--this was a good movie but pierce brosnan does an even better job in tomorrow never dies --he seemed much more at ease with the james bond character in that movie---
4,"Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan","The debut of Brosnan as James Bond is an actually interesting. The movie was great but the sound effects are a bit cheesy. Especially when Bond and Natalyia crash their plane. But it was an enjoyable Bond film. The song in the beginning by Tina Turner is the best Bond song ever!So buy this movie, buy the Nintendo 64 game, and kinda buy the soundtrack."
2,Extreme disappointment,"When I heard that Brosnan was finally taking over the Bond role, I had high hopes. Dalton was simply horrible as Bond and the franchise was in jeopardy. Alas, Brosnan is an extreme disappointment to say the least. He seems almost embarrassed in the role. When he utters the famous quote ""My name is Bond, James Bond"", he is barely audible and sounds like a complete wimp! He also needs to lighten up a touch. He tries to be as serious as Connery and, in doing so, is almost as boring as Connery himself. In conclusion, Goldeneye is a weak Bond entry that is highly forgettable. Brosnan clearly does not have the presence, wit and charm that Roger Moore had."
1,Horrible,Ordered a DVD that ended up right in the trash. After being in the DVD player for about 5 seconds in would freeze. I tried it multiple times but it kept doing the same thing. Never doing business with them again. It's pointless to make a return on an item that costs as much as the shipping.
3,A tragedy.,"The third book in The Technocrat War trilogy. This book was a flawless as the first two except for the end which crushed the book. I have no idea what happened here. The book was full of so much good dialogue, plot intrigue, well written paragraphs but in the last two chapters it was like a totally differant person was writing. It really did ruin the book for me. I don't know how to describe it... Maybe the most fantastic meal you've ever seen laying before you only to find that it's been attacked by flies and now it's crawling with maggots.I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. Damn you Austen Andrews! What were you thinking?"
3,somewhat useful...,"In my grad level Nursing Research class, this book was helpful. However, I am doing qualitative research for my master's project and this book was quite lacking in this area. I would suggest if you're doing qualitative, find a different book."
3,poorly organized,"I have used this text for class and find it to be poorly organized. Specifically, if you approach the chapters as ordered, students feel that the course sequence is redundant, yet because of the global and superficial approach, they still need additional work with basic concepts like measurement, validity, and others. Some of the ""middle of the book "" chapters seem more like enrichment materials, yet these are presented before core concepts are covered.In the future,I will go back to the tried and true Polit and Hunglar text."
4,Great read on slavery!,I really enjoyed this book and if you want to learn a little more about slavery back in the 1800's then you should read it too!This is a true book written from a former slave and it will open your eyes to what she and others went thru.I suggest this book to anyone who enjoys this genre!
5,Slavery,Great great great book written by a slave in early history. I will say every one should read it so they can feel what in early history slaves felt.
4,Very interesting reading,This book gives a look into the life of a slave-woman and her struggle for freedom for herself and her children. I would recommend this to a friend for sure!
3,I've Read this Already,I've read this years ago but wanted to have a copy on my Kindle to be right at hand. I will read it again but not right away. The story is a little puzzling - how can someone hide out in an antic for seven years?
2,Life of a Slave Girl,This book did not hold my interest. It was a book I could easily put down and walk away from.
4,A moost interesting account,"After having watched the movie ""The Help"" I saw this book listed & decided to read an actual account of a life in slavery. After readingof her experience & the reality of being property of someone else I have a much better understanding of the slavery issue. She writes with much discretion, not to make her story salacious, but to share her desire for freedom & what she was willing to suffer to gain for her children & herself what we take for granted. A very interesting & thought provoking read."
5,Incidents in the life of a slave girl,Such a well written book* I felt as I was there with her! It was a heart opener!!!! Bless the bravery that it took to share this with the world!!!
4,thanks,This was a good book and a great deal i will buy from seller again. thanks again for having it to me on time.
5,Excellent novel,"I read this for my class ""Roots of Feminism,"" viewing the novel through a feminist lens. First of all, it's a great novel that really captures the reader's attention and breaks your heart through the stories that are retold. Secondly, the publisher does a great job of explaining words and phrases that you might not be familiar with. There are even a list of themes at the end of the book. Definitely recommend!"
4,Truth about slavery,"I don't do well just picking up a book, reading it through and keeping interest throughout. This book was part of a history course and I have found it very interesting as well as informative. Growing up I always heard of how slaves were treated but when you actually read it from a ""SLAVES"" view, it brings a whole new perspective. I would recommend it for anyone."
4,An unbelievable story,"While reading this, I found it hard to believe it was an actual autobiography and checked a couple of times. It is amazing how anyone can survive this kind of abuse, and poverty and go on to write such an incredibly literate book. It is also shaming how badly slave owners behaved, and how some are still behaving--mostly but not only--in other parts of the world."
3,It is a interesting book,I enjoyed reading this book. It held my attention once I understood the characters and their roles. Sometimes though a little hard to believe that the author really was the writer.
5,Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,"incredible story, I felt honored to have been able to read what this woman wrote."
4,Unbelievable!,"Shocking to think people can be so inhumane....anything for selfishness, power and material gain. It's a good reminder to hold everyone's rights sacred."
4,GOOD QUALITY,"The quality of all four movies is good. I wasn't expecting much when I purchased this(primarliy for ""Horror Hotel""), but was really suprised. The images are mostly crisp. There's not much hiss. You could probably spend more and get better transfers, but you can't beat the price/quality ratio for this Platinum Disc Corp DVD."
4,A man's depressing struggle to fullfil the American Dream...,"Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesmen"" was a short but interesting play.. It portrayed a man, Willy Loman's struggle to live the american dream, but like many others was unsuccessful to fullfil it. Willy Loman is a dime a dozen, he strives to bring happiness to himself and his family, but does not succeed, for he is the working man in america. His son Biff is walking in his footsteps and in my opinion will have the same life his father had, and the same ending. Even tho this book dragged at times, stay with it. You will be rewared with a very dramatic and emotional conclusion. I recommend this play to people of all ages, so they can understand how hard and sorrowful life can be."
5,"Farscape - season 1, collection 2",Love this scifi series - wish it was still a regular series. Order was processed on time and package was such that it arrived undamaged.
5,just received this burner,"i recently received this burner, aside from the quick order process, havingjust installed this optimum drive which i modified it externally enclosedinside a (Plumax/AMC 525C2-PTS Silver Combo USB 2.0 & Firewire 1394 (Oxford 911+) External Enclosure),overall installation, test drived, executed smoothly, with no problems at all. I would highly recommend this to anyoneconsidering on an upgrade, replacement, or in my case, an additional drive.My Older burner which is the (Pioneer DVR-106D)still up & runnin' since '03has not dissapointed me yet, which is why i'm convince of the outstandingreliability pioneer burners possess. oh by the way thank's Amazon.com forthe speedy order, i'm amazed....keep up the good work! ""Aloha"""
5,Worth the money,This book is worth the money and I plan to recommend it to anyone who might need to guidance this book offers. Love it.
5,Lots of colors to choose from.,Arrived on time. Nicely made. Easy to use. My niece is almost 4 and she loves to paint with these.
5,Great Item!,I bought these water colors to go along with a paint book that I got for my daughter so that she would have some more colors to choose from. She really enjoys all the different colors and the paint washes out very easily as advertised. My daughter is 3 and this along with a coloring book can keep her occupied for quite some time.
4,Great Selection of Most Used Praise Songs!,This CD had all of the most requested praise songs. The instrumentals were easy to sing along with and were very spiritual in nature. I would recommend this CD for anyone needing instrumental background music.
3,Alternately campy & powerful: these punks really are savages,"It's tough to get a fix on this movie: it's a boisterous, R-rated camp-fest one minute(featuring a group of kids, including Linda Blair, who look far too old to still be in high school)and an unabashedly brutal trash-flick the next. It has more spirit and drive than Linda's ""Chained Heat"", and the kids' inter-relationships and tough talks with the school principal are cynically amusing, but the much-discussed rape scene is extremely nasty, as is the sequence with the girl on the bridge. Suddenly these hot-shot punks become murderous, psychotic thugs--yet the tone of the picture never changes. The images are very disturbing, the violence bordering on realistic, but the director keeps it all hopping mad--like a nihilistic cartoon. B-"
3,meet Danny Steinmann,"[good things]It was a great revenge flick, with a great performance by Linda Blair. Linnea Quigley had a supporting non-speaking role that she did an awesome job with, plus she was absolutely adorable in this movie. It was a typical 80's movie, and since it was done by an ex-porn director (Steinmann) it had that element as well, alot of gratuitus nudity and bush shots.[the bad]The movie seemed to a bit too sleazy, turning it into more of a softcore movie than anything else. Could have used more blood.[final thoughts]I think this movie was more an exploitation film than anything else. There was a bit too much nudity, it seemed like scenarios were invented just to fit nudity in the mix (i.e. the fight in the shower). I still like this movie alot though, Linda Blair and Linnea Quigley do an excellent job despite the lack-lustre directing and screen writing. There are about a handful of scenes where you can see the boom-mic come down int he shot-- oops."
2,Shut Up Miss Julia,"The title of this book is wonderful and I had high hopes, but, it was a great disappointment. I understand it is a book of fiction, but it was in no way believable. For all those years, Miss Julia was the faithful, naive wife and suddendly she becomes a ""tiger"" on the death of her lying and tiresome husband... just can not buy the story. A fellow librarian and I ageed that Miss Julia should keep her mouth shut...her IQ was in the single digits. Too bad it was not a good book... I did read all of it, but do not suggest it to other readers."
4,Miss Julia Speaks her mind,"keeps you wondering about Miss Julia, but she seems to know what she is after in life"
1,Not a character worth caring about,"A recent widow discovers her late husband had an illegitimate son.I've tried to read this before, with no more success than now. When the characters in a character-based book are one-dimensional and unlikable, there just isn't anything to keep me reading."
5,This is THE book for your little ones AND their loved ones!,"As a board member for a food-allergy support organization, I review books relating to food allergies every month.This is my favorite for young children like my son. There are others out there that provide too much information or are a little too scary for the pre-school and toddler set.This book is appropriate for even the youngest child, and it lets them know what they can do with their caregivers to stay safe.If you have a young child with a food-allergy, and can only buy one book, pick this one.If you're lucky enough to have a few, this one will be a warm and welcome addition to your collection!"
3,I had to have this book for my class,"The book is well worn. I would say I paid a little too much but then again, it is not something that will be on my coffee table. The young man I bought it from enclosed a very nice note, which I considered very thoughtful. Maybe I will sell it for $20."
4,"Concise,rich,warm","This CD is a beauty. It's not quite the timeless classic that It's Too Late is... nor is it the sprawling (and hence, expensive) collection of live tunes that Night in San Francisco is. The Opera House show has certain concise, yet rich feel. It has been a favorite of mine for years and I highly recomend it!"
3,The heartbreak specialist,"Arthur Alexander's LONELY JUST LIKE ME delivers about a half-dozen strong numbers. Alexander at his best rivals Roy Orbison, the Everly Brothers, and probably any other heartbreak specialist of whom you can think. For example, listen to ""If It's Really Got To Be This Way"" or ""All The Time,"" great songs, but the medium (Alexander's singing) is the message, I am not kidding. The Lord called Arthur Alexander home shortly after the 1993 release of LONELY JUST LIKE ME. Hear this album now, or it's your loss."
5,Great Present!,"I bought this for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. He is at beginner level for working out, but is using this to increase his effort. He calls me regularly to tell me how much he loves this watch."
5,Has useful features over the Polar FS1,"""Heart Link"" is a feature in the FS3 that allows for buttonless operation of backlight and display-change by momentarily holding watch unit near chest strap. As I run mostly at night, I'm glad I spent the extra $20 over the Polar FS1 to get this feature.The watch unit is stylish enough to wear every day. My 52 year old eyes love the LARGE digits. Display is not at all cheesy, and looks a bit euro in motif.Note that I have rather large wrists. The watch strap just barely fit me using the last notch!Monitor works like a charm. Accurate and easy-to-use. Try buying at ""How to be Fit-dot-com"" I received the monitor, shipped free from NM to NY in 1 day. Excellent service with highly recommended product."
4,Very accurate & couple nice features,"I wanted a simple monitor that was really accurate. The FS3 is a really good one. My favorite features are the large display and the ""buttonless"" function (holding the watch close to your chest rotates the mode of the display from heart rate to chrono to time of day).Two things I would change... I would show both the chrono and the heart rate at the same time (addressed somewhat by my ""likes""), and I would use a lighter grade plastic for the watch/wrist material. The plastic wrist band is SO thick, it's difficult to thread in/out of the buckle."
3,"Ride Hard, Ride Smart: Ultimate Street Strategies for Advanced Motorcyclists","I bought this book looking for specific techniques that I could practice to improve my street-riding skills. ALthough there is some of that kind of information, safety is the main message of this book. If you have a kid who is a hotshot on their new bike, reading this will humble them. It did me. I have slowed down considerably."
2,Good Advise Hard Read,"Pat Hahn, has some great advise in this book and I learned a lot from it. However, it is probably the most painfully dull read I have read in years. For every two pages of hard to read material you get about one or two sentences of true gems.I felt like I was back in coledge reading boring books to try and get the few good items out of them before the test.The same matereial could have been covered in about 20 pages."
5,A MUST READ,"Whether you're thinking about getting a motorcycle, just got one or have been riding for 30 years, this book is a MUST read - period! Great-to-know information and common sense make reading this book worth getting a bike (if you don't already have one) and riding."
2,"Many ideas, perhaps too many","CAVEAT: I read this as the book selection from a discussion group, so I read it more critically than I would have something I chose on my own.It starts out promising. Two male, homosexual, vegan protagonists, interstellar civilization, hyper-environmentalism, matriarchal civilization clashes with patriarchal one, nanotechnology. Lots of action, some sex, and interesting ideas about having pets. I could mention more, but that would spoil the plot.However, there were too many implausible things about the matriarchal society and nanotechnology. If nanotechonology were replaced by magic, it would have not have affected the story. When I read SF, I can accept one or two items where I know I should suspend disbelief. This novel had too many.My main complaint was the writing. I was not sucked into the world as I am in most good novels. There were too many things that jarred me out, making me aware that the writer messed up."
2,Borrow it don't buy it,"Early in the 1980's team owner Gene Autry discovered that 9 superstar baseball players do not necessarily make a great baseball team. The 13 superstar authors who contribute to this book do not achieve much better results. The plot is disjointed, writers miss cues from one chapter to the next, the pace shifts from low to high (and vice-verse) way too often. I found myself wishing that Hiassen, Leonard or one of the other superstar authors who contributed to this mish-mash would have taken the story and made a complete book out of it rather than the small but sometimes good contributions they did make. Not an entirely bad read, but certainly not worth the money needed to purchase it. Borrow it from a friend or visit the library instead."
1,Thumbs Down,"If ""Naked Came the Manatee"" had been submitted for publication, authored by unknown writers rather than the Florida luminaries such as Hiaasen, Leonard, et al., it would have been rejected."
4,Like a party game that got out of hand,"I like this idea. It amuses me greatly. It amuses me that Dave Barry got to start, and he named a manatee Booger, and then a whole bunch of other Floridian authors kept laying traps for each other. The best trap by far comes in chapter 3, Paul Levine's chapter. Until then, you think the book is just silly, and then you read his surprise, what he left for Edna Buchanan to get out from under, and things leave ""silly"" and start to turn seriously WACKY."
1,"Don't buy it, don't even get it at the library!","First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book, each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of ""telephone.""You know ""telephone"" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts."
1,Naked Came the Manatee - Never Came the Enjoyment,"Don't spend your money on this disjointed waste of time. There are too many characters with too little description to make them memorable. I found myself constantly flipping back trying to keep track of who was doing what to whom. As a native South Floridian, I think the book is a very sickening and unfair protrayal of the area. I plan to shred my copy and recycle the pages."
3,good album/bad cover,this album was ok... not the best for ryan adams. all the songs sounded the same. his cover of wonderwall was just plain awfull...
4,his finest hour,"I am listening to this EP as I type and realizing how gorgeous it is, falling more and more in love with it. Can't wait to get EP #2. It has the emotional truth of heartbreaker but with denser, more mysterious atmosphere. Ryan at his most searing, vulnerable and mature. I'm not sure why Lost Highway didn't like this one...while it's darker than Rock and Roll which I'm still having trouble getting into all the way through, there are some very catchy tunes, i.e. world war 24, love is hell and avalanche. the instrumental touches (which Ryan in an interview said were too slick or perfect for his tastes) I find tasteful and stirring. Ryan Adams will always be the first contemp. male singer/songwriter I truly loved and who triggered my obsession with all things boy singer/songwriters (there certainly is a talented mass of them right now!!) I love whatever he does."
1,Ripped out of the package,"I bought these in several different colors but I shouldn't have because these stockings are so thin that the color was barely visible. In addition, they all developed a run right out the package. Maybe my thighs are thick though because I found that they held up on their own."
2,would not recommend,i got these for my girlfriend and she was shocked to find out that as soon as she open them up the stockings were ripped
3,Bargain Stockings,These were a fair pair of stockings for the price. They are not quite as sheer as I had hoped but they fit OK and look OK. I have these in 2 shades black and natural. I am not sure I would buy more but I will wear the ones I have.
2,Nylons,"The material is not great quality, very thin and do not feel like nylons. Pay a little more for better tigh highs"
3,enjoyable but predictable,"I enjoyed this book for the most part, but it certainly isn't a book that I would go raving about to all of my friends to read, mostly because of its predictablity. I won't say the ending, but I figured it out pretty early into the book. Read this if your looking for something easy and a little suspenseful. Find something else if you're looking for a really thrilling suspenseful book."
1,Perennial Losers,Only the Red Sox would make a movie about yet another season that ended without a World Championship. or an American League Championship. or a Division Championship.
5,Terrific dog brush!,I got this brush for our German Shepherd. First time my son's bed and carpet haven't been knee-deep in dog hair. What can I say? Buy it! The dog loves it! I probably will even need fewer vacuum cleaner bags from now on!
4,Great Flea Comb,"Works very well and it doesn't scratch the skin like some others. I have two cats with very fine long hair this comb is the best I have used for them. I also have two Boxers it works well on their short hair too. Very good product, be sure to keep a wet paper towel with some liquid soap to clean off the comb and kill the fleas immediately."
1,flea comb,It's hard to find enough words to cover this product success or not. It arrived promptly and is very well made but not for too many dogs. The two rows of teeth would tear fur out on some dogs. I didn't think it thru properly but I can see that it just isn't right for any dog with a wiry coat or thick deep fur. Not that is isn't a well made product but it's just not going to work for me.
5,super!,"this thing works great! i caught over 100 fleas off our cats, shortly after i gave them some Nitenpyram and that solved the entire problem. I used the comb after the Nitenpyram too, to check for fleas and i couldn't find any. I would buy again!"
3,Fairly Good,"This comb is quite small for those of us who are equipped with fairly large hands. Perhaps the folks who manufactured this comb in Thailand, a spelling variation for China, have smaller hands for which this comb would be a better fit. I have a Doberman who is large as well. It is quite a chore with this small comb to give him complete coverage. To be fair, I am rating this comb only as it applies to me. If you have a small or medium sized hand and a fairly small pet you would probably give this comb a higher rating. I have no problem with the performance of the comb only with the size."
4,Great Flea Catcher!!,"I just placed another order for 2 more of these flea combs. It does work great, but the teeth in the comb eventually fall out one by one over time. I still feel it does the job and will continue to use it! Like I said, over time and many uses, the teeth do tend to fall out, but hey, consider the price of this little gadget!!! It works!! Also, our Pugs don't mind us using the comb on them and that is very important to us!! It is worth the bargain!!"
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this with the basic and was so disappointed with the basic, I never opened the intermediate. It is basically an upgrade (to CD's) the ""Listen to me pronounce the words"" system commonly available on cassette tapes 20 years ago. Mine is still unopened, so I'll probably put it on Amazon soon. I'll be traveling to Italy this summer using my phrase book again!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I thought I would be able to learn Italian while driving in my car. However, you need to follow the Course Book while listening to the CD. It defeated my purpose of learning while driving. I gave it two stars because I could still learn some of the language without the book, but I'm going to return it anyway."
3,Let me tell you something about David Lynch,"I am not always into the intricacies of the cinema, yet David Lynch provides for an explanation as to why. I loved ""Blue Velvet"" ( a lot), but the nightmares and dreams, well not so much. But don't use me as a gauge for assessing the cinematic value of anything. I'm not qualified and, in some cases unable to do so. The book is good if you need to delve into Lynch's cinematic style and the mind behind the lens."
3,Not Jewish Enough (and I admire the Author),"To have a least bit understanding of Hermetic Quabbalah the aspirant must be mature and have some rudimentary understanding of the Hebrew language. Far better source for indepth learning of this isThe Key to the True Kabbalahand follow up reading of Rawn Clark (much is free on his website) but I would read his new book on the GRA tree that is coming out (hopefully soon)Eight Temples Meditation ProjectYou see, the ""western tradition"" LOVES to borrow from the old, eastern ways BUT makes detrimental shortcuts and simplifies things to the eventual diminishing value of the original.Rawn as his Quabalistic approach have been attacked not being Jewish enough by the Jewish Cabbalists and being too Jewish by the Golden Dawn/Dion crowd. I say he is right on the target for me...."
2,wordy and expensive,"you can get a free pdf online without much computer effort at all, as well as i agree very tangental but shed some insight on a topic i was moderatley to minimally versed in at the time, try joining a discussion group online one exists on a spirituality forum i frequent"
5,As it says on the package,"For anyone curious about Shakuhachi music, this is a great place to start. Traditionally this is a contemplative music, played alone or with a very small audience, hence it is devoid of crowd pleasing flourishes, allowing the listener to focus in on tiny subtleties. The first couple of tracks feature a longer and deeper sounding shakuhachi, rarely heard but possibly even more hauntingly beautiful than the standard sized instrument.This was originally released on vinyl from a 1976 recording, so at 34 minutes it's rather a short CD, the recording is excellent, capturing every nuance."
3,Too much Washington nonsense,"There's a lot of interesting material in this book, but the narrow focus on the political machinations in Washington at the expense of the actual war quickly becomes tiresome. The coverage of the actual war on the ground is very thin. Also the author's support for the Vietcong and North Vietnam becomes irritating pretty quickly. I mean, sure the Americans and French did some stupid things and acted brutally on numerous occasions, but the Communist regime was and is incredibly repressive and violent towards its own people. The author's ideological blinders allow him to repeatedly brush this off."
1,Hysterical bombast masquerading as history,I've read everything about the Vietnam War I could get my hands on for the last 20 years and this shrill book stands out as the worst. I sorely regret having spent money on it. If you seek understanding of the conflict check out Sheehan's Bright Shining Lie instead.
3,"Actually, I give this 3.5 stars","This album was the first to feature David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes who replaced Ian Gillan and Roger Glover a year earlier and this is the best album to feature the new members of the band which isn't saying much for the Classic Mark 2 albums from the early 70's, the classic songs are Burn, Sail Away and Mistread, the good songs are You Fool No One and What's Going On Here, the rest of the songs are okay at best, overall this album is better than the Mark 1 era and the post '1970's albums and if you're new to Deep Purple or you're just a casual fan, get Machine Head or Fireball."
3,Watch out for the errata!!,"Although this is a great book, just like everyone who gave this book a good review. However, there are just tooooo many errors on spelling and syntax explanation. I gave this book 3 stars on the halfway from finish, simply because the frustration on checking the errors while studying through the book. There are currently 21 error corrections has been posted on wrox website, but there are a lot more that has not yet been notify.Just to name a few: pg.334 on the abbreviation of UTC, pg.325 error on the explain of syntax.Again, this is a great book! Errors are usually easy to be spot, and the correction can be easily figure out. However, Wrox can do better job then publish as such."
5,"The best, most informative programming book available!!","When obtaining a copy of this book I was amazed at how simple the examples were to follow.Step-by-step, line-by-line the code is broken down, analysed and then reproduced by you, the reader, making the learning process infinatley more rewarding and enjoyable.Paul Wilton, the author, has completley abolished the pre-conception of long winded and 'Geeky' books dedicated the the learning of a computer language.I suggest that anyone interested in learning JavaScript give this book a chance, it's heads and shoulders above the rest."
2,Not all the codes work/typo's???,"I purchased the kindle edition for this book when the local college textbook store was unable to fulfill the order after 6 weeks. It has become extremely frustrating to use, the code does not work for every tutorial. There are typo's in the code as well. An example, in chapter 3 the book shows code as br / and does not work but when I get the book code from my instructor the code reads as br and works fine. What the heck???? a / in the wrong place is a big deal when it comes to writing code, especially for a beginner."
3,Honestly Difficult Book for Amateurs,"I found this textbook a little useful for a previous online course I took. I took some notes about the decisions, loops, and function as well as anything else. I however had complication figuring how to do the coding and so for few of my assignments. I instead followed the tutorial exercises and applied the knowledge for later assignments.If I really want to do so well in HTML, CSS, web development, etc., I may prefer to get another JavaScript textbook instead of this particular one shown/mentioned above."
5,Beginning Javascript excellent book,"Can't say enough about this book. Really outstanding in explaining the how-to of Javascript, especially for the beginner. Truly an outstanding book! Thnak you."
2,Call It Javascript For Dim,"This book is intended for people who are new to programming at all,it is not for programmers beginners to javascript.It is good book for you if you do not know arrays,loops, database related topics(like sql)The topics are explained twice always ,first when the program is written and second after the code ends!!!It took long time for me to finish only primitives to extract what is already new for me.The book ends while I need it to be starting as practical examples for our real site construction needs.However the book is excellent language written , will organized and you can know what is javascript after 900 pages reading.If you are looking for a book to till javascript techniques and master it faster,Keep shopping around."
3,Book confuses the issues and doesn't get to the syntax,"Instead of defining all the attributes of say ""Request.QueryString"" into differenct contexts like Javascript <var> and HTML <input value=>, he muddles around with <Server-Side Scripting with ASP> probably the lamest web application environment around."
4,This disc is 'Expoobident' + 'Here's Lee Morgan',"The Charly UK pressing called Expoobident has the album's original tracks, plus the album tracks from 'Here's Lee Morgan.' They were both recorded originally on Vee-Jay records. (Expoobident's 'Triple Track' is mislabeled as 'Triple Threat', it seems.) If you're into such things, the session outtakes that are found on other pressings of the Expoobident CD are missing from the Charly version. (Some of the alternate takes are great, by the way.)"
3,Three Concerts on Japan (Osaka & Tokio),"Twenty one years after MADE IN JAPAN release, here are three concerts from which album was token. Digitally mixed from original tapes. The awesonme quality of these shows remains an impressive testament to the power of DEEP PURPLE on stage."
4,Very pulpy but kids liked it anyways,"I actually found this at a thrift shop for $2 and decided to give it a try. Like other comments it's VERY pulpy-more like the consistency of a smoothie. I didn't like the texture of the juice, but all three of my kids LOVED it, and kept asking for more! So for us, it's actually a pretty good gadget :)"
4,Very good shoe!,"I really like this shoe. I wear a narrow shoe and it is sometimes difficult to find narrow ones. However, this shoe runs quite narrow. I'm quite confident that it will ""streatch"" out with some wear as the shoe is genuine leather. All in all, I am pleased with the shoes."
3,women's tela sandals,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
3,soft spots,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
1,le bra,"It only covered the hood and came with two little pieces to cover the corner of the fender only. nothing else, doesn't look anything like the picture."
3,Good... but not great.,"While the game was enjoyable, it is noticably outdated and sometimes the controls are not quite responsive (i.e. it takes a few seconds before your units will begin to move). But you would like it if you are a C&C fan, but for everybody else should go straight to Red Alert 2... MUCH BETTER!"
5,A TERRIFIC SERIES,"THOUGH EACH EPISODE OF THIS 2 DISC, 315 MINUTE SERIES FOCUSES ON DIFFERENT PERSONS AND STORIES THE SAME BASIC THEME UNITES THEM PERFECTLY. THIS IS A REMARKABLE SHOW. BAFTA AWARD WINNER - BEST DRAMA SERIES. HEY BBC, WHERE'S THE NEXT 3 SERIES ??"
4,My Experiences,I really liked this book becuase when i was a freshman i tried out for the softball team and was scared. but i made it with flying colors and to find out if the bears do you'll have to read the book!
3,Cover,"CD is arrived before scheduled time, so this is OKBut cover is broken (outside and inside) and this is not OK"
1,Not even half-baked,"I don't know what the purpose is of rushing this book to the market. Wrox should be ashamed of itself.The .NET Compact technology preview version it is built on is pretty bad and this book is worse. It isn't realistic to write a book about an alpha product. To fill the pages, they discuss other issues not related to .NET CF and regurgitate the existing Microsoft documentation. The inane little projects featured in the book will not work - you can't even enter data!I'm hoping the bookstore will take this turkey back. This book is not even half-baked. Wait for a book based on the released product."
5,AMAZING,Craig Morris is brilliant and this book is simply the best. It helped me so much with my life and relationship with my computer and cat.
3,Great coffee table book,My family enjoyed these very charming and witty cartoons. The book contains an excellent collection of the famous Booth drawings.
4,good stuff,"Way better than cubes or crystals.. Has a strong celery taste, which I don't care for, so I use less than required and add flavored salt or combine with onion soup mix. Cheapest place I''ve found it is Target store."
3,Some Settling May Occur,"We were a big fan of this brand when Costco carried it and they had a much larger jar. We ordered this one hoping for a similar experience and although we should have noted that the jar size is smaller in ounces, it didn't explain why it was only 2/3 full. We would still consider it a good product, but not a good value on Amazon and we are sad to see it not stocked at Costco."
2,Mediocre / unorganized,"If you consider 10-day, 20-day and 40-day Donchian channel breakouts as 3 ""different"" systems, then yes, this book offers ~80 ""different"" systems. What peeved me was the fact that there were only 30 or so unique systems in the book. The other 50 were variations on the same theme. Half the book deals with various sorts of funky moving averages... not interesting, and not very useful. Also, the readability is extremely poor. It's a good buy at $15, but definitely not worth $50."
5,Excellent Book For ASP Developers to implement XML in ASP,The chapters are laid out properly and are easy to understand. It helped us to learn a great deal about incorporating XML into ASP.We recommend this book to anyone who wants to further expand their knowledge of XML in ASP.The authors did a really good job on explaing XML for ASP developers.The depth explainations of the case studies & examples and XML are really great and relate to real world examples.The chapter explaining about the SOAP is really good which helped us a lot personally to implement an in my current project . We personally thank Dinar Dalvi for his help and support to answer our questions and immediate feedback for our emails.
3,Machine Head...the best from Purple?,"I don`t see why most people think Machine Head is the best album by Purple? ok, it`s containing a few good songs and i`m agree that it`s a good record but if you listen to Made IN Japan you can really hear what Highway Star and Space Trucking is made for. But if I`m going to be honest i mean that the Machine Head studio album is quite boring compared to In Rock,Burn and Stormbringer! If you are into the vocalist Ian Gillian you can hear that his voice isn`t that interesting as in In Rock....his voice was getting tired."
5,nobody's gonna take my cd i'm gonna hear it all the year !!!,"it's a great cd it has such rock's classic songs like:highway star (10) this is great one of the best solos ever i think is one of the best that i've hearedmaybe i'm leo (9) it's a good song hear it you will like itpictures of home (9) this song is ""cool"" and ""sweat""never before (9) it's calm and a good songsmoke on the water (10) it shoul be 11 it's the the most recognoizable riff and its a great lyric one of the best songs everlazy (8.5) it's a lazy song but the piano solo saves this songspace truckin' (10) LETS GO TO THE space with this songbuy his cd (in amazon.com) and rock and roll !!!!!!!!"
5,This and In Rock are superior rock albums,"Some people will say ""Smoke On The Water"" give me a break, you call that great. To Answer those people, yes I do. The song might have (and still is) being played to death on classic rock stations, but it is still a great song. Onto other songs on this album -- ""Highway Star"", ""Lazy"", ""Space Truckin"", need I say more. Pick up this record and Deep Purple in Rock and if you enjoy them, then purchase the rest of their catolouge. I believe that you will like this record. Why do I believe it, because it bloody rules!!!!!!!"
4,"""Good tunes, man!"" -Chris Farley","These are really good tunes, but it dosen't deserve 5 tars. True, it's got Smoke on the Water and Highway Star, but about 25% of the album is filler. I dont care much for Maybe Im A Leo or Never Before. Never Before has an old beatles riff. But there are the good 5 songs that make it worthwhile. Highway Star, Pictures Of Home (my fav), Smoke On The Water, Lazy, and Space Trucking. So, this is a reasonable 6th album by Deep Purple. ENJOY!"
2,Just so so,These Audio Fidelity gold CD's become immediate collector items the second they stop releasing them. In my experience they're largely hit and miss. The quality of the original recording can't be improved upon and that appears to be the case here. I don't know if the original was loaded with hiss or some other noise but the upper frequencies are very attenuated on this recording. Very dry without much ambiance. I've heard better.
5,one of the greatest hard rock albums,"machine head is amongst my favourite hard rock albums.deep purple is my favourite band and this is their masterpiece.this classic album contains all their hits like highway star,space truckin and smoke on the water which is one of the greatest rock songs ever made.ignore the one star reviews and get this brilliant album.hugely recommended."
5,Mafalda is sooooo funny,Mafalda 8 is just like all other mafaldas except from all the ones I have read this is the funniest one so far!
5,One of his best,Not going to give away anything other than this involves Death's granddaughter. Her character seems to grow a bit in this one. Enjoy.
5,"Ah a little christmas cheer, Prachett style.","Well well well. Look who has something for every season. Discworld holidays can be a little strange sometimes, but this seems almost normal. Except for the part about killing pigs and birds and such so the sun will rise. This is the kind of book you can pull put at christmas and offend some people. This book in a lot of ways makes a mockery of christmas, as death is running the scene. This is the book I use to get new people into discworld. I hope you like it too. Definitly good to read again and again...~Rincewind"
4,Another highly amusing tale from terry Pratchett,"I have been a fan of the disc world novels for some time. This one remains true to the established tradition. Pratchett has created an alternative world in which all the things with which we are familiar are twisted around and turned inside out. Yet a trace of familiarity remains so that we are not completely lost. In this novel the Hogfather, a twisted version of our father Christmas, is kidnapped. Needless to mention this could have dire consequences for the disc world and a rescue plan needs to be put in place. Death himself decides to step into the breach. While dealing with the distribution of the toys himself, he manages to persuade a very reluctant grandaughter to carry out the rescue. This leads to some great detective work and many amusing situations. After many diversions all ends well. If you have a fairly warped sense of logic and enjoy Pratchett's sense of humour you will love this book."
2,The worst !,"This is probably the low end of anything he has written before or since.I've read the more recent ones, and some were quite funny, and if not just as much as the former, at least they were more intense and profound.But everything he wrote from about a year former or later to ""The Hogfather""should be buried and forgotten.God blees Terry Pratchett. He's given me such laughs. But not here."
4,Useful reference text,"This book is a bit dense but contains a plethora of useful theorems and information on Fourier analysis. It can be slightly impenetrable, but if you put in the necessary effort it is quite rewarding."
1,a gas,"I saw this movie in 1954 at the theater, and remember the audience howling with laughter AT Ava Gardner's acting. I would give this movie a --1."
3,Are the English really this squalid?,"Far from erotic, and far from entertaining, this movie doesn't quite manage to be disturbing, either --- at least to me. If a woman could enjoy the kind of rushed and awkward gropings this movie offers up, then I suppose a man could too. Could they have chosen a dingier, less comfortable floor to do it on every week? Couldn't the writer or director have provided a clue why we might care? As at least one critic has said, usually only the French can take all the joy out of sex to this degree."
4,Intimacy,"Great acting in all cases but the disc was not really ""like new."" In one place it stops for about a minute, then picks up again. I am not sure that I am not missing some of the film itself.This was a breakthrough film, for certain. Kerry Fox takes lots of risks and took her biggest in this one. Don't know much about Mark Rylance but thought he was amazing also. Fox is one of my favorites and I'd probably like anything she's in, as long as she's speaking English. :-) I think she's definitely one of the best as she always manages to transform herself into her characters. On the level of Streep or anybody currently acting...maybe better."
3,Bonking Brits Bring Beatification,"Expecting a bleak experience this was surprisingly funny, to the extent they could have got away with billing it as a comedy. Rylance delivers the goods (fnar,fnar) and Marion Faithfull does some acting too. Lurches from vulgar realism to melodrama and finally to some curious and somewhat unwarranted arthouse obtuseness. What was all that waffle about ""what was it like when you died?""The explicitness rather defeats the whole point of acting. Cue boring anecdote about Olivier and Hoffman on the set of 'Marathon Man'? Nah, I'll let you off. Did we need the one for the road? Maybe it was a rare authentic moment but I questioned why the director wanted me to stand by the door watching. Five seconds of truth is still truth. Presumably the actors were paid for their endeavours which beggars uncomfortable ethical questions about prostitution."
2,This game stinks..............BAD!,"This game is hard to control, even when the controls are on casual setting. the crosshairs used to shoot move around when you are trying to shoot something. i have shot down one plane in the 2 weeks i've had it. i am thinking of purchasing another Jane's product but i'm not sure that i want to take the risk of not liking it!"
3,Not as good as I remembered,"I have been replacing my old LPs with CDs wherever possible and this bargain-priced disc seemed worthwhile. But after playing it again, the songwriting just isn't up to all of the other Hayward solo releases. A couple of good tracks, so it wasn't a total waste of money. Better than paying for individual songs like the stupid people do."
4,Night Flight,"If you own Songwriter, than expect more of the same. Played back-to-back the two albums have consistency. This is not a Moody Blues album, however.Like Songwriter, select tracks here are wonderful and make the album worth getting for fans, though the entire record arc is lovely.Night Flight, Penumbra Moon, Face in the Crowd all have that special something and those Justin harmonies always get me..."
2,Hayward has done so much better,"I've lstened to just about everything Justin Hayward has written and performed. This is not his best. His 1996 release, ""The View From The Hill"" is a much better collection of his work."
1,fell off,dem boys fell off. just go buy their first two albums. and layzie is just that. layzie on the on the mic. their lyrics are not good and they no longer have anything good to rap about. beat are just average maybe a little below.
3,bone fell of from 2002.,"hey to the reviwer below me, bone's cd's are all great up to resurection. the art of war is the top 3 double album by the way.edit your review cause of the wrong stuff you said.I will delete this when I properly listen to it."
5,Bone Thugs Forever,"I am over 13 but dont have a account. I dont know y people r hatin on this album cause this is a awesome album from these two members of bone thugs. Favorite songs r whats friends,hip hop baby and everyday but the rest r good. I recommend this to anybody who listen to rap cause this is good and worth a listen. Hopefully bone can come back with a album cause this is not a bone album and this makes me want more of bone thugs. Anyways support these guys cause they did a great job on this album and check out new solo album from Layzie Bone It's Not A Game, Krayzie Bone Gemini: Good Vs. Evil and Bizzy Bone Alpha And Omega. Buy this album now u wont be disappointed with this purchase Peace"
2,where the F*** is the harmony at? stupid boney F***ers,"bizzy and layzie can do much better there style and harmnony at there the only good songs one here are what's friends,real life,blow you away,and everyday but this only if you a die hard fan"
2,WTF?!?!?!,YO MAN WAZZA WITH THIS CD??? WHERES MY HARDCORE BOYS FROM THE NAT THAT RAPPED BLOWED AND DIDNT GIVE A CARE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BREATH TAKING BASS BEATS THAT WAZ THE HARDEST IN THE INDUSTRY??? WHEN YOU FIND THE OLD BONE THUGS HIT ME UP.
5,WONDERFUL SHOW,"MANY CLASSICS FOR THE BABY-BOOMER GENERATION. THE YOUNG WILL HEAR SOME OF THE GREAT PRE-ROCK & ROLL SONGS YOUR PARENTS GREW UP TO.SO BUY IT FOR YOUR PARENTS : BIRTHDAY/ ANNIVERSARY, AND ENJOY A FAMILY SIT-DOWN WITH SOME (OR MOST) OF THE ORIGINAL GROUPS THAT WENT ON TO CREAT MODERN COUNTRY, COUNTRY/WESTERN AND JUST GREAT FOLK SONGS !!"
3,Nice diversion,"I found this little book to be a pretty enjoyable diversion. The only thing I would count as a negative would be all the self-help references; I understand why the authors included it, but not being a fan of self-help books and speakers, it was a little off-putting. But overall, I enjoyed the characters and the plot - finally a different angle on the ""chick lit"" scene."
1,Classic album ruined by remastering,"I love this album but my copy of the CD sounded like crap.Totally ruined by remastering.Some tracks had no drums or bass,others had been remixed horribly.Save your money and TRY to get the original UN remastered.Big disappointment."
4,Blues for Greeny,"4 Star record 5 Star playing by Peter Green. Like most Mayall recordings reviews revolve around the featured musician in the subject recording. Under the circumstances one is compelled to discuss Peter Green he makes Hard Road a real spooky soulful blues album. Had he not come in the wake of Clapton he would have reached at least the same status as his playing/writing/singing surpasses Clapton's. Just listen to the ""Supernatural"" and you can feel that Clapton and his imitators had a long way to go to match to Peter in 1966-67."
5,His best (so far),Mark Watson's earlier works showed promise and this one improves on past results. Great power pop.
5,"This is a good, thoughtful book","I have read several of Gierach's books and have enjoyed each of them. However, I think this one is better than the others that I have read. Maybe I've just gotten older, but this book seems more insightful and more humorous than the others I have read. If you are a fly fisherman, you will truly enjoy this book."
5,Just what I needed,We received the product in a timely fashion and it was just what we wanted and needed
1,Description is a lie ... !!!,Bought this cane especially for the GEL GRIP - should have read the reviews before purchasing. Very little of what is written in the description is true. This degree of deception can only be intentional.
5,Very useful item,"I strongly recommend this folding cane for persons who have had a knee surgery, specifically those who had a knee replacement, due to the very small room that occupies this item. They can take it everywhere, even in a small purse."
4,quality,i think this is best book onthat subject ion the 1991.....although some places the explations are not much clear but as the whole concepts/theory given in this book good for students.i
4,A good Twilight Zone type horror film,"I saw this on tv years ago. I believe it was made for tv. A pre-fame Bill Paxton has a small role as Tilly's older brother. It's a good entertaining movie. It's not gory. It's actually a rip-off of the George Romero film ""The Crazies"" from 1974. It's the exact same plot but Impulse is much, much better. I think there's also a Shatner version of Impulse from the 70's. Don't believe what L.Maltin says."
3,For Rank Beginners Only...,"Good introduction for rank beginners. However, the typos are horrendous. Misspelled words, puncutation (commas, etc.) in the wrong places, code with typos, etc. make this a frustrating read. There's also lots of duplication of code fragments from one page to the next (apparently to make the book a bit thicker). Superfluous bits of humor also add to the page count - ex. ""Poke your web page editor in the ribs to wake it up and type up the following...""With 10 authors on the billing, you'd think someone would have caught these errors. Appears to have been rushed off the press."
1,This Will Probably Be My Last WROX Book,"This is my first WROX book, but it will probably be my last. It is hard to concentrate on the topic when there are so many misspellings and grammar errors. The content appears like it is the authors' rough drafts. If I am going to pay $[money] for a book, I expect it to be professionally done. It makes you wonder whether you are actually being taught by people who know what they are talking about..."
2,Numerous Coding Errors,"The book is well written, but there are numerous errors in the example code. If you are new to programming, be prepared to spend alot of time figuring out why your newly programmed web pages will not work. If you have basic knowledge of HTML, then you should be able to navigate around the majority of mistakes in this book."
2,Unsatisfied,"Love ""The Elephants"" but the poster came damaged with a crease down the center that affects the entire poster. This could have been 5 stars but now I can only give it 2 because the poster is unframable."
2,oversensationalized,"Mila 18 is quite the book...unfortunately Mr. Uris, probably influenced somewhat by his extended writing about the Zionist movement and Israel, has ""caught the spirit"" and over-stated both the success of the warsaw ghetto uprising as well as creating a barely believable soap opera.If you really want the story of the warsaw ghetto uprising, read ""The Wall"" by John Hersey - practically the same story told better, written better, and less romaniticized.Not to say it's not a good book - but The Wall is just better."
5,Mila 18 is wonderful,Leon Uris is one of my favorite authors; he has a very distinct style in which he gives a detailed background of the history behind each character. The lines between fiction and history are so easily blurred in his novels that I find myself wondering what really happpened. Uris continues to amaze me! Each story that he tells is more powerful than the next. Mila 18 is wonderful.
4,Easiest cloth diaper,"I used them on my son for 6 months. They were so wonderfully soft and easy to use, once I got the hang of it. They are very thick, so they take awhile to dry. Overall, I loved them and I miss using them! If only the laundry fairy would visit!!"
5,Great vibe,"Great mix of dance and pop music. There are two or three clunkers on this disc, but the rest of the songs are fantastic."
3,C&C stunk too,"The only time I would ever play this game is if some body locked me in a room and said ""Play either C&C red alert or Dune 2000."" Sure,there are plenty of units and junk for all three houses, but do we really need westwood to show us that they can make another C&C that isn't a hit? The graphics are probably the worst part of Dune 2000. Westwood used the same engine for Red alert, and made the graphics even worse by including only one type of terrian: sand. There really isn't much to the sound, if fact so little that I can't remember. The only reason you would ever want to spend your perfectly good money on this is if you are a die hard Dune and C&C fan who is bored out of their mind. Even then, prepare for another trip to the game store in a week."
5,Sergiu Luca plays Bach's Sonatas & Partitas for solo violin,"Perhaps there is no more pure form of JS Bach than his Sonatas & Partitas for solo violin. One person, one instrument, pure music.I love Luca's interpretation. My feeling is that Luca is playing these for himself, for Bach and for the MUSIC! There is no fancy virtuosity or showmanship here, just the sheer joy of playing the essence of the greatest composer to have ever lived.To me Luca's interpretation sounds like he's playing them on his day off, alone in his room for the personal pleasure of the wonderful music and it's art."
4,A welcome change of sound from this Seattle musician.,"Heather Duby delivers a solid performance in ""Come Across the River"", which is a welcome departure from the new-age sound of her Sub Pop debut. While the songs that rely solely on piano and vocals are a bit too melodramatic, the more instrumented songs dominate this album, and tunes like ""Three Miles"" with dual vocal melodies and the support of a full band show her power as a songwriter.These songs are catchy and fantastic. Definitely an album worth checking out!"
2,Much smaller in real life,"I was pretty disappointed when I received the Libman Curved Kitchen Brush. It is much smaller in person than what you imagine it to be from the pictures. The handle is about 5"" long, and the bristle part is between 1 1/2 and 2"" in diameter. The bristles are very stiff at first, but ease up a little with use. Bottom line: if you are looking for a small scrub brush with very stiff bristles, this is for you, if not, look elsewhere!"
4,Strong remastering effort,"Regardless of one's opinion about this particular album, I must say that I am very pleased with the remastering by Hayward / Parodi. Many sounds burried in the previous CD release are now clearly apparent. Also, the cymbals and guitars have much more definition and zing. The whole presentation now finally comes to life and doesn't sound like they are playing somewhere on the next mountain top. Warning to vinyl lovers: this disc still has that ""edgy"" CD sound at times, albeit it is very slight. Why this wasn't this released as a hybrid SACD with its more analogue sound qualities is beyond me. And why no 5.1 remix...oh well."
4,a fine album if you can get past the passed,"I like this album. A lot.Now, in fairness, this is when I *started* listening the the Moody Blues. Saw them promote it in concert. In fact, it's my favourite Moodies album.Yes, it's somewhat radio-friendly. What of it? The last four tunes flow nicely and weave a splendid sonic tapestry. Driftwood is one of Hayward's finest tracks. And Lodge's opening number is delightful.No, it's not a theme album. But I find that it has aged better than it's 60's & early 70's siblings. It's good, solid, minimally pretentious pop music.So there. Nyah nah nah boo boo."
2,A question of unbalanced,"Buy only if you collect the M.B.'s. This release has three, maybe four songs worth capturing."
5,The Book Every Homeowner Should Own,Excellent informative book covering topics that every homeowner will eventually have to deal with. A must have!
1,WHO DID THE PROOF READING!!!!!!,YOU MAKE REFERENCE TO FICK v. NELSON (1950) THERE IS NO SUCH CASE. WHO DID YOUR PROOF READING? THERE IS A FICK v. NILSON (1950). HOW FRUSTRATING DO YOU THINK A PERSON WOULD GET LOOKING FOR A CASE THAT DOESN'T EXIST?
2,overrated and only one step above cute,"It seems that the positive review of this book in the NY Times Book Review started a stampede towards it. Me too, but in the end I found it a decently written shrug but certainly not much more than that."
5,Accurate and Legible,"The scale is perfect. It is accurate, easy to use and very legible. I have been dieting (successfully, thank God) and need to keep on top of my weight every day, both for my progress and to control my diabetes. This has been very accurate, so much so, that it is the same as my weight in the doctor's office."
4,Survey of Bible Doctrine,"Covers a variety of doctrines in a clear, understandable, organized fashion. VERY appropriate for a Survey of Bible Doctrine course."
2,Useless,It is poorly made and does not work. Basecally useless. But it is cheap so the damage is limited. Not worth returning.
4,Gritty novel of survival in the desert,"Diverse parties of white men and women converge at an isolated water hole in the Arizona desert and battle Apaches, the elements, thirst and each other. Hero Logan Cates takes charge of the small band of whites who bicker among themselves between Indian attacks and his leadership is what keeps them alive through the tortuous days and nights as they are pinned down by an unseen but determined enemy. The characters are detailed and the author gives them their own personalities and strange quirks that make the story believable. A good, quick read by Louis L'Amour."
4,very good,It is definitely not a beginner book.But all the chapters are good even though it was written by different authors.The section on refactoring in the beginning set the tone of the book. Good authors. Would recommend this book to anyone working with jsps. Very easy language to understand too. The reason I gave it a 4 is 'coz I understood it more only after I began working with jsps for a while.
2,AHK!!,"I'm sorry to say that this cd has to be the worst that my favorite band has ever come up with. I own every cd this band has ever created (along with interviews and video clips) and all of them rocked except for this one, and it is a huge dissapointment. I would have given it just 1 star if it wasen't Bon Jovi, I had nothing but respect for this band until now.:( I'll think I stick with the orginal versions of the songs after hearing this cd."
1,what the F?,"Frankly, I'm not real sure what any of you are talking about. This cd is horrible. They butchered every song. This cd will make you depressed. I feel embarrassed for them releasing this load of crap."
2,This left doesn't feel right!.....2.5 maybe,"I am a pretty big Bon Jovi fan. It's the first hard rock i ever discovered. But this cd is probably their worst yet. I bought it a couple days after it came out, and i was disappointed. Even after a few of the songs grew on me, it's still pushing it to give it a 2.5 out of 5. This would have been a five star cd if there wasn't a ""twist"". I would disagree with recommending this to hard core Bon Jovi fans. I think you'll hate it. i would say maybe if you're new to Bon Jovi. But even then, you're still missing out from the real version. What have you done with the classics Jon!!!????"
2,NOT a greatest hits album,I purchased this thinking it was a greatest hits album. It is not. It is alternate versions of Bon Jovi's popular songs - like Sting's Symphonicities. I was disappointed when I received it but that's my problem for not looking at what I was actually buying. Because it was not what I expected I have not given it much of a listen. Maybe some day.
3,it's just a (mis)step to the left!,"This was so not what I was looking for. I saw the name `Bon Jovi' and the list of songs on it and thought ""cool"" just what I wanted. WRONG! It is Bon Jovi doing the songs listed but they are unplugged, bluesy versions. Since I was already to rock out when I turned it on, you can imagine my surprise. I would have been shocked but it was too mellow.It's my fault. I didn't read the reviews better and should have questioned the title but there you go. I will probably enjoy this on rainy days and long car rides but considering I was looking for a Bon Jovi record with the rocking tunes that made the band the power it is this is a major disappointment.From a musical perspective they were very nice. If you are a big fan this will be fun to see what they did with their stuff but if, like me, you are looking for a CD with the hard rocking you're use to from the radio, this ain't it."
4,suzyq,"Probably haven't listen to Bon Jovi since the 80's, so I saw this CD and thought I'd give it a try. I'm really glad I did. I listen to this CD a lot! I happen to love the way the band gave all their greatest hits a new twist. I'm surprised it's gotten such negative reviews, even prefer it over their most recent CD."
1,"Exit Stage Left, Please!!","This is absolutely THE worst. Sounds like this group is singing at carnivals in their 70's, or singing in a nursing home. How pitiful, how humiliating, how horrible. I expected much more from Bon Jovi, and I only borrowed it, THANK GOD!"
1,This was a wrong turn,Sounds like a cheesy Las Vegas lounge act doing covers of Bon Jovi songs. Check out Joe Bonamassa or Mark Selby for some great new music.
4,Amazing,"To be honest, at first I was a little diappointed, but after listening to the CD a couple of times...I LOVE IT!! There's a bluesy and sexier feel to the music. You get a different feeling and you have a different interpretation of the music. A MUST HAVE in your CD Collection."
3,This Left Feels Right,I love the songs the way they were and I'm not very happy with the new way.Can't wait for some new music...
3,Bring it back to Jersey,"I have been a fan since 1983 and Runaway. I'm from Jersey and know his roots. I just can't grasp this new twist. I had the same reaction as most did ..."" what the H@#$"" is this?!!"" I still can't tell if I like it or hate it, giving it 3 stars. John has an amazing voice and all musical talent that has never been truly showcased. I will buy the CD, for all true Bon Jovi fans have to have the whole library. Will I listen to it? Maybe while cleaning or in the car on occasion. Will I promote it, NO. BonJovi is and always will be a ""rock"" band. Rock bands do make ballad albums, or twists to their music. Just don't do it with the classics. Come out with a BRAND NEW version of their music with new songs, that way we diehards don't pass out when we hear our favorites remixed. Can't wait for the next RIGHT album, with all LEFT music, just not this."
5,Awesome + Great make out music,"This record is great - I am a Bon Jovi fan of 15 years, a musician, and avid music fan. I'll tell ya what though, I didn't even go see the band on the Bounce tour b/c I couldn't stand the thought of having to hear Living on a Prayer, Bad Name, and other overplayed ""classics"" ever again!!! Thank the maker for this disc, what an incredible achievement by the band. They have grown, matured, artistically grown, and there is such a good vibe throughout the record. I've always enjoyed Bon Jovi's covers/interpretation of other artists - now they do their own. Currently, considering how tired I am of listening to the old bon jovi catalog, this is easily my favorite album. And, best of all, if you're looking for a little ""mood music,"" if this record doesn't get you laid, then you don't even have a prayer, my friend."
2,Too Left Foot for Me,"Love Bon Jovi and love these songs, but not this CD. Do not like the arrangements. These songs are better as they were done orignially. Sometimes it's best to leave perfection alone. Listened to the CD once then gave it away"
2,Not what I thought,"I have absolutely loved Bon Jovi since the mid 80's, however, this CD is not at all what I expected. The band grew on me because they had a rock 'n roll image and not too hardcore rock but not soft rock. It seems to me that since they are all getting older that their music is getting softer. I'd like to hear some new rock 'n roll, not remakes of the classics. It hurts me to rate this album so low but it's how I feel. My husband couldn't even make it through listening to one whole song on the CD :-("
3,It's growing on me...,"Okay, I have been a Bon Jovi fan since Slippery came out back in the day. Remember sitting in your room after school, not wanting to do your homework while ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" was blaring on the jam box? Well, I don't think this album will instill those ""good 'ol day"" memories, but it is definitely worth a listen. I was actually hoping for more of an acoustic album, especially since the Jersey boys have been on more of an acoustic kick as of late. But if you are looking for an album that you can chill out to or relax to after a long day at work, this album just might do the trick. If you are just discovering Bon Jovi for the first time, I would not recommend this album. But those who have heard it all and want something different, this is... well... different. I give them props for putting this out there, because the album shows yet another angle of their musical diversity. It's definitely growing on me."
1,the worst,this could very well be the worst album that i have ever purchased . the album was not done very well . artist needs to rethink this one !!!!!!!!
2,Bon Jovi at their worst!,"Big time waste of money. The songs have some merit, therefore they get two stars, but this is strictly on their individual merit. As a huge Bon Jovi fan these songs are horrible and take away the feel of the music and the reason I love Bon Jovi music!"
1,This Sucks (sorry Jon Bon),"Man, I love Bon Jovi.........i am a total fan, and when I heard that they had a greatest hits album comming out..i was psyched...then i listened to it on Amazon (thanks guys) they saved me from wasting the 14 dollars. I can not believe that bon jovi would totally destroy their old classics like this! Sorry guys, but this was definately not your best work...."
1,this is in no way right,"I thought that I was buying a greatest hits collection, but I purchased this at a store and had know idea it was with a twist. The cd case does not have it labled on the outside. Needless to say I am upset that I spent the money and ended up with a horrible cd and out of fourteen bucks. Please make sure to listen to the tracks before you decide to purchase this item."
4,Good medicine.,"Be warned, these are NOT the original versions of these songs. What ""Hits With A Twist"" means, is their more popular songs reworked with more sparse, acoustic arrangements. Old songs in a new light, if you will. Included is ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"", ""Livin' On A Prayer"", ""You Give Love A Bad Name"", and ""It's My Life"", as well as the softies ""Bed Of Roses"", ""Always"", and ""I'll Be There For You"". Some favorites are missing, but what can you do. Overall, this is a good and interesting collection, but personally, I'd stick with ""Cross Road""."
4,The music grows on you... not bad at all,"Well I bought the CD and at first I wasn't feeling this style of the songs. However, I listened and continue to listen to the whole CD and I must admit, I am now enjoying the different style. I am a big BJ fan and this CD offers a different range/style to the songs. Its a nice acoustic style versus the hard core guitar that you normally hear from BJ. Jon's voice is awesome. My only downer is there is not much of Richie's voice heard through-out the CD. Jon sings all the songs himself. All in all, I think a great new arrangement and style to the past hits. You can play this CD while entertaining friends because of its mellow acoustic style. These guys are indeed very talented musicians. Keep up the good work BJ!"
2,TOO Soft,"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1984 and I always loved the postive additude and hard loud music. Even their Monster Ballets like my Fav ""Bed Of Roses"" were loud hard and perfect. This Album is so different. Don't get me wrong I love to hear Jon's voice on anything, but this is to soft for the best rock band in the world. They shouldn't have messed with perfection. So Bon Jovi lets ""Raise Your hands"", ""Let it Rock!!!!"" and lets Go ""Wild In the Streets"" Because ""It's My Life""LoveBonjovicats@yahoo.com"
2,pretty lame,"To those who gave this 5 stars (the crowd who would drink J.B.J.s bathwater), I have to respectfully disagree. While ""It's My Life"", ""Bed of Roses"" and ""Always"" are shining moments, and ""Keep the Faith"" and ""Wanted"" are interesting, this is a overall weak release. Also for the confusion about why the songs are sung how they are, I believe it's 'cause it's very hard for Jon to sing many of the songs the way they were originally recorded because somewhere during the last tour he blew out his voice. (Someone who saw them recently would likely concur).In a way, a release like this is a clever way to not advertise that."
3,Twist is definately the word,"Yes, i have to grant Jon, this album is very good, but you have to have a very variable taste. This album in some cases is not even rock at all, it has become acoustic instead! Also Jon's vocals are very single tone rather than having the range like in his classics.So my conclusion is...if you are a Bon Jovi fan craving for rock, this is not the album for youIf you like bon jovi and have a variable taste in music, go for it, you'll like this one"
1,Bon Jovi nothing better to do?,"Ack! I just heard a friends copy of this CD tonight and this is sad. Bon Jovi got nothing better to do then to slaughter 12 of their best hits? Not that this couldnt have been decent, if they had played these songs accoustically with a little heart and effort, it could have been an interesting CD. Maybe not a top seller or something to shout from the mountain tops about but at least something half way enjoyable. Honestly as it is, I dont think Bon Jovi could have made this worse (even had they tried). Unless maybe they all got loaded to the T and staggered into the recording studio and went at it. Then again, maybe it would have been BETTER? This CD stinks period!"
3,Only for real Bon Jovi fans,"This album would be a great ""greatest hits"" CD if it were not for the fact that every single song has been remade with an acoustic sound. The songs sound alright, but they are not rock music, they are not the same as the real version which I love."
5,This Left Feels Right,"Greatest Hits With A Twist. Un unexpected twist, but a good twist. Album only grows the more I listen."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","Have to agree with R. Graves' comments. Reading the liner notes, I got all excited because it talked like this was going to be an all acoustic version of these fabulous songs; then I continued to read and discovered the songs had been totally remade!The only remake ever to sound just as good as the original and be a totally different song is Eric Clapton's ""Layla"".Sorry, guys, I love ya dearly, but stay with what works!"
1,Twist is back...,"Here I was expecting a ""greatest hits"" CD but what I have is absolutely terrible. I can't find a single person who actually likes it either. I wish I would have listened to it prior to buying it. Listen before you buy! I looked at the listing of songs and thought ""I like all of those"" but I don't like them this way. Total disappointment. Save your money."
4,This Left Feels Right,"I'm a die-hard Bon Jovi fan since the beginning so I had to have this in my collection. For die hard fans like myself it's a MUST HAVE!! Especially the one w/the bonus dvd. The first time I listened to this cd, after the first 3 songs and I was very disappointed, however, after listening further it improved. It's growing on me alot more now, but ""Living on a Prayer"" is just awful with that woman singing. I was told she was the producers wife, but she's horrible and ruined the song. Jon should have sang it by himself or with Richie, not this woman!!! The rest of the cd isnt too bad, I really like ""It's my Life"" and ""Everyday"", but there's still a few that need some getting used too."
2,Elevator Music!,"I was so disappointed in this cd. It seems to me that the band took their greatest songs and zapped every ounce of energy out of them. They sound like elevator music, bland and out of rhythm with the way they are supposed to sound. I still love Bon Jovi, but get their Crossroads album instead. It has a great toned down version of Living On a Prayer that became beautiful instead of boring."
1,Grampa's CD ............TLFR was definitely wrong..... !,"I think it will go down like ""New Coke""! JBJ stick to what you do best rockin out !Elevator music sounds better.Seems to me this album was just another way of milking the fans... ! As a long time fan your ""Bounce"" tour at the Giants Stadium was Awesome...! Unfortunately this Sucks Bigtime...! The unplugged show on MTV you guys brought the house down with your acoustic renditions of your songs.Hope you guys get back on the right track making cool music!This CD should have been titled ""Detour to Nowhere....!"" Songs on this CD sound like stripped down demos to me, not new arrangements ? Do you need the money that bad to release this GARBAGE !Although there will be many that will buy anything from the Bon Jovi band no matter how ""..Bad.."" Unfortunately.....!"
4,Nite lights from Amazon??,"It's an ok product, but why buy from Amazon when it is half the price at Walmart?"
3,"A bit ""over the top"", but a nice read","Though not a literary gem, this story is an accurate depiction of life in ancient Rome. It gets too preachy at times for a novel, but is still enjoyable."
5,Great Music,"This is a CD that anybody would love. Every song on this is superb, espescially ""This Morning"" and ""Saved By The Music"". Justin and John are probably the best artists of the century, and this is where their talent shows."
5,One of the very best albums of the 1970's!,"Blue Jays was Justin Hayward and John Lodge's collaborative album created during the period when the Moody Blues had broken up as a group. To all of us Moody's junkies, it was like a breath of fresh air. All of the solo efforts by the members of the band were all right, but none of them had the distinctive""Moody Blues Feeling"" about them that we all missed. I tend to think of ""Blue Jays"" as another one of the ""core seven"" moody blues albums, as it invokes the same kind of feelings in the listener that they do. If you are a fan of the early Moody Blues (or Barclay James Harvest, Procol Harem, Camel, etc.)then you will love this CD. It is John and Justin at the peak of their ability, when they were still passionate about their music and their message. Buy this CD, you won't regret it."
1,Shameful Bigotry Disguised as Academia,"This sophomoric rant is pure bigotry disguised as a ""serious thought-provoking look at transsexualism"". The idea of transsexuals as a construct of male surgeons who have designed them in order to subvert the women's movement would be laughable if so many misguided souls had not actually BELIEVED this tripe to be the truth! Ms. Raymond does an extreme disservice to the gender rights movement and to queer people everywhere, and sets back the women's movement 20 years by pitting us against each other. ""Gender rights are human rights"" - we need to stick togethor to fight the oppression of society, not get derailed into bickering that is generated by texts such as this. If anyone want's to read a book that SERIOUSLY examines transsexuality in the light of gender rights, then read Riki Anne Wilchen's ""Read My Lips - Sexual Subversion and the End of Gender"". Don't waste your money on this junk!"
1,Boring,"Yanks is one of those classic movies that goes absolutely nowhere. Film begins, he kinda gets the girl but never really does get the girl, and then you think he has the girl, then he doesn't, then he leaves and no one cares. The End. Regardless, if you want to see some zany America-hating going on and no extras whatsoever, you've come to the right DVD."
1,false,"this is false advertising, it says pack of 2 but when i received it there was only one, I called and they said it was only sold as indivuals...."
3,Not the best but a must read if you are following the series,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewInto The Night, the fifth book in the Navy SEAL Saga of Suzanne Brockmann, surely promises a lot of action, laughter and excitement. Readers of the series will be happy to meet those sexy SEALs of Team sixteen again in this book. Mike and Joan's on and off romance may make you feel a bit frustrating but the love and romance of Charlotte and Vincent will surely make you forget Mike and Joan temporarily. For Sam and Mary Lou, we will need to find out what Ms Brockmann's plan with them in the next book of the series. Once again, it is highly recommended to read the series in order so you won't miss out any guys of the Team sixteen."
4,Hillariously sweet,"The story of Mike Muldoon was one that kept me laughing all thoughout the book. And there was sweet parts between Mike and Joan, as well as chummy parts between Sam, Cosmo and Mike. Mike was a character that I loved. It was a really good book in that it flowed really nicely and entertained. I also liked that we got to know a little more about Mary Lou and Donny, the crazy neighbor. Mary Lou was one of those characters who I had a little trouble liking in ""Gone Too Far"", although that book comes after this one, but ""GTF"" was the first in the series that I had read. I have also liked ""Over the Edge"" and I can't wait to read Cosmo's story, in ""Hot Target"". Very exciting. I can't wait til all the stories come into place as I chip away, one book at a time. Suzanne, keep up the good work."
3,Ok three and a half stars,"Thats how I felt after I finished Into the Night... Although I felt compassion for Mary Lou, can't say I LIKE her, but I hope she gets her HEA (happily ever after) I really liked Mike alot, but Joan didn't do it for me as a worthy match for Mike... This was the hardest one for me to get thru of the full series, but its still one you need to read to get a reminder of everyone, and stay in sync... I thought the book was slow paced, and I know Sam and Alyssa's book is going to be awesome, because well ITS SAM AND ALYSSA'S BOOK! Anyways overall I feel it wasn't anywhere near the intensity of the other books in the series, but it did have some good moments... Although I can't think of any that involved Joan... Kelly from Unsung hero and Molly from Out of Control are still my fav girls..."
4,A little sad,"Not quite up to snuff if you adored the free-wheeling, hippy days of the commune and Zonker. This deals with more real-life issues, but still with humor."
1,"lots of hype, little analysis","This book is very ideological and weak on the science. If you want to read more, Google the online review in American Scientist."
1,"Monsanto paid Fumento $60,000 to write this book.","Business Week reported that Fumento had solicited money from Monsanto to support a book on biotechnology that he proposed to write. Monsanto paid $60,000 to the Hudson Institute think tank, where Fumento is a fellow, most of which, Fumento said, was ""folded into"" his salary. Fumento's book BioEvolution praises Monsanto's work in biotechnology; he has also written columns praising Monsanto.-[See:] Javers, E. A coumnist backed by Monsanto. Business Week. January 13, 2006.[-Kosta, Louise. Policy Watch: Influence Watch: Long-time MCS 'debunker' caught in pundit payola scandal. The Human Ecologist. Summer 2006.]"
4,Good Movie/Poor Accuracy,"The movie was awsome, but not realistic at all. Nothing was real. If it was true I would be thrilled.The movie was great, but the price is WAY to much!! And, how is the DVD less? >:-("
4,Sheer bad fun,"Hokey hokey hokey. Dear God, I'm glad I didn't watch this when it first came out. The hilarity would be nowhere NEAR as side splitting before I got a bit more in tune with my techno side.Great cast (and yes, I'm the only person on the planet who doesn't think Angelina Jolie is the shizzy), hilarious dialogue, and a ""just this side of almost approaching semi-plausible"" premise, coupled with a great score and some spiffy graphics and you have a good flick to watch whilst drunk, high, or just in the mood for some amusement. The addition of the delicious Jesse Bradford only makes it that much better.Of particular amusement factor are the views ""inside the computer."" Damn, I can see why they opted for fanciful high-tech graphics rather than a bland succession of ASCII scrolling across the screen.So bad it's good."
5,Good show!,"Suburban teens, techno music, cyber-crime and Angelina Jolie!? Who in their right mind could ask for anything More?No but on a serious note, this movie rocks. Angelina is dead sexy, and the rest of the cast makes for a great movie. The soundtrack is my favorite of all time. This movie is a mood setter, its all around fun to watch"
3,forgetable but acceptable entertainment,"This film is unlikely to make anyone's top 10 movies of all time but it is worth 2 hrs of your time. Dont expect to get taken anywhere by this film , it is pure entertainment in the hollywood 21st century style. It's safe for kids and grandparents, though there were some suggestions of cross dressing and some tongue kissing. The best part of the film was Angelina Jolie, I have never taken much notice of her before nor been terribly impressed, but she really sizzles in this one. Maybe its the short hair and teenage dress, maybe its my middle aged longing, whichever - she sure looks hot (and acts ok too). To sum up, there is no drug taking and the baddy gets it in the end, boy gets girl and everyone goes home happy (except the baddy who will presumably spend his remaining days being poked by hot forks when he least expects it)."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With its ridiculous villains (Why Dr. Melfi? Why?), bland lead, and tired plot, Hackers doesn't even manage to be interesting, let alone memorable or good."
5,The Best Computer Film Ever!,"This movie is so tight,It makes you want to go get on your computer.I love it,one of my favorite movies."
1,Barely viewable,"I think I need to warn normal people that this movie is not all that great. A disturbed teenager needing vicarious victories over the establishment and adults will ignore the faults, technical and otherwise of this useless flick. The hero gets the girl, but it isn't much of an accomplishment considering her lack of selectivity early in the movie. This movie just won entry in to my worst ten, lifetime."
5,Hackers DVD,"I have been into computer programming since you had to store software on cassette tape. Hackers is a movie which takes you back to when telephone connections were done by placing the phone-handset into rubber cups. I have to admit that I have done some hacking back in the day so for me, the movie was a blast from the past."
2,Waste of talent.,"Although this movie does show the true spirit of Hackers,it is flawed in plot,style,dialogue and design.I have never seen such sweet graphics on my computer.I have never ever met a Hacker who was as pleasing to the eye as Jolie.{although to be fair i have only met 2 or 3 people in my life as good looking as Jolie}I also have never seen anyone wear a body suit in new york.But the really wink link of the movie is the awful way they try to present this over cliched good vs bad thing."
4,Hack me any time baby!,"This film is good,however, does anyone believe that these people are real hackers. If it was true to life they would've all had specs, spots and scruffy hair. Hey, this is Hollywood so we'll make the leads good-looking, especially Jolie, and we've got a nice little earner on our hands.The movie, it's got seriously bad dress sense even for a geek haven, the acting isn't good and the soundtrack only sounds good on the film and not on the CD! However, this film is very watchable due to the chemistry between the two leads who lock horns against each other for supremacy of cyberspace. In my opinion, the fact that they're all being framed with the potential of a very long prison sentence holds no signifigance in the movie for me at all.In a paragraph, the films good, there's good chemistry between the two leads. It's very fun to watch and you can't help but be drawn into the latest slice of waffle that Hollywood has served up...."
4,The movie has gone golden here,"With Angelina Jolie officially a super star this movie is becoming ageek cult classic like TronTron.The graphics are good and filming is nice.It is the kids on the outside against the lamestraights on the inside, with a joker in the deck.In the late 70's poor people couldn't get online: it just wasn't possible without megabucks.By 1998 it became possible for ordinary people to dial up.So movies about geek exploits became about myths of super-hackers.It is the ""wish you could"" type of movie where the geek gets the super chick."
2,Jolie is hot but thats not enough,This movie was horrible on all levels even though that one chick is eye candy
2,Spyro! a heros tail?,"i am a huge spyro fan, i have been playing since the first one, which was great, the second one better, the third one, ok, forth one What happened!! this one, after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so, it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating, you never seem to get anywhere. all the voices have changed. if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games, dont buy this and dont be disapointed. however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game."
5,product exactly as decribed,game was in great shape and my grandaughter plays it all the time Spyro is her favorite.
4,fun but hard and freaky characters,I have this game on my PS2 and it's fun and all but the pink dragon makes my spine tingle.I mean she has this hypnotic stare and she's trying to take MY spyro. and you know what else is dumb there's no life bar so you can't see if your'e dying. the boss battles are soooooooooooo stupid and sooooooooo easy and you know what the enimes get dumber and dumber by the seccond so if you played this game and if your'e on my side youre'A. a spyro maniac B. you hate ember
2,Good music for people who don't like music...,"I lump White Stripes into the same category as the Dave Matthews Band in the sense that their fans don't typically listen to a lot of music. They like whatever they hear and don't give it too much thought.Specifically, this album (like any WS discs) contains nothing that many other bands aren't doing better. So, look around - you're bound to find something that you'll like better. Unless, of course, you just want to buy whatever Rolling Stone or Time Magazine is drooling over this week (last week it was Acrade Fire)."
1,A bold new direction Indeed,"Satan is offended his name is attached to this album. I appreciate when bands go in a bold new direction as much as thenext fan. Unfortunatly I think this album lacks the fire, energy and passion previous 'stripes' CDs have displayed. In addition to that the instrementation on this thing is sub-standard at best. Jack sounds like his hand was still in acast while he was laying down these tracks. Dont make thisthe first stripes album you buy. I'd recommend De stijhl orElephant, two very well balanced albums."
5,More challenging than the past albums,"I had to listen to the CD a few times to really appreciate it. It certainly gets finer after every listen. Its not electric guitar-oriented blues like DeStijl (my favorite). Instead they use a great deal of acoustic instruments, like piano, marimba and acoustic guitar. Some people say this is a transition album. I think its more evolution than transition. Jack's trying to push the limits of his music. Outstanding effort."
1,I really wanted to like this album...,"I am not a just a ""casual fan who likes radio-friendly hits."" I have been a hardcore White Stripes fan ever since I heard their self-titled debut. I love everything that the Stripes put out, which is why I am so surprised at how awful this album is. It is incredibly boring from start to finish - so boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire CD. I appreciate that Jack is trying to ""experiment"" with different sounds, but it just doesn't work. This CD lacks the raw emotion, energy, and passion that I have come to expect from the band. The songs are dull and repetitive and soooooooooo looooooooonnnngggg, it's enough to put you to sleep!! I can only hope that the next album is better than this one."
1,Has Music Really Gotten this Bad,"I guess I just don't get it. Did one reviewer actually compare this piece of crap to Exile on Main Street? Has rock gotten this bad? If you can string a couple of words together, play competent rhythm guitar, sing somewhat in tune, does this make you a genuis? I guess I am just out of the loop, but how are you supposed to take groups like this seriously when you grew up with such great music. The only song here I can listen to is I am lonely but not that lonely yet."
2,"Get Behind Me Satan, The White Stripes","Found most tracks to be very lethargic, something to listen to on a Sunday afternoon after dinner."
3,"no guitar, no good","A little dissapointed by the fact that jack white (one of the best guitarists around)decided to bore us with his piano, mirambs, and acoustic snoozers. Really some of these songs will put you to sleep. Although blue orchid, doorbell, and denial twist are good songs, there are just too many boring ballads, wierd experiments, and especialy bad lyrics in this album."
1,horrible album,"im a big white stripes fan and i really hated this album, i got it and drove back to work, as i reached work i already realized im gonna sell it to the music store by my house that buys used cds.i listen to 9 of the 13 songs and didnt like one of them. i cant see how people call this a masterpiece. i think Elephant was a masterpiece, i loved that album but this one is SOOOOOO different.its slow, mellow, weak sounding and VERY blue-grassy sounding. jack doesnt even play guitar in 80% of these songs. he plays the piano, tamborine, shakers and everything else but the guitar.im not knocking the White Stripes and i am still a fan but ill keep listening to their others because i really hated this one.i say dont buy it, borrow or download a song or two and dont judge the album by ""blue orchid"", i did because i like that song but the rest is NOTHING like the single on the radio."
3,Going California,"Impressive melodies and more artistic than ever before. The songs are catchy but, not long lasting. They are too young to evolve so quickly. Meg shouldn't sing.Their Zeppelin/Plant influence is all over the album.Perhaps Mr. Plant should hire them to write some real music for his next album!! Or how about a duet?"
2,"A Sad, Over-Hyped Step Backwards","I own every White Stripes album to date. I've seen them live. I consider them one of my favorite bands that are around today. So saying this hurts me very much: ""Get Behind Me Satan"" is easily the Stripes' worst album. As a single, ""Blue Orchid"" is probably the worst they've ever made. Jack sounds like he's trying too hard to re-create the magic of ""Seven Nation Army"", and it doesn't work. Then songs like ""The Nurse"" and ""Little Ghost"" are quirky to a fault, sounding totally out of place and very disjointed. But it's not all terrible. Songs like ""Take, Take, Take"" and ""The Denial Twist"" evoke the spirit of ""Elephant"" and ""White Blood Cells"", while ""Red Rain"" takes them back to their best album, ""De Stijl"". However, as much as they try to re-create the sounds, this album can't possibly live up to their earlier work. A weirder album does not mean a better one."
2,WHERE DID THE WHITE STRIPES GO?????????,"The White Stripes were amazing with the rock-based album Elephant. Get Behind Me Satan is a pathetic excuse for a rock album minus the song Blue Orchid. It is slow and there is too much piano compared to earlier CDs where the White Stripes masterfully used the guitar. If you like bluegrass, get it, but otherwise, just buy Elephant and be content with the music from that album."
2,When are they going to stop making demos?,"I am sorry but I can't help but thinking while listening to this album when they might consider actually releasing an album and not demos. An inability to control sound levels isn't artistic or quirky it is just lazy. I can't say that there aren't some songs that have promise but not as they stand, and it sure the hell isn't Led Zeppelin so stop comparing it.This album is just tedious to listen to most of the time and when it isn't the chord progressions are just plain unimaginative and the drums constant mashing of cymbals makes it unbearable."
2,extremely dissapointing,"First of all, I love the white stripes old stuff. I love they're raw sound and emotion, but there is one thing that is different about this album, the songs just plain aren't good. I've tried to let it grow on me, but its not happening. Maybe Jack has lost his spark. This album is definately not worth your money."
1,Lost inTranslation,"It would have been good if the item was delivered.Too difficult to follow Amazon up, no further purchases to be made."
4,Great Album - Not the Best,"I am a huge White Stripes fan and so glad they came out with another album (with rumours of their splitting, etc.). Anyway, this is a different sounding album - there are less guitars, more pounding pianos...a really different sound. If you are a fan of only their released singles then this may not be the album for you but if you are a full White Stripes fan then I think it is still a great album. Very interesting indeed."
5,My old memory of Thin Lizzy,"About eight years ago, when my first baby was only one month old, I recorded a program which the hostess introduced Thin Lizzy's first three albums. I kept going to Tower Records to look for them, but I didn't find them. Now it's great that I'll have a chance to see them and share my ideas and feeling, I really love all the songs."
3,Definetely the best of Thin Lizzy's first period,"This is the second album of Thin Lizzy and the best among the three albums that Lizzy recorded as a trio. Maturity is probably the main reason for that fact while Lynott becomes even more capable of balancing between hard rock and folk. In this way , ""Brought Down"" and ""Call the police"" are among the finest examples of melodic and classic hard rock , while ballads such as ""Sarah"" , ""Shades of..."" can proove just how talented Phil Lynott was. I recommend this album since it is probably the most interesting LP of the E.Bell era."
4,SO far ok,"I like them. I dont think I will be able to run in them since they are nylon, that would chafe my legs. Good for kicking around in though."
5,Magic meeting of two generations,"You can certainly be forgiven for not expecting much of this collaboration between the Hamlet-like founding Byrd member and the smart Texas cowpunk/new wave chick. But have faith and buy!Gene Clark and Carla Olson put together a fine dozen songs consisting of a few by each of them and wonderful selections from other writers (Gram Parsons' ""Hot Burrito No.1"", John Fogerty's ""Almost Saturday Night,"" Joe South's ""Don't It Make You Wanta Go Home"" and Woody Guthrie's forever relevant ""Deportee""). Their two voices mix wonderfully, Clark's soulful world-weary plaint and Olson's throaty contralto complementing each other. The instrumentation is a scintillating all-acoustic platform that makes me wish more people made records without amplifiers. This album will never date.The only complaint for this release is a greedy one: I wish they had done more than twelve tracks."
3,Needs more details,"it was a rather hard read and need more details, but a OK read on Jim Bridger. Would like to have detais on Morman fights ect."
3,Java Script Professional,Good book but was disappointed because it did not provide more details and examples of using CGI/Perl with Java Script. Seemed to be promoting the sale of ScriptEase Software.
4,Sudoku,I bought this for my husband who won't go near a computer. I was very surprised when he actually started playing the Sudoku. It is a hit with him.
3,The War and Peace of JAVA programming,"I think I would have liked this book a lot better if they removed all instances of Ivor Hortens mug from the covers. Ivor, this is for you:System.out.println('remove ivors mug');"
4,Random and wordy,"This guy rambles too much. It's almost like he took a college lecture and dictated it for the book. His almost every thought is included in written form. Lucky us! ;-)For a faster, more direct intro to the language, I highly recommend Java 2: A Beginner's Guide by Schildt. It's much more concise, ordered, and clear.Horton jumps around too much. He touches on a subject and then tells the read ""but we'll be covering that in a few more chapters."" Then why bring it up? There are items like this throughout that really break up the flow.Despite my dislike of straight readability of this book, it will sit on my shelf as a decent reference."
1,Typical grab your money and run book,The book is confusing to read. And it misses so many important and basic topics (I found this out when I was preparing for the Sun Certified Java Programmer exam and reading other books).It's a typical bad book written by Unix-or-mainframe-C++-programmer-turn-to-Java-author. It explains a lot of general programming but is weak on Java-specific topics. Those dull examples and failure to show us what are important and what are not in practice are the result of author's lackness in extensive REAL world Java programming experience.
1,"Sophies World: Decent book, Long Read",Writing about historical philosophy can be extremely monotonous. The never ending details of each philosopher and their accomplishments find a way to all sound the same. Jostien Gaarder tried to take a different approach on this subject matter. He tried intertwining historical philosophy with an intriguing novel. This resulted in 500 pages of never ending details and subject matter that was presented the same way every chapter. The plot became extremely confusing and difficult to follow and at the same time there were so many philosophers to think about. Jostein's attempt was an unsuccessful scattered 500 page mix of history text book and story.
1,Misleading and sends wrong message to kids.,"I think this book is not good. Evidently, the author does not live in the 21st century or has never known a 14 year old girl. He makes this girl invite someone who she doesn't even know to her house. And she tells him when her mom will not be home. I mean, this guy could have been some weirdo and could have done anything to her. And who doesn't know that a mirror is just a piece of glass? Please... I thought she was seven. And the little messenger... OF COURSE IT WAS A DOG!!!What moron can't figure that out. I knew it the first time she received a wet letter with holes. Gosh! This author needs to get a clue. I'm very upset that this book is being assigned in school and giving out the message to kids to invite strangers over and trust people you don't know. This book is not good enough to be considered a novel."
4,Wonderful....,"To anyone who reads this book- Prepared to be confused, changed, and dumbfounded.This book is both strange- you don't read too many books where the main character ends up reading the book- and will make you do strange things- I actually cleaned up my room because of this book.The abrut changes (I will say no more about them now, so as not to spoil the book) halfway through the books serve to emphasize the nature of the book, and make the reader doubt their own existance- are we but shadows on a cave wall?Ah yes, a reponse to an earlier reviewer's remark- that the characters are flat? Remember, a great deal of the book reads like an (interesting) textbook. Sophie needs to be a bit flat, so she can ask the questions to help the reader understand what is being said."
2,You either HATE it or you LOVE it,"Assigned this novel for my Philosophy class, I hardly felt it was a novel. It was a history book thinly disguised as a piece of fiction. I admit it is a great resource for students, but not very comprehensive, and the writing seems as though it is geared toward young fantasy-ridden girls. Worth the time if you need a quick resource for a philosphy paper, but not if you are looking for good reading."
5,Great,"This book was really great. It made you think of things that you would normally never think of. Although some of the histories of philosophy could get a little boring, other more interesting parts make up for them."
5,Alice In Wonderland meets Philosophy,"This book will make you laugh. This book will make you think. Sophie's World is a philosophy text wrapped in a fictional story. The further you get into the book, the farther down the rabbithole you've travelled. Once you've read it and discovered the surprise ending, you'll have to read it again in a new light."
3,Story Around Philosophy Simple: Philosophy Interesting,"The fat (fictional story) around the muscle (philosophy) is slightly immature and simplistic, but the philosophical references encourage further learning. To this end, I think the book is a success: the book entices new readers of philosophy making them ask ""why"", wonder about systems of thought, consider perspectives on religion, ethnocentrism and worldly endeavours. In such a materialistic, impatient and superficial North American culture, it's refreshing to read a book that comments on intensely important and meaningful questions about our existence."
1,My Entire Book Club HATED it,"We read Sophie's World for my book club. Our group consists of three English teachers, two science teachers, a history teacher, a philosophy major, and an RN. We are not ""fluff"" readers, so we expected to enjoy this novel about philosophy. Boy, were we wrong!None of us liked it. It read like an introduction to philosophy textbook with unbelievable characters. Most of us teach middle school and none of us believed Sophie's incredible interest in philosophy, her amazing knack at grasping such ephemeral concepts so quickly, nor her close relationship to her ""mentor.""The idea of the outlying story was interesting, but poorly written. Both the imaginary and ""real"" worlds in Sophie's World were so flat and unrealistic that it was impossible to reach the suspension of disbelief necessary to become engaged in the text. I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason."
1,From the View of Someone Reading This For Highschool,"This book is one of the most boaring books i have read in my entire life. While many kids in highschool loathe reading, i happen to be one of the few who enjoy reading on my spare time. This book made me want to die. While i do belive philosophy is intresting, thought provoking, and entertaining, this book made me want to fall alseep. I love the ideas of these thinkers, but the way it's presented is just..boaring. I often had to read pages over and over again, because i could not grasp the concept. Not because it was too difficult, but because i found my mind wandering off onto other subjects."
3,Nice but overated,"ok,say you want to teach your or another child about philosophy, is this the book to use? Yes and no. Yes it can be good to use, but not alone, you must use other books too, because muchinfo the author presents is biased. Really book is not so well writen like some reviewers here would like you to think, but still it is nice and worth the while."
4,"I liked the book in general, but many parts could be changed","I had to read this book for my 10th grade AP European class. Overall, I thought it was pretty (some parts were rather interesting), but things need fixing. Personally, I didn't like the fact that it became a book inside a book (fellow readers, you know what I mean). I wish Sophie and Alberto continued to exist in reality, like the rest of us. The Disney figures along with the fairy tale figures were pretty lame too. But as I said, an overall good book."
2,One of the most deadly dull books ever,"I loved The Solitaire Mystery, But I found Sophie's World extremely boring. EXTREMELY boring. However, I might decide to give it another go after reading all the good comments here."
4,Great introduction to philosophy but falls apart at the end.,"I loved the first half of this book. It was a great introduction to the great philosophers of history. I even found the fictitious story of Sophie, Alberto and Hilde enchanting. But two-thirds of the way through, the story lost momentum and became silly. Worth reading for the philosophy, but not as a novel."
4,Delightful,"It is an extremely wonderful story that will captivate you. A little bizarre for a while, but for understandable reasons that can only be discovered by finishing the whole book.A great introductoy book into the world of philosophy. It gives an overview of most of the worlds famous philosophers which I found to be educational."
2,Good for a reference book Bad for a read,"This book could and should have been replaced by a collection of philisophical essays on the given topics. The storyline that held it together was weak at best, The characters generic or stupid. The Philisophical insights provided by sopie made her out to be a ditz, and Alberto a wierd old man. Don't read this book if you expect a well written story that ties in philisophical study with an engaging story. Only read this book if you enjoy the incoherent ramblings of an old norweigen high school teacher, I sure didn't"
4,Excellent History of Philosophy,"Truly an excellent and engaging history of philosophy written so as to avoid ""dry textbook syndrome."" The novel part turns a bit weird toward the end and the treatment of the earlier philosophers is better than the more recent philosophers but, overall, the author does an outstanding job of teaching a beginning history of philosophy course in a highly enjoyable format."
3,Interesting read but I'm surprised it's one of the fan favorites,"Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is a summarized history of philosophy disguised as a novel, and the disguise isn't very compelling. If sitting in on a philosophy 101 lecture sounds like a good time, then this is the book for you because 90% of the novel is more or less that - a mysterious teacher recapping 2,500 years of philosphy to an eager young learner, Sophie Amundsen.There's a clever narrative holding the novel together that twists your imagination, but there's too little of it. Meanwhile, there's too much slogging through the historical impacts of one philospher after another.I enjoyed another one of his novels, The Solitaire Mystery, and I am suprised this one was more inaccessable for me since it's his most popular work."
1,sloppy account on philosophy,"An attempt to make philosophy entertaining for the general public is a nice idea but the story contained in this work is weak. I kept reading only to finsh the book and found the end most disappointing. Read a philosophy text it might take just as much effort to read, but you'll find it more rewarding."
1,This is a book not intended for readers.,"This is an incredibly boring history of philosophy that won't even stick with you ten minutes after you read it. The author puts this behind a weak novel. Maybe if it was half novel and half philsophy, the book would have more impact on readers, but ten to fifteen pages of the incredibly boring history of philosophers and then two to three pages of novel is unacceptable. The only people who I would recommend this to are masochists and sadistic English teachers (can we say Mrs. Quinn?) Basically, this is an uninteresting and stupid novel that was not meant to be read."
4,Disturbing undertones of paedophilia,"Yes, it is supremely original. Yes, it is a brilliant philosophical primer. And yes, the chapter on Darwin is the best short summary (rather than simplification, which is more usual) of evolution theory that I have ever read. But I couldn't help feeling that there are strong undertones of paedophilia in the surface story, about an older man sending billets-doux to a young girl, enticing her into his strange world, and even dressing up for her! Don't try this at home."
2,acceptable,"This book has a grade-school level plot, but it presents philosophical ideas at the high-school level. I would rather read a straight-up history of philosophy and skip the fantasy crap. A sixth-grader would probably love the plot but have trouble understanding the complex ideas."
3,The book is dense,"Sophie's World is definately an interesting read. But if you are persistent enough to plough through the pages and pages of philosophical notes, you will be doing well.The book is, to be frank, extremely difficult to read. Jostein Gaarder is trying to explain the complex history of philosophy and philosophical ideas, which is difficult to grasp in small portions, but almost impossible after 400 odd pages.Finally, i would say that Sophie's World needs to be read to be judged. I am sure that the ideas it contains would be appealing and stimulating to many individuals, but for those of us who enjoy a comfortable and easy afternoon read, i would not recommend it. Dense is a very appropriate word to describe this book."
1,Simplistic and unabashedly Eurocentric,"A world history of philosophy that totally disregards any philosopher with no Graeco- Roman- White- European background? Hardly very convincing, but unfortunately not the only let-down about this neither particularly well-written nor interesting novel, that to me more closely resembles the outcome of an amateur philosophy / novel writing weekend workshop than a book with bestseller potential. A waste of time and money."
1,Highly boring,I'm interested in philosophy so i thought I might enjoy this book. But it got very boring after a while. It's presented in a very boring fashion.
2,"Might as well be a textbook, horrible novel","This is the choppiest novel I have ever read! While I do have to give credit to the fact that I learned much about philosophy, this book might as well had been a textbook. The plot was not well thought out and very engaging. Plus, Alberto's painfully long lectures would awkwardly be interrupted by Sophie, with her ""I get it now's"" or ""I see"". I don't understand how this book made the bestseller list. I think this book probably has some merit, but it got ""lost in translation"" from it's original. I had read somewhere that many changes were made in the book that was sold in the U.S. market. All in all, though, this is not a book that I will ever recommend!"
3,more engaging than the average textbook; weaker as a novel,"Billed as a novel, this book is much more didactic than I had expected. The first third or so moves slowly, with little story stringing the philosophy lessons together. The book improves as a mystery unfolds. The mystery is solved long before the end of the book, however, after which the story becomes more and more absurd."
2,Can't decide whether or not I'll finish it...,"This might be good for someone who has had no exposure at all to philosophy, in which case the ideas would seem new and exciting. Otherwise, Alberto's lectures are too basic.I'm about two/thirds through it, and I'm getting fed up with Sophie's constant sarcastic interjections during her lessons. Plus, Sophie not only immediately grasps completely new concepts, but she astutely compares one philosopher's reasoning to another's, while accurately honing in on weaknesses in their arguments -- I can't imagine a 15-year old like this.I'll probably just skim the rest of it -- I want to find out how everything goes with my favorite character, Hermes."
4,instructive,"Sophies world was very educating for me, especially the capitel about Freud and Darwin. I used this book for learning english, and therefore i read it four times (with every new turn, I learned more vocabularies and a better understanding of the plot and the philosophers) So I snatched two flies at the same time."
5,Remarkably original and thought-provoking,"""Sophie's World"" is exceptional. It offers a detailed overview of the history of philosophy as well as a delightfully innocent and intriguing mystery. Very informative and eminemtly enjoyable."
3,"brilliant concept, less-than-perfect execution","Sophie's World is really a (deep) thinking person's book. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is really a Philosophy 101 textbook wrapped into a novel. Not surprisingly it bites off more than it can chew; there is simply too much philosophical discussion to simply read through as a novel. At times it becomes a very slow, torturous read.But it almost works. After about half way through Sophie's World becomes more a novel, and the ending is rather clever (perhaps too clever for some).Overall I'm glad I read it, but it would be hard to recommend."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book (almost) because I was genuinely interested in researching some philosophy from a standing start. A novel seemed like a good place to start. I've started to read it 5 or 6 times, but still not managed to finish it.I have to say I found it too slow and predictable. There is very little to disguise the fact that it is a series of history of philosophy essays. No subtley in the anonymous letters metaphor. No characters or narrative to capture the imagination.By contract Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is an evocative roller-coaster ride, that nevertheless exposes important themes of philosophy. No contest."
5,The Last of the 'CLASSIC SEVEN',"I agree that this is a great album...not my favorite of the original 7, but still better than most albums released at that time ..or since then for that matter. To answer a question about the price...I believe this is the re-master...the Moodies actually went back into the studio a couple years ago and redid Isnt Life Strange with an orchestra the way John Lodge originally had conveived it. As for sales of this album...It went triple platinum at the time, was No. 1 for about 5 weeks and was their biggest selling album at the time...Days of Future Passed was number 3 the same time this was no. 1, due to the re-release of Nights in White Satin. The orignal album is still available on cd for 11.98."
4,Zodiac Mindwarp returns in force,"If you are like me and were just blown away by their debut album, entranced by the much-needed sexist escape they provided, then you will not be disappointed with this, their long overdue return to form. It plays like it could be their 2nd album.The sound -far from being overpolished--is actually more raw than 'Messiah'. It is a wonderful disc, full of Zodiac's creative genius and trademark chauvenism. The heavy guitars of Cobalt Stargazer are again the perfect soundtrack for Zody's astral spewings about life on planet Earth. Don't miss this one. Crank it."
5,"Excellent, But Where is Grey","This is a great compilation, but where the hell is Grey, one of they're best songs?!! I am very surprised this was not on here. 4.5 stars"
4,great for a knitter,"I've had my eye on this book for some time and was thrilled when I bought it.Some of the patterns are relatively basic, but still interesting. The legwarmers are great for someone who wants to try tatting but doesn't want to commit to a large lace project. The petal bib is absolutely adorable and is what told me I had to get this book. And the labyrinth circle rug is gorgeous.I only give the book 4 out of 5 because the title is a bit misleading when it says ""project to knit & crochet."" There are a lot of knitting patterns and only a few for crochet."
4,Quick Chic Knits from One Skein. Great for making gifts.,"Well-written & stylish. This is the best of the ""One Skein"" type books. Good for beginners and making quick gifts. Beautifully photographed chic patterns with concise instructions. The author stretches a bit, i.e. using one skein with 1250 yards for a shell top, but that's probably why this book has more varied projects than the others. There is a short techniques section in the back, which I always find helpful for reference."
3,Misleading title - the book is 90% knitting,"If you crochet and don't knit, you'll probably want to skip this book, because it's very focused on knitting. The only crochet patterns are the following: Cap & Ruffle Cravat set, Geometric Accessory Bags (very basic - round, square, and rectangle), Bath Mit (Tunisian crochet), and Bath Mat. All the other patterns are for knitters."
3,One Skein: 30 Quick Projects to Knit or Crochet,Well...I thought this would be a great book...which it is if you are a knitter...the ratio is about 3 to 1 knitting patterns to crocheting patterns. I don't know how to knit...I crochet. Great ideas though just wish it was even in the distribution.
5,Great gift ideas!,"This book has all kinds of nifty gift ideas for you to knit up in no time at all. It's also got some great patterns to use up that scrap yarn on, which I thought was handy. I'm never sure what to do with them and I always have a pile of scrap yarn. This is one that'll be in my collection for years to come."
3,Not much for crocheters,"Despite claiming 30 quick projects to knit AND crochet, the book is almost entirely knitting patterns. There's plenty of cute-looking projects for the knitters, but they're not much use to me. Glad I got this from the library first."
5,"Fast, Easy Read. Hard to put down","I found this book to be as compelling as the first book of the series. Maybe I had been away from Foster's books for awhile so I was not so jaded, but I found the pace of the book and the story to very well done.If you are into a little bit different type of story (i.e. The Spellsinger Series) I think you will find this series enjoyable."
2,A stark disappointment,"I had quite enjoyed the first book. The lead character reminded me of Foster's ""Into the Out Of"", a book a highly recommend, but skip the last 50 pages or so. Alas! this one didn't measure up. Meandering and moralistic, with too many cardboard Bad Guys and the escape from tight spots and dire straits have become predictable in that Ehomba will pull something unpredictable from his rucksack."
2,Way Too Small; Zipper Not Well Located; Poor Construction,"You'd think theses accessory companies would spend ten minutes actually using their own products but N-O-O-O!!!The zipper is located directly under the bike seat, so you can't actually zip the item up without extreme distress.I have already broken my zipper because of the complaint above and also because the unit is so tiny. Warning: most of these bike bags are about 1/2 the size they need to be to carry even a jacket and basic accessories.Strangely, like most bags, this one is also slightly too wide at its mounting point near the bike stem, s your legs are always rubbing against it.Looks like they invented this over the phone, without speaking the same langhuage, and certainly without ever using it."
5,great pepper sauce,"I tried Trappey' Red Devil sauce several years ago and it is by far my favorite. It isn't very hot but it has a ton of flavor. I use it on eggs, sandwiches, popcorn, you name it. It's a great product and I suggest trying it."
1,NOT WHAT WE RECEIVED,"I ordered this item and it was around $17.00 or so. What I received was this little tiny with a very tiny square and mini accessories as it looks...not what I ordered. Contacted Amazon and they refunded my purchase price right away, but stated they could not reship it and that I would need to replace a new order. Well, upon returning to this item it had increased to $29.99! I contacted Amazon again and they said they would give me free 1 day shipping. It is really the point of the matter. Not ordering it again. Not worth the headache!"
5,Astonishing Unheard Psychedelic Rock Album,"It's fantastic. This Can, with Malcolm Mooney singing, was a different Can than the one later with Damo Suzuki singing. The rhythms here are straighter rock, albeit tied to African forms.Influences are discernable - The Velvet Underground, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, and African forms. The instrumental players don't have their wings spread as widely as on subsequent releases, but nevertheless play extremely well. Singer Malcolm Mooney will impress some with his genius and annoy others by sounding so close to the nervous breakdown he indeed soon had.Bottom line the record is tremendous and everyone should hear it."
4,Classic,"I bought the LP in 1965. Still have it, but no phono. I bought the CD and can enjoy it once again."
4,Functional fin comb,"I wanted an inexpensive comb for home and decided to give this a try. This comb does the job well enough once I figured out the best way to use it. Rather than slowly trying to slip it between good fins, I ended up just raking it quickly across the fins and that worked well for me. The comb did it's job and straightened the crushed fins I was working on. I wouldn't call this a professional tool but for the home it works just fine."
4,"A bit small, but nice","Overall a nice piece of equipment. I maybe should have bought the medium, but I was able to get two compressed air cartridges, a multi tool, a couple of patch kits, and tire levers inside. I wish I had room for a mountain bike tube but it was full already. I do like the compact size under my seat for short rides and I will just have to put a tube in my hydration pack for longer rides."
3,Amen Corner Critical Review,"The main characters are Sister Boxer, Brother Boxer, Sister Jackson, Sister Moore, Odessa, Margaret, Luke, and David. What I really liked about the play was the dialect. The wording really did fit in very good. It was also a very down to earth play. Some of the problems that the main characters faced were every day problems, for instance, David (Margaret's boy) came home drunk when he was so into church (at least that is what his mom thought), and Margaret is a holy person and her husband is a very non believer of the such. Luke was just a person who simply did what made him feel comfortable. All in all, it was a good play and it kept my attention at all times. there were a few things that I didn't like but I will just keep my personal opinions to myself."
3,Authentic but on the dark side; not easy listening,"My acquaintance with Tanzanian music comes from two years' residence near a village on the outskirts of Dar-es-Salaam 20 years ago. The drums beat all night long on many nights, and the women chanted and trilled. This CD sounds reasonably authentic but not the upbeat, vibrant sound I heard most often. This CD sounds like devil music, but lacks the strong repetitive power of many chants I have heard. As the title indicates: bad witchcraft. This CD is definitely the dark side of Africa--a side I never really experienced in two years of speaking Swahili every day."
5,A Ferverish and Funny Psychological journey,"Everett Carson is the dysfunctional main character. His Psychological journey from orphaned child to mentally ill adult is wrought with heartbreak and humor. The descriptions and details of his mental illness are more authentic and creative then ""A Beautiful Mind"". (You will never forget ""The Wedge"")If you happen to be from Oregon you will find the historic backdrop to be fascinating. D.H. Burns first novel is as poetic and soul stirring as one could ever hope for me in a good read. I can't wait for the movie!"
5,Wonderful.,"Awesome. Very useful. Starts with some helpful warm ups and stretching. From basic pop slap octaves, he incorporates some really cool sounding ideas. Great way to get comfy with ghosts, mutes, arpeggios, soloing. Worthwhile to buy because you should stop and play along with it. Listening to it over and over allows you to learn by ear. It takes awhile to absorb all of it. Best to focus on a few minutes at a time, master that, and then move on. He combines groups of tips into examples at the end of each section. Not for beginners, tho! If you've been playing awhile and need to break out of a rut with some fresh, new riffs then this is for you. Abandon the pick, this video will help you develop your right hand. More bass players out there should stop and take the time to learn from videos like this. The music world would be a much richer place."
4,Not for the short of patience,"The graphics are impressive and the game is challenging. Like the other review said, though, this is not a game that can be played in one sitting. (Unless you plan sitting for, oh, 12 hours maybe.) I have two gripes: the annoying quotes from non-existent books, and sometimes my people won't go where I tell them to go."
4,Worth Buying,I have been using thi book for last two weeks and I really feel like telling people who wish to expand on ASP to buy this book
2,Too early to buy this book,How many of us has already installed Win2000 server and started doing some serious stuff. This book contains huge amount of info that can mostly be done only on the Win2000 server. But the book is good for knowing different kinds of technologies that go with ASP. Not recommended for beginners/midlevel
3,"Good for reference, not for studying.","This book covers most of topic you may need. So, you can use it as a reference on ASP3. But it is not for beginner or for studying from a ground. It is quite hard-to-read, not explained in-depth, and it made me quite ???."
4,Best New Play,"This play won the 2004 Helen Hayes Award for Best New Play.It has twelve characters (4 women & 8 men, with 5 men doubling also as a minor character).""Shakespeare in Hollywood will charm your socks off. It left me smiling . . . all the way home to New York."" - Terry Teachout, The Wall Street Journal""So deliciously inventive, you'd swear that Ludwig and the Bard were in cahoots. At once poignant and funny, literary and farcical, sophisticated and silly, political and fanciful, high-brow and low-brow . . . a delight!""- J. Wynn Rousuck, The Baltimore Sun"
5,Three more Fairfax High tracks,"appear on this single. Though the song ""Bad Photographer"" itself is weak, the non-LP tracks make it worth its weight in gold. Two of Saint Etienne's best 60s inspired songs EVER, Hit The Brakes and Swim Swam Swim appear here, as well as an acoustic sweetie named Madeleine. Well worth the money."
4,good purchase,"As always............there are a few great songs you wanted to be on a ""Best of"" or ""Greatest Hits"" CD and they aren't there but this is a good CD"
3,I doubt it,"All Hank Williams songs are good, but I do not think this selection covers the best. I would call it ""The 20 Greatest Hits and Some Filler."""
2,Not Bratty Enough,"I was surprised. ""The Big Bratty Book of Bart Simpson"" wasn't bratty enough. Or funny enough. In fact it was not even 'okay' and didn't generate one hearty guffaw from me.What I was expecting was either juvenile humor -- you know, potty humor or 'gross stuff' jokes -- or edgy humor, but what I found were some very old and dusty 'jokes' that were being recast as Simpson's humor, as well as some material that could only be classified as filler.The art is good, and what you would expect if you merged The Simpsons of television fame with an old style comic book. But you can hardly expect it to carry a whole book.My 10 year-old daughter, by the way, found the book more a curiosity than humorous, and her 8 year-old brother actually skimmed most of it -- something he would never do with Captain Underpants.If I was to try to estimate who the best audience would be for this book, I'd say it's likely to appeal to younger Middle-grade boys.Pam T~mom/blogger of #kidlit"
3,Moves to slow,"This book is for someone who is not technically inclined, not just new to Flash MX. It moves so slow that it is hard to get into the book."
3,Not so balanced,"This book is decent, but could use a little improving. It's assumed that you have the software to work with as you read so for students, this might be an issue. It's a great beginner book, but I found myself getting confused because there were steps missing, or assumed, and not enough detail given for a person to complete some of the tasks. In other areas, the book over explained simple things. Blah Blah Blah!"
3,for the true novice.,"This book could be re-titled Flash for Morons. It assumes you're not merely new to Flash, but that you have absolutely no technical experience, and very little technical aptitude.I'm not panning the book because this approach is ideal for the introductory pages, the first several chapters. The fundamentals of Flash are indeed presented very well.About halfway through the book, however, the approach becomes annoying. It is one thing to assume the reader has no idea what the heck is going on at the beginning of the book. It is another to assume the reader still has no idea what's going on halfway through it."
3,Buy Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0 Instead,This book should be replaced with Beginning Active Server Pages 3.0 which would receive 5 stars from me. ASP 2.0 is old news now.
4,Great Book for Beginners,"I had worked with IIS before using MS Access and the ""Save As HTML"" component of Access. While this did a good enough job, this book taught me exactly how to make my own database connections and how to set up the queries I needed. Very well written, except for quite a few typos I found. They would name the variables one thing then on the next page, it would be named something else (although if you read carefully, you'll figure out most of the errors on your own).It's so easy to program ASP - it's as easy as the old GWBasic that used to come with DOS in the early '90s.I highly recommend this if you choose to go the ASP route over Perl, Python, etc..."
5,The book is way too cool!!!,This book is just too great and takes you to the actual learning so smoothly and quickly that you hardly realize that you are in the middle of the astounding technology of ASP-the most revered techstuff ever to happen on the web.Its a damn good book. I am told the Professional Active Server Pages 2.0 by the same authors and publisher is also good but since did not know too much about scripting and ASP tried this out first . Its really great. Too much cool stuff!
4,This book is a great start for a novice,"I was given the job to integrate an Access DB into our corporate web site. With only basic knowledge of HTML, I bought the Professional ASP and found it to be a little over my head. This book is great for a beginner like me wishing to integrate a database with the web. I could only recommned adding a little more info on the syntax of adding SQL into an asp. I found it diffucult to get it to work sometimes. However, with a little effort, everything worked out and I still HIGHLY recommend this book over anything else."
4,"Good, but sometimes the explanation is too much.","Surely, this is a good book for the beginners of the Internet Programming. An average experienced non-internet programmer could finish reading this book 16-24 hours. The real stuff starts from 8 chapter on wards and lost chapter should help everyone( I yet to finish this chapter.)"
3,Git for a friend,I got these as a gift for a friend but I haven't talked to him in a long time. He seemed to like them though.
3,Not a good book to learn the C#,"It is very discouraging to read a programming book when after reading several chapters (7 chapters), you felt like you have not learned anything or you cannot apply what you read from the previous chapters. As one of the reviewers said, the chapters are not progressive in terms of building your skills. The book could be a good reference but of course, you can always get it for free and can better explain a topic.I really like the books from Wrox but book like this is degrading the excellent and quality reputation of Wrox books.Beginners beware......."
2,Should be Beginning C# not Professional C#.,"Buy this book if you want something that introduces you to a lot of what C# and .NET is all about: Console C#, Visual C#, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, XML, and so forth.Don't buy it if you expect it to go into significant detail in these areas. You get a broad tour; there's a gaping hole in some of the coverage, ESPECIALLY in the Visual C# area.C#/.NET has so many concepts to it, it'll take more than 1 book. So don't buy books that try to cover it all. Buy a C# beginners book, then buy the book that covers what specialty you need (ie, ASP.NET and C#, Visual C# Applications, etc. )In short: Good for an introduction; bad for any serious development. (not good as a reference either)"
2,Can I return my copy?,"I was actually looking for Yo Yo Ma's cd of tango music and came across this instead. On a whim, I thought I'd check it out.Tango music is lush, passionate and rich in its textures. This cd consists of piano, accordian and violin. It doesnt have the passion of Astor Piazzola (sp?) or other fully orchestrated arrangements. I would reccommend seeing Forever Tango when it comes to your town and picking up a copy of the soundtrack.Don't get me wrong, the music is fine. It just doesn't seem to have the fire of other cds I've been listening to."
3,Sentimental journey hits brick wall,"I don't know what's worse-that I liked this album when it first came out, or that I purchased it a second time. I'm sentimental & listening to albums like this takes me back to that time when I was in my mid-teens. It flashes me back to playing badmitton in the side yard at Sleepy Hollow Trailer Court in Hollywood, MD. Into the present, its value beyond that is comical if nothing else. It is very dated, but then again, so am I. Time has not shone well on BTO."
4,Solid overview on kilnforming,"I've got both this and the previous edition of Cumming's book in my collection. The author has plenty of hands-on experience and a broad knowledge of many glass techniques and processes. I wouldn't call this a hands-on, step-by-step tutorial in studio technique but it will certainly get you started."
2,Great idea but bag ripped on first use at the airport.,"I chose this because we travel at least once a year to Grammy's. The bag ripped while we were putting the car seat into the bag. We have a Britax Marathon. I really didn't want a backpack, because it's really just a cover so we could check the carseat as baggage."
3,not a duet,Fetiche is a Peruvian songstres and although she is from Peru-Tania Libertad is in effect a Mexican recording star. There are no duets but in this 2cd compilation half the songs are from each performers recordings. Libertad has many solo albums available and Fetiche fans can search for her albums.
3,Hearing Gets in the Way of Romance,"This book contains a wonderful little romance if one could just get past the long, drawn out hearing centered around a university professor. Gilbert, the college professor, is keeping a very important secret from Rachel James, one of his favorite former students. It was more than obvious how much Gilbert and his students cared for one another, but the reader was beat over the head with that point far too often.Rachel, along with his other former students, come to the aid of their much beloved mentor who holds a well guarded secret. During this time, she happens to fall for the reporter covering the story. Another problem with the story is: most readers probably will have figured out that secret without having even gotten far into the novel.If only the author had focused on this story rather than that of hearing, this could have been one nice little romance novel."
4,Cute tale of interracial love...,"Ian Beck is looking for a story while Rachel James is trying to find her past. They come together when Rachel's mentor is charged with helping his students out a little too much and Ian is the one reporting the story for his paper. Rachel always had to deal with being different, being biracial, and always had to deal with losing those she loves. But meeting Ian will finally help break down her walls and bring her past to the present.I liked the book. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer. Yet, I thought the book had good characterization for just a short novel. I would recommend it."
5,Rock/R&B/Rap/Soul/Blues -- All in one?,"This guy is very talented. I really like how he integrates soul with blues with rap, etc. I initially bought the album for White Trash and Blinded, but quickly found out the rest of the songs are also extremely good. One major criteria that I have for a really good album is how often it goes in the CD player. This one goes in a lot! I didn't even think that I would ever listen to Rap."
2,SACD Stereo Only,"This is a fantastic set of music from Everlast. However, it is not multichannel SACD, but Stereo SACD. I am disappointed, and hope I keep someone else from the same."
1,What the hell happened to Everlast?,"My title explains it all. This album sucks. Don't get me wrong, I know almost all of my reviews are about hiphop albums, preferably underground, so many may think I'm against to his new sounds because I'm a hip hop fan. Not true. When he came with Whit E Ford sings the blues, I loved it. He had a few non hip hop that were nice, including What it's like, which was a great song. That kind of diversity is nice, kind of like Mos Def and K-Os do on their albums. This one, it's like he's trying to throw away that great mc that made him a legend. There are very few hip hop tracks on here, if those are even called that, and he doesn't even play any rock. All attempts at playing the blues, which he did alright, but he's no BB King. After his first solo album, it kind of went downhill and this was no exception. Don't waste your money."
4,greatest white rapper???,"I'm confused, this is more like country. the guy's got a nice voice but he's not a rapper. which in his case, is probably a good thing. I think he has some nice songs worth listening to! very unique style, just definitely not rap. nothing like it."
1,More a 'Confuser' than Thriller,I persevered to the end of the movie and feel I should be given some kind of award. Whatever the director (and scriptwriter) was thinking does not translate into rewarding viewing.The script had a number of (what could have been) interesting characters and ideas but too many to develop properly. With the exception of Derek Jacobi everyone else was just going through the motions. Perhaps they were as confused as I was.I was left feeling that it would have been better done as one of those British detective series full of whimsy and eccentric characters. The `secret' could then have continued to be the macguffin without the need for complex historical flashback explanations.My advice: Don't buy it.
2,Good Content and Bad Support,"I Don't know if any of the reviewers have read all the book and have tried the source code , because I have done so and I have found lot of errors in the Builder program source code and also in the Authentication process they have described and all the problems I faced I have reported to the Author Matthew Reynolds at his email address mentioned in the book but no reply so I have resent it to him a second and a third time but also no reply so I sent it to Support at WROX but also no reply .Now I have corrected all the errors and I have rewritten all the missing procedures and I don't need any help from them , but I don't know if they can continue wroking in this way .I gave the book 4 stars for the content and 0 stars for the suuport so overall 2 stars ."
2,Disappointed...,"I was looking for a book that really discussed enterprise design with .NET, and did not get it.The book was too low level, and spent too much time describing the author's data class creation tool, with very little actual discussion of design related topics."
2,"for idiots, by idiots","... [bad] maps and instructions. Stupid jokes in place of much-needed information. Lacking coverage on all too many places. And worst, advertisement for every other book in the series at the opening of the section on each country.... .Stick to Lonely Planet. Far, far better than this junk."
1,I almost cried!!!,"I own the one shot in Radio City and I love it, the kids that I baby-sit throw it in the vcr and dance away with it. It is an amazing show. I recently bought this version and it's atrocious!!! Everything is in red, the dancing is sloppy,the extra scenes are not worth having, and there's fog. This show used to be ""classy"" I guess you could say, and that was what set it apart from showier shows like the one (because they are all the same with a few added numbers and new costumes)Micheal Flatley runs. Like the other viewer said...Moya Dougherty said that there was a fine line that they couldn't cross, and it has definately been crossed. If you like Michael Flatley's show then you'll like this, maybe. If you liked the other Riverdance...save your money."
3,Alright book,Lots of information still valid but book is a bit out dated and even refers to a lot of material for download that is not even available no more.
3,Fast shipping but product ok,Product makes your skin smooth - I put it on when I showered - than rinsed even though it tells you not to. But for rosacea - didn't work at all.
2,One of the worst available,"I bought a Jabra for my Nokia 6160, and found it to be unusable. I couldn't hear anything, and my callers could barely hear me. I replaced the Jabra with a Plantronics headset and that worked much better. For my recently purchased Ericsson, I bought the factory earpiece and that works better than the Jabra, as well.In my experience, headsets that have a separate mike and speaker work much better than a one-piece unit such as the Jabra."
3,Silly and Fun,"This is an early entry in the Robert Fripp discography, and not one I would entirely dismiss. The album title about sums it all up, but there is some very respectable playing and amusing and catchy Beatlesque (the default for 1967) tunesmithing. One baroque-inspired guitar piece foreshadows Fripp's later - and much harder edged - FRACTURE. There are also some other early prog elements here wedged in between the pop songs."
5,"great lessons... sytematic, clear.",Excellent lessons... just perfect... sssshhh.. I'll let you in on a little secret... you listening? Give Apple 99 bucks and get 50 one hour lessons! 2 bucks an hour with a pro at the Apple store!
3,boring,"I used this book to fulfill my random GE, it was such a dull class and reading was so painful. Honestly, I was never interested in the subject so you don't have to take my word for it."
2,Dissapointing early feature by Tsui,"An early film by Tsui Hark; certainly not one of its best. Compared with his later works, this film is pretty primitive and the ""special effects"" are almost laughable in its crudeness. Best part of the film is Brigitte Lin's brief role as the ""ice maiden"""
4,corny and great all in one,"I would say this film is about the corniest movie I have every seen, but I really like it. Take it for what it is-cheesy Kung-Fu with cheesy effects. Almost too much to bear, but it has good characters and a good enough plot. This movie is not for everyone."
3,It could have been better!,"A chilling look at how we can manipulate our ""prime motivators"" and outselves.Overly jargon-ish (I am an AI professional, and I found it profoundly difficult to follow along in some passages), and tepid in some places. Would have made an AMAZING short story."
3,a good book but...,but when you compare it to other frank herbert books it falls a bit short. the charachters and the story are not as well envisioned as others he has done. it is a good idea to read this book if you want to read the jesus incident.
4,solar shields,"I find these pretty good at reducing glare from headlights when driving at night. The yellow color doesn't distract and you can clearly see traffic signals. since I wear theses over prescription bifocals, there is a little problem with reflections bounding around, but otherwise they work fine.N"
5,Precious,"Mothers, I implore you. Buy these books for your daughters! They will cultivate a true love of reading that will last forever. This book series means so much to me it's difficult to express. I grew up reading every book so fervently and would continue on with the next book in the same manner. The lessons I've learned from these books will be with me forever.The book series describe a different time when people actually knew their neighbors and jam would never be purchased at a store. Laura is such an admirable character because of her courage, kindness, and creativity. The mistakes she makes also show her to be very real. The books do a stellar job of describing the American experience through the perspective of a young girl. I will forever cherish these books."
2,The Complete Little House Nine-Book Set,"The company selling the books started the shipping process right away. Somewhere in this process labeling came of the package and books sat as there was no delivery address on package. We were able to track the books down but was almost a month before we finally received the package. Luckily I ordered early as these books were for my grandson's birthday. They did arrive 2 days prior to his birthday, thankfully. When the books got to our house, almost all books were damaged, one ripped almost in half. Most of the other books were damaged as well. The books are in Amazon are displayed in a case which holds them. The books came in large box without the case and were strewn about the large box. Had the books come in a timely manner, undamaged and in case, it would have been a good value."
3,The Complete Little House Nine-Book Set.,"Disappointed that this set wasn't in full-color!! However, we just love the Little House Books. Just wish that this ""complete set"" would have been in color!"
5,Lose myself in these books!,I grew up on Little House on the Prairie books and want my grandchildren to have their own set. We live in such a techno age that it's hard for young ones to imagine the kind of life Laura Ingalls lived. We have all watched the complete television series and are now starting to read these books again! Love em!
2,Great Stories - CHEAP Set,"The stories within this set are still the wonderful stories I remember as a kid, but I would recommend getting a higher quality set if you plan on having it around awhile. The books are the very cheap paper back books and they are all placed in a flimsy cardboard book set. The pictures of the set looked nice, but the quality is not there."
5,A story for all ages............,"I remember seeing the TV series "" Little house on the prairies "" and loved it. Now at age 82 I am thoroughly enjoying the 9 books Laura wrote in 1932. These are obviously children books but adults will get to know a type of life we have never encountered or visualized. The courage and tenacity it must have taken to live in such conditions are not easily imagined in our time of instant everything, from meals to communication, from travel to health and medical miracles........ Read these booklets with the spirit of the child inside you and you will love them. They will bring you, for a short while, to a time in life you may have forgotten.Thanks to Amazon for making them available."
5,the product is great !!! The shipping was prompt,The shipping was prompt!!! package looked great !!!!
5,Bargain for the price!,"We needed some margarita glasses for our bar and these were exactly what we were looking for. They are sturdy, nice, and come in a very handy storage box! Great value for the price!!"
2,Fantastiks,The show might be very entertaining but the CD is quite boring with only one song worth replaying.
4,Cool.,"In the second installment of the Man-Kzin Wars, one of the most interesting Kzinti characters is introduced: Chuut Riit. I love it when they get into the personalities of these aliens, cause it's just plain absurd, and you want to read more. Like, at one point, you're introduced, albeit briefly to a Kzinti computer nerd. A KZINTI computer nerd!!! This is just cool. I'm sorry, but in dealing with Man-Kzin Wars books it all comes down to that. Can't say more than that. Cool."
3,"Enjoyable, as was the first in the series.","This is the second book in a series in which Larry Niven invites otherauthors to write stories set in his world, stories dealing with theinteractions between humanity and the Kzinti, a warrior race evolvedfrom carnivorous hunting cats rather than omnivorous monkeys. Thisbook is a perfectly enjoyable sequel to the first collection, and likethe first collection, it is a good but not a great read."
2,Good and Bad,"The first story, a sequel to Cathouse is very good--with plausible action and an interesting theory of why the Neanderthals became extinct.The second story is auful with plot holes non-sensical dialogue and is a fourth-rate rip-off of Casablanca--right down to the pitiful woman who is willing to sleep her way so that her husband and she can get to a better life. Absolutely terrible!Worth it for the first story--don't waste your time with the second."
4,Daniel O'Donnell and Friends,"I purchased this video for my 81 years young mother. She adores Daniel O'Donnel's music. She has nearly worn out the video. As I write this, my 82 year old mother in-law is not only enjoying the presentation, she is giggling,humming and singing along with it. Yes, Daniel O'Donnell may not be for the Irish purest or younger generation but,at 54 myself, I have no trouble enjoying this man's performance of old Irish balads, a little mix of country artists, some Elvis, and he is now singing ""How Great Thou Art."" My mother in-law said ""This is better than any movie!"" I am about to order two more copies."
4,Kids side better than adults,"There is lots of good information in this book. The kids side is a much easier read. My 11 year old son keeps picking up the book and thumbing through it and I get good stuff out of the kids side, too.The adult side is very text-book. The writing style is awkward and hard to follow. However, if you stick with it past the first 100 pages, you can begin to find information that is applicable. Most of the first bit is background and theory.I am purchasing a sceond copy of this book as a year-end thankyou for our G&T; program coordinator."
5,Great Bead Maze!!,My 2yr old son got this for Christmas & he loves it!! He plays with it often & usually for about 20 minutes at a time.
5,Great CD,"This here CD has everthing from Peter Gabriel that I want to hear, then lots of tunes that I have never heard before and like alot! It is one of the very very few that I can Play from start to finish an not skip songs.I enjoy it and it is sure to see lots of play time in my player."
3,hum de dum dum dum,"some marvelous music here but i prefer the stuff he did in the 70's with Genesis and his early solo albums which are not featured here. He has collaborated with many artists throughout his career like sinead o connor,Kate bush, Daniel Lanois, Tony levin and a bunch of African artists. A lot of his materiel needs time to registar. Bit weird."
5,Peter Gabriel Rocks,"This is a great compilation of Gabriel's music history. While favoring the recently produced works, there are still the old gems you love form him, like Solisbury Hill. This is a double CD, so there is a lot of music for you to enjoy."
4,Good overall Web services intro book,"I am totally new to Web services, and know not a lot about XML. This book I found was for me a very nice general overall introduction to webservices. It was enough to get me immediatley started in Web services. I can definitley recommend this book to anyone new to Web services."
1,I gave up on Web services after reading this book!,I would rather wait for the tech to mature for better quality books. I got lost and never proceeded to read after a fewinitial chapters. My advice to the authors would be to keep the readers interested and not throw him/her off course and lose interest totally in the subject.
3,Basic Intro to an Amazing Concept from a Rent-Seeker,"This is a decent explanation of the amazing concept of a space elevator that could, with the right technological and political developments, take people and goods into Earth orbit cheaply. Brad Edwards hoped to advance the concept through government largesse. There is also an entrepreneurial side of the story, pursued by Edwards's former partner Michael Laine. Laine's LiftPort has come out of hibernation and is chasing this dream once again. Check their website here: [...]."
3,Apostrophe's Apostasy,"This engineer's quite positive reaction to this technically impressive book is overshadowed by his own obsession with the mundane topics of spelling and punctuation. That's much more my own problem than it is the author's. But for any of my fellow obsessives out there who consider taking on this book, I must warn you, there's hardly a page where you won't find yourself grinding your teeth over the lack of respect for the standards of our language. Unfortunately for us apostrophe freaks, that can lead to an irrational lack of confidence in the logic and mathematics of the content.Otherwise, this is a very interesting and complete presentation of an important approach to escaping our planet."
3,Going nowhere...,"I was really looking forward to the latest NC album, but unfortunately it's disappointing. It's all over the map and unmemorable. None of the songs stands out. They sometimes sound like a pop band, but they seem to hold on to their bluegrass roots in a gratuitous way.The recording quality is flat and compressed. Their past recordings had life and vitality. This one's dull.I think Nickel Creek the band is over. Chris Thile has taken too much of a lead. Granted, he's talented, but I think he's moved on from the band.If you like NC a lot then I would buy this album. But as another reviewer said, if this was their first release they would have drifted into obscurity."
2,Too dense to be interesting,"Roberts gets two stars for packing the history of the world into a 1000+ pages with great accuracy and few oversites. He covers just about everything, but space limitations mean he must strip out all the interesting details and most analysis of the forces driving events.What's left is a bunch of capsule summaries strung together chronologically. There are no overarching themes or narrative to tie everything together. In short, this book is little better than a low-budget reference volume. It's about as interesting to read cover-to-cover as the encyclopedia."
2,Too much information to make it interesting,"This book covers a lot of history... being only 1000 pages it still covers the entire history of civilization.Unfortunately, this book tries to cover too much information in too little space to allow for interesting details of the history it covers. Instead of going into detail about the causes of certain events, it basically lists them, one after another in which gets boring somewhat quickly. Many other books on historical events or subjects (most of which are not as broad in scope as this one) are much more entertaining due to the amount of insight that they bring to the subject.It is a fine book if you need a reference for general history, but not if you want to be enlightened about history.Most of what it covers you have already learned in high school. It goes into very little depth."
3,Toughest book I ever read,"It took me a few years to finish reading this book. I'd get into it for a few weeks then have to put it down and read something lighter for a while. It's not for the casual reader or even a casual history buff. It's jam-packed with information on every page. By the time I finished, I'd forgotten most of what's in the beginning. It's very thorough. But it doesn't flow the way a novel does. Not even close. I had to consult a dictionary many, many times. I think the reader is expected to have a pretty good knowledge of history before beginning the book and a very good knowledge of English vocabulary. I wouldn't call it entertaining as much as informative."
1,Misleading title,"Had this book been called ""World History From a European point of view"", I would have given it five stars. Its very well written. But the title is misleading. This book is European History and how it was affected by world events. So many pages are dedicated to the fall of Byzantium, it sounds almost as if the author is trying to defend why the Christians 'lost' the Eastern kingdom to Islam. While almost a good chapter is spent on the intricate branches of Christianity, Lord Buddha is mentioned in the passing. While the entire Indian and Chinese civilations are summarized in about 10 pages, about a 100 are spent on some obscure Frankish kings.History of the World?? I don't think so. Disappointed."
2,"Complete yes, but Van Gogh, no.","A frustrating demonstration of poor publication practices, this book demeans the artist it pretends to celebrate with some of the worst color reproductions in print. Van Gogh might as well have let Taschen paint his work. Inexpensive, like forgery, with the same exploitive result."
4,A Respectful Exploration,"Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot explores six different themes of respect by profiling six individuals that she associates with those qualities. I found the book uneven between the chapters, but that is because I found some of the people she profiled more interesting than others. I particularly enjoyed her chapter on David Wilkins, the Harvard Law School Professor; his strides for excellence seems to measure merely his own inadequacies (his was the chapter on Self-Respect). I was fascinated reading about him.Still, I would recommend this book taken as an exploration--not definitive, not a self-help book, and not an exposition. But it is inspiring, challenging, informative, and she writes very well."
3,Respect: An Exploration,"In the book, ""Respect"" the author goes through many storeies of cases where people have given respect to others, some who are poor, sick etc. Lightfoot first goes into and talks about Respect in general, about how we all should give respect and be very respectfull to others in need. At first, there is stories of young mothers pregant who can not afford hospitlzation, and how the lady has a open clinic and takes care of numerous patients a day, for free. There is many other stories that are happy, sad, and humerous. This book opens a new world to me, and i think the more i think about it i would love to help people in need, to show that everyone should have respect even if they are not like everyone else."
3,Special Neeeds Trust Administration Manual,"Is a well written book but like anything with the passage of time, it needs to be updated. The basics are there and are helpfull.Thanks."
3,Can't Really Give a True Review of This Book Until We Set Up & Start Administering the Trust,"I live in Mass, so I have very high expectations for this manual. The authors live and work in Massachusetts. It's a lot of information, and a little overwhelming at first, but I think this will be a great tool once we get into establishing the trust. That's why I can only rate this as a three right now. I don't think I'll be able to completely review this book until after we've gone through the creation of the trust. This book isn't going to replace an attorney or financial advisor, but I'm hoping it will serve as a good resource for us to learn more about specific topics as we dive in. I've only read the first two chapters, as our baby is only three months old, but it has already done a pretty good job of explaining SSI and SSDI. I'm most impressed at the explanations and descriptions of how the individual's income (the special needs individual) can affect the public benefit programs received."
4,Destiny will have its way.,"Fans of noir fiction will not be disappointed by Build My Gallows High, a dark tale of ill-fated love. Red Bailey runs a gas station in a small scenic town near the California-Nevada border. His mysterious, shady past does not discourage the lovely, virtuous Ann Miller from falling madly in love with him. In fact it could possibly be that Bailey's dubious past contributes to Ann's unconditional devotion to him.But, like an unwelcome ghost, Bailey's past comes back to haunt him in the form of femme fatale Mumsie McGonigle. Mumsie has the curious habit of destroying the male of the species with the same predictability as the female praying mantis.Build My Gallows High is an early, unvarnished example of hardboiled crime that compares quite favorably with the best of James M. Cain and other pioneers of the noir genre. Highly recommended."
5,The best Book Ever!,"I love to play with model horses and now I have a Book full of pictures of my models. If I ever have to sell my models I am going to use this book. I have really liked how they have every model Breyir has made so I can choose one I like and show my mom and dad and maybe get it for Christmas! I think this is a good book for kids who like to collect toy horses. It would be sort of silly for grown ups, thouh, 'cuz they would not need toy horses. But even thouh no grown ups collect horse toys becas they are too old, I am going to collect Breyirs when i am older becas I love them"
1,"Does not flow well, poor introduction to COM","This book doesn't flow well, for example: the chapter on COM Architecture is too deep in. Each chapter reads like it's own mini-book leaving the reader to wonder if there was any editing and reviewing at all.The subject is not dished out at beginners level (you might as well spend the extra $ and get Professional ATL), if you already have a background on COM and you work hard you'll find this a bit useful. But I wouldn't recommend it at all. I've read about half the book, and I'm still left confused and wondering who's choice it was to take this approach to structure and why on earth Wrox would approve it..."
4,Bought this as a gift ......,I gave this to my girlfriend's 17 year old daughter who hopes to be a fashion designer. It was a big hit with her and her gal-pals!
1,Wish I could rate it 0 stars Don't even think of buying it,"This book was a freebie from Amazon when you purchase a WACOM tablet. It is a MINI pocket sized book.A $9.99 value? Please... a roll of paper towels has more to read then this book.Amazon, save a tree, ditch giving this book away."
4,Great book,"This book includes a wonderful collection of material produced by Rommel. The production quality of the text is barely acceptable, but it is readable. I found the material quality high enough to endure the print issue. Could not give it a 5 due to the print quality."
2,I'm back!,"This was, obviously, not a terribly interesting (or accurate) account of my life. Nevertheless is it a pretty good overview and hits most of the high points. And for the record, I am still mad at the Italians for pilfering materiel, which is why I spend most of my days haunting Naples.I want my papers back!"
4,facinating,"This text provideds a facinating insight into the mind ofField Marshall Erwin Rommel through out his campaigns in theSecond World War. This detailed display of real manuscriptswritten by the soldier shows the ambitious, zealous, andsometimes dashing style through which he upset Alliedcommanders time and time again with minimal forces and limitedsupplys. For any person that is intrigued by the art of war orhas a deep intrest in history, this book will captivate untillthe last page is turned."
4,Portable DVD player,This player has good resolution and excellent reliable play back of DVD movies.The volume control is not loud enough to hear a movie while traveling in a car. When the volume is maxed out to high the road noise in a car overwhelms the playback making the words in a movie unable to hear.
2,too bulky,"They are SOOOO bulky, and it seems they don't whisk away ANY mositure. I just use a pre-fold and leave it folded hotdog style and put that in the diaper cover, works just as well, and less bulky! Or I sometimes just use the inserts for my bumgenius. this is totally unnecessary, but soft... so if that's all that matters..."
5,Linda Ronstant,I love her music. She can sing anything. I have her old albums (remember LPs?). The CDs are even better.
1,Awful,"I think Mark Coleman (a writer for ""Rolling Stone"") said it best when he said, ""It seems relatively certain that Uriah Heep is the real-life Spinal Tap."""
3,John Hicks is the greatest as always,"This is a recording. John Hicks is great, as good as any.This recording lacks freshness and freedom. Sorry.I know the attempt was to have a little masterpiece here,but something is missing. Maybe the participantsbesides Hicks tried too hard. Valiant try, but not there."
2,Boring - A shame,"Sorry for fans from barbara mason, this are not the original hit recordings. The songs are recorded later, but brilliant. For Fans a must, but a collector who wants to have the originals a shame -- sorry !!!!"
5,the star witch,THS BOOK WAS GREAT I HAVEN'T READ A GREAT BOOK FOR A WHILE ALL THE SISTER STORIES WERE GOOD BUT THIS ONE BEATS THEM ALL. I WOULD LOVE TO READ SOME MORE OF YOUR BOOKS.
4,For dog lovers,This is very cute for those who enjoy dogs. Also very good for children since there is no reading--just pictues.
1,The Best for blocking the sun's glare,"Just Great, there's nothing better to give your eye's a well deserved rest."
5,Small price - Large size,"Solar Shields is a great product.Solar Shields for $5.95 is is even better.Solar Shields size large (not advertised as such), for a person with face size medium.... worthless!"
2,Horrible. Just horrible.,"It's been a few days since I rented this and I still can't get over how horrible it was on so many levels. The plot is just dumb, for one...but in the days since I watched it I'm actually very disturbed by the fact that someone actually made a movie about a guy faking cancer to get attention. I actually liked the main actor in another movie he's in (the one where he plays a guy who ends up dating a guy who is also dating his father). That's why I took a chance on ""the love patient"". Very few gay movies are ""good"" in the sense that they are well-made or well-written...but this is honestly the first movie in a while that I've seen that made me want to take a shower afterwards.I still can't get over how horrible it was for this guy to fake having cancer and put people through the emotional terrorism of that. And nobody really had that big of a problem with him doing this, which is disturbing.I wish I had not watched this, but what was seen cannot be unseen at this point."
3,Nice but not that nice,"I loved the concept, and let's be honest, most of all would do the same for love (or him, whatever works better for you). I think that the action happens too fast, so the story is not able to be told the way it was supposed to.Good movie, you should watch it, but it will not define the rest of your life for sure."
3,Follow Me Boys.,"Should be region 0 or 2, but was 1. Should also be PAL, but was NTSC.Otherwise OK, it replaces my old Betamax copy."
5,Follow me Boys,"Excelent !! It is a good movie, a bit like a guy being a hero to the youth, but giving young men someone to look up to. I am glad that I bought it.it is a great look into the past that has lessons that will never change for people that want to make a good differance in their community !I recomend it ~ John"
1,Utter Trash,"I was scared as soon as the disk started with a goof ball in a bad tux, sitting in a dimly lit room, introduced the making of Grand Prix. The quality of the introductory shots must have been done on a 1980's vintage VHS hand held. The film, as said in earlier reviews, is maybe 15 minutes long, and must have been done as a theater promotion, or as something shone on the old CBS Friday Night Movies used to show as filler in the 1960's. I can give you the accurate time, because I have not looked at the disk again due to embarrassment. What makes it worse is that I have been waiting for three months (as of late December 03') for the widescreen VHS version; sense there is no DVD available. Save your time and money!"
1,worthless,This is nothing but a bad rehash of the actors' bios in Grand Prix. There is far more interesting stuff about the actual filming on the two dvd Grand Prix set. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Not what you've seen on Speed Channel,"I thought this video would be similar to the ""making of Grand Prix"" that has been aired on the cable Speed Channel (Speed TV) with interviews with Frankenheimer and the cast. It is really a collection of old racing films with just a small amount of footage from the production of the film. I'd say this is a good case of ""you get what you pay for"" ... not much content for not much money. A disappointment."
1,The Description Is Misleading,"I weas led to believe, from the description, that there was more to this film than there actually is. I expected there to be information on all of the aspects of the filming of the fantastic movie, only to find that there was one short on the filming of the Monaco GP and a terrible hodge-podge of news clips of every fiery accident that had ever taken place on or near a racetrack. This DVD is for ghouls only."
5,The 13th Valley,Got to me in the exact time indicated (it might have even arrived earlier than I anticipated). The condition was exactly as promised. Thank you very much.
5,"BY FAR THE GREATEST VIETNAM NOVEL I""VE EVER READ.","To John Del Vecchio, Allthough I was only sixteen whan I read this book, I will never forget the way it made me feel about Vietnam. As I grew older I wanted to learn about my county's history - not just through a textbook though. In a tiny used bookstore in East coast Michigan, while on vacation, I snatched your book of the shelf with little anticipation. Now, in retrospect, it was the greatest novel I have ever had the honor to read. You are a true American for serving our great country during Vietnam. I have the utmost respect for you and the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne. I am proud to say that I wept at the end of this book. My hats off to you Cherry. Scott Heine"
1,East Side Kids/Bowery Boys,"There are 8 movies on 2 discs. That alone would make for not so good a picture. The first movie 'Spooks Run Wild' had a very bad picture,very dark; but I was able to follow the story line. After that,the second movie'Ghosts On The Loose' was just unwatchable. I don't know whether to call the picture frozen or jumpy but it was like that all the way thru.The audio was so broken up it couldn't be understood. The 3rd movie started the same way so I just turned it off.The 1st two movies are the only ones I really wanted and I have them ordered separately;also from Amazon. I really hope they will be watchable.I guess I'll have to throw the 1st 2 discs in the trash."
1,AHHHHH!,"I watched this video when I was a kid, I got bored after 2 seconds, and then, THERE IT WAS!!!!! A GIANT BUTTERFLY ON BARNEYS NOSE! I THOUGHT IT WAS EATING HIM OR SOMETHING!!! IT SCARED THE POOPOO OUT OF ME!!!"
5,Solid,"Solid. What else can I say? Great design, sleek black color, smooth hinge action. It is made for mountain climbing, but I'm going to use it to rig up a hammock."
5,You must buy this single,"I just got this cd today. I had to have it special ordered since its an import single. I had my doubts on whether it would be worth $ 12.99 for a single, but boy, I'm glad I took the chance. I love this song so much. Its worth the money to hear all the remix versions that are not on her album. In my opinion, this is the best song she's ever done and you will not be dissapointed if you buy this cd. It's worth $12.99 and a whole lot more. The only thing wrong I can find about it is that it was released in Australia, Asia and UK and not here!!"
1,Clasical music at its worst,"As a former astronaut with the US Space Program, I feel I am qualified to judge the calliber of this video, and I must say it reeks. The timpani is off beat and the violin players continually emit horrible sqeaking sounds. Ugh!"
5,pci hot-plug,"It is a very good book for an engineer.PCI Hot-plug is an important technology for us to learn.The technology will bring huge effects in industry.If you want to devise card of PCI,I will advise you to read the book.The book will tell you many knowledges about PCI Hot-plug.It's exciting."
1,"Waste of time, waste of money","Okay, where do I begin? I thought this would be not necessarily a serious weapon for the price, but I thought it would shoot. Unfortunately, it did and broke itself. Me, being the documenting type, was recording when it snapped, so if you are still considering buying this, let me send you the video. I did manage to send it back, but it cost me $11.12 to ship back, and they acted like nothing came to them for three weeks, and I decided to call Amazon. Amazon got me my money back, but not the shipping, but still, Kudos! to Amazon. I was really upset, because I felt cheated.So we are clear, I had an experience friend set it up. We did not dry fire it. The arrow came with the crossbow that it broke. It broke on the bottom piece; it is plastic. Please, do not buy this, and save yourself the trouble."
1,Waste of money,"Do not buy this product. Firstly, it didnt ship for Christmas, it was reordered and then it arrived late (jan 2013)After assembly the string broke immediately on pulling back the loader. This product is a complete and utter waste of money, and it should be removed. Had I read the reviews I wouldnt have ordered it. The hassel trying to get the product, means I will not waste time trying to get a refund, as I not prepared to pay the shipping. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,pistol crossbow,my husband used it twice then the plastic string guards broke and then he noticed that a nut on the pull arm guard had fallen off.
3,cross bow,"works great,really fun, nice to have will really hurt someone if needed, but this is the bad part anyone will have trouble putting this together is SUCKS!!!"
4,No complaints so far.,"I have only fired this about five times ( I live in a city so I used my basement for a firing range, unbeknownst to my wife ). It sinks the bolt 1/2"" deep into a 2"" thick piece of old pine from about 10 feet. So it has the power to deter a four or two legged rat.I was able to string the bow myself but it is difficult. String one end, put that end on a mattress and use your knee to hold the device while bending the bow. Use a mattress or the plastic tip will break (yes I found out the hard way).It is easy and fairly quick to reload. Like I said I only shot it a few times so I don't know how durable it is. It seems sturdy but some reveiwers claim otherwise.I bought this because all the pistol crossbows are cheap, and I don't know if there is any difference between this and those that sell for 2X or 3X more."
4,great product for the price,I must say that my delivery showed up pretty quickly. However I ruined it within an hour of practice shooting. I guess the string was beginning to fray and it doesn't shoot with accuracy due to the string becoming undone.
1,very dissapointed,"It took forever to get my pistol, never did get the extra arrows, but it doesn't matter the first time I shot it, it broke. oh well."
3,hooked by the line & sinking....,"Okay, so I got hooked on this sci-fi series; the characters are okay, the premise interesting ...all in all, not bad. The thing that bugs me most is that the 2nd book was due out in Oct 99, but it showed up Feb 00. I had to reread the 1st book so I could remember what was happening! So, I'm not going to bother looking for book 3 (""coming this fall"") until _next_ February. At least, with Stephen King's series, readers weren't strung along like this."
3,"looks good, small drawers, chips easily","Overall this is great inexpensive furniture that looks good. It does chip easily and will probably not last more than a few years. But it's great for an apartment. My husband and I bought it to get us through apartment living for a few years before we get a house and a ""real bedroom set"". The one big negative is the depth of the drawers, they are really small. It was easy to assemble as long as you follow the directions line by line."
4,A Comedic Genius at Work,"This is a nostalgic reminiscence of the long-running ""You Bet Your Life"" show, which started out on radio and then in 1950 moved to television. It was in the top ten in ratings during the entire period it was on the air, up until near the end.What strikes me about the account is how carefully choreographed the show was, belying the impression that it was casually done using Groucho's great ad lib ability. In fact, the show used many writers, and the guests were extensively interviewed beforehand to determine areas of interest and humor. If something didn't work on the show, they simply edited it out, as they shot more footage than they needed for each show.The book gives the reader a good feel for what the show was like for those making it. You get the feeling that this was the perfect TV vehicle for Groucho's unique brand of humor. Certainly the TV audience appreciated it by keeping it on the air for so long."
5,One of the Best Romantic Comedies every made,This is a cult favorite for so many people I see and well deserving. You can watch it over and over again (in black and white) and still laugh your ass off.
5,Colour Me Black and White,"Those of you who are true Prince fanatics will understand my review title. This movie is a must have for all Prince fans loyal and few? With purple blood running thru our veins, Prince waves his magical guitar at us and turns our blood black and white. (How poetic) Filmed in black and white, we see Prince and his concubines in a whole new spectrum. You can't take your eyes off Prince when he is bathing in a bath filled with rose petals or when he is dancing with Mary in the south of France while ""Alexa de Paris"" quietly plays in the backgound. ""Under The Cherry Moon"" conjures up romantic images that fill your heart with love and joy, making life seem so nice in this cruel, cruel world. Do I lie? No. Love or $?.......LOVE. Ballad rock you just can't stop, Ballad rock you just can't stop. Welcome 2 The Dawn."
5,The best,"Not as good as Purple Rain, but this movie is awesome. You will enjoy it. Jerome Benton is the man.WRECKA STOW!"
2,so-so,"I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole."
1,Close call for Mary Lambert,"The best part of watching this movie in the theater was the trailer for James Cameron's ""Aliens"". Mary Lambert was very lucky that Prince fired her and took over directing duties of this train wreck because her career would have ended then and there."
1,Makes Elvis' Harum Scarum look like Citizen Kane,"Whoa, mama, what was Prince thinking? What an embarassment and a detour in an otherwise brilliant career. He never really engages in dialogue, just makes grunts and faces at people."
5,etheral,"My favorite Coltrane album, The entire band, which includes Eric Dolphy, gives truly inspired and searching prefomances. Coltranes solo on ""My Favorite Things"" sends me to another realm everytime I hear it, ""Blue Train"" roars and swings like crazy, some of Dolphy's most imaginative blues work. The sound in the concert hall is excellent. This is the only album I've ever felt obligated to review; for me, its one the greatest jazz recordings, though relatively unknown."
4,Killer by Nature,Exciting Thriller! An ending with a twist! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Much better than I expected.
3,NBA Live 2000 for PC,"I got this game because my friend had one. It's real cool. It took a while for me to figure the game out, but I'm getting the hang of it. It says most of the players names, too. Sometimes even if you create players it says their name. It is a fun game for NBA fans."
3,Is there an editor at WROX?,"I will echo what Aaron said about grammar, etc, it is HORRIBLE. Moreover, I have found four separate instances of error-riddled code so far (I'm on chapter 5 currently) and I've reported them to WROX with a suggested fix. For instance, the author(s) will tell you to name a form ""x"" and then on the response page they will refer to the form as ""xy."" It's frustrating.Besides the errors and horrific grammar issues, I REALLY enjoyed the book up until chapter 3. I was really getting into it and understanding everything until it went into variables/variants and suddenly turned into a VERY, VERY technical and disjointed read. I'm now struggling like heck in Chapter 5 and retaining very little info.If you're a beginner, I'd say skip this book and get something more intuitive.Just my .02"
4,"Overall, a good book","The explanations of the examples presented in the text were excellent. Very easy to understand and follow.The supposed grammar problems were not a problem to me, possibly because I am not a grammar expert myself. I hardly even noticed any.The one thing about this book that did bother me however, was the order of the content. The chapters on error handling, scripting objects, and ASP components, seemed extremely out of place. These chapters contain information that is not critical to the average ASP developer, yet they come ahead of basic information such as database connectivity. I think that most people want to access a database before they want information about Ad Rotation!"
5,Invaluable and Practical,"This resource is at the top of my professional library list. Its easy to use format and comprehensiveness allows our teachers to design assessments that align with rigorous state assessments. Spence and Shari sure do ""know their stuff"" and have been instrumental in moving our district forward!"
4,Fantastic CD from a great band,"This is my favorite Hi-Risers cd yet. Standouts include That Rock & Roll Beat, Red Kazoo, Ready Teddy, and the somber Daddy Mows the Grass. Anyone who's into 60's sounding rock & roll should buy this. Music the way it should be."
2,New and Revised usually mean bad signs ahead.,"I enjoy reading books that I know or feel that I may not agree with; however, this book is an Encyclopedia and a reference book is skewed by the writers for purposes unknown. I tire myself looking at books that do not give correct answers. If I do not understand a word that I am reading, I look up the answer. I once took me four days to find that correct meaning to a word that I was looking for. I have found that for myself staying away from new, revised, and such other names of books take me farther away from the answers I am looking for. This book for me is easy to read, answers are easy to find, but to liberal and often off subject. I would not recommend this encyclopedia for serious minded biblical scholars."
1,Where's the guide for the PC version?,"I bought this thinking that the PC version would be the same. I was wrong! The maps are NOTHING alike. So, Amazon, where's the PC version of the guide?"
1,Save Your Money,This was one of the first SIM type DVDs and I could never get it to work. Even if you followed instructions the program was lousy.
3,An ok game,This game keeps you entertained briefly but you always want tocome back later. The game doesnt have many options. But you can make stratagies and try different things. The game is very challenging and you rarely have a succesful farm. There are many more details that are quite aggrivating such as they give a tiny plot of land and you cant ever get more or atleast that I know of. The graphics arent good. The game can be quite fun so buy it if you like. Have Fun** from Gutseygirl (i know what im talking about)
3,"Good Alarm For Waking Up, but Cheaply Made",PROS:Adjustable VolumeGreat at waking you upCons:Cheaply made (several of the number displays burned out after 2 months)
2,Poor Quality Made in China but Functions ok,"The vibration is a little noisy, if you just put it under your pillow. If would e better if there is a vibration speed control"
5,Wakes the dead.,If the alarm isn't loud enough you aren't human.. and the bed rumble is a cherry on top! Love to use the rumble only to keep from waking everyone in the house.
5,Paradoxically Powerful & Mellow,"I'll spare you the details, but I just don't wake up easily. I can set multiple alarms and still oversleep.This thing works. The beeping alarm is INCREDIBLY loud even on 5, but I don't use it.The vibrating pod wakes me up instantly without being unpleasant. I don't know why. It just does. The cord is just long enough that I have to get out of bed to hit the snooze.My roommate doesn't hear it at all. Unfortunately, my downstairs neighbor hears the vibration through the floor. Now I have to find some way to cushion the vibration on the floor because there is no way I'm giving this thing up."
2,It's loud and wakes you up but the time is not consistent,"Before I bought the product I remember reading a comment were someone said that the time of the clock dissaranges, for some unknown reason. This was unfortunately my case also. It really wakes you up because it's loud (in that part is very effective) but you can't have it turned on like a regular alarm clock because the time dissaranges automatically."
4,It works!,I bought this product so my pre-teen son would get out of bed for school.It works! It also shakes and wakes the whole house. I am very happy that I bought it.
3,Sonic Boom Clock,The clock is not as loud as mentioned. The only thing good about it is the vibrating part that goes under the mattress. If you want something loud get a radio clock instead of this. I recommend this clock only for the vibration to get you up.
3,It will wake the dead but...,If you like to hit the snooze this isn't the best alarm. The snooze and the off buttons are pretty the same and close together. It's too easy to hit the off when you intend to hit the snooze.
4,Excellent alarm clock,Its great since you can have it either on ringer & or vibrate. If you choose the ringer you still have an option of how loud it should ring instead of just of one level. Thank you.
4,It Works,"It actually wakes my 16-year old son up enough that he hits the snooze. Still have to tell him to get up, but at least I don't have to go into his room every 9 minutes to tell him to hit the snooze."
5,Will wake the dead,This clock does exactly what I wanted it to do. It literally shakes me out of bed. It's very loud and the vibrator works great even under a very thick mattress and foam top. I ordered it right before Christmas and wasn't expecting it until after the holidays but it got here two days before Christmas. This is a great clock! Easy to set and stays set. It has multiple alarm options as well.
2,Poorly Made,"I have purchased from Amazon numberous times and never felt strongly enough of a product to write a review - up until now. I purchased this for my sister who has a very difficult time getting up. I received this and it is extremely cheaply made. It is cheap plastic. Yes the alarm is loud, and yes the vibrating disc is quite effective. However, I cannot see this working too long given the poor quality of this product. Also, mine did not operate under battery backup power. So - this needed to be returned anyway."
1,Waste of time,"Purchased one of these alarm clocks and it did not work right out of the box. So I oreded another one to replace it figuring that the first one was just a lemon. When the second one arived, it did not work either. I would not consider anything else from this manufacturer after seeing the ""quality"" of their products."
4,Very Good Alarm Clock,"Finally I found an alarm clock that can wake me up, although I am a very deep sleeper. Yesterday I slept at 3:00 am and I wanted to wake up at 4:30 am, but I wake up at 5:30. This is accomplishment by itself because with other alarm clocks I would not wake up at all with this little amount of sleep. I like the vibrator very much, it really helps a lot. The reasons I am giving this product only 4 out of 5 are:1- It has only one alarm clock, so if you want to wake up at two different times you have to set the alarm every time2- The volume is very loud, but is not extremely loud as I expected"
3,I wake up early to make sure I can turn it off,"The buzzer on this alarm is pretty cool and amusing to wake up to. The alarm, however, is pretty annoying. It sounds like some sort of screeching, End-of-the-World alarm. So, I actually set the alarm on my cell phone to wake up first and pretty much use this alarm as an emergency back up. To its credit, I haven't overslept when using my newfound double alarm system."
3,Sonic Alert Alarm,"I expected a much louder alarm, although yes, it is a little louder than the ""normal"" alarm clock. Find a hard surface to place the shaker on, and you will jump out of bed to that sound. Louder than normal, not as loud as I wanted. Will probably work for most people."
5,Shake and Wake!,"Man, this thing is so effecient I sometimes want to take a hammer to it just so it would stop waking me up! :) I put it on both vibrating and beeping mode since I am a heavy sleeper, and it gets me up every time."
2,"Cheap clock, nice vibrating part","Pros:1. The vibration part works wellCons:1. Power cord is too short for a king-size bed with outlet centered and bedside table. It needs to be another foot or two longer. I had to use an extension cord.2. The clock is horrible. Setting time is the laborious hold the hour or minute button down and watch it slowly scroll from 1 to whatever number you need. C'mon, man! That was good for first generation digital clocks, but give us at least +/- and faster speed as the button is held down. Sheesh.3. The button for turning off the alarm is too small to quickly find and push when waking up.4. The light is not dimmable, and is too bright.5. The volume control is a joke. Pathetic."
3,It would be a fantastic clock if it were more durable.,"This clock does a great job of waking me up, so it's very important to me. I've owned two of these clocks, yet both have stopped functioning in the past year. The first stopped working after having been packed in a suitcase; even though no damage was apparent, I figured that maybe the clock might have had a rough trip. The second clock, however, just stopped working after four months in a quiet residence. Although I can't figure out what has gone wrong, my impression is that this clock is not durable. I would pay more for a clock of this type that would remain functional for a longer time."
2,Cheaply made clock,"The clock is contained in a very thin, cheap plastic. The alarm is loud and has sound control. All the settings are on top and the buttons are small; including the snooze button. It's a cheap product certainly not worth $25. I don't recommend it."
5,Terrific,This alarm is great for those who are hard of hearing. The option to have the shaking bed allows awakening without waking a partner.
2,Good for the hard of hearing,I expected the vibrating part to be similar in intensity to cell phone vibration but it was too powerful for my taste. The clock itself is pretty light and the off button is placed to the side and not easily accesible.
2,Not LOUD!,"We got this after reading the great reviews on how loud it was, we are both heavy sleepers and have a hard time waking up. This alarm clock is not loud at all, The alarm, is annoying, but not louder then any ol clock for less then 1/2 this price. The alarm is compariable with my cel phone's alarm. If your a truely a deep sleeper, DO NO BUY THIS!"
1,Boring/Overbearing,"In the Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah voice alternates between boring and overbearing...either come hither whispers, out right screaming, or eardrum shattering high notes. Mariah never has been a true soul singer and this album confirms it. She goes through the motions but never connects with the emotions. The songwriting is derivative and unimaginative....copying either current trends or old standards. The last song, cringe-worthy."
1,never heard such a garbage,"mariah has always been a no-talented ugly slut, but this time it's the worst case..... die, mariah, that's the best you can do. never heard such an awful cd"
2,"I like Mariah, but this!",I like Mariah. I think she is a very talented vocalist. I love a lot of her songs. I was however disappointed with this one. I have heard better from her. It's Like That was alright. We Belong Together was good. Shake it off and Fly like a bird are my 2 favorites off of this cd. It just seemed that every other song began to sound the same as the other one. It was hard to distinguish from one track to another. There are some good ones though. Check it out and see what you think
5,Great Great Accomplishments,I am also very happy about those much deserved Grammy Nominations 8--WOW..madonna eat your heart out!
4,VERY GOOD,MARIAH CAREY IS ON A ROLL AND THIS CD KEEPS IT GOING. I HAVE THE CD AND I HAVE TO SAY I LIKE MOST OF THE SONGS. SOME OF THE BALLADS ARE BORING BUT ALL IN ALL THIS IS WORTH BUYING
5,The voice isn't back; it's always been there!,"I have been a fan of Mariah Carey's since her debut album. Even at the tender age of nine I had great taste :). Anyway, it's so great to see that my favorite singer is back on top although she will forever remain number one in my book. As for the voice: I honestly believe that the ""lackluster"" album Charmbracelet (I liked it)was a clever marketing/publicity ploy. With the onset of that album came the rumors that Mariah had irrevocably lost her voice and this is the reason why she was forced to hold back vocally on the last album. Well, I guess she fooled a lot of people because on Emancipation of Mimi her voice is as strong and powerful as ever. And because she actually Sings on this album more and more people bought the album,which put her right back on top. Great job Mariah! Anyway, I hope her next single is either. One and Only or Stay the Night. Those and We Belong Together are the best ones!"
5,Feeling Emancipated,"Yes, I'm sure you've read that tile like a million times when going through these reviews but it's true. My mind and spirit have truly been freed by this album. ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" was exactly what I needed. Words cannot really express how genuinely happy I am with this album.FAVORITES:It's Like ThatWe Belong TogetherMine AgainStay The NightOne And OnlyI Wish You KnewJoy RideFly Like A Bird"
5,Lovin' Mimi,"This marks Mariah's second album from Universal and is better than that dismal Charmbracelet, or Rainbow, or, yes, Glitter.This is from a review from USA today, which i totally agree with:With her imitators all over radio and American Idol, it's sometimes hard to recall what pop-soul music sounded like before Carey came along. The diva herself remembers, though, as evidenced by the wistful, old-school vibe on Mine Again, Circles and other endearing new tunes. Breezy, playful tracks such as Say Somethin' (featuring Snoop Dogg) and Get Your Number (with Jermaine Dupri) prove the singer hasn't forsaken her passion for hip-hop. But it's the ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying."
1,Nothing special.,"Seriously, folks. This album is nothing special at all. Mariah used to be good. In the 1990s, she was the best selling female at the time. Celine Dion and Whitney Houston had to stand aside - even Madonna had to stand and watch Carey sell more records. (That's now changed. Madonna has outsold Mariah - ask the Guiness Hit Singles And Albums book.) If you're looking for a better artist than Mariah, go to Celine. She is one of the many Canadian superstars (others include Shania Twain, my personal favourite Daniel Powter and many others). She is Mariah without the annoying hip-hop and the guest rappers standing beside her. The highlights here are the singles, and Say Somethin'. The other tracks don't get my attention much. This is a somewhat average effort, though I've given it one star due to my dissapointment in comparison to other Mariah albums. Mariah has a brilliant voice - she's just not using it in the best way she can"
5,SHES BAAACCKK!!!,This cd is ab fab compared to charmbraclet. I love it the voice is finally back with something real. I love the flow of it and lyrics and kanyes song on the cd. Get it U wont regret It ....xxoo MS MIMI
1,Mariah's worst,"This isnt a very good album. If you heard ""We Belong Together"" then you have already heard the best this album has to offer."
4,Really Good!!,"Two years ago at this time, Mariah Carey was a joke. Sure, she was huge in the 90's, but then... she was nothing. Mariah Carey has made a huge comeback with her new CD ""Emancipation of Mimi"".Featuring the extremely popular hit's ""It's Like That"", and ""We Belong Together"" (which everyone was humming during the summer), this CD is awesome! Of course, there are some songs better than others. Some songs, I have to admit, are kind of boring (""Joy Ride""), but most of them are great ballads and feature MC's awesome voice (""We Belong Together, ""Mine Again""), and some are just plain fun (""One and Only (f/Twista)"", ""Get Your Number (f/Nelly""), and finally, one very inspirtation track (""Fly Like A Bird"").Overall, this album is great, and probably the #1 Album of the Year. Thank God Mariah Carey is back!"
5,Hits For Days,The Emancipation of Mimi a very fun record make no mistakes about it and it works. Reason being THE VOICE and the fact is you won't find a better one out there. This album truly has somethng for everyone and it's become apparent because Mimi hasn't left the top 5 since it's release. Now to the songs released so far.. It's Like That: party record with a hard beat...We Belong Together: most played radio song in history...Shake It Off new single that features a hot video..
2,Further down the toilet we go,"When she emerged in 1990, Mariah Carey seemed destined to be one of the most talented vocalists on the planet, and she unquestionably was for the first half of that decade. Unfortunately, she would soon make a decision that is unfortunately all too common in music today: reinvent herself to appeal mainly to the shallow mind. After a series of sub-par albums from the late 90s, ""The Emancipation Of Mimi"" was hailed by some publications as ""her best album in years."" Sorry, but not quite. She's in decent vocal form on ""Fly Like A Bird"" and a couple of others, but for the most part, she sings in a light feathery tone that sounds too much like many of the faceless posers that inundate today's music world. Plus, none of the songs (especially the ones on which she collaborates with rappers), are as deep and meaningful as anything she did a decade ago."
5,This CD is off the chain,"This CD is ""off the chain"" even though im a guy and everything this CD explains about her love. I understand what she is going through because im in love myself. This CD is good."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"If you're hoping for the style of music that made Mariah Carey famous, you're going to be tremendously disappointed. It appears that Ms. Carey has forever sacrificed her talents to the wishes of some rap producer somewhere, and settled for song after song of mindless drivel, set to the unoriginal, monotonous beat of a drum machine. There is virtually nothing redeeming or remarkable about this album, and the hoopla you're hearing about it is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the recording studio to sell as many copies of this as possible, before the word gets out about what a stinker it is and people quit buying it.To Mariah Carey I offer this sage bit of advice: fire your rapper managers and producers and go back to singing ballads and happy songs with a peppy beat. Anyone and their brother can rap, and it's a colossal waste of your talent to keep making such drivel as this. Get Walter Afanasieff back on your team and stop trying to prove anything. Sing, dammit!"
5,Welcome Back Mariah,"I purchased her original cd many years ago, and thought that she was one of the most gifted singers around.Years later, I'm so glad to see that she's still performing and producing great work. This cd reminds me of her original work. I hope that she continues to use what works best for her."
2,The Album As A Whole NO GOOD,Only 2 good songs in this Album the rest is (...)She needs to make music like she did in the DAYDREAM album and the MUSIC BOX album -- enough of this hip hop and rnb crap she is trying to do.. (...)!
3,First Two Songs are Great,"I enjoyed the first 2 songs on the album a lot. The rest was mediocre to bad. There's something about It's Like That and We Belong Together that gets you dancing and grooving, the rest is so-so.This winds up being another one of those albums where only one or 2 songs are really good. I don't feel it justifies the local music store's price of anywhere from $15 to $18. Amazon's price is tempting though, but I still don't feel motivated to buy Mariah's latest album.Ratings- scale of 1-10, 1 being worst and 10 being the best.1.It's Like That- 102.We Belong Together-10Rest of album tracks 3-14 is (ratings hover anywhere from a 5 to a 1) average to bad."
4,5.2 million Emancipation of Mimi Buyers (in the World) Cannot be wrong...,"Whoever was the last reviewer, the one that is trashing Mrs. Carey, get a life dude!..It is obvious this album has lived up to the hype and expectations...This has become a classic for both fans and new fans...This album has introduced many new fans to her Catalogue of albums from the 90's through 2000's..her music stands the test of time..anyway, Mimi is a fantastic and recommeneded C.D by me...and for those Crazy madonna Fans who keep comming here to trash Mariah, uhh, bow down to the real Queen....Mariah..5.2 million Emancipation of Mimi Buyers (in the World) Cannot be wrong..."
1,The Constipation of Caca,"Man oh man Mariah, how can you call this music!? This has to be the worst record of the year. Even worse then Ashlee Simpsons! And please Mariah, enough with these ghetto braindead thugs that you have on some tracks. They should be surving me fast food at a drive thru. Not appearing on songs with you. Your better than that."
1,Zzzzzz.......,"I also love the old Mariah, but this album is just DULL! Yes, she has gone back to her old sound somewhat. She has also reduced the appearance of the rappers constantly present on Glitter. I'm even glad that she's gotten rid of the silly album titles (Glitter, Charmbracelet?). But overall, this just puts me to sleep! The only songs worth listening to are the two singles!! Like the other negative reviews are saying, I also agree that this sounds just like any other R&B you can hear on the Top 40. It's nothing new, nothing different. As much as I hate to say it, this is Mariah's worst album. It's so bad, it actually makes me like Charmbracelet!!"
1,Same stuff.,"Well, I purchased the CD, and from what I heard, I think there is no water for it to stream, it has the usual Mariah ballads, and the same generic Hip Hop beats.To me, this album is pretty much the same Mariah we heard back with Charmbracelet, and Glitter. I really was not happy with the purchase, and plan on returning the new CD when I can."
2,mariah's #1 fan!!!,"i have been a mariah fan since vision of love. this album is not good at all. Her voice is amazing as usual but the songs are just too ""today"", too ""bubble gum."" This album is no different than an Ashanti or Beyonce album. This album will not stand the test of time. I was very bored and disappointed with it. I will be a Mariah fan till the end but in my opinion Butterfly was the last good album she put out."
1,The Biggest Sellout in Pop Music History,"Jewel's last album was a sellout, but at least it is good. Mariah Carey is coming on 50 years old. Pretending that she is a 25 year old just doesn't work on this album. The worst track is ""We Belong Together"" in which ""Mimi"" overemphasizes each note and squeals like an out of control whale. I am a former ""lamb"" and woke up to realize that Mariah Carey doesn't have any true talent."
1,No More Please.,"I used to like Mariah, but at the point where she's released four versions of this album, I'm getting sick of her cashing-in on people. I feel sorry for the guys who have to buy all four editions just for the sake of completing their collection! Shine like the star you once were, Mazza!"
4,worth to buy if you're a fan.,it's always good to listen to her attractive vioce.all the hip-hop talents you'll meet in the cD.
4,LoVe EverY TraCk,"This ALBUM is goLden...hopefully it went Platnium! But besides that Mariah is back at it again with her TALENTED,UNiQUE and Soft voice that nobody else can mimmick or even dont reckon!==Tasha=="
4,happy with purchase,"I tried on several Smith helmets in the stores and I thought the Holt was most comfortable. I bought online due to more size/color options. The holt helmet keeps my head warm even in 20 degree weather when its snowing hard. It's simple design is what i like most about it, reasonably priced too. My Smith goggles stay secured to the Holt helmet just fine. I'd recommend this helmet to a friend."
1,I CAN'T Believe It,"Diddly-squat can't sing or rap. All he does is mumble and say ""Yeah,"" ""Uh-huh,"" ""C'mon,"" and ""Bad Boy"". He digs rhymes from out the trash can or gets ghostwriters to write his wack rhymes. He can't play any kind of instrument but samples song after song after song after song, etc. Diddy has NO talent but he has been able to amass himself a fortune by doing. . .what? I don't feel sorry for anybody who paid for this CD and discovered it was wack after listening to it. That's what you get. You should've bought Whodini. Throw this CD in the TRASH where it belongs."
2,DONT PRESS PLAY......,"Ok you already know, this album is full of collabos from Twista to my main girl Keyshia Cole. But this cd sucks. Yeah he got some tight beats to rock in the club to but thats it. My favorite track is LAST NIGHT feat. KEYSHIA COLE, That girl can blow, and thats makes the song tight, not Diddy. And like others have been saying, Yeah Diddy is a great business man and thats it. In my opinion he should just stay behind the scene's. Hang up the rapping Diddy, cause you are not it."
1,this Crow smells fishy,"[...] Also, some of ths songs sound re-worked to me in the vocals. Now I have no facts for this, this is just IMHO, but some of the songs the vocals sound tired and not like they did on the original cds. The vocals smell fishy, too. Like she had sung these songs so much, she just got tired. Or maybe I've heard them too much, my ears are tired.Also, the song selection. There are too many songs we know here. I would have liekd to see Sheryl select some rare cuts and ""B"" sides and such.Overall this would be a good collection for any other artist, but not for Sheryl. But if you don't own her four other ""proper"" cds get them then get this."
3,Why try to change a great song?,"I am a huge fan of Cat Stevens. I also think that Sheryl is a talented and beautiful artist. Occasionally, I have heard a new song by her and wondered at it's lyrical simplicity, knowing she is capable of so much more. I have a big problem with her cover of ""The First Cut is the Deepest."" I don't understand why she would cut the third line out of the chorus. I don't understand what this accomplishes. If that line hadn't been cut out, I know that I would have been thrilled with Sheryl's cover--she really does a beautiful job. But I'm so irritated by this change that I can't listen to her version anymore."
3,Mediocre,"I guess I'm not that big of a fan, however what I like I really like very much, in fact the only reason why I bought this cd is because I just had to have a couple songs on it. What I think it also boils down to is the fact that some songs were over played, spoiling my interest. Overall I must say I like her voice a lot and I like her style."
5,The Very Best of Sheryl Crow,"It is what used to be the best of Sheryl Crow; some of her new songs are even better, but how was she supposed to know that? It's a great CD and shows off Sheryl's versatility beautfully."
3,MP3 Download missing a track,"I'm lowering the rating for this album for the sole reason that the CD version comes with 17 tracks (Kid Rock duet being track 11). On the MP3 download album, that track is mysteriously missing. Not even listed in the track listing. Of course I didn't realize that until AFTER I downloaded. Sneaky and not fair to the consumer."
4,YES A GOOD ONE,"I have SC greatest together with live in Central Park and the DVD with the videos.My edition does not have ""Steve Mcqueen"" which one of my favourites.In general and after Amazon sent me all Sheryl's cds - Live at Buddokan is on its way - i can say that this greatest hits is a good one but if you can buy all of them it is FAR MORE BETTER.Be cause Sheryl is not an artist for having just a greatest hits cd and that's all!!"
5,all good songs,"I never realized I was a Cheryl Crow fan untill I listened to this CD. I made the mistake of letting my sister listen to it, and now I am on her to buy her one. You won't be dissapointed."
4,Only some of the very best...,"It goes without saying that any 'Best Of' collection reflects the indiviual preferences of the compiler(s). By commonly accepted standards, such a compilation is supposed to include (at least some of) the greatest hits along with some otherwise widely popular tracks. In addition, album tracks of lesser popularity are picked according to the aforementioned individual preferences. As far as my individual preferences are concerned, any Sheryl Crow collection that omits 'Sad Sad World' can by no means be entitled 'Best Of', let alone 'Very Best'..."
3,"Getting more and more dated but still the ""Bible"" for XML","Written in 2001 it's really starting to get dated with advances in many of the XML and related specs (not to mention new specs). But overall it's a good solid tome if you had to just have one but I'd prefer to have something more recent. That said it helped me pass my IBM developer certification for ""XML and related technologies"" in 2003."
3,A Good book to learn XML technologies,"The book provides good understanding of XML technologies and basics, but falls short on applying the technologies. I am an IT professional with wide experience in systems architect and design - and I was looking for a book which would give me an insight and more complete explaination to application of technologies. But this book is for explaning the technology and not applying it, as it falls short when talking about design and architecture requriements for open systems."
1,Simplistic Dud,"I do not doubt that the author can string together some sentences with the proficiency of an English teacher, but she is no storyteller. This is a sleeper and it is unbelievable to me that it has reached so high on the Amazon list. The story is a simplistic dud. Not much happens and that which does is as predictable as muggy weather in Silver Spring in the Summer. There is some character development and some interesting observations of a time past, but these are limited and are soon lost in the nothingness."
2,boring,"It started out well, but soon became very tedious and lost the story line. Don't waste your money."
2,Going Nowhere Fast,"What a sleeper! While reading, I kept thinking something was about to happen, something that would have made this book worthy of being an ""award winner."" Nothing did!"
2,"Slow-paced, go-nowhere dud!","Don't waste your time and/or money on this sleepy story. I was hoping for some redeeming quality of this book, but could not find it!"
5,Sim cityreview,"I loved your game. It was a very thoughtful game too. It was the only game that didnt make me Hyperventilate. I cant wait for the new sequel, ah, what is the name ofit, SIMCITY3000."
2,Nothing special,"EXTREMELY overpriced. They are just flags, nothing special except that they are a bit slimmer than the post it flags. Not worth it."
2,Enjoyable but nothing special,"Some great records pay homage to their influences by building upon the existing foundations in unique and artistsic ways. Ricchini's debut seemed to be on that track. It seemed like it was written by a man trying to seperate his sound from Belle and Sebastian and elliot smith. On his sophomore effort it seems Ricchini is struggling to find his unique voice. The songs are catchy and well constructed but are nothing more than grade a replications of better songs. If Bill wants to seperate himself from anyone he must make it a priority to be different. Some people will think this record is genius because it has pretty strings and horns; and while ricchini fluid piano playing and strong voice are the record's highlights, his songwriting has taken a step back."
1,Bill and sebastian,"This here is some of the most pretentious music I've heard. Hey Riccini, it's harder to be your own voice than it is to ride your influences coat tails. We get it. Your music is delicate and sweet just like a million other bands. Is anyone else getting tired of this self-important genre."
1,Poor,This book is not very good. The numerous authors attempt to cover too much in this book and as a result don't cover anything worthwhile. The book isn't well focused and has lots of mistakes.
4,"Wow, can't wait for the next one","I wanted to see more of the other original characters in this book like Crack, Mavis, The Doctor and the LC but they were all in the ""Origin in Death Book"". I really enjoyed the pace of the book and the ending."
2,Series Going Down Hill,"As a rule I will read anything Nora Roberts writes. I loved this series at the start but I am only continuing to read this book to find out why the family was murdered in the first place. Eve needs to lighten up. YES she killed her father. Yes she was abused and still suffers nightmares over the fact. But she has been with Roarke for two years and consulted with Dr. Mira so one would think that past history does not still haunt her 24 hours a day. And why is Eve still such a witch to Sommerset? Does Eve always get to be so hard and rude because of her horrible childhood? The writing at times is so terse - Your my cop. She's mine now, etc that does not ring true and is repeatitive. And where is the romance between Eve and Roarke? I did not like it and I say - let them have a child - maybe that way Eve will soften up and the writing will lighten up."
5,Lt. Dallas,"How she began, what she has done with her life and where she is going. Can't put the books down"
2,Thumping dumpings,"Upbeat party collaboration leaves one wanting, hardly providing anything involving besides a few occasional choruses that catch."
4,woaaa,"i just got this album today. I got ""popoganda"" first and thought it was pretty okay..okay enough to browse through this album, and boy this even better! I love this album! SOOO GOOD SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD! I can't stop listening to it!"
5,Essential for research!,"If one is doing research in Fairfax Conty on the Civil War, this book is a MUST!"
2,"Oops, Sorry I bought this one!","Sunny Baker has filled 328 pages with common sense and other information that should be obvious to anyone in the position to manage projects. Had I not removed the reference card out of the book upon receiving it, I would have returned the book for a refund. Thumbs down on the Complete Idiots Guide to Project Management. Two stars for the effort."
5,I really like the approach. A winner for those new to PM.,You really need to get this book--it's not a comprehensiveintroduction to PM--but it is a very practical one; the best I'vefound and I've been looking at a lot of them. Get it. Enjoy it. Love the quotes. It has a sense of humor--something the other books lack.
2,Very basic and somewhat outdated,"I was looking for a good introductory text to hand to our new project managers and this book got some great references from some of my associates. I got the book and knew in 5 minutes that it wasn't what I wanted. In retrospect I realized that the people who recommended the book were both in construction and both lived outside of the United States. If you work in a small company, with little to no infrastructure; where PM practices are primitive at best, I think this book would live up to it's reputation. If you, rather than your organization, are new to PM I would suggest getting James Lewis's Fundamentals of Project Management which Amazon also carries, instead."
4,THE SILVER KISS,"The Silver Kiss was a really well-written book. The story was perfect; it had all the right elements: suspence, horror, a little comedy, and romance. It was untouchable...until... The book, throughout, was written very poetically. Klause had a way of pulling the reader in much like the vampire in the story. The ending..(don't worry, I won't give it away) was completely anticlimactic. You expected something far more dramatic and heart-wrenching concidering the rest of the book.I definately recommend this book despite the fact that the ending was a total letdown. You will be sitting up in the middle of the night with a flashlight itching to find out what happens next. I couldn't put it down. I've never read a book so fast."
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited when I found this book at the library, thinking it would be somewhat like ""Look For Me By Moonlight,"" which is absolutely excellent. But I was very disappointed to find that after reading (and skimming), the first few chapters, I was so bored that I just said ""forget it,"" and probably picked up ""Look For Me By Moonlight,"" again. If you are interested in a suspenseful, romantic teen vampire novel with DETAIL, please choose ""Look For Me By Moonlight,"" instead of ""The Silver Kiss."""
4,silver kiss,this book didnt really do anything for me. i mean zoe annoys me when she lets simon into her house (he was creepy). i also did not like the ending mean her mom is going to die and simon dies... talk about depressing.
3,...,"I love vampire books so i thought this would be a good read, i was dead wrong. it's just plain depressing. it does keep you reading for a while because the plot has promise but then it drops off and leaves you feeling like you wasted your time. if you enjoy vampire love stories like twilight dont read this book."
3,Sliver Kiss,"I rated this book a three out of five becuase the book was kinda boring and wasen't that good. And I liked how the Author used it's word choice and the characters. But could have done alot better on the begining, middle and end. I also liked how zoe (which is the main character) did in the story. I advise people to read this if they liked mysteries."
5,"If you are a dreamer as I am, then you'll love this book.","Everyone I know calls me the Dreamer and Daughter of a yew tree. So on my birthday they gave me a lot of things, but I treasure my copy of 'The Silver Kiss.' I just love this book so much, I have now become obsessed with Vampires, as they have foretold. I thank the author everytime I read this beautifully sad book. I just wish I had a Vampire to call my own."
3,Was expecting more and got okay,"The story is a very good story, but that's all I can say about it. I read it in one reading and it was a very good read. But I felt the story had a lot of holes and that there was so much more that could have been told. I was left feeling a little empty. The story would have been much better if the love interest between Simon and Zoe was taken a little futher and not so rushed. The moral of the story about death and love was always going in the right direction but seemed to fall a little short. I would suggest this book if you are inbetween books are just looking for a quick good read. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great."
5,Always a hit,I've been wearing this scent since it came out. I have worn several others but I always come back to this one. It's always been a hit. My girlfriend loves it.
3,Drakkar Noir by Guy Laroche for Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,Okay fragrance. The scent doesn't last very long. I don't think I'll be buying ths product again. Spend a little more and get something that's worth the money.
3,"Funny, but irritating","I found this Discworld just as amusing as all the other early ones, but also annoying. Just like the notorious Simpsons episode set in Australia, this book confirms the lame old stereotype of Australians as beer-swigging bushies, shearers and hicks living in a big-ass dry desert. While it's true that some parts of the country are vaguely similar, it's very depressing how foreigners such as Pratchett lack the imagination to look further than that. With silly portrayals such as this on the market, it's no wonder that no-one takes my home country seriously. Pratchett, normally so wise and nonconformist, comes off as just another naive tourist with no real understanding of the country he's visiting. He does us a disservice by reinforcing the old G'day Mate cliches. The parts involving the God of Evolution were excellent, but the parts set on XXXX (a brand of beer in Queensland- how twee!) were just plain stupid."
2,Rincewind's a bit of a bore and hasn't Australia suffered enough?,"It's funny how the character that started the series remains my least favorite recurring figure in Pratchett's Discworld books. Rincewind is a one note character whose perpetual cowardice wears a bit more each time he appears. While ""Running away, keeps him alive,"" it also is unbearably predictable. Another difficulty with this one is that the too obvious Australia references read like a Monty Python skit that has gone on for far too long. This one's a throwaway in the series, for every good laugh there's about 50 pages of plodding along. There is an interesting Pratchett take on evolution and creation that brighten things up temporarily, but this pleasure is buried amidst what is easily one of my least favorite books in the series. It's rare that Pratchett writes one with little to recommend it, but The Last Continent fits that description all too well."
3,"Okay, but not great","This was funny, but far from Pratchett's best. He tried to cram too many jokes into one book, and didn't give any of them enough play! I would have loved a whole book with the Mad Max parody ... not fifteen pages or so."
4,DiscWorld Down Under!,"Another great Discworld novel, full of crazy insights [esp. in terms of Oz] and a great dose of humour."
5,"Not up to usual standards, but still a must-read!","Like most other people said, this book really wasn't as funny or sharp as Pratchett's usual books are, but some of the scenes and jokes were the best ever. They made the whole book worth it. I won't spoil it, but there was a scene with Ponder and the creator god which was just excellent. It's true, the book as a whole isn't really coherent and it doesn't really flow, but there are some sporadic scenes of brilliance that made the book worth it."
2,G'Day,"As an avid fan of Terry Pratchett I find it hard to give one of his stories a less than glowing report. Unfortunately with the last continent I am faced with either telling the truth or lying to myself that this book is anything more than just OK. I guess as an Australian I will be more picky about detail than other readers who are not as familiar with Australian colloquialisms but as other reviews here have stated the story meanders aimlessly and seems to only exist for the insertion of ""Ozzie Cliché's"". Pratchett like any good writer seems to have done a lot of research into his focus topic but missed one vital point that all Australians will see. ""G'day"" is only used as a greeting. He has Rincewind and other characters using it as a parting comment. The opposite of ""G'Day"" is ""Ooroo"" in the classical sense and today of course it is ""Seeya"". I apologize to Mr. Pratchett for being such a pedant but hey it's my country right."
2,WIZARDLY WOES,"As far as I'm concerned, panning Terry Pratchett is tantamount to blasphemy; I enjoy his writing and have recomended him to others. But ""The Last Continent"" was a tremendous disappointment. Rincewind stumbles his way to a plot resolution about five pages before the book concludes, and although this is usually the case his antics throughout the book had nothing to do with said resolution in this instance. The UU wizards are more one-dimensional than usual; with anywhere from six to eight of them involved in each scene it's difficult to identify with a particular one. A bright spot in the tale is the emergence of Ponder Stibbons as a legitimate character. His growth in the story is the only real development we see. ""The Last Continent"" is not the author's best effort; check out ""Small Gods"", ""Reaper Man"", and ""Men at Arms"" for true evidence of Pratchett's prowess."
5,Another amazing collection of Joe Kubert's work.,"I had never read a TARZAN novel or comic prior to this collection. The attraction for me was the legendary Joe Kubert. As usual, there is no disappointment in a Joe Kubert comic! Some truly beautiful illustrations within (especially the covers and battle sequences with wild animals). The first few issues are Kubert's retelleing of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan origin and then the collection ends with a few of Kubert's own tales of the King of the Apes. Great, great stuff and a beautiful book all around! I have already purchased a copy of the first TARZAN novel based on my enjoyment of these comics."
3,Nice throwaway Mouse!,"I liked it, I had 2 of them, eventually they brak inside the cord or something, but while it worked it was good, if you use it occasionally with a notebook, it's good, but not for daily use. I am sure that neither of mine came with a pouch, so I am not quite sure that this one will either."
4,Diamondback gets the job done,"This mouse offers a great deal of functionality in a good looking package. It has become my primary gaming mouse. Between adjusting the speed of the pointer on the fly, all the programable buttons, and the very nice response, not to mention it never goes into a hibernate mode (my other mouse will have a brief lag before responding if it sits still too long), this mouse gives you a little bit more of an edge in gaming. It isn't going to suddenly make you a pro, but it is a good piece in the puzzle to become very good. I still use my MS intellimouse for general surfing, but I use the Diamondback exclusively when I game.Pros:-Very sharp looking-Many programable buttons-Nifty features-Works for leftiesCons-Side buttons are inconveniently sized and located-A bit smaller of a mouse than I prefer"
2,Pretty but side buttons are painful,"The mouse had pretty glow, thinking it was for gamers it have more precission and be more comfortable to use. The mouse was very big compared to my small hands. Then there were things side control buttons were extremely painful that kept get in way making my fingers raw. I bought it and was only able to use it for day but I was too tired to return item. It has lot of fancy features but unless you know about things like macros,etc it is bit confusing to use."
2,Where's the rest of the music?,"Midnight Express has got to be the best film I've ever seen along with The Thing, Confessions Of A Window Cleaner and Dumb And Dumber. Unfortunetly, a lot of the perfect music from the film has been left out.Music genious Giorgio Morodor could have made this soundtrack great by at least including some of the orchestral versions of the Midnight Express Theme ( particually the final scene and where Billy tells his dad he loves him and is led away to prison ) but there isn't any.And the fantastic scene where Billy goes physco and kills Rifki has good music. But there is some of that music on track 7 heard in the background.Although not quite the same as the film version, track 1 is great, as is every other track on the CD but come on. 8 tracks?As I do for the James Bond soundtracks, I pray that a Cd will be released again with the other tracks on.<BR..."
1,This is not the original soundtrack,"I'm watching the Midnight Express movie right now. The music on this CD is not the exact music in the movie. It's the same melody, but played with different instruments. I want the music from the movie soundtrack, not an immitation. This CD sounds like a phoney synthesizer, but the music in the movie sounds more authentic and real. The theme song sounds like chimes in the movie, but on the CD it's completely different -- sounds like a synthesizer. Where can I buy the version from the movie?? DON'T BUY THIS DISC IF YOU WANT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MUSIC."
5,these should be stock,"i installed these about a year ago, should have done it 8 years sooner, completely transformed the brake feel and responsiveness for the better. while your gmc truck may not feel like a bmw or porsche it will have a much firmer pedal . highly recommend you get a motive pressure bleeder to help do the bleed after having all the lines open"
1,Edelbrock Poor customer service,"These brake lines do not fit an F53 RV chassis. The front lines are too short. Edelbrock will not answer their phone. The phone is in a constant ""busy"" loop. They do not publish the hose lengths making it impossible to know whether they'll fit prior to ordering. The fact that these do not fit has caused many complications in my business schedule and the RV owner's schedule for travel. Very BAD Edelbrock. For anyone looking for F53 RV brake hoses, Ford has discontinued them and they cannot be found anywhere. The hoses listed in aftermarket auto parts stores do not fit either as they are 6"" too short also."
3,"This book is good for a begineer,...code has mistakes","This book is good for begineers. It is very simple to understand and go through. The reason I gave it a 3, is because some important chapters on forms are completely incorrect. I had to go through websites to figures out the correct methods of implementing forms (posting)."
1,Carbon copy,"This book is almost a carbon copy of the ASP.NET using VB.NET version - even the photos of the authors are exactly the same. And as I flip through the chapters, they are virtually in the same order and have the same examples, though there are new sections dotted about here and there (the best written parts of the book IMHO). Personally I don't think that putting two near identical books out so close together is good practice. It speaks of cutting corners in order to make as much money as possible for the mimimum amount of work. ..."
1,not much substance,This was the third Elinor Lipman book that I have read this summer and this was the least interesting of the three. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Inn at Lake Devine' and 'The Way Men Act' but was bored with this one. I find it hard to believe that the Dobbin sisters waited until Harvey Nash came back into their lives to find any sort of excitment or romance. Since Harvey Nash had no redeeming qualities I found it difficult to care about his character.
1,I was very disappointed!,"I had often heard what a wonderful author Elinor Lipman is, so I picked the ""Ladies Man"" as my first book by her to read. The last 50 pages of the book, I had to force myself to finish it."
1,Silly and a waste of time,"I enjoyed Inn at Lake Devine and was looking forward to another good book. However, this was an extremely silly, pointless novel. The characters were shallow (especially the male) and totally uninteresting. I kept on reading it and hoping it would improve, but it didn't. What also made it uninteresting was the author's writing style of always using the present tense. I found this annoying after a while."
4,Screwball comedy,"This is my 4th or 5th Elinor Lipman book, and I always come back to her for something light, yet with enough depth to hold my interest, while being amusing. This one is probably the funniest of all I've read. Many situations and coincidences are laugh out loud funny, and the dialogue is witty.My only complaint would be that a couple of the plot elements are (I don't want to give anything away) are a bit of a stretch.This would make a great movie."
1,Defective Goods,"First day on arrival, i have tried to activate the scale like the instruction says, by simply tapping on the lower left or right side of the scale. But over and over in fustration i tapped , nothing happens. Then i even tried to get on and off it, and waited hours to see if the power might simply sync-in. -nothing again. I come to my final conclusion that this is a defective product. I do like the way it looks, but the opposite do i feel about the quality of this product. On a better note, Amazon was nice enough to send me a replacemeent the same day it arrived.- i do appreciate that."
2,Disappointing,Max Dimont wrote a great book about the history of the Jews. This book attempts to ride on the back of his previous venture--and fails in the doing. I was very disappointed in its shallow and biased reporting.
2,A DVD missing,"I go the whole package and i thought everything was fine until i got to the 10th DVD, only that it wasnt in there. They send me twice DVD 9 but DVD 10 was missing."
5,NEVER RECEIVED IT..,I ordered this collection from another seller..bait N switch...lost all my money..contacted them several times only to be told lies...I would have loved to get my hands on their necks..:) Its ok...I finally got them from AMAZON this past holiday season for cheap..
3,Faulty disks,"Don't waste your money. I love Friends but the quality of the video is just OK. (I've rented better quality at Blockbuster.) I've tryed playing them on multiple DVD and Blu-ray players and the images are just not sharp. Also there is a problem with skipping, almost every disk has at least spot that are unwatchable even with no visible damage."
1,horrible experience,Do not buy from this person!!! The cd's I received were scratched and the box was broken on one side. Also they did not respond to any of my emails for a refund!!!
1,HORRIBLE,NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH WHAT I BOUGHT. THE PRODUCT WAS PROMISED NEW BUT GOT USED AND SCRATCHED I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS GUY AGAIN NEVER .I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GUY .
5,How can you go wrong with Friends?!,"Bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it! The set is massive considering the extensiveness of how many episodes they filmed. It's perfect for killing time, on trips, or just to relax with. The DVD booklet that ships with the set is actually very nice! Pictures and stories from the cast/crew are fun to read and highlight some of the fun times spent filming the series."
1,Scratched discs won't play without skipping,"This set has disc holders made of heavy cardboard that WILL scratch the discs as you take them out and put them back. I just received this set from Amazon today, and the first disc I started watching was scratched and it skipped quite a bit. I'm shipping this back immediately. This packaging is very poorly designed.On a side note, the size of the box is also less than ideal. It's doesn't fit well with other DVDs on a shelf.I'm going to buy the individual seasons separately instead! The individual seasons are properly packaged with slim plastic disc holders. Plus, they are the size of other DVDs."
1,"Great Show, BAD QC!","I love the show so much. But this DVD set disappointed me! The package looks very new but once I opened it, finger prints and scratches on the discs were already there. The major problem is - only 18 discs out of the 40 discs in the box are 100% playable. I have returned the 1st set and now testing the 2nd set, seems the very same problem are still there. For all the Friends Fans: Don't buy it!"
2,Kinda Cheap,"There is no guide to tell you which episodes are on which disc. It's cheaply put together. The booklets that hold the cd's are flimsy, there are no pockets to put the cd's in, just cardboard tabs.Knowing what I do now, I would have just bought each season separately instead of purchasing this combined package."
1,Fingers crossed you don't have to deal with customer service,"According to Amazon, If you cancel your order with a company on Amazon Marketplace straight after placing it, it is your right to have it cancelled. Second Spin didn't share such enthusiasm and 2 days later, sent the item anyway despite numerous emails. When you consider the fact that I live in Japan and would have to wait a month for it to arrive, you can understand my indifference..The emails I received from the company seemed to be computer generated and served only to placate. I thought of phoning, but no phone number. I thought of writing, but no address.This is going to take up to 3 months to fix when all that was required was a bit of customer service.If you have a choice between companies, I think it may be wise to choose the other one - just in case."
1,Friends DVD,We ordered this product in August - it is October 14 and WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT !!! We attempted to check on its status and have found no way to have the problem resolved
5,Friends complete series box set,"I saved a substantial amount of money, almost 40%, compared to what it sells for at Best Buy."
1,Do not buy these!!!,These discs are completely worthless! Each one skips and pauses and makes it impossible to watch. I think they may be bootlegged! Do not buy these! Save your money!! They don't even have a list of the episodes!! What a ripoff!!!!
2,Nice Try,"It is a great idea to put all of the FRIENDS seasons into one series! I love FRIENDS, I think it is the best show ever made. However, this product was confusing and I am very surprised by the way it was put together. The discs were labeled by number of discs without any recognition of what Season is on it and what episodes I could find. Not to mention the fact that some discs had the end of one season and the begining of the next on it. There should have been some kind of order to the discs, as well as the season number on the discs so that I dont have to calculate disc 20 and what episodes will be on it and what sesaon that may be. I was very disappointed and I, therefore, returned this package. I refuse to have to look at the book every time I want to watch a specific episode."
4,Pretty darn happy,"This was not my first choice, but it was the less expensive choice. The box set is nice and colorful. All of the dvd's worked as long as I played them right away and didn't choose specific episodes. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,Very Upset,"I was very upset when I bought this! I'm only up to season 7 and half the disk don't even want to play in my dvd player. The packaging was horrible, they come in a flip like book in plastic sleeves and the package with Rachel on the cover was unglued from the back cover. The disk look like they are illegal copies passed off as new. Around the center there are glue marks and finger prints. I contacted the seller (dusteeshane) and was told that they were really sorry but they bought it off someone else so they had no idea if they were illegal copies or real. No refund was offered even. I'm looking at re-buying the series but am scared to do so now from anyone now not just amazon. Thinking about buying the seasons one at a time but not sure how to store them."
2,Friends: The Complete Series Collection,"I bought this same set - in China. I've no doubt that I did get the same set because, besides identical packaging, my wife and I encountered the exact same playback problems that many of you have talked about. In China, for what we paid, I can't complain. But I don't understand why a good quality set isn't available in the US market. ""Friends"" was a smash hit TV series. And yet I can tell you for a fact that this set is China market quality. Because we enjoy the show so much, we were planning to buy a set in the US from Amazon, until I read the reviews about all the disc problems (that my wife and I are already all too familiar with). I hope that in the future, Amazon will be able to offer a high quality set."
2,Hard to Read,"First, I am a professional Visual C++ developer and bought this book to learn the new .NET extensions. After working myself through the first two detailed chapters I am left with a lot of definitions but am wondering how or why I would use this information. Perhaps this might make a good reference book, I have no idea how accruate the informaton is, but it is not a ""primer"" in he sense that you buy this book as a self taught learning aid. I'm bored out of my skull."
1,the game didn't work,I did not get a chance to play the game b/c it was not compatible with my version of windows windows 7 I have ran across this a few times before all the new games for the most part work its when I try an old game sometimes they don't work not the fault of the seller its the operating system on my computer.
5,Major Minimalism,"The title selection is from Adams' opera, Nixon in China, but it has also achieved considerable popularity apart from the opera itelf. This CD is probably one the best collections of Adams' orchestral works, and anyone with an affinity for his work would find it a welcome musical library addition."
4,Luv this CD,"Ultimate Toni Braxton is a very good cd. I am a big fan of Toni Braxton, and I am so happy to have all of my favorite songs on one cd. This is a very mind relaxing cd, and every track is just awesome."
1,She sounds like a man!,"Toni Braxton is in my opinion the black equivelant of Cher, except not as many gay fans. My mom and sister both love Toni Braxton but I seriously dont see why. She is suited to a gay lounge at best. Un-Break My Heart was totally played out and so was Youre Makin Me High, He Wasnt Man Enough and Breathe Again. The rest really arent hits, just fillers. I am a Neptunes fan so I enjoyed the beats of Hit The Freeway, but the mannish vocals ruined it. There is a reason why Tonis albums are flopping lately: no one wants to hear from her no more. She cant sing... and she looks like a drag queen."
5,kokane rules,kokane is greatly influenced by george clinton and parliament funkadelic to understand kokane's style and his career I advise you to listen to all of george clinton's cd's kane brought the funk on this one this is better than anything snoop put out in the last few years west coast rap has'nt fell off kokane proved that wc's on 2 songs this gives it another 2 stars cause I love dub's flow a really funkdafied cd love every song.
5,"A dollar saved, an hour saved","Time is money, too. I've found Jacobson's books to be fruit-bearing, time saving investments without exception.But to each his own."
2,Not Much,Not much in this book that you can not get from the internet and other free sources. A dollar saved is a dollar earned-- should have just used info I got from the internet for free.
4,Like a journey,"An odd compilation that blends all the songs so there are no gaps in between - creating a disco journey, in a way. What fans should realise is many of these are not the original recordings. That's obvious I guess, to create the continous journey of the songs. Nevertheless, it works and presents an ideal CD for a 70's party. Just put it on, and start dancing.But - what do I have to do to find the original epic recording of ""Love to Love You Baby"" on a compilation?"
5,DISCO LIVES and DONNA SUMMER was the lifeline!,"Donna Summer may be known as the queen of disco but she also had hits in the 80s and 90s. The songs here highlight the hits that carried her through one of music's most exciting eras: DISCO. This is a dance album. No doubt about it.Unlike dance albums of today, this one sticks to the integrity of the original songs, even in extended versions which actually add to the life of the song. ""On the Radio"" opens and closes the album with 2 different versions. ""Enough Is Enough"" is the hottest track on the CD. Spanning over 11 minutes, it will kick you into high gear while you pick and choose which part you want to sing along with: Donna's or Barbra Streisand's.Memories, oh what memories. Snap your fingers and tap your toes. Dig up the old platforms. It's time to dance!"
2,In the Middle!!,"Hi its me who said the Rumble stunk and all that.This Review is for Backlash 2005.M1 Chris Jericho vs. KaneWinner=Chris JerichoM2 Christian & Tyson Tomko vs. Randy Orton & MavenWinners=Christian & Tyson TomkoM3 Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin IC TitleWinner=EdgeM4 Molly Holly vs. Jazz Women's TitleWinner=JazzM5 Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Ric Flair & Batista World Tag TitlesWinners=Rhyno & TajiriM6 Team Michaels (Shawn Michaels, Eugene & William Regal) vs. Team HHH (Triple H, Scott Steiner & Test)Winner=Team HHHM7 Goldberg vs. Chris Benoit World TitleWinner=Goldberg"

5,One of the best Raw PPVs,"Great Raw PPV for 2004, better than Judgment Day, infact almost better than the SD PPVs, this was just a great PPV"
5,Highly recommended!,"After 5 months with this product, we are very pleased. I purchased the aero queen mattress topper in August after much ""bed shopping"" without successs--my husband's needs in a mattress were different than mine. We wanted to try the air bed, with separate controls, without spending the $ for an expensive air bed. It has been great for us both, easy to set up, air up, and adjust individually. My back problems have improved, as well. We even tried it traveling where the bed was not comfortable, intending to place it on the bed there. Instead, we were more comfortable placing it directly on the floor, to our surprise. Now we have taken it traveling several times, just placing it in a suitcase, and off we go, assured of a comfortable bed wherever we are. Highly recommended."
1,American propoganda,"Although the book , as usual, holds your interest and is geographically well researched. Mr. White has little real knowledge of the actual political situation in Cuba or chooses to promote the right wing American version of the situation. The electoral system in Cuba is very similar to that of many municipalities in North America, except for the fact that citizens can recall elected officials. Mr White states that the poverty in Cuba is not caused by the American Embargo which also restricts other nations from trading with Cuba, . This is horse manure."
3,Nothing really new,"Firstly the tracklist for this single is:Friend is a Four Letter WordDariaNever Gonna Give You UpThe first two tracks are straight off of Fashion Nugget, while Never Gonna Give You Up can now be found on Bsides and Rarities and is a great song, usual deadpan cover over a top quality rythem section.Another single for the completeist, nothing new to see here if you already own Fashion Nugget and Bsides and Rarities, 3 stars for the songs themselves."
2,Cheap came apart right away,The stitching for the towel around the edges is cheap. The hood started coming off after the first wash. The wife fixed the part what was coming apart and as soon as she did that the rest of the hood started tearing. I love my little boy having a Chiefs towel but it is just a cheap quality.
3,i thought it would be different.,"i thought ""little cheifs fan"" and the logo would me embroidered. but its not. i dont know if it will last in the washer. looks like an iron on."
4,Interesting collection of early Steve Lawrence tracks,"I bought this CD recently , mainly to obtain Steve's version of the much-recorded standard "" Poinciana "" , and I was not disappointed. His version of this song is , in my opinion , easily the best of the many versions which I have heard ; I feel that Frank Sinatra's better-known version pales by comparison ! I would admit that the other 17 songs on this CD fail to match "" Poinciana "" , but I certainly like "" Mine and Mine Alone "" , How Many Stars Have To Shine "" , "" Tango Of Roses "" , and "" Sudden Fear "", and the musical arrangements on all the songs are interesting , intricate and very redolent of the early to mid 1950s."
3,An alright book for reference.,"They have alot of interupts listed in back, but you'd be better off with Raplh Browns current list as this one is outdated. Much of this book is outdated, Pentiums are not covered at all, and 32-bit instructions and operations are only covered in the Appendix. The book is not to bad but they do no cover much in the way of direct hardware access, one of the benefits of using assembly. There is almost no coverage of todays graphics cards, and sound cards are not covered at all. Overall it can be used as an outdated but good reference. Especially if you only need to program in Dos and/or 16 bits. But there are a couple of better books available. Beginers and Advanced programers should steer clear."
2,Too much theory. Not enough business.,"This is a great book if you are interested in writing a thesis on MTS. There is a lot of information which, frankly, most people will not use in the crunch of actually getting a project out the door. This is a frustration of mine with most of these books. In most cases, I am under pressure to produce, and what I hoped to get out of this book is:1. What will the different features of MTS do for me. Pros and cons. 2. How do I implement them. (with code examples)In order to get this info, I had to wade through page after page of theory, background and features which I will never use. This is nice if I were aspiring to become an engineer in the MTS division of Microsoft, but in this life I am trying to complete a project of which MTS is only one component."
2,This guy needs an editor worth his/her weight in salt!,"I purchased a hard-bound copy of this book, expecting a political thriller of Demille or Flynn quality. I haven't even gotten past Page 57 and I have been so distracted by spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors I feel like I'm in graduate school again proofreading an undergraduate's term paper! For someone with a resume of writing for NY Times and Boston Globe, teaching journalism, and co-owning a production company, this book is extremely sloppy indeed. I just hope that people don't put the entire journalism community in the same realm as this extremely poor journalistic endeavor."
4,Read ;this book... the White House did before deciding the new Afghanistan policy,This is a book that should have been written in the seventies... then at least the persons responcible for the the debical that was the Vietnam surrender could have paid for their poor and self driven choices... I only wish I had know about all of the background when I first entered the US Army in 1968...
2,history or hagiography?,"A Better War is not history but a hagiography of Gen. Creighton Abrams, who apparently could do no wrong. It is ""history"" as seen by the American mission in Saigon, with little attention paid to much else and what appears to be a deliberate attempt by the author to ignore unpleasant facts, such as the political pressures in the U.S. to withdraw and the appalling casualties sustained by the South Vietnamese in the Laotian invasion of 1971. The book seems largely based on tape recordings of Gen. Abrams, some of which border on the incoherent or at least the irrelevant, and which are quoted verbatim far beyond any reasonable limit - a good historian would have summed them up and quoted only what was significant regarding a given point.History? Sure, if your idea of a history of the Civil War would be Jefferson Davis' memoirs.(For credibility's sake, I spent two tours in Vietnam as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry Division.)"
4,intriguing,"Although the plot is rather disturbing at times, I found that I couldn't put Filth down. As always, Irvine Welsh has created fascinating characters and interesting plot twists."
3,Spoiled by daft political correctness,"Welsh has written what could have become an ""American Psycho"" for the late 90s (although there's less violence and more flatulence). The book's protagonist Bruce Robertson is an utterly hateful piece of scum & Welsh manages to build up an extreme aversion the likes of which literary characters rarely generate. This reaction stems from the fact that you are forced to see the world from the twisted point of view of a man who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. But then he spoils it all by trying to explain too much - a mistake which Bret Easton Ellis never makes. I'll give it 3 stars, for the likeable tapeworm's sake. Sometimes choosing a Schopenhauer quotation as your prooemium just doesn't account for everything..."
1,Excellent book,"I gave it one star cos ... hmm, i don't know, i guess it stands out from all the others though doesn't it? I actually think a lot of this book (the middle) is crap and he could have saved a lot of words getting to his breakdown thingie and ultimately, the last excretion of his life! Sound book and had i not have been looking for mere attention i would have given it say, hmm, 3.5 stars."
4,"Gritty, witty, filthy and loathsome, a good read!","Easily read once you get into the Edinburgh dialect. The main character is a repulsive police officer who abuses everybody and himself. If you liked Trainspotting you'll like this although it is a little more disturbing like some of the stories in Acid House.PS This is not what Scotland is really like, its just a story"
4,Compelling stuff,"A very strong novel with all of the usual Welsh character peculiarities. Not for the faint hearted, but Welsh fans will love it. A little bit more together than his other works (appart from Trainspotting) with a reasonably linear plot that never fails to shock. Also, it is easier to read, the accented text is not as tricky. Well worth reading but probably not as compelling as his previous works."
1,Wrox keeps getting worse.,"I was hoping this would be the sequel to the awesome beginners asp database book by John Kauffman. It was not even close. This book trys to cover so many platforms that it ends up not covering anything very well. The examples are terrible and confusion will set in after the second chapter. I have found that with Wrox books, if there is more than one person on the cover, then it will stink up the place."
5,Funniest movie EVER.,"This movie was designed to make fun of every monster movie, every horror movie, every bad B-movie ever made. Along with the tons of humor there are also some serious messages about journalism, commercialism, and politics. But mostly it is about giant tomatoes, song and dance numbers, old fashion cars and characters nobody cares about.You'll never look the same way at a fruit again. No wonder it had so many movie AND cartoon spin offs. Great theme song!"
3,Atack of the Killer Tomatoes - light-hearted humour,"The movie was obtained for my adult daughter who had seen it many years earlier and had always wanted a copy.We watched the movie and I found it to be very entertaining.It is a farsical, rock-bottom budget, science-fiction movie that is so corny it is quite funny.The very basic and often clumsy special effects add to its enjoyment.It is a good-fun movie with a plot that shares simplicity with lots of other '50s and '60s sci-fi stuff.While I doubt the movie would appeal to a wide audience, I consider that anyone who can relax their expectations and preconceptions would get a good laugh out of the movie."
4,Excellenet Silly Camp,"This is one of the best original silly camp movies made. As a spoof of horror fiction, it does not merely mimic an existing popular movie, it creates its own scenario and then runs (wild) with it."
1,Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" certainly got a tremendous amount of mileage out of only one joke. And that one joke, as Leonard Maltin accurately noted, gets ""beaten to death for another eighty-five minutes."" I suspect that the ""star"" of this film had to have been genetically altered because, for all of its hype as a hilarious ""cult classic,"" this tomato is a real ""lemon."" Don't waste your time, or your money."
4,"Cheesiest Movie Ever! And there's nothing wrong with that, if it makes you laugh your gaboons off. Some of the bits are on the","Cheesiest Movie Ever! And there's nothing wrong with that, if it makes you laugh your gaboons off. Some of the bits are on the lame side. (Mason Dixon's sidekick was my least favorite character.) But with the fast pace of the film, another bit will be along in a minute. I do not know how I missed this in theaters, but every time I saw clips, I thought they were hysterical. I finally got the DVD, and it was worth some solid laughs.I was surprised that there was minimal additional material-only the trailer."
3,"Not a great movie, but I love it.","Acting, writing, production values, all horrible. But it's still pretty funny, and for some reason I keep watching it over and over. I've also started keeping a suspicious eye on my ketchup bottle."
3,Would have been good... if I hadn't already played BG & BG2,"Icewind Dale is a late, late comer to the Mac. If you absolutely need a novel BG/BG2 type fix, okay but as a game it takes a step back from BG2."
2,"Some useful information, but more errors and ommisions",I bought this book because I needed an ASP.NET reference. This book seems a bit schizophrenic. Part of it is tutorial and parts are reference. I haven't used it as much as I had hoped because I have run into several major errors.ExamplesLists System.Data.ODBC when in fact this should beMicrosoft.Data.ODBCAlso forgot to mention the part about having to download it from MS website.Lots of errors in ADO sections in general. I have tried several pieces of code from the book that simply don't work.I certainly don't recommend this book.
2,Disappointing Dub,This was my first shot at trying to find dub music that I like. I found this cd to be very repetitive and FAR from organic sounding. The tracks are uncreative and long. I wanted more of a reggae sound and this just sounds more like lounge trip hop.
4,Tasty is pretty good,"I am a big fan of Kelis ever since her debut in late 1999. I was one of the lucky ones in the U.S. to get her 2nd project ""WanderLand"". That one was also a solid album. This new project entitled ""Tasty"" is just that. It's like a box of Chocolates and when you bite into each track, you get something different everytime.My favorite track and choice for next single is ""Protect My Heart"". ""Protect..."" is a very straight forward dance track that should be a club and radio favorite. I could'nt stop playing it. ""Millionaire"" featuring Andre3000 of OutKast is influenced by early ""pre-Purple Rain"" Prince and sounds as if it could've been pulled from his ""Controversy"" or ""1999"" sessions. I also enjoyed Raphael Saadiq's contributions ""Glow"" & ""Attention"". Over all this should be a decent seller for Kelis."
4,Tasty- one of the more enjoyable albums in 2004,"This album is pretty hot. It is in constant rotation in my car. The Ralphel Sadiq produced cuts (""Glow"" and ""Attention"") are one of the best on the album. Reviewers have missed the boat when calling this a dance album. Actually, it is closer to a Neo-soul album (Like Vivian Green, Erica Badu). Kelis takes a lot of chances with her music, and it shows on cuts like ""Public"" (with future hubby NAS)and ""Milkshake."" ""Sugar Honey Iced Tea"" is another cut that is sure to have one grooving in the car. Also, Millionaire with Andre 3000 is simply off the hook. All around great album!"
5,"R&B, Pop, Rock, radio flavor","Tasty made me like red a little more. Carrot tops everywhere beware of the lure! Mischievious attitudes are welcome to explore the mildly restricted lyrical combination of verbal basting. It's delivered in the classical Kelis voice of sexilicious. A true hot mess of vittles with 14 opportunities to identify with Kelis in song. Buy or listen and get to know yourself through Tasty eyes with raised brows feel Kelis' shocking love. Fresh with today's comtemporary pop rock flavor. The only kind of vibe that's hot in the summer and cozy warm in the winter. You'll love it too. Get into rhythm, so you can get ya dance on!"
3,Tasty? Not quite.,"This was a decent album. Nothing to RAVE about. But I do enjoy the milkshake song quite a bit and also ""Trick Me"" (is that the name of that song?) is pretty darn good. So... if I averaged the really good songs with the not so hot songs I would give the album a 5 out of 10. Hence, the three star rating. But to each his own!"
1,One word....Boring,"I really dont understand some of the reviews. There is only one song on this album that is worth listening to. I'm not even going to say which it is because its obvious. Overall, this is just plain bad."
2,Not good music,"I give this CD 2 stars, rather than 1 star, simply out of respect for the recording-quality itself. Unfortunately, it is an excellent recording of unfortunate music. My recommendation is: Buy this CD only if you like harsh, edgy, dissonant jazz. Mapleshade does offer some excellent jazz CDs that you should check out, including Harold Ashby's ""Just For You"", as well as Fernandez's remarkably good ""Melodia Para Congas."" The C.I. Williams CD and Clifford Jordan's ""Live at Ethell's"" are also excellent."
1,very poor performance,"I bought this system in Jan 2011. It worked for the first few months but recently it has stopped providing rainfall info, wind speed and the outside themperature reading is suspicious. I've changed batteries and find the manual next to useless.Other than that the screen looks impressive and the blinking lights are quite entertaining. For the money they charge, I'd pass on this unit."
1,"Simplifying is one thing, wrong is another","It's fine and good to write simple books for kids, but there's a difference between simple and wrong. For example, African drumming was not banned in some slaves states, it was banned throughout the South except for in New Orleans' Congo Square. The second line doesn't accent ""the rhythm in such a way that it sounded as if the players were playing in 2/4 time"". And voodoo rituals were not one of the ""most popular events"" in New Orleans ""attended by both whites and Africans"". And this is the first half of the first chapter! Why is this writer getting published? This is an irresponsible book; a child would actually be dumber after having read it."
2,servlets w/out databases,"the only way to get source code for the examples in this book is to download it from their web site. no problem, except that they don't offer the source code for all the examples, because the database examples don't work. there are no drivers, and there is no explanation of where to get them. don't count on this book to help you get connected to a database from a java servlet. it won't help."
4,Heavy on Examples,This book is heavy on examples and light generic explanations of Java Server Programming. It is obvious that it was written by a group of authors because the writing styles and whole focus changed from one chapter to the next.
4,Good Book to start Server Side Programming,Good Book to start server side programming. The logical arrangement of the chapters are not good.
2,"A lot of subjects, none in depth...","This book covers a lot of the technologies of Server-side Java application development. However, it doesn't cover them in depth to make this book the reference in any of these technologies. Another drawback, is the work and difficulty involved in setting up the software products necessary to replicate the environment used in the book, which is not covered at all in it.Buy this book only if you're trying to get a single one-shop coverage of these topics. Don't buy it if you're looking for comprehensive coverage of Server-side Java technology (actually, you'll need several different books for that)."
1,save your money!,"I bought this item based on price, how can you go wrong for 10$ for a programable coffee maker? Well, you get what you pay for. after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks, it just stopped working! Just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item! based on the rest of the reviews, I just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee. lesson learned.treehouse"
4,coffee pot,This product recieved before expected. It works great. I read several bad reviews about it after ordered but found that none of those were true. We love ours.
2,Just a tiny step up,"This case is just a tiny step up from the simple black sleeve that comes with the iPaq. I might even end up going back to the old sleeve, because it's slimmer.The case has a hole in the clip where you're supposed to be able to attach the USB cable, but the cable head doesn't fit so it's always coming out. So to synch the iPaq with my PC, I have to remove it from its case.The case looks cool, but that's about all it does. I'm wishing I'd gone for the leather case, and I don't recommend this one."
4,light fixture,"good product, good price, goos service. this is too much work to rate this purchase. you need use a quicker system!"
5,Unappreciated Gem,"I came across this film several years ago at the local video store when I randomly selected it. I had never heard of it before and I wasn't expecting much. Boy, was I in for a surprise.This is a brilliant portrayal of a racist redneck and his ultimate downfall. However, this is no mere morality tale, as the movie never manages to take itself too seriously for that. The overall feel of the flick is that of a dark comedy.Whats truly amazing about this movie, is that is real low tech - literally, yet it manages to be so powerful, in spite of this. No masked crusader spinning webs, no car chases, no plane crashes, no pyrotechnics, nada. All the action (if you can call it that) revolves around this one deeply flawed individual, a retro telephone and a compulsive caller whose performance brings to mind the 'Jerky Boys' comedy sketches that were once popular.Go out, buy this one. I guarantee you won't be dissappointed."
2,Fidji,"I have used Fidji for many years when it was readily available at most department stores. This product was a disappointment in that it did not seem to be the same scent,....close, but not quite right."
4,This Album BANGS,"This Krafty Kuts mix is very positive & upbeat (as you might expect) and I was suprised to find that it's much more housy than some of the more traditional Hip Hop mixes I've heard from him. If you like Krafty Kut's style you won't be dissapointed. As for the other CD, it's good but I can't tell you much about it - I've got too many of the Krafty Kuts trax stuck in my head to think of what it sounds like."
5,eerie beauty,i'm not a fan of a cappella.usually i think 'it needs a guitar here' or 'drums are needed' etc. but NO WAY in this case. the voices hold all the cards on their own. i'm often turned away from vocals if theres a bit of pretention taking away from the music. but NO WAY in this case.these village women are REAL. they FEEL all of their music. so beautifully scary and tuneful.10 out of 5.
4,Lyrical work,"Reich often provides his listeners an inward journey, but this journey on different trains tells a story. The liner notes tell of his riding trains in the United States back and forth between family and parallels the events happening in Europe during World War II. It is strongly affective.Too, the Pat Metheny performance on this work is lyrical, and though I was first a Reich fan before I fell for Metheny's work, I think that Pat has imparted some wisdom for Steve in changing this work to be more ""idiomatic"" of the soul of the guitar.One of my favorite Reich albums."
4,Just what I wanted,"The Power of Impossible Thinking by Wind and Crook was just what I was looking for in terms of getting a better understanding of mental models and how they impact decision-making. I am not so much in the inspirational and aspirational components of the book, but it adds valuable perspectives for those in the business of leading innovation in their work situations. Understanding why people don't get on board with great changes is challenging. There could be so many things - the proposed change is just not good etc; but if your people are viewing the change through particular lens that ""color"" everything they see, and even shape what things they do actually ""see""; then a lot is explained, and ways of addressing that deficit can be worked on."
3,Basic Advice,"I think the title of this book is a bit of an over-reach. While this book does have some good, basic advice, it is certainly nothing revolutionary and is not going to transform either my life or my business."
5,Small Business Owners Should Read this Book!,"This book really helps you to see how skewed we all view certain things and events in our lives. It also helps you to learn new ways of seeing things, that before my have been holding you back without you even realizing it. I would recommend this for anyone who owns a business, or has a managerial position within a company."
1,Less than satisfying,"If you want to read some good philosophical work on ""Thinking"" and/or ""Perceiving"", then this book is certainly not it!This 'pseudo-philosophical' discourse is regurgitating a lot of Descartes' mistakes. Unfortunately, this book lacks the dramatic, albeit logically flawed, effect that Descartes achieved with his famous 'Cogito, ergo sum'.I could find nothing in the book that lived up to the expectations created by its very teasing title. Most of the content of this book reminded me of nursery school, not business school."
5,A Recommended read for EVERYONE,"I really liked this book. My friends typically consider me as a very positive person, but this book made me examine how even the little things that I do in my life affect people around me. This book provides very thorough mental frameworks for day to day life to recognize the positive in yourself and others. This is the book that I will use in everyday situations. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a more fulfilling life. I truly enjoyed it."
5,a very compelling management book,This book is a must read for executives. I appreciated the scientific approach taken by Jerry Wind and Wharton School Publishing. They obviously spent an enormous amount of time gathering data to support their conclusions. This book has given me a lot to think about in terms of how I run my business. A must read for professionals everywhere.
5,The Power (and Dangers) of Impossible Thinking,"The reviews are mixed regarding this book. I really liked it. I have seldom seen a more logical and thorough writing. I couldn't recommend this book highly enough. I found it to be a highly entertaining and thought-provoking survey of the mental models behind our decision-making. I read through Power of Impossible Thinking in one day. I was simple unable to put this book down. I found myself relating all of the stories and the findings to my colleagues. It is simply that compelling. I found it to be the most enjoyable and informative book I've read this year.I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Mr. Wind at a book signing for Power of Impossible Thinking. After hearing him discuss some of the topics in his book, I'm ready to read this book for a second time. I anxiously await the next topic he chooses to tackle for his next book and I highly recommend the Power of Impossible Thinking."
5,Best and rare songs of LAM!,"This compilations of rare,live and best tracks of LAM is really great!Try this CD!"
3,Good Show,"A little better than so-so. I have terrific CDs of their performances, but this DVD was a disappointment.Not well staged. Did not capture the energy of the performance compared to the quality of the CDs."
3,better at beginning,"I liked the book's first one hundred pages a lot. The characters were very interesting, and there were turns that I did not expect. However, the end was pretty boring; in fact, I am not too sure what happened there because I lost interest. Great book for airport or beach reading."
1,Mac Davis: The Very Best and More,"I really only bought this CD for the song ""Oh Lord It's Hard to Be Humble""....a great, funny song. The rest of the CD is is - for my taste - too pedestrian ""country"". I was bored by it."
4,Good resource.,I bought this book after reading the good reviews on-line. The book provides good background of various drinks and even helps you do create your own.
5,This is THE BOOK,"I'm surprised that this book doesn't have more reviews - I am usually too preoccupied or lazy to take the time to write Amazon reviews, but in this case I had to speak! This really is THE BOOK if you're looking to learn the art of mixology, the craft of the cocktail, the joy of boozing it up in a delicious and debonair way! I am rather obsessive with the whole mixing drinks thing - and an obsessive buyer of cocktail books - but the only two that really matter - the only two that are ESSENTIAL and not just a novelty to own - are this book and Dale Degroff's the Craft of the Cocktail. Buy others if you have the inclination, but if you're wondering what to buy to learn, or to enjoy, or to be able to say you have the definitive books on the subject - buy those two. And believe me, I've tried out enough of the recipes to KNOW what I'm talking about!"
3,Meh... not really fragrant enough,"I ordered this box and another scent. At first, I thought the sticks were a little small, but they last 20-25 minutes each which is good. The scent isn't very strong from what I'm used to in other incense and it also does not linger after burning. If you want to get a good aroma in the air with these, use two sticks and ""chain burn"" to keep up the smell. You'll go through a lot of sticks, but at least the aroma is nice."
3,Quality incense.,"Wonderful incense company, just not the right fragrance for me. I was expecting more of a pungent amber (like the kind they use at Catholic high mass), but this one is very sweet. I personally prefer Nippon Kodo's sandalwood and their pine incense much more."
4,Good Wakefield twins drama but..,"""All Night Long"" is the fifth book in the Sweet Valley High series. In this chapter, Jessica spends time with an older man, Scott Daniels, who ends up putting Jessica in an uncomfortable position by taking her to this all night beach party and tries to take advantage of her. Jessica doesn't come back home the next morning, which concerns Elizabeth. The readers are a little unclear about how Jessica was able to get back home and the next time we hear from Jess, the book is almost over, Elizabeth has taken a test for Jessica and had a huge fight with Todd. I feel like this book is pretty rushed. I really enjoyed the first half of the book where Jessica is in a unfamiliar place with Scott, I felt like the readers deserved some more detail about that night. A quick read, but not one of my SVH favs."
5,!!!Second Best!!!,"Please dont get me wrong with the above statement. The Twins Trilogy is one of the greats of all dragonlance material ever. It was second in my collection only to the Chronicles Trilogy. But if your like most and have been intrigued by either Raistlin, his brother Caramon or just the magic of Krynn alone then get all three of this I promise you wont be dissappointed!"
3,Stick with it!,War of the Twins was just as dissapointing as Time of the Twins. It was depressing and lacked everything that made the Chronicles trilogy such a sensational bestseller. The only good part was when Raistlin burnt the village. The only reason worth reading this for is so that you can understand everything that happens in Test of the Twins (the only good book in the trilogy)! Stick with it and soon you'll be enjoying 'Test' - the dramtic conclusion to this other wise dull and depressing trilogy
5,love her music,i love all her music because i'm old school her music was in the clubs back in the day's with the sliver ball in the clubs her music will live on 4 everi'm going 2 buy some more of her music soon as i got her cd i downloadied it 2 my p.c.
2,only 2 good songs,"This cd only had 2 good songs on it.....although, if you grew up on her songs and they meant something...then you might feel differently....but for me the whole cd is boring. I'd rather download 2 songs on mp3"
1,"Don't buy this, unless looking for historical information.","This book is based on Copland, the planned 'next generation' operating system that was scrapped in late 1996 or early 1997. It has nothing to do with the Mac OS 8.0, which was released in '97. Its an entirely different product.If you are interested in what -could have been- had Copland not been scrapped, this is the book."
2,A bit disappointed,"While I admire the author's sincerity, I found the writing to be bogged down with righteousness and preachiness. His writing relies more on quotes than speaking from the heart. I thought the exercises were useful and wished there were more of them. I had hoped for a much deeper and more personal exploration into my own Shadow."
1,"Can I give it ""0"" stars?","You know a book is bad when EVERYONE in your book club, regardless of political, spiritual or social background unanimously hated it! (With the exception of the person who picked the book, who is now believed to have some mental defect). The only positive thing we could agree on was that the ""concept"" was good... but that was it. It had waaaaay to many characters, the writing was confusing, no doubt due to the fact that there are 2 authors, most of the storylines are completely ridiculous, and by the end you wish everyone had just died upon impact. No one was worthy of survival.The story takes place right where I live, so from a personal perspective I could appreciate the location, I knew where the towns and freeways were, but beyond that I have nothing but contempt for this book. It is now just hours of my life I will never get back."
3,Dated but a Good Read,Good character development with several different story lines. If you don't mind historically dated material (pre-the fall of the Soviet Union and the advent of the Space Shuttle)... still timely and plausable story of the effects of a major comet strike on the earth and civilization.
3,The book was tedious for the first 350 pages,"I read the reviews of this book prior to buying it. It has been reviewed so much that I won't go into the details of the book. However, I want to say that the first 350 pages (the book is 600+ pages) of this book were tedious in character building. I had to gloss over a lot of none essential dribble that was so annoying. The book could have been condensed down to a total of 400 pages. Better books to read would be ""Patriots, Surviving the Coming Collapse"" or ""One Second After."" Both of those books have their flaws but were page burners and recommended!"
4,Good Story - A little dated,"My mom put me onto this book a few years back. I decided to read the book after mom told me how wonderful it was and how much it had made her think. I read the book(which happened to be published the year I was born), and found the story very interesting, but the understanding of science was a little bit quaint. They were still arguing about whether the moon landing was a good idea or not. The story, a meteor hitting the Earth and ""ending the world"" was very good, and I believe, well thought out."
5,I'm speechless,"I am truly without speech. 5 stars isn't good enough to describe this book, and I'm certain I can't do it justice with my own words either. Just read it."
2,SOOOOOO SLOOOOW,"I am very glad I read these reviews before I bought this book because I know I would have given up in about 50-60 pages. It is so tedious and so boring the author really must have had to work at it. I actually placed a marker at 200 pages so I could encourage myself that I didn't have that far to go. I am proud to say that I made it, so now I'm ready to actually enjoy the book! I probably have no business rating it yet, but I'll come back after I'm done and update the review.Okay, I've finished the book and it's actually much better than I rated it when I began. I'll have to rewrite the review because it will not let me update the star-rating, to which I now give the book 4 stars. I just encourage you all to keep on reading past that 200-page mark, 'cause it does get fascinating, trust me and the thousands of other folks who have read and loved this book!"
2,Interesting Concept; Disjointed and Poorly Written,"Once the hammer begins to fall (around page 170), the plot, sociology, and science become interesting. However, this interest does not sustain, especially through the poorly written pages. The characters are flat, difficult to decipher, and terribly written. The novel is an exceptionally slow read due to the wooden dialogue and disjointed characters and action sequences. The concept and science in the story are bafflingly believable, though."
2,"The end of civilization, or rather California","I'm not thrilled with this book. It sounds like the script for a mindless blockbuster movie with no philosophical depth. Most of the ""heroes"" are simply people who luck out, find a way to survive, and are too greedy to share it with anybody else, who get cast as ""the villains"". And it's hilarious that damage to the coasts is equated with the end of civilization; don't they realize that most of the U.S. (the ""flyover states"") would still be there? The only really impressive scene is the one with the honest jail warden who realizes that his prisoners are helpless and has to decide on his own which ones deserve freedom or death."
4,A Hard SF Look At Disaster,"""Lucifer's Hammer"" delivers on everything most ""apocalpyse tales"" promise, and offers a wonderful deal of realism to boot. No angels or demons are requried here, just the courge and failings of the human race.Niven and Pournelle truly capture the characters they create, each one unique and believable. The actions of these characters drive the story to logical, and sometimes tragically inevitable, conclusions.Possibly the only drawback comes from one or two improbable coincidences, but these can be forgiven in such a masterwork."
4,A great destruction epic,"This book had a lot going for it. Niven and Pournelle, with m,uch scientific experience, have created a very realistic story. Calling it sc-fi would almost be a stretch, since it could really happen. The characters were very complex and memorable. The aftermath of it all, however, seems to be smaller in scope when compared with the destruction area of the book. When this aftermath begins, the books does begin to drag later on. After 640 pages, though, I was glad I read it"
3,Lucifers Hammer,Good Book however it is extremly slow in getting to the true story line. The first 100 pages are nothing but background.
2,GOOD BOOK/BAD BOOK,"The book itself is great, I have read it before. But the actual book is a mess. Every time I turn the page it falls off in my hand. I have a ""bookfull"" of loose pages!!"
2,Very disappointing.,"I have read other books about survival after a catastrophe, but this one I didn't like too much. They needed to have more tell and less show, more politics and less sex/relationships, more guts and gore and less character development. Suffice to say, this wasn't The Stand, wasn't One Second After, wasn't even The Patriot which manages to have a fascinating story in spite of it reading like Popular Mechanics.One more thing, the reviewers who complained about racism are wrong. The topic of race was handled fairly because it showed that racism can and does exist from ghetto blacks against whites, and from some whites against blacks. The Stronghold itself wasn't racist and nobody was kept out due to race."
5,Great!,"Long before I saw Deep Impact, I read this masterpiece by Larry Niven and Jerry Puornelle. As good as that movie was, this book was at least 10 times better!This is one of the best end of civilization books I have ever read (better than When Worlds Collide and Earth Abides). Shows how some people will turn into savages while others will try to keep the society going. So realistic, you feel that it actually happened."
2,Please direct people in bookstores to other disaster novels.,"WAY too outdated. The book is all 70's, and glorifies sex. The characters are believable, I suppose, but half of them die anyway. Starts out boring, then finally gets a heartbeat, but then you have to cover it with a sheet. Unrealistic after the comet's impact.Some people thought 'Deep Impact' was a bad movie because it stayed directly within the United States. 'Lucifer's Hammer' doesn't take a step beyond Los Angeles, except when telling of space scenes or the comet's destruction.Don't buy this book. There are better ones."
5,Everything you could want,"Bought mine on a pre-order in November. It's very fast, multi-tasking is a non-issue; the built-in TIVO is a great toy. Once you read email and watch TV at the same time, you'll never go back. Click to DVD is very easy to use. Comes w/ a multitude of video, photo and jukebox software so you can pick your favorite.Using a remote to control your music, view photos & video is WONDERFUL!Sound quality is very good w/ supplied speakers - volume goes very high.Cons:Even tied to a great monitor, do not expect the TV picture to be as good as your set in the den.My DirectTV receiver doesn't mesh perfectly w/ the TV tuner so that on some channels I have to hit a button on the Cable TV remote to remove the menu screen. More fiddling needed there.The built-in mem stick port shows up as a CF port - strange.Pluses greatly outweigh the minuses. A new version has the whole thing built into the monitor, so no box. Would be even better."
1,Bad design on clip,"I have owned two of these bags. The first bag broke 4 miles into it's first ride. Amazon warrentied. The second one broke 3 months afterwards. Both broke along the clip area of the top of the bag. Really bad design.In the past, I have loved Topeak products, but not with this product. Seems the clip cannot withstand a load of a tube, plastic tire tools, a hex wrench and a CO2 cartridge.Bought an Eleven81 bag with the clip to replace the product and have been very happy. The clip mounts easily, and is stout! Simple mounting with hex screw and has a metal backing where it attaches to the seat. Good quality bag as well. Where the Topeak would rub my legs from under the seat, the Eleven81 does not. The only difference I have found is that the Topeak has a net area on the fold our area of the zipper and the Eleven81 does not.Buy the Eleven81. Don't buy the Topeak."
4,Outstanding but dated,"Great book on nuclear terrorism that I first read when published 32 years ago. Still very interesting and well researched, but the World Trade Center is gone, Qudaffi is dead and Carter is no longer president."
2,Doesn't seem like what the back says,"I picked up this book in a bookstore since I like the tough, hard to reach characters and read about randomly maybe twenty pages before putting it down in disgust.It wasn't because the story or writing was so horrid. But Egg is a sixteen year old girl and manages to get drunk, swears maybe ten times (I'm probably off, but not by much) in one chapter and did not seem a very respectable sixteen year old but more like a rebel. In the first chapter when she meets Max, she debates about whether Max smells nice or smells bad before deciding that Max smells bad. Just the way it was worded made me think that she was not as boy proof as the author makes her out to be. and gave a very strong impression of being a stupid book.It might be a perfectly fine book, but it is not something that I would ever read."
1,Totally out of date - it's based on Beta 2!,"This book was published in Dec 01 which means it was written using .NET Beta 2. It is now completely out of date and many of the examples just don't work. To be fair, there is an ""Update"" document available for download from Wrox but wht not just buy an up to date book in the first place. My recommendation is ""Applied XML Programming for Microsoft .NET"" by Dino Esposito, # 0735618011."
1,????,this guy and his dips**t crew could possibly be the worst rappers in history. they have a fake ass image of wannabe gangstas. all their songs sound tha same. why cant juels wacktana and camwrong stop making music and just dissapear and take that sorry dipset crew w/them
2,A very NOT GOOD book to enter C#,"I've read a book of Wrox ""Beginning Visual Basic"". The author was very detail and organize (Peter Wright) that I decide to get another one from Wrox.I made a bad choice. The Beginning C# made me confuse with the messy context and explaination. The examples are not explain in detail at all. I had a hard time following the example because as a beginner in C#, I need to know what code to go where, and what does this line means. This book does a very bad job of that.I feel very frustrated that I decide to put this message to help new reader who plan on buying this book. Good day."
3,A cute collection peice for people who really love the novel,"This is the graphic novel (comic book form) of Tanith Lee's novel The Silver Metal Lover, whitch to me is the greatest book ever writen (and trust me, I've read A LOT of books, although I really don't like anything else by Tanith Lee, its just not the same). The drawings in this interpritation by Trina Robbins are not exquisite, but, its nice piece to own for big Silver fans. She drew Silver in a way that was not at all what I expected him to look like (I expected him to look more like the robot on page 16) and a lot of the story is cut out. I would reccomend to hold off on getting this item until you have read the book by Tanith Lee, because it's not as fufilling and if you read this one first it will just spoil the ending."
3,Strap too wide,"I have this bag in dark red/red. PERFECT size, love the two inner pocket spaces for cell phone etc., and I love the zippered compartment. Loud velcro closure would be great for anti-theft, but I'd rather have a magnet closure and zippered top underneath. The strap on this bag is making me think I might need to return it. The strap is way too wide and cuts into my neck when I wear it as a cross body bag which is why I purchased it."
3,A nice gem to add to your collection,This is a nice little movie to add to the collection if you are a fan of the older style martial arts films as I am. Definitely a bargain and not a waste of a few bucks. A similar plot seen before featuring revenge. A guy repeatedly goes after the martial arts masters who pretty much cripple him each time he attacks them. What's weird about this one is you're kinda glad the punk keeps getting his butt kicked and has to be taken home in a wheel barrow. You kinda root for the masters who always let him off by not killing him. He did after all kill a student of the masters. :)
4,Like it,"My husband love this movie and had it on video cassette, i surprised him with the DVD. The movie arrived right on schedule, even arrived earlier than expected."
3,This is not going back to their roots.,"I've been a fan of Hed PE all the way up to Blackout. They haven't disappointed too much with this album. But in no way is this ""hardcore"" or going back to their ""roots"". There are only 5 songs that I find intriguing; the rest contain unintelligent lyrics. I wonder if Jahred understands that there are other words in the English language other than the s***, MF'er, F, and all those other things. If you like a dumbed down version of Hed PE, well here you go!"
1,Who would want to copy this junk anyway???,"This is quite possibly the worst CD I have made the mistake of purchasing in a long, long time. The CD protection software is so pathetic and corrupt, it makes this virtually impossible to use - unless I start carrying a discman to the gym again. Not anytime soon. What I really can't figure out is who in the heLL would want to pawn this horrible stuff off on other people? If they have heard it, I guarantee they won't want a copy. Whiny, expletive filled lyrics and a sad attempt at music. This was tired before it was burned and distributed. Save your money."
1,Mixed Message,"Cursing just to curse is something that I outgrew in junior high. And (loudly, obscenely and repeatedly) railing against corporate rock while putting copy protection on your CD is just one of the worst kinds of hypocrisy."
3,"Musically Great, Lyrically Aweful","I'v been a big and loyal fan of (hed)pe since their self titled cd. They have been my favorite band, so i was very anxious to hear this album. However it has fallen short of what i was hoping for. Musically this cd is better than broke and blackout, and right up there with the self titled cd. Jaxson and Moke tear this cd apart. Moke delivers the punk style of drumming that has been absent since their first cd. However Jahred lyrically has delivered just the opposite. His choice of words are cheesy and he says the same thing over and over again, Girls, FCC, and getting drunk and high. Im used to him saying those things on songs, but not as much as this album. I give this 3 stars just because musically its a very good/great. Jahred come back to us, its not 2012 just yet. Go out and get the self titled album."
1,"This is some of the most horrible, uninspired 'music' I have ever listened to.","Honestly, listen to the lyrics and try not to be ashamed to be an American (or if you're not from the US, then try not to hate Americans any more than you already do). It's pathetic, really. Even if they didn't use derogatory slang like f*g, f*gg*t, and all the various uses of f*ck, OR have 20 references to having sex with teenagers in every song, this CD would still be trash.To put things in perspective, I listen to all kinds of music and I'm NOT Christian or against cursing; still, there is just nothing here to make it worthwhile to listen to. It's immature, it's bland, it's just plain crap. Steer clear, I have no idea why a label even released this."
2,Contents obsolete at publishing date,"Thinking this would be a good book to be introduced into web services I ordered this book. It contains several chapters with examples. One chapter (7) inticed me to try the example. But when I downloaded the required software (IBM's wstk), it was a newer version. The chapter is not compatible with the new software, and that for a book that is available on the shelves for only two months.I think it is a good book, should rate it on four stars. The use of outdated examples makes me rate it on (only) two stars."
2,The Bomb is a bomb (not the best of...),"I bought this CD when it came out in the early 1990s. Most of the tracks on this CD are edited / cut, probably for radio air play. If you want a Parliament Greatest Hits CD, purchase ""20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Parliament"" on Island / Mercury label. It contains virtually the same list of songs, and nearly every track is 3 or 4 minutes longer (the original album edits). Plus the digitally re-mastered sound is spectacular."
2,Not enough room in the grip area,"The price is right but there's not much you can do with this bar. There's barely enough room to slide on a standard grip. To fit brake levers requires cutting down the grip a bit and forget about bar mounted shift levers. It's the wrong shape, not enough sweep, for inverse levers or bar end shifters so that's not really an option; stem shifters would almost make this bar usable."
2,Disappointing,"This game is not what I expected. Based on the title and the reviews, I thought it would be a ""dirty"" game of charades to play with adults. The scoring is weird and the words are really hard. I didn't find anything raunchy as some previous reviewers did. My issues lie more with the things you have to act. I can understand ""Knee high boot"" and ""Getting to first base"" but how in the heck do you act out ""Exploring Uranus with a telescope?"""
2,"really sad, not sure just who this is aimed at","Very disappointed in this video, hurt my arm last year and have been trying to get back to bowling better, thought this might help, but when you have some guy on the lane and not sure just what he was doing watch Walter Ray bowl against six regular guys and beat all but one and really not give someone anything other than what a high average bowler already knows, which still doesn't help anyone, I was sorry I spent the money on this title..Oh well live and learn.."
1,my daughters player,"we bought this with the intent for our summer trips, and our daughter has been using it non-stop until the sound system died. we had not even had it a month and it stopped working. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"Paid too much for USB, and not upto expectation",I paid so much only because it has USB port. I thought I can just hook in my USB hard drive to play anything I want. But it can only read Flash drives. I tried playing some movies in my 2GB flash drive. It didn't work because it was in data format.I still have to spend my time in buring CDs to play. USB is waste. Non-USB players are very cheap compare to this one.Paid extra for the feature which is useless.
1,Terrible,"This book skips over technical details and site creation. It ignores most details regarding the MMC and the internet administration tool. It is painful to read and bloated with useless screenshots. Sadly, this is a typical MS product book."
1,Not recommended for professionals,"I'd rather recommend reading SiteServer Help. If you plan to create sites more complex than dummy SiteServer templates, you really need a book with extended troubleshooting chapter."
2,Not as good as many say,"I'm working on setting up a corporate intranet web site that will use Site Server primarily for Content Management, Search and Analysis. The book does not adequately explain the process for setting up this type of site. The Membership Server installation is not fully explained and you will probably end up using Access as your database. The example sites that ship with the product are not much help either. The section ""Creating a FrontPage Publishing Site"" is also lacking necessary detail for this scenario. They try to cover way too much material in one book. Also, there are so many different ways to set up Site Server that you could have a book this size just to cover that topic. Only small sections of this book have been helpful. I'm thinking that when I finish this project I'm going to write my own book."
3,An OK Book,"This book was OK, but the beginning put me to sleep, and the end was very uninforming, and I felt like I was left hanging. The middle was Ok, and was a little exciting. If you like making up one of the most important parts of a book, read this one. If this wasn't A CLASS ASSIGNMENT, I would have put it down after the second chapter."
3,It was OK.,The book was OK. I thought it was boring. There was too much suspense but not enough action. It wasn't funny enough and hard to read.
3,This book had way to much hard vocab in it!!!!!,"Gebu is the worst brother ever! How can he beat Ranofer and tell him he's crap? I think this book is psycho. But n e ways, Ranofer is a poor young boy who has to earn money from his half-brother and give it back to him! Also, Ranofer is trying to proove that Gebu (his half-brother) is a thief along with his friend Wenamon. They've stolen gold and many other things from pharoah tombs. Ranofer finally persuades the queen to let the guards out to look for the thieves and the golden goblet Gebu stole which was part of the all the things Gebu stole. Finally they catch Gebu and Wenamon and Ranofer is lucky to have such good friends."
3,"It starts slowly, but ends well.","The book The Golden Goblet , by Eloise Jarvis McGraw, is three-quarters dull and descriptive and one-quarter action-packed and exciting. It is about a boy named Ranofer who lived in Ancient Egypt with his evil half-brother Gebu (I'll let you figure out how to pronounce that name). Ranofer is neglected by Gebu and is forced to labor in the stonecutting shop which is run by Gebu. When Ranofer finds the golden goblet, he realizes Gebu has been stealing from the tombs (which occurs about three-quarters of the way through the book)! After that Ranofer, with the help of his two friends, Heqet and the Ancient One, tries to prove Gebu's horrendous acts and end Ranofer's life of misery."
5,Money Pays for Discrimination,"Great eye opening documentary about the far reaching tenticles of the Mormon Church (who comprise a very modest percent of the American population, by the way - lol) through money and how they were able to get Prop 8 (the rescinding of a gay marriage law) put on the California ballot and pass it. Though sad, I am glad I viewed it. Knowledge can become power... we'll see what happens next time."
3,Powerful and emotional but flawed,"This documentary, as powerfully emotional as it was, focused on the wrong issue. It would have been better to ignore the question of funding for Prop 8 and focus on the LDS' reactionary behavior on homosexuality. The Church of LDS should have as much right to contribute money to a political cause or ballot proposition as do gay rights groups. If they want to involve themselves in political activity, they should be allowed to--freedom of speech applies even to stupid ideas.I know some people will object--after all how can we allow groups with a tax exemption to spend millions on a campaign? A legitimate point, but the solution is to remove all churchs' tax exemption, not to restrict their speech."
1,What you would expect,"My guess is that most who choose to watch this film are those already looking for an indictment of the Mormon Church - and they're find what they're looking for. This is one of those films that plays to the biases of a particular group and does not offer a balanced view. In so doing, the director ensures the film has a committed, motivated target audience. There are, admittedly, many valid points which the film raises. However, it fails to even attempt to fairly address opposing views and instead presents strawman arguments that are easily dispatched. Watch this film if you already hate Mormons (or organized religion in general). You'll be pleased. But look elsewhere if you want a reasoned discussion of the issues."
2,He needs a good editor,"I purchased this book from the author at a convention two years ago. Reading it was a somewhat painful experience. Although there are some excellent concepts, his use of language is immature and highly repetitive. Everything is ""like"" something else. Some of his comparisons are so far-fetched, even after long pondering, the point is lost.I believe this must be a first effort and a self-published book. It is in need of the blue pencil of a good editor, and at least one re-write.As a collector of vampire tales, I am happy to have it in my library, but I would be hard pressed to recommend this to anyone but a hard core reader of tales of the undead."
3,"One Good, One Bad","I bought this double set for the Paulie movie, which is one of my all time favorites. It is so touching with good acting and a moving story line, suitable for adults and children. As Paulie makes his way across the country, he meets up with a variety of friends and villains whose lives he touches in many ways. The premise of the movie is his ability to talk, made totally believable by the all the actors involved. This is a HIDDEN GEM with a surprise ending--a must see for anyone who enjoys watching a good, clean movie with or without their children!Mouse Hunt, on the other hand, was what prevented me from giving this set 5 stars. In fact, it was AWFUL for its boring, annoying and repetitious Home Alone-type story line, its foul language and its predictable ending. Not in the least bit entertaining, I would never let young ears within shouting distance of the crude dialogue. Better to purchase Paulie on its own, which is well worth it!"
2,Misleading,"Amazon listed that this book was written in 2006. It was not. the copyrights are '94, '96, '99 and '03. There are no illustrations of a Saturn SL1 or SL2 model after 1995, and the computer codes for the emmissions and non-emmissions are not updated. There is a Service Light (not Service Engine Soon) that is not referenced anywhere in this book. I am not satisfied with my purchase, and Amazon's web site is misleading."
5,BUUURNEEERRR!!!!!!!!!,"i think BASTARDS is one of the best albuns by the METAL PUNK LEGEND MOTÖRHEAD!!!!!songs like ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES, BURNER, DEATH OR GLORY, I AM THE SWORD, BORN TO RAISE HELL and LIAR are MOTÖ gens!!!! BASTARDS is way rawer and faster than previous MOTÖ albuns like rock n'roll and 1916...It's a return to the fury of ORGASMATRON, one of their best...in fact, BASTARDS is the best MOTÖ album since ORGASMATRON...one of their best, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like the fast HEAVY PUNK of Lemmy and his mates!!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!!"
3,Just ok,This is not of their best albums. They sound too tired and they try to play . Unfortunately they just try. The melodies and the compositions are not so good as their previous albums. oly for Motorhead collectors.
5,Ancient Discoveries,"I love watching ancient history of all kinds, this was more than very good watching and also you learn a lot about the past. I think it was worth what I learn of history of ancient torture and glad I wasn't living in those days. It's always good to know the past and not do was the past over again."
1,This book sucks!,"I need to keep the review short because most of my time lately has to be spent trying to decifer Ziemer's presentation. In a few words, this book sucks! I believe the book to perhaps be the worst educational text I've ever encountered. It is riddled with errors and too few exaples to lend insight into the end of chapter problems. My professor tells me that there aren't any other (better) authoritative books out there on the subject. That's really hard to believe! Looks like there's some money to be made if anyone has the time or inclination to trump Ziemer's feeble attempt. Good luck if you must purchase it."
3,"Beautiful, historically accurate, but not especially well written","I am a TB control nurse in New York State. This book contains wonderful photos and is accurate. However, I found that the author is not the best writer making it sometimes difficult to follow her line of thought. I would recommend it to those interested in the history of the treatment of TB and also those interested in the history of the Adirondacks of which the TB cure ""industry"" was an important part. I do think it is a nice addition to books that cover the history of nursing."
1,Cost,Although the baby einstein movies are great. You can get this set for around $50 on Disney Movie Club as well as in stores for alot less expensive.
2,Could of just bought Shakespeare,"We got this as a shower gift for my second baby, and are glad we didn't buy it ourselves.The Baby Shakespeare video is a good gentle form of entertainment. We were disappointed with Baby Bach. The music is nice, but it is much of the same toys used in Baby Mozart swirling around, so having both are not neccessary.We like the idea of Einstein, but my child will not watch it, and shakes her head ""no"" when we put in Baby Newton..."
2,Somewhat Disappointed....,"Neither of my kids seem to be remotely interested in any of the Baby Einstein DVDs. To me, they seem strange and almost like brain-washing. I think we'll stick to Disney and the like."
2,No attempt to make the book interesting.,"This book has quite a bit of info, which is good. The flow is so bad. I have just decided to return this book. I am dropping my class. I like my intructor and all, but I know a school that uses a better book. using a good book is to vital. This book s horrible. A good read if you just want to read about biology. It is horrible if you are reading info that you will be tested on."
4,Filters work great,"Filters may be filters, I'm not an expert. But they arrived on time and fit perfectly. Air flow does not seem to be restricted significantly."
2,just okay,"the stand was much smaller than I expected. I guess I should have been able to figure it out from the dimensions, but the picture makes it look much larger than it really is. Also, the wheels were missing."
5,Another winner,"Another heart-warming, educational and beautifully illustrated book from the multi-talented Dean Bennett.There's also the sub-text of preserving the Allagash, the beauty of which Dr. Bennett has documented in previous work."
2,Another REMAKE.,"Hollywood does another remake. Hollywood puts Marky Mark in another remake. Hollywood makes an inferior remake.Hollywood? Why all the remakes?Not a bad movie. It is fun to watch but it has all been done before and better. Ed Norton really disappointed me as he is usually a good actor. Marky Mark is not a good actor and neither is Mose Def or Seth Green. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron must have felt like gods among fools working with these schlubs. That said, I still like Jason Statham. The guy has charisma."
2,This is The recipe...,"There's the aw-shucks black guy who is an explosives expert;there's the nerd who can't get laid but can hack the IRS;there's the sexy dope who knows how to drive race cars;there's the salty dog who teaches the kids the ropes;there's the all-American good-lookin' boy that shoots a mean hoop;there's the super sexy chick who had to one day decide, ""Should I be a supermodel or a safecracker? I know! A safecracker!""There's cutesy little mini-coopers, all hot-rodded up;there's the insipid temptation to compare it unfavorably ""to the original!""And then there's Ed Norton.All that's missing is a talking monkey. Or a cute robot. Or a jive-talkin' Genie."
3,fun,"fun heist fantasy. cons: predictable; cliche-ridden dialog (""it's over when i say it's over""!). pros: good acting; the impossible fast driving and (small) explosions are not constant; no cursing and no sex scenes that will make you uncomfortable if you're with a kid.(does Edward Norton always play this type of character?)"
3,Starring....The Mini Cooper,"Never before in the annals of product placement, not with Disney's Love Bug or Bond's Aston Martin has a car so thoroughly captured the imagination of its producer and director.Beginning as three ordinary, if zippy and sassy little urban go-mobiles, the brave little Minis are transformed into brawny, high-powered brutes that lead motorcycles on a merry chase through-and under-the streets of Los Angeles.The Coopers have great screen presence and their acting performance was by far the best of any cast member. I look forward to seeing them in other movie genres: romantic comedy would be a natural.There is one sour note however. In pursuit of a cinematic device called a 'plot', the story begins and ends in the only city in the world where there are no cars.Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine"
2,SILLY,"Silly plot, silly performance, silly car chase, silly music and an absolutely silly ending. It deserves 1 star only but I reluctantly give it two stars because of Michael Caine who as usual does a good job."
2,Useless movie.,"If it has Mark Walhberg in it, it must be useless. That's my motto. And The Italian Job did not scape this tradition. Add to it the fact that Edward Norton worked on it just due to contractual obligation, and thefact that the movie seems like a great advertising campaing for the Mini-Cooper, and you can not expect a great movie..."
3,It has its funny points,This movie wasn't bad. It was a little funny. I liked the cars they drive. But it didn't earn 5 stars in my eyes.
4,Kinetic script!,"This is a movie plenty of action. The script runs about an old thief who decides make the las robery. Thirty five millions in gold is a great temptation . But suddenly there will be a twist of fate.Wonderful locations and excellent special effects. Shuterland as always, steals the show. Walberg is OK and the cosmic beauty of Charlize Theron plays a convincing role.There are many hair raising sequences.A good entertainment but without the punch of the previous version from the sixties."
4,Good Movie,The acting is very good in this movie as the actors are very good in their parts. Edward Norton does a great job as he plays a sleazy traitor who kills several people. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron do equally great jobs in their roles as they are very emotional and do a very convincing job. The rest of the supporting actors do a great job as thieves who all have their own personality. The short performance by Donald Sutherland was very good and believable.
5,The Most Underrated Film of The Year,"One of the best films of the year does not sport fancy A list cast members. It doesn't flash a 200 million plus price tag. instead it has an ensemble cast of B list actors who pull together to bring a truly enjoyable film. One of the best this year, it was largely overlooked by the public. More than your simple thief movie, this cinema dud deserves much more than what it got. Anyone who sits down and allows themselves to be taken away by this flick will not be dissapointed. A definite best buy."
2,Previews give away too much,The preview give you all the cool action sequences so there isnt a lot of surprises. Norton and Wahlberg seems emotionless with their action. The more comedic scenes are with Seth Green. The best part has to be the soundtrack and the use of Pink Floyd.
2,Boring -,"This film is an infantile knockoff of the 30+ year-old original, a weak Ocean's 11 version. Its main purpose is to serve as a nearly 2-hour commercial for Mini-Coopers. Key words - double-cross, revenge, unbelievable."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible Video Quality","Regular DVD in upscale player is better than Blu-ray. For some reason there are a significant amount of artifacts to the point of a distracting line in mid-screen. If you haven't trashed your regular/upscale DVD player, then buy the regular DVD and save some money. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is fantastic...just the quality of its current Blu-ray version is sub-par. I'd return it, if I could."
3,Critic,I believe Rage is an martial arts movie but it could go under action/adventure since it both. I hope the Rage I'm reviewing is the Gary Daniels flick. I like Gary Daniels fighting style.
4,Best one so far.,"It will have lots of new pokemon. For all of you poke'fans.A new quest, new people in different ways, new towns, new battle system, ect. There is not a Poke'mon Stadium 3.If there is, I would know because I'm on Nintendo sites all the time. I wrote this in the middle of January, and the person who said that wrote their's before me, so I'd like to know where they get their information from. But if a pokemon stadium 3, a link-up would be a great idea. I might get Poke'mon Ruby or Sapphire, and I'm not even a Poke'mon fan. So if you are a fan, YOU SHOULD DEFINETELY CHECK IT OUT!Tons of new and old Poke'mon to. check it out!"
5,Ruby Rules!,"Pokemon Ruby is a hard game, but it is fun to link-up with my friends and battle thier Pokemon."
3,"The title is good, but the price is slipping!","As far as I'm concerned, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire have been in the works for a very long time, but I have got to report the following pros and cons to you. Here they are folks:Pros:1. The backgrounds look impressive.2. More badges and Pokemon to capture in your Poke balls, including the legendary robots like Greudon and Kyogre, and the legendary birds like Latios and Latias.3. Up to 4 players can play.Cons:1. The 2-on-2 battle mode can throw you off course.2. The characters look terrible.3. You can't trade Pokemon between GBC and GBA, which means, you'll have to redo your whole team from scratch. Ouchichi!4. The price is way off course.5. Why would the whole Pokemon saga want to go on like this?Even though the total number of Pokemon is 351, buying all of these accessories and mastering the rest of Pokemon will become an impossibility! Beware! You'll need 2 GBAs, Ruby+Sapphire, and a link cable to complete mission 3. Good luck!"
2,Shallowing out...........,"Pokémon has come a long way to here, but it's losing its touch.In 1995, a popular trading card game was brought to America from Japan. It wasn't until 1998 a game for Gameboy was released, a game similar to the trading card game, become the greatest Pokémon master ever. Soon 1999 was here, and to go along with Red and Blue, Yellow. Then later on down the road in the new era of the 21st century, 2000 and 2001 came Gold, Silver, and Crystal. The storyline was exactly the same as before, with wierd twists. Now, we have Ruby and Sapphire. IT'S THE SAME!!!!!!! Don't waste your money."
1,The Most Dullest game I've ever played!,"Please all reviewers read this review with an open mind. Thank you. THIS GAME IS THE MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE. This game has No replay value. and not to mention its so easy it makes me sick. When nintindo made this game it must have been for babies! I completed that Pokemon Ruby 8 times with no enjoyment. I played it again and again expecting somthing more. Oh, and guess what. This game has not a drop of replay value. Nope. Not a drop. The only reson I played it so many times is because that was my only game. To this day I dread that moment I placed in my order for this game. (...)"
4,I choose treeko,I chose treeko because he is a grass pok'emon. He isstrong against water but he's not strong aginst fire pok'emon . I should of chose torchich but i can always restart the game . Maybe I should restart the game. The fire pok'emon are strong against water grass normal and ghost pok'emon. My favorate type of pok'emon are fire ones I can only find a few. That is all I can tell you
4,pokemon rule!,"I NEVER REALLY LIKE POKEMON GAME ,I JUST LIKE THE SHOW.WHEN THE POKEMON RUBY CAME OUT I WASN'T EXCITED . ABOUT A WEEK LATER I GOT BORED AND DECIDE TO BUY THE GAME POKEMON RUBY.I PLAYED POKEMON RUBY . AND IT ROCK! IT SO COOL.I READY FINISH THE GAME. I CATCH ALL 200 POKEMON.NOW I 'M SENTING MY POKEMON FROM POKEMON COLOSSEUM TO RUBY."
1,This is not the card advertised,"This card is advertised as having an external antenna connector.The one I received did not have this connector. The ability to connect an external antenna is the only reason I bought this card.In Amazon's defense, they are willing to take it back.The card with the connector is an older version with a prism54 chipset.The one I received has a RT2500 chipset.Both cards have the exact same model number, so I can't blame Amazon, but they do need to update the web page."
2,Not easy to use - Doesn't connect to some major banks,"The INTUIT web site sold me on their marketing that QUICKEN 2004 Premier H&B connected to more banks and was easier to use than Microsoft Money. I found that Quicken 2004 could not connect to Bank of America, and the user interface was horribly difficult to learn."
1,junk,My program i bought does not update my information. I have tried for three months to get some support. No one i have contacted speaks good english. I am stuck with a product that is garbage.
4,Works fine for me,"With all the complaints, I was a bit reluctant to purchase the 2004 version of Quicken. However, since I was still on 2001, I decided to bite the bullet. While the interface is disappointing and there really isn't anything new or improved, the product works well. Next time I purchase an upgrade, though, I probably won't need the business portion and, seen as how Intuit never really adds any features of importance, I'll settle for Quicken basic. There's really no point is paying for stuff you can get elsewhere for free - like investment analysis."
1,Full of bugs,"I received continual ""script errors"" when trying to use help, making it nearly useless. I attempted the Quicken fixes, which did not work. I tried submitting my feedback that the fixes did not work and I got an error from their web site. It crashed once in the first few hours of use. Importing MS Money files is nearly impossible. Tech support costs 1.95 a minute. At least it has a 60 day money back guarantee.I guess I will continue to sell my sell the devil (MS) and continue to use MS Money."
1,Not Happy at All,"Cover of CD was correct, the actual CD was the Barry White Greatest Hits Volume 2 at all, wrong CD in case!!! No fair, I've been looking for it for a very long time and I still haven't found it on CD.Please advise"
4,Good Stuff,"I read the other reviews about ordering a size biiger than you are used to, and I must say DO IT. The waist does seem small, but I attibute that to the spandex content. The fit and finish are superb. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars it becuase of the fit in the thighs. I am not a really big guy 6'0"" and 195lbs. above average fitness, and these shorts are really tight in my thighs. Perhaps I have bigger legs than I thought. But I think the shorts are just tight. Good product I would recomend these to any one looking for a good swim short."
2,"Speedo Men's Male Solid Lycra Bathing Suit, Black, 32","other reviewers mentioned the poor fit. i had to return the bathing suit, too. i wear size 30 slacks and size 32 underwear, but this size 32 bathing suit fit like a tourniquet. it was way too tight! that said, it was high quality."
4,A unique perspective on the ethics of enslavement.,I very much enjoyed this book. My only difficulty was with the unbelievibility of some of the background characters. The story though is well written and gives one an inside view of an enslaved being's realization of his situation. I'm partial to thinking novels and this is one as well as being a good tale. I've been anxiously awaiting the sequel
4,"Good, hard s-f","Fun to read, with more humor than most other books by this author. Interesting, critical view of human silliness as seen by a genetically enhanced monkey."
3,not what I expected,"don't really know what I expected from this movie, but I lost interest half way through,may be I just expected more and was a little dissapointed when it didn't deliver"
4,"I saw this movie on big screen when I was very young ,and never forgot it. great to see again.","Great movie for family,gives children an idea of hard times of the past .Seeing this movie ,when I was young left a lasting impression ."
2,Beware Disney's 1.66:1 ratio DVD's,"With the ration of 16x9 television actually being 1.78 to 1, how does Disney fit it's 1.66 to 1 movies on widescreen....by chopping off information, that's how.First, Disney gives us full frame Pan & Scan pictures. Then, once someone has convinced them to start selling widescreen DVD's, they still can't get it right and adjust the picture so we see all of it.In ""Those Calloways"", it is immediately noticeable during the opening credits....and continually pops up in the form of decapitated actors [or at least the TOPS of their heads.]Tyring to get a decent transfer of a movie out of Disney appears to be like pulling teeth."
3,Luther's new cd is released the week of Father's Day....,"Coincidence?!! Well I told my kids to get me some Old Spice, some new drawls or a tie and specifically NOT this cd. Collabo's with Foxy Brown (actually not a bad groove), Beyonce, Busta the Weatherman and Queen Latifah (I predict Hit it Again will be a BIG hit in gay clubs-it's hysterical) attempt to hip-hop start Luther into 2003, but you won't be fooled. There's some country sounding filler and at that point you realize this is still the best R/B vocalist on the planet and somehow he's not doing what he does best. For me the best track BY FAR on FATHER is Lovely Day PART II (not part I) which proves my point, when you don't do what you do best your best intentions and effort could be misinterpreted."
5,No other album as brought me to tears nor had me write a,review!! I love Luther and raced to the store to buy this album. I know that he is ill and wish him continued progress with his health....BUY IT NOW!!!!
3,a disturbing read,"this book is disturbing to read,actually the murders commited by the lithuanian criminals made me cringe,as it reminds one that these things are still going on in the world,such as the atrocities commited by the serbians in the balkans,these men are worse than animals,men of the einsatzgruppen and the sonderkommand were not of the same cloth and caliber as soldiers of the panzergruppe or the luftwaffe,very few were awarded merit,most were weak minded criminals given power to do as they please,one can only hope they have no afterlife, they deserve to never live again."
3,ok,"Very limited in. Only goes up to 72nd street. Hard to read. Nice as a gift for a tourist. However, the glue used to keep it in the box for the manufacture sadly ruins the clean polish. It is impossible to get that glue off. After, you are left with a streak of glue and not so presentable gift."
5,One of the best Live albums,The Live rendition of July Morning on this album is unbelievable. I dug through my fathers old LP collection and found this gem.
1,KSH,I did not like Amazon throwing in an item I did not want to order. Now I'm going to be stuck with this bag of dog food. Not worth sending back if I have to pay the shipping cost. Going to throw the stuff out for the birds.
4,Husker Du?,Husker Du Ripoffs? I never saw it. I would have to choose Husker Du over Rites but I see nothing similar between Grant Hart and Guy. Hidden Wheel was a great song. The whole album was a pretty good effort in my opinion. I thought there were a few good lyrical patches in their also. Best hardcore ever nope but a good disc to have in my opinion
3,Totally Disappointed,"I was very impressed by his 1st album ""Starting Point"" ,so Iwas waiting for his 2nd album ""Dramatic"", for a long time, but it was very disappointed. All the music he composed was same style as his first album. When I listen his 2nd album I found many phrases and technique are the same even melodies in 1st album, except two of his classical arrangement which is Pachelbel's Canon in D and Bolero by Ravel. Recording was boring, same sound effect,and same altered tuned his guitar sound. I think he needs seriously develop his composing and fingering style. If you are looking for something new, this is not worth to invest."
5,Pleased with the product.,"KitchenAid makes great products, and the mixer cover is no exception. The side pocket is a neat addition and very handy for instruction/recipe booklets. I would recommend this cover."
5,Good Quality,The cover is very durable and of good quality. The pocket in the front is useful for storing spoons and/or spatulas. I love the color!
4,Does the job!,This covers my mixer perfectly. I still prefer the impressive look of my mixer alone on my counter but the cover is functional and keeps it clean.
3,Muy corto,"Es muy lindo y el material es de buena calidad, sin en embargo a la hora de colocarlo para cubrir la batidora el mismo queda corto. Mi modelo es el Professional 600."
2,Kitchenaid Mixer Cover,"The quality is fine, however, this cover is about 2 inches shorter than my Kitchenaid stand mixer. It is a Kitchenaid product so it was very disappointing."
4,Now my mixer knows when to sleep,"Because of a night light in my kitchen, my mixer was keeping me up, making all sorts of loud noises. Now with this cover my mixer thinks it is always night and sleeps peacefully."
5,Great Quality,This is a great way to keep dust and kitchen grim off of my KitchenAid Stand Mixer. The pocket is handy also to store book and favorite receipts.
4,Convenient way to keep the appliance dust/food free in a busy kitchen.,"Not much can be said about a cover. It should have been a little longer...even when ""pulled"" all the way down on a 600 Pro series, there is a 1/2 inch gap from the counter.The side pocket is a nice touch if you like to keep the manual or recipe book handy."
2,May be useful for those married to the darkroom,"""Beyond Basic Photography"" is indeed a technical manual, in the sense that it focuses on things you can do in the darkroom and in lighting setup. It does feel outdated for those of us who have left the bad-for-health-and-environment chemical world and adopted the digital revolution. There's also nothing about how to take pictures; the emphasis is how to light and how to process the film."
2,Not very Technical or Up to Date,"This book is really surprisingly still in print. It's from the 70's and it looks like it. Some useful information can be gleaned from it to be overgenerous. I find it rather amusing in fact. The photos inside are absolutely ridiculous. They are clearly examples of ""just let me take your picture for this ass of a book I'm writing..."" -- the fat couple in lawn chairs is pretty funny (pg. 21). The discussion of the zone system is laughably short and comprises only 5 pages. Most of the discussion centers around mixing various chemicals in various ratios. I wonder if all of these are still available on the market. The drawings in the text are third grade level, and someone actually gets credit on the cover! This is a very poorly done text and I don't recommend it with so many other books out there on this subject matter."
4,Captivating,"I read this book a few years ago. I enjoyed it then and am looking for it now. The story is quite interesting, if a bit juvenile. It was afterall intended for a younger audience.Mercedes is sent to a professional riding academy. She's doesn't really know anyone there at first, but does make a friend. The local town has a club of sorts that is the teen hangout. There she meets Conner Egan. He seem a bit Lestat-esque, at first. However, he has dark intentions. And Mercedes is placed in great danger, for her life.The story was quite captivating with a few sub-plots here and there. Overall, this was very well written. I never read any of the other Nightmare Club books, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
5,american flyer and victory are wonderful movies,this double movie set is great to watchthe actors do a great jobgood bike riding racing in american flyer the acting and story are superand in victory it is a great ww2 film with excellent acting and storyso buy the set it will please youchfancierfancier of fine movies
3,UPSHAW AND BARBER,"Barber's ""Knoxville: Summer of 1915"" is one of my favorite pieces of vocal music. Barber's musical setting is incredibly evocative of the lovely words by James Agee from the prologue to his novel, ""A Death in the Family"" which became the play and subsequent film, ""All The Way Home."" The music was written for soprano, Eleanor Steber, and if you can find her recording (I have it on an out of print Sony Masterworks Portrait CD) it is worth the search. Also on the Steber disc are other Barber vocal pieces sung by the likes of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Leontyne Price and Martina Arroyo: not too shabby a group! That said, the Upshaw disc is perfectly fine. Her voice sounds pure and sweet and very youthful which is perfect for the narrator's voice-in the novel it is a man remembering his childhood. Why not 5***** then? I truly dislike most of the other music on this disc. Both the Menotti and the Stravinsky arias do not excerpt well and the Harbison is minor stuff, to be sure."
2,Not As Good As The Original,"I had high expectations for this album when it first came out. Lo and behold, about every song on here is a remix. What I really expect from a Greatest Hits album is for the hits to sound just like the original. About every other song on here ""Vogue"", ""Like A Prayer"", or ""Express Yourself"" is a remix. If you want the originals, get the originals---unless you want a change of pace."
1,The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame huh ?,"I just got home from the gym and felt compelled to review something / anything by Madonna . I have this garbage forced on me on a daily basis . They say this type of music motivates . Frankly , it makes me physically ill . ....and by the way ...Can someone please tell me why this woman is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ? Yes , Rush , Cat Stevens - all not good enough .Deep Purple ! Deep #@%@#ing Purple!!! - not good enough .Maybe if Ian Gillan wore a cone bra ? If Ian Anderson got a more stylish codpiece ? I dunnoQ: Did video kill the radio star ?A: Madonna is in the RnR Hall of Fame"
5,Getting Into This Groove,"This is one super compilation of Madonna's best work. Not a single bad track although La Isla Bonita, Into The Groove, and Borderline stand out above the rest. Sorry I just love those two tunes. Material Girl, Vogue, Justify My Love, and Like A Virgin are other noteworthy tracks.A good balance of dance tunes and touching ballads and certainly enjoyable for those who want to go the comprehensive route to collecting Madonna's music. Bigger fans might want to collect her indvidual recordings but truthfully there is a grat deal of filler tunes on her True Blue and Like A Virgin recordings. My advise is to stick with this compilation."
1,Music for old fogies done by an old woman. Pathetic,This is music for 50 years olds plus and aging gay interior designers. Madonna stuff is so unhip it isn't funny. Lawrence Welk is hipper then Madonna and he even looks younger then her and he is dead.
4,Satisfying Collection,"I couldn't possibly ask for anything more in an earlier-Madonna collection. ...But I can still say it's not perfect. Alot of the tracks on here are enjoyable and mix quite well with one another, however, after seeing Madonna ""grow"" into 'Bedtime Stories', 'Something To Remember', and 'Ray of Light' you might say that this album could be called 'The Immature Collection'."
5,Queen of 80's Dance,"Not many people would admit it, but most people have this cd. Why? Because it is such an excellent retrospective of Madonna's 80's hits (with a few missing). Plus it has 2 excellent tracks, Justify My Love and Rescue Me. All the big hits are here, Like A Prayer, Papa Don't Preach, Vogue, La Isla Bonita, Cherish, Express Yourself, Borderline, Holiday, Crazy For You, Like A Virgin, Lucky Star, Live To Tell and more. This is the cd you want if you are a new fan, or if you just want to relive those golden 80's moments."
4,It's unforgivable if you don't buy it,"First of all this is the first time I write a review on an item. And second,let's go with the important part.This greatest hits compilation is quite a very good one.From her Top 20 Holiday (1983) till Top 1 Vogue (1990) with 2 new songs Justify My Love and Rescue Me (these 2 songs are very disappointing) All the versions of these hits are quite good but there's something missing: Hits like Who's That Girl (#1 in 1987),True Blue (#3 in 1986),Angel (#5 in 1985),Dress You Up (#5 in 1985),Causing A Commotion (#2 in 1987),Oh Father (#20 in 1989) and Keep It Together (#8 in 1989) It would be even better.For being an artist of these magnitude,this greatest hits compilation should have been 2 CD's because she deserves it. And should be re-released with new songs (1992 onwards)END"
2,rehashed versions,It's better to have the originals. The versions here are remastered and rehashed and are missing a subtle raw element found on the originals. These are remixes that try to sound like the originals but are actually too different. And the packaging sucks. A precursor of things to come for Madonna.
4,The ulitmate Madonna album,"Im a enormous fan of Madonnas no matter what she does, but I do find myself prefering her earlier songs to this new ""spiritual"" thing shes got going. I mean who can say that Like a Virgin is not a pure work of genius.I love this album and consider Open Your Heart, Cherish and Vogue among my favourites. Im also fond of Rescue Me, which I dont recall her releasing. Maybe my memory's going.A great album, filled with great tunes."
4,The Immaculate Review,"I love most all of Madonna's work and think that she is a very talented artist. The cd was great, I love all of the songs on here except the last two (JUSTIFY MY LOVE and another). I agree that there are still a lot of good songs missing from this collection, but I feel that this is still a great cd. Early songs include BORDERLINE and MATERIAL GIRL, with great dance songs including INTO THE GROOVE and LIKE A VIRGIN, it also includes great ballads, such as LIVE TO TELL and CRAZY FOR YOU. Overall I think this is a great cd!"
5,still great,This collection is better than anything on the radio right now! It has some of the best songs of her early/middle career. Vogue!
3,A good page turner,"It might not be the most historically accurate mystery there is, and it might assume its perspective through rose colored glasses, but it is a page turner that keeps you interested in a fairly complicated story. The characters are human, and therefore imperfect, though sympathetic.And they do observe Sabbath towards the end of the book."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is such a wonderful informational book... AND ... a gorgeous coffee table book. It is terrific from beginning to end! If you like or are interested in, or even thinking about Ornamental Grasses ... then THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! I can't imagine anyone who has an interest in Ornamental Grasses NOT LOVING THIS BOOK, and would be delighted they purchased it. My only concern is that it is going to look dog-earred from my reading it over and over and over again ... which frankly takes away from its beauty on our coffee table."
1,Who wrote this?,"This seems a little shady, seeing as my very first Amazon experience was with PC Universe and it was an awful one. I should have reviewed the feedback first, and I take full credit for that, but a glance at it would have warned me about the problem I had, that so many of their customers have. The product was listed in stock. I called several days later to ask about something else, and found out in that phone call that the item was not in fact in stock and wouldn't be until the day after my latest estimated ARRIVAL date. In other words, the item wouldn't even possibly shipped until days after I had been told it would arrive. If I hadn't called they never would have told me. I was essentially informed that they had planned to just let my order sit until the item came in. I had to cancel, and at least they were prompt with that, but it was still a very negative experience. In addition, the same item is still listed as in stock. It hasn't come down at all."
5,DOWN TO EARTH AND HUMBLE,"Oh to go back to those good old days when Reba was a down-to-earth country gal before she let everything go to her head. This album is truly beautiful with every cut outstanding as were most of her Mercury albums. She was just starting out but at least the music and the production were listenable and palatable. Not like today's Reba whom I don't even listen to anymore.The prize of the album is the stunning ""Suddenly There's a Valley"". Reba's vocal is so spectacular here that one longs for her to a gospel album...something she has never done. Why? Because she will only do what sells and unfortunately, gospel albums don't sell. Whatever.This is prime vintage Reba. If you are a fan of the early Reba you will NOT go wrong with this superior effort. If only she could have remained this way....oh, if only!!"
1,Boring,"This sounds like ""Lawrence Welk"" type music...not traditional country. This album is BORING and puts me to sleep!!! Don't waste your money! Try Reba's album ""just a little love"" it sounds way better."
1,"terrible,","last year I bought my 9 year old a 15.00 louiseville wood bat.He had it for 4 months. His whole team was swinging it in batting practice. This year we just purchased this 29 inch wood bat. When i took it out of the box he was so excited. It felt very cheep to me, almost like a free gift at bat day down at yankee stadium. Well we ran off to the park and on the 12th pitch it broke.12 pitches ,my son wasnteven loose yet. Do not buy"
3,fax machine,It's ok. Nice speeed and quality. It has constant paperjams and the way the paper fits in is terrible. Would not purchase again
4,Home office equipment,I purchased this for my home office and have been very pleased with the overall performance and functions. I especially like the fact that I was able to buy a factory remanufactured one at such a great price. Having both black and color cartridges is much better than just the black film style and much cheeper. Overall a great product for my use.
4,A very good devotional book for women.,"I have recently read, Lunatic on a Limb with Jesus. It is an encouraging book with alot of wonderful womanly wisdom. The author shares life experiences...and how God used the experiences in her life to point her towards Him. I highley recommend this book to any woman looking to be challenged in her walk with God. It's wonderful."
4,Very interesting without resorting to false anxiety,"This is an entertaining, informative, and even-handed look at the Earth's magnetic field, how it has changed over time, what it is doing now, and what it all might mean.The computer graphics used are interesting and effective, but the most interesting part was the (previously unknown to me) magnetic history stored in volcanic rock. Some of the conclusions they draw from this work can really make you think.Although documentary DVDs are usually not very cost effective, giving you a (if you're lucky) 1-hour program for the price of a 2-hour blockbuster movie, this one is worth a try. And as the Earth's magnetic field continues to change (it's clearly in the midst of a fast-moving decline right now), this could be a good source of entertaining info to review later."
5,The infamous compilation of DC punk/HC,"Contains about three songs each from about 12 different bands. Legendary artists from early DC hardcore fame, i.e. the Teen Idles, SOA (Rollins's first group), Government Issue, Void, Minor Threat, etc. An essential document of the sounds that were emanating from the DC basements, backyards, and teen centers in the early 1980's. Not only did this compilation break musical ground, it also was the first compilation to consist almost exclusively of straight-edge bands. It is one of the most legendary comps around, so pick it up. High points are SOA, Untouchables, and Youth Brigade."
1,This Stinks!,"I received this terrible CD (the Tears for Fears version) today and I was first disappointed and then angry! I wasn't aware this is a two CD set until the label on the CD I received indicated as much. The company, of course, sent me the 2nd CD and not the one I requested which was the Gary Jules version (the slower version and it was probably because it was out of stock). It is not worth the money and my suggestion is to not order this mess!"
5,Christy,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very exciting! I am 11 and had seen the Christy movies, but the book is so much better. You really need to read it!"
5,This has always been my favorite book...,"I've never found a book I loved more than ""Christy"". I've read it many times, and I always love it."
5,"One man, everyman","Wainwright taps into the male mind.He is a bit of an everyman. It isn't always pretty but it's always honest. Listen to ""Donations"": a guy with a few friends, who pleads with one of them to let the others know when he is gone, and leaves instructions for his body parts.It is both sad and funny; not easy to pull off. The first two songs are bookends:he's alone, he is 53, and he nudges into adulthood(finally and acknowledging that ,yes, he may be the one at fault). The title song is next to last and is defiant but resigned. Again, two emotions that are usually at odds but that he weaves together. A few of the songs, like ""Graveyard"" where he muses on how we all end up there are a bit sophomoric but don't detract from a great album by an evolving artist(although I would still like a few like ""East Indian Princess"".)"
2,NOT FOR PULLING CHILDREN IN --- this is for kids to pull their toys in,"Please don't mistake this for a wagon your child can ride in! It is a wagon for a child to pull their toys around in. The weight limit on the item is 22 lbs. We pulled a 2 year old around in it, but this is not recommended, it is for a 3 to 5 year old child to pull."
4,Just what they said,"It is just what the seller said if your a male adult it will make you firm, if your a female adult it will make you moist. It was a good buy for the right person."
4,"Silly, Surprising, Sexy","We liked this collection, although it doesn't hold the attention for long and is fun to watch in parts. As others have said, it's surprising only in the way that ""nothing has changed."" But what is surprising and fun about this collection is how they seem to be movies made by friends having sex together and having a good time doing it. It's silly fun, and quite explicit. A wonderful collection."
5,Remarkable,"This is a truly remarkable recording. A re-issue of an out of print performance that the late composer Hans Otte gave in the 80's of his two major piano cycles.These two very different works are rarely performed, and rarely heard. But they are quite profound. The Book of Sounds is worth listening to on repeat... it could go on forever."
1,Battery literally smoked the second time I went to use it - Could have caused a fire,"If I could give it a zero or a negative number I would have.My husband immediately removed the back where the battery was located and cut a wire causing the smoke to end.I had not even turned the unit on, I was just holding it in my hand when smoke started pouring out the back of the unit.Returning it for refund - not replacing it. I bought it to replace a Black and Decker Cordless mixer I had had for twenty some years - The price of the new unit was considerable but I had had such good luck with my last one I thought it would be worth the investment. Didn't turn out that way!"
1,Black &Decker Gizmo Mixer,I have owened one for about 30 years.the first one lasted for 20years and the second one is still going strong. I bought one for my sister about 18 years ago the charging stand transformer went badlast august. So I got her a new one for Christmas. I use mine about 5 times a week.
1,Waste of money,"I must echo what others have said. I bought this to replace my old B&D cordless mixer and wish I'd not wasted my money. Initially it worked well, but now won't hold a charge long enough to beat an egg. I have a wonderful KitchenAid stand mixer but wanted something small and cordless to do small mixing jobs to replace my old B&D that had died. I should have saved my money and purchased a hand-operated egg beater if I wanted something cordless."
2,Not much better than a hand whisk,"The current price (Sept. 2011) is $84!!! I bought this several years ago for $20.The torque and speed are pretty weak. It's ok for egg whites with the whisk. Otherwise I let my kids use it as it's too weak to hurt them.I use the 2 whisks by hand (no mixer) more often than not. With the possible exception of a small batch of egg whites or whipped cream, this isn't much better than a hand whisk.I suggest something with dual beaters that you plug in."
3,New and NOT improved,"I don't think deproved is a word, too bad.The Gizmo is a replacement for B&D;'s Handy Mixer. Our Handy mixer died about two weeks ago, not bad after 10 years so I ordered a Gizmo. Old mixer had charging contacts in holder, new one was downgraded so you have to plug in the charger. New charging contact really cheapens the product. I found a wall wart that would charge the old one so it's going back on the wall. If I didn't have to destroy the plastic packaging to remove the unit, the Gizmo would be on the way back to Amazon right now.We were always happy with the way the Handy Mixer handles what we used it for and I wouldn't expect the Gizmo to be less useful, just not as convenient."
1,"Low power, can't use when plugged in","I would not recommend this mixer at all. The battery needs to be recharged constantly, and for some stupid reason, you can't use it, when it's recharging, which would have gotten around the poor battery problem."
2,looks better than it is,"My husband purchased me this Gizmo last year for Christmas, and I was so excited to finally get out of lugging the other mixer in and out of cabinets because of our small military housing. It was definately perfect to hang on the wall for convience, but the mixing abilities are not up to speed (literally). It is good for an egg or soup, but not your every day mixing of mixes,corn bread or even pudding. Everything just stays in clumps and I have to drag out the old one any ways. I also seem to splatter my entire wall with what ever I am mixing, and when I use a standard mixer with 2 beaters I have not had that problem. And as for the charge, I originally had to keep it charging at all times for it to last during an entire mix. Now it's a year later and even though I never unplug it, it runs down before I ever get my eggs mixed."
3,Japanese style for electrical engineers,"I agree with the other reviewer. Blue Poppy press is at the bottom of the pile in Chinese Medicine publishing. Their formatting is dreadful, their materials third rate (many of my books are ten years old and the pages are falling out--the books hold up fine so long as you dont read them), and the editions full of errors.Having said that, i do give the Flawses credit for bringing into print translations of some of the classics. They have done yeoman service in that regard.On the content, this book should only appeal to practitioners of the Japanese style of acupuncture practice. This is for people that like to practice acupuncture like an electrical engineer would."
4,So Laid Back it's Horizontal,Clem Snide take their name from a William Burroughs novel- Naked Lunch. Despite this- their music is not of the nasty variety- but rather cool laid back folk-rock with singer Eef Barzelays cracked vocals and amusing tracks like Messiah Complex Blues. Deadpan rock in the form of softer Velvet Underground or Fleetwood Mac- with some terrific arrangements.
4,very good,"Simple, beautiful melodies with an acoustic/countrified feel and offbeat lyrics. ""Dairy Queen"", ""Bread"", and ""Messiah Complex Blues"" are the standouts in my opinion. Throw in a nice cover of ""Donna"" and you've got an impressive disc."
5,My favorite cd of Reba!,I to agree that this a great cd! I like every song and never get tired of listening to it. Had mine since 1994 and got it for 15 bucks! It is a true treasure in my Reba cd collection. Reba is a good hard working woman and mother. She RULES!!
1,Terrible,An outdated book that immediately put me off it because I didn't fit the criteria of a 'gold star' lesbian.
4,Denzil's first film noir,"This film should've been a hit since it was based on a well received novel by Walter Moseby and starred Denzil Washington as ""Easy"" Rawlins. Unfortunately it didn't get the notices it should have received due to the fact as Denzil stated that blacks do not like to see themselves as victims. Too bad because this film noir had an intricate plot involving a mysterious woman (Jennifer Beals) who's involved in a murder plot which puts Washington's character in peril and possible imprisonment since one of females he was involved in is found murdered. Another plus was Carl Franklin's astute direction plus you also had Don Cheadle in a career breaking performance as Rawlin's psychopathic buddy ""Mouse"". The audience I saw this with, laughed and were engaged with this flick. If you like a good film noir/detective story and are a Washington fan, do check this out!!"
5,IT'S JUST ME BUT:,"YEAH DENZEL! GREAT MOVIE. JENNIFER BEALS WAS GREAT TOO. INTERESTING MOVIE ABOUT A MAN RETURNING HOME, AND BEING DRAWN INTO THINGS HE WANTS NO PART OF. OF COURSE THE THE BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE BLUE DRESS IS JENNIFER BEALS."
2,Really good concept but shallow.,Just could not get into it no matter how much I liked the idea of it. Really too bad I think it could have been very good.
5,I loved it!,"I laughed, cried and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was in the waiting room of the doctor's office and tears just flowed. Everyone looked at me and asked what I was reading.I recommend to everyone. A good read. I like Fannie Flagg's books."
5,Can't Wait to Get to Heaven,"This is a wonderful book!!! I read it twice from the library and then bought it for myself. It is a great ""feel good"" book. I laughed until the tears fell and rarely do this reading a book. Kudos to the author, loved it!!"
4,fun and funny,this book is laugh out loud funny in spots. some characters have humorously alliterated names and all are quirky and amusing. it will be hard to top Fried Green Tomatoes but this book is Ms. Flagg's best offering of late.
4,Fannie Flagg deserves a statue!,"I love Fannie Flagg and I find it had to believe that anyone could ever be disappointed in her novels. Her latest is so sweet and funny and so easy to get wrapped up in. However if you missed ""Standing in the Rainbow"" or ""Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!"" You should defintely read them since they incorporate the same characters. Elmwood Springs sounds like such a good ole town and makes me want to go there. Get this book soon!!!!"
4,"Enjoyable, but not great","Wouldn't the world be a better place if more people were like Elner? She cares about other people, takes risks, tries to do the right thing and has a positive attitude. And she's a hoot! While the plot may seem simplistic and goofy on the surface, Flagg deftly and subtly tackles serious social issues (racism, terroism, religion, even stress), as well as showing how big an impact one person could have on so many lives. The ""mystery"" did not fit in with the rest of the story and tainted the ending for me. The error that the reviewer was commenting on is that Ida, Elner's sister, is referred to as Ida Shimfissle, not Ida Knott. Shimfissle is Elner's married name."
1,Cann't get to heaven is a great book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book even though I read it out of sequence with Fannie Flagg's other great books. Aunt Elner is my heroine.sally cornell
5,"""Battleground"" a Must-Have WW2 Classic","This two-DVD set contains a pair of films that really should should be included in any WW2 film library. While ""Battle Cry"" is an interesting film about a USMC unit at home and in the island fighting-Pacific Campaign, ""Battleground"" is the true classic in the double feature. Set in the awful European winter of 1944-45, it follows a group of 101st Airborne Division paratroopers as they battle the elements and overwhelming German forces to hold the critical crossroads town of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge. In many ways, this movie seems to foreshadow the great Spielberg/Hanks HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" a modern classic viewed by millions.Buying the two-DVD set turned out to be less expensive than purchasing ""Battleground"" by itself, so I would recommend this as the way to go. If you've never seen ""Battleground,"" do yourself a favor, add it to your WW2 collection, and I believe that you'll be glad you did."
3,DOSE NOT QUITE CUT IT,"I have three other albums by Ann. Her Easy Living cd just blew me away with its stunning sexy simplicity, maybe on this one she is trying to hard im not sure but when I listen to this cd I always get a few tracks in then take it off and go back to Easy Living....which as I said is tops.....a great singer that deseves to be listened to..."
4,pokemon saphire,"The game have exelent graphics, very good sound, and terrific pokemons to catch. The only bad thing about the game is that you cannot catch pokemons like groundon, ho-oh, jirichi, deoxys, motres, zapdos, articuno, and other pokemons in the old versions and pokemon fire red and pokemon leaf green, unlike pokemon colloseum."
5,Best game ever better then retarded ruby,I love this game and i am still playing it and my favorite pokemon is deoxys.
3,I LOOOOOVE THIS GAME!! (kind of),"this game has a few things that it needs to add1:there needs to be someone to travel with you2:there should be every single pokemon in this game3:there needs to be more lands for example:orange islands, kanto, johto, etc.4:there also needs to be more gym leaders5:there should me less of the most common pokemon example:tentacool, wailmer, magikarp, and othersthose are my main reasons what pokemon should improveoh, and one last thing, the story-line should be different, i am tired of pretty much playing the same game every time I buy it. the bad guys should be harder, trainers:better pokemon"
5,FANTASTIC!,Trainers that like Ground and Fire type pokemon will not enjoy this game.Because in this game you deal with team AQUA!You can also catch Kyogre.I like WATER pokemon so I enjoyed this game!Kyogre can help with the ELITE FOUR GOOD!
4,sapphire delight,what i think about this new pokemon product is awsome i'm so happy that there adding on 2 more new colored verizons on the last one crystal.it's also so cool about all the new pokemon and not to be mean some remind me of digimon.i also think all the cool new featuers theres go'na be that will makeing it the ultimite pokemon adventure!
4,Continuing the legacy...,"I must say that Pokemon Sapphire (and Ruby, for that matter) is another great addition to the great lineup of Pokemon games. Pokemon is certainly not just for kids, despite what you might have heard. The reason Pokemon gets such a bad reputation (in my opinion) is the television show. So...don't judge a Pokemon by its level...err...book by its cover."
4,YOU LIKE POKEMON YOU'LL LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,iF YOU LIKE POKEMON YOU'LL LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LIKE ACTION YOU WON'T LIKE THAT MUCH.IT'S A GOOD GAME IF YOU LIKE RPG.YOU CAN USE 2 POKEMON AT ONCE.BUT YOU CAN'T TRADE WITH GBC.AFTER YOU BEAT EVERYTHING IT GET'S OLD.YOU SHOULD GET IT IF YOUR WILLING TO SPEND THE MONEY.P.S.IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO BEAT.
4,A Good Overview,"This book is a good overview of high temperature metals and gives some of the background for how these materials came into common use. It does a good job of providing some insights into the ""why"" some materials are better than others for reasons of oxidation, fatigue etc... But, this is NOT a book you should go to for material data. Most of the graphs are labeled ""typical"" You will more than likely end up buying another book or websearching to get such data. Overall, though, it was a good intro for someone who needs to get up to speed on this area (e.g. for me it was turbine materials)and lay the groundwork. The book is very well referenced to various journal articles and it will definitely remain in my library"
5,THE BEST OF ZELDA,"I AM A 52 YEAR OLD KID! THE WINDWAKER IS SO MUCH FUN, AND HAS SO MANY NEAT THINGS TO DO. I ENJOYED THIS GAME IMMENSELY. I LOVED SAILING THE HIGH SEAS, I DO WISH THERE HAD BEEN MORE TEMPLES. THE OCARINA OF TIME WAS SO HARD AND FRUSTRATING, AND THIS GAME WAS JUST A LOT OF FUN. FOR YOU HARD-CORE GAMERS OUT THERE,MAYBE THE ZELDA GAMES SHOULD COME OUT WITH A CHOICE OF PLAYING NORMAL, HARD, HERIOC, AND LEGENDARY. KAREN STRONG-WINNEMUCCA,NV."
4,For any who are turned off by the cel-shading.,"As a long time Nintendo and Zelda fan there is one thing I would like to say. Please do not be turned off by the cel-shading, cartoony graphics. It makes me angry to see people instantly shun a game because of the way it looks. Shigaru Miyamoto, the creator of Zelda games, Mario games, and so many more games which we all love so much, stated in an interview that once players started playing the game, they would begin to understand and accept why Nintendo decided to go with this sort of graphics. If you are turned off by these graphics don't be, and please give this game a chance. I've played the game... it works. Shigaru Miyamoto has never let us down. Nintendo did not do this to attract younger audiences, they have their reasons and the game will appeal to adults as well as children, I am completely confident that this game will be one of the best games in the series, if not the world.Buy this game... if you don't believe me, rent it, you'll love it."
3,Better left alone.,"Wow, just a short caution to anyone looking back in the GameCube's library for great games they may have missed. I rented it shortly after release and wasn't terribly thrilled with a lot of aspects of the game. The graphics were great, but the sailing, the absurdly easy difficulty, and not getting to figure anything out for yourself...it didn't feel very ""Zelda"" like to me so I passed it up. Well, after finally picking it up, I've got to say it's the worst Zelda game I've ever played. There are good parts, which is why this review is a 3, not a 1, but they're too dispersed. And the sailing! Every once in a while I play a game and think to myself ""Who on the design team thought this would be fun?"" All in all, I straight up wasn't having fun most of the game. To me that's like continuing to read a terrible book, what's the point?"
4,SWEET!!!,"this game ROCKS you get lots of items like the grappling hook, wind waker, boomerang, and bow and arrow plus LOTS, LOTS more this game is vry fun with EXTREMELY HILARIOUS baddies, plus you get a TALKING BOAT. this game tops all action/adventure games, buy it today!!!!!!"
5,THIS ONE RULES,"I got this game March 27th. I have already beaten it and have played over 40 hours! There is nothng wrong with this game. The special effects and graphics are awsome. The ending is sad, you actually team with Zelda to kill Ganondorf. He even reveals hs a cool death. There are hundreds of Treasures hidden in the Great Sea. If you want a game that will keep you hooked, get this. There is even a quest log 2 that gives you a nnew costume, start with the pictobox, and understand the ancient Hylian language the Spirts Valoo, Jabun, and the Deku tree speak. This is the best Zelda game next to Majora's mask!"
4,it is awsome,"I LOVE THIS GAME!. An Evil Wind is RisingLegend has it that whenever evil has appeared, a hero named link has risen to defeat it. That legend continues on the surface of a great and mysterious sea that link sets off on his most epic awe-inspiring adventure yet. Aided by a magical contuctor's baton called the wind waker, he will face unimaginable monsters, explore puzzling dungeons, and meet a cast of unforgettable characters as he searches for his kidnapped sister.1 playermemory carduses 12 blocksgameboy advance compatible"
4,One Great Game,"Finally we get a good game for the GameCube. Playing this game will bring back past experiences of playing the first Zelda games. Theres nothing better than hearing the theme music that never seems to get boring. This game had it all. Dozens of sidequests, tricky puzzles, hauling up treasure from the bottom of the ocean, and the ever famous task of saving the princess from Gannon. While at points in the game it might seem hard thats probably because you don't have enough heart container. That can be fixed with two to three hours of doing sidequests. Overall this is the best Zelda game until they make another one."
3,Fun but what to do now??????????,"The Legend of Zelda, the Wind Waker is an overall exciting adventure. The worst part of it is, there are loads of places to get stuck. I myself, have barely even been able to get on this ghost ship, which you need to get on to get a triforce chart which you need at one point. It's extremely boring to spend hours pondering over how to do something, and it is a big waste of time. I think it's better to rent this game and play the easier parts, instead of buying it and just leaving it around the house because you're terribly stuck. Other than that, this game is challenging, scary at times, but as I said, it can get way too boring."
4,The Legend Continues....,"When Link's sister is captured by a bird on an island, you then soon get a boat....AND HAVE AN ENTIRE OCEAN TO EXPLORE!!!! It's full of tough temples and stuff but it's a great Zelda game nevertheless. ""The Legend Of Zelda"" series is based loosely on the movie ""Legend"" made in 1985. That might be my next review. So far, this is still one of the best Zelda games I have played in a while. I gave it 4 stars because of how difficult the temples can tend to be sometimes."
5,"For a first time Zelda Player, It's Fantastic!","Growing up I never had a Nintendo - My dad was keen on the other gaming systems instead. So I watched with much grumbling as my friends played hour after hour of a great Zelda game. But no more watching from the sidelines!This Zelda game has matured in terms of graphics and storyline, while keeping the excellent story elements that are important and adding interesting and exciting twists to them. Easy to play without being too easy, this game is guarenteed for hours of playability, and even the older Video Gamers can enjoy this, having played prior versions of Zelda in the past or not!"
5,Sob sob...,"Ohhhh... The ending... it was so fantastic it almost made me cry it was so sad. Not many games have even come close to make me feel this way. And it was not yust the ending that was great the whol game is fantastic, this is a game for everybody it doesent realy mather how old you are anyone can enjoy this masterpieace. If you have a GameCube this is a must have. If you dont well buy one now and play one of the best games ever.This is simply put yust another amazingly great game in the best game serie of all time The Legend of Zelda."
1,sailing ...,"this is a must own for all zelda fanaticks.it is n instant classic.but hold up, no game is flawless. lets face it the sailing ... . they could have made the sailing alot more fun and not so long but no it just could not be that easy. any of you people who like to see a boat going over water for fifteen minutes, this is a MUST own. for all other normal people this is a must rent good buy."
1,Less than perfect,"I wanted to like The Wind Waker. It has everything that a Legend of Zelda game should have; great puzzles, fun combat, good characters; but I don't, and not for the reason that most would give. The cel-shading was a novel idea. It's the stupid island hopping that turns me off to this game. The Legend of Zelda is supposed to take place in Hyrule, or, as in the case of Link's Awakening, on AN island, not some ""Great Sea"" covering an old Hyrule. If everything else had been the same, the cel-shading, the characters, weapons and puzzles and had set it in one place without having to hop islands, I would have loved it as much as the other games. The island hopping ruined it for me."
5,Another great Zelda game!,"I have two older bros who are serious gamers. Well one of them got a gamecube and several games for it. After watching my bro play this game for awhile, I asked to play. I was totally hooked on it! I really love this game! I'm not too far in;I haven't saved Link's sister yet. Now, I'm spending my time filling out my sea chart. I must warn you though, if you don't intend to spend much time on it, you'll get nowhere. Anyway, I find the game play great and I love the graphics. I think this is a another great adition to other wonderful Zelda games such as Majora's Mask, and A Link to the Past. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do!"
4,Gift,Bought as a gift so I'm not a good one to rate the game; my son loves all of the Zelda games and I was told the game worked well.
2,Never Finished,"This game was great... until halfway through. Then they send you on a ""quest"" to recover the triforce shards. How lame. They expect you to visit every corner of the world, get a LOT of maps, and collect an insane amount of rupees to pay for those maps.I believe Nintendo just got lazy, forcing players to do this mind-numbing busywork to occupy 1/4 of the gameplay time to make the game seem longer.A few of my friends have not completed this game as well for this very reason. It's disappointing.:("
2,Wind Sleeper,"If you are a fan of Ocarina or Mask, this game will be a let down. It might be great for a 6 year old, but for a die-hard Zelda player it was childish. I beat every boss on the first try. The new graphic style doesn't have the fullness of the previous two games.I'm sad to say I bought my GameCube strictly so that I could play Zelda. After playing Wind ""Sleeper"" I wish I could return them both."
1,terrible game play,"Unlike a lot of people, the new look of Link in Wind Waker didn't really bother me. Actually, I thought it was a rather cute idea. The real problem of this game is the fact that Link doesn't stay on solid ground!There's too much sailing that goes on in the game, and it gets old fast. It takes forever and is just all around tedious. Also, I found the frustration level for this game to be quite high. It's to be expected that you'd have to repeat certain spots of the gameplay in order to get it right and move on. However, there were certain parts where Link had to be angled *just* right. Which sometimes took an hour to accomplish; that is if I didn't just throw the controller at the screen first.I just gave up and stopped playing it because my anger level was just getting too high. No game is worth that kind of frustration."
1,The worst Zelda game ever,"I have played every Zelda game ever, and let me tell you, it`sthe worst game. The game is [way] to easy! Andit`s a cartoon type game. Why couldn`t the game be better?I love Zelda games, and like I said I`ve played, owned, andbeat every one, and I dont lie when I say every one!!!! I wish a little more effert was in the game.?!?!?!?!"
5,The best Zelda yet!,"This game is the best! If you don't like the cartoon type games and like the realistic you might want to rent this game before buying it. There is much more to do in this game. You can even control other people to help you out! There's not a ton of fighting like the other games but this one's better. U can even sail your TALKING boat! There are sweet charge ups for your sword. I insist buying this game, unless like I said you like realistic games better, then rent it first you might still like it despite the cartoonish animation. thanks"
5,ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FROM NINTENDO,"Once again Nintendo and legendary producer Shigeru Miyamoto set the standard for adventure games with The legend of Zelda: The Wnd Waker. This game is revolutionary, combining the latest thecnology in cell shading animation with the beloved gameplay of past Zelda games, the result is outstandiing. The graphics are rich in colors and details, the sound is crisp and the controls feel great but more important, the gameplay is by far the best in the series yet, with 40+ hours of gameplay and many side quests, is a masterpiece..... only for words to describe it: Game of the Year"
1,mario is better,"all i hab to say is ""ZELDA ...!"" ..I hate it! it gets boring and is quite long! all the zelda's r the same cept for different bosses/places....big whooP!"
5,"Epic, beautiful game!","after being let down by twilight princess(boring) i picked this one up. the graphics are fine.. i didnt feel like it wasn't link, zelda, and hyrule just because it was a cartoon. actually it was a great new look for the series.the story is terrific and and deep. its actually more like ocarina and majora in gameplay than TP.recommended."
4,"best sea adventure ever,man","this game has so man secerts and level you will never get tired of it. you can sail acrooss the great sea and if you think it will be boring croosing the sea. think again my friend cuz you will get in some killer sea fighting, man. the story is damn good even though its in cartoon, but it really is a damn good game."
5,where are the naysayers?,"Has anyone noticed that any review posted on or after the release date (march 24th) of this game has been glowing? All of the reviews before that date are based on screen shots from various websites. I just read through all of the new reviews and there was 2 negative ones, Both of which it was obvious the reviewer never played the game. (Also, they were full of spelling errors) I think the controversy is dead! If you play this game, you will realize that it's stylized, not cartoony. It has a bit of a ""Samarai Jack"" flavor, for fans of that show."
3,Um I guess so,"Well I am an avid fan of the Zelda series and I was fairly dissapointed with this latest enstallment. First of all I don't know what they were thinking with those terrible graphics, but they just started the whole game off on a bad note. I was hoping that maybe the story could pull this fading game out of the sewers, but I was wrong as I forged my way through a mediocre (at best) story line. Sailing from Island to Island is probably the single most retarded feature of the game, The islands are too far apart and sailing all over the world is extremely boring! Lastly I was extremely suprised at how easy and fast I beat the game. I would reccommend a rental, because If you rent it for a couple days it is more than enough time to beat the entire game."
5,A great zelda game,"In this review I will rate the game 1-10 for each categoryFun: (10.0) One word ""FUN"".Graphics: (9.0) The games graphics are cartoony but it actually makes the game more fun.Control: (10.0) The controls are like starfox adventures but the c stick controls your view and you can change spin your view while battling.Gameplay: (10.0) The dungons can get very hard but when your out in the open going in shops buying stuff and taking pictures of diferent cretures on the island its awsome."
5,Great Game,"The game is a giant world of fun. Instead of going through portals to get from world to world, you sail on your own boat. The game is easy to play and doesn't take a lot of blocks on your memory card."
5,A Love Trilogy,"This album sent me back to my teens! A walk down memory lane....I was able to remember places and friends that I have not tought about in years. Not only for the beautiful music, the feeling Ms. Summer puts in this album gets deep down inside, sexy, fun. I do not get tire of listening to it,specially when I'm driving, it me feel so good, young and alive! Ready for another dance!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could have given it a negative star, I would. Impossible to play, especially for younger kids. We couldn't get more then one piece on the board at one time."
5,Great for irritated skin,"I have acne and rosacea and use several topical prescription agents (Retin-A, Tazorac, Finacea Gel). I love this cleanser because it calms my skin while thoroghly cleansing and removing make-up. Most ""mild"" cleansers don't seem to clean anything, but this one works -- and also helps get rid of the flakiness caused by the prescription gels. I just love it."

4,Absolutely must find this book,John Scarne is a master. His life is as intriguing and entertaining as his card playing. The man was simply a genius. I am lucky enough to have uncovered copies of his books from my father. This book is one of them and I learned to play a lot of card games from it. Its truly unbelievable.If you can find any Scarne books do so.
1,Never Got It!,"I paid for this and it was never sent. Please send me the book. Upon receipt, I will review it."
3,"background info only, not really a workout","This video is a great intro to the stretches of yin yoga, discussing the why's and how's, but it is not really a workout. She tells you the stretches you have to do and why, but then says ""and you should do this for 5 minutes"" but then shows you the next exercise. So basically, I feel like I either have to write the exercises down and then do them myself or I have to hit the pause button after she shows an exercise and set a timer for 3 or 5 minutes and then look at the next one (either is inconvenient if you think you are going to do a workout). It would be much better if she just held the poses and actually did the workout."
1,The Title sais it all...A Real *Dead* One,This album makes many great songs sound horrible Who was the Producer of this Travesty? I don't think Maiden put any time or thought into this thing.
5,Valuable Information,"To those who are interested in this kind of material, this book is a real find! While the subject matter might not interest a lot of people, those who are devotees of ancient wisdom material will see this as insightful and gifted. I am on my sixth read-thru just because it contains so much material it's hard to grab it all the first couple of times. I found the information incredibly user-friendly -- once I got it down. I think having read this has changed the course of my path entirely. If you are someone who has been in their own pattern of spiritual growth for sometime and are looking for ways to fine-tune and move your spiritual experience into the fast lane. This could be just what you are looking for."
5,Best Cookbook Ever,The Best Cookbook I have Ever Collected!! It has the information to show why someone should be a vegetarian and the knowledge on how to do it correctly. I really like the way the vegetables are described and have the recommended spices directly underneath - A plus. The book is laid out in a logical format that is easy to follow. Every recipe I have made is Superb!!! I have tried vegan recipes from other vegetarian cookbooks before that lacked flavor. The short description of the recipe after the title has assisted me in determing which one to use for the type of meal I want that day - Excellent idea here!! I am just Delighted to have this book in my kitchen to use all the time. The artwork in the book is wonderful. Plus the quotes included are very moving.
3,"Good recipes, bad theology","I realize this is not a theological book but the first few chapters seem to expound a philosophy that is not related to eating healthy. Use the recipes but find theology elsewhere, I would suggest the Bible."
3,Not so great...feels outdated,Many points are outdated and needs a new version..sometimes feels like a book for school kids rather than MBA or college students..
5,A good first Orthodox prayer book,"A good, simple, affordable selection of Orthodox prayers, organized in the day and night cycle of prayer. That alone should be of interest."
2,Repeats anyone?,Most of the songs on here came out previously!! So why waste money!! There are only like 3 new songs and they are average. Don't bother buying this one if you have all the older stuff.
5,2pac resurrected 1 day at a time,"2pac iz unstopable even now az he putz it on the 1st song ""Ghost"".Even after I die i'm gonna be a f'in problem.Then the next song ""1 day at a time"" w/Eminem,and Outlawz.Is the shizzle then song 6- ""Runnin"" w/Biggie is dope az hell.He goez way back with ""Same Song"" witch iz a classic.Also ""Str8 Ballin"" from the group he had ""Thug Life"" iz tight az a tiger.The album finishez up w/""Realist Killaz"" featuring 50 Cent itz a tight azz song.Show some respect 2 tha best and most missed 2pac a.k.a. ""Makavelli"" and cop thiz joint a.s.a.p! -peace from your boy ""Bishop the legend"""
3,This CD was completely unnecessary,"I understand this is supposed to be a soundtrack, but its creation was completely unnecessary. I love 95% of this CD's content, but i think i liked it better when it was released on ""Thug Life Vol.1"" ""Me Againt the World"" and ""Still I Rise"". Just to name the CD's that were mainly 2pac's work, not to mention the early work done with Digital Underground, and the classic track Starin Through my Rearview. While some of the new content on this CD are good songs, I can not even imagine why Eminems voice is even on this CD, its wrong. I am a big fan of Eminem and i am also from Detroit, the problem i have is there is no ties whatsoever between the two artists. In closing id like to say this album is not truly worth PURCHASING. I have it but i didnt spend a penny on it. If your a true 2pac fan youve heard almost all of this repeatedly, and the new content is good but left me kind of confused as to why eminem and 50 cent have a hand in this whatsoever."
3,Give It Up,with the 2pac albums hes dead gone leave it alone this album is terrible i mean pac has good lyrics but the beats are terrible7.5 of 10 lyrics 5.5 of 10 beats
3,icon fades quickly,Towel is fine...but with the first wash the lettering and icon started to fade and flake off.
3,Gashapon,"These Sailor Moon figures are also known as gashapon. There are several different sets for collectors, but buyer beware. Before buying, make sure that the figures you are ordering have photos of the details on the back...authentic figures have tiny holes in a diamond pattern somewhere on the body. If they do not have these markings, they are common and cheap Hong Kong bootlegs. Also, the authentic figures are fragile and come apart very easily. For display rather than active ""play"".Good luck!"
3,OK,This isn't the one I thought it was with Alan Eria.It was OK but probably not as good as the other one.
1,Children's Book,"I was highly disappointed with this book; it was a gift for my husband (who reminds me of Walter Mitty) and when it came I realized that it was geared for children and not appropriate to give my very grown up husband. Aside from this, I felt that the cost of $27 was too high for this particular edition. I promptly returned it to Amazon."
5,Amazing,See my full review posted at www.audioasylum.com for the complete descrition. Ths amp in my 20k system really shined. Onkyo is to be commended for building an amplifier of this qualit at this price level. I said it in my review. A new classic iis born.
3,Tackiest Looking Bible I've Ever Seen,"The Sword Study Bible Easy Reading King James Version has a lot of positives going for it: it has many helps; the print is large and fairly dark; the translation is the KJV minus the archaic word-endings, and thees and thous, with vocabulary changes where a word may be misunderstood today. I think that is extremely necessary.On the negative side, this is the tackiest looking Bible I think I have ever seen. Available in an awful purple or basic black, it has a large gold sword on the cover, plus large script writing as well. Awful!!! The bible is very large and very heavy. The 'red letter' words of God in both Testaments are fire-engine red, and should be made darker. The binding is on the cheap side. As I said, this Bible has its good points and its bad points. Now you, the buyer, must decide. This is just one man's opinion.(But, i do have good taste, and this ain't it):-)"
5,A Look At A Different Part Of Our Culture,"If I made a list of top ten actresses that I find attractive and interesting, you would probably find Rosanna Arquette. This movie gained attention from Madonna's role, but Arquette's character is what makes this movie good.There are things I didn't like about this movie. I didn't like a scene with Madonna toward the end; a little too suggestive. Also, while the plot made a desertion of a marriage seem acceptable, it isn't.However, if you want to be entertained, and want to see a side of society that you may never have experienced, and can put up with worldliness, this is a movie you might enjoy. Of course, if you bring the kids, watch it with them!!!"
2,I'm sorry...but Sasami is so annoying.,"I love Tenchi Muyo, but Sasami just pisses me off. It didn't help that the story was mostly about her either. Next thing you know they'll have novels on Mihoshi! *CRINGE*"
4,Best portable grill I've had,This is an excellant portable grill and is sized well for RV usage.The igniter works but requires too long a time to start grill.I usually use a portable igniter. First grill I've had where theigniter worked after 2 uses though. Good even flame pattern.Works great with 20 lb tank.
4,just what a beginner would want,"This grill is just what a beginner would want. Easy to use and light weight, particularly after removing the cast-iron cooking grate. I read some reviews about grill not being sturdy while cleaning the grate. Though that is true cleaning the grate using warm water and little soap works just fine. Happy to have bought it. looking forward to take it to camping trips"
2,LOOKS GREAT - WORKS POORLY,"PRODUCT IS STURDY IN CONSTRUCTION BUT FLAP TO DISPENSE MEDS IN EXTREMELY HARD TO OPEN AND WILL NOT CLOSE AT ALL, LETTING MEDS EXPOSED."
4,Bought two,Bought two and one of the lids was so tight you could not turn it. Must have been poor machining of the one lid.
3,hard to use,"I got this to store many different pills in one container. The capacity is good, but the lid is extremely hard to turn when it is fully on. I have to loosen it first (which is also difficult), but that risks a big spill if mishandled. At least the dispensing hole is bigger than some others (but it could be an issue for the largest pills out there, which I don't need). They probably should make several different size holes.From the looks of it, I wouldn't count on the plastic hole cover lasting very long from regular flexing (that's a problem for any plastic joint), which may or may not be important to some."
3,"When It Works, It's Great. Quirky Design/Programming","I used my first one once, and the next time I tried to use it, Windows XP reported that it was a defective USB device. No go in another computer as well. To their credit, Primera were excellent to work with and sent me a new one after I returned the old one.I used the new one once to print on some shiny DVDs. Excellent thermal printing. Again, the second time I tried to use it Windows reported the USB device defective. This time it worked on a new computer, and I printed up some professional looking DVD titles.We'll see what happens when I try to use it again on the second computer."
5,OUTSTANDING VALUE,"The LABTEC DC-1300 is an outstanding camera for the beginner. If you have a PC, it's basically Plug'n'Play to get your photos. The reviewer above, apparently thinks this is a camera for professionals. It is not meant to be that. For your teenager, or your uncle Ralph, who's all thumbs, this is a great way to get them involved with digital photography. I have several high-end digital cameras, but I always keep one of these (I own several) in my glove box, for whenever an unexpected photo opportunity pops up."
5,Awesome Pack - perfect for running.,Love this pack. It sits very well on the female frame compared to other packs. Has the perfect amount a space for a training run or bike. Carries all the essentials with room for an extra layer. Love the removable waist strap.
4,Outstanding Art History Survey of Christian Icons,Well-written scholarly review of Christian iconongraphy by an Anglican Oxford Dean who is both an artist and historian. Thoughtful and easily read prose. Fantastic color reproductions.
1,Right on target,"This book has it all. Small in its appearance, but powerful in its contents. Step by step, it guides you on a journey for success in simple progressive terms. Should be a ""must read"" for all high school students and anyone else trying to attain the ""american dream"" of prosperity. It was inspiring, thought provoking and challenging. Should make any reader take stock of his/her place on the road to fulfilling their dreams and the emphasis to make them come true."
4,sweet case for the money,"this is a very respectable case for the money. It feels solid and definitely has the heft you'd expect in a case.One note of caution - this case DOES NOT fit the Joe Pass (Emperor II) models as is, even though amazon indicates that it is frequently bought with the E-II guitar. Instead of returning the case, I decided to perform minor surgery and remove the styrofoam wedge that is built into the case to support the upper half of the body (designed for use with ES style guitars). This is not for the faint-of-heart since I had to cut away some of the plush lining to expose the foam wedge. Once I did that and glued the liner fabric back down, the guitar fits quite well.I give this case a good review in spite of its fit problems with the JP model."
4,good product-,sturdy and functional. does what i wanted and doesnt take up too much closet spacei bought two and use them both
4,great,great product. it saves space and does the job. it fits well in my closet and does not cling onto my other hangers. great material as well. i would buy again
2,Product is okay,The product itself was okay but the shipment took too long and it costs more than the product itself.
5,Classic and well made,"This belt hanger is perfect. My husband has been throwing his belts over his closet door or stacking them all on one of those cheap plastic hangers. After searching for a storage solution on Amazon, I purchased this hanger and I'm so glad that I did! It easily stores and organizes my husbands ample belt collection. It's sturdy, useful, and it looks classy too!"
1,low quality product,"it is simply a low quality item. The paint is off. It is new but looks used and old. Different paint color from 2 sides. Major disappointment. I thought a tie hanger of the same brand at the same time. Same thing, paint is uneven. Product looks used. I guess it is not an individual problem but a major lack of quality control."
2,A Disappointment,"While I love British period movies and usually adore Wilde comedy, this movie left me less than amused. Despite a stellar cast and great costumes and locations, this movie simply isn't funny. Rupert Holmes and Minnie Driver, normally wonderful, both look strained and the dialog forced. I would save your time and money. I recommend the recently released ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" but not this dog."
3,it's ok.,"this could be an amazing item... it looks a little smaller than what i was expecting (i know description says 3"") and rubber stoppers are very hard to get out if you don't have small fingers."
4,Great for List-o-phobes,"Although I am a somewhat compulsive list-maker (inherited from a military family), my husband is completely anti-list. He somehow believes that making a list is giving in and admitting that he can't remember everything (which he can't, but why be logical?). I bought this for him as a starter, so he could see that someone besides his wife believes in lists, enough to publish a whole book about them! He is now warming up to the idea of lists, thanks to this book, and I am also thrilled because it had some lists that even I had never thought of.I think this is a great gift for anyone starting out (in life, or just in getting organized) -- I've already given two copies away."
3,Poignant portrait of courage and friendship,"I loved this movie because of the scenery, and main four boys in the movie played by Scott Wolf, Ryan Phillipe, Jeremy Sisto and Eric Micheal Cole. There are other boys, but these ones stood out to me. They go to school on Jeff Bridges ship and at first they hate each other, then they start doing their homework together and become close friends. I got attached to them so when the storm hit them and some of them drowned, my heart was aching for days afterward. It's a true story, so it makes the impact all the stronger. The part about the dolphin was pretty strong, but to me it was making a statement about how parents end up reaping what they sow. It's really good, you have to watch it with your eyes and heart open so you understand the whole thing with all the kids issues. And of course the storm scenes are intense. Overall good film."
2,Not A Good Fit For 16:9 TVs,"The picture and sound quality are excellent, but the widescreen version is the worst fit for a 16:9 television screen I've come across. It doesn't go all the way to the edge without stretching it and no matter how I fiddle with the aspect ratio on the television, it just doesn't work right. No other widescreen film on dvd have I had this sort of problem with, it's just a bit TOO letterboxed."
4,Coming of age,"I think this is a great coming of age movie. The actors are definitely attractive on teh eye, and also do a good job. You'll laugh, you'll cry - there's a little bit of everything. But it is definitely a very compelling story, adn it is great to wtach the young boys grow as people, as they learn many of life's lessons. I think this should be in every teenager's dvd collection."
5,Tankjock,Very nice movie..great visuals and great drama. It makes me want to go sailing everytime I see it. I cant wait till it comes out on BLU ray. Guys its work the money.
4,Wonderful Movie!,"Two things really struck me about this film: the sea action was beautifully filmed, and the development of the characters was well done. This, more than any other movie I've seen, shows what being on a windjammer in the open sea must be like. There's lots of action footage of actual heavy seas as well as excellent special effects. The changes the kids, who truly become young men, go through are very well done. Knowing that this is a true story makes it particularly compelling."
4,Movie,"It's a great movie. Kinda old, but it's fun to watch all the big name actors when they're young and not so great."
1,waste of money,This item is almost usless. I filled it with water as water is heaver than sand. I would not even begin tohold and average size umbrella.. I put bricks on the base also and it still would not hold up. I had to anchorit with a bungie cord to the rails on the deck. What a waste. I had to get another base which is heavy and metel and works great. This will go to the garbage as it is no good.
1,Does not work,"This stand, weighted with water (completely full), does not hold up a 9' umbrella. The umbrella ends up on it's side with water everywhere. Sad dissapointment with this product."
3,"Good, but very derivative","This album came out of the early 70's UK roots rock/pub rock scene. The songs are pretty good, and the playing is excellent, but this stuff sounds so much like The Band that it is ridiculous. Some of the vocals remind me of Van Morrison too. So, it these two artist are your thing, you will probably find this a nice listen."
5,Dragons of Blueland,"This is the final book in a trilogy that is classic. I read it to my first or second graders every year, and they love it. The whole saga is about a little boy that rescues a dragon who has been tied up and mistreated. The dragon and Elmer then fly to magical places, trying to help the dragon get back to his family. Sweet story, encourages imagination."
4,excellent biography,an excellent biography of Fisher Lord Kilverstone. Essential for the library of anyone interested in World War I era naval affairs. The bureaucratic politics are remarkabl relevant today as well.
1,"Inferior filter, not as pictured above.","Sure, it fits in place of the the spacegard 2400 filter #401. BUT it has only about 1/3 of the folds of the original item - no wonder its cheap. The seller should not show a picture of a real filter #401 when their product is inferior."
4,Grupo Kual - Great Band,"We really enjoy listening to this CD. All the selections are good. CD one is our favorite.Only one complaint: On every song one band member always sings ""wee, wee,"" which is a bit annoying. It seems to be the bands trademark.Fantastic Cumbia beat!"
4,Check It Out,"This CD is a great punk album that not a lot of people have heard about. I don't like punk that much but I think Fugazi is a great band and their music seems to stand out. There is not a bad song on this CD although there is not a song as brilliant as Target from Red Medicine. Songs like Blueprint, Sieve-fisted Find, and Shut the Door are great songs though and the instrumentals are really good too. If you are looking for something new and different you haven't heard of then check out Fugazi."
3,"Strong at scattered points, but SO formulaic at others","By no means is this a good movie, but it is very funny in a few places. The plotline is really so simple to see coming that you can put your brain on auto-pilot and do something else such as long form income taxes or double-check the math on Einstein's Theory of Relativity and not really miss too much.However, the scene in which Dickie finally gets it is sweet and Spade makes it work - so a one-star movie gets an additional star.The poker night scene with Dickie and 5 other former child star actors (Screech, Leif Garrett, Greg Brady and others) is pure comic gold. One additional store for the total score of 3 stars."
3,Except for the little girl writhing sexually...it's good.,"Even though the tagline should have been [...] and the family should have not existed, I liked this movie...and I don't even really know why...The occasional wit of David Spade? Nah. The child stars I didn't grow up with? None of that. I think what did it was that I didn't have to pay for what I was seeing...my friend just gave it to me 'cause he didn't like it. The very same effect that Corky Ramano had. I didn't have to pay for what I was seeing on TV, so I watched, and got some small enjoyment from it. And what's wrong with enjoyment, no matter how small the dose?--and the dose was ungodly small. I say: Nothin.If you want to be made slightly happy by something--I guess if your knee was a little sore, and you were slightly down--you could watch this."
4,Totally cool,dickie roberts former child star. tries comback with totally cool disasterious results. cool funny movie about hollywood and kid stars
5,Soul Stirring,"I love this cd, the lyrics are fun and meaningful.I highly recommend it.Chris Rice can also be found on Pandora."
5,Bed Shaker Alarm Clock,This is a great alarm clock. The name on the clock is Wake Assure by Ameriphone. My last bed shaker was by Ameriphone. This new model is so much better than my old one. It is solid with a weighted base it sits well on the night table. The controls are upfront and simple/easy to use. The shaker and alarm would wake anyone. I am hearing and vision impaired and this alarm clock is a absolute must for me to wake up. The volume and tone are adjustable and the display is big and bold. It has a plug for a light to flash as the audible alarm and bed shaker are activated. I love this clock.
4,Enid Hoffman's Developing Phychic Skills,"I purchased this book to develop my already strong intuition. I wanted to better understand why I could see peoples colors and what the colors meant. This book really has helped to develop my skills. Her focusing, relaxation, breathing, and affirmation exercizes would be great for anyone, even those not wanting to develop phychic skills. This book is very serious stuff and you must be able to devote yourself to it. The exercizes, although easy, will really take a lot of time and practice. This book is definatly a must have for anyone wishing to expand themselves."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"My biggest qualm with this book is how the author writes. It is not very engaging. It is written extremely impersonal, which would suit others much better than they would myself. That being said, it does contain good information and good excersizes, but it's just not for me."
4,An Original In Something,"Don't read the reviews of someone's work before you buy it, even if the album isn't to your liking, it's your liking that it isn't to. This is a good CD. Buy it and write a review for amazon.com when you should be looking for a job."
3,Down and Way Out,"I saw Mitch at a small venue in Arizona. He came on the stage drinking and by the middle of his act, he was almost passed out on the floor. He lay on his back and could barely hold the microphone to his mouth. He forgot punch lines, lost his train of thought and finally in humiliation begged the audience to not be mad because he was so loaded. What really was interesting though was that his comedy and his drunken state were a great commentary on being a celebrity. I will never forget the funniest, saddest black humor I ever witnessed - it was Mitch Hedberg himself."
5,Big Country Fan,"As a fan who wanted more Big Country songs, I decided to start buying the Rarities albums. I must say this is a great CD. I especially enjoy ""You Want Me to Go""; ""The Long Road"" and ""Soul on Fire"". These three songs should have been on a major release."
2,"Great film, wretched DVD.","I'll keep this short: although this is one of my favorite movies, the DVD is absolutely wretched. The image transfer quality just plain sucks. I've watched this on a HDTV set with progressive scan inputs, and it looks like trash. Colors are washed out, there are artifacts galore, and so on. Guess they couldn't be bothered to find a decent print or do a proper transfer, which is a crying shame."
2,don't like it,"The movie came on time, but it has to be the worst movie in history! That is not the sellers fault it is just a horrible movie and I would never recommend it to anyone."
5,One of the finest horror films ever made.,"BLUE VELVET is one of the greatest horror films. As a portrait of madness, it ranks above something like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, for its principal madman is far more mundane and far less easy to understand than any clinically-described serial killer. David Lynch proved, with this film, that he is one of the world's best movie makers. I never fail to be amazed by this movie. The performances are excellent, each and every one, especially those by Laura Dern, Isabella Rosselini, Kyle Maclachlan, and the unbelievably frightening personna of Frank Booth as portrayed by Dennis Hopper, in what is likely his best film performance. Jack Nance and Brad Dourif have creepy roles as Hopper's side-kicks. If you've never seen this one, I heartily recommend it."
3,Good Movie -- Bad DVD Transfer,"The Movie is as good as ever. The video quality of this DVD edition, however, is horrible. Pasty resolution and washed-out colors make it look as though it was transferred directly from VHS. Serious DVD collectors will want to pass on this one until a better print becomes available."
2,This is only comparable to Lynch's other movies,"I saw Mulholland Dr, Dune, and Eraserhead, and I was like ""wow, David Lynch is a pretty crazy dude, I'll see Blue Velvet since everybody seems to call it his masterpiece."" Well, I found it to be much less than that.One of the most common descriptions is ""deeply disturbing."" Which part?? The only character that was remotely disturbing was Dennis Hopper, but that was it. ""The dark underworld of midwestern suburbia"". Oh yeah? He sure does get into the ""dark underworld"". Jeffrey gets driven in a car and punched in the face. Big deal.The previous Lynch movies I saw really made you think. Trying to understand his movie plots in a logical fashion is futile, you have to think abstract. Well, not with this one. This movie just has a cliched murder/mystery plot with...a happy ending? What is this? This is not the Lynch I enjoy.If you want a murder/mystery movie that really makes you think, see Mulholland Dr. That movie is incredible."
2,"Movie was fine, Amazon Video, never again.","The movie was what I expected. I needed to watch it for class, but I'm never wasting my money on Amazon Video again. It froze three or four times through the movie, and the quality of the video was really bad."
3,"Shocking, Over The Top Mystery","Roger Ebert gave this film One Star. Leonard Maltin gave it Two. I give it Three Stars out of Five, because it was beautifully shot and quite original. However, Dennis Hopper's over the top and melodramatic performance was a turn off. Why was he screaming all of the time? Where did he take Jeff to? What was Ben's place? I know it wasn't a whorehouse with all of those old, fat women. But it was Hopper's manic-depressive performance that really annoyed me.As I saw this on a video tape made from cable, I must say the video quality was a bit lacking. I will need to buy the DVD and see it again to revisit this movie. Ebert's One Star review is too low. At the same time, Blue Velvet, in my opinion is no way near a Five-Star film. The cinematography, direction and Lynch's use of chiaroscuro so make this film worthy of seeing once, twice and thrice. I give this film Three Stars and reserve the right to increase the Stars once I have seen it on DVD.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
3,WEIRD,if you like david lynch then watch this ...if you dont then dont lol. Im a fan so i had to watch it but it is definately out there.
4,Entry Point,"Very good film. Definitely enjoyed. It seems to be a good entrypoint for David Lynch noobies, as it the most normal film of his career (besides The Straight Story.), but still retains some disturbingly surreal scenes (like the intro, or Frank.) Would reccomend."
4,something wrong in the 'burbs,"This movie sets off in a ""mayberry- esque"" town, nice holesome town, kid walkin around finds a human ear then go to investigate to get into furthur trouble. He meets a lunge singer who ""belongs"" to dennis hopper and that where the sex and violence and violent sex comes into play.Another great dennis hopper movie, the only david lynic i like, unlike anything else, greatly reccommend this movie if you like violence, criminal ravishment. Great addition to your violence , sexual violence underground collection. Other recommedations,: bad lutenant- harvey keitel,"
2,Confusing,"Blue Velvet would be an interesting movie if it wasn't so confusing. As I watched it, I couldn't figure out what was going on. The whole plot itself was a little weak, but the performances of Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, and Laura Dern were great. Maybe it's just one of those movies that you either love or you hate."
3,Toilet Support,"This is a sturdy, well designed unit. It is relatively easy to assemble and is sturdy enough to support my 250 lb. frame. My knees are very arthritic, so I need the support when getting off the toilet. It is unfortunate that it isn't a fold up type unit since I travel and occasionally get stuck with a non-accessible hotel toilet. I have to disassemble and reassemble it when traveling from hotel to hotel. My wife has made a sturdy travel bag that the unit fits into nicely. It's a good buy for the money, but, like I said, it would be even better if it folded up. I would glady trade in the magazine rack for foldability."
5,Happy Gerbils,"I just got this food in a moment ago and gave it to my gerbils. My gerbils love it. I'm worried they will get fat the way they are stuffing their faces. lol The food smells pretty good and I love the variety of things it has in it for them and how it is made for gerbils, not hamsters. ^_^"
5,"A Book to Make You Laugh, Cry ...","Elizabeth Buchan managed to grab me from the first word until the last. She made it all so very real; made Rose truly come alive. You will want to cheer her on, defend her, empathize with her, damn anyone that will hurt her. She is a woman to be admired, one that you will be able to identify with on many levels. The ending is extremely well done. I highly recommend the audio version."
3,Poorly Titled,"Although a new twist is added, Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman is the same ""middle-aged man leaves his middle-aged wife for a younger woman"" story. Unfortunately, what makes Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman a bit different from the standard middle-age crisis story is also what makes the story completely unbelievable. The main character, Rose, loses BOTH her husband and her job to the same woman, Minty, and in the midst this experience Rose never seems especially upset by these life altering event.I like Buchan's writing style but Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman manages to be both unoriginal and unrealistic at the same time. The end was predictable and the reader never has a true picture of what type of ""revenge"" Rose extracted. However, I am interested enough to read the sequel Wives Behaving Badly which picks up seven years after Rose divorce. I suspect Rose's ex-husband, Nathan, turns out to less than thrilled starting over with the non-maternal Minty and their two new babies."
4,"~Shrugging Off The Old, Putting On The New~","This was a great book to learn from. Rose is married nearly 25 years to her adoring husband, Nathan, when she finds out he's leaving her for a much younger woman. This woman also happens to be Rose's assistant! Rose is completely poised throughout the novel, amidst anguish, hurt, betrayal, & loss. Yet through pain & grief, she manages to hold onto herself & realizes that all is not lost.I don't want to give anything away- just read! The only pitfall to this novel is that it's classic British vocab. I suppose I need to study up on my British more before I read her again.A very refreshing, true, elegant writer. I can easily see how this was a bestseller in the UK."
4,A Great Read!!!,"This is the first time I've read Buchan, and I'm happy to say I really enjoyed her newest effort. Rose Lloyd is the typical married woman who has it all, only to watch as it all vanishes. After being married 25 years, her husband wants out and she also loses her job. The thing I liked the most about this book was Rose's attitude. She didn't feel sorry for herself but instead found truly inspiring ways of looking at her new life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and look forward to reading this author's other books."
2,Easy to Dislike,"I understand that REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN was a big hit in England. To paraphrase Scott Fitzgerald, ""the Brits are different than you and me.""First of all, this book broadcast the forthcoming crises from page one. Right at the beginning, it was obvious what was about to happen to the heroine, who was going to instigate these events, who was going to profit.Even though the scene of euthanizing her cat was one of the most touching I've ever read, this fictional woman is plagued by more troubles than visited the Biblical Job. As far as I'm concerned, all of these sorrows pass the point of plausibility and enter into pure nonsense.Author Elizabeth Buchan clearly is an excellent writer, but the story she has chosen to tell here hardly is original. And, for the millions of real women who have lived its variations, there rarely are such validating happy endings as Buchan contrives.REVENGE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN was a disappointment."
3,Way too small,"It's a durable tool set but it is too small for both me and my bike. It's not long enough for my ride. Have to buy another tool set, not quite happy about this."
5,A OK,"THE TOOL KIT WAS VERY WELL MADE, NICE AND TIGHT, STRONG AND VERY COMPACT, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO WOULD WANT TO TAKE IT WITH THEM ON BIKE RIDES, AND WANT TO REPAIR ON THE ROAD. NO COMPLAINTS."
3,It's OK but not the greatest,"I would have given this tool a batter rating if it would have done all the things it said it would do, the wrench sizes in most cases are too small and can't not be used on our bikes, and the allen wrenches work so so as for the others that are included with the tool thay haven't been tried out as of yet but if it is l;ike the first two I would not change my rating"
4,Yet another fine volume in Osprey's growing series!,"Hugh Morgan does a fine job of bringing these heretofore unknown pilots to life, considering the limited research material that he had to work with. What makes this volume interesting to me is that it goes into more detail than other volumes about the different Soviet aircraft which were flown. It's very easy to assume that all they had were MiGs and YaKs! Mr. Morgan clears that issue up very nicely. This book is well worth buying."
2,Unsatisfactory and unreliable study,"I found this book unsatisfactory in several respects. To start with, it failed to leave me with more than a supeficial impression of what it meant to be a Soviet pilot in WW2 - I found the book dry and impersonal. Secondly, it left unanswered many of the questions I had before I read it, like why soviet pilots were able to score so many victories with the P39, which was neglected by US pilots. Finally, there is one damning aspect: the book is inconsistent, contradicting itself often. For instance, it will say that a given version of a Yak fighter was introduced in combat, say, in february 1943; a few pages later, a caption will say that pilot XYZ scored a kill on that fighter version in november 1942... There is plenty of similar mistakes. If you are looking for reliable references, look elsewhere. The only positive thing I can say is that there are very few studies of Soviet pilots in WW2, so this book somehow fills a gap."
3,Rope Review- Order Large,"This was nice rope.It looked a little small in diameter,so I wrapped a piece of tape around itbefore I measured it with a pair of digitalcalipers so that there was no miss interpretationof the readings !! It measured .206"" in two directionswhen measured 90 degrees apart. It was supose to be .250""in diameter but I did not soak it in water to see ifit would grow before the measurement : ("
5,These guys are the real deal!,"I love Take 6. I almost wore out their CD ""So Much 2 Say"" I loved it so much. Then I bought their ""Beautiful World"" CD and was disappointed they were going instrumental on me! Not to fear, Take 6 came back to their A Capella roots with a vengeance! This CD is just incredible! I have sang in A Capella groups for years, but never produced anything remotely close to the amazing blend that is Take 6. Incredible vocals, outstanding lyrics and brilliant arranging! Buy it!"
5,The One and Only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Once again Take6 has completed another outstanding c.d. for everyone. Being a longtime fan for the past 18 years I truly can appreciate every aspect of what Take6 does and that is ministering to everyone and making awesome music. This group has inspired me to have an interest in studying and learning about God's word while receiving His messages through their music. They are a humble and talented group of guys and everyone who has not had the opportunity to see and hear Take6 will be inspired so and receive the Take6 experience!!!
1,It's hard to beleive that Fox would do Pan and Scan!,"What a disappointment it is to hear that this, a 2.35:1 film will be released as a pan and scan DVD. And by Fox of all studios. This is a cool Dolph movie that had a great atmosphere to it but you won't feel it in the cropped confines of 1.33:1. Why they would remaster it with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and not even bother to present it in it's OAR is beyond me."

1,Without Mike D cryptopsy is just riff raff,How in the hell can you people even consider this trash.To be in the same ballfeild as whisper supremacy are and then youll beg? Classics period and the most brutal shxt since suffocations pericied from within infact Cryptopsy when Mike D was on vocals sounded quite the same as Frank and suffocation to bad They didnt keep Mike D around till Suffocation returned what a tour that woulda been but what the hell the one thing deathmetal has tought us over the years is that something may be the best for a time but it is short lived in most cases. You say lord worm is brutal i can name 20 people that could replace him today and make the same sound are better so screw you cryptopsy and see you in the cut out bin there was a reason cryptopsy wasnt known until Mike D showed up and in a year they will just be another causlity on the long list of failed death bands r.i.p
1,stupidity,"I saw a video by this band on headbangers ball and my dad asked me if this was metallica...........HAHAHAHAHA they wish I dont understand what is this is it christian metal because they refence the bible alot but then agian I dont think God would aprove of this crap what kind of name is ""lord worm"" Its just like listening to arch enemy but with a very large man hitting a trash can with a base ball bat beside the stereo because of thier mentally crippled drummer these guys need to be shot!"
1,"Don't Buy This, Rent It","The song list for this DVD is misleading. The first ""Light My Fire"" picks up midway, ""Hello, I Love You"" is the video of Jim singing in the street, cut with some footage of him messing around with fans, and ""Alabama Song"" is played over a few still shots/photos and the credits. The Jefferson Airplane commentary is boring and completely useless in terms of teaching anything, or even just being entertaining. I suspect the Jefferson Airplane interview was included because, without it, this DVD would only run about 45 minutes. If you are looking for a good concert DVD of the Doors, this is not it. Live at the Hollywood Bowl is the best. Don't take my word for it. Rent it and see for yourself."
5,a must see and read,IF YOUR FROM AUBURN AND YOU WANT TO RELIVE THE HISTORY OF YOUR CITY THIS BOOK AND VOLUME TWO WILL BE OF GREAT INTEREST TO YOU. ITS SAD TO SEE A CITY WITH SUCH GREAT POTENTIAL DIE A SLOW DEATH WITH THE CORPSE OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ROTTING AROUND IT.
4,Simple but fun 1950s classic,"This is a great, clear, crisp remastering of a simple but fun 1950s classic Godzilla-like story. A frozen dinosaur warmed back to life through an atomic bomb blast. Where have you heard that story line before? Several scenes from this movie have been cloned and updated in more recent sci-fi movies. Simple plot and special effects by today's digital film making standards but fun and not too scary for younger kids. Crisp and clear video and audio."
3,Mini playing cards,"These cards are very small and hard to transport because there's no box/case (so I made my own). Also, the cards are made of uncoated thin paper, which makes them very hard to shuffle. They are good as novelty gifts, but not too practical."
5,Great Amtrak Book,"One of the better books about Amtrak. Not only are the pictures well done, but the history and operational details are well done too. Any book about railroading written by Brian Solomon is going to be great and this is no different. If you enjoy Amtrak, passenger rail in general or just anything do do with railroad you will definitely enjoy this book."
1,Review,My son did not like the movie. He is 11 months old. I did not like the movie either. It was boring!
5,way better than screwed on lid,this door makes it easy to get access and adds room for wires. worth the extra money over the screw ons.
5,one of the greatest!!!!,i thought it was excellent and i'll never doubt that ice cube can return at any time. this rox the west coast!!!
2,The remix with DMX is hot,We be clubbin is the way ice cube is puttin it down right now. He will never represent the west coast the way 2pac did but he's the best hope we got. The remix with DMX is cool though.
2,Mis-sized & mis-photo'ed for Ford Five Hundred,"The product was too small in the bottom section to fit on my 2006 Ford Five Hundred.The top section does NOT have two areas which stay up in the air, as pictured, and which might have served as bug/stone deflectors.It was a disappointment, but I was ""out"" only a couple of dollars as Amazon did promptly refund the purchase price and about $5 of the $7.31 USPS charge to return the item.My wife now thinks I am foolish to purchase items on-line."
4,How is it possible...,"that most reviews give this five stars while a few give it one??? People have different tastes, thank God Fugazi understands this and doesn't let it affect their music.The first 7 songs on this album are the pinnacle of ""punk"". Raw fury with intelligent lyrics. The next 6 ain't bad either.For my money this is a must CD in any music lovers collection, and I'm not just saying this because I'm from D.C."
4,Escape into the Night,"Anyone who studies Revelation in the Bible, knows that it is a difficult book. What this author has done is to explain the biblical text in such a way to make it very understandable. I would recommend it to anyone who is studying their personal Bible or for Bible studies at their church home."
2,This hat will only fit a toddler.,I bought these hats for my daughter's 8th birthday party but when they arrived they were way too small. They must be meant for a toddler but aren't listed that way. I hope this is helpful.
4,This chic ROCKS...,"Just wanted to be the first one to write that judging by the single of the BOWIE Cover this chic rocks. Her mellow harmonies, Juliana Hatfield like voice and steel guitar work can concoct quite the power emo cocktail."
4,An excellent atmosphere provided by The Last Town Chorus,"The Last Town Chorus may be reminiscent of mid-80's Cowboy Junkies, often more about the place the music is; instead of how it got there or where it is going. Megan Hickey has a genuine and unique sound, both in voice as well as instrumentally, coupled with lyrics which reveal themselves as increasingly more introspective upon review. Teamed with high quality accompaniment, Hickey creates an atmospheric album of matured pace and superb musical exploration."
2,Does not stay up,"The support is great but after wearing them once, its difficult to get them to stay up. I followed all the directions on how to clean, avoid lotions etc and STILL the product will not stay in place. The pair of hose became a ONE TIME USE only product."
4,"Helps my leg, but needed modification","I have a painful varicose vein on one leg, so bought these thigh-highs so I wouldn't have to wear both legs. They stayed up the first few times I wore them, but then never stayed up. So, I cut off the foot and now wear it ankle to thigh, which I prefer anyway! Surprisingly, the did not run or unravel when I did this and are much more comfortable without toes! They are sturdy and no runs. They seem to be a good medium compression. The mediums were the right size for me ( 5'9"", 150lbs)."
2,"Tops loosened up on her legs , correct sizing too.",The thigh hi part loosened up on both legs and the stockings would not hold up after 2 uses !
2,slip and slide...,I put these Jobst thigh highs on at 6:30am this morning and within an hour they had slid down my thigh about 6 inches. The other brand I have doesn't move much at all but are way more expensive. I guess this is an example of getting what you pay for.
2,Not enough fielding statistics.,"Obviously TOTAL BASEBALL and STATS Inc forget that fielding statistics are a lot more important than some off the cuff theoretical formulas that have little to no value in predicting the true worth of a player. It focuses too much on purely POWER numbers instead of the COMPLETE player. No wonder today's youth is so screwed up. I blame TOTAL BASEBALL and STATS, Inc."
5,Great Collection of Songs,I love the songs in this collection. The duet of my wedding song is in this set. This is the only collection of songs I love from this artist. I would recommend this cd collection to anyone.
5,Great Unreleased Songs,"Two previously unreleased songs (""Return to Me"" and ""Sing out in Joy"") were worth the purchase of this ""Collection"". Also, ""Nothing is Impossible"" released on her very rare and limited independant album is also on disc two. If you love Jen., these three songs alone are worth it and can't be found elsewhere on disc unless your'e willing to pay over $250 on ebay for her independant release if it's still available at all. Buy this ""Diamond in the Rough"" Collection!"
3,DOBIE WARNING SIGN,The sign is a good size...it is plastic though and not metal and so it cracked somewhat when we secured it into place. i'd get metal or pay less if i had a do over but it is still a useful product.
4,Nisi J. (New York),"This makes a great cushion hung over a yoga chair. The cushion is very comfortable and I use it on the couch, too, when I'm studying or using the computer for hours. However, it's original intention - to be used attached to an upright chair - is not its best fit as the little elastic band in the back doesn't work well to keep it secure on an upright chair. It becomes more annoying than helpful in that situation and to correct this there should be a fastener on the bottom to secure it to the chair seat to prevent it from slipping forward. But if you have a yoga chair or sit at a couch for hours and want some relief this is a worthy cushion."
1,i really like this bible,"Forget the fact that it is an insult to African-Americans. I like this Bible, because it is an insult to God himself. I mean, wouldn't God want to insult himself with his own inspired writings? Duh.... Get it right guys!"
2,Poor version of sandalwood,"The quality of the cream is fine, but the scent smells like an wet ash tray. One tube was enough for me."
3,Not Bad,I am really rating Old Taylor of Bond Street which is what I was shipped. This is a fair shaving cream but not as good as Proraso or Colonel Ichabod Conk Glycerine Shave Soap. The Conk product is used in a mug (preferably with a good badger brush) and is still the best way to go.
3,Mediocre film-noir thriller,"3 1/2 starsIt may not be a great classic but it is still viewable and entertaining. It has some beautiful outside settings in San Francisco, plus the always alluring presence of Bogart & Bacall.The plot is not really thrilling or believable, but it lets you go with the flow. Slow paced, low-key dialogues, lack of action. Bogart seems to take it easy in this role: he just showed up for work. And this is rather a passive role for him.What doesn't help either is that we don't see Bogart in the first quarter hour; and the next quarter hour we don't hear him... and still the movie holds. A way to spend 100 quiet minutes some boring afternoon."
3,"Not Outstanding, but Still Fun","I suppose it was a risk not showing Bogie's face until an hour into the film and the plot is not at all credible, but so what? The film still more or less works, and it's fun to sit through. The initial scene with the cabbie alone is worth the price of admission. Great dialogue - ""still, I like goldfish"" - well delivered by D'Andrea. It's a testament to Bogie that he would allow the scene to be dominated by a very talented character actor. In that way, Bogie was sort of like Paul Newman. They're both marvelous actors who liked to surround themselves with other marvelous actors so that everybody looks good."
5,Movies,I love old movies. Bogie and Bacall only made 4 movies together and they are must haves if you like the classics.
3,good writer,"but just an ok plot. Has the reader quessing, how was it done? But that doesn't save the whole thing. Bad guy leaves a lot to be desired. will give the author another try."
1,GREAT SHOW -- ONE DRAWBACK :(,"Although the context of the video gets an overall ""9""...the audio was awful. I had to experiment with different soundfields on my receiver to get the ""in person"" concert feel in my living room. How in the world can anyone listen to a live version of GOLDFINGER and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER in mono??"
4,Campfire here we come!,I had been to a camp leaders workshop and they use books like this one. I just wish it had larger print at night with low light it is hard to read unless your acutualy at the edge of the fire.
2,A decent try but no cigar,"For some reason no-one has ever managed to make a good film about the Cuban Revolution, with Hollywood often drawing in some of its biggest stars - usually in the hope of another Casablanca - and missing by a mile. Case in point: Havana, a disappointingly dull misfire from Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford that never catches fire for all the money on the screen. The night scenes are beautifully shot and the script makes half-hearted attempts to examine the moral contradictions in the last days of Battista's rule, but it's pretty uninvolving stuff not helped by the total lack of chemistry between Redford and Lena Olin. The few potentially good scenes never quite work and the compensations are largely cosmetic, although Alan Arkin and Richard Farnsworth offer reliable support and Terence Marsh's production design is superb. Not terrible, just not terribly good. Still, at least it's better than Cuba or Che."
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought this from Tues. Morning and was excited about it. I paid 29.99 there so it was a good deal. I got home and started messing with it and was very disappointed after seeing how it worked. The concept is great! But the follow through is way off. The ""touch screen"" is not a touch screen. You have to press very hard to activate the screen. Like, so har, that you finger gets sore from pressing. The monatage of pictures for the babies are beautiful with lovely sounds and great graphics. My vision impaired son loved it and liked the sounds it made. But when you moved the toys on tot he next stage it was not back lit. It only lit up and flashed which was annoying and it would wait for you to press the screen for a response. Not a kid friendly toy at all. I don't know why they don't have parents test these things out."
2,Like reading an encyclopedia,"This is nothing more than a collection of data arranged in novel form. Every time an individual is mentioned for the first time, we get a complete bio on him. Such as when and where he was born and what is SS membership number was, etc. Who cares!!! It has NOTHING to do with the subject matter.In addition there are numerous long (and boring) efficency reports and promotion commendation reports. If you strip out all of these types of things, the rest of the story of the unit itself (as told in this book) could have been told in less than 50 pages."
