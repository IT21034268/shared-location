4,Great deal for the price,"I got this when it was a Screaming Deal, for only $19.99, here on Amazon, and for that price, I don't care so much that the picture is a bit soft on some of the films. If you can find it that cheap, I recommend getting it, but read other reviews that go more into the technical aspects, if that's a deal-breaker for you."
3,"If you love Mel Brooks, you'll like this collection","I like Mel Brooks - especially his more well known classics like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Spaceballs. But the others titles were a bit more obscure and for good reason - they are definitely not main-stream. The collection was a good way, though, to see other movies that I wouldn't have checked out any other way. If you like Mel B, you'll probably like the collection."
4,"Good set, disappointed there that ""The Producers"" is missing.","Big fan of Mel Brooks. This is my first Blu-Ray disk purchase, in fact. I was very disappointed that The Producers was skipped (especially since it was the first film he directed) which is why it got 4 stars. Not quite so much that Dead and Loving It and Life Stinks were excluded. Many BR-disks/DVD's support mouse use when playing through a PC, but these disks do not. Not a huge issue, but a quibble nonetheless."
2,Boxed Sets,"This is not so much a review as it is a comment about boxed sets.As far as the movies included in this set I already own three of them, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles & To Be Or Not To Be. I have been looking for ""Robin Hood, Men In Tights"" since it came out (I thought). Its cost through Amazon Satellite Stores is almost $60. Blazing Saddles is not one of my favorite movies, now I will have two copies,Young Frankenstein is great, but again now I will have two copies. I've never heard of twelve chairs and am not really interested in History Of The World or Silent Movie, which brings me to my point. I cannot understand why the studios make these boxed sets. This purchase for me is a ONE TIME deal as boxed sets really turn me off. It almost seems as though studios include movies that they might not be able to sell as a stand alone movie (Twelve Chairs)and look at boxed sets only as increasing the bottom line rather than customer satisfaction."
5,High anxiety,"A spoof on the Hitchcock classic that doesn't miss a beat,proving Mel Brooks is king among all comic geniuses."
3,Mel Brooks Review,This is a good collection. I wish The Producers (Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel version) and Spaceballs had been included. I am a huge Mel Brooks fan and wish there were others like him with such talent.
4,Awaiting the Blu-Ray version,"This set is nice, but I can't believe the studios haven't released this same collection in HD format yet. What is currently holding me from buying a Blu-Ray player is exactly the lack of any decent comedy movies in Blu-Ray format. Instead, the studios seem to think that releasing Vin Diesel and Stallone movies is somehow a priority for HD format releases. As if seeing explosions in HD would make any difference!.I hate the studios, I really do."
1,OK.....,"Well then I guess it is unanimous! I also only wanted 'Robin Hood' on DVD and yet they got me again! I have been on the waiting list for the DVD for years and still I am waiting just to get that movie. Oh well, at least I still have a VCR."
4,Good Ole Mel,"All classic stuff, except 12 CHAIRS. Just can't get into that one. Blu Ray is the best. Mostly good transfers."
3,"Where is ""The Producers""?","This collection contains unfunny duds like The Twelve Chairs, Silent Movie and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, yet not what is arguably his best and funniest film, The Producers. What gives? Why is it that Greatest Hits CDs and movie collections like this NEVER get it right? NEVER. And this isn't a matter of taste or opinion; nobody thinks those three films are laff riots. Not only does The Producers have Gene Wilder (as does Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) but it has Zero Mostel, Kenneth Mars AND an Oscar-winning script. This is all moot for me anyway, as I already have all the funny ones in this collection."
3,it was the thriller/suspense moments that worked the most for me,"this comedy/thriller actually works for me to a certain degree.it's aspoof of Hitchcock films,and some of the comedic moments work well.iactually laughed once in awhile.but what really works are the thrillerand suspense moments.Cloris Leachman is particularly effective as thenurse from hell,Nurse Diesel.she really created a memorablecharacter,in my opinion.Mel Brooks was actually not bad in a semiserious role.actually the acting was good all around.and i don't mindsaying i was on the edge of my seat quite a bit.this movie kept meinterested right to the end.i really found it quite suspenseful andthrilling.i'd definitely watch it again.for me,High Anxiety is a 3/5"
3,Don't buy this Video if you're looking for the TV version,"High Anxiety is my favorite Mel Brooks movie by far. But the video version is not the same as the TV version that I saw in the 80s. Many of the funny scenes are cut from the video such as Harvey Korman asking how the fruit cup is; You say ""tomato"", I say ""tahmahto""; ""McGuffin? McGuffin? McGuffin? I don't know any McGuffin!"", etc. The one scene that was cut from the TV version and is in the video version is an airport flasher, which I didn't think was too horrible not to show on TV. I just think this was a really strange editing job. Did I see the director's cut on TV? Why did they choose to cut all those scenes from the video version? This boggles my mind as much as the infamous octopus scene that was cut from the Goonies but is mentioned in the last scene when they emerge from the caverns. Anyway, if you're a fan of the TV version High Anxiety, don't buy the VHS. You will be highly disappointed."
5,It's classic Mel Brooks!,"When Mel Brooks is funny, he's hysterical. This set brought light into a gray day, and made me laugh out loud."
5,Mel Brooks,"This Mel Brooks DVD Collection, is an outstanding collection. I bought this collection as a gift for my Brother and he absolutely enjoys all of the movies included in this Mel Brooks collection. I am certain that whomever purchases this Mel Brooks collection will surely be satisfied."
1,Oh brother,"The 2nd movement of the sinfonia concertante is just silly. A perfect example of ""just because you can play it faster, doesn't mean you should"". It sounds like she's in a hurry to get out of there."
4,Once a upon a Sweet Valley High,"I too am a SVH addict. I started reading them in my teens and couldn't stop. I couldn't wait for the next book to come out. I had most of the collection and then when I started going out with my girlfriends and bought my first car, I gave them away. I regret doing that now. Now that I can get them for my Kindle I will be renewing my teen years of SVH. At the time I got taken away to adventures and love lives of the characters and thought...... Now, I suppose it will be corny to read, but I will be reading them, even at my age."
2,Not as good as the old series. Disappointed.,The Sweet Valley High books written in the 80's were very clever and the characters and stories were interesting and had depth. Now these have been re-written to reflect the current times but I notice the twins talk like airheads now in this new version and the story and characters in general have declined in quality. Its one thing to re-work sweet valley into modern times but did they have to change what we loved about the characters? I wish they had kept everything the same and only changed the names of places and objects (such as letting the twins have cell phones now and etc.) instead of changing the characters themselves.
3,Die hard fans only,"Don't get me wrong - this is a good DVD, and contains all of the Eagles hits, BUT (1) Glenn Frey's voice has gone. He's too old to hit these notes now. (2) Lead guitarist Don Felder is missing, having been kicked out by Henley & Frey a few years back (3) the arrangements are dodgy - they have replaced Felder with a fiddler and a horrible horns section. Take my advice and buy the Hell Freezes Over DVD instead. It was recorded in 1994, and the Eagles are all together and sound much better. OK, HFO doesn't include many of the classics like Lyin' Eyes and Peaceful, easy feeling, but it's still a much better collection of songs, including the unreleased acoustic ""Heart of the Matter"" and the anti-PC ""Get over it"". It's time the Eagles retired. I'd hate for them to become a laughing stock like the Rolling Stones."
3,a world class cover band,"Capable but frequently joyless performances, largely of Joe Walsh's James Gang and Don Henley solo material and songs by Randy Meisner, JD Souther, Jackson Browne, Don Felder, Paul Carrack, and other talented individuals not on the stage. Henley and Frey are in good voice, although watching them grimace is not my idea of fun. The concert does get better as it progresses, and the band shows some enthusiasm when allowing Joe Walsh to stretch out on guitar, particularly on his own material and ""Life In The Fast Lane""."
5,like fine wine...,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this concert. After the 'Hell Freeze's Over' concert I was hoping for a little less acoustic stuff. The audio/video quality of this concert is excellent. Song selection is great as it highlights hits from the individual careers as well as the group. Think how many times (thousands) they must have sung these songs and you can appreciate the renditions here. Don Henley's voice is fading but it gets a little better after a few songs. The addition of horns adds a fullness to their music. I find myself still with Joe Walsh as my favorite; boy, can he play guitar.Glen Frey's 'You Belong to the City' and Henley's 'Sunset Grill' are two outstanding performances.This DVD is worth every penny."
1,Eagles,"This HD DVD would not play on standard, Enhanced, HD or Blu Ray DVD players. It was returned."
1,Worthless,"This item was worthless to me. I did not realize that it was ""HD"" and would not play on anything except an HD DVD player. I understand that Blue Ray has made HD obsolete so now I have a DVD that I cannot even watch."
5,One of the Best HD-DVD Concerts!,IMHO this is one of the best HD-DVD Converts!I'm using a Toshiba HD-A35 HD-DVD player which passes the DTS-HD MASTER audio bitstream to an Onkyo TX-SR605. The sound is Phenominal! The picture is great too! I would highly recommend this to anyone loving live Concerts right in their living room!
4,Video-WOW Audio...,"I'll give this DVD set an A+ for video. DTS is C- (minus). Sounds ""brittle"" to me. I like their previous release better.Edit: I'm glad to see others supporting the brittleness of the sound."
1,The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over,"Hi. I purchased this DVD, and when I went to play it there was no sound. All throughout the video I can see everything clearly, but there was - no sound! I thought perhaps it was my DVD player (even though it is an old DVD player, it plays other DVD well). So I then purchased a brand new DVD player, and I slipped the disk in. Still no sound. I was not a happy camper. I saw the refund requirement and saw no open DVD can be returned. And so here I am writing this letter. I wrote to them about my concern the day this happen. I haven't heard from them. I hope Amazon will see this on there review and contact me and try to help me with an exchange. I hope none of you are having this problem... Nevertheless I am clueless in what to do next... perhaps ""MySpace"""
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST,"The Eagles are one of the greatest artist groups of all times. Born to the general public with original songs in the 70's, they still maintainthat certain stage presence that gained them instant fame.This DVD set is well worth the investment for anyone remembering their continuing greatness.RECOMMEND!John G."
2,DTS Sound Disappointing,On Hell Freezes Over the vocal quality through my centre speaker is simply amazingly 'in your livingroom' quality. On the new dvd the vocals are diffused through the left and right speakers and are barely audible or blended through the centre speaker blandly. Also the addition of horn section and extra keyboardy sounds further detract from any enjoyment.Stick with Hell Freezes Over would be my advice..Eagles Fan
5,Lets hope this is the first of MANY farewells yet...,"A fabulous documentation of The Eagles much heralded Farewell I Tour of 2003, from the performance in Melbourne, Australia, the generous 2 Disc set includes a great amount of Eagle classics and favourites, 2 exceptional new tracks from their upcoming 2007 studio album, and a thrilling assortment of the best of each respective member's solo work from the 70s-90s. The Eagles are in fine vocal form, showcasing the famous four-part harmonies that graced some of their best recordings. The performances, instrumentally, are extremely impressive, and the extra muscle of the newly added four-man brass section adds an amazing new flavor to the group's classic sound. The picture and audio quality are all first rate, and one can only hope that this is a first in a long series of live sets available in the next decade of Eagle music."
4,GREAT CONCERT---BUT LOSE THE HORNS,"GREAT AUDIO - VIDEO AND SONG SELECTION. BUT THE HORN SECTION IN ALMOST EVERY SONG IS RIDICULOUS. HORNS IN FUNK 49, THAT'S A SACRILEGE. IF YOU WANT A GREAT EAGLES CONCERT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE, BUY HELL FREEZES OVER. MUCH BETTER, AND HAS A GREAT ACOUSTIC VERSION OF HOTEL CALIFORNIA."
3,Hopefully satisfied...,"I received this DVD in a very timely manner, but it will not play on my DVD player! I realize that this type of DVD will not play on a CD player, but I cannot get it to play at all. I have not contacted the seller yet, but am hopeful that this review get their attention and they will contact me and inform me of what to do. I do not believe this is any fault of the seller...just a bad disc!"
4,The Eagles Farewell Tour 1 From Melbourne,This two disc album is just great music and presentation. Disc one approximately 2 hours is slower paced with great music and performances. Disc two is phenominal with audience participation upbeat and fast past. You will not be disappointed in this purchase.
4,4 plus stars,"Great concert video. Almost all of their hits can be seen here. The sound is tremendous as is the video. I wish they did a double or triple CD version. I especially like the horns that are added to some old favorites.A couple of minor nitpicks:1) I wish Joe Walsh would not act like a fool . Sometimes his behavior takes your attention away from his great guitar work.2) They force a few songs on you that aren't close to the classic material.""Love Will Keep Us Alive"" , "" No More Cloudy Days "" and a couple of others could have been replaced by "" Best of My Love "" ( especially the great version that appears on Selected Works with the horns )or "" My Thanksgiving "" , ""Seven Bridges Road"" or ""Doolin' Dalton"".This is a great product , don't get me wrong , but I would love to hear a little more . Maybe another live CD or DVD is on the way . I sure hope so.P.S. This is better than ""When Hell Freezes Over"""
5,Phenomenal DVD,"OK, we don't even have to discuss the music....we all know it is superb!! But the cinematography of this DVD is amazing. I have never seen a concert-DVD that is so ""up close"", nor that has such outstanding picture and sound quality.Definitely will make you regret even more that the Eagles aren't touring!!!"
3,How is this possible?,"How can there be all these reviews for the Fare well tour when it has not been released on Blu-ray?This concert will not be released on Blu-ray until 2/26/2013.I would expect that it will both sound and look great, but there are no actual reviews for the Blu-ray version.Realdeal"
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!!!,"Best concert, best music I have ever seen. Truly spectacular. The Eagles are ""spot on"" to quote Tim Schmit. What really blows me away is they were this good since the 70's. I have all the old albums, and they were beautiful even then. They have always been this talented! Glen Frey made the comment ""It's not an accident the vocals sound good"" and I though that was so cool. They work hard at it and know it. Not like the ^%$# today, where bands brag about how wasted they were, etc. These are real professionals with God given talent and it shows. And they are rightly proud of that. I hope we are blessed with many more years of Eagles farewell Tours!!!!"
5,Excellent,This product was recommended by the owner of a health food store for leg cramps. It is a very well balanced combination of excellent quality nutrients.
5,loves it,my nephew really liked this gift. i was more challanging and it was different than we have seen around here.
2,Electrical tape for electrical use!,Only go with 3M electrical tape if you are doing any electrical work. This product says itself it is only good to -10 degrees Celcius. They state it in Celcius because most people in America don't use Celcius or understand Celcius. -10 in Celcius is +14 in Fahrenheit. So if you live where it gets 14 degrees you could have a problem.
4,??,"The service of Amazon was supberb for THIS item, however, Im STILL waiting for the book I ordered at the same time."
5,Great Extras,"Wow! Great treatment of this classic. The extra's DVD has behind the scenes footage of the making of the film from the 50's. The footage is lengthy and not like some ""token"" behind the scenes DVD teasers out today. Well worth buying."
1,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (Special Edition)","Oh-No, not another widescreen CD! Old movie that would have been good if fit to the screen."
4,Good Battery -- but vibrating mode is a little weak,"I bought the vibrating shortly after I got my phone this summer, I thought it might solve the problem about carrying at work with the ringer off. I works most of the time. As long as the battery is facing my body it works fine. I still like the battery and plan on buying a second one so I leave the original battery for emergencies."
1,not good,I think this movie would be ok if you who don't think too much....Some scenes were just plain stupid...This movie was a waste of time and money...Plus this movie is not for kids....
1,This was a nasty movie,"I was shocked at how low this movie stooped to get a laugh. It was an awful movie that was drawn out to it's fullest extent. The humor was crude and suggestive, and many of the main characters had swearing problems. The trolls were incredibly annoying and looked as if they had stepped right out of the '80s. The characters were undeveloped, excepting only the Wolf who did a very good job. However, I was disgusted at how sex was so widely accepted in this movie. This mini series was too long and too crude, all in all, an insult to society."
5,are you kidding?,"there has to be something about a show that makes you think and not even think in a philosophical way. For 2 hours for 5 days, suspension of the real occurred and imagination took over. It made me sad when the show ended and I await eagerly to receive the feeling yet again."
1,Not what I wanted,This was a region 2 product that my wife was unfamilar with the meaning of. We had to get a dvd player that could play it what a run around. The seller originally refused to allow us to return it and when I gave them a bad review they decided that they would give me a partial refund but by then I bought a player that can play it.
3,Fun Fantasy Movie,"I think this movie is fun and creative. The story is well-crafted and keeps your attention. However, it is often cheesy and has some bad acting. Despite that, I would highly recommend the movie!"
3,"Very good, needs retouched","I was obsessed with this miniseries when it first came out, and I bought the dvd to eventually share it with my own kids, but watching it with slightly older eyes now, there are cringe-worthy parts, mostly in the effects, wide shots, and rare moments of flawed acting. Oddly, I would say John Laroquette (sp?) has the award winning performance here. Comic, yet something tragic looms in his performance as he goes from loser to hero. Kimberly Williams (now Paisley) is also very good and I admire just how much work she had to do. The rest of the cast, meh, I would have chosen other people and I would have rewritten a few scenes. But don't let that scare you away from an original story like this!Worst thing: the cover art itself. While Ed O'Neil gives the Troll King an interesting performance (he actually gives him a shortsighted intelligence rather than mere stupidity, which is much harder to do), I don't think it should be his eyes lurking over the castle."
5,*I Love This Movie!*,This movie is the best!I love it.Great fantasy series.Makes me want to be there.A must see for all.Wonderful characters and great acting by all.One to watch and enjoy over and over.My favorite fantasy series.
5,"What happens after ""Happy Ever After""","For anyone who can take the time and appreciate this series for what it is, I assure you it's worth it.It's the story of what happens after ""they lived Happily Ever After"". I love to be able to watch a movie that takes me away from reality. It's about 4 unlikely heroes who save the fairytale 9 Kingdoms.A father and daughter, a Wolf, and a princely dog.Plenty of ""boo-hiss"" characters. What I loved the most was the unlikely romance between Virginia and Wolf. I was actually mesmerized by Scott Cohen who portrayed him. Can I go so far as to say ""I love him!!!!""Give this excellent series a chance."
5,I have always loved fairy tales,"This movie touched my heart. I fell in love with it from the first commercial I saw. It never let me down in my expectations. The movie is not for kids and that is why I loved it. It was smartly written, wonderfully cast, and beautifully staged. Hats off to Cameron Manheim as snow white. That is a scene that will stay with me as my one of my most favorite movie scenes ever. I can't say enough about Kimberly Williams and Scott Cohen, talk about chemistry. I truly hope to see a continuation of this story soon."
5,the best movie ever,"I thought this movie was awsome! i made sure i watched every minute of it. it was so interesting. its been a month since its been on , so i really hope their will be a sequil soon. I still talk about it to my friends and i know they get annoyed. i LOVED the wolf he was so good looking and a awsome actor. his part of the wolf was extraordinary. I hope i will hear more about this movie because just 10 hours of it isn't enough!"
5,A complete masterpiece,"I'm a big fan of fantasy stories and this is the best one I'veever seen. The story was enchanting from beginning to end. I can'tbelieve how 10 hours seemed so short. When it came on tv I couldn't wait to see what happened next. It was an original idea. I never really wondered what happened to the characters after happily ever after. As Tony said,""I never thought I'd say this but what happened to Snow White after she married the Prince?"" I hope they do another one. I love how the bad guys weren't all bad and the good guys weren't all good. Excellent! END"
5,I believe in make believe!,"I was drawn to this movie by the preveiws one thing caught my attention the ""Do you believe in make beleive?"" To be honest I expected the same old NBC mini seires Special effects up the wazoo and little foucus on the plot Boy was I ever wrong! The plot was wonderful, i love all the carecters, and the special effects were blaenced out... with one exeption the swamp seane. Talk about a BAD acid trip! I'm tellin' ya they should have listened to the fairies! In short I loved it and anyone who loves fairy tales has got to see this"
4,Delightful fantasy,"Like the Princess Bride, this one appeals to all ages. It has all of the ingredients for a magical mix of good guys and bad guys. Diane Wiest was a deliciously wicked queen, and the other characters had us laughing through most of the seven hours. It is a great adventure to enjoy on a rainy, cold weekend."
2,Good movies but be careful about the DVD version,"I' ve seen this movies many times on video tape when I decided to get the DVD version. I found that disc B scene 13-18 were all wrong, the disc skipped in the Shepard village sections (half the ""shepardess competition"" & the whole ""wolf on trial"" were disappeared) and the movies on section 14-18 were not according to the menu. Amazon was very kind to let my return for the replacement, however the new set of DVDs also got the same defects, also are another 2 copies that my friends bought from Buy.com (they did return them). Since the movies is quite long, you might not have time to view the whole movies after buying, please do open and check disc B on the scences 13-18. I really wish to get a goos DVD for this movies because I love this movies so much."
1,move around,i was very happy to get my movie till i heard it moving around in the case meaning it was getting scrached the whole trip. i mean what am i buying a movie new if its getting scrached on the way to my house.
5,Definitely have to watch,"This is an awesome series for anyone who loves fairtales. I watched this for the first time when it origninally premiered on ABC, and couldn't forget about it."
3,Leap Frog 3 dvd collection,The dvds are ok. I'd say they are more for entertianment than education. I was dissapointed because I bought them for educational purposes . For example; they say big letter D and little letter d but it should be upper case D and lower case d. I guess better then sponge bob and other garbge out there.
5,Another great learning tool from Leapfrog!!,I love their products. This is great when my son is tired in the afternoon and just wants to watch a video.....resting and learning!
5,Without a doubt...,"One of the best, if not THE BEST album, from Siouxsie and the Banshees. My favorites are:The RaptureO' BabyThe Lonely OneFall From GraceStargazerNot ForgottenI would recommend this album to brand new listeners who might be considering Siouxsie and The Banshees for the first time. It's a great starters album. I just can't get over how ""anthemic"" and amazing ""The Rapture"" is!Worth every penny!"
1,THIS DVD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS DVD SUCKS MY SON COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB RECORDING THIS!!!!!! NEEDS TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMEONE RECORDED IT AND BURN'T IT TO A DVD!!!!!!!!!!! HATE THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!
5,Best EMS book I've read,"I cried in the intro and laughed the rest of the book. I often caught myself agreeing or at least relating to the stories, and I'm still an EMT student. Devin's book shows the real world of EMS, not the stuff you see on tv that is edited and seems to be just the bad stuff. Sometimes EMS is just holding a hand or taking Suzy Psych Patient back to the hospital.This is the best EMS book I've ever read. It's written in a way that I could take it to class and read some on a break, put it down til the next break, and read more, all without getting left hanging in a story.Highly recommended book. If you are in EMS or have a friend or family member who is in EMS, read this book. It will give you a little more understanding of the things we see daily."
5,EMS The Job Of Your Life IS A MUST READ!,"My wife got this book for me. I just finished my EMT schooling and was looking for a job when I started reading the book. This book is so great if your in a emt/paramedic program or even if you just like listening about extremely interesting, gross, and funny things that your emergency workers go threw. I am extremely happy to finally see a book out there thats not about cops or fire fighters, which mind you are bolth respectable excellent careers. but It seems like they get all the credit now a days. I am so glad Devin Kerins wrote a book to let people know what the emt's and paramedics of your city's ambulance crews adventures, and lives are like. unfortunately they are usually very under appreciated. I have made 4 people read it so far! A MUST READ! AWSOME BOOK!"
4,The lighter side of EMS,"This book is a page turner that you can't put down, if you have any interest in the EMS field. Although if you've been in the field for any amount of time you'd probably run into a lot of what is written in this book. Devin does put a funny spin throughout the book on things that makes you laugh out loud while reading this book though. Buy it it's worth the read."
3,not as expected,"there's always risk with regards to authenticity when you buy online. this piece does not work well for me. first, it disappears rather quickly and you can't really smell it after couple of hours. also, there is not much spirit in this fragrance, it's rather monotonous and heavy. i agree with those saying it's masculine, sweet, and for the evening. way worse than, say, pi or le male. the only positive is that definitely does not bother people around you but not sure if this is due to the design or poor quality. 3* is generous."
4,Go for PlanarMedia 14,"Indeed, PlanarMedia 9 provides great flat panel speakers. I suggest you spend a little extra to get the PlanarMedia 14, which will give you much better performance."
1,"Drenched in Sound - yea, right?","Drop down menu doesn't offer zero stars and should have! Because I'm left with speakers and a sub-woofer which just quit producing sound three weeks outside of warranty and their web site (www.monsoonaudio.com) has been under construction for a month now. Their e-mail address (monsoonservice@level9sound.com) is undeliverable and 1-877-722-8346 number has been busy for months. So short of writing to their Monsoon Customer Care, 11782 Hammersmith Way, Suite 201, Richmond, BC, Canada V7A 5E3, probably equally undeliverable via U.S.Mails, customers are hung out to dry!"
1,"Great sound, but....","When I bought these speakers I was very, very pleased with the quality of sound and the sleak design. Unfortunately, after about three months I started getting distortion even at very low volume levels. I talked to a speaker salesman that said I probably just got some lemons. A contributing problem is that I cannot get in touch with Monsoon. Their site is down [www.monsoonpower.com] and their new site has been ""coming soon"" for several weeks now [www.monsoonaudio.com]. Now I am stuck with once awesome, but now terrible sounding speaker."
5,Awesome!,Delivered as promised on time and working great for my son! Glad I decided to get it on her. Loves his Christmas gift!
3,Could be better.,"Songs are very short (one page) and pretty simple. There is an interesting variety but if you are an intermediate to advanced player, you may want to look for something a little more challenging."
5,great juggling balls,This is an excellent choice for juggling balls. They feel great in the hand and the weight is just right. There are so many color choices too. Definitely an upgrade over my old hackey sacks.
3,Don't be fooled!,"Although it says ""Deluxe beanBAG"" the picture led me to believe I was getting a set of deluxe beanbags, not just one. So I had to send it back. It was also bigger than I was anticipating it to be. However, if you are only in need of ONE beanbag, this is for you!"
2,definately not Nullo,I was hoping this would stop the odor like Nullo does because it is a lot cheaper but it doesn't work as good.
1,THIS IS SO BAD!!!!!!!,"I think The cars are stupid!! They are only meant for little babies. This is the worst album I have ever heard and has a fewof the worst most lousiest songs in DANGEROUS TYPE, and LET'S GO.If you give this awful album 5 stars, I will be dissapointed...Even Metallica is better than this. Avoid this and go with all the legends of Dire Straits, Foreigner, Metallica, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, and Green Day insted. All of them will be legends forever. Want me to say it again? FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Cars suck, so please don't buy any of their albums."
3,????,"good album,but how can this be a greatest hits without ""candy""o"".after all,it is the name of one of their albums"
5,NO RIP-OFFS HERE,"Unlike all the other ""HITS cd's"", on the market ( NOW A DAYS ) this band and album does not fail to please everybody. IT IS PERFECT. Length and song selection is good. Some people may be upset that 2 minor hits where left off ( HEART BEAT CITY and STRAP ME IN ). BUT HAY!!! There's no room on the cd for them. ALL THE BIG HITS ARE THERE. Really, this is maybe the GREATEST 80's MUSIC HITS ALBUM out.This is really the best money spent ever on a great ""SUMMER .....DESERT ISLAND cd""."
5,Great product!,Read alot of information about blood pressure-- taking this with vitamin C helped lower my blood pressure by 15-20 points! I've been using these for about 6 months now-- wife only notices garlic breath every now and then. Usually if I take it too late in the day (vs taking in the morning)
1,"Cracked Dvd, not replaced","you people don't stand behind your products....the cracked DVD was never replaced, even after a promise that it would be....Shame on you."
3,WAY over priced for what it is,"It's a $10.00 game at best, NOT what it's going for. It loads slow, but that's okay. In ""Novice"" mode, the planes are hard to control the the ""sight"" spot is just that....a spot. Graphics are not that great. You can't see that targets until you're over them. If you ""time out"" in a game, you can't go back and do it over, unless you crash. The planes are cool though, and fun just to fly around with."
3,itsnot bad 4 being slow,I bought the game thinking it would be fun. its fun when its not taken 2 mins to load up and play with other then that its fun and enjoyable.
3,A good quick read,Although I did not expect the story to be over at only 66% of the way through the book I found it easy to get into and it held my interest right up until the abrupt ending. It was well written with an inside look into the world of homelessness that left you filled with compassion and wanting all to turn out well for all involved. Good for a quick read.
4,Very unsual story of the holidays,An interesting and rather gripping read but well-worth the time. It is one that I would recommend to others. I would like to read more about 'The Samaritans'.
5,The Santa Shop by: Tim Greaton,"A traumatic experience pushes Skip Ralstat beyond his breaking point, and he is unable to find the willpower to go on. Guilt almost destroys him, but hope finds its way into his life, in the form of strangers. Several caring people are placed in his pathway. Kind big-hearted individuals, with an overwhelming capacity for love. These complete strangers put their own needs aside, to be able to attend to their fellow man. Just moments before an irreparable incident occurs, Skip comes to the realization that he has self-worth, and is still needed. Then, he must perform his own act of kindness. His eyes are opened and his mind is freed from the remorse that has plagued him, he is then able to see that he has a future. Instead of destroying everything, he restores not only his own life, but gives hope to others as well. Very heartwarming story with lots of food for thought.Rhonda"
3,A Good moral book,Strong message but slow for my taste. I read it over two weeks as s filler. For me it wad enjoyable and I am reasonably happy I read it. Would gladly recommend to young readers.
3,felt unfinished,"The book starts with a happy couple about to give away their home and shop to someone.... then it tracks back in time telling the story of how the male became homeless, considered suicide and found himself in a very interesting town. The story that is told is very emotional and interesting, but given where the book starts and ends, it feels like it's missing so much. I wanted to know so much more about the Santa Shop, about what happened after the book ended, etc. It seems that (from what I can see) even the sequel to this book doesn't continue this particular story. I wanted more."
2,Merrell Women's Moab Hiker,"I bought these shoes specifically for hiking in warm climates. While advertised as vented, they still tend to get too warm. Also, I am having trouble with the left shoe squeezing my toes even though I bought them a 1/2 size bigger. They are sturdy and the Vibram sole is great!After trying to stretch these shoes around the toes, I have given up.......should have returned them within the 30 days but I ran out of time."
1,too small,Ordered my size but was too small. The shoe ran small. My other Merrell's (one I was replacing) was my size but this pair did not fit. Had to return.
5,Wonderful Shoes,"I have wide short feet and have had problems with shoes in the past, Merrell Hiking shoes give me the support that I need."
1,A poor thriller-- read THE OMEGA MISSILE,Clancy doesn't care about his readers any more-- that is obvious from this lackluster effort. Read some of the other thriller writers out there. Coonts latest is good. Also took recommendation and read THE OMEGA MISSILE by Joe Dalton. Great thriller.
2,Two lumps of coal,"Tom Clancy is my favorite author. Waiting for a new book from Tom Clancy is like Christmas for me. Today, I found lumps of coal in my stocking. All Clancy fans who want or need to buy this book should wait till it comes out in paperback...and at a used book store."
2,Pretty disappointing,"It certainly seems to me that Tom Clancy's political grandstanding seriously detracts from the story. It's getting harder and harder to wade through these massive tomes. Mr. Clancy's political beliefs have always been apparent in his work, but now he seems to feel that his novels are podiums fit for bludgeoning us over the head with. He always has been an excellent storywriter, but the dogma is very much overpowering the story. I find that I as I reread his earlier novels, I enjoy them less because of the civics lessons I was forced to endure in ""Rainbow Six"" and ""Debt of Honor"". I certainly could not reccomend this book to a non-fan, and fans should definetely edit as they read. I just hope Mr. Clancy realizes before his next novel is finished, that Ronald Reagan is no longer in need of a speechwriter."
1,The only Clancy I've returned to the store,"As a longtime Clancy fan I've picked up this book without hesitation the day it came up. Coming home, I breathlessly settled in for another exciting read...only to be throw back with all gentleness of a car crash. What the hell? Environmentalists who would like to kill all the people on earth. Well, gee, that's right on the par with generals who're just itching to start nuclear war in the believability department. ""We project 85% casualties Mr. President, but our way of life will be safe!"". Pfft.But what really killed it for me (besides the paper thin plot and cardboard characters) was the continuous exposition. ""And now I,Dr. Gene Evil, will explain to you my motives. In excruciating detail. And repeat it couple of dozen times so you don't forget."" Oh gawd...After the 2nd half of the book, I was reduced to just flipping through the book to find some action scenes, which at least were moderatly involving."
5,Finally Clancy gives us another book!! HOORAY!!,"Thank you Tom for giving the faithful Clancy fans of Clark, Ryan and the rest another great book. It is difficult to wait so long for Clancy's books but as usual the wait is well worth it. Similar to the excitement of seeing and old friend you have missed.I have read all of Clancy's books and they never fail to leave you wanting his next book more than the last.John Clark is the most exciting character in a book since Ludlum's Jason Bourne and Jack Ryan is what we wish we could have in Washington.Clancy has become the American Fredrick Forsyth with all the excitement of Robert Ludlum. Don't make us wait so long for the next one Tom!!"
2,Boring novelization of a game,"... and, if you like repetitive, episodic action, you should buy the computer game ... or watch six episodes of a bad TV show. The only reason to buy the book is to prove to your peers that you can read. Tom Clancy has, regrettably, taken the final, fatal plunge into complete commercialization of his waning talent. Very disappointing."
2,This is the worst TC book ever written! Like a bad sequel.,"So far, I have read and enjoyed all of TCs other novels. However, 'R6' ranks rock-bottom. After finishing the book, I began to question whether this book was even written by THE Tom Clancy I've come to know and admire. Over the years I have read other books on counter-terrorism, and the plot for 'R6' lacks plausibility relating to the subject. The plot and the characters seem to be out of a comic book. There were also technical inaccuracies to types of counter-terrorist weapons and tactics described in this book. The idea of having a powerful villian with the ambition to wipe out most of the world's population in order to create an eccological utopia is just too much like a generic 'James Bond' movie. Like my other TC books, I bought this book in its original hardcover edition. However, I am quite disappointed in this book. Cmon TC, I know you can do better!"
1,This book was simply awful,"Tom Clancy puts together a sloppy, unsuspenseful book in which you know the good guys are going to win, the lead charatures take things personal, and the huge plan to destroy the entire human race is going to be foiled.The was no excitement, nothing to keep me reading. Infact it took me over a month just to finish it cause I feel asleep everytime I tried to move a bit farther into this convoluted story.In trying to top the scare/shock/suspense factor of the past several novels in the series, we get to see a company with insanely homicidal tree huggers designing a new version of the same bug that Iran tried to use to stem population growth in the US in the last book, Executive Orders.It's a plot to destroy every one (except the treehuggers of course), and you know that they will fail just because that would end the series.No suspence, no excitement, no reason to ever read it again."
2,This is what we get when you incorporate a game into a book,"Like just about every other Clancy fan I was hugly disapointed by this book. I even felt that I had wasted a weekend reading it. This book Lacked just about everything that has made Mr Clancy wealthy enough to consider buying the Vikings. I missed the very things that made Clear and Present Danger such a good read. Excitment, and the great villians. These villians may be great scientists, but they probably could not find there way across the street with out a map and detailed directions. I was bored during the 3 days it took to read this book, and if it were not morally wrong I would return it and get my money back. Every one gets a clinker now and again and even if he is looking for a post Ryan direction this is definatly not the way to go! Are you listening Mr Clancy?"
5,Excellent book; Nice to see Clark & Chavez again.,"Another great story. I enjoy Clancy's original characters more than the ""Op Center"" series, so it was nice to see another book featuring them. The story is well written and the plot is something that could happen in the here-and-now. Definetly one of his best yet."
2,I made myself finish it.,"Because I have read and enjoyed many of Clancy's other novels, I was eager to read this one, too. What a disappointment! This book just plods on endlessly. It's about as suspenseful as finding out that all your blue jeans are blue. Don't bother to buy this one."
1,"This is the worst Tom Clancy novel, to date.","I am a big fan of Tom Clancy and all of his previous works. Having said that, I also think ""Rainbow Six"" is one of the worst books ever published. This book is living proof that Clancy's reputation and marketability has outpaced his capacity to write. The book is MUCH to long. The story line would have made a nice short story at best. Dear Tom: You ripped me off! I want my money back. Also, I should receive compensation for dragging this thing across the country on airplane flights. It appears you are starting to believe your own BULL@#$?. You owe us big time."
1,A betrayal,"Normally I would keep my disappointment to myself, but having read some of the five star reviews, I just can't. If you've read Clancy's books, actually read them, then you've already read this one. Tom just wasn't trying. The IRA are back and attack the hero's wife and daughter - Patriot Games. Baddies using a devastating virus - Executive Orders. The evils lurking under the cover of the jungle - Clear and Present. Bad guy becoming the saviour of the day - Cardinal of the Kremlin. And there's a lot more - I don't want to ruin what little excitement in the book there is by giving away the other deja vu moments. Tom, if you can't be bothered , why should we?"
3,"Too long, but somewhat exciting.",This book is really a great thriller if you havent read Clancy's other work. The book is too long to be an excellent thriller. Some parts are excellent but other than that this is a book to skip.
2,"The action scenes are fun, the rest not so much.","Rainbow 6 is okay.Positives:-Clancy is masterful at describing the Rainbow team's actions in the field.Negatives:-The book is way too long. So many of the chapters felt like unnecessary filler. Clancy spends way too much time with the people testing the virus on the kidnapping victims in the lab. We get it, the Shiva is a killer virus. We don't need a chapter devoted to every single time a patient coughs.-Clancy has no idea how normal humans interact. The conversation scenes between Domingo and his wife are painful to read. Steve Seagal movies have more natural sounding dialogue.-Rainbow troopers are too much like super heroes that can never be harmed. Every mission goes perfectly. Every shot is hit. The bad guys are all bumbling idiots. The only time they ever took a punch was when the Irish terrorists basically ambushed them. Besides that brief moment they were 100% successful at every single task."
3,Probably Good If You Read All The Others,"Like the title says, this book is probaly great if you're familiar with the characters in his other books. Clancy is a good writer, he's not new to writing books so expect something that's going to flow well if you're going to buy this book. The idea of the book is cool: a dream team of special forces guys from all over the world.Ding Chavez seemed a little mechanical to me at times, but I guess he's a military guy so that's how they're supposed to be."
2,A Book Too Far,I want a discount on a future Clancy for finishing this one. Too many scenes at the firing range. Too many undefined acronyms. Too many reminders of what happened in earlier chapters. An incredibly insulting ending. I chalk it up to author arrogance. A victim of his success. I hope he gets a wake up call from his publisher and rebounds with something worthwhile.
2,"Tired, jaded, ends with a fizzle",I am a Tom Clancy fan. At least of his 'large book' series. I looked forward to Rainbow Six. I was sorely disappointed. The characters wrer colorless. The plot was bizarre and the action sequences were anti climatic. The ending was a drag.
3,slow to develop,Takes a lot of pages before you learn what the plot is all about. Clancy takes up too many pages about clark's wife & daughter & her husband Chavez. About halfway through the book you learn what the plot is & then it gets very exciting.
4,GUNS AND GOOD ACTIONS mixed with some boring parts.,"The actions and training scenes are great and at times explosive. Unfortunately, Mr Clancy's habit of adding(and repeating) too many sub-plots hurt the flow. If he can cut the lenght by 300 pages, this will be one of the best thrillers."
2,Has Tom Clancy fired his editor?,"You have to wonder if Tom Clancy has fired his editor. This book is much too long. Which is too bad, because the basic story is good and the action sequences are very good. However, it would have been a much better book if it had been boiled down to half its size, or even less. In order to get at the story, you have to wade through page after page of pointless introspection, needless description, and unnecessary dialog. As a long time fan of Clancy's work, I was disappointed. == Come on Tom, you can do much better than this."
2,Very Disapointing,"I have always been a HUGE fan of Tom Clancy's books and went out of my way to buy this one as soon as it hit the stores. I am really sorry I did not read some of the reviews here first. I could have saved myself a lot of time.The book is WAY too long - the eco-terrorists plan is outlined so often by so many characters that I was beginning to wonder if Clancy was being paid by the page. Also, the typos and syntax errors are worse than any I have ever seen in a book being released with this much advance press.Overall, I found the book extremely disappointing. Clancy has gotten lazy in using the same characters once again rather than taking the time to develop new ones - and I won't even mention his portrayal not only of female characters but the way in which is primary characters interact with them.As well, his personal views have colored what was at the core a good story line with lots of action-packed conflicts."
4,great book,"this writer is one of my favorites, and this book is great too- as most of his books are. I will buy more books of this series"
4,John Kelly/Clarke,"I had already this book twice, but I wanted it stored in my Kindle. Just like other Clancy books it is filled with more detail, plots and stories than any other author I know. I like the book because of the John Kelly, formerly John Clarke character and his sidekick Ding. It has so much action, suspense and intrigue it is hard to put down."
1,"Double-tap the messenger, but I have bad news","Tom Clancy is running out of bad guys and plausible situations. The book opens with a potential terrorist attack on a passenger jetliner in flight. Lo and behold, the world's top counter-terrorist team just happens to be there, in transit to their new headquarters in the United Kingdom.While Clancy is known for his intense action situations and eerily accurate military knowledge, I had to force myself to finish this book. Will Tom Clancy kill off the ENTIRE WORLD? Take a guess. Read on as a group of highly intelligent scientists and doctors hatch a wholly ridiculous plan. Count how many times the authors use the word 'niggardly' and wonder why (I counted six). You're better off reading Clancy's 'Cardinal of the Kremlin'. Strange to think that a video game would be better than the book it was based on."
5,it was clancy at his peak,i loved this book the way clancy made it sound almost like it was happening im my neighborhood. my love for clancy have been roused to a higher level. i love it how clancy uses characters from other books like john clark(clear and present danger) domingo chavez(clear and present danger)
3,The decline of Clancy.,"Rainbow Six is not one of Mr. Clancy's best works. He uses the same ""menace"" as the last book. In all his previous books the scenario had some credibility, this does not. The opening chapter action stretches credibility beyond the breaking point. Even the jacket photo of Mr. Clancy is sad. He has on a custom made flight suit with the blue silk scarf, bomber jacket, scrambled egg hat looking like some romantic hero in his own mind. His politics shine through all this by portraying the Sierra Club types as bumbling idiots, referring constantly to Reagan Airport as though he were reminding us of his hero and a general trashing of the enviourmental movement. This will be the last Clancy book I buy. His story line is tired and it would appear, so is he. I'm truly sorry because his early stuff was some of the best novels I've ever read."
4,"So what if its repetative, it's great entertainment","As mentioned by others, this book does not have the most original of plots. In fact, I would submit that this is the least original of all of Clancy's work thus far. The Rainbow troopers are reminiscent of those in Clear and Present Danger, and the Ebola epidemic was in the last book!But it doesn't matter. This is a highly entertaining book, and it's easy to cheer for the good guys and boo the bad guys. The action is well written, and the pace continues through the whole book. We have nifty gizmos, a good body count, and all those other thing we've come to expect from Tom Clancy.As a scientist, there were a few minor points to which I took exception in his scientific explanations, but then the military is Clancy's strong point, so I don't hold these minor quibbles against him. So, I heartily recommend it."
1,Second hand copy for sale - only 300 pages used.,Gave up after about 280 pages - no research done at all. Mr Clancy should use some of his money to take a trip to some of the places he set the action. There is no ambassador in Geneva (Bern is the capital of Switzerland). Bern airport is a well mown field. BA do not fly to Bern. There is no highway from the airport to the town. There are no school near banks in the centre of Bern. Etc. (see review regarding Sydney also) In this day and age why does the guy have to smoke (a pipe) after operations. I echo other reviews about the length of the book - could have been written in half the number of words. Unless you think Clancy is the ONLY writer on the planet don't buy this book - if sales are low enough maybe he will try harder next time.
2,Bad choice,"If you disliked his Op Center series, you will really dislike this one. The slowest reading Clancy book to date, it'll put you to sleep. I've read everything written by Clancy and this is, by far, the most disappointing."
2,Irony at it's best,"As an avid fan of Clancy, I was a little disappointed at this effort that could have used 350 pages to tell the story. I guess the irony against the tree-huggers is that he killed a heck of a lot of trees to use as wasted paper. Pretty good joke...."
2,What kind of plot is this??,"I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books. And while Rainbow Six is not necessarily a bad read, it has some very lame aspects to it. The plot is so far fetched and downright offensive toward environemtalists it scares me. Also, Clancy's writing is incredibly repetitive at times. He uses the word ""niggardly"" 3 times in 20 pages. And he uses the analogy ""as regularly as he zips up his pants"" a couple of times. What the hell kind of writing is this? I was laughing at how bad some of the writing was. But on a side note some of the action sequences are cool, but again it kind of wears old after 700 pages. I wish Clancy would stop trying to showcase his extrememly conservative views through his novels. Tom, this is your readers here, WE DON'T CARE. You may be a good writer, but as a person you seem to be a total jerk. Get back to your old self and keep it real next time."
4,Another Must Read Clancy novel....,"Tom Clancy mixes true military genius with eccentric characters in this very imaginative book. The book may be a little too imaginative at some parts, yet the action is fantastic and exciting."
3,I just couldn't melt into this one.,"I've been a Clancy fan since read his ""The Hunt for Red October."" But I regretfully found myself losing focus during reading this one. The whole book gave me an impression that I was reading a Leggo construction plan, how to add another block onto the old ones. Of course, all the blocks were linked tightly and wouldn't fall apart, but once the sucker was completed, it looked pretty cool by Leggo standard, but it's also a creation in a rigid dumb style, no beauty at all, man. I simply failed to get myself involved from Chapter One, and this book only made me go back and pick out his ""Without Remorse"" off my bookshelf and reread it again. Missing something, buddy?"
2,Not the best book from Tom Clancy,"The story has some stuff that Mr. Clancy wrote before ,like an attempt against wife and daugther ,the character of Mrs Carol is like Mrs Elliot, and big mistakes . A good geographical research would avoid some mistakes. Manaus is in North Brazil not in Central part . Brazilian Army and Security agencies looks with care all foreigners settlements in the Rain Forest. Manaus Airport is also a Brazilian Air Force Base . Never , I repeat never, a chopper with a machine gun would land or lift without permission from Brazilian authorities. Best Luck and hard work will bring a better book."
2,This book was a complete bomb.,"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly"
3,Not all that good,"Tom Clancy is just going through the motions on this one. Until he comes up with a book that can equal his early stuff I'm going to read writer's who aren't going through the motions, like Steven Edwar Rustad, whose THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY was as spellbinding and powerful as THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. Remember THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, Mr. Clancy ? It was great!"
1,You want real special operations?,"Clancy doesn't cut it with this overblown, politically motivated book. Check out Andy McNabb's, Bob Mayer's or even Dick Marcinko's books. Or James Webb's classics."
3,VERY GOOD. BUT NOT GREAT,It's really a good story. But I like it when the end of a book is the best part. This is not the case with Rainbow Six. The best part is the first half. After that the story is a bit boring. The book would be the best if the syory was told in 600 pages instead of 800. But it's good to read.
1,Clancy outside his realm of expertise-Weak in the extreme.,"Proof that Clancy is extremely stale. I was left with a feeling that he threw this one together on a whim without much, if any, forethought or research. This was stunning in that Clancy is THE master of research and detail. Having come to expect that bit of realism Clancy usually achieves by a mastery of technical detail, Rainbow Six was an utter disappointment and waste of time. The story was so incredibly farfetched as to be fantasy. This, in itself, would not be fatal but for his failure to develop that fantasy in anything but the most rudimentary way. Rainbow Six is simply shallow. Even in that puddle, Clancy waded in way over his head with Rainbow Six. Where his research and detail usually provide an ample life raft, this time he sunk like a hefty 700+ page bore."
4,"A good book, certain parts held my attention....",This book could have been shortened considerably. Over all it held my attention. Going into military terms the average person would not understand.
4,Rainbow Six a great book,"Rainbow Six is a great book in my opinion. I liked it because Tom Clancy makes parts with lots of action, which is what I like. This book opens in Hereford, England where John Clark has setup a black-op organization called Rainbow Six which is an anti-terrorist organization that reacts against terrorist attacks. John Clark makes two different teams in this organization which are lead by Peter Covington and Domingo Chavez. Chavez and Clark are the most talked about characters and in this book their wives are involved. Most of the characters in the Rainbow Six group are from Tom Clancy's other books. Tom Clancy explains the terrorist attacks very well and how the characters would feel if this event really happened. Most of the events are very surprising and exciting. The ending is very surprising."
2,Clancy needs an Editor,"Clancy doesn't know what ""bad guys"" think, so he writes what good guys think bad guys think. His black and white view of the world works best when he minimizes character development and maximizes action. Unfortunately this book is loaded with the interior thoughts of his characters. Chop 200 pages off this book and it would be a passable thriller. For Clancy's next book, the most important ""good guy"" would be a competent editor."
3,A more 'peaceful' world leads to a dull book...,"It seems that the demise of Russia as a superpower has left Clancy, with little grist for his mill. Rainbow Six simply does not live up to his previous novels. I certainly don't mind a long book but this is more like a collection of short stories. By the time you get to the main point of the book it is 85% over. It also seems as though the bad guys have become a little to black-and-white evil leaving for some slim characterizations. Perhaps the days of large scale conflicts are behind us and terrorism will be the 'new' modus operandi but this book just doesn't sell it very well."
3,Not up to usual Clancy standard,"Much of the action in the story is great. The plotline goes from weak to weaker. The idea that the CIA would not even consult the President (especially Jack Ryan) before going to Brazil is pretty hard to believe. We are also told that Rainbow Six is a NATO organization then ""presto"" the CIA is giving the orders? An American AWACS plane is flying around in Brazil and nobody notices? This kind of sloppy work has not been part of a Clancy novel in the past. If I had to guess I would say that the people who usually read his books before publishing did not do it this time. This looks like hot off the press without editing. Not a good move. I have read, and reread every previous Clancy novel in hardback. This novel I cannot give an unqualified recommendation to and will probably not read again."
3,So Far So Good,"I'm about 250 pages into the book and so far it's not to bad. It is not his best but not nearly as bad as some others have portrayed it. If you are a Clancy fan, but, not a fanatic then you will enjoy this story."
2,This Book Was Ridiculously Long! (and heavy),"I have been a Tom Clancy fan for a long time, ever since the release of ""The Hunt For Red October"" which was by far the all-time best of Tom Clancy (as well as the movie! ) I was sadly disappointed in Rainbow Six for more reasons than I can list here. The book is entirely too long for such a limited storyline. The details strayed far from the well researched ""techno-babble"" that I'm used to from Mr. Clancy; who cares about every little movement the character makes, or breathes or sighs? Well I don't, it gets VERY boring. I read the hardcover...and it was hard! Hard to hold...darn heavy and I'm no weakling it's just bulky, but it's great for the collection and in the event I need a large prop. I have a feeling this book was written to compliment the computer game... not the other way around. Come on Tom, you can do better than this."
4,the ending was not his best.,good plot it kept me reading. i like recurring characters. the ending in some respects was not like his usual. before you always wondered what's going to happen next.
4,"If you've loved Clancy's past works, you'll love this one.","Starts slow, with Clancyesque jumps from subject to previously unintroducted subject. Then, about the time you've figured out who's up to what it takes you on a wonderful roller-coaster ride of suspense with all the proper twists and turns of a great novel."
2,Not the Clancy I know...,"What happened w/ R6??? What a bummer...I bought the book the day it was released and frankly had a tough time finishing it. I'm a Huge Clancy fan but am really disappointed with this one...a couple of things irked me, one was the repetition of descriptive words (can someone say...""niggardly""). And the plot had a Huge hole...without spoiling it...Why, if you spend billions on your ""plan"", would you send ONE guy to carry it out (to the olympics)...where's the backup...STUPID, STUPID. I don't know...I'm just very disappointed with this book"
1,Couldn't finish it,I have read many of Clancy's book and enjoyed them but this one is just stupid. There was no page turning. I didn't care what happened. I read about half way through and still didn't care. I won't waste the money on his next hardcover!
1,Probably the worst book Clancy has ever written,"Reasonable first chapter, then an incredibly repetitive remainder, not least of all copying vast chunks of Executive Orders (also not one of his best !)High time he abandoned this cast of characters, and tried something new !"
4,More of the same from Clancy,"The book was a bit long, and could have been edited by a couple of hundred pages. It was, though, very entertaining and a great story."
2,An autopilot Clancy book,"This book was clearly Clancy's most dissapointing. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it gave me something to do on two plane rides. I was initially excited because it was focused on Clark and Ding (Without Remorse was one of my favorite Clancy's Books). I agree whole heartedly with some of the other reviewers, the plot development and resolution left me wondering if Clancy actually wrote this one. Definitely not one of his best."
2,Ridiculously Long...,"Exciting story, packed with slanders to Discovery Channel buffs. I only found this one offensive: he used twice as much ""tree"" as he needed to with this adventure. Clancy takes much, much too long to develop his plot. Read this book only if you have an unhealthy amount of spare time."
1,"John Clark meets ""Op Center"", or ""Sophomoric Power Politics""","Tom Clancy has built a reputation for impeccable research and gripping plot lines. ""Rainbow Six"" fails in both regards. While I consider ""Hunt for Red October"" to be the archetypal ""technothriller"", ""Rainbow Six"" reads like one of his mass-produced ""Op Center"" books with a couple of familiar characters. Mr. Clancy has trouble differentiating between the strategic, operational and the tactical levels of warfare -- and although the basic plot lines of ""Rainbow Six"" are astute (growing threat of terrorism; danger of biowar; ascension of the multinational corporation as a mechanism of political power), he drops the ball by giving us shallow characters with only a thin veneer of credibility. I think Mr. Clancy does his reputation a grave injustice by pawning this dime store piece of pulp fiction in the guise of his far-better written Jack Ryan sagas."
4,Very tough to put down!,"John Clark finally enters the spotlight in this taut, exciting novel. As the head of the counter-terrorist organization Rainbow Six, Clark and his force must eradicate terrorist threats which seem to be linked. The novel is a real nail biter right up to the end."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest John Clark novel. The plot was somewhat predictable, devoid of most of the technological wizardry present in his other books, and simply just not that exciting.I hate giving away the ending of the book, so don't read further if you don't want to know how it ends. This is, however, crucial to my review.How can we like a book where all of the good guys win all of the time? In previous books, unexpected villians have committed unspeakable acts of war, terrorism, and crime. In Rainbow Six, the ""unspeakable act"" never gets off the ground.Those of us who find Clancy's novels to be a guilty pleasure won't stop reading his books because of Rainbow Six. However, I for one am anxiously awaiting the next Jack Ryan novel, hoping for a return to the qualities that have been here to fore a consistant hallmark of his craft."
1,An unfortunate waste of paprer,"It is hard to believe that such a gifted writer as Clancy could produce something like this book. Premise is absolutely unbelievable, many of the characters are shallow, political statement is stupid. Unfortunate that paper had to be wasted to produce this book! What is his publisher thinking?"
1,Is this Clancey?,I have read most of what Clancey has written. His first novels were hard to put down. This one is hard to pick up. Degenerating story line and dialog makes me believe Clancey now writes the outline for someones idea for someone to write to be published in his name and meet his deadline and he rides his previous successes all the way to the bank.
1,What a joke!!,"Don't waste your money on this book. This book is terrible! Since I read ""Sum of All Fears"", I've anxiously awaited each new Clancy book. Not anymore. I've likely read my last Clancy. He should be ashamed of himself."
2,Much to wordy and predictable.,I usually really enjoy Clancy's books. But this one is not one that you will read without putting it down. It took me over a week to read and I had to force myself to finish the book. Really not up to his usual standards. No suspense in the book at all.
2,Way Too Predictable,"Rainbow Six just seemed to lack that element of the unknown that won't allow you to put one of Clancy's books down. It was as easy to predict as a Disney movie. Other than that it was fun, and if you've already mowed the lawn and washed your hair it might be worth a read. Just too predictable."
4,Dynamic,The tactical detail outlined in the first operations is outstanding. As a former SWAT officer I believe that the operations written about are text book. While Clancy writes about some equipment we all wish we had his personnel placement and operational soundness would go well in a training debriefing. I found the ending very unbelieveable and a let down from the books begining however well worth the time to read.
2,Needs realistic action,"The idea is good. Anyone who thinks that this cannot happen has their heads buried in the sand. However, the story itself is weak. The ""good guys"" win way too easily. Anyone in REAL spec-ops knows it is never this easy. There is even some hints of plagiarism in this book. Tom, have you been reading Dick Marcinko's Rouge Warrior books? If not, and I think you have, you should, and you will see what REAL spec-ops personnel go through."
2,Wish I'd read these reviews before I bought the hardcover!,"I love Tom Clancey's novels, but you can skip this one. I was actually bored while reading this."
4,exciting,"follows the trend of Clancy, interresting and exciting. I always learn something from his books and I enjoy the read"
4,An Entertaining Slaughter of Environmental Extremists...,"You have to love Tom Clancy for giving such a compelling and blatant middle finger to all tree-huggers. Clancy makes these kooks very hateable in Rainbox Six. While the plot really does seem far-fetched (I can't imagine a Ted Kaczynski type having access to the resources the granola-types have in this story, nor can I believe that that many people would be able to keep their mouths shut about a plan to exterminate most of humanity), the threat of bio-war is a real one and will become even more frighteningly possible in the next few decades. Like the work of most of today's popular writers, Clancy's work will never be mistaken for great art, but he spins a yarn as well as anyone and has a Stephen King-like knack for keeping the pages turning. I highly recommend it to anyone who just wants to read an entertaining story. Unless you're a member of Greenpeace, that is."
1,Shagadelic,"I think I saw a copy of this in Austin Powers' personal effects when they thawed him out! Yeah, baby--do I make you ""hawny""? Oh, behave!"
1,not worth the money,"If you want a good book on landing babes, read How to succede with women by Ron Louis. It is far more thought provoking and gives you an honest chance at improving your scoring potential. This book by jeffries, is really thin. Like a pamphlet. and double spaced. It is a waste of time and money and Jeffries is a dork. Trust me, Louis is much better. I've read them both."
1,Ludicrous,"This only works for certain types of women - the bimbo airhead types. You will certainly never find a lifelong love this way! If these techniques really worked, Jeffries would be the richest man in the world! But he is litle known and obscure....."
1,Trees Died For Nothing,You won't get any woman in bed following this hypotize her and seduce her advice. You will humiliate yourself.
1,"Manipulative, Misogynist and Anti-Erotic","Eroticism is involving yourself in a playful encounter. Jeffries is all about exaggerated wounded male ego, evidenced not least by his need to ""pad"" his list of bad reviews with inflated ones of his own. Sex should be fun, playful, healing and mutual, not a stolen trophy in a bitter gender war. Heal the bitterness, learn to love yourself, and who you'll attract will much more likely be who you'll want to keep. No wonder he hates most women--look at the assumptions he's bringing to his social universe. We find what we seek. Honest readers, keep looking."
2,Uhh,"Ross Jeffries was profiled in ""Playboy"". The writer applied Jeffries' verbal tricks, and they did not work! The writer DID get a date, because he persevered, and got out there talking to women, which he admitted he would not have done without Jeffries' ""advice."" So the writer of that article basically gave the only (but not weak) piece of advice Jeffries has to offer that works (the rest is snake oil): the more you cast the line in the water, the better chances you'll have of catching a fish. Like the old aphorism: ""The harder I work, the luckier I get."" One of those basic rules we all KNOW, but few PRACTICE."
4,Womens Reef Sandal,My friend recommended this to me. I love them! I wear them almost everyday! I stand and work on concret most of the day. They are wonderful!! I will buy more!
2,Disappointing!,"This 3 CD set is disappointing. Close to 2/3 of the music is in mono, not stereo. The mono recordings are not even close to being top flight mono. They date from 1957 when many recordings were already being made in great sounding stereo. What Deutsche Grammophon should have done is to take CD 2 (all stereo) and the 2 stereo tracks off CDs 1 and 3 and combined them with other artists and made a 3 CD Richard Strauss Panorama series set.Just about everything on Bohm's 3 CD set has been recorded in great sounding stereo by Herbert Von Karajan. If I were in the market that is the direction I would go."
2,Too Bad We Don't Live In the Sixties,"Because this would be a great drive-in movie. If you want to be traumatized for the rest of your life by Loretta Swit's ""Mrs. Robinson"" turn, buy it."
5,great and fast paced,My kind of book. I loved it from the beginning to the end. I started reading and didn't really stop til it was finished.
1,Goodbye TC!,This is the worse book by TC I have ever read! He's clearly running out of fresh ideas. It would make a wonderful X'mas present to someone whom you hate!
3,Tom Clancy Audio CD,"The story is OK, but since this is abridged a lot of the story is missed. The book is very good but the abridgement ruins the story."
1,A total waste,"This book is to fiction what the ""White Raven"" is to movies. It establishes a base line of mediocrity and tedium virtually unparelelled by anything else you'll find. Clancy can't keep from editorializing about former real life politicians, and he also exposes himself to be a racist and sexist through the so-called dialog of his shallow and boring characters. If you see this one in the bookstore, do yourself a favor and LEAVE IT. It's time to retire, Tom."
2,Predictable politics a disappointment,"I've got all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books and have enjoyed mostof them.However, I'm TIRED of Clancy's politics. They can't even becalled right wing - more like blindly pro-government. Clancyis given to using his books as anti-encryption propaganda,presumably on the theory that the FBI and other governmentagencies are as honorable and professional as the agents in hisbooks (and there was no one else trying to read unencryptedemail).It'd be nice if it was so. Unfortunately, one incident in thislatest book was so outrageous as to be macabre: after aChinese policeman shoots a priest holding a newborn infant,a character comments that in the US law enforcement officersdon't shoot people holding babies. Apparently he has neverheard of Ruby Ridge.The Bear and the Dragon was an OK if predictable Summer read.I hope that Clancy eventually aims for a higher goal."
1,Not a Very Good Book,"I will be brief. Do not make the same mistake that I have made: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. One of the most unrealistic books I have ever read. Mr. Clancy seems not to understand the modern battlefield. Let me just ask you a question: Is it possible for the United States and Russia to be involved in a mojor conflict with China, and only lose 800 men? I do not thinks so. To add an injuty to the insult, China invedes Russia in orderder to capture a Gold mine. Now what is this: Fairy Tale? Mr. Clancy seems to have run out of imagination, and includes all of his previous characters:Jack Ryan, the Rainbow Six Team, and etc. Do yourself a favor: do not read a 1000 pages of poorly written, unbeilivble, self centered piece of work. There are better books out there."
3,"Bear Up, He's Dragon This Out To A Thousand Pages","In over 1000 pages Tom Clancy gives us a simplistic,an un- realistic view of international relations and conflict. As an entertainment it is first rate (although too long). Filled with action from the first page to the last, it is typical of what readers have come to expect from this revered author. Don't however expect this book to expand your understanding of international relations or American politics. In this respect the author has, very seriously, dropped the ball. Read it to be entertained, not educated."
2,The Bore and the Draggin',This book is a pretty good 300-page read; theproblem is the other 800 or so pages.Clancy needs a good editor who isn't afraid toslap him around some. There are too many wordswasted repeating the same point repeatedlythroughout the book with a lot of repetitiverepetition.This book is a Japanese sausage that hetries to shove down the reader's throat.Go vegetarian.
2,A struggle to get to the end...,"""The Bear and The Dragon"" doesn't even come close to ""Executive Orders"". For the first 24 chapters or so, you wonder when the story will finally take off, but it just goes on and on and on in low gear. I actually wondered if Clancy is paid by the page, or if there is some minimum number of pages to a book in his contract... If you actually get through the first half to two-thirds of the book, the rest is ok. I didn't expect the book to be as good as ""Executive Orders"", but I was still disappointed. Where EO was so captivating it almost read itself, with TBATD it was a struggle to get to the end."
5,READ THE MASTER....,"Without doubt Clancy is the master of this type of book. As always I was spellbound, barely able to find a stopping point. This book made me ""Think"" & realize that there is a NEW enemy... for all the world. The Dragon has been sleeping, just waiting & gathering it's resources.... Clancy is not the only one warning us of these future events, he just does with such style & so entertainingly. I did get caught a little on the roughness & crudenss of speech, but I don't doubt it was pretty true to life. Everything else about this book was right up there with the best of Clancy. Enjoy."
2,Clancy disapoints an avid fan!,"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since the 'Hunt for Red Ocotber' and 'Red Storm Rising', which I have read numerous times. Actually, I have reread every 'Jack Ryan' Tom Clancy book that I have bought or checked out from the library. I even took the time to reread Executive Orders for the third time before reading 'The Bear and the Dragon'. At least the third reading of 'Executive Orders' kept me on the edge of my seat. I ususally read one of Clancy's tomes in a few days.The first 300 pages of 'The Bear and the Dragon' took me over one week to read. This title never grabbed my attention at all. It must have taken me six weeks to read this novel.I would not rush out to buy this book. This is one that I feel I should have checked out from the public library; and not have added it to my personal libray."
3,Fiction or Reality ???,"I have been a Tom Clancy fan for years, and am half way finished with this book. I anxiously awaited a new ""Jack Ryan"" story. However I feel this book moves very slow and is hard to keep track of the characters. I think the basic premise is interesting especially since Congress is considering giving the PRC a favorite trade status. I wonder where fiction ends and reality begins. The book finally started taking off after I had read a third of the book"
2,Save a tree -- skip this book,"Artless, long, and dull. I plowed through it because it was all I brought to read -- a big mistake. Notably worse than Executive Orders in style."
2,Ugh.,"Been there, done that. A long rehash of what we've seen before - foreign country underestimates U.S., war starts, U.S. crushes foe. Yada, yada, yada. Some things ring very hollow: I don't think I need to see the two most senior people in the CIA calling each other honey-bunny; the same goes for Jack Ryan and his 'babe' comments to his wife. He rants, even more then usual, on Social Security, ""tree-huggers"", gays, and women (his Secret Service agent Andrea Price-O'Day). At 1024 pages, there is way too much character development and not enough action. Finally, the whole reason for the conflict - the death of a couple of foreign diplomats, *they're not American, Tom*, is quite a stretch."
2,swill,"this is the end of the road for my reading this man's work. it was to long filled with stuffer and unintresting. the continued use of four or five names for ryan all on the same page sometimes not only felt backward but disjointed. somepages required rereading just to figure out who was being writen about potus, ryan ,jack, president ryan, swordsman as far as i can tell all these descriptions for the same character make the reading difficult. not to mention unenjoyable, as i have enjoyed all the other books (they are slowing down with the last couple)dull dull dull"
2,DON'T,"I read the first few pages: Russian pimp gets blown up by a rocket launcher right next he Kremlin. Yeah, lets buy it! Page 800: Chinese will invade Russia, America will help Russia and naturally just manage to win with their high tech stuff. Why did it take 800 long pages to get to that point. In Clear and Present Danger I didn't know how he was going to make the action last 600 pages, but an Introduction lasting 800? Waste of time. This is NOT the famous Clancy we know and love, but a shadow of his former self."
1,Caffeine Addiction,"Tom Clancy is not a very good writer. I'm not sure he ever really was. He could come up with a story, though. But now he seems to have dispensed with the skills of an editor and allowed Jack Ryan to become his ultra conservative spokesperson. And without a credible story, this book is thoroughly disappointing. Demeaning to the Chinese and women, and with most of the characters thoroughly undeveloped and one dimensional, the 1000 pages become a strain. As usual, Clancy characters don't have conversations, they lecture each other instead. And they drink coffee. Lots of it. Anyone with a lot of time on their hands might use it to figure out just how many cups of coffee have been downed in all the Clancy books put together. It would be more interesting than this foul mouthed, misogynistic and racist bunkum."
3,Very slow up to page 300 or so,Tom Clancy likes to write them thick (1028 pages) this one is very slow up to about page 350 or so then gets pretty good. The ending takes up only one short chapter though and I would like the excitement to last a little longer.
1,Neither a Bear nor Dragon Be,"I intended to write a lengthy diatribe but had second thoughts as I would be saying nothing more than is contained in the other reviews on this site. Yet I am compelled to add a few thoughts, it appears to me that this book was hastily assembeled from a collection of disparate short stories and then clumbsily woven together. Making matters worse is incredibly poor job of editing the material for example in one passage one reads ""tax"" where its obvious that Fax was intended- Was anything more than ""SpellCheck"" used? In ""The Hunt for Red October"",Tom Clancy was justifiably praised for his research, yet in ""The B & D"" it is claimed that Jack Ryan brought out a security with the symbol SALC as an IPO out on the Big Board. The problem with this is that stock symbols on the Big Board are limited to a maximum of three characters. Four character symbols are used in the OTC market, NASDAQ. So much for research!"
1,No need to rush out for this one,"Mr. Clancy is lucky he wrote such good books at the beginning of his career, because he's trained us to go out and buy the latest one as soon as possible. This latest effort (?), with its lack of editing, decline of favorite characters (Jack Ryan as ""The Whiner""), and less than subtle soapboxing, is the book that breaks me of this habit."
3,Do your Homework Tom,"As usual with Clancy novels the book is replete with action and lots of details indicating that, in at least some areas-military for example-the auhor has done his homework. However Mr Clancy is way out of touch when it comes to life in China-his characterization of Chinese women as poorly dressed and with lousy hairstyles, dressed in boiler suits is so out of date its almost funny. He characterizes women in China in the same way Americans used to characterize Russian women and he's way off base as anyone who has been to China would tell him. I also have the feeling its about time he found a new series-this series on Jack Ryan reminds me of a similar series by Allen Drury-originally very interesting but becoming increasingly less believable and mired in right wing ideology. Find a new subject Tom."
1,His Worst,"This was Clancy's worst book. Yeah, I didn't want to put it down - it was gripping - but it was wholly unsatisfying. It was simply too fanciful. The good guys got ALL the breaks (to a sickening extent) and the bad guys could do nothing right."
3,"Entertaining, but shallow","I used this book to pass the time driving 2 hours back and forth to Houston. It was entertaining, but surprisingly simple and formulaic. If you just want some entertainment and pure emotional response, it's ok, but the book really lacks in depth."
2,What a time machine?,"I am a fan of Tom Clancy, mainly for the TV game plotted by Tom, and I have spent tons of time on that. This is the first book I have read by Tom. But what a Disappointment! As a Chinese, all the details, scenes, and characters Tom written could be real, but not at a time of 2000, not even 1990. All the Chinese plots may be true 30 years ago when China was still under the control of ""MAO.""This book simply reminds me the Chinese movies and books I watched and read when I was a boy in China. The time when every foreigner has one ugly face and on stupid mind.Tom simply surprised me that as a write who grew and educated in a free world, he is as stereotyped as those ""Chicomm,"" who are single minded, ignorant, and arrogant.What a joke!"
3,Too Much,"Too much unnecessary profanity Too much whineing by Pres Ryan. Too much Clancy agenda about abortion. Some factual errors. Lone Wolf Gonzales's last name was incorrectly spelled, It was actually Gonzaullas. Whine, whine. Gee I sound like Jack Ryan."
1,unBEARable and DRAGsON,"Give the Chinese a break. I found Clancy's redundant attacks on Chinese views and policies to be offensive. As a subway reader, I felt compelled to put a brown paper cover over the book to hide what I was reading. Sounds hypocritical but I kept hoping there was a point to the China-bashing. (There wasn't!)As an aficionado of Clancy's action writing I continued on with the book; however, I was dishearted at the often repeated paragraphs that were anti-Chinese. It appeared to be more a book on what Tom likes and doesn't like. Maybe Tom needs to travel abroad a little bit more.Villains should be people not countries. Find a bad person in a country's heirarchy and make us hate HIM. Readers can't hate the entire country!And finally, have someone proof your books for consistency and repitition, this book could have been reduced two to three hundred pages."
1,Worst Clancy Ever,"I don't read Tom Clancy books and expect writing like John Le Carre, but this one is a new low in Hardy Boy like prose. It also features a lot more of the worst written character in American fiction, his pal Robbie. Every scene this guy is in makes me cringe with embarssment that Clancy is actually trying to pawn him off as a real human. Boy's Life magazine has more real sounding dialog. If I had to read once more about ""fighter jocks strapping an F-14 on their backs"" (which we had to hear about, verbatim, at least five times) I was going to puke. Oh, and can you imagine a Tom Clancy love scene? Don't. I have enjoyed Tom Clancy books immensely over the years, and might again, but the next one will wait till it's out in paperback, if there is a next one. Maybe he just cranked this one out to pay for his divorce."
1,Does Anyone Edit Clancy's Work?,"After redreading Executive Orders three times, TB&TD comesas a crushing disappointment. The book is rife with typos, repetitive dialogue, longwinded xenophobic discourses and, worst of all, Jack Ryan (and most other characters) appears to have undergone a personality transplant and now curses like a longshoreman. His new VP (identity withheld) is a gross one-dimensional caricature and the dialogue within the CIA is excrutiating. ... Perhaps military technology has outpaced dramtic suspense as one series of bombs can now take out all the opposition. Its a decent first draft but hardly a quality finished product."
1,Never Again!,"I couldn't finish the last Clancy book and this one is hopeless. Just hundreds of pages of research by his staff, I'm sure and no story. Plus it bears NO resemblance to what really goes on in the White House. I will not buy the next novel from Mr. Clancy."
4,Perspective,"I have read numerous reviews and my feelings are both ""with you"" and ""against you"", but in the final analysis.... #1. You have to keep in mind that this is fiction, not the real world.....that is why all of us are Clancy fans. #2. Yes, it was kind of long and probably could have been condensed somewhat, but Mr.Clancy's claim to fame is refining his very intriguing characters to the best of his abilities.....and I would doubt anyone who is a true technocrat would say that he has not lived up to his superb abilities. #3. My bottom line.....GREAT----Very lively read and simply let your imagination run wild----as a intellectual excercise---at the starting point of the battle and continuing, draw yourself a map and plot for yourself the actual war stategy for both sides----FUN!"
2,Not worth the effort,"This tome shows multiple writing styles which begs the question: How many ghostwriters compiled this book? I've about given up on Clancy for any character development. Rainbow Six and The Bear and the Dragon show the same pitiful unidimensional characters. The conclusion was obvious, predictable and unsatisfying.For a good read, go back to the classics: Red Storm Rising is still his best."
1,didn't finish it,I didn't like all the f-words he used even when it wasn't called for. I spent 3 yrs in the Air Force and worked in public until retirement and still think filthy talk is uncalled for to get your point over .LOOKS LIKE i WILL JUST HAVE TO QUIT READING HIS BOOKS.ijfishcatcher
4,A page turner? Definitely.,"Although I found some of the same plot elements of Red Storm Rising in this book(i.e. oil attracting an aggressor (neighbor)nation that is economically strapped for cash), I was able to sit down and definitely enjoy this book. I was a bit dissappointed at the predictable usage of Clark and the Rainbow team, but I found the political dynamics, economical considerations, and social/cultural factors at work in the book addictive, and too compelling to ignore. This book was a remarkable piece of fiction that takes a close look at how ideology sometimes gets in the way of what's really important. It could have used a slightly better ending, one that didn't have the ubrupt ending comparable to a roller coaster ride coming to a screeching halt. While the story did have it's peaks, and it's lows, it takes the reader on a fantastic ride nonetheless. Definitely a worthwhile book to read."
2,If you can get through the first 900 pages it ain't bad,"Just finished it and threw it on the stack of the rest of my clancy collection. Looks to be the thickest one yet, although the stories have changed from ""techno-thrillers"" to Tom Clancy's view of the politicians of the world. He devotes hundreds of pages to setting up a storyline which is blown through in just a few pages. All and I found it disapointing, longing for the days where Jack Ryan was a small character and Jon Clark wasn't an old grandfather. I think there needs to be a new story line, his first books weren't so closely sequenced, and quite frankly a lot more enjoyable to read."
1,simply underwhelming,"The last time I tried to read a Clancy book, I put it down half way through it, never picked it back up; finally gave it to a friend who wasn't able to read it either. This book is about the same way - i'm into it about 250 pages and it is BORING, BORING, BORING. I can't think of anything good to say, so i'll stop here. I won't waste my money again buying another Tom Clancy hardcover. He goes on the list with Patricia Daniels Cornwell and Ann Rice."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing, in fact. First of all, this book is HUGE and you need a notepad handy at all times, in order to be able to follow the plot. I agree that the book sounds like a family reunion, but what the heck happened to Jack Ryan? From a believable and likable guy, he became a foul-mouthed wimp! I am sure that POTUS does not need to use language like that to get his message accross. As far as the ending goes, what happened? It looks like TC ran out of paper/memory/patience and just stopped. Or he decided to end our misery?This is not even close to his previous books. A thoroughly disappointing read, especially to all Jack Ryan fans, who anxiously waited to see what happened next."
1,Yuck!,"Too long by half. Wooden. Repetitive. Un-fun. Other reviewers have said it all before me.I've decided that Clancy must've made a New Year's Resolution to crank out some number of pages per day on this one. Or, maybe he had a bet going with Stephen King to see who could make the most money with the least effort. Whoever won that bet, I know I lost by reading The Bear And The Dragon."
1,Clancy now has ghost writer,"After a long wait, the great day arrived and I got to bring home the newest Clancy thriller. What a disappointing waste of time. Great characters are brought back from the earlier books and given nothing to do. Subplots are started and then forgotten about. Dialogue is worse than that found in amatuer submissions to ""Playboy"" magazine. Mary Pat Foley would never waltz around calling her husband ""hunny, bunny"" at work. Clancy apparently is running some king of contest with a prize for the reader who can accurately tell him how many times he uses the words, p--s, d--k, f--k, s--t, et al. He also goes on endlessly about the Japanese/Anerican spook's love sausage. If Tom Clancy really did write this book, he has lost what made him a great writer of thrillers. If he didn't write it, he ought to sue whoever did."
2,An OK storyline but.....,"the writing and editing could use lots of work. Constant repetition of certain 'cute' phrases is tedious. I was especially annoyed by the overuse of Secret Service codenames. Blatant typos should have been caught by good editing. The characters are not developed at all, and the way that he writes about women is sophomoric. I do not need to know Clancy's political opinions about abortion, the military, feminists, or China."
1,Clancy going downhill,I eagerly ordered the latest Clancy title with the expectation that I would be as entertained as with all of his previous books. Rainbow Six was gripping and I simply could not put the book down. This latest novel is dreadful and I was on page 528 when I realised I was utterly board with the turgid pace and style of prose. It picked up towards the end but finished in a cop-out manner. It would appear that this was written to simply meet a commitment with a publisher
2,The dragon ;and the bear,"I am 200 pages into the book. The development is slow. Reminds me of L Ron Hubbards Battle Field Earth, a 350 page book expanded into 1000 pages. I have bought all oof Clancy's books in hard copy, this may be the last if I finish this one. So far, very disapointing."
2,There is more than spell check,"This could have been a great book, but unfortunately it isn't. I got very confused several times when I had to go back and figure out what he said because of the use of the wrong word. I think I found at least 15-25 instances of the wrong word being used, example week for weak. Come on didn't anyone read it before it went to the printer!!I hope the next one is better or its on to Dale Brown or Stephen Coonts."
1,Disappointing and Somewhat Offensive,"This book is a only a shadow of the quality and storytelling ability that we have previously come to expect from Clancy.Contrary to many of Clancy's other works, this book demonstrates little or no understanding of China and even begs the question of whether the author has ever visited or indeed spoken to anyone who has visited China within the last 10 years.Even after factoring the necessity for atmosphere and a certain realism in dialogue, this book is clearly bigoted and racist in its treatment, description and characterization of the Chinese in addition to being factually flawed.I have enjoyed at least six of Clancy's previous books, however the Author seemed to be merely going through the motions to make some money here."
3,A Tad Long,"I love TC's books. I found myself skimming a lot of the detail in this one. I enjoy long books. The main characters and the plot are fleshed out more than their abbreviated counterparts, but this book dwelled more on the minute detail. I love Clancy's characters from Mancuso down to Meng, but I didn't get to know them as well as I would have liked in this novel. I am a bit of a technical person so the references to AT&T and Sun Microsystems (one word Tom) made the story more realistic for me. Still Tom Clancy is better than no Tom Clancy. The parts of the book that were fantastic made up for the parts that weren't."
1,heyho USA,"Heyho USA thats what I think after reading this book, One of Clancy's worst books (SSN is worse) and thinking I loved Rainbox six.While the politics part isn't that bad, the military part sure is, I think Eric L Harry's Protect&Defend is far supperior on the same topic (China invading Russia for the recource deposits).Its just insulting to read how supperior US forces are towards everything else, lacks all sence of realism here.(can't remeber a single US casualty)No after reading this one I hesitate to buy any new Clancy book!"
1,THE LAST CLANCY NOVEL I WILL EVER READ,"This novel was about twice as long as it needed to be to tell the story. Someone needs to introduce TC to a good editor, because there was no excuse for the length of this book. It really bogged down the pace and made the novel a chore to read. There was a time when you could count on TC for good tight writing, but those days appear to be over. He hasn't been the same since EXECUTIVE ORDERS. His earlier works are still his best. After this fiasco, it will be a long time before I pick up another Clancy novel."
3,He's done it again.,"Patriot Tom Clancy once again delivers on a grand scale in my opinion. An armed conflict between Russia and China that had me wondering about the outcome of all the sub-plots til the end of the book. You have to work at reading a Clancy novel, but, I feel it's worth the sweat. The three-star rating is just in comparison with his other novels."
1,"Offensive, boring, and bad, bad writing","I am a huge Tom Clancy fan. I have loved all the Jack Ryan books, and I always thought that despite being a bit obsessed with the technicalities of war, Clancy could really write characters as well. But this book was so awful I couldn't even finish it. It was xenophobic, obsessed with vulgar sexual references, repetitive, and badly written. Did Clancy's editor take a vacation for this one?"
2,Disappointed,"Clancy is an extraordinary storyteller, but The Bear and the Dragon doesn't cut it. 700 pages of buildup to one battle that fails to create any suspense. The few scenes with the Navy, are short and unexciting. The Air Force is tremendously outnumbered, but the air battles lack any real suspense. The tank battles are so one sided that I wonder why Clancy didn't simply say, ""All the Chinese tanks get killed."" and be done with it. That is the way you want a real battle to go, I'm sure, but this is entertainment, not real life. The Chinese politicians are so dense that never once do they make a correct decision. And like most of his last few books every character he's ever written is back. It feels like a high school reunion. People you didn't really care that much about in the first place are back, and now you have to spend a couple hours with them."
1,The money has gone to his head,"I haven't read the book yet; I just bought it at a book signing Clancy was doing here in DC. It was going to be a birthday present for my mother. However, even though I was willing to waste my entire lunch break waiting to have the book signed, he wasn't willing to take an extra 10 seconds to write, ""happy birthday Anne-Marie"" on the title page. Not to mention that he was smoking away the whole time. I don't think I'll even read the book now that I have so little respect for the author..."
3,"Simple plot, but still Clancy","Let's be clear. This is not Debt of Honor or Executive Orders (probably the best one-two punch I've ever read). That being said, it's an easy, decent read. On the Clancy scale, if you like the Op-Center stuff, you'll like this. If you find Op-Center too much like a mind-numbing, cookie cutter read, don't get this. I fall in the latter category. :-)"
3,Definitely not up to par,"Been a TC fan since '84 when I stumbled on HFRO. This book is definitely not up to his usual standards.Sure, I read it in 4 days and managed to get myself immersed in it. But it was about as satisfying as a warm beer on a hot day. (before you drank it, it sounded pretty good - afterwards, you had to ask yourself it was worth it.)Also, I'll just call attention the comments regarding editing snafus and excess storylines. (TC once said on Larry King that he likes to turn in a tight product to his editor. It doesn't look like it here.)Anyway, I will read his next one. Let's hope he can make up for B&D."
2,Not his best work,"Not bad but not up to par with earlier work. Plot is conceivable but too detailed (read: boring middle 600 pages) and I guess we forgot about congress and other minor details when declaring war on another country.At best, it passes the time - BTW - some seedly crotch novel stuff, he should get help from Danielle Steele or something."
1,A Laborious Read,"I have been a long-time Clancy fan, but THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON has been sitting on my bedside table for weeks unfinished. I can't bring myself to pick it up again. This is a far cry from Clancy's early novels which kept me up into the wee hours. I don't find any of characters realistic. The CIA team of Foley and Foley are particularly nauseating. Clancy uses this novel as a soapbox and his preaching became truly tiresome as the novel progressed. Maybe I will use it as a doorstop..."
3,"In the process of reading this, but people....","Stop complaining about the language. This is a military techno-thriller, not some childrens story. Expect the language, and if you have to, read around it."
1,"The book where the Ryanverse ""Jumped the Shark""","I read this book when it first came out, years ago. I had been a big fan of Clancy's work until I read Executive Orders, which was not nearly as good as his earlier work. However, the Bear and the Dragon was even worse, for several reasons...1) The plot was even more preposterous than Executive Orders.2) It was far too long & 80% of it was uninteresting.3) To pass the time, I started counting how many times Jack Ryan called the Chinese, umm, crab suckers.4) By the time the plot finally started cooking (around the 1000 page mark), the suspense was derailed by the random use of a weird obscenity.Anyway, it was clear that the Ryanverse had ""jumped the shark"" with this book and I have not read Clancy's books since."
3,"Great story, but wwwwaaaaayyyy too long","I loved the early Jack Ryan novels. Fast paced, unpredictable, lots of technical war ""stuff"" so I had high hopes for this one. I thought that even its thickness was a benefit: foreshadowing even more of what I like about Clancy's novels, or so I thought.Having just finished wading through it, though, I can only conclude that Clancy mis-used his (well-earned) clout to resist his editor's cuts. Surely this book could have been 300 pages shorter with no noticeable loss? Instead it would have been more compelling and faster paced. The repetition alone was tiresome (how many times do we need to read that Mao liked 12yo virgins, please!), without the Ryan platitudes. They were there in previous books, and they helped round out his character, but this time round... yawn.There's some great twists and turns and its a good yarn overall. But don't rush to buy the hardcover, and don't be afraid to skim."
1,Disappointing...,"After Rainbow Six, I told myself I would never read another Tom Clancy novel...but I gave him one more chance. I think I wasted my money. The Bear and the Dragon is dreadful slow to develop, wooden characters with wooden thoughts and wooden dialogue, too many sub-plots, anachronistic (has Mr Clancy been to China recently --- his China is not today's China at all). What's happened to Jack Ryan? Where's our decisive man of action gone? The book is far too long for the story. It needs a good editor with a sharp pen."
1,Clancy cures insomnia,"Clancy again disappoints his readers. Please - where is the editor? Cut out 40 % and the stuff might eventually become readable. The plot is highly predictable and very thin, the characters are at best two dimensional, with some racism added. Due to its length, this book ought to be a good cure against insomnia. There is too little action, the techno stuff is also quite weak. His politcial asides are hard to stomach. TC's views on social security: Who cares? Probably the age of the techno thriller is over. Anyway: If You want to read thrilling stuff, buy McNab, Bravo 2 0 or Immediate Action."
2,The Sum of All Formulas,"I have long been an admirer of TC as a plotter and writer, despite his occasional lapses. [But never an admirer of his ""as told to, but written but someone else"" Op-Center products.]With Bear-Dragon, TC has fully descended into Clavell's Disease - that syndrome which causes formerly creative and exciting writers to ACT like they're being paid by the word, which one should not do, even if one IS paid that way. Too many words (a fair-to-good 500-pager fluffed to 1 kilopage), too many subplots, too many characters, too many moral lessons.And the editing! Are TC's editors now afraid to point out to him that he's used the same phrase, metaphor, simile, or analogy several times before - a few hundred pages ago? It's distracting and it's unprofessional. Sure people will buy the book anyhow, because of TC's name, but those loyal readers are owed a better book - I suggest we are owed a better book with each outing. Bear-Dragon isn't it, Tom."
2,"Lacked some of the better ""Clancy"" writing!","Where to begin? At first I thought that the reading would be fast paced and exciting. What did I get? SLOW, over dramatic, tedious and sometimes distracting illustrations of the setting. I am a big Clancy fan and this book disappointed me.First, the many spelling errors and grammatical mix-ups where annoying. Did he have any editors, proofreaders and the ever-important spellchecker? Where was the effort in writing this book? Or was it easy money?The simplistic plot and over dramatic descriptions led me to ""skim"" over many pages. I did not want to waste my time reading the many pages of ""calamity"" written into this book. Where there should have been more drama was in the ending not in the middle of the book. The ending was comparable to one of those movies forced under budget by having an abrupt, simple, and unexciting closure.I hope that Mr. Clancy will take the time to rectify his mistakes in the next piece."
2,"Different Book, Same Plot","OK, I have read all of Clancy's fiction, and have enjoyed them, but he is in danger of becoming the Neil Simon of thriller novels. Like Simon, who has written many plays and movies with essentially the same plot, Clancy reuses an old plot, in this case Red Storm Rising, only changing the location and character names. He did the same thing in Rainbow Six, which was essentially a cross between Executive Orders and Patriot Games. I won't even get into the constant moralizing that he beats us over the head with during the course of the novel. We get the point Tom, you don't need to belabor itAlso, no novel needs to be over 1000 pages long. Someone needs to remind Clancy that a wise man once said ""Brevity is the soul of Wit."""
3,Would have been better if it was 500 pages,"This book was decent (not his best by a long shot), but it may not be worth the time investment required to read 1000+ pages. It should have and could have been much shorter...."
3,Pull Out Half the Pages & The Story Will Remain Intact,"President Ryan has his work cut out for him when he finds forces in China are moving ahead with a plan that, if successful, will change the world forever. The reader has his work cut out for himself trying to stay focused as Clancy gives us page after page of detail that sometimes reads more like a tech manual than a novel. Clancy's sub-plots are cumbersome and take a while to play out in this long-winded tale of war and espionage."
3,Too kind to liberals,"Yes, it's too long and loosely written. (Does anyone know who edited this? -- now there's a name to avoid....)Yes, most of us would have preferred more war and less limping along in aimless subplots.And yes, the Saturday matinee ending is awful.But...what's with all the pouting and hissy fits from leftish, oafish readers? The only offensive stereotyping in the book is the unnecessarily kind and fuzzy treatment of the media, along with a few ""Not bad for a white boy"" remarks. Is TC folding under pressure?Seems to me it's awfully close to midnight for the race-baiting, hate-filled ethnic capitulators who've dominated campuses and airwaves for so long. Is this what's making you all so mad? I do hope so."
5,awesome beyond words,This record takes you on a roller coaster ride where you don't want to get off. This is an AWESOME record that everyone from mom and dad to the twelve year son will love!! BUY IT!!
2,Not too enamored of 50s rock n roll and France,"This little film is a bit schizophrenic and a little too staged for comfort. We are in post war France, but we are also in a little American bubble as GI's bring American culture to a place that doesn't need it. There's a little teen love story mixed in here, but overall I wasn't entertained."
2,for the 70's,"This book is fine if you want to build old style entertainment centers, but if you want something a little more modern for your Big screen tv or sound system, this is not the book you want."
3,a reasonable introduction,"This book won't tell you everything you need to know, but considering its low price, it will give you a solid overview of the issues. I'm glad I bought it. It's generally agreed that no one book is adequate for a real estate investing education, so don't expect this to be all you need. His chapter on foreclosures is nice, but if you are serious about going after foreclosures, read a book about just foreclosures. Weaknesses: it assumed an economy that doesn't exist right now, and there were no principles to guide one in different economies. Other chapters only hinted at strategies but provided no meat. For example: flipping sounds cool but who would your customer be? It wasn't until a review of a book about flipping that I realized it's an investor who wants someone else to spend the time searching for the deal.I recommend it as your introduction to real estate investing.(note: I've not yet purchased my first investment, so mine is not the voice of experience!)"
2,Fair at best,"No real secrets here folks. Any mature clear minded adult would know 90%+ of this stuff. There was even a plug for his get rich seminars. It lacked so much that I read the book in in my spare time in 2 days and was left with thinking ""really? that's all you have to say about it?""Apparently some things will remain a secret."
2,Not good,"It's clear the guy playing the bass is a good bass player... but not a good teacher. He doesn't explain things at all which wouldn't be that bad if they showed you what he was doing with his hands but the veiw is so far away it is wothless. The only good quality of the video is the musical notation that goes along with the riffs (DVD Version). This is probably the only thing that makes this video usable. I like some of the other MVP guitar videos, but this bass video is not that good."
5,Disney iron on appliqués pooh and his friends,"I was planning to apply them on curtains. But the curtains ended up so pretty that I don't have to add anything. However, I have applied appliqués on the toy box. It looks very nice...."
3,Khakis were too short,"The pants came in after 6 days. Had ordered them to take on a cruise. They arrived the day before I was leaving; they were too short. Even though I have bought Docker's before at the same size (32 x 34). It was a lesson for me; do not buy clothes without trying them on. Luckily they fit a friend so sold them to him for half price.Went to Eddie Bauer last week, found the same style in 32x34. Fit perfectly so I bought 2 pair (on sale for $20 each)."
4,great product - delivery time a bit long,There was a far greater ability to get the Dockers I wanted through this vendor than by going to ANY department store. And the prices were significantly better online. The delivery time was a bit slow -- but the time was known at the time I made the purchase --- no false promises of fast delivery. I'm delighted with this transaction.
2,Defective Product,The stitching on the left front pocket was defective. I repaired it myself rather than spend the time and effort to return it. I love the style and fit of this these pants but I wish the vendor would do some QC before shipping the item. This doesn't promote repeat business.
4,Typical Dickens,"I've been reading as many of Dickens' lesser known books as I can find. This one is typical of the Dickens theme of self-sacrifice and happy endings in a fairly short story, with all ends tied up. The title and the setting (a former battlefield) are not really relevant to the theme, other than Marion's inner conflict"
3,Just average,"First of all, if you have neck and shoulder problems stear away from this DVD. After doing the ""Great Weighted Workout"" two times, I found that afterwards I would be in a lot of pain. I think it is because of the swinging movements you do throughout the upper body segments using weights. The third time I tried the workout, I used weights only part of the time, and I didn't experience the same problems.I would not recommend this DVD for beginners. I have been an avid exerciser, so I knew when to not overextend my knees, arms etc.. Karen, however, does not give that clear of instructions on how not to do that. Unfortunately, I believe it would be easy for a beginner to get hurt. As far as recommending it to those who are on an intermediate or advanced level, you will feel some burn. I would say, though, save your money there are such better DVD's out there like Jari Love ""Get Ripped""."
2,Bluck,"I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love."
2,You'll feel the burn...but you won't be building muscle...,"I loved this DVD...before I learned about proper weight training methods. Karen instructs viewers to do so many consecutive repetitions of exercises that muscles will fatigue, but they won't be properly stimulated to grow or to truly attain that nice tone we all want. Calories will be burned because you're moving around a weight for a long time, but if you really want a workout that will improve your physique, just start learning the basics of good old standard weight training routines--squats, lunges, presses, etc."
3,Great first 35 minutes,"The warm up is a little long, but she starts with great standing weights, and it is aerobic too, then she moves to standing arms, and then I turn off the video. I don't have 90 minutes time nor attention span. But it is a good workout, especially when females rarely choose to sculpt arms."
4,rising star,"this is an album that is begging to be discovered. this artist is just on the verg of hitting it big. you can already tell that his voice and songwriting style are well more advanced than Baron's actual age. his voice has a Hank Williams twang to it and the lyrics have the storytelling mastery of Johnny Cash. there are blends of older style country/western in the beginning tracks, but as the songs progress, there is almost a transformation into the independent genre. almost as if the songs appear in chronological order, beginning with his roots and earlier influences and ending with his own take on music. the song ""open door"" would certainly be a top single on the country charts if he had a big record label backing him, and probably will be if any label is lucky enough to sign him."
4,An accurate portrayal of the sea...,"O'Hanlon's book captures the sense of being at sea, the sleeplessness, stream-of-conciousness, and solitary life of a trawlerman. While some reviewers have found O'Hanlon's style offputting, I found that it brought home what it is like to be there. While not a trawlerman, I worked for several years with far too many sleepless nights on offshore drilling rigs. I recognized many of the strange non-sequiters, disjointed conversations, and random thoughts that passed through the author's head after 48 hours of intense work. And, the wry humor was much appreciated. Finally, for those you don't know an Orkadian to ask, ""neeps and tatties"" are mashed turnips and potatoes. Yum!"
1,Missed expectations,More pictures(they supposedly took tons of pictures of things you don't see everyday) would have made this book of incoherent babble more interesting.I finally tossed it aside before I finished.Overall disappointing compared to the early reviews. I expected more.
3,tangled narrative,"My admiration for O'Hanlon's previous work lead me to this latest,somewhat muddled, endeavor.Somewhere in ""Trawlers"" 330 plus pages is a decent 300 page book.there is much to like here; vivid descriptions of life on a commercial fishing boat and the men who risk their lives in this most dangerous of vocations,some fascinating(sleep deprivation induced) steam of conscious ruminations, and some real human drama.But there are also enough pointless interjections and banal parenthetical asides to sink a trawler.Och, Redmond! (Old Worzel), where's your editor?"
1,Don't Bother,This book was an extreme disappointment. It is a series of manic run-on sentences that are extremely distracting and hard to follow. It does depict some of the danger and difficulty inherent in fishing the North Atlantic in winter but deviates so often from the original topic that it is a waste of time. The author spends too much time trying to be eloquent and witty that one loses track of what he is trying to communicate.
1,boring incoherent mumbling,"The author travels on a British fishing trawler through the Atlantic. He glances over all the technical details of the fishing, and concentrates on the conversations of the crew. This turns the book into an incoherent rambling, jumping from topic to topic. It's never quite clear what is fact and what is lore. The book is similar to listening to random conversations at a cocktail party where you don't know anybody, except it is mainly about mating rituals of different fish mixed with British accent swearwords.I would much more recommend ""The Hungry Ocean"" and ""Lobster Chronicles "" by Linda Greenlaw, or ""Working on the Edge"" and ""Coming Back Alive"" by Spike Walker."
2,Could have been so great,"I love Steve Earle, and was really interested in a backstage look at his politics and tour. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't feel cohesive or complete. And -- although I've heard Steve Earle is quite a character -- I thought the film was fairly dull. Some great footage though, especialy the bluegrass show."
1,"Sad, really sad...","... and there was such great potential here but none of it was realized. Poor sound, poor camera work and way to much of Steve just jabbering on. Where there was finally some music as often as not there was taking over it too. I watched it once and sold it. If you want a lesson in Steve's politics, this is for you. If you want music, forget it."
1,Go rent something else,"Let me preface this by saying I love Steve Earle's music but this really is an appalling DVD.No doubt like many others, I was looking forward to this DVD, hearing Steve speak about making this album and it's subsequent reception from the public, the press and the politicians here in the US.What we get is a jumbled collection of live footage (which at times hints at how great a Steve Earle concert can be but generally falls short, especially with the Doctor Who-like effects) and some video that looked like it was shot with a Sony Handycam. I have no reason to suspect otherwise. The film has no thread and completely fails to draw you in. Poor sound, poor footage and poor editing will leave you wondering why you wasted two hours watching this - its not 2 hours long but you keep on rewinding because you can't hear what was said. This DVD is the musical equivalent of someone being given a fine piece of steak and deciding to make a sloppy Joe out of it."
3,For leasing commercial buildings,"This seems to be a step by step guide, in some detail, on the leasing of commercial property. It is not a guide for leasing other items like equipment or vehicles."
3,Esoteric,"I guess unless you have been, or intend on being a junkie, it's a very hard and disturbing read. One for the literary elite."
1,This book has no meaning!,"This book couldn't be more over-rated. I kept reading this book thinking it would give me some insight into the author or the drug culture of the time, but all I came away with was a lot of confusion. The author knows a lot of ten dollar words but there isn't a story here just many passages that just ramble on and on and further on. I want to know who are these people that rated this book 5 stars because they must have been either really high or have financial interests in this book. Take a pass on this book and don't look back."
1,Horrid,"A junkie's free association, stream of consciousness, graphically detailed wet-dream.Were it not for the obscenity lawsuit in Massachusettes against Burroughs for this book, it would have long ago, and rightfully so, faded into obscurity."
4,CRAZY-ASS!,"This book is tough-both with comprehension and on the stomach. Virtually every page has some refrence to sodomy, not that im a homophobe by any means, it just gets to you after awhile-thats all. If you can handle that much anal sex, baby, you're going to love this book-assuming you also have incredible patience and smarts to understand Burrough's hidden (!) points.This one might take more than one read."
1,Just waste,"The people who admire this book just admire other crap like ""rebellious"" artist (like conceptualists and primitivism) If you really looking for a good book read Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Do not ready this scum literature. With respect."
3,not just anybody,"I picked this book up after reading Jack Kerouacs 'On the road', but I must say that I'm pretty disappointed. It has some brigth sides, a sometimes laugh-out-loud humor, surreal characters that just makes you wonder if he was high all through the project, a language that absolutely won't disappoint you (pretty hard to follow though). But there's just no story to tell. I haven't read the whole book, and I'm not sure I'll do that. It's bizarre, weird and I don't understand how someone just 'gets it', because I didn't.The guy's probably a genius - a word-genius anyway - and I think that's just the problem. No normal intellectual person can understand his unfinished ideas and thoughts. It's just the cocain speaking..."
3,"Read ""junky"" and ""queer"" before this!!","If you read those two books, This book still wont make any sense. But you will have a better feel for it."
4,Smut For The Literary Adventurous,"Pure smut. But good. You will feel like you are on drugs as you read it. Some parts of it you will have to read 2, 3, 4, 10 times. Unless you're a druggie, then you'll get it.No part of this book is really coherent beyond a couple of paragraphs. Lewd sex acts come out pretty clearly. Violence comes out pretty clearly. But everything else is more than just a tiny bit muddled. Makes you feel like you're strung out while reading it. Who needs drugs?"
4,Burroughs IS the line between insanity and ingenious,"With a natural talent for writing and a drug-fueled imagination, Burroughs is truly one of the greatest writers of all eras.Naked Lunch is hilarious, as well as serious, and above all a great collection of ""under-the-influence?"" observations and notes that were put together to create an illusionary, unique, and thought-provoking novel of sorts. Greatly recommended to all."
3,A difficult read,"Naked luch starts out as absolute gibberish, and I almost gave up reading it. As I continued, however, the story (and I use the term loosely) began to take shape, and was even quite funny in places. It began to deteriorate again near the end, but that would seem to be intentional since it began as such.I can't say it was a good book, but it was interesting in terms of style, description (which was really quite extraordinary), and content. As for the rest of it I can't decide if I didn't ""get it"" or if there was anything to get.I can't recommend it to a general audience, but it may make a good study for those interested in writing or the drug-culture."
1,Wow...,"amazingly, a junky can in fact pen a few words while high as a kite. My hat goes off to you, Burroughs. I wasted plenty of time plodding through this and advise all others avoid doing likewise."
2,What?,"I first heard of this book on the VH1 Legends Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd Edition. I expect a book which discusses the daily life of a drug addict. I was very dissappointed.Aside from a few circumstances the book was little to do with drug addition. Instead, the book spends most of its time discussing homosexual experiences of a drug addict. The book is largely incoherent. However, it has been suggested that this book is best read like poetry. Even if this were the case, I fail to see any logic behind the book. I guess you would have to be ... well on drugs to understand this book.You can live your life knowing you missed nothing by not reading this book."
3,D.O.A:Dead or Alive,This was a comedy movie. The moves these women makes and the fighting that they can do is unbelieveable. Eric Roberts once again plays a bad guy and dies at the end. This is a movie to have around when there is nothing else on the TV.
1,A disappointment,"Writing for SI and playing in the World Series are 2 pinnacles of acheivement. While Mr. Fimrite is a long-time SI writer and covers the World Series, his game reportage does not seem to translate well as a book. The individual accounts are satisfactory, but the volume lacks the flow and scope required for a historical survey."
3,Arrived too late,"The book looked ok- however I returned it because, by the time it came, I was already in Washington."
4,An Early Treasure,"Ms. Roberts takes the reader into the world of collectibles and junk trinkets. To spice it up the bad guy is a ruthless collector who will stop at nothing to add to the art he has amassed by any means.As with most of Ms. Roberts's works, the characters are strong and likeable. Except for the protagonist, of course. You just have to dislike him. The suspense builds nicely, along with the romance.This is a book worth adding to your collection."
5,"So much romance, it'll make you shiver to your toes!","Hidden Riches is yet another great read from one of the greatest writers. Jed and Dora are a perfect match. Dora's family adds humor and depth to the story. Read it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Another Story From The Woman That Does It Best,"Nora Roberts has again done what so many other authors strive for - she creates real, credible characters with honest emotions. Dora Conroy is a little bit of every woman - strong, smart and human enough to be afraid of getting hurt. Jed Skimmerhorn is rough, cynical and emotionally detached, until Dora is drawn into his life and forces him to face both the past he regrets and the future he never wanted to face. An excellent story"
1,Final Examination,"I'll have to agree with Izzie, this was the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. Can you say cheese?....I mean really,it was literally the most poorly written film of all time! If there was an award for that now they might stand a chance...oh wait! The Raspberries, theres an award worthy of this masterpiece (of crap). Happy viewing, but really, dont waste your dollar.p.s. You know a film is going to be a winner when one of the characters name is Hugh Janus...I was waiting for his partner I.P Freely to show up."
5,Awesome book,"I loved this book, loved all the scriptural references, and loved the well thought out chapters. An absolutely great read!"
5,A must read for all sad story lovers,"Good, Night, Mr. Tom is a heart felt book about a kid that has grown up around an abusive mother in londen and when londen is getting bombed, the kid, William, is sent off to the country. While staying in the country, William learns to be appreciated. I thought that this book was great because it shows how one kid can change a mans life."
5,A Touching Read,"I first read this book when I was 11 and remember being very moved by the story. As an adult, many years later, this book still holds a spot on my bookshelf. I love the story and the characters feel like old friends. The changes in both Willie and Mr. Tom touch the reader deeply and give a sense of hope.One of my favorite parts of this book happened when Willie was in the hospital, and Mr. Tom snuck him out late at night. This scene showed the reader yet another great length that Mr. Tom was willing to go for this young boy. I was also moved by the mutual happiness between them both when the reader learns that Mr. Tom will be adopting young Willie. And as an animal lover, I adore the scenes where Willie forges a relationship with the dog.A very touching story that takes the reader on emotional ups and downs but continuously gives a sense of hope."
4,GOOD NIGHT MR. TOM,GNMT was a great novel and a great insight in war times. Willie has never experienced life other than the abuse from his motherWhen he stays with Mr. Tom he learns compasion and love and in the end calls him dad as Mr. Tom adopts him. He had never celbrated a birthday or even seen a cow this book is great for all readers at any level.
5,The best book ever,"I read this book a few years ago and it touched me so deeply that I ordered several copies for my friends to read. This book takes place during WW2 in England, and it has everything in it. It's filled with tears and laughter. I wanted to meet these people and be friends with them. I was so excited to see this author has a new book coming out. After reading Goodnight Mr. Tom, I bought all her books. She has a gift for telling a story. Have I mentioned how much I love this book?"
5,A wonderful extremely funny story,"I have worked with Ian Harris (writer/director) in many capacitites over the years and seen him grow as a filmmaker. Dual is my favorite of his films. It's heartwarming and funny. The talent level and story telling is superb. It's smart, yet somewhat silly story of fate, and well, lets say dumb luck, shot in the news magainze/mock-doc sort of style, that Ian has become so well versed at.Rating 13 up: mild profanity, sexual humor, robot vs robot violence"
2,Evangelion Rip Off,"This series was so frustrating to watch, at least for those who are familiar with evangelion ( a far more superior anime). Everything in Dual was stolen from evangelion, the main character was a shinji ikari rip off, and the two girls were EXACTLY like asuka and Rei. Even the mechs they had looked like evas. Its a pity that people would give this 5 stars. The length of it was also lame, it had 13 episodes, yup 13! and I think they chose 13 because its an unlucky number and the stupid fans would think this is creepy (something evangelion always has been)."
5,Rockin' CD that keeps your head bobbin',I don't speak Portugese but found that language is totally unnecessary for extreme enjoyment. I was especially absorbed by the awesome bass lines and obvious talent that permeates every song. This is an impressive album that sends me on the search for more Skank.
3,its a little pretty,"the one i got was:5% purple--45% yellow---45% pink5% green and the top of bulb is clear8-blue triangles-7 little 1 ,big7-yellow12-pink5-green (small)so mostly yellow and pink with about 4 inches of purple on 2 sides of lamp shade.im gonna buy another to see if its better !"
4,"""Amazing"" is not so amazing after all","""Amazing"" is the latest single to be released from Westlife's new album ""Face to Face"" and like the album is mediocre indeed by the band's high standards. I've always admired Westlife for the innate feeligs and emotions that they instill in their songs which are mostly replete with simple but sweet lyrics. But this new single falls far below expectation. The words are in dire want of a touch of convictiopn and though the tune is somewhat Westlife-like,the song on the whle is not a great one. ""Amazing"" is good but not vintage Westlife."
1,No way to make Labels,"They sell this product with a white surface that you can normally create your own label and print directly on the cd with your printer. However, there is no software with any printer I can find that will print on these business card cds. I tried to create a label using the stick on labels but they will not stick to the surface and the fit is not exact. The size of label I used may be my fault but I am sure I used the right size and no matter it still don't stick on the surface. I tried going to a print shop to see if they would print a label on these cds and they said no. The only way I can see to get a label for these cds is to have them printed online from one of the specialty cd providers and print shops usually used for mass production. In closing if you want to make a small quantity and your own labels use the round 80mm mini cd. They are not a business card shape but at least you can print directly on them using your own printer."
2,Highly Inappropriate- Be careful before selecting this,"This collection of short stories does indeed bring to light various moral dilemmas. However, the content is highly inappropriate for middle school students because of the graphic references to voyeurism, ""penile enlargement"", and other sexual content. There is no doubt that kids at this age may be exposed to some of this- but not to the extent of the descriptions in these stories. The stories will make students very uncomfortable and not because of the dilemmas so much as these references; parents will definitely oppose this as well. My suggestion is read the book first before selecting it for this age group."
5,one of the best,"Anyone who knows a thing or two about hip hop in general will appreciate this album. Definitely a classic, meaning that even to this very day i still listen to it. But for those who are into ""nelly"" to ""ludacriss"" or any other type of weak nonsense, i really feel sorry for you, your missing out on one of the greatest albums ever put out."
1,Nixon Lodown,"I have been wearing Nxion watches from their inception. All... yes... all of the watches I've had from them, the battery is dead in less then a year. 6 months ago, I took all my Nixon watches to their offices for repair and battery replacement. They gave me the Lodown due to them not being able to fix one of the watches I gave them. Fast forward to today.... The Lodown broke in the middle of the night. I woke up with the band broken off and the parts laying in the bed. I'm now wearing one of the watches they replaced the battery on. This watch is now losing power. No surprise by me. Their battery's never last longer then a year. I will never by a Nixon watch again."
2,i miss the old always sunny,"i am a sunny die hard fanatic. i have turned so many people on to this show. but season 6 was truly not up to par. i dont know what happened. maybe the writers were different, maybe its lost is edge. i dont know. but there was at most a couple good episodes this season. i really hope they re-discover their mojo and get back to what made this the funniest show on tv."
2,not the same!,i love this show! season five the funny started slipping. this season stinks. not funny!
2,Painfully Unfunny Season 6,"I cannot recommend the first five seasons of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia more. They are just the best of the best when it comes to a comedic television series. This season, however, is flat and painfully unfunny. I don't know if the cast is too involved in side projects, if there are new writers, if the first five were writen closer together, or what the case may be, but it is a shell of what it was. The dialogue and jokes are basically reused from the past five seasons and the storylines, although funny on paper, are flat and ""by-the-number"" in Always Sunny standards. Please come back next season, because Season 6 is a total, and consistant, pass."
2,This season made me sad :(,"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of one is because I genuinely am a huge fan of the cast and their work. That being said, this season had a few great moments, but really felt like it was lacking. I wish Kaitlin would have taken a break this season instead of parading around preggers. I applaud her for continuing to work through her pregnancy but it left a bad taste in my mouth as it felt like they were using her unborn child to sell the season. The last episode made me want to vomit. It was incredibly formulaic. It makes me sad that every episode was entirely predictable. One of my favorite things about the show was how shockingly funny it was. Instead I wish I could erase this season from my memory. I tried to tough it out to the very end, clinging to the frail hope that they would WOW me and it fell flat. If I were that child I would be furious and feel used."
5,It's Always Sunny!,"You can never go wrong with Sunny if you like the show. It's hilarious and wrong and dirty and bad, but so, so good! It's one of the best shows to come along since ones like That 70's Show and Reno 911! I can't wait til season 7 is out."
3,3 stars (due to bugs),"This could be a great game. The first game to give me the creeps since the original Quake. A good piece of work which sadly is so buggy that I lack words. If you see any patches (>1.3), go for it !"
2,Third-Rate Ramones Sound,"Now, I am a fan of punk rock and girl groups, (which is why I bought this CD in the first place), but I am not a fan of this album. To me, ""The Donnas"" sounds like the Ramones would if they were A)bad and B)girls. This album is also quite long considering the fact that basically all the songs sound the same. From what I've heard from them The Donnas have improved greatly since this album, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from getting into them...I would, however, discourage them from buying this specific album. Go for some more recent stuff and maybe work your way back to this one eventually."
3,3.5 Stars.... Donnas' First Album is Low-Fi But Fun,"The Donnas self-released their debut album in 1997 (it was re-released a year later by Lookout! Records). It's amazing to see how in a matter of 5 years the Donnas have musically matured from this to the 2002 album ""Spend the Night"".""The Donnas"" (23 tracks, 41 min.--and that's not a typo!) is in essence one long track, as all the songs pretty much feature the same three chord riff. For that reason it's difficult to point out highlights, although the 2 covers (the Beach Boys' ""Drive-In"" and Phil Spector's ""Da Doo Run Run"") are hilarious. The sound is definitely low-fi, and in a strange way it's quite fitting with the overall feel of the album.In all, this is a fun, but certainly not an essential album for anyone who, like me, thought that ""Spend the Night"" was a great album. The Donnas show us how the Ramones live on!"
1,It sucked,nothin like the old one..so much slower hard to countrol and even complicated...its a waste of money!
5,The endless possiblities,"This is not a game, It's the next closest thing to real flying. Make sure you have a fast PC and MS Force Feedback joystick is a must. Check out the great website where you can download everything to make your own virtual flying world."
1,The System Requirements are Very Misleading,"The packaging states minimum requirements P166 32MB RAM, however the game is unplayable on my system which is a P200 64MB RAM. The graphics remind me of games I played on my old half meg Amiga and the speed is slower than a snail feeling under the weather. Unless you have a fast computer (and I mean fast) DO NOT buy this game. Microsoft is cheating you seriously by stating such low requirements. DO NOT BUY."
4,Private Pilot Certification,"one thing I really enjoyed about this program is finally being able to have our efforts as an armchair pilot noticed. With this program, you can take a private pilot checkride, and upon passing, be presented with a printable award. You can then go on to get an insturment rating, commercial license, and air transport license. The planes are equipped with gps and moving map display, which really helps navigating. The weather effects are much better with this program, you can actually see the rain, and the wind shear is very realistic. You will need a fairly quick computer to run the program, in order to get a decent frame rate. I use a 400 mhz machine and get about 27 frm/sec, which looks OK. With the rebate from Microsoft, you really cant go wrong if you enjoy flying."
3,Not Lenmar,"To be fair, I haven't checked this battery yet to see how it performs. But - to echo another review - this is NOT a Lenmar battery as claimed in this listing. The Lenmar name/logo appears nowhere on the battery or packaging (even though the invoice included with the shipment said it was a Lenmar battery). It may be a great battery, but it appears to be some generic off-brand and therefore falsely claims to be a name brand. Just to make you aware..."
4,Good tape,"This is an ok tape. I prefer not to use the see through tape, though that works just as well. I have used the dymo letra for about two years and I have noticed that after this time, it only prints half of the letters ...it might be the batteries need to be replaced, but one letra that I bought, though I replaced the batteries I still had the same problems...but it is great when it works right."
4,Don't forget the batteries!,"I bought this tape to replace the empty tape in my Dymo label printer, and the results were initially highly disappointing. The letters were extremely faint and vertical lines were entirely absent. I assumed this was a problem with the tape since the last tape had worked fine. However, a comment on an earlier version of this review suggested replacing the printer's batteries, and that entirely fixed the problem.So, the product works as it should. If it doesn't print well for you, try replacing your batteries, especially if you use it infrequently, as I do.The labels aren't quite as sticky as I'd like them to be, as others have noted. I've found them especially troublesome on plastic surfaces."
4,"Peels off cleanly, but turns brown and falls off when boiled","We use these to label plastic bottles of frozen expressed breastmilk with the date they were pumped. We used to useDymo 10697 1/2in X 13ft Letratag White Paper Tape (2-Tapes), but it was a pain to scrape off with mour fingernails and frequently didn't come off cleanly (especially after getting wet from boiling in water to defrost the milk). This product peels off easily and cleanly, but after we boil the labeled bottles, the labels turn brown and fall off. Because we rarely have more than one bottle in circulation, we don't really need to know the date once the bottle's been defrosted, so we still prefer this plastic tape to the paper tape we were using before."
2,For the love of melancholy...,"The Luther remake is solid, but not spectacular. After that, its little more a litany of music and lyrics about love gone bad. No dynamics, and very little real emotion. Perhaps indifferent or apathetic could be used to describe the feeling this record evokes; a feeling that is neither too hot or too cold but not just right. Fortunately for us, Lalah's voice is just warm enough to prevent you from wanting to spew this disc out of your collection. She has yet to release record as good as her debut. But then again some of her father's records were a bit uneven, so I guess those genetics extend to Lalah's music also. Still, I'd buy this just because she is just plain beautiful, both physically and vocally. Hopefully the music will catch up someday."
3,Nice,I've only discovered Laylah Hathaway only recently when i heard her remake of Luther's song. I had to find it. I decided to buy her album just because of the song. But I heard the entire thing and it's not bad at all. It's not a 5 star album but it's decent.
3,Hmmm...Coulda Been Better,"The music world waited 10 years for Lalah Hathaway to drop her 3rd solo release. The voice is still there....fine and smooth as ever. However, the song selections could have been stronger. Ironically, ""Stronger"" is the title of one of the songs on the cd. It is one of the best songs featured with a nice uptempo groove. Other tracks to take notice of are ""Back Then"", ""If U Ever"" and a beautiful tribute/remake to Luther Vandross with his song ""Forever, For Always, For Love."" Sadly to say beyond that, I found the remaining songs boring. Once again, there is no question about Lalah's singing ability but these songs in my opinion do not truly showcase her talent. I love you Lalah but I just couldn't get into this cd."
1,What is all this fuss ? Can't listen till the end....boring.,"I tried,I tried many times to go through all CD,I couldn't !From the first listen it comes across as smooth and soulful.That said,it's bland and boring,and out of touch in terms of making any kind of impact.It flows inoffensively from one track to another one and that's the problem - nothing stands out - except the song 'Forever,for always,for love'.Definitely,this is the ONLY good song from 'Outrun The Sky'.So,skip this CD and buy the tribute album 'V.A.-Forever,for always for Luther"",where you can find the same,same song.File 'Outrun the Sky' under : Snooze ."
5,bobbsey twins at meadow brook,I. loved the bobbsey twins as a child when my mother read them to me and I read the to my younger sisters. I have a set of twins and they think it is great to have stories about twins
1,BAD print,One of the images in the book was printed several times on one page not giving way for that part of the text. Several lines ruined on another page because of some black spot. Footnotes barely readable. I would recommend printing it straight off Google books. Very disappointed.
4,Too big for me,Great pot and well made but i bought it for a stove top (my mistake not theirs). it takes 20 minutes to steam and boil on my smoothtop electric stove (using two burners). The large size and basket are great for lobsters but this pot is best for an outdoor system or a large industrial stove burner. It is just too big for my wife to handle.Be forwarned it's a great value butbig!
2,Burrrr,"Both cruets have glass burs on the trim rings located on the handles. If you are not willing to take them and have them removed, I would not purchase them....For their cost, I expected a better quality product. Buyer burr ware."
4,Hot hot hot not your typical everyday novel,this book is amazing. It is filled with twists and turns. Just when I thought I had a handle on the story something happens to trip me up. I love the fact that Denise Campbell was able to build the characters to the point that I felt like I knew them personally. I was emotionally drawn into the characters problems before I knew it.I was on an emotional roller coaster and I couldnt get enough. I didnt wnat to know what was going to happen in the end yet I couldnt put it down. This book is wonderful and I recommend it highly
5,Perfect!!!,The veil was absolutely perfect! The crystals were beautiful and I had so many complements on my veil. Very happy.
4,Rock and Roll Revolution,"Survival of the Sickest is one of my favorite new CD's. And that is definitely saying something since I have over 100 great rock CD's. All things Rock is all I'm about. This CD is definitely a great improvement form their last two, and you can definitely see their 80's influences in this CD. There are twelve great tracks (including the bonus track), and they are all either kick-ass rock and roll or softer, emotional songs that blend in beautifully with the guitars.The singer, Josey Scott, is great at screaming while still being able to sing those beautiful ballads. He my look a little weird, but all I car about is the music, and in that department, he is unscathed. (I like that analogy). The saliva gutarist is also amazing and has improved greatly. He is extremely undrated, and doesn't deserve to be. Every track has a great guitar solo that rivals the best.This is a definite must for every rock fan, nomatter what style you like, it is absolutely amazing."
5,ALL GREAT SONGS HERE,Wish you were here is the best album after the dark side of the moon.This is certainly better than the wall and all the songs are great especially Shine on you crazy diamond.You certainly need to have this masterpiece in your collection.
2,Bad Titles on the Disks,"The labeling on these disks were terrible!! When burned on itunes, there is no word on the titles that the disk is digitally remastered, which make you wonder if the music is really digitally remastered. Also, there was no artwork on either wish ou were here, and the dark side of the moon imersion sets. I know if you want you can manually do all that, but one would expect better than this from always-perfect Pink Floyd."
3,one of Floyd's best,"Dark Side and Animals are insults to the record-buying public. Wish You Were Here, preceded by Dark Side and followed by Animals, is a surprisingly stripped-down and unpretentious CD, a small masterpiece. All the songs are memorable, the psychedelic stuff doesn't get in the way, it's a Pink Floyd album which really doesn't sound like one. Is it essential to non-fans? Nah, but it's good enough. Bottom line: If you've never bought a Pink Floyd CD, buy this one instead of The Wall or Dark Side."
5,"Not Just Rock,,,More so Classical to me!!","I have always Loved Pink Floyd,,,,so many believe it to be Rock,,,I strongly catgorize it as Classical Music....They are Great!! Must also have ""The Wall"" and watch / Purchase the DVD to Understand the Song and It's reasoning!!"
5,Best Floyd Album!,Beast floyd album of all time! It beats the hell-o out of greatest hits or darkside of the moon!
5,Wish granted,"Cut-for-cut, this is probably the best album Pink Floyd ever released: passionate, pained, straightforward, and even powerful in a way that doesn't require the listener to be hyped up and out of their mind on LSD. The merits of ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"" might be debatable (less so the second half), but there's no debating the power of the rolling satire ""Have a Cigar"" or the even poignant ""Wish You Were Here."" The effects-heavy ""Welcome to the Machine"" even hits the spot. It's ironic that the band members have said that they weren't really ""here"" during the recording sessions, because they've never sounded more ""here"" on any other album."
5,A Wonderful Mix To Create an Excellent Album,"(...) Of the albums I've heard from Pink Floyd (which include Darkside of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, The Wall, and this), this one is probably my favorite, with the others not too far behind. The album mixes several types of music including some jazzy sounding tunes, some classic rock sounding tunes, and dance type music in a way that makes all of them sound much better than they normally would. As for the album being made for a former band member, I don't really know much about that; but I do know that this is an incredibly good, relaxing album that no Pink Floyd fan should be without."
3,Review for box set not the music.,"First off,this is probably my all time favorite Floyd record.But this ""immersion"" set is way overpriced for what you actually get.Hell,I wouldve been happy if theyd made a double cd comprised of discs 1 and 2.Maybe I'm a bit stupid but when I saw the dvd contained ""concert screen films"",I thought there would be ""Live"" footage.Oh well at least the remastering is stellar and the live audio is fantastic."
5,GREATEST ALBUM EVER,"Maybe , maybe not but certainly 1 of the all time best albums ever laid to wax and now available for your digital collection right here at Amazon , what's not to love ?"
3,Great Small Horrible Pump,"Like some of the 5 star reviews of this product I too like the smell and have received numerous compliments on the fragrance by perfect strangers. However and unfortunately the pump mechanism for the cologne is awful. It worked fine in the first couple of usages and then barely pumps well after that. In addition the poor pumping results in a slow leak from he cap area. As I store my cologne on my wooden dresser, the result of this leak has left a stain that has blemished it to the point where I will not purchase this product again.It is a shame, it is a great fragrance. Just a horrible spray mechanism."
3,"WARNING: Same Book, Different Title.","I only gave this book three stars because it is the same book as ""Victoria Sweet Baking"" -- same content, same errors, etc., only difference is the title."
4,Tak is back! and with a twist!,"Tak the great Juju chalange is an incredibly fun game.After hearing my favorite warrior made another game,I got pretty exited.While the control scheme is unorthadox,I found this game easy to reccomend to anyone who doesn't get seizures.And the funy movie sequences made me go through the roofGraphics:9/10 some of the backrounds are beutiful.Music:7/10 kinda distracting.Gameplay:as i stated earlyer the controls are kinda unorthadoxFun:10/10 through the roof!!!"
5,He's not far from the Kingdom,"Davies provides some answers to questions that have eluded the first two thousand years of Christianity. While Jesus spoke more about spirit and the Kingdom of God than anything else, traditional Christianity hardly addresses them. We have little chance of understanding Jesus without looking at these phenomena. I do tend to differ with Davies when he states that Jesus was not a teacher. I see no reason why he couldn't teach both verbally and experientially. I would recommend this book to any serious student of the real Jesus, and I am disappointed it is not more widely available. The Parables of Jesus by Richard Q. Ford is a good companion to this book. Ford, like Davies, makes the reader look at the parables in whole new ways."
5,Works as described,I was very pleased with this product it works as described. H have about four or five different boxes of wraps and ziplock bags in this rack.
3,good product - non-responsive company,sturdy product that does what is should. i have no complaints about product. but don't order from The Storage Store. find another company to order from. i was over charged on shipping and they would not respond to me. they charged me for out of stock items!! multiple emails went unanswered and NO ONE EVER picks up their business phone! should have done a charge-back but didn't think of it until it was too late.
2,Spot weld came apart after it was hung.,"A spot weld released after it was hung and I had placed my boxes of wraps in it. Cheaply made. I have had these in the distant pass and had no problems with them. Now they must have changed the manufacturer or the manufacturing process and they are not well made. Won't order any more, even though I need them."
2,Keeps falling down,"I attached this to my pantry door with the included screws. I followed the directions. It hung nicely. For a while it worked like it was supposed to. Then one day it just dropped off the door. I found that I could put it back by compressing the sides a little to put the screw brackets under the screw heads again. I tried tightening the screws but the metal bars and the screw heads are flush; they won't go any further. I stripped a screw trying to get it to go in further. Unfortunately the screws won't hold the rack on if I put more than 3 full rolls of any kind of wrapping in there. It's too short to put more than 3 regular-sized rolls in. I use it for one regular roll of wrapping, one small one and one box of sandwich bags. Inevitably someone will bump it though and everything falls out. I wouldn't suggest this item. If they made the screw brackets into screw holes instead this would work better."
2,Too small!,Easy to assemble with good hardware but overall it was to small. I was only able to fit 3 storage boxes in the rack. The back of my kitchen cabinet door easily would have fit a larger rack. Unfortunately I have not been able to locate one in the size I need.
4,Even holds my big box of plastic wrap,"It seemed silly to do so much research for a wrap rack, but I didn't see any reason to spend money on something that wasn't going to do the job, especially since our current solution was working (we had the rolls stuffed in a kitchen drawer, but needed the space). I buy the enormous box of Stretch Tite plastic wrap from Costco, and I was genuinely concerned that the box wouldn't fit in the rack, especially since some people were complaining about size. I did my measurements, compared them to the item, and clicked Submit Order with some nagging doubts. And yet the doubts were unfounded. This rack held not only my enormous box of Stretch Tite (about 3"" x 3""), but also my foil, parchment paper, wax paper, and a box of snack bags.The only reason it loses a star is because the screws seem to offer only a tenuous hold on the rack and I'm afraid it will fall off. (Again. Allow me to also recommend wall anchors if you're putting it in a pantry and not on a door.)"
1,Not The Original Versions Of The Hits: Save Your Money!,"Unfortunately, the Chubby Checker original catalog (along with those of ? & Mysterians; The Tymes; Bobby Rydel and other Cameo/Parkway artists) are all out of print and in the vaults of ABKCO. Don't count on seeing the originals in print at anytime during our lifetime. Save your hard earned dollars and don't purchase this disc!"
3,Fooled at first.,"I purchased this product earlier this year. Initially, I was pleased with the craftmanship and overall product.About the third wearing, I noticed the lapis had become uneven (one side had sunk deeper into the setting) leaving the surrounding metal pertruding around nothing. By the end of the day the entire stone had settled deeper into the mount resulting in a ridge of metal above the now-disappearing stone.At first, I thought maybe I had bumped the stone and loosened it. Looking back, I am certain that wasn't the case. To correct the problem, I took the ring to a silversmith who evenly pushed the metal ridge down, around the stone. The appearance isn't the same.For a ring this size, and a stone this large, it is an almost weightless piece of jewelry. My other sterling pieces are much heavier than this piece. Reminds me of a tin ring I used to get from a penny machine at the bus station."
4,Fun... for a while,"Building your first zoo is a complete blast, learning the ins and outs of the game. In your second game you build it bigger, with more knowledge of what exactly you're doing. In a third game you can experiment with a different terrain or climate and different animals.Unfortunately once you have played a few games DS Zoo Tycoon starts getting boring, fast. With nothing to do but maintain fences and sell animals why bother? It's great while it lasts but it doesn't offer new challenges for long enough.Only one game can be stored at a time, to play and save a new game the old game must erased, so sharing a game isn't reasonable. However, if you have several kids, as a ""hand-me-down"" this game can keep several children (and adults!) entertained."
5,Same as the PC version,"Zoo Tycoon for the DS, as far as I can tell, is the same as Zoo Tycoon on PC. I only wish that they would have added the expansion packs to it as well. But it is a fun game to play non the less. Zoo Tycoon is a great addition to anyone who has the DS, and it is so cheap compared to the other game prices. I recommend it to anyone who loves playing Tycoon games."
1,Very Disappointed in Game,"I love Zoo Tycoon for PC and was excited to get this game for DS.I was so disappointed with it and wished I could return it!The graphics are terrible, the controls are difficult to use.I wish I had read some of these reviews before I bought it or I would not have gotten it, I thought it was like the PC version. Now I want to sell it and get the Zoo Tycoon 2 Complete Collection for my PC. Anyone want to buy it?????"
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THE GAME,I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE YOU ASK FOR IT..I ORDERED THIS GAME FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS 8TH BIRTHDAY AND SHE NEVER RECEIVED IT WHEN I NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THEY SAID THE UPS GUY GAVE IT TO A MAN AT THE HOUSE AND IT WAS NO LONGER THEIR PROBLEM..I PAID EXTRA TO HAVE IT DELIVERED IN TIME FOR HER BIRTHDAY SO HOW I RATE THIS COMPANY IS AWFUL AND I WILL NVER ORDER ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM THEM AGIAN..THANK YOU PHYLLIS FEELEMYER
4,Be Afraid of What Owns You,"This little film leaves behind a huge impact. It is a tale of addiction and failure that will make you think.The ever interesting Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a stuffy bank loan manager who succumbs to the addiction of gambling. He spends weekends in casinos, hides his problem from co-workers and his girlfriend and suffers at the hands of his own actions. Hoffman is absolutely great in this role! Minnie Driver plays Hoffman's enabling and stupid girlfriend who believes in the lies more than what is before her eyes. Driver looses her savings and her life along with Hoffman in the spiral of gambling addiction and despair.This is one of those films that seems absolutely uninteresting but is deeply embedded with messages for us all. Gambling isn't the only addiction capable of destroying a beautiful and successful life so the mistakes seen in this film can certainly apply elsewhere. Mahoney is simply whatever owns you.....beware!"
1,don't. Just don't.,"I don't understand the critics. This movie SUCKED. The whole time I was watching, I just wanted to leave. Phillip Seymore Hoffman was such a drag! It was like watching a train wreck... you sat there thinking ""This guy can't really be THIS stupid, can he?"" and he'd prove you wrong, over and over again. What a tragedy. Minnie Driver looked awful. You wont' even recognize her. Skip this flick, it's so not worth it... and the critics who saw it and praised it? We must have seen two different flicks, because the one I saw sucked bawlz."
2,Predictable,"Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor. Dan Mahowny stole from the rich and gave to the bookie. I suppose we all can get soppy about a fat fuzz ball loser that can't stop gambling with his bank's money. The film is non-stop losing all day - all the time. No psychosis is more devastating than suicide by chance. The fellow gives it away in a perpetual state of orgiastic losses. He doesn't necessarily hurt the rich woman he is pilfering, but he does ruin his career and love life.I wouldn't get real excited about this film. There is no character, including Philip Seymour Hoffman you really care about. It's not a comedy and certainly no drama. We know what's going to happen."
4,Fun,Great game. Simple to manipulate and it makes you feel like you are God. Great too if you like this age in history.
2,Just a cheqp Starcraft imitation,This is just like Starcraft except it's not nearly as good....if you like Starcraft this is a big dissapointment compared to it.
5,More fun than a barrel of monkeys,"You can't lose by buying this game. I played the original for a couple of years and loved it. I couldn't wait until AOK was released, and when it was, it was well worth the wait. There's no end to the posibilities and different combinations you can use and play in AOK. I just can't wait until the expansion...."
4,Great Historical strategy game,For any of you history buffs out there this is the game for you. Not only is the the gameplay easy to follow and understand the visuals and sounds are great. The campaign modes are actually fun to play! Whats up with that? The game is real easy to pick up and the many different difficulty settings alows you to get better slowly not get frustrated and bite you mouse in half.
4,Great Strategy,"Great Storyline, Great Visuals, Great gameplay. The AI is fairly smart and pretty ruthless. The expansion pack is good too, but the units of the new and the old sometimes don't mesh very well- Mounted Conquistadors with Guns can generally slaughter basic tribal archers."
4,Challenging and Time Taking,"This is a middle age war addicts heaven. 4 ages, many buildings and countless units. The campaigns are very hard. I bought the game personaly for the skirmish options. This game is timetaking and hard and should only be used by people who like strategy games at least mediocre or more. Definetly not for part time strategy users."
4,Addictive Fun,"The only other real-time strategy game I'd tried was Close Combat: A Bridge Too Far. I really enjoyed that one, and this one's almost as good. I have to say I really enjoy the early parts of the game the most, when you're making really tough decisions about division of labor. Later in the game, you're basically just building as big an army as possible (usually several times)."
4,My 2nd favorite RTS Game,"When i first played Age of empires i knew the 2nd one would be a hell of alot better than the first. It was so much better. The resolution was better, the castle age and imperial age are an excellent add on.(The dark age and fudel are just like the ones in age of empires 1.) The new weapons, buildings, castles are my favorite. This game has no end to the limits. Multiplayer is so much fun except when there is lag. This game deserves to be honored with 4 stars because of its authentic gameplay."
3,Age of Empires,"The game was sent on time and with all the included pamplets. However, the graphics could be a bit better."
2,Out of Date Information,"I agree with the other comments that Ms. Loring is an obviously caring mom who is writing from experience and with compassion, but I find the information in the book very dated.The book does not mention the insulin pump, which many kids now use, and has been a wonderful alternative to shots for many people with Diabetes. Also, the philopsophy that kids with Diabetes are ""forbidden"" to ever have sugar is extremely dated. Children and adults with Type 1 Diabetes can certainly enjoy the occasional treat (birthday parties, etc), with prior planning, and careful monitoring. If you work with your healthcare provider closely, children with Type 1 Diabetes no longer have to be the ""odd kids out"".For more current information, check out Understanding Diabetes, published by the Children's Diabetes Foundation. While it doesn't have the ""Mom Who Has Been There"" angle, it does have a ton of very helpful and easily searchable information."
3,"o,k, if you are a collector but not really worth it.","o,k, if you are a collector but not really worth it.a so-so animated version of alice in wonderland that does not seem to follow the usual alice movie and seems a little out of order (i was not aware that alice ate any tarts). though it still does do ok with what it has. the sound is so so and sometimes needs to be relistened to to hear whjat was said. the is NO captioning / subtitle or other language.a quiz on the disc gives a win prize link ( digitalversatiledisc.com/youwin ) which is no longer good (domain is up for purchase). searching web gives no results what the ""prize"" was. the dvd says that there were 60 titles on the digitalversatiledisc.com website to find out what there are. the copyright for ""digitalversatiledisc.com"" is 1999."
5,Houston Jones Has Heart and Soul,"After hearing this cd and their newer one this year, and seeing them live several times, I have come to realize that Houston Jones offers not only unique, obscure and original tunes, but they deliver these tunes with deep, rich guitar picking, bass thumping and percussion playing that comes from their many years of loving music and loving to play for their fans. They not only provide music from a studio for your listening pleasure, but their very life experiences are portrayed in the emotion with which these extremely talented musicians bring you these songs of comfort. Don't leave home without this cd!"
1,the name itself is bullsh^t,This sucks more a^s then a sewer. But what makes me made This has Death Metal in the name. Hey go ahead and make your punk rock trash but dont put Death Metal in the name. Death Metal is to good for this music and the dumb f^cks that buy it.
5,Love,"This is my least favorite eagles record but its very good nonetheless, track 2 has a very cool riff and this guys seem to really enjoy playing together and it shows.... Buy now!"
5,The missing piece meets the big O,"this book, while appearing to be childish in nature, brings sane comfort to adult individuals who have begun to question their existance because of a serious event in their lives. I have read and re-read this book in the past and I give a copy away to distressted individuals.Becareful when ordering there are simialar titles which have to do with orgasm and that is not this area of exploration!JH"
4,Fairly Good Representation,"I've seen John twice - once in a club in early 2002 and second at a shed at the beginning of the tour this CD was taken from. John himself has said that the concept of this project was to not cobble together a ""best-of"" live album, but rather capture a single show, mistakes and all, out of 300 he did over the last year-and-a-half to capture what a typical show would be like (hence the title). As far as that goes, this is pretty successful. A bit of that end of tour tired-ness creeps into his vocals, and the mix does bury his vocals in the midst of what seems to be a continuous scream (it's not nearly as bad as many have stated, although the DVD is an improvement, plus it contains some additional John-isms). It is worth checking out for the unreleased songs, which are three of my favorites, ""Covered In Rain,"" ""Something's Missing,"" and ""Man On The Side."" If you want an idea of what a typical night with John would be like now, this is it. I miss the club days, though."
5,A Bargain at Twice the Price,I bought the Any Given Thursday DVD and fell so in love with the live versions of old favorites and previously unreleased songs that I had to get the CD too. I can't get enough of it. There is a great new intro to 3x5. There are also some awesome guitar solos that we miss out on in non-live recordings. This 2-cd set is a must have. It's the next best thing to being there.
4,John Mayer can play,"I was flipping around the tube yesterday and came across John Mayer playing on ""Austin City Limits"". He was stumming his acoustic and singing nice pop songs. It was a good alternative to the American Music Awards. Then I remembered seeing Stevie Ray Vaughan on this show on 2 occasions. John seemed out of place on this show. Then I flipped back to the AMA's to check out Hilary Duff. That was nice too. Then I went back to Austin City Limits and there was John Mayer with an electric guitar playing a blues song and really tearing it up. Next thing you know he is trading licks with Buddy Guy. If that wasn't enough minutes later he is playing a tune with Stevie Ray's old band Double Trouble. He was playing like Stevie Ray. John has even better chops. It was great!!!"
1,Well Lenny is a good song,Only for John mayer attempting to play/sing it. A teensager with a sore throat.
1,Don't buy this CD!,"This CD is the worst thing you will ever hear. This shouldn't even deserve 1 star, it's that bad. it's a big waste of your money. His voice sounds constipated and it drove me insane. i would seriously rather listen to math lectures than this."
4,La Femme Nikita Rocks,I watched this show from the very first to bitter last. It was so enthralling you don't even realize the show was over.The soundtrack does a great job of capturing the essence of the show. I wish they had come out with more because i always want to find the songs in the episodes.This is a definate good buy!
4,Overall Mood of LFN Captured Beautifully on CD,"This cd is wonderful. There's a great mix of music on it, a nice balance of techno, rock, and slow ballads. In fact, I'm listening to my LFN soundtrack as I type this. When I got my new rockin' Aiwa stereo, complete with two smaller speakers and a subwoofer, the first thing I did was put in my LFN cd and it was awesome. My floor was quaking. You can listen to this music any time and it'll fit your mood. I highly recommend it to anyone, fan of the show or not. And, in my opinion, Mark Snow did a simply fantastic job on the main title...it's better than the X-Files theme. :-)"
3,Editoral Review is nonsense,"I haven't listened to this entire soundtrack. But I was compelled by the editorial review to write my own response. Something I have NEVER before done on Amazon. I am particularly enraged by the statement ""Unfortunately, most of the acts here are either has-beens or never-weres, ...""How you can say this, and continue in the rest of your post to TOTALLY ignore the fact that Enigma is on the album, and who, incidentally, is neither a ""never was"" or a ""has been"" is TOTALLY beyond me.Idiotic review IMO."
2,Charges but doesn't sync,"Length of cable is ok - about 2' - and I usually have my device nearby to my laptop when I am downloading music. Retracts and expands ok -- sometimes needs coaxing to fully retract on either side. I discovered that although the cable allows my next gen nano to charge, it does not allow it to sync -- so I cannot download my recent purchases. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,You get what you pay for...,It won't work at all. Not on any computer in the house. I'd be upset if I didn't pay a buck.
3,Retractable USB cable,"For the price it is not bad, but the cord is starting to show through the plasic casing and I have only had it a little over a month. I still works, however."
2,Not as shown. Different brand!!!,"I have ordered and used this cable before and really liked it over other retractables that I had. Actually, this was the only cable that worked ans looked good having very slim 30- pin Apple connector. That's the reason I ordered 2 more of them... However, the items arrived are not the ones I ordered - they are the BLACK VERSION OF THE CHEAP WHITE CABLE YOU CAN BUY FOR $0.99 and they will last for few months only. Disappointed, as I read the reviews from others complaining about the same thing. Well, I am not going to return them as that will probably cost more to do so than to keep them. BUT BEWARE - THIS IS NOT THE ITEM YOU SEE ON THE PICTURE ! Just a black version of the widely available low-quality white retractable selling for $0.99 at Amazon."
5,"Great Book, the best I've ever seen!","no words can describe the richness and clarity of this book.the description of Maxwell's distribution, Gibbs formalism,etc...all with marvelous clarity and rigour. Everyone who wants to learn statistical Mechanics (under and graduates) MUST read this book."
2,Wasn't this a different name?,"This movie is old and it shows. It was entertaining, like watching a train wreck; I actually watched the whole of it. It's not based on reality even though astral projection does exist. I think it would have been better if it would have been based on reality more. It's something to watch when you're bored, and it was fun to see Stephanie Powers before Hart to Hart."
2,"really bad, but perhaps not irretrievable","This is another one of those 70s TV films with astral projection, murder, invisibility, whatever, with a nut case chasing a fetching blond. The characters are insipid and 2-dimensional, the story is plodding, but I did pay attention occasionally, which is more than I can say for others of the genre. Bad guy with special powers, smart cop, climax, etc.Recommended only if you can get it for free. I am amazed this is offered for sale."
3,Dora's Book of Manners,It is... OK. We really like Dora these days but this book is a bit to wordy to really get the message across.
5,Great Video,This video was exactly what I wanted. I remember watching these bible stories as a child and it helped me understand the written word the Bible.
2,New Amsterdam Pioneer,"The author has an interesting voice, and some of the scenes, like the drowning room, are quite striking. Mostly the book is sensory rather than descriptive in that the author creates an emotional state for the reader rather than conveys information. For example, I understood the interior world of the main character, but I had a hard time picturing her surroundings. It's also challenging because the ""story"" is not linear or very satisfying in the end. I imagine The Drowning Room would be better in one sitting, rather than over a few months like I read it. Overall, I was disappointed because I hoped to learn more about life in New Amsterdam, but I imagine this would be a refreshing read for the right reader."
5,Good for Origami paper,"We were looking for origami paper to use for African animals. We were not sure of the weight and size when we found it on the Amazon website. So we decided to take a risk and ordered it anyway. We were very pleased with it even though we had to cut it down to a square shape, and it made a bigger animal. And it didn't tear. The animal turned out beautiful and we got many compliments."
3,"Okay, but wish a little more time was spent packaging this","I bought these to use for photography, it will work fine for what I want, and I'll likely purchase at least one more to make sure because of the good price, but the edges of the paper were damaged from how it was packaged. It was shipped in a small box just big enough. I'll update after purchasing the second roll."
5,"good quality, timely shipping, multi-purpose ""pot + heat""","bought this to use with king crab legs brought back from alaska. The inner basket allowed removal of the crab legs without having to fish them out. it assembled easily, all parts were included, stand is solid. this is a good fryer, even though I do not use it for frying. suitable for any outdoor seafood boil use as well as frying. nice product."
4,Awesome! Great Deal!,"We have been very pleased with this product and have used it several times with great success. No problems assembling. Some discoloration at first but that was gone after a second boil. It does not seem as heavy duty as some others (maybe the aluminum vs steel) but works great and was a bargain for all the stuff you get. Make sure you turn the gas up all the way otherwise it will take forever to boil. We have used it for low country boils, and used the smaller fryer for making tempura and fried fish. Awesome. Have not tried to fry a turkey yet but I am sure it wouldn't be a problem. My brother-in-law got one as well and he loves his too! It's a great addition for fun outdoor cooking and for large groups!"
3,Good for Cyberpunk and Space Opera...but not both,"Dataware is one of those supplements that isn't made for good reading, it's made for making your game better. A bit dry, but chocked full of wonderful information for tech-oriented heroes.The actual dataware portion of the book is splendid, if you are playing a PL6/Cyberpunk campaign, filled with oodles of new software and devices that just screams ""Gibson"", but I have found these rules difficult to integrate into a PL7 or PL8 campaign.On the other hand, the robots section of the supplement did wonders for my Star*Drive campaign. With Episode One just hot off the presses in town, my players really wanted to go bashing droids right and left. This supplement really pulled through in that respect. I was able to design several droids to throw at my players in just an hour or so.Check it out, it'll add a lot of new tech to your campaign."
5,Perfect for camping,Used this to waterproof my car top carrier purchased for camping. Worked great and kept everything dry as advertised. Excellent product.
2,I Agree With Why Do I Bother,"Expecting the great Calder saga that came alive in her first three books, it is so disappointing to see the way Janet Dailey is now writing. I bought her first book over 25 years ago when it was released. This Calder edition has another beloved character killed and not even mentioning some of the family. It's hard to get a close feeling to the new characters because we miss the old ones too much!!!"
2,"Is the movie Deepstar Six or Deepstar ""2"" which it is","I was not so impressed with the quality of the movie. The movie's graphics and outdated props where definitive in the movie. The plot is good but they did not show it properly in the movie. Its a low budget movie which it showes. Its an OK movie deserving ""2"" stars of Deepstar ""2"" related to stars. I would rent the movie and not own it since its not such a good one. Its a D- movie."
1,"Poor quality, bad design","First. the beans have to fall around a 'guide' in the hopper that can cause the beans to stop falling into the grinder altogether. Second, the catch-bin doesn't fit the main housing very well. Third, the electronics are poor. I encountered a failed power connection and it shipped back for repair. Received repaired after two weeks only to have a similar electronic failure a couple weeks later. Skip this product and buy a Barazta. The Baratza is far superior - 5 starts for the Baratza Maestro Plus."
1,A Disappointment,"I second what others have said: this product doesn't always work, and when it does, it plays out of only one channel. I bought two (from a local source), thinking that the malfunction might have been a fluke. No such luck. It's just a bad product."
3,WOW and 5 STARS for durability,"I bought this adapter last week from a local retailer. After reading the reviews I was ready to take it back. I did a test run of it today and the sound is pretty good, better than the cheaper one I had before. The WOW and extra stars is for the durability of the charger. It fell out of the car and got run over. With the plastic casing in pieces I plugged it in on a whim and low and behold it still worked. It is now held together by electrical tape and duct tape but I am pretty pleased with everything overall."
1,Extremely poor sound quality,"I purchased this cassette adapter in order to listen to music from my ipod in my car. I have to turn the volume on the ipod up all the way, and the volume on the stereo up higher than I usually do, to get any sound. Even then, the sound will suddenly go out for no reason. This is junk. At least the car charger is usable, and the only reason I won't complain about not being able to rate this zero stars."
1,JUNK!,We used this thing TWICE and just went to use it again today and it had a hole in the bottom of the pot! JUNK JUNK JUNK!
5,Perfect starter kit.,Awesome starter kit. It comes with so many of the accessories that other companies charge extra for. It was pretty easy to assemble and it worked great.
3,Terrible Packaging,"Haven't actually tried out the item yet, but out of the box, the pot came with a bunch of dents already, either from bad packaging or lack of care."
1,BAD,"god, this HAS to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my whole life. highly stupid. drew barrymore and lucy liu are some of my favorite actresses, but cameron diaz gets all the screen time. she's a horrible actress and she continues to do idiotic movies. good job cameron.this movie had almost no plot, and it wasn't very carried and supported throughout the movie. the dialogue was boring and dull."
2,Demi Moore almost spoils it ...,"... but it's still a pretty good film. More of the same, but less so, although I think this relies on too much CGI to show Demi Moore in a bikini. Still entertaining.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Full of cameo's,"This movie should have been called ""Charlie's Angels: Full of cameo's"". I actually spent more time trying to see if I could count the number of cameo's then paying attention to the film itself. The movie was way over the top. There were just too many things in the second film that seemed unbelievable, but maybe that was the point. It was a point I missed. Crispin Glover as the Thin Man in the second film. I did not understand why his character was in this film. Was I too believe that the angels could be 1. Flung through a window at high speed, 2. fall down some stairs at high speed. 3. pull a piece of glass out of her stomach fight the bad chick, then change and appear at a Hollywood screening unscathed? Some of the fighting scenes were cool, but the movie IMHO was not as good as the first one. Someone compared this movie to face off. I'm sorry the two movies do not even compare!!! Face Off is a much better film."
1,One big fragmented music video,This has got to be the worst movie ever made (next to Gigli). It has absolutely no plot and every other scene has the women dancing to some stupid song or an action sequence with music blaring.I cant believe I even spent my money on a matinee on this garbage. If you are under the age of 20 this movie will appeal to you because your brains are still trying to develop and you have no concept of what's right and wrong. This movie is definitely wrong and a waste of time and money.
1,Don't waste your time,The first movie was pretty good. It did not take itself too seriously and was funny. This one just is just plain awful. They went overboard and the end result was that it was totally lame and mind numbing.
2,"Hey, this isn't art. Two stars is a gift.","Hot girls, lots of cleavage, good pop music, expensive toys, high production values & special effects. But most of all 4 chicks, all 10's on the babe meter. Make sure they wear just enough clothes so the 12 year old boys can get in the theater. Hey it's a summer movie. Now its on dvd. Plot? What's that? Bernie Mac has a few good lines. That's it."
5,"""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle""","Don't go in expecting much because you wont et a lot out of it.The 1st movie was goofy colorful and full of fluff! This is not as goofy not as colorful and no fluff, but is that a bad thing no! It brings new flavors to the film like edgeiness, toughness. There are some funny jokes and the action is awesome! Cameron Diaz is really funny! Drew Barrymore brings depth to the picture and Lucy Liu is crazy! Watch for a funny cameo by John Cleese as Alex's Father.Overall this is a summer popcorn filck! Like ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" leave you brain at home and you'll enjoy it, thats what I did and really enjoyed this. Its a fun movie with a new spin on Charlie's Angels!See It!Other good summer sequels:""2 Fast 2 Furious""""X2""""The Matrix Reloaded""Other good summer movies:""Finding Nemo""""The In-Laws""""The Italian Job""""The Lizzie McGuire Movie""""Alex & Emma"""
1,Please?,"This movie isn't even worth seeing hot chicks running around. It has no point, no story, the acting is worse than a soap opera's acting, and the dialogue is so bad Ed Wood Jr. couldn't even of dreamed of writing it.Maybe Roger Ebert was a little quick in naming The Brown Bunny as the worst movie ever?"
1,Unbelievably BAD,"I have to agree with the other negative reviewers here, this was absolutely, without a doubt, the WORST movie I have ever seen and I LOVE these woman. But to be completely honest I would MUCH rather just stare at a picture of them than watch this movie, that would be FAR more entertaining. Run away, run away as fast as you can."
3,Full Tilt Boogie,"Rude and Crude, Loud and Crass on the outside but gooey as a Marshmallow on the inside, ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" comes screeching onto a million screens this weekend. And Drew Barrymore, Lisa Lui and Cameron Diaz seem to be having loads of fun karate chopping a couple dozen men and one woman: the commandingly sexy Demi Moore, a former Angel gone bad.The Women are beautiful as are the men, the action is feverish and Bernie Mac as the new Bosley is a hoot. And it all adds up to a fun, though empty-headed time."
1,Slitting My Own Throat Would Be More Fun,"I tried very hard to get into Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but it's so bad I think slitting my own throat would have been more fun. I ended up just channel surfing the night away. I can't believe crap such as this gets made year after year, guess that's what happens when you replace studio heads with clueless MBA clones that can't make a decision without consulting the day's horoscopes. Even more upsetting are ""directors"" like McG who kept getting gigs without showing an ounce of ability to tell a story, or direct for that matter. I think I can do better working from my trash bin of bad ideas than McG can on his best days, and I only have half a brain!"
2,Hot Chicks! Bad Flick!,This film was one of the stinkers of 2003. Not a cereberal film at all but I wasn't expecting it to be. The leading ladies were of course the main attraction. Cameron Diaz is great for eye candy in this film. The Sweetest Thing wasn't exactly Cocteau but I enjoyed it even though it wasn't that good. It would've been hilarious if Sean Young was the villianess instead of Demi Moore. The plot didn't exist and Bernie Mac was annoying.
3,"Good, But Doesn't Compare With First","Like many other sequels, it was good, but just not quite as entertaining as the first. Jam packed with cameos... the second installment brings you loads of action. I didn't think the story line was that great, just ok... and some of the jokes I though to be cheesy, some hesterically funny. The acting was good, and it was a great come-back role for Demi Moore. I say, if you liked the first, go out and buy it!"
2,The book is weak and doesn't always make sense,"As was described in an earlier review, the transformation of bandit Marcus Cole into Statesman was not adequately explained. I also want to know why Stephan Riechter, who becomes Lord Recluse, grows into a monster with metal-tipped spider legs on his back. This is not explained well either. There is also a scene where a non-super-powered reporter, who has been taking some martial arts classes, karate chops a large steel pipe or beam and bends it in two with her bare hands.Also, the superheroes that come to aid Statesman pretty much come out of nowhere. Elementar seems extremely powerful and it's surprising that he did not do anything with his powers until Statesman came along.I could go on if I felt like refering back to the book, but I don't. It's just not a very polished story in my humble opinion. I hope the author's own original works are better than this."
5,"A ""New"" Approach to Vocabulary Building","When you come across a Vocabulary Building books, more often than not, the sentences for ""new"" words are made up (factitious)for illustrations on demand. This limits the application of the new learnt knowledge in day to day life. This book takes the learning to a whole new level. The sentences are taken from newspapers, novels etc. This helps put the ""new"" words in context, thus making the word alive and linger long after you have studied it.Though the book is atleast four decades old, but defintely worth its place in library."
5,Robert is a true musician in every sense.,"Robert is an outstanding musical talent who has the ability to balance superior lyrical content with the perfect composition. In addition, his unique sense of humor make this an enjoyable cd on many levels. Personal favorites: Jambalaya; Like A Glove; Yo Yo Pa; Famous Jane; The Rent; Driven In Me; The Way back Home; Blew 'Em Away."
3,Before you order this!,"Make sure you include at least one label tape casette with your order! I wrongly assumed that it would come with one and now have to pay for shipping again to get the tape. Also, be sure you have 6 batteries."
5,Not your old DYMO,WOW We are impressed. I bought this before Christmas to help my daughter (9 years old) improve her organizational skills and now the entire family uses it. My husband and I each take it to work and the kids use it for numerous school-related things. My husband's employer and mine have each made purchases of this item since seeing how wonderful it is and easy to use. We may have to buy three more so we can all have our own. Tremendous improvement over the old DYMOs!
2,Outdated - 10 MBps,"I've had this unit in the garage the past year and dug it out to increase my access points only to discover that it slowed my network down from 100 MBps to 10 MBps. I'm not going to use it and checking eBay I can't even find anyone able to sell it for $20, let alone $400."
4,Working Motherboard,"The application that I am using this on is not your standard server type of application. I needed to replace the motherboard on an Intellex Ultra (commercial dvr for a camera system).The motherboard powered up and started, but there were incompatibility issues with my system. This board had a Google Mini bios on it and it did not like my configuration. I swapped bios chips from the bad motherboard and it loaded fine.The reason for the 4 stars is because of the bios. I think that in most circumstances that the board would work fine, but is the Google Mini bios a factory bios or something the seller requested extra?Either way the board worked and I am happy I saved a lot of money."
1,Staind the Videos for kiddies,Videos are censored. I would not have bought this had I known. If you're going to release music videos they should be unedited and explicit version of the song!!
5,"Excellent, practical guide to profession fashion photography","Among all the books I have seen on photography, this book takes a cake for being the best for professional photographers as well as serious students of fashion photography. The book offers creative range of all sections of personal fashions for all those who want to establish themselves professionally in fashion field. The book teaches technics behind some of the best fashion shots, capturing the spirit behind such photographs through the lense. Things that make the fashion photographer unique, the combination of beauty and brains. The book takes you through scene setting and lighting with easy to follow graphics, that allows reader to understand the sensitivity required to capture in one shot what the photographer want others to see. The format and the paper quality bring out the best of all the shots to make this book a collectors item for serious photographers and avid book lovers alike."
1,Little to hold my interest,"I had a tremendously difficult time sitting through this movie. There is nothing good I can say about it. It is poorly written, directed and forced upon the unsuspecting audience before you know what hits you.The plot involves nine friends who get together at a cabin in the woods, ""Big Chill"" style but minus the style. Then we must endure cheesy dialoge while the movie plods along, unfolding new and uninteresting facts about each relationship as if we cared enough to want to know. The more I learned the less I cared.It was such a let down that I feel writing this review will somehow make my time spent worthwhile by saving someone else the misery.Carol"
1,Simply doesn't work,"Supplied software would only download contacts, except it could never connect to my phone with included cable. No documentation, no directions for resolving problems or finding software to download pictures. Total waste of money and very misleading. Amazon should reconsider this ""partner""."
1,Not good fot the AG-DV20,I own an AG-DVC20 and it doesn't fit. I tried to get a refund from the seller but no response so far. Please be careful with the product's description and specification.
2,Don't believe the hype...,"Many other reviewers seem to believe this is a great psyche album. It isn't; it's mediocre at best. Hundreds of drugged-out bands played this brand of acid rock, and most of the ones we remember did it much better. Nothing about this album sticks out of the mold defined, if not started by the Dead and J Airplane. If you're looking for something groovy (though not necessarily related) from this time period, I suggest Buffalo Springfield's albums and/or Frank Zappa's We're Only In It For The Money."
4,beyond thunderdome,love all mad max great films can watch them over and over and over and over and two more words lol
3,its good...kinda,"its good,but they shouldnt have tried to make it like peter pan or whatever. It felt kiddish. but it was still good over all."
5,"The sequel is great, too.","This is a really good intro to the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. Clear, simple, and biblically solid.But I like the sequel even better because it not only gives you the short course on each book in the Bible, it helps you put it to practice.The first book--How to Get into the Bible--is history. The second book--How to Get the Bible into My Life--is history applied to our lives today.Both are helpful, well-written, and insightful."
4,Another gem from Hollywood's classic era,"This movie engaged me from the beginning, casting its line right to my easy chair and reeling me into its all too believable world of human triumph and tragedy. It is an example of what can happen when strong acting, strong writing and strong direction are brought together by people who DO NOT aim for the lowest common denominator, but rather, for the sophisticated audience who reacts warmly only to quality performance and credible story line. I also appreciated the structure and pacing, where subplots are introduced and then intertwined, and just the right time is taken to develop characters and story before changing the focus, so I could follow it.See this for an evening of real entertainment. The only problem is, it will spoil you for any of the dumbed-down crapola that Hollywood has released in recent years."
2,not right for my Toyota Sienna Van,"This looked good on the site but for a van, it did not fit well enough to travel. There were 6 adults going on a two week driving trip and we could not make the saddlebag fit well enough to feel safe with it on the back of my Toyota Sienna van. It also rubbed against the back (just trying to install it) and I will need to have the lift door buffed to bring it back to the original look.SUV's may be better for this piece of equipment."
5,we made it!,"more than 2800 miles, through all kinds of weather- getting the dog in and out of the back of our 08' chevy trailblazer was easy, all three kids had plenty of room, this was the perfect solution for a cross country trip!! we actually didnt use the license plate holder- we had it hiked up a bit higher so our plates were still visible, and we put the bag in the vehicle when we would stop for the night. the license plate holder is a great feature, the plate would be secure and visible with no concern if you did need to use it.i had two or three extra large space bags, two 32"" duffel bags, a carry on size duffel, and other odds and ends packed in this ""car backpack"" as my 7 year old named it, and we still had room in there tho i am not sure how much weight we shoved in there, it is tough and was probably carrying well over it's weight limit."
4,Serve the purpose,"I like the concept of the product. Served its purpose well. Installation, you have to patient. Took a while to figure it out and make a bunch of adjustments. Once it was fitted, good to fit not so heavy weight, bulky items for a 2010 Dodge Journey. Used it during a trip across northern Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan during the winter. Not water resistant at all.Enclosed items that you do not want to get wet into tubs or plastic. The tubs help give the bag support to stay up right. I placed pipe insulation foam padding between the bag and the vehicle so it would not ruin the paint on the vehicle.This summer treated the bag with a waterproofing sealant. I hope that will help with the water issue."
1,No keyboard learning here!,"My child is 3 and has good mouse skills, so I thought this product is the next logical step. Good thinking, bad choice. The software is all mouse driven. My child played for 2 hours and was not encouraged to use the keyboard even once. My child kept asking when it would be time to use the keyboard so I took it to the highest skill level only to be let down. My child fell in love with the keyboard instantly so I cannot return it now. I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake."
5,Loved this one.,Excellent story line. Edgy and intriguing. You do not have to have read the previous books in the series to enjoy these books.
3,Not as strong as the other FBI Thriller Series,"""The Edge"" is the fourth sequel in the FBI Thriller series and it is a puzzle that twists around a conspiracy of a mystery drug that has strong sexual side effects and has built greed and confusion among multiple characters.Welcome back Lacey Sherlock - Savich and her husband Dillon Savich. Everyone loves these two FBI agents. Of course, they are on their way to help out a friend, Ford ""Mac"" MacDougal investigate what really happened to his sister Jilly. Mac has had a weird premonition and he going to figure it all out.Throw in a new character DEA Laura, hot humid jungle, weird drug reactions that have adverse sexual side effects and you will have to work to unravel the puzzle.I truly enjoy the FBI Thriller series but have to be honest this one was lacking."
1,She insulted my intelligence,"Having read almost all of Catherine Coulter's historical romances, I can safely say that she's one of the best. However, she leaves much to be desired in the ways of modern ""suspense"". I've read all 4 books in this series. The only one I liked was The Maze. The Edge is BY FAR the worst. The first chapter really interested me, but it just went downhill from there. The characters are horrible--in all these books they barely know each other but fall in love at the drop of a hat. And they were so poorly developed; I just didn't care what happened to any of them. But even more painful is The Edge's storyline. It is so far-fetched! There are parts that just do not connect. It really seems to me that these 4 books were not of Coulter quality. Did she have deadlines to meet?"
2,disappointing,"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target, I couldn't wait to buy this book. Am I glad that I read the reviews and waited till it came out in soft cover. The book had a lot of potential and it grabbed my interest with the first chapter. It was unfortunate that I ended up forcing myself to finish the book. The story not only drags but the characters are not well developed at all. We know the same amount of information about Mac, Laura and the rest of the cast at the end of the book as we do at the begining the only insight we gain is their employment history. The first person perspective was alright but again sadly lacking, normally the reader is given an indepth view into a charater when this format is used, here it just annoying and shallow. I would definatly not take this book on a train, plane, or bus where it would be the only entertainment."
2,"Great story, poor writing","This is my first book by Coulter, and my last. Though the story was interesting enough for me to finish the book, and the research was really solid, the writing is childish. I found myself shouting at the book when characters delivered awkward, polysyllabic inanities during moments of high passion. And the ending, after a huge hysterical build-up, falls kinda flat. One star for plot and one star for research; deduct 3 stars for amateur-hour writing."
2,Difficult to maintain interest.,"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target I looked forward with great anticipation in reading The Edge. However, as I dislike first person narrative I had trouble keeping my mind on the storyline. I only read half the book. I hope the next book she writes is in a different format. If you dislike first person narrative don't purchase this book."
1,Written In First Person,"The inside cover sounded as good as her other RS; however it is written in first person, and for me, that was a stopper! By writting in the third person one gets the views of others that are involed in the story, from their thoughts, not just the one telling the story, as is done in the third person."
2,I thought I was the only one who hated it!,"The Maze, one of my favorite books in recent years, turned me on to Catherine Coulter--I anxiously awaited this new novel to discover the recent activities of Sherlock and Savich--too bad I had to read the rest of the book to find out. It was painful and incredibly disappointing--I'm praying her next novel is much, much better and that she takes her readers into consideration--the male point of view just doesn't cut it in first person for a romance novel--The Target worked with a male protagonist, but this one lost me by page 3. Please, oh, please Ms. Coulter, come back to us--where did you go?"
2,Disappointed,"I read as many of CC's books that I can get my hands on, and I was very disappointed in this one. The story was quite unbelievable and stupid at times."
5,it's helllla bomb!,"hey, guys! just wanted 2 say that the whole album is bomb! i've been listenin 2 Kai for a few years now- their music is helllla sweet n the dudes are mad chill! ""heart to heart""... ""count on my love""... ""goodbye in your eyes""... ""say you'll stay""! <3 ... can't wait 2 see you guys back out here! take care! much love from the east coast 2 the west 637, ginaboo... ()=)"
2,very bad,"Here's a list of facts about the game.1. very low polygon count.2. horrible driving.3. pedestrians run away from you when you go towards them, run into a wall (or eachother) and then fall down and die because of it.4. very bad voice acting and plot.5. trying to be GTA in every manner as far as driving, shooting, missions, perspective, item collection, but worse in all.6. trying to use bullet time from max payne, not so effective.7. some good spanish rap music."
4,Good early Como,"I think this DVD is good for what it is. I thought the quality of the performance clips (each of which is the whole song, not a snippet) was as good as one could expect from material that is 50+ years old. And it included several songs which I have never heard before and I have been listening to Perry's music since the 1950's.My complaint is calling these his best. While there were some of his well known songs included like Till the End of Time and Papa Loves Mambo there were many, many others that belonged in a best collection that were not there, like Prisoner of Love, You Alone, No Other Love, Wanted, Catch a Falling Star and more. And I think including the songs from Doll Face was inappropriate because I doubt if even many diehard Como fans have ever heard them.If it was not possible to get the rights to include the rest of his best songs I think they should have retitled the DVD. That said though I found it a pleasant walk back down memory lane."
1,horrid tripe,Como was GREAT but this DVD looks like it was taken from the worst quality clips in the qworld..almost like someone wants to soil Como's great image intentionally..if you are a fan wait for a truly authorized product to come out!
1,Perry Como Singing at his Best,Terrible.. this is not worth the money. It is grainy and ugly. What a waste!!
5,This book was absolutely amazing...,"This book is filled with numerous short stories, the themes of all speak to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the ""privilege"" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying..."
4,Hallmark Collectors set,"Great clean movies, Ilike being able to sit down with the family and not have to worry about cuss words or nudity."
1,Halmark 6 pack,I was very disappointed in this product. All the publisher did was add two stories to the preveous 4 pack. I annoyed me and left a bad taste in my mouth.
3,Great replacement for my Razr V3 except....,"The internet services don't work on Cingular's network. Also, when I called Motorola for support they didn't even know of the model, as it's not an American model. Phone calls work fine. SMS works. Can't delete any of the preconfigured web session entries, so I guess this one goes back. It's a shame. I'm not sure if this actually will work on Cingular's 3G network here, either."
1,BRITISH SNOOZER,"Maybe if I were British I could appreciate the style of John Gardner. He never ceases to completely bore me. I have read all the Ian Fleming's and though they are dated and quirky and sometimes corny I had a great time with them, so it's unfair to criticize the less dramatic British style of novel. But frankly I can't believe this franchise continued under Gardner. I made sure to give myself sufficient time between them, taking four years to read the first five novels. That's it. I quit. ""For Special Services"" is as close as I could get to be entertained, and ""Role of Honor"" the least enjoyable. After my struggle to get through 80 percent of ""Nobody Lives Forever"" I am selling off the other nine I own. Life is too short. For anyone agreeing with me I would absolutely recommend at least the first three Raymond Benson 007 books. Read them in order. Each one gets better. After a seven year absence I'm ready to start these again."
3,good value for a low price,I should have known you get what you pay for. A person really has to be steady in holding something over 10x50s. Hope to use them on a trip to Hilton Head in a few weeks. The jury is still out on this one. Amazon service is great and hope to use them again. Thanks
1,WAY TOO BIG,"WHEN WE RECEIVED THESE BINOCULARS I THOUGHT I WAS BACK IN THE 50'S. TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED SO MUCH, HOW COME THEY STILL MAKE THESE GIANT SIZE THINGS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE BIGGER THAN THE AVERAGE ONES, BUT THESE ARE HEAVY AND GIANT SIZE. I KEPT THEM BECAUSE I ALSO LIVE IN JAMAICA AND I WAS THERE WHEN THEY WERE DELIVERED. WHEN I GOT BACK IT WAS TO LATE TO SEND THEM BACK. I WILL HAVE TO NOW BUY SOME MORE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THEY ARE ALSO NOT AS CLEAR AS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. BUT AGAIN LOOK AT THE PRICE. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
1,Barska Zoom Binoculars,"You get what you pay for: Cheap plastic parts, especially internal retaining rings, etc. do not hold up at all: slippage when zooming causes internal parts to break. Life expectancy, about 2 hours. Don't bother with these."
3,"Good content, but now somewhat outdated and contradicting","This is a good book for grasping an understanding of the terminology and options for investing. I find this book, as with most I have read on investing, consistently contradicts itself - or does a poor job of explaining the reasons behind why you'd make once investing decision over another. For example, in one breath it will say, ""Option A is a good choice for investing"". In the next section of the chapter it will say ""Option A is not a very good choice for investing"".Also, much of the 529 (college savings) information is now outdated."
5,Headboard has got it,"Headboard has a great feel to it, with the two leads playing beatifully off of each other. I have heard most fo their old stuff, from Straight Edge Chick sXe to Tell Me How to The End Is Near, they almost always manage to come up with a new and original sound. From rock-style guitar and vocals to rap beats that are stunning to techno like sounding backgrounds in Brake On, Headboard is always good. They move from pumped to mellow, and have considerable skill at both levels. I loved this latest CD most of all, with Tell Me How remaining my favorite song of theirs. I hope they play in DC sometime soon."
5,"Reviva - Light Skin Peel, 1.5 oz cream","I bought this product for myself and now my whole family is using it! The peel does a great job of exfoliating dead skin cells and leaving skin refreshed and glowing while not irritating it. I use it 2-3 times a week and my skin looks like it is at least 10 years younger! This is a ""must have"" for your skin care regime and it is priced right and made with natural non irritating products."
5,Reviva Skin Peel,"I love this peel and have been using it for years. I love the soft, clean feeling it leaves on your face & the way it makes my skin look. Just be careful not to rinse down the drain, because it will turn into glue in your pipes. I always peel mine onto a cloth, then throw the peelings in the garbage can."
1,Eh..,"I bought this product some time ago, I don't hve it anymore but I do remember it breaking me out though wasn't too impressed with it"
4,It's not a Game!,"Hot CD! I don't have the first cd ( the documentary ) but I plan on getting it now! I can't even imagine how good it must be with Dre doing the beats. The beats on this cd are tight and the flow is incredible. definite west coast ridin' party music, with a hardcore gangsta feel. must have for any west coaster!"
2,Same old name calling,The production is too good for him to be on. The people giving this 5 stars must be people he know. I wish i could have just found the music only. This is not a west coast classic.
5,Classic west coast LP!!!,"The Game does his thing yet again, establishing himself one of hip-hop's few pre-eminent MC's with Weezy, Kweli, Nas & Lupe...he carries the West Coast on his shoulders all by himself...with NO dre, even tho I can't wait for Detox. Dre's influence can be felt all over this album, and to me - that's a phenomenal thing. How could you expect an LA MC, specifically one from Compton, to not have Dre's style infused throughout his entire personality? Dre infused his style into everyone who lives and breathes west coast hip-hop, and Game takes it to the next level. Move over calvin, jayceon came to play..."
4,Don't hate the game,"With the Game's second album he, as in the first ablum, carries his own wait. His lyrical ability has grown, while staying the same. The production is a great relationship with East and West. Moreover, the strengh's of the record are One Blood, Let's ride, Dr. Advocate, and Why you haten on the game. However, the game seems to be holding back and not allowing his strength to come forth. He mentions himself along the greats like Pac, Big, Jay, and Nas, but those guys could make a hit that crossed over into pop clubs. The Game has that same ability I can hear it in his words, but just like those greats it took their third albums to come out before that crossover happened."
2,Just more plastic,"It is just more plastic toys to be stepped on. I thought it would be a bit sturdier, too. The kids like it, but not their first choice in role plating toys."
4,Evocative,"Transcending the barrier between the Japanese and American minds requires direct experience that no amount of reading can supply. However, this novel of culture, manners and decay in the interwar years is poignant and enlightening. The obsession with class and manners is particularly sad in light of the immanent war and destruction of The Empire.Probably a ""girl"" book, but still.Read and learn."
5,Hard to fly.. yeah right!!,"This is the best Flight sim game I have had. I can fly about anywhere on it. If you want to be a pilot, this game is for you!!"
3,Confrontational and accusatory,"Silko has no shortage of opinions to share, mostly on how her people have been put down through the ages. She's not wrong -- Native Americans have indeed been done a great deal of dirt through the years -- but her style is accusatory and confrontational, not likely to win many converts to her cause. Read and enjoy for a point of view outside the mainstream, but expect to be offended by it if you were born white."
4,Yoga Journal's Yoga Basics : The Essential Beginner's Guide,"The word ""Essential"" says it all in terms of the usefulness of this book. This is a must have for the person that wants to put the right foot forward in understanding and developing a personal Yoga practice, or for the individual that hopes to gain a better historical understanding of this ancient practice. In a concise fashion the reader will acquire the tools to develop an individual practice. The reader will also find answers in identifying an instructor and style of Yoga that is right for them. Clear photographs and detailed instructions round out this most excellent and ""Essential"" resource."
3,Focused on high-limit hold'em (not no-limit),"This book is written with high-limit hold'em games in mind, and I was looking for a book on no-limit hold'em. Yes, you can adapt the strategies to no-limit games, but this book gives very specific advice on how to act on specific hands, so in that context, it doesn't necessarily cross-over well into no-limit.Hoenstly, after reading the first few chapters, I found myself flipping through the book as a found the concepts not that ""advanced"". Perhaps, this book is old enough that the concepts have been out there long enough that most seem relatively basic.I think next time I will try more macro conceptual books like ""Theory of Poker"" in order to get a more ""advanced"" perspective on things."
3,Some good material,"Skalansky's method is based on card groupings, and when and where to play them. The book is not a beginners guide to Hold'em, and so the authors focus on specific hands, and what to do in certain situations.This is not a gloss over, page through kind of book. Helpful tactics are discussed, but I think it needs to be dug into to really get the most out of it.I believe this book has made me a better hold'em player, but I have material from elsewhere as well that I think is just as good."
2,OK...but not great,"I have been playing Hold 'Em successfully for 10 years and finally decided to buy this book because I heard so much about it. It was not the best investment I've ever made.Sklansky and Malmuth are both very knowledgable about the game...odds, probabilities, etc. But they are not great writers (and they admit that in the beginning). The book is very boring...and not well written. Most of the info is common sense, but there a few pearls of wisdom.It is DEFINITELY not for a poker newbie. But if you have some time in at the tables and want something to read on the john, give it a shot."
3,This book is not for no-limit holdem!,"I don't know if other reviews touch on this, but this book is intended for limit holdem games. While many of the ideas can be applied to no limit games, the author continually discusses limit play. This is important since there is little in the book about pot odds and implied odds. And since the author assumes you are playing limit games, the discussion regarding these topics is limited to ""if you are raised on your right"" and so on. For people who want specifics about how much of a raise on your right should cause you to fold, this book is lacking.I will say, however, that the section on hand rankings has improved my play (in both limit and no limit games). But if you are looking for a specific no limit book, you might try something else."
2,Good book for people who are lucky .. for the rest of us it's not,"David clearly understands the game and is well verse in the probabilities and potential outcomes of different stages of a round of Texas Hold'Em. However his advice, and corresponding play on the few nationally broadcast events I've been him in, essentially boils down the ""hope that you get good cards before the ante eats you up""Alot of people can win when they get good cards, but the books I want to read are about pros that win time and again with or without good cards .. I'd recommend Doyle Brunson's ""Super System"" .. written almost 3 decades ago .. it has most insightful advice I've come across to win at Texas Hold'Em."
4,This is the one,The greatest Book on Hold'em. This is the book that will make you $. All of the others can get you slightly above break even...but thios one will push you squarely in the black
4,put your faucet within reach,"I needed to get my faucet away from the house and have space for attaching hoses. This simple solution did the trick. Because it is plastic and light weight, a tug on the hose can pull it out of the ground, but nothing is harmed. If I needed a more permanent solution, I would pay the higher price for a metal faucet that could be more permanently secured. But for my needs, this is sufficient."
1,don't bother,"Great Idea, crummy execution.The brass parts at the end of the hose were cheaply made and could be bent very easily. The stakes to place the hose were so short that to place them securely meant pushing the stake to ground level, making it impossible to connect w/o getting on your hands and knees and fighting with the grass to attempt the connection. Any pulling on your hose yanked the stake out of the ground.Convience? no, very poor quality parts, & a pain in the ...to use."
3,Faucet extender,"This is a great product for outdoor faucets that are blocked by bushes, etc. I wish the stake had been a little longer so that attaching your hose would be a little easier. The on/off valve works fine."
3,Not one of her Bests but still Good,"I am a Nora Roberts fan. I love her books she keeps me so captivated I usually can't put her book down. This one had way to many passages, to many people and to much going on at the same time. I do love the suspense and the story line but the problem is I didn't know sometimes who she was talking about. If you like a story line and a book that constantly moves and of course the evil person who wants it all at no expense than this is a good book for you. I still love Nora just this book is just not like her others."
2,Could definately put it down.,"Like most others, I have found Nora Roberts to write consistantly interesting and entertaining stories. Like some others, I have found this one lacking in many areas. I was able to take breaks without worrying about what would happen next. This will not stop me from picking up her next novel, but I hope this was a blip in the otherwise consistant creativity I have come to expect from Nora Roberts."
2,Too much of the same thing...,"I'll have to admit the book cover sounded interesting enough, but it seems NR gets into everything by threes, and it gets to be a bit much. I thought the women in this book were as goofy as all get-out, as well as an embarrassment to the female gender. And I never cared much for that. She had all the couples climbing into bed together too soon. The plot surrounding the Three Fates was a great idea, but the prose failed to follow through. I still think NR's first books were some of her best, and I still believe she's one of the greatest romance writers of all times. I'm just not big on this book. I've read much better with NR's name on the cover."
4,Entertaining enough,"I agree with many of the other reviewers here (e.g. the characters make it into bed with one another before the plot starts rolling, Cleo's character can be less pushy, dialogue can be confusing at times when all six characters are talking all at once, etc.), but I am still giving the book four stars, as opposed to three and under, because Three Fates was definitely a good read, if not a perfect one. The plot definitely takes some creative twists and turns, and Roberts has made an obvious move away from her usual only-revealing-the-bad-guy-until-the-end model, which actually enhances the plot and the flow of the story. The suspense is effectively interwoven with heartwarming romance, so even though the book does not show Roberts at her best, the entertainment value is still up there."
3,Enjoyed as light reading,"The book was given three stars because it was lighter in content than I had anticipated. Although it did have a mystery plot, it was too contrived to be considered a thriller. The disparity between the characters/lovers made it difficult for me to buy into their relationships. I would recommend it as a fun summer read because it was that."
1,No Information,"The book held no substantive information on the schools or programs. All it did was outline the schools by state, and the programs offered with no information on admissions or the programs themselves. You would be much better served by saving your money and surfing the web."
3,disappointing,"True, this book has almost every imaginable word you would need if visiting Russia or trying to communicate with your new child from Russia BUT it does NOT have any pronounciation help. Every word is written, well, in the Russian alphabet. So unless you can read Russian letters and pronounce them, this book is really no help."
4,Beautiful and a must see but falls short of his previous work,"It is still Miyazaki, but simplified, too simplified for my taste. I found it lacking his usual complexity, layers of meaning and depth. It is definitely worth watching though: beautiful story, beautiful animation, but it did not have the profound effect on me his other movies had."
5,How Beautiful can a movie be?,"This movie demonstrates a magic surreal quality. The tale itself is warm but heart wrenching, the characters are endearing and the portrayal exquisite.If you have a little girl (aged 7 or 8) to buy for, she will love this movie. The reason I say 7 or 8 is that there is a question about the survival of a Father at one point in the movie which may be upsetting to a younger audience."
5,ponyo,This is such a great movie. My 4 year old grandaughter loves this movie she will sit there and watch it over and over. I have seen it about 50 times since I got it for her.She Loves it.
4,Very Cute Instant Classic,"This is yet another genius and instant anime classic to come from Studio Ghibli. Based on the Disney classic Areal, Ponyo follows the same basic storyline but in a different and original way. Like other animes by Hayao Miyazaki this one also contains a strong message about taking care of our planet and keeping balance in the world. The animation was great, the story had depth and value, the soundtrack fit the story and evoked the right emotions at the right time, and the character development was there. This is a great anime for all ages, appealing to children, teens, and even finiky young adults. A definite must have for any anime collection!"
5,Great Purchase.,I was very happy with my purchase. It was exactly like the description said it was and I'm very happy with the seller's honesty.
5,Miyazaki does it again,"I adored this movie. If you are a true Miyazaki fan, you will too. Its got less of a plot in it than other films such as Howls, but its still amazing. It sucks you in with that true Miyazaki feel. I always get a comforted feeling when Im watching these films, and this one was nothing different. Love love loved it!"
2,Disappointing!,"Incredible music by incredible band is horribly disappointing when the sound quality is barbaric. I've heard bootlegs that sound infinitely better. Can you say ""rip-off""!!"
4,Perfect for projects,"I've been using these magnets in device designs for my experiments in conjunction with Arduino. It's a really powerful magnet, and sticks pretty well even at lower Voltages+Amps than which it's rated for (12V). I've been powering these @ ~5V 40mA with Arduino and it's not the strongest stick, but still does and can hold a few pounds. Great little lock. I can't say much for the mounting bracket it comes with (it's really meant for doors). I ended up just mounting the magnets with epoxy, which worked fine."
3,A Decent Movie...,"This was an ok movie. When you see previews for it on your TV or at other movies, you think it will be absolutely hilarious. WRONG.It was not that funny; the only funny parts were the parts you saw in the commercials. I laughed a couple of times, but don't expect too much from it... The plot was ok (Dad wants to get to know son, etc.), but not that great.If you're wanting to see it, wait a while to see it at the dollar theater or rent it when it is available, don't waste your money...So in short, I give this movie a decent rating of 3 stars."
2,Eddie's worst movie!,"This movie was as funny as changing an old person's diaper! I love Eddie Murphy, but I didn't find this movie to be very funny. If you want to see Eddie Murphy at his best, see Delirious! This one stunk."
4,Daddy Day Care,"This movie review that I going to tell you is Daddy Day Care.This is a story about a man named Charlie (Eddie Murphy)who has a nice job and is about to send his child into a strict and expensive school.But after he visited the school, he rush down to his office and his boss told him that he was fired with his friend Phil (Jeff Garlin)Not long after they were fired,they decided to open their own Day Care Centre and they named it Daddy Day Care.Things were out of control at first until Marvin(Steve Zahn)came and help.He knows how to take care of children.Soon the three of them became good friends.One of the funny part is when two little girl putting make up on a man face while the man was sleeping."
3,Daddy Day Care,"Purely family entertainment that is a fun look at two dads trying to make a go of a day care center after losing their jobs. Considering the alternatives they have a jump on the competition. Taking care of pre-school kids is by no means easy and we get to see most of the challenges. We get to see a little fun poked at a strict school along with a few in home type businesses. Eddy Murphy and the rest the cast do a good job making us laugh at the pratfalls and kids as they go through growing pains in learning the best way to keep the kids and parents happy. If you enjoyed this catch ""Dr. Doolittle"".CA Luster"
2,Josh Enden,I have to admit dat Eddie Murphy has had some stinkers before but dis movie takes da cake. Da only thing that made this movie worth seeing was Eddie Murphy's kid. Other than dat dis movie was crap man. Its full of cheap laughs. Except u aint even laughen. Ur more like crying. Eddie Murphy used to be like my idle. But like now hes like not havin good movies. I dont think dat u should consider watchin dis movie.Wait til its on tv. And if u like it then u can record it. I think dat instead of buyin dis movie u should buy Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison.
2,ok at best with a few funny scenes,Eddie Murphy use to really bring it at the Movies but that seems so long ago.this film has some funny moments in spots but been there&done that already.the kids are really the carrying point of this film.
4,4-1/2 stars -- A great family comedy,"I wanted to see this movie as soon as I saw the trailer. And I'm sure glad I did, because the movie is great (and yes, if you were wondering, the bathroom incident IS the funniest scene). Charlie (Eddie Murphy) and Phil (Jeff Garlin) work at a food product corporation until their department gets the boot. So to pass the time, they open a day care center in Charlie's house, which inadvertently starts some competition against Mrs. Harridan (Angelica Huston)'s ""prestigious"" pre-kindergarten school.As I said before, the movie is overall good, and the outtakes are hilarious. I would've liked it a little better if Charlie and company found out how their fair was sabotaged (WE see how it happens, though). All in all, though, Daddy Day Care is definitely worth watching."
3,"Good Story, Plays Slowly","The story is a new twist on the ""caught behind enemy lines"" concept. It could only be believable if it really happened - and it did. Just the idea of it reeks with excitement. The story is historical fiction and well written, but needs more work with an editor to maintain the necessary suspense of the storyline. The middle portion of the book slows the story down to the same pace as life on the remote island. Many pages pass without advancing the main theme of the story. From the first page the reader wants to know, ""What happens, what happens to the pilot?"" The ponderous middle section of the book nearly kills the suspense of the story line. Eventually the excitement does return, and again, for the first time since the beginning of the book, I read each word with a yearning for the next. The conclusion does not disappoint; it is not an ending you would likely to have guessed before hand."
2,Book Reading Groups Beware!,"Our bookgroup scheduled a speakerphone chat with Donna Woolfolk Cross, author of the ""other"" Pope Joan, and I bought this book by accident! I was so confused when everyone said how much they loved the book -- only to find out I had read the wrong one. I had so much trouble participating in the conversation because I had so much trouble slogging through this Royidis/Durrell version of the story.The Royidis/Durrell version of Pope Joan is sl-o-o-o-w moving, old-fashioned (after all, it's more than 100 years old), and dull. In contrast, the Cross version is fast-paced, riveting and impossible to put down! The notes at the end of the Cross book, documenting her research, are fascinating, and make it so clear that Joan was more than a fantasy.If you insist on reading this version, read it for comparison purposes only, and enjoy a good snooze. If you want a great read, accompanied by actual historical reference, purchase the Cross version of Pope Joan."
3,Amount but less variety.,Save your bills. This movie might have an average attractive woman and a couple other woman that take it off. The fact is though lots of the erotic scenes are repeated and in the scenes that aren't repeated the movement is mostly too fast and the plot is too upsetting.
5,Because of Degrasi everybody looked forward to Thursdays.,Every week my geography teacher used to show degrasi junior high. we would all look forward to school and his class. it was always the talk of the team and it got us all thinking.
5,Wish I would have read this a Long time ago...,"This was good stuff. I'm recommending this book to everyone I know who is trying to raise good kids. I only wish I had thought of these things myself! It was very educational for me and it ""felt"" right."
2,Unneccesary rancor & circular logic,"It seems that she is saying that:1) Kids today are screwed up because their parents get advice from experts.2) Parents should stop listening to advice from those experts and, instead, follow her advice.My own personal opinion is that every kid needs a responsible, involved parent who takes the time to understand them & discover what it takes to teach them what they need to know to become responsible adults themselves and to lead a good life.If the advice that the author has regarding parenting works for you to teach your kids what they need to know to be responsible adults, then follow it (or use the parts that work for you & your family). I think that the parenting advice in here could have been presented without putting down other parenting methods that most certainly do work for other parents and families."
3,Appears too old,"After fumbling with the tape dispenser and wasting about 8"" of tape, I finally got it to work. Hope it continues to work."
3,"Great for Boyz fans, mediocre at best as a musical product.","Well, I stopped being an absolute fanatic around the release of Take Me to Your Leader, mostly because my musical tastes changed. However, I had a soft spot for the boyz in my heart, cause of great hits like ""shine"" or ""breakfast"". So I picked up this CD. I was enjoying the first four tracks, (I think WooHoo, Step up to the Mic, Entertaining angels, and believe all range from pretty good to excellent) but I got severly bored with the remaining 6 trax. It's like I cant tell the difference between the last 6 songs. there is no musical ingenuity in any of them to distinguish them. The lyrics seemed to be a bit forced also.John James is severley missed on this album, and I wish Steve Taylor wrote more than two songs on this one, cause he is a great writer.Overall, a good buy for 'Boyz fans, not bad for the Newsboys newcomer. I would suggest that the new ""Boyz fan start with Take Me to Your Leader."
3,Not as good,"I didn't think this was as good as Take Me To Your Leader. There are some really good songs but the rest are just sort of ok. If you like the Newsboys it's still worth the money, though. But wait until its on sale."
5,awesome lyrics and sound.,my first christian concert. it was so uplifting. i could not stop listening to them. step up to the microphone is my favorite. i want to share your music with so many people. and i do! my girlfriend and i took our 14 year old daughters and they jumped the whole time. it was my daughters very first concert. you left quite a lasting impression with us. stay the way you are and don't ever let it go to your head because that would just ruin it. we all need your kind. God's blessings to all of you and i hope to see you again.
5,BEST MUSIC CD IN THE WORLD!!!!,"I guess I am partial, 'cause Newsboys just happen to be my all time favorite band of all time! This cd is their best one yet."
5,These White Boys Are Tuff,"I am an African American woman and I love the latest Newsboys CD ""Step Up To The Microphone"". These songs are funky, head-swaying, easy to learn, interesting, melodic, with enJOYable beats. I LOVE IT."
5,BUY IT!!!!!!!!,"I refused to listen to Christian music until I saw the Newsboys in March of 1999. Within three weeks, I had all three of their newest releases. They are beyond amazing. The songs on ""Step Up to the Microphone"" are varied in style, and the lyrics are unbelievable. ""Entertaining Angels"" is my favorite song in the world, and will forever be my anthem. If this CD can turn me into a Christian rock fan, it can turn anyone into a Christian rock fan. Buy it now!!"
4,"Ewwww, read this one!","here's a little story. once upon a time a girl named kaycie went to a newsboys concert. she had pretty bad seats that were almost all the way in the back. well kaycie got a little upset. she grabbed her friend jade by the arm and dragged her to the front. after much moshing, crowd surfing, and pushing kaycie made it to the very front of the crowd. she was so close that the newsboys' bassist waved to her. after that concert kaycie definately recommends this cd."
5,Step Up to the Microphone is the greatest!!!,"This is the best Christian rock music that I have ever heard!! The music is upbeat, which is great for teen listeners like me, but when you listen to the words, they are uplifting, also. ""Entertaining Angels"" and ""The Tide"" are my two favorites. The music is awesome and the words are inspirational. I managed to get one of my friends hooked on Newsboys, too. It's great!!"
2,Nice Machine - Sony Has No Customer Service Skills!,"The Sony Vaio RZ22G is a nice system - with lots of software - DVD-RW/+RW / lots of ports / just about everything you might need. Except - hmmmm - the video software ... - Call Sony about a problem with it during the support period - and after an automated survey of questions - then someone that doesn't even know anything about the computer gets on the phone to help you - need I say more - you ask for a supervisor - they put an ""expert"" on the phone - and still nothing. SONY HAS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! If they did - with their nice machines - they would be good competition for the big guys - e.g. DELL -but - SONY HAS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!"
5,Aamir and Kajol have great chemistry,I love this movie! It is probably the most unpredictable movie I have ever seen. It may be heart-breaking but it is so good. It is perfect for true Aamir Khan and Kajol fans.
3,Too long.,"It should have ended at the point of intermission. The last half of the movie made it unbelievable, and I did not appreciate the terrorist element in it. I was hoping for just a love story."
5,Great Album from the South Park Psycho!!,"I wasn't feeling this album at first. After awhile it grew on me and now it is one of my favorite albums by him....""South Park Psycho"" comes first. NIP's albums are extremely rare, and basically you can only buy the albums directly from him. NIP got a deal with another record label so keep an eye open for a new Ganxsta NIP album titled ""Return of the Psychopath."" Hopefully amazon will get units when the time comes.Anywayz, this album is great and it is some violent music. If you love psycho music like Brotha Lynch Hung, then you will like Ganxsta Nip."
4,"If you have a gifted child, have them read this book","I found this book when I was twelve, and it changed my perspective on being ""gifted"" considerably. Nathaniel Bowditch was beyond gifted, he was a genius of high proportion, but never considered himself better than anyone else simply because he was smarter. At the same time he used his gifts, even when those around him would think he was being a snob for doing so. He neither denied nor trumpeted his gifts, which is extraordinary.It's also a darn good tale of a really interesting guy, and how he changed the world of navigation."
3,Carry on Mr. Bowditch,"I am a reader at...school. I liked this book because the auther realy gets into the detail. It teaches you alot about sailing and it feels that you are actualy in the book. When you read it it seems like it would be a nonfiction book but it is actualy a fiction book. If you like reading nonfiction books or books that teach you new words, then you will like this book. The author is Jean Lee Latham. If you liked Holes then you probully will like this book because there are lots of adventures.The book is about a boy named Nat Bowditch. He wants to go to Havered. He learns lots of things about sailing. He goes on many voyages. During the voyages he had lots of adventures. There are lots of sad things that happen in nat's life."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This ""book"" is probably one of the worst examples of literature I have ever read. Pathetic use of word choice, the whole plot was extremely dull. The most annoying part was how ""perfect"" Mr. Bowditch's life is (was)! Everything just goes his way- even his enemies end up looking up to him in the end! NO ONE acts this way! Oh- his perfect life? Well the only un-perfect part is that probably half his fmaily dies. Before you scorn me for saying ""perfect"" when he had all this loss- it really didn't seem to hurt him that much. Everyone felt sorry for him- so all the more he gained. He didn't even seem at all sad. The book would be like ""And his poor, dear sister died of whatever"" and he would be all ""oh, I'm sad. :( Oh well, better get back to being happy ol' me again! La la la la..."" PLease- buy some better book- not this pitiful excuse of one."
4,Yall must be crazy!!!,"Okay check it....4 all yall that said shawnna albums is wack, you need to stop smoking. Shawnna is one of the coldest female rappers out there. So that means that if any other female out there is about to come out, they really need to up their game. I like tracks like ""Kick this One"" and ""Let's Go"". And that Twista song R.P.M. still goes hard. All I gotta say is if yall wannna hear a new tight female rapper that isn't a Ho (Foxy,Lil Kim, you know who they are)then cope this album. She's a lady slash gangsta and she reps all the way through her album. And for all you shawnna fans make sure you check out one of her concerts, she will BLOW you mind forreal. I went to one when she was touring with DTP last year and she took the show. I mean every verse she rapped it was like time stopped and when she finished everybody went crazy. Get this album!!!"
3,she's aiight,Her music is ok but she let the beat ride too long with nothing to say at the end and that made it lame real quick. She isn't as hard on her cd as she is with DTP.
3,Hot......but kinda lukewarm at the same time,"I thought Shawnna would come harder than this. It is ok, but I was sort of disappointed. He is hot when she is spitting on someone else's album, but kinda ""suck"" when it comes to her own. It's ok, but I wouldn't buy it. Listen to it first, or try to burn it from a friend if they let you."
4,"Good, but has some flaws!","Much better than Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practioner. As a matter of fact, I really, really, like his idea of coming up with a specific ""tradition"" that is all your own.And, yet again, the whole anti-Witch let's all just be light all the time attitude really got on my nerves. I have Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Badb who is a Crone Goddess who is known as ""The Fury"" helps me deal with my pain and fights at my side when I need Her to. I don't know what I would do without Her, just like I don't know what I'd do without Kwan Yin/Mother Mary. Not to mention the Maiden. They are all needed!Shadow Work and recognition of our Shadow Selves is neccessary. And the Dark aspects of Deity help us to deal with our deepest pain. I have always kind of thought of Wicca and Witchcraft as one in the same, but maybe they really aren't and maybe I'm more of a Witch than a Wiccan."
4,An Excellent Guide to Wicca,"Cunningham's work in this sequal to his wonderful ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" is great. I didn't find this one to be as strong as the original, but I found it to be informative and useful, nonetheless. As a whole, Cunningham's work is very straight forward and easy to absorb and implement. I highly recommend this book to newcomers to the Wiccan religion."
5,Solitary Tradition,"This is an EXCELLENT book if you are new to the craft. If you've only been reading from groups on line and/or websites. This is a MUST book, some of the information out there is wrong or misleading. Get this book and you'll be able to tell the difference. I've used what I've learned from this book as well as others from Scott Cunningham to start my own tradition on MSN, Modern Witches.Buy the book, learn the facts and enjoy the wonders given to us from God/dess.Merry Meet, Merry Part and Merry Meet Again,Rev. Praduc"
4,Great for the beginner Solitary,"Cunningham is a very talented author, and Living Wicca is one of his greatest books. It is devoted to the Solitary Practitioner, helping the individual to create your own tradition, develop your relationship with the God/dess, ritual design, create your Book of Shadows, and even perform a self-initiation. There is a great chapter on Wiccan beliefs and ""rules"" that translate the Laws of the Ordains into plain language that is much more accessible to the beginner. At the end of this book, you will have a greater understanding of the everyday practices of Wicca, as well as a deeper connection with the God/dess"
2,Ok but needs a redesign,"This money belt is soft and comfortable against your skin. However, the tie has a tendency to roll and dig into your back. It helps if you thread the tie through the belt loops on your trousers, but then you must wear your shirt on the outside of your trousers. The belt has two plastic half circles to thread the tie through to tighten it. The stitching is not close enough to the half circles to keep them in place. They slip through each other and the tie loosens. This isn't too much of a problem if you have threaded the tie through the trouser belt loops and put all the extra length of the tie in your back pocket. Otherwise, you might find yourself fishing down a trouser leg to find the money belt. With a few changes, though, this could be a winning product."
3,The beginning of the end,"Many seem to consider this to be one of AD II's last great recordings. The bottom line is that you probably need to have Phallus Dei and Yeti before you splash out for this one. After the outstanding opening track, the remainder of the disc consists of jams of various lengths, all of which pale compared to the groups first two offerings."
4,Great for sticking to paper,"This is the tape to get if you are labeling paper or cardboard items, like manila file folders, shoeboxes, or suchlike.It does NOT stick well to plastic or glass, but will start to lift & curl after a few days (depending on humidity, I suppose.) Don't use it if you are labelling VHS cassettes or those little glass spice jars -- you need the plastic tape for those projects.I keep both kinds of labelling tape in the house, because it's so easy to pop the cartridge in & out -- there's no wasted tape. Get some of each!"
1,Very Disappointed,"The title of this book is very misleading. Mr.Jensen speaks very little about the actual show and alot about John Schneider in a very negative way. This book is nothing but Mr.Jensen bashing Mr. Schneider. It is sour grapes. I won't even try and resell this book,I'll use it as kindling."
1,Authors point of view skewed beyond reality.,"I have read the book, while I had seen a few of the reviews years ago I decided against it then. I got a tablet and it was cheap so I gave it a shot. I did try my best to like it and find good in it. In the end I have to agree with the negative reviews here. The whole book was very negative about John mainly, though everyone gets the ax at some point. Richard comes off as very upset that he did not make it as big or bigger than John and that John did not do enough to make him big. While I understand it is Richards point of view. It is not one that even tries to look at all sides or to give credit were credit is due, aside from a few very small places. In short this book was a cash in. At the expense of everyone Mr. Jensen met, spoke to, or saw from a distance. The positive reviews try to gloss the bad parts over and in a point or two they may have a leg but its very thin and wooden at best. I can not recommend this book to anyone even my worst enemy."
2,boring,I respect dyson as an intellectual and his rhetoric is awesome however this book kinda sucks.A couple of the chapters are great the others not so much.I started to read like a normal book from front to back and realized I would not be able to get through it like that.I read chapters according to what sounded interesting.Black fists and the chapter on mlk and tupac were pretty good but the rest was just a drag.Dysons rhetorical flow and debates are top notch but his books have been a letdown to me.
2,"This may work for some, but not for me!","This product is supplied without any instructions for installation, although there are two schematic circuit diagrams printed on top of the box. However, the possible connection options are not obvious and require interpretation. I could not get these horns to work properly together. Calling Hella tech support did not help. I was forced to return the product."
4,Good effort,"This band is a good band which plays mainly poppier, keyboard style music in keeping with the '60s scene but some tracks are close to genius.ie. Cant seem to make you mine, when they decide to play like that you cant complain.They are less raw than the shadows of the knights, but they play same sort of sound. Nice stuff. These white middle class garage stars have their fame made on this album.The way the singer sings is a bit strange at times, i think he might need to seek medical attention, or was it the drugs? Hmm anyway. good music, which at times is genius and at others is tame, but you cant deny their part in the garage scene."
4,Great beat,I wanted the cd for one song that i liked but it turned out thati like the whole cd. I also like amazon.com for its great service.
3,not too much,"i expected this book to bee more profeshinal , you can see that the Writer (most of the time) just playing with the program and not teaching you important things, they could done better please e-mail me for replay"
2,GOOD,"SHIPED VERY FAST, THE PRODUCT PLAYS GREAT, NO ISSUES AT ALL, REAL IMPREESED WITH HOW FAST IT WAS. JUST GREAT!!!"
2,"Pointless ""upgrade"" with even more pointless bonus tracks","Be warned: sonically speaking this new upgrade is no different that the version of this that was available many years ago. And the bonus tracks are of very recent vintage NOT from when this album was recorded. So if you like drum machines and samplers etc (which is what the bonus tracks use to a very noticable degree) go ahead and buy it. But otherwise you might feel royally screwed like I did after getting rid of the old versions and spending quite a bit of cash to upgrade all the albums only to find that they sound EXACTLY the same! This is a great album but this new ""upgrade"" sounds just as horrible as every single version of it (including the original vinyl issue) ever has."
4,"I can relate, having the joy of 8!","I feel like I know this woman, really. We had (still have) 8 lively kids and lived in the midwest for many years. Many of her recollections resemble our very busy household.In this strange world where expressing your everyday faith and Christianity is akin to political incorrectness, it is refreshing to read some downright honesty in daily living.A fun book that is a bit like James Harriot and his animal short stories, nice for easy, humorous reading, always with some roots in a lesson to learn."
4,Textbook,Had to have this for my nursing curriculum and it was a good price and just what I needed so bought from amazon - quick and easy and didn't have to go searching in the bookstore! NOW I'm AN RN!!
5,great product >>> great price,Shopped locally but could not find a good quality set of bongos. Order the LP's and they are an incredible sounding piece of equipment. Extremely happy with their performance.
1,Trash fest,"If the religious right needs more fuel for their anti-gay crusades, I'm sure they would be happy to add this film to their ammunition. Promiscuous sex, drug use and the whole concept of an older gay couple using a young boy as their ""toy"" is bad enough. Nick May is very good in the title role and manages to create a sympathetic portrayal of a young guy desperately in need of love. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the script basically only uses one sexual encounter after another to paint his plight. The last five minutes promises a glimpse of what this film could have been. Too bad the viewer has to sit through total dreck to get there."
3,The Houseboy,"good, but disappointing. some good scenes, but can't be helped by somebad editing. the would have been a good chance to show more realisim in the film in connection with the young man and his keepers"
3,"I fear we have woken a sleeping giant...Adm. Bob Yamamoto, 1942","I saw this film when I was very young and it gave me nightmares for weeks. I dreaded falling asleep every night for the same nightmare would eventually replay itself in my innocent mind. It would start off with me in the middle of a dark forest, alone and confused. A wild howling could be heard in the distance, gradually coming closer. As it came closer, it would circle me. Thru the trees I could glimpse angry red eyes intently focused on me, the howling turning to a viscious snarl. The moon would break through and I could see a large furry shape, with strange humps and ridges. Large white knife-like teeth could be discerned in the dim light. Next, there I was alone with this huge beast crouching before me, ready to...uh, wait a sec...is this the review place for ""The Creature from the Grey Lagoon""? It's not? Opps! Sor-ree!"
1,Lousy support,"I purchased the PCG-V505P from Sony in Australia. Same problems with the mousepad not functioning. Sony support in Australia is incredibly bad - it took them 3 weeks to just reply to my inquiry on their local support website to tell me where to take it in for service and then they said it would take 5 days or longer to repair. By comparison, Toshiba send a courier to pick up a faulty unit in warranty and return it the next day. You'd be crazy to purchase Sony if you're a serious business user. I'll live without a usable mousepad until my next PC purchase (not Sony)"
3,problem with mouse pad and keyboard,"I own this unit for 2 months. I also have the problem with mouse pad and keyboard. It usually start clicking itself. I have to use the external mouse instead. The cursor jumps during I am typing sometimes. Otherwise, this is a good laptop to work with according to the acceptable quality of monitor, performance, light weight, and speed."
2,Literary license taken to a new level..,"Entirely beside the fact that the author lacks some basic grammar and punctuation skills, the way this book is written is speculative at best and pure fantasy at worst. Some of the events depicted are just plain nonsense, and the 'inside the mind' view taken of the central characters is a schmaltzy 'lets all worship at the altar of feminism' weep-fest. The author also takes a swipe at other writers who dared to criticise the behaviour of the women depicted. Painful to get through and a bitter dissapointment after the thoroughly enjoyable Last Man on the Mountain."
3,Wait for 'Malcolm and Eddie' DVD...,"...while he IS a stand up comic and I am...I am simply a lowly peon in the overall scheme of things...I feel that things could be funny widdout all the offal talk and cuzz words, but some folks I understand you have to hit over the head with an I-beam before you show'em funny.However, to paraphrase another famous Eddie..""What do I know from funny?""I delighted in Griffin's Undercover Brother and the Malcolm and Eddie TV show and know that the dude is drop-down hilarious.What I found unintintionally funny in this show is Eddie telling the kids (on the school bus on the way to KC's Lincoln Jr. High, perchance?) about his dance corp/drill team and how after hedid his biz with the team he got his studies in also. The thought of Griffin trying to get the kids to follow the right path was kinda frightening and funny to me, but I am a different kinda dude.Griffin's ""Live on Sunset"" is yet to come. This is funny, but unfortunately not on that level of comic concerts."
3,"Not so ""Solid"", brother","Funny in places. My favourite part as far as laughs were concerned was Eddie's brilliant impersonations of celebrities at the very end of the show. Was aiight, some cute recollections about his family and growing up. Very brave to have his family featured and show a glimpse of the real interactions and relationships within his family. However I was left feeling this performance lacked a coherent theme. He had some real potential for an even better/funnier, possibly meaningful show following the theme of his family and their quirks."
1,"Hershey's ""Special Dark"" Cocoa - ""Special Disapointment""","I used to buy the old version (silver box). My whole family loved it. It was the best affordable European Style cocoa powder on the market. I used it for everything, from hot cocoa, brownies and birthday cake fillings to chocolate mousse and truffles. It was rich, smooth and had a wonderful chocolate flavor. It was great!!!This year, before Easter, I run out of cocoa. I went to different stores trying to find my favorite cocoa - Hershey's European Style. I couldn't find it! I called Hershey's to see if I could order some and I was told they don't make it anymore, the updated version is the special dark. I bought it but I promise not to make this mistake ever again! It is black, without any flavor, and very unpleasant. If this is Hershey's specialists idea of ""European Style - Dutch Processed Cocoa"" they are wrong! Maybe they need a trip to Holland to drink some good dark cocoa and attend some training!"
1,New special dark not as good as old silver can dutch cocoa,"I've used the silver can dutch cocoa for years and have always loved it. This Special Dark version is darker and does not taste nearly as good as the silver can variety. I had to make two batches of chocolate icing, and I only had enough silver can cocoa for one, so I used the new stuff for the second batch. The colors were completely different. The Special Dark version was almost black and didn't taste nearly as good. I had to mix the two batches together so that my cake didn't look bad. I think that people in my area aren't so impressed with the Special Dark version -- I've noticed that it is no longer available at any of my local grocery stores."
4,It was a good book...,"although, for lack of free time, it took me just under six months to read this book, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It seemed to help expand my imagination, and consider possibilities that I've never thought about before. It had all the elements to make a good book... and just in case you're wondering.... IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE!! :):)"
3,VERY THOUGHT-PROVOKING,"It's important to not draw any conclusions about this book till you've finished it. So many questions are addressed, and so many different philosophical points of view presented, it's tempting to try to second-guess the author's own perspective on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence. Specifically, did Carl Sagan believe in God, or not? But he doesn't truly reveal himself till the last few pages. And it's worth the wait; the story's closing is very satisfying. One caveat: The book can get pretty bogged down in the development of too many characters. I myself only really cared about Ellie Arroway and Palmer Joss."
2,Disappointing first contact with Sagan the novelist,"I loved Sagan on TV and I loved Cosmos, but I didn't love Contact. Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the ""real science"" aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many unauthentic long speeches). All in all a great disappointment"
5,"Amazing, entertaining , a great book","Great book for all ages with a little scientific background. Carl Sagan explains that humans are not alone in this vast universe we occupy. In a few words, a must have book from a great man. The movie was great too."
3,A movie better than the book?!?,"Although Sagan's novel wasn't bad, the movie was in fact better. Sagan tends to go off on a tangent for three chapters and goes into extraordinary amounts of detail about some things, and not nearly enough about others. The book seems to be even closer to how such an event would happen in real life than the movie, but to the point where it becomes tedious and boring at times. Character development in the movie was actually better. Read the book if you have the chance, definately go see the movie!"
5,Undoubtedly the best!!!,"WOW!! I REALLY REALLY loved the movie! Ellie is no doubt the person I most admire in the whole world! Well Jodie Foster was superb in the movie, I think she at least deserves an oscar nomination for that ! And I FULLY agree with one of the people who'd written a review here...Helen Hunt is such a twit! She's what we call a ""ball of rice"" here....no brains, no acting....anyway, CONTACT RULEZ!"
4,Very interesting and fascinating,"I loved the book, but was a little bit disspointed with the ending."
4,"Is this a science, fiction or religion book?","This book is about more than just an invitation from Aliens: It shows what would happen, IF we got in contact with another species. It describes all the conflicts, religious problems and how the government would deal with such a unknown situation. The book is much more detailed than the movie, and that's probably why Carl Sagan (the author) didn't like the movie. I enjoyed reading the book because it makes you think. And you stop reading a lot of times just to think for yourself about the topic! Nevertheless, some scenes seem to be too unreal, like Dr. Arroway's trip to the Space Station during such a hectic situation while planning the ""Real Journey"". No wonder the film team left those sequences out. The book also gets some times repetitive. To sum it up: I would say it is worth reading, but don't expect any unknown wisdom in it!"
2,"book, Contact",I saw the movie first and I liked the movie. I didn't like the book and did not finish it. I am going to give it to my local library. Order and delivery was great.
4,excellent,"Jerry Goldsmith was unique among 1960s film composers. He did not have a set style, as Lalo Shafrin did jazz funk and Quincy Jones high end blues.But Goldsmith was great at making a score that really fit a movie, and the flutes and rascalish themes here really fit the light spy fare of the Flint films.This music is pure 60s, and is fantastic for it. All the electric harpsichords and elegant, post-Pepper sounds are here. This is the type of music that is the textbook for bands like Stereolab, who have made careers of riviving and in some cases reinventing this long forgotten style.Get into this Flint."
3,This 20th Century Fox soundtrack gem needs a 21st Century re-issue...,"This is nitpicking, I know, but this album was the reason why I became a lover of movie soundtracks in the first place. The version I grew up with was the re-recording of the soundtrack on vinyl, issued in conjunction with the film. Purists may rejoice, as this new version is taken directly from the tracks used to score the movie itself, and therefore contains about a half-dozen tracks not available on the vinyl version. Because you do get both soundtracks for the price of one, I give it three stars. Now if they'd included both OUR MAN the redo vs. OUR MAN the original, it would've gotten FIVE stars!Still, for nostalgia's sake, it's worth checking out."
2,everything they say is true,"everything the other reviewers say here is true. i bought my grz630 in march '03 and after about a year found the battery to last for only around 10mins before shutdown. then the overheating which sometimes causes it to shutdown without warning, and sometimes 'simply' slows the machine down to the point of not being able to use it. i would need lots of reassurances that sony have solved this problem before i bought another sony laptop."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable local historical mystery,"As a Houston resident, I chose this book because I am interested in fiction set in my home city. However, this one is like no other. The Apothecary's Demise foregoes guts and gore for an off-beat historical setting.Set in pre-suffrage Houston, Sloan does a fine job of bringing old Southern Houston alive, warts and all. Her heroine is a white suffragette who's earnest struggle for the truth can get a little grating (but only a little) as she helps out the young relative of her black housekeeper.Sloan's glimpses into historic Houston -- particularly the Heights neighborhood -- as well as the cast of turn-of-the-century American characters keep the reader interested.Really pleasant gentle read without the sap."
4,Very good lamp,"Hi guys, I'm from Brazil and this lamp here cost about U$ 800. So I decided to bought ir from Amazon. The image is clear and very bright, and really seams like I have started using my projector at first time. However I notice that, when I looked closely to the screen, I saw 2 pixels when nothing was reflected. It was black instead of white. So I classified 4 stars."
3,durable ball but not durable enough,It took our pitbull less than a half hour to destroy this ball which is what he does. Based on reviews i thought this would be just the thing. I bought two and we put one away for catch but we cannot leave the dog alone with this item and have it survive.
4,"Very Durable, but Very Heavy!","My dog and I really enjoy playing with this ball! It has a good bounce to it, however it is quite heavy and will make a lot of noise when used indoors. If you live in an apartment, definitely pass on this one (look in to the Petstages Orka ball).This is an easy choice over a tennis ball for me, as he has a tendency to strip the fabric off of tennis balls then chew them in to pieces... Overall, I'm very happy with it!"
4,I Loved It!,"This book is great fun, intriging and suspensful. I love new authors - this one is really different. Highly recommend it."
3,Aztec by Gary Jennings,"Read it because my sister made me. Lots of words to look up in the dictionary, some don't appear even there. Seems 1/3 of the book could be deleted without missing anything. Not my type of fiction."
5,Incredible,"An amazing story about life, love, and tragedy. It took me on a journey to another world."
4,faithful to description - great price!,"Was disappointed not to find an electronic version of this book, and very happy to find a copy at a great price and in good condition. Shipped quickly and was true to description of slightly used - great shape overall!"
2,"Long, long and long","Though I give the man credit for exploring the culture and history of the Aztecs so deeply, I can't say that I enjoyed the book. I felt no connection or emotions for any of the characters. In fact, my strongest feeling was usually one of repulsion. If you really want to know ALL the gory deatils of Aztec history, then by all means read this book. If you are looking for a historical fiction to transport you to another time, try something else."
1,Missing Pages 52-85 and pages 117-148 printed twice,Very dissatisfied with the printer of this book since pages 52-85 are missing and pages 117-148 are printed twice.
3,Narrative is annoying,"Having read James Clavell, this book was a disappointment. I was glued to this book after about 400 pages (and thats a lot of reading) and the next 700 pages or so were entertaining but there were often moments when I was forced to gloss over paragraphs. The book is the narrative of an aztec native, who is interrupted every chapter and sometimes in the middle of the text by the conquering Spanish for whom he is detailing his life. This is more often than not very very annoying. If you can ignore such interruptions, and the excessive details thrown in for not so good measure, you might enjoy the book. However the view that this provides into the ancient aztecs is truely marvellous."
5,"wow, what a book","I could not put this book down. It is one of the most incredible historical novels i have read in a long time. And Jennings has done his homework on aztec history and archaeology. Telling the story of the life of an Aztec commoner and how he rises through the ranks, and of the final confrontation with the Spanish invaders, Jennings gives you what i though was a very good approximation to the aztec's point of view of the whole thing. If you are into mesoamerican archaeology, you cannot miss this book."
5,if you don't know what to buy them here is the answer,"when i saw this gab i loved the genz one..i ordered it and was afraind that it won't be that good .. i wanted a bag to put my college books ,, coz they are really heavy plus other things i like to carry along with thr books .. and this bag solved my painfull problem .. my shoulder doesn't ache me and my staffs are safe now ..but when i recieved it .. i made an enner from cotton to make sure it's safer .. at the end i advise you people to buy this one ,, and i've already ordered the red one ^-^"
2,Hmmmm It's Okay,"I recently purchased this item from a store. The main reason I purchased this item is because I was in search of a juicer but I figured this was the better overall value since it can juice and do everything else. I was surprisingly disappointed. When I tried blending carrots to make carrot juice I could smell smoke from coming from the blades when I opened the top to check on the progress. To get it to stop I had to turn it off because I was having problems with my stop button. Most likely I will return the item since I am within my 1 year warranty period for a full refund. Also, this item is overpriced. I purchased it new in store for $50."
5,"RENT, unexpected and wonderful","I wasn't quite sure about RENT. I have not seen in on stage and now would love to. I loved all the actors and felt they were believable in their performance. It's a hard one to describe. In the FILM, even though they were all dirt poor, the second you came into their lives, you were ""family."" That was something striking about the film and I don't know why I picked that up. I could identify with every single character. You have to watch it with an open mind. The other unexpected outcome of RENT: I have an AUTISTIC 2 year old that will sit and watch the ENTIRE film. The first time we put the movie on, he stopped spinning a toy he had been playing with and walked right up to the TV. He sits in the bean bag to watch it. He actually tries to dance when ANGEL dances. He's interacting. This is a huge milestone for someone who is autistic. So you can see why RENT is an all around favorite of mine."
4,An amazing movie...,"If you do not compare it to the stage version. You cannot compare the two things at all, they are two complete different mean of entertainment.That said I thought the movie was very well done. The best thing was the cast, almost the entire OBC. The newcomers, Rosario and Tracie still knew the characters and all actors were true to who the characters are.The music is fun, the story is moving. The movie does have its flaws, but is overall very enjoyable. If you are a fan of Rent or like musicals in general check it out."
5,Oscar-Worthy Performance,"This movie is incredible, no doubt about it. From Taye Diggs to Rosario Dawson to Anthony Rapp to Idina Menzel, phenominal talent! I think though there is ONE performance that is worthy of at LEAST an Academy Award NOMINATION and that's Jesse L. Martin. Martin offers most of the laughs from the movie as well as makes the audience cry unlike any other performance this year. Martin's performance is exceptional and adds to the excellence of this incredible movie musical."
5,IS THERE A WORD BETTER THAN EXCELLENT?,"This was my ""first"" exposure to RENT so I had nothing to compare it to.I absolutely fell in love with the movie and all of the characters especially Tracie Thoms! I have all of my friends and family addicted to the movie now. I am now officially a RENT HEAD! I am so sad that I missed an entire decade of RENT. I loved the overall theme of the movie which for me was simply, LOVE, TRUE FRIENDSHIPS AND FAMILY! Tracie Thoms was so convincing in her role, it was so moving, I have cried every time, especially on the cemetary scene. I thought that everyone did an excellent job. It is so funny because, my favorite songs change from week to week and my favorite character changes from week to week;but, Tracie Thoms is my all time favorite! I was one of the people who paid the $20 to see the final stage performance at the movie theatre and I will be attending the stage performance in my city next month. TAKE A CHANGE ON THIS ONE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
1,HORRIBLE,"I LOVED the stage version with the original cast - I saw the play in 1996. AMAZING. Most of the actors were not Broadway performers, which added a sense of realism and urgency to the roles. However, this filmed version is so bland and boring it's barely watchable. My biggest complaint is the direction - the staged version had energy and sass - the film drags along until you can't wait for it to be over. I wish there was a filmed version of the original cast circa 1996. Avoid this movie."
2,The best song is missing from the movie!,"How could they possibly eliminate the best song of the play (""And it's beginning to snow"") from the movie, and claim the movie is a faithful reproduction of the play? And since the movie did not add anything new, we can only conclude the movie is inferior to the play, by a song. A big song."
4,two versions; one compelling story,I saw this first on IFC and had to have a copy.Don't miss the bonus stuff! Knowing the back story makes the whole project more meaningful.I also recommend seeing the stage version; some things just work better on stage.Beware! You may find these tunes running through your head for weeks aferwards.-- Bart
2,It just doesn't work.,"Disregarding all my love for Rent on stage, and all my respect for the actors, and yes, even my loathing of Chris Columbus' directorial attempts, the movie just doesn't work. Shots are so tediously placed to be ""artistic"" that it is distracting, and none of the actors really got their chance to show us their characters. There are some excellent parts (Santa Fe) and some terrible ones (What You Own Britney-style music video) but all in all it is mediochre. If you can't see the show on stage, see the movie. But do not judge the show by it. The experience is so different. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anybody unless they know that they will never get to see it on stage. It just feels flat and forced.Note how Roger and Mark throw their papers into the trash can to heat up their apartment. Then they grab hold of the aluminum can with their bare hands and toss the fire out the window. That is just something useless and distracting. The movie almost gets it right."
2,Not nearly as good the live show,"It is hard to recreate a live show and the director did not try to do that. I have seen Rent several times when it was still on tour and this movie does not come close to doing the story any justice. The movie took out a few numbers and changed the context of some of the story. It seems to drag on at times, which is disappointing. It is nice to see several members from the original cast, but event hey can't make this a great buy. I think the ""Live"" version is a much better purchase."
4,Nice selection,"I like the wide selection of music types included on this CD, from classical works to songs from musicals."
4,Why not this version over the reprint paperback?,"There is a new reprint of Goodwin's original version.A Greek GrammarMy question is why did they not reprint this newer edition? I now own both books. A quick over view suggest the the 'Goodwin and Gulick' edition may be better than the original.I have not compared these books in great detail, but I would at this point recommend buying a good used copy of this edition first. It is cheaper, it is more up to date (albeit still circa 1930, it is hardcover in a nice binding, and it has a type set and lay-out, which is a bit more user friendly. Also, if you decide to buy the reprint of the 'Goodwin' grammar, buy the Macmillian press edition. I own a 1963 hardcover edition, it has a great binding and is much better than the the new soft cover I bought for my friend; the contents are exactly the same."
1,Not for Beginners,"Maybe a four or five star video for intermediate to advanced students, but definitely not for beginners."
4,Reliable backup,UPS is very reliable. This is the second one we have purchased to support our server room. I have read that it is supposed to be rackmountable but not sure if we need other hardware. Other than that it is great.
4,A Good Place to Begin,"This was one of the first books I obtained when I became a Christian as a teen-ager many years ago. It was the only real ""hand-book"" that was available. It is a great place to start.It has its short-comings like every work, but it also has a wealth of information. The positive aspects of the work far outweigh the negative (unless you have your own ax to grind)."
1,Godawful,I got sucked into this mess from seeing the trailer some time ago. From the trailer I at least expected a real shocker--the gore goes by so quickly you couldn't even enjoy it. The only shocking thing was how tame and just downright stupid the whole thing was from beginning to end. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!
4,Four Stars For The Gore The Score The Skin and The Sex!,"This is movie is meant to be viewed only by those who are smart enough to realize that the director was not striving for a masterpiece. He was simply trying to create an outrageous ""exploitation"" film in every sense of the word, and succeeded. So if your a wimp who can't handle a little gore and sex, stick with the Disney flicks."
3,right candy,I was excited to get the thin ribbon candy since the stores in my neighborhood didnt have it available at christmas this year...however it was old ..not crispy like hard candy but spongy like old candy.....
5,"Moore, Hunt and Bernstein at their Best","GOLD is an oustanding film directed by Peter Hunt made shortly after his stint as an editor and director from the James Bond series where he made his lasting and distinctive mark. It is rich with characters, plot and raw energy and emotion. This film contains one of Roger Moore's best performances. Moore is very natural and believable in his role. Elmer Bernstein's inspired score goes above and beyond. The entire cast is first rate. On the down side the DVD print of this very good character based adventure is less than good and that is being kind. This is an outstanding film just the same. The plot to flood a huge gold mine in South Africa to increase the value of othere gold reserves is well done."
1,Sony pcg-grz610,"The fan can be adjusted to the ""quiet mode"" - it's in the manual.Also, after mine started over-heating and shutting down I soon figured out that the fan was filled with dust. I blew out the fan holes on the right side of the computer and a dust cloud came out the back. Ever since I regurlarly blow them out with either my mouth or a can of air. I have used the computer every day for almost 2 years and no problems ever again!"
2,Great game hampered by technical problems,"AC is addictive and a blast to play, but the constant server outages, technical problems and bugs that are introduced with each update, and the lag really hampers my enthusiasm. You would think with all the years the game has been in development, and the beta testing process, they would've been able to sort the problems out. I wish Turbine and MS would concentrate on fixing the problems with the game instead of new content every month."
2,Not worth the money,i played Ultima Online for 2 years... and now have played Everquest for 2 years... i played this game for 2 months and went back to EQ... this is just junk compared to the other 2...even old UO
5,Superb!,"Asheron's Call is an incredibly addictive game. From the moment I started playing, I was immediately drawn into it, with its deep backstory and unique features. The allegiance system, as described in other customer reviews here, is an interesting aspect found nowhere else. The magic system is also unique, creating an incentive for secrecy. The graphics are beautiful, but I would definitely recommend a 3D card (make sure it is compatible). Also, Turbine has promised to hold monthly events, involving the whole gameworld, adding new monsters, items, and quests. Many things make AC different from Ultima Online and Everquest (such as the non-traditional monsters..nothing from Tolkien), and I heartily recommend it! See you in Dereth!"
2,Not recommended for those with a life,"This is bound to be an unpopular review. Ever notice that panning a product is not considered helpful by most people? Once you get this far, you're hoping that the reviewers will ratify your purchase decision.Well, this is a great game, I imagine, if you're a gaming addict with nothing else to do. On the other hand, if you have other responsibilities and interests that will prevent you from investing many hours daily in this game, you should skip it altogether. It's way to complicated, and the other players are way too immersed in it, for you to have any fun with anything less than an all out effort. You simply cannot dip into this game for a half hour here and there and expect to glean anything but frustration. I played it for a couple of weeks, saw the writing on the wall, and cancelled my account."
5,Not at that price,"$22.99!!! I just bought this at Toys R Us for $4.44, Target also has it, Walmart too. What a rip off.Now an actual review, I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas, she loves horses and the Lil' pet shops. I am sure it is going to be a huge hit.5 stars because my daughters love these, but for price 0 stars. ACK!"
5,Great game!,This game is the best wrestling game that I have played in a long time! Works great and I will buy from this seller again.
4,Good but not great,"My 2 year old son wasn't thrilled with this 30-minute video and hasn't asked to watch it repeatedly like he does with the videos he really enjoys, maybe because he has other Sesame Street Videos and some of the bits and songs are used from other videos, so he is starting to get a little bit bored. However, he did enjoy the song about the rain, and he really likes to see anything with Zoey in it. Probably because Elmo isn't in it at all he doesn't take as much of an interest in it, as Elmo is the character he appears to feel the most comfortable with and helps link him with the other characters. Also it seems that the concepts in the video are for a slightly older child. Still, an enjoyable amd worthwhile video, as are all Sesame Street videos! I do prefer the newer 50 minute Elmo's World video formats, as does my son."
4,Good VCR for the price,"I seriously do not know why the people who have reviewed this product have had so many problems with this VCR. I've had mine since last January and have had no problems with it at all. While there's no denying the fact that it is loud, and that the unit is pretty light, this VCR, in my opinion, is pretty close to top of the line. It has good sound and the picture quality is great. The VCRplus+ is also really easy to use too. Just punch in a few numbers and it's ready to go. I also like the remote too. Even though the light feature only illuminates the play, stop, rew., and f.f. buttons, it's just the right size, and it has a very strong sensor (I can hold the remote about 1/2 inch away from a wall, facing the opposite direction, and it still gets a full signal. It's that good.). There's also some other nice features, but I won't get into that. Overall, if you want a nice VCR at a low price, you shouldn't have to look much further than the V4611."
3,"Flat heroine, marginally developed hero","I think the author didn't put more than skill into this novel, and I was very disappointed. I had hoped that she would turn the spoiled superior supercillious heroine into a real character but aside from a few superficial feints, Balogh added nothing to her. She did slightly better for the hero, partly because he had more background. I had been expecting a Freyja with the relative depth and resonance of her novelistic predecessors, who became full individuals in their own novels. Because I had anticipated a lot of depth and dimension that Freyja might have had, based bare hints in the earlier novels, I was expecting a much better book, not one in which the author seemed more fond of her hero than of the series-character whose story we readers had anticipated. This book reads almost (not quite) as if it were written to a plug-in formula."
5,I loved this book...,"The first book I ever read by Mary Balogh, Was * A summer to remember* in which you meet the Bedwyn family, in which I met Freyja ...and thought she was mean, most unromantic girl in romance fiction. Then this book took all those thoughts... and shoved them out the door...Freyja is written where you see her soul... and understand her tomboyish ways. Only a great writer can change the way you see someone and make her loveable. This book brought a couple of tears, and I never cry in romance books. (At least not often) You fall in love with her energetic... and want to do everything better then a man (You go girl). She is so funny and Joshua is dream come true (pant pant)I recommend it highly...I salute you Mary Balogh!"
5,The Dynasty Rulez,"This game is awesome.No questions asked.with way better graphicsthen the 2nd,DW3 is great fun.The voice-overs are to a ""T"",excepfor the girl on Cao Cao's Dynasty.She sound's very,very,preppy.Plus you get to earn your final weapon and get more then 3 hits.And know you get to play with 2 people instead of 1.Over all DW3is definetly worth buying and adding to your Dynasty WarriorsCollection."
5,Kicks ....Period.,"Words cannot describe how good this game is. Although I'm being biased by saying that it is the best re-ennactment of history, ever. I highly advise you to buy this game. It is worth every penny."
5,ITS GREAT!!!!!,i just bought this game and it is great. i love how you can get new items/weapons to customize your character. there is 40+ characters and they all look suprisingly different and each character has 4 weapons of their very own!!! there is a lot more different attacking combinations with cool combos. i havn't tried the 2 player yet but i can't wait. this game is great and a whole lot better than dw2 and gantlet legends and that says alot!!!
3,"Good resource, but wish it were a little bigger","My first thought on seeing the book was that it wasn't nearly big enough. About an inch thick, and I'd expected a huge volume. Looking into it confirmed this. I was specifically looking for the word ""eclipse"", and it wasn't there. On the plus side, GREAT comparative study between these languages. Separate sections for each language, then a comparative word list. Overall not bad, but wish it were a little more comprehensive."
1,nice try,"Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.video camera For video reviewsMake it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences wi"
5,WONDERFUL book!!!,Great book! I read this to my 4 year old and she loves it!Great way to teach children about separation and love.Amazon shipped fast as always :)
5,Fantastic Piece of work,"Wow!! what a timeless masterpiece, Hazel's music is still wonderfully exciting and vibrant, sung with a true passion and meaning. A Must Buy album that will grace anyones collection."
4,Powerful nihilism at its best,"Reminiscent of Lene Lovich's powerful work, Hazel O'Connor absolutely blew me away the first time I heard this. I only knew this music from the soundtrack, a gift from a Dutch friend when it was first released. Then, to see the music attached to dangerous, disturbed images in the movie was almost too much for one sitting. Through it all, however, is O'Connor's voice, raging against the straighjacket placed around us by society, industry and our blind obedience to technology at any cost.The amazing thing is this jarring, strident album has real lyrics, real melody, harmony. It is music - in a genre when those values are often ignored or rejected."
4,Old Version of CS2,"Based on using trial versions, this old version is only slightly below the later, and I cannot say about CS3 yet. CS2 is somewhat better than CS, which was itself a huge leap up from version 7. It is a burden to keep upgrading almost yearly, and I would recommend picking up any version of CS2 and planning to stick to it for a long while in that it does what almost everyone needs to do. Adobe will keep having newer versions of Photoshop and I wish they were not so pricey. I bought a trial version from an Amazon reseller which in itself is not that useful, but by telephone I was given the codes to register and validate it. No box came with it, nor book, but that is probably the most affordable way to get it."
4,ADOBE CS2,Product is difficult for the novice like myself. Booklet was included but I'm finding it difficult to understand.
5,Not necessary for amateurs,"Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!! And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep. This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale. There are less expensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements."
1,Avoid CS2 - stick with CS!,"If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support!"
1,Adobe Limpness,"Photoshop is a pretty powerful tool, but it is undermined by its own supremely crappy print drivers. One piddling window with maybe four controls and NO PRINT PREVIEW! No print preview for a piece of imaging software (at this late date) is perhaps the stupidest idea since the first caveman chewed on a tigers tail because he was hungry. Seriously, without a decent set of print drivers, you might as well try to alter your photos with a crayon and an iron. Idiocy. Unforgivable.Even Adobe's own Illustrator has a robust Print controls window."
1,This Book Exists to Make Sex Shameful,"This book was one of the most detrimental things to my spiritual health when I read it as a young teen. It taught me to be fearful and hold shame about sex which caused me great emotional suffering. Don't teach your children that their natural, normal feelings are wrong. Teach them how to appropriately process and deal with their feelings."
3,"Kelli - Ohio, USA","...We enjoyed the VCR for 13 months, and last week it decided to start eating tapes. I am not sure if buying a new VCR every 13 months is a good idea, but who really wants to spend [a ton of money]on a VCR when you can get a decent one for [very little] Also, I haven't noticed the VCR to be terribly noisy during rewind, but we buy good tapes. This VCR will definately be in consideration again if we don't figure out the problem with our current one."
1,Appear to be poorly manufactured,"I'm a regularly gigging musician and I've had several really handy folding music stands. These looked like a solid option and I ordered 4. The stands seem sturdy enough coming package, but I found them incredibly stiff and inflexible when I tried to open them, particularly the tripod base. For some reason it was nearly impossible to get the sleeve to slide down the base shaft so that the legs could be spread to an appropriate width. Sending the entire order back and looking for another product."
2,Low quality,"The mechanical assembly is very weak. After few months of normal use, the stand broke down. Don't count on using it for a few years."
3,"Amazon, does the case fit?","This item does what it is meant to do, but I still haven't figured out how to fold it up so it fits in the case."
2,review,It is very hard to set up for somebody that has never work with this type of product. It didn't bring instructions so you don't know which way it opens. I almost brake the top because you don't know which way it turns to open. It wasn't a pleasant experience to set up and very difficult. After it is set up it looks nice but because we twisted it in ways it wasn't suppose to open the top it looks twisted afterwards. I would recommend and easier stand or at least one that brings instructions. it shouldn't be this hard to set up for a music stand.
3,"Flimsy head, legs not very solid","I bought this tripod because it has independent legs. While it's got that going for it, it isn';t very stable. It has a lot of shake and the legs don't lock well.It's fairly compact, but not very light while adding to your backpack.The worst aspect is that the head can't handle the weight of my camera (Canon 40D)maybe if you are using a rebel with a kit lens, it would suffice. if I turn it sideways, it flops over completely."
1,Good for a Beginner,I ordered this tripod and when it came I was so disappointed that I sent it back immediately. The neoprene made my hands itch. It wasn't level when I put my camera on it. It angered me so much that I bought a carbon fiber tripod and magnesium head from the good people at Slik in the same hour. Although it was of poor quality for my use I would still say it would be good for someone who is just starting out in photography. I give it a low rating partly because I was being cheap and I should have went for the carbon fiber in the first place.
2,Didn't work,It didn't do anything for my dog or any of my foster dogs. It also gave me a headache after a sprayed it. It may work for some dogs just not mine.
4,Works most of the time,"This seems to work most of the time when my dog is upset or stressed because of noise or something, but it doesn't quite work when he is really shook up, like when fireworks go off. It's pretty hard to find anything that calms him down in that situation, but so far this product seems to work the best for most other situations."
2,Not for a frantic dog...,"My dog has pretty major separation anxiety and this didn't help at all. Maybe if you're dog has just a minor form of anxiety it might help, but it doesn't work if they're really frantic."
1,Monitor failed after only 2.5 years,"Expensive , but wonderful design, until the monitor goes out after 2.5 years, and it will cost $800 for a new one. Sony parts are out of this world in price, and most repair people say it will cost more that it's worth. It doesn't have any place to add another monitor to even check it out."
4,saved by the tea,"I believe the tea has helped with increasing my supply. I learned from another post, that the key is to drink plenty of fluids as well. I went from 8oz to 14.5 oz. I now have enough to breast feed and pump to build up my stash for when I return to work"
5,Works and tastes pleasant,This tea tastes so much better than the other brands and works better for me. If I have three or four bags a day I get impressive results in 24 hours (I pump at work).
4,Better than I remembered....,"I recently bought this CD again because I missed having certain songs on the album, but to my surprise I discovered that I really liked a lot more songs than I had before. I would say that this album contains a combination of the AWESOME 'Masquerade in Blood' mixed with the OK 'Get What You Deserve.' And even though 'Get What....' was just OK, don't fear, this album is a lot better!! Stand out tracks are ""Frozen Screams"", ""No Way Out"", ""Suicidal Justice"", ""Schwerter Zu Pflugscharen"", ""Sow the Seeds of Discord"", & ""Wander in the Valley."""
3,Signs of Life,"It's not their best work, but not their worst either. It's better than Feedback, Vapor Trails and 1/2 of Test For Echo. This album does restore my faith in Rush, and for the first time in 15 years I am actually looking forward to their next album. However, I am mystified by all the 5 star reviews-this is a 3 star effort at best. If you want a 5 star Rush album then listen to Moving Pictures. This album is good...not great, and yes, I do own every Rush studio album and do consider myself a fan. Rush fan before? Then yes, by all means pick up this album. If you're new to the band(chances are you're not even reading this review) then pick up any of their pre-Test For Echo material before this and if you like it, then maybe give this album a try."
1,BEWARE!!,"The MVI DVD will not play on some DVD-A players! It would not play on a few random DVD players I tried. It will not even play in the Acura TL 5.1 DVD-A players. About the only thing it would play on for me was my computer, which I don't have all the outboard gear to support the full experience."
4,Best in years,Really liked it. I felt there was an emotion through both the lyrics and music that's been missing for quite some time. Looking forward to seeing them on tour this year.
5,"WOW, it's pretty cool...","Rush continues to surprise, it's a musical slap-up meal (or whatever that means), i also liked the video inside the MVI, it's awesome...""We could be down and gone, but we hold on"""
3,I dont know,"Well, I think something is missing from this record but I dont know what. The sound is good, the musicians are great and the songs...well I dont know. You know, for me the perfect Rush album is the Roll The Bones, Counterparts and Test for Echo. Maybe the great songs missing from this album? I dont know....."
2,I'm DONE getting EXCITED about new RUSH releases...,"Yah, yah, I'm huge RUSH fan- all their cd's- got suckered into the $100 tickets to the last few tours, etc., etc.Let's face it- a lot of the fans love their new cd's which is fair and fine and a bunch just find the last few cd's ""phone-in's"". I'm not going to compare this to their moving pics periods, hemispheres, etc. (not fair) cause the band does evolve. But to what now? Just old rockers making cd's for their loyal fans. I like this a little better than Vapor Trails if that means anything. There's a few actually good tunes on here (the instrumentals- the monkey song is great) but it is already collecting dust on my cd shelf along Vapor Trails. There's Sooooo much more fun/better/relevant music out these days (and I'm not just talking rockers) that I buy a new Rush cd, listen to it for a week or so and then move on.... forever. Thank god for their back catalog!"
2,Feels cheap.,"Compared to other Hohner products, this harmonica felt cheap and leaky. I'm a intermediate player on diatonic harmonicas who wanted to try a chromatic. This one really turned me off..."
5,You GO Girl!,"This music, this movie, this Script is so awesome! An amazing portrayal of a struggle for stardom. Beyonce' is beyond beautiful and ""represents"" the icon ""supremely"" (sorry...had to go there!). The music is so well written, I love each and every track! Enough has been said about Jennifer Hudson, she has won her due, but ALL the actors did an amazing job."
5,"Addicting, Creative, Fun.","I purchased this and have it on my desk to play with when my computer is super slow. This is very, very addicting. People often stop by to play with the supermags.I wanted to play with this instead of working. The pieces are super tough, the log pieces can be stepped on, dropped, put under heavy books and they don't crack.Be careful using this around computers and other objects. They are strong and will literally fly out of your hand if there is something metal nearby. I recommend keeping the pieces in the Styrofoam container in which they came - the top can be turned over and used as a play table so not to lose the pieces.I plan on getting several more sets for home as well as an additional set for my desk."
4,"4 stars for music, 1 for vinyl pressing","Look, I'm no audiophile but there is something wrong with Yeprocs vinyl pressing of this album. I have heard two different copies and on both of them the fidelity gets worse and worse as the record progresses. Everybody knows that the first track on an album sounds better than the ones on the inside but I have never heard such a noticeable difference as this.I think this is a case where I would buy the cd instead or seek out an original pressing of the vinyl."
4,Haven't heard this yet but...,"I haven't bought the album yet, but I just saw her in Chicago and I think she's amazing. I think the hoarsesness, that the previous reviewer notes, of her voice is actually jazzy/rock and roll sneaking into the African vibe of her music. She reminds me of an African Kate Bush in some songs...very emotional, real and the melodies veer off into surprising directions. And if you see her live, her dancing is beautiful and the live harmonies are divine."
1,Fouls up MAF in 5vz-fe,"Threw it in, gave me a check engine light for P0171 within 600 miles. Took the filter out cleaned the maf and put OEM filter back in, 15000 miles with no problem. I then re-cleaned the maf and Threw the K&N fitler back in and within 50 miles, the same Check Engine code came back. The one I received came WAY WAY WAY over oiled. My maf is gummed up again. Be careful with all the hype."
2,Need to reconsider if I want to continue using this filter,"this is not an optimized design for Lexus GX470.It is extremely tight and difficult to fit properly.i question if this is an ""after-thought"" for the LeXus or not...did not noticed any improvement on the gas efficiency...given the cost of this filter, it's probably more of an ""ego"" purchase rather than a ""practical"" component for my SUV"
4,EXODUS FROM OBESITY,"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT . I READ BEFORE MY SURGRY AND THEN AGAIN AFTER. IT ANSWERS MANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER SURGRY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE ABOUT TO ADVENTURE ON THIS NEW WAY OF LIVING.MALHALO,VICKI BARDOS"
4,Exodus from Obesity,"I feel it would be a great help for those who like me have been ""fat"" most of their lives. They have come to accept the hurts when people call them ""the fat ones' to peel back all the abuses and get to the core as to why we are having the ""weight' problem is a great asset. You know once we loose our safety fat we are vunerable to compliments and good wishes. But it is inside our heads and hearts where we need despertly to accept our selves be it 'fat, skinny, ugly, plain, dumb or stupid, we are all human beings worth 1 'one' unit. No more no less. From the Pope, president to the beggrman on the street 1 'one' unit if we see ourselves through these new eyes we will make it. This book helps us on our way, clears up all the bad messages we have heard and puts us on the road to sucess, healthfully and happy."
5,Slidin' & Groovin',"This has always been my favorite T Rex album since I first purchased the vinyl back in the early 70's as a young teen.Compared to ""The Electric Warrior"" which is more straight ahead glam-rock; this album could be considered ""groovin-glam"" rock. A few more acoustic guitars are thrown in the mix for a wonderful ""laid back"" effect (affect?).There are great rockers here like ""Buick Mackane"" & ""The Slider"".Very few records are timeless and can stand up against the passage or the clock, this is one of them. It is as fresh now as the day I bought the vinyl for my Garard turntable.If you plan on purchasing this disc and do not have ""Electic Warrior"" you MUST purchase both.Then your all set for hours of enjoyment."
2,A Blatant Commercial for the HepaPro Corporation,"If you are impressed by the fact that this protocal is recommeded by Andrew Weil, go read about him some. This protocal may work, but there is no evidence for it. The author presents a book full of statements, unverified case studies, and an unsupported study alleging 75 individuals with no FDA or governmental association for the study. The herbal regimen recommended, using the supplies from the recommended HepaPro corporation costs about [money] per month including discounts, less shipping. After about a year of this, if your Hep C LFTs are normalized, the maintenance regimen is about [money] per month - forever."
3,Not able to use it,"Maybe I should've caught on that it was a HP product, it would not work with my mac. Due to that fact I don't know how it really comes out once installed."
4,I like it.,I like it because it stays on all day and the smell is not overpowering. I will most likely buy another one once this one is all gone.
2,Panasonic?? What a disapointment,"I always heard how Panasonic made such fine VCRs. While this may have been true in the past, I believe that Panasonic is slipping. Which is all this VCR gave from the time I got it - a ""slipping"" picture. Every tape I tried would miss-track, or the picture would flutter & roll, or loud mistracking noises would happen every few minutes. Didn't matter if it was an old tape, freshly opened tape, newly purchased movie, every one miss-tracked or the picture would roll, etc. Despite ""autotracking"" feature, I constantly had to manually track the machine, especially after fast-forwarding through a commercial. My previous Panasonic worked very well for two years, and then did the very same thing, despite my taking good care of it. Which is all a shame, because this Panasonic VCR is one of the few available with an S-video output, which would have meant a superior picture-if only it didn't slip, slide & roll."
4,great rack!,"no comment. just amazingg! i'm a student, and I use a section for each subject and everything's just well organized!"
1,The Buttons Break,"I purchased one of these mice soon after they were released, and was somewhat happy with it for about 5 months, then the primary button stopped working. Kensington sent me a replacement, and now, three months later, the primary button on that one is broken too. I'm still waiting for a second replacement since they are out of stock.Ergonomically, this mouse is terrible. It's impossible to pick it up while holding one of the buttons due to the flat edge all around on the bottom (as opposed to curved like apple's and most other mice). If you have large hands, find a different mouse. This one is designed for women or small-handed men, and provides no support for the palm of your hand."
2,De la difficulté de faire une image (a review in french),"""Hélas pour moi"" est un mauvais film, Godard lui-mme le reconnat. Mais enfin, comment le critiquer, avoir les mots face à lui et face aux autres, qui éjaculent à son simple nom. Peut-tre juste une image, une voix et une posture. Celle du Dieu godardien, qui rappelle les faux dieux du film et de la série ""Stargate"": cette mme faon de parler, d'avoir un cancer de la gorge. Alors que dire, comment tre constructif: comparer, encore et toujours, se dire surtout que Godard n'a pas fait que des bons films, qu'il a mme fait quelques navets -sans doute une foi déclinante dans le cinéma, quand le sujet est moins bon. Conclusion: un des meilleurs critiques franais, Louis Skorecki, a écrit à propos de ""Je vous salue Marie"", que la vierge de Godard n'était pas assez vierge, pas assez juive. C'est exactement la situation du Dieu de ""Hélas pour moi"": pas assez juif et trop allemand."
1,Awareness: The Perils and Opportunities of Reality,I receive that Item and was very disappointed. The corner of the book was bending without repair. Book was packed correctly and USPS was not at fault.
5,Awarenss IS the ANSWER,"Having read approximately 60 gazillion spiritual books I was amazed that one could still blow me away. So succint, clear, to the point, hardhitting, Truth by the ton. Eloquent, enlightening and easy to understand. Numerous quotes and stories that I have not read anywhere else. What a treasure!"
5,"This book will really make you think about ""Waking up!""","Read this book over and over again! Memorize it, live it, then pass it on or buy it for someone you love! They'll thank you."
5,very good!!,"Tired of your self???????? Read this and get harshly jolted awake, you will never be the same(thank goodness)"
3,too much...,"Very interesting account of the Taranto raid, a forgotten yet important event in WW II. Despite the fact that the books reads easily, it shoudl have been half as long. The buildup to the raid is indispensible, but a bit overdone in detail. It could have been slightly less rich in detail. But what is really overdone is the aftermath. This takes half of the book, in which the general course of events in the Mediterranean is described, as well as later engagements in which Swordfishes were involved, and a comparision with Pearl Harbour is made. To top it of, a general analysis of carrier development. I was a bit suprised to see the F4 Panthom appear in the last chapter of a book dealing with the Raid on Taranto. The writer should have made some basic choices here. Nevertheless, even though the story runs wild, it still makes easy and entertaining reading. And the charm of a story about biplanes taking on a much more modern fleet is too strong not to recommended this book."
5,Two classic make out albums on one CD!!!,"These are two of the alluring Miss London's finest sessions, the first has a song for each month of the year the second Lp is arranged by Mr. Mood Music himself, Andre Previn, highlightd by a spectacular version of Makin Whopee, maybe a little overoe=rchestrarted but still very lush and nice for those late hours. Recommended!!!"
3,Only in boxing could a name like that be considered tough.,"Ok, so I saw the preview for the movie with the same name. I'm not quite sure what to think about this. I can tell this is no ROCKY right off the bat. Really, come on. This is a book based off of a true story, that they are NOW making into a movie. So...why didn't we just leave it at ROCKY. He had all those things, did it WAY before, and had a cool name.They are lucky I SAW the preview. If I had heard about it, well... I just don't know what I would think. As I said before, only in boxing could a name like ""Cinderella Man"" be considered tough. Later.howardtuttleman.com"
1,Predictable & Boring,This was one of those movies that never exactly held my attention. I figured out the plot way ahead of time because it reminds me of the movie Preacher's Kid but with less singing and not as much of a plot. Waste of time!
2,This is not a comedy but a Dark comedy,Don't be fooled by the title because this is a dark comedy about a psychotic ice cream man that kills and puts body parts in his ice cream and sells it to neighborhood kids.Clint Howard gives a creepy performance as the ice cream man and the movie is sometimes funny like the scene where a cop is eating the ice cream and there's a eyeball in it and the other scene where Howard puts two cops heads on ice cream cones and searches for the kids and pretends there puppets.The movie is a low budget B-movie with bloody special effects and bad acting.Not bad or good just average.Worth the rental but not to buy.
2,Terrible picture quality on recordings,"This VCR has many wonderful bells and whistles, like commercial advance, many indexing searches and great displays. BUT the recordings are terrible. I had to return this VCR. It is also noisy which you don't notice if it is in a glassed cabinet. the remote is easy to learn but the buttons are unbelievably tiny."
4,It's what they don't tell you that counts in VCRs,"I studied ratings and descriptions carefully before selecting this model; so thought I was getting something that would give me a lot of control--but didn't realize that many of the features for which I selected it don't work with my cable connection:VCR+ is incompatible; in order to be able to record off the air, I had to have someone come up from the cable company to program it in a way that was not described in the manual, which I did read very carefully.It does play very well when I use a readymade videotape--but I wanted more than that."
2,"extras great, core features poor","I purchased this VCR as a primary unit in a home theater setup. Setup was smooth, especially the auto clock and auto channel setup.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Moview Advance feature actually worked. It's designed to skip the movie previews that are at the beginning of most commerical tapes. I tested this feature on a variety of tapes, and it worked as advertised. A great feature for those of us who's kids are exposed to enough advertising as it is.However, extras aside, I found the playback quality extremely poor. There were visible lines and ""waves"" that appeared on commerical tapes as well as tapes that the unit recorded itself. Adjusting the tracking did not help.I really wanted to like this VCR but it's going back."
2,Disappointing,"Bought a 'scratch & dent' unit from Crutchfield (great company), but I had to send it back. Playback quality of recorded tapes was sub-standard. I really wanted the Commercial Advance feature and it worked correctly about 60% of the time. The biggest pain was trying to use fast forward to get thru a commercial without continually overshooting. Its too fast! (my old Admiral is two speed and much easier to control). The programming interface is also archaic! Having to use the up/dn keys to set the channel, time, and date is ridiculous. It blows my mind that we've advanced so far with all these features yet their implementation is two steps back from what we had in the past."
2,Pick another. 1001 nights better.,"I like such compos by these guys as ""1001 nights"", ""Not the last goodbye"". These are truly original, rhytmical&uplifting. On this CD only 2 covers - Wild World and Nature Boy - really deserve attention. Wild World show S&S's best, it's the best track. But other tracks feature somewhat dull&unoriginal _usual_ guitar play. 1001 nights sounded better."
2,there isn't enough info,you don't tell what size the planner is like a classic nor do you tell if it's ring bound or wire and if it's a ring bound you don't tell how big the rings are such as 1.25 or 1.50
1,Buyer Beware: JUNK!,This dollhouse is junk! We got it for our 2 year old for Christmas. When we put it together on Christmas Eve some of the wood pieces fell apart (they were only glued together) and we could only do 2 floors. Since then I've had to continuously glue the thing back together just so it would stay up. I finally had enough of it and told my daughter that Santa had to take it back and would bring her a new one. It's going in the trash tomorrow.
5,"A great book, except for one thing....","This is truly a terrific book if you want to learn more about what capitalism really is. I truly believe that capitalism is the most perfect form of government, and Ayn Rand does a great job of explaining and comparing capitalism to other forms of governments. However, I do believe in God, and how I wish that Ayn Rand would have included the virtues of God within her views on capitalism."
2,Capitalism is wrong,"Capitalism has a number of failings but perhaps the most basic oneis its theory of values. Capitalism acts as if there is a commoncurrency with which we can measure all that is valuable (money).This value monism is incorrect. See ""The non-existence of a utilityfunction and the structure of non-representable preference relations""(Beardon, et al, J. of Math. Econ., vol. 37, pg 17-38, 2002) and refs.therein. Capitalists simply get the math wrong. Money isn't everything.Value pluralism is the correct axiology. There are things of valuethat can not be bought and sold (thank god! like love and votes).This failure of values within capitalism is why it is ultimately evil.Rand is an apologist for evil, a tragic figure."
1,Beating the people with the people's stick,"Are you people insane? The first person who wins a footrace to an oasis in the desert does not have the ""moral right"" to keep it for himself. What any rational people would do is divide the water equally, with extra shares to anyone who is dangerously dehydrated. It is not ""force"" or ""coercion"" or any such hoo-ha to say ""Hell with you. I'm taking my share of the water whether you like it or not."""
2,too complicated,"i haven't read the book itself, but i have read excerpts in a book on different people in history, and tarn's writings are extremely complicated."
3,A decent try ruined by bad writing,"The concept is interesting enough. The characters could be engaging. But ultimately this novel falls flat. The dialog is very poorly written. And while science fiction writers can certainly assume a number of improbable things it is best to be parsimonious. The author dishes them out in medium-large expository lumps.On the whole, it was a bit too much like watching a remake of ""The Thing"" set in Pittsburgh."
5,Surprised me!,"The premise of this book sounded cheesy to me, but one of my friends bought it anyway and insisted that I read it. I'm so glad he did! The prose is beautiful, and the plot kept me hooked so that I read it in a few hours. I've read a lot of new SF authors in the last several years, but Wen Spencer beats them all. I'm so glad to have discovered her early on!"
3,security education,Nice book for general understanding of security printing. A little light on the types of substrates that can be used or created.
2,so far from the original storyline,"i was tutoring a high school freshman this past summer in reading ""lord of the flies."" i wanted to find a video that would be a good visual to enhance his comprehension. after viewing this 1990 version, i almost returned it. this movie is so far off the actual plot. the kids are shown to be caring for a wounded adult at the beginning of the movie; there are NO adults on the island in the book. so the plot is a bit distorted for this version. plus there is alot of unnecessary bad language used throughout the movie. i ended up keeping it for myself, and ordered my student the 1960 version, which is 99% accurate and a much better depiction of what the book entails."
4,Easy access film,"I'm not a great reader. Sure, I lap up the pulp fiction and the occasional classic, but I rarely get a chance to read so more often than not my reading comprises of cheap novels or magazines. The result of this is that I've never read the book to this film, so I can't compare the two.However, this doesn't mean I can't enjoy the film! It has inspired me to (eventually) get round to reading the book (perhaps after the millenium bug wipes out all electronic forms of entertainment).The plot is a basic premise - what would happen to a group of children if stranded? The story unravels as factions emerge, prejudices raise their head, and the entire feel is of an apocolyptic world on the brink. The story heats up to the final conflict, where we are suddenly reminded that these are just children and they are not in control by their sudden rescue. It can be taken to be both a reminder of their youth, but a more scary reminder of how close we are to the edge as a society."
2,Modern Version of a Classic Misses the Point,"If you are looking for a recreation of one of the best modern classic novels, don't watch this video. This 1990s version is senselessly more violent and not as critical of our society. The characters are also much more shallow. However, if you can forget the book for 90 minutes, the story is entertaining and the setting is vivid."
4,I'm glad I was never trapped on an island w/ these kids...,"This was a very good movie that came from an even better book. When I was younger I didn't understand people who would claim that the books were better than movies. Now, I do. However, I feel that for this statement to be true, one must have a vivid imagination and be able to immerse themselves in the world that the author created.Anyway, I loved the book and I thought the movie was well done too. The kids are pretty good at acting. Almost too good, as if they were actually dropped off on an island and told that they had to figure out a way to survive. I would recommend watching this movie w/o children because I think it may be a bit much."
2,Are you sure it flowers?,Bought as a gift for husband who wanted a miniature orchid for his bottle garden - is is not in garden yet as it still has not flowered. Better or some instruction would have been nice.
5,Great to improve your writing,"Writing is easy--you just put down the words. Editing/revising is the tough part, yet the most important. Lanham uses a very easy to read style and easy to implement suggestions that help you make your writing better. One of the most helpful writing books I own."
5,Best Writing Reference Book For Kids,I had this book when I was little girl and I remember asking my teacher if I could have it. I knew then how great it was. So here I am 14 years later about to purchase it for my little girl!! The illustrations and explanations are flawless and easy to read and understand.
5,Excellent Resource Book!,This book was recommended by a High School English teacher. It is an excellent resource for High School students. I highly recommend it!
3,Avoid the paperback - spend a little more for the hardback,"As an English and Special Education teacher I've found the Writers Inc. books to be a very helpful reference book for my students. However, the hardback versions are better organized and easier to find information than the softback. So, spend the few extra dollars...to get the better book."
1,Rusted within 12 hours,"I actually bought this for half the price at the Container Store. However, I washed them and I wasn't able to get the soapy water out from the side of the plastic lid, so had to let them air dry over night. When I woke up the next morning the edge of the tin had already rusted. I took it back to the store for a full refund. I would not buy this product."
1,Terrible.,This book makes no sense. It is overwhelmingly confusing. Simple problems are made much harder than they should ever be for no reason. Save your money.
4,Tired of the Crap Hop out Now,"Arrested Development (not that cheezy show on Fox), but the original Hip Hop troop hits some great alternative/classic/different music in this great CD. Some positive, inspiring, great music. Good stuff. Check it out. I downloaded it (great for some out of print or hard to find music)."
2,The DVD was Damaged and didn't play right,"I love the movie, thats why I bought it as a gift for my Mom. But she tried to play it and it kept stopping. I was told the item was NEW....but now wonder if it wasn't"
5,Very Refreshing musical,"I live in a condo and we run a free movie every week and everyone loved this one. It's not the run of the mill Musical-Comedy there is something for everyone. After the movie each week we have a little chat session and everyone was so hyped up by the movie, after an hour and a half we had to send them home."
5,customer service,"Speakers sounded clear with deep bass.Blew tweeter before first year was up ,have a relativly high powered system (within rec specs).After placing order 4 months ago I am still waiting for part from jbl.Owned several types of jbl's including L100Ts and s -412's and loved them all.FOLLOW UP-for do it your selfers when ordering a replacement part from jbl a copy of the reciept is needed.after misunderstanding on my part cleared up customer service was outstanding."
2,not very helpful,"My 12 year old son has ADD. I work with him frequently on organization. I did like the checklists, but on the whole I found the book to be condesending. I feel that they were projecting feelings onto the child reader, making assumptions on when they were getting tired or feeling overwhelmed. I would have prefered a more factual, logical approach, as children with ADD need the bottom line."
1,Stale,"I have used this product for years, buying it from different health food stores as well as online. I was very surprised and disappointed with purchase. Although the expiration date was in 2014 the vitamins smelled awful and had to be thrown out."
1,"TCM to the Rescue: Widescreen ""Gator""","Gator fans, forget the long-overdue-but-mightily-disappointing DVD. Lucky cable subscribers need to look no further than Turner Classic Movies (TCM) for a 2.35:1 presentation of Gator (the ENTIRE film, not just the opening/closing credits a la the DVD). Plus, as anyone who watches knows, TCM also means uncut and commerical-free. I was fortunate enough to catch a 4:30am TCM-premiere of Gator on Thursday 9/23/04. Unfortunately, the film began ten minutes later than advertised so, of course, my VCR timer shut off with still several minutes to go. Oh well. No choice but to keep an eye out for the next airing which, unfortunately, won't be for at least another two months (if then, even). Still, give me a widescreeen VHS over a full-frame DVD any day---of any film."

The book has good balance between subject matter and theory which makes it unique.However this book has many serious drawbacks. Had there been excellent books on this subject I would have discouraged you to have this one. Rather my advice would be referring to the book ""Approximate Dynamic Programming"" by ""Warren B.

2,Shlock Horror!!!!!,"In the town of Snowfield, Colarado, hundreds of people have disappeared, or are left horribly dead. The 5 remaining residents must find out who or what is responsible as they face danger of an ancient enemy of horrific proportions to try and remain alive.You would think a movie starring Ben Affleck, Rose McGowan, Live Schreiber and Peter O' Toole would be pretty good. Wrong!!! The movie is a sub-par mediocre horror story I doubt does Dean Koontz novel, that it is adapted from, justice. Character development is very poor, with little told about each character other than that which the plot relied on. On a plus though - the special effects are of a high value and there are quite a few (maybe 2) nice, scary scenes. Recommended for horror aficionados only."
2,Barely passable time waster.,"This film could have and should have been much better. It starts off like gangbusters! Two sisters arrive in a town that appears to be completely deserted. From there, the film takes a rocket-paced nosedive into sheer and utter boredom. NOTHING HAPPENS, at least nothing worth reporting. The talents of Ben Affleck and Peter O'Toole are wasted, and would have benefited more from a script that actually gave their characters something to do. There is, however, a monster that's worth your attention. If you must watch, fast-forward to the end to catch a quick glimpse of it. Besides that, you'll actually be a lot better off reading the book this mess was based upon."
2,A blah movie,"After watching ""Still Breathing"" and becoming an instant fan of the luminously beautiful Joanna Going, I went out and bought a used copy of ""Phatoms."" I paid eight dollars for this movie---and I wish I had found it cheaper elsewhere.This movie is mediocre. My friend and I talked throughout the whole film, making fun of everything. But for some reason, I guess because this movie is so cheeseball, it scared us more than all of the ""Scream"" movies put together. Low expectations can work wonders.Ben Affleck couldn't save this movie. We wanted Rose McGowan's character to die. And as for Ms. Going, she was wasted here. Somehow, they managed to make her look very sickly and plain.So... watch this at your own risk."
2,O'Toole and McGowan are the only good things in it.,"I read the book before I saw the movie...and the book stank, and I wondered why they chose to make a movie of it. I saw the movie anyway, being a Peter O'Toole fan, and it wasn't much better than the book. It was the first time I've seen McGowan, and she has presence on the screen, and O'Toole's probably the most charismatic actor in history, so he is always worth watching...but when the camera was off them, you had to deal with what is basically a schlock B-horror-movie. If you're in the mood for cheap thrills, and nothing wrong with that, this should satisfy, otherwise see ""Alien"" again instead."
4,One of the few films that REALLY scares me.,"""Phantoms"" does have its moments and I was not very disappointed - even though I had reads the book. The acting is good, the plot is pretty good... It's not great - but it's something that can be very entertaining. Not bad at all."
2,The men who failed to un-earth ( the meaning of the novel),"nicholas roeg ( director )and whoever the screenplay ""writer"" was blew this one. they turned one of the greatest novel of our time into a jumbled. dis-jointed, inaccurate and ultimatelydissapointing montage of confusing images and annoying sounds.i can only hope a director and screenwriter who actually READthis book and passed a test proving that they understood it willattempt to get this one right sometime soon."
2,This was a huge disappointment...,"Some nice cinematography and a plot lifted from a classic sci-fi novel by Walter Tevis can't add much to this perverse and incomprehensible drama. I usually agree with Leonard Maltin, but he must have been watching a different movie. This isn't thought-provoking, it is nothing more than a bunch of trashy sex scenes loaded with nudity and rape. I can't understand one plot turn and trashy ex-rock star David Bowie looks like a dirty freak here (but maybe he is supposed to). Movie isn't deprived of some interest, but I wouldn't recommend it. Why not watch the TV movie ""V"" for some inventive and watchable sci-fi. I was incredibly disappointed with this movie, and I will be sure to inform the store that I bought it from as soon as I return it. What a letdown."
4,A story with only one true ending,"This film, as reviewed by many, is about a alien who comes to earth in an effort to find water for his drought ridden planet. However, it appears to me that the movie is not about a space traveler, but rather a time traveler from earth's future. The reasons which support this is that first; Bowie's character suffers from time shifts like when his limo is seen traveling down a country road in the past when such vehicles did not exist. Two; he was prone to motion sickness, like when he had a nose bleed from riding the elevator. The movie I found to be intriging. But he was not an alien, but a human from earth's future!"
1,Do not purchase this DVD,"I read the book that this movie is based on a long time ago and I thought that I would enjoy the movie. So, without having seen it before, I bought the DVD. What a total waste... To put it another way, I have purchased 140+ DVDs and I consider this movie to be the worst. Specifically, this movie is too long and David Bowie's character (the main character) is just too wierd."
2,bowie phone home...,"If you're a huge David Bowie fan then you might like this flick- just to see him (and I mean all of him) in 1976, with great hair, and those magnetic eyes. Other than that, this sci-fi self proclaimed ""cult classic"" will bore you to tears like Carson Daly's absent personality. (I swear hes an MTV created robot.) This movie was so choppy and dragged out, with a bummer of an ending, that I briefly hated David Bowie. Briefly."
3,OH NO...,"WHY? I DON;T THINK CRITERION BLU-RAY HAS GOT A MUCH BETTER VIDEO THAN THEIR DVD EDITION, AND WHY...? DOES A NOVEL COST TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO PUT IT TOGETHER IN THE PACKAGE?"

5,Quintessential Swamp Boogie,"Lightning Slim's sound is somewhat derivative of Howling Wolf although he is his own man. It is real Louisiana Swamp music with a rawness that is refreshing. Slim had some regional jukebox hits in the early and mid-60s in the lowland South all the way above Memphis, which is where and when I first heard him, dancing to such gems as ""Long Leany Mama"". This album is a great example of Slim's work with engaging harmonica riffs (Lazy Lester?) backing up his vocals. If you like electric blues, you will enjoy this distinctive style and Slim's unique voice. It was real kick-and-stab-juke-joint music in its day. You can feel its power."
2,Simple Read,"This was a very simple read, almost too simple. I was looking for a more in-depth read and this wasn't it. The info I read in this book may be helpful to those who are learning this stuff for the first time but for those of you looking to expand on information you already have, I would pass on this book. It is very sophomoric in writing and in illustration too."
3,First Novel For Sure,"Since first novels only introduce us to the writing abilities of their authors, it is no surprise that this novel propelled Sparks onto a prolific writing career, with much better novels.The Notebook will tear at your heart strings, despite its slow pace and failure to touch upon the events that shaped the characters...these teens appear to have never grown up, even though Noah was shipped off to war. Such harrowing experiences should have hardened his character, but there is no evidence of that in his reunion with Allie, which disappointed this reader, since it is unrealistic that the experience had no bearing on his future character or his relations with others.Though it is a first novel with many trite plot lines, I will recommend it for those seeking romance and happy endings."
3,"DON'T ORDER FROM ""MOTOR CITY BOOKS""","I can't review this book because I never recieved it. Please be advised - DON'T ORDER FROM ""MOTOR CITY BOOKS"". I never recieved the book and they don't respond to my e-mails. First time this has happened to me on Amazon."
1,Why don't they offer 0 stars as a rating?,"Want to be a writer, but think you have no talent? Read Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook. It will inspire you to pick up a pencil and write a new bestseller. That this sappy, predictable, pathetic attempt at writing became a bestseller speaks volumes about the American reading public. High school students can out-write this man. Save your money. Don't even get it at the library, life is too short."
5,The Notebook,"It was so much better than the movie, the details were wonderful. When you read this book its almost impossible to put it down. One of the best ever."
4,A Story to Dream About,"A heartwarming story guaranteed to tug at heartstrings. I believe that true love is a decision and not just pure emotion as it lasts through periods when the embers of romance and passion has burned out. Still, it is touching to see a couple's love and romance not only surviving but thriving after so many years. Truly gives a new dimension to the subject of love. It makes me truly wonder in the power of love to change impossible situations. 4 stars for the story, 5 hankies."
5,Lovely story,Just had to read it again after seeing the movie over the holiday. This book is by far one of his best. I always wished it was longer but what's there must suffice.
5,"A very romantic, heart-wrenching love story!","I absolutely fell in love with The Notebook. It is a beautiful story about a couple destined and meant to be together, and how they overcome the obstacles in the way of their being together. READ IT!!!"
4,Great for anyone with or searching for a soul-mate.,"What a joy to have found this book. It is great for anyone who has found their soul-mate or anyone who is still searching for one. I loved the book, the author was so sensitive, very nicely done.Thank you."
4,I loved it from beginning to end.,"This story can help a person understand the affliction of such a disease as alzheimers. The true love between the main characters is something beyond what many people find in todays world. While reading I had to keep a box of tissues near due to the fact that not only was I sad at times, but at times I was so happy I cried."
2,A Bridges of Madison County Rip Off,The book was written to draw the audience into emotions rather than telling the story. There were too many cliches to the story.The story reminded me of Bridges of Madison County. It was marketed quite well. Whoever did this deserved much of the credit.
4,"I cried, but it was a little too unrealistic","It was good and I even cried towards the end. But, it was a little unrealistic and predictable. It's a very good light read though and that's what I was in the mood for. Definitely recommend to my sensitive, romantic friends."
2,"Ah, young love!","A bodice-ripper sans ripped bodices (ha, she unbuttons *his* shirt). Personally, I'd have thought she'd opt for a shower before going back to meet Lon. No wonder he disappeared. In short, about as plausible as Love Story, and serves the same purpose: makes the ladies sigh and look askance at the guy snoring next to 'em.Stick with ""How We Met"" in Ann Landers. At least they're real."
1,Secrets revealed by the notebook effect elderly woman's life,"Another disappointing attempt at creating a moving romance. The author equates love with tragedy. True, all life ends in death, but he dwells on the negative rather than the positive. The book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride and then drops them off the cliff into oblivion. Don't bother with this book or you'll need prosac to face the day."
2,Not what I expected,"Maybe I made a mistake but watching the movie 1st. I kept waiting and waiting to get into the book, but never did. The end just seemed wrong."
1,I want my four hours back,"A recipe for The Notebook.Take two bland, perfect leads. Make them fall into a young syrupy love. Throw in a touch of class separation in the South. Age them enough to be world weary and to have accumulated another obstacle to their love. Overcome obstacle. Get old and forgetful. End the book with geriatric sex.Induce vomiting.[...]"
1,An insult,"Cliche plot, cliche sentences, unoriginal, unmoving: John Locke was correct when he said that in a capitalistic society mediocrity would rule, would rise to the top, but he NEVER prepared us for this!!!where is the Salinger of our time???!!!"
1,If this is the best book you ever read-get a library card!,"I can't even believe this book was published, never mind that people thought it was great! They obviously have not read truly great books. It read like a freshman's attempt at a novel, only worse."
1,The Only Book I Ever Threw Across A Room,"Ugh. This book is the most sappy, predictable, and unreadable I've ever encountered. I read all the others recommended by Amazon under the ""Customers who bought this also bought..."" and they are all far better than this one. A Harlequin romance for the geriatric set."
1,Nauseating,"I'm starting to wonder why I belong to my book club, considering that I've been subjected to books like this one. This book was long on detail, short on plot. It's the kind of witless book you can read while supervising the kids swimming during the summer; your full attention is not necessary to grasp the ""plot"". This book reads like a made for television movie...that you decide from the advertisements not to watch. I did learn one thing though: even if you write a really bad book, someone somewhere is bound to publish it. Save yourself from the nausea and spend your money on another book, just about any other is more worthy."
2,A sappy and predictable story,"I expected this book to be engaging, but what I found was 2-dimensional characters and predictable outcomes. This book reminded me of a Harlequin romance. Save your money!"
3,Not as good as A Walk To Remember,"My favorite book still remains ""A Walk To Remember"" but that doesn't mean that ""The Notebook"" isn't a good book. It sure has its moments and really tunes you into the book. It's a good story but it didn't really captivate me as much as ""A walk to remember"" did. It starts off a bit dull and then gets really interesting and ends dull. The end was also a bit strange and weird. If you're in a situation where you don't know whether to buy ""a walk to remember"" or ""the notebook,"" pick ""a walk."" There is a movie already completed for the book that will star Mandy Moore. But all in all, an okay book."
5,Wonderfully touching,"This love story definitely brought me to tears. After spending 1 1/2 years of reading self help, new age books, this was a nice diversion. You couldn't help but love Noah. He was strong, soft, and everything in between. His devotion and love for his wife was beautiful. The tragedy in their life was incomprehensible. This book was well written. I enjoyed reading it."
5,I cried ...,what a lovely story ... I stayed up reading the book from start to finish all in one sitting ... it is hopelessly romantic.
3,Pretty Good,"I bought The Notebook after seeing the preview for the upcoming movie based on the novel. I was kind of dissapointed in the book because I expected something much different.I would've like if Nicholas Sparks go into Allie and Noah's relationship before the ""reunion"" instead of going straight to it.Other than this flaw (in my opinion), I found the book fairly entertaining. It was really touching how Noah read the Notebook to Allie everyday when Allie developed Alzheimer's. But I found the end... well... disturbing and kind of gross.I still plan on seeing the movie and I hope it will be a better representation of this love story than the book."
1,blechh!,"This is mass marketing at its best and fiction at its very, very worst. If you want true love & romance, try reading Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights or O Pioneers. The writing is laughable, though Mr. Sparks looks good on the jacket photo :)"
2,Stick with the Movie,"I watched the movie several times before reading the book. I didn't care much for the book. They were like 2 different stories. Not sure why the story line was changed soo much. I loved the story of Noah and Allie when they were young, falling in love the way the movie portrayed it. The book just tells you that they were in love. Stick with the movie version.5 stars to the movie2 stars to the book"
3,How do I knw he received it?,The book was sent already but he hasnt received it yet... :/ if he doesnt receive it who do I inform that too????
3,Too common and repetitive,"This story was very common, I felt like I had read it before when it was only my first time. I'd heard it praised so much that I finally decided to read it. Although it was a good story I was really hoping for more."
5,Both the Book and Movie were well-made...the Book even better,"""The Notebook"" was Nicholas Sparks breakthrough novel. It has gained popularity because it appeals to every age group- the young at heart to the experienced at heart. Not many contemporary love novel have their own Cliff Notes. This one does.Both the story and prose flow well and smoothly. You can feel that you are in the deep South at different time periods as your journey through the emotional highs and lows of the main characters.As a story, there is the spontaneous love and passion of youth. Then, there is the bonding and eventual longetivity of the relationship. And, there is the enduring love and loyalty that can only come with trials and time.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons From a Mother"""
2,Lots of mush & gush,"I found the story engaging, but not very believable. These 2 people are portrayed as too ""perfect."" Maybe I'm cynical, but I got tired of all the ""mush & gush."" He was perfect, she was perfect, their children were perfect, their home was perfect, their lifestyle was perfect, their faces & bodies were perfect, their relationship was perfect... Whew! Give me a break. I closed the book dazed & confused. It seemed like the story just stopped. It didn't end. I've concluded that the narrator died at that moment, but that's not so according to my friends. My book club is in a heated debate over this. This debate has been the most interesting part of reading this book... wondering what on earth Nicholas Sparks is describing there at the end - death or new life? I reread it several times looking for the answer, but I'm still at a loss. Perhaps THAT is what Sparks intended? To keep us guessing & wondering & drawing our own conclusions???"
1,"A terrible, maudlin book","I think I picked out the book because I liked the cover and I liked the Bridges of Madison County. I read it one night when I couldn't sleep and realized in the middle that I must be reading something equivalent to a Harlequin romance. (I've never read a Harlequin romance, so I don't know.) I had to skim over a great deal of it because the writing was so bad. The mother's actions were unbelievable; ""true love"" at age 15 is very rare; and the Alzheimer's situation was unrealistic. I couldn't believe the fiance would have submitted without a fight, since he was such a control freak. The writing was too simplistic, trite, and maudlin. I felt cheated out of the money I spent to buy the book. I wish I could give it no stars."
1,Sappy Wishful Unrealism,"I love romances. I really do. But this one is really abysmal. The movie is reasonable, but the book is intolerable. If I have to hear the sentence ""She was beautiful"" just one more time, I'm going punch Nicholas Sparks in the kneecaps. This book is very much a good indication of why Sparks was unknown for so long. The movie works. The book definitely doesn't."
1,Poor excuse for a best-seller,"Are you an avid reader? Then really, don't waste your time on this one. It will only take a few hours, but you may as well be picking your nose because this is really disappointing. I am all for a sad love story, but this is a sappy, poorly written novel. It might have been easier to read with fewer grammatical errors and some sort of writing style. I can not believe that this was a best-seller."
3,Reality in this book deals with the suffering of the hero.,"The suffering of Noah as he watches his beloved in the stages of Alzheimers disease is the most poignant and realistic part of this novel. Aside from the sugar coating of certain hospital moments, these scenes provide an education to those of us who are unaware. Yes-be prepared to cry"
4,"Not great lit., but a fantastic love story that ages.","The real love story of this book is not the young, sensual love of their youth, but the extraordinary love and devotion in their last moments of life. Sparks recreates the struggles of age and Alzheimer's beautifully; and, thank goodness, he gives us hope that true love can endure them both. It's hard to recommend a novel that hurts this much to read; and certainly, I cannot advise the cynic or those who have never loved to read this. However, I do highly recommend it to those who have loved or have witnessed such a love in their parents or others they have known. It gives us all hope that there is still some beauty in wearing out. I just wish Sparks could have made Noah 96 years old instead of early eighties."
5,Most beautiful love story I have ever read *spoilers*,"This is the quickest book I have ever read. It was THAT addicting and hard to put down.I surprisingly enjoyed the time lapse in the book. After completing it, I thought ""wow, it only took them two days to fall in love again,"" but I did not realize it had been such a short amount of time while reading. Allie and Noah really do love each other, and Noah's love for her especially is what broke my heart by the end of the book. He never once gave up on her.I find it painfully beautiful that he reads ""their story"" to her everyday day or so. If I were to become ill like Allie, I would want the same thing. I completely broke down when she said his name on the last page, when she remembered him. That gave me hope that love can truly find a way through time."
1,not romantic,"First of all, I am a huge historical romance reader. I have read MANY historical romance books out there. I did not find this book romantic and sweet at all. It was depressing and too unbelievable. Believe me, I love FICTION and stories that seem like they can only happen in fairy tales, but COME ON, just as someone else said, Alzheimer's can't be cured!!! Why did Nicholas Sparks even want to add Alzheimer's disease in his story? This is just insulting to people who have Alzheimer's disease or to people with grandparents who have it. Can't he find another issue to write about in his book?"
4,"This is a cleverly written, touching love story.","Since I work in a nursing home which has a special Alzheimer's/dementia care area, I was impressed with Noah's clever and sensitive ways of communicating with his wife. I was particularly struck with his idea of beginning a brand new relationship with her on those days she did not recognize him. That idea was a very caring, loving thing for him to do. A number of our staff and families have read or are reading this book. It is definitely worth investing some of your time."
3,The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks,"A rather thin, simply written novel without much substance.Very quickly read, the novel is a rare example of the movie'sadaptation being better than the book."
1,Sparks: an Erich Segal for the 1990s,"The Notebook is one of the worst books I've read in this decade. This is not literature--this is women's magazine fiction from the 1950s (except they would have toned down the sex scenes). If I was a Southerner, I would be embarrassed by this one. Was Sparks subsidized by the Alzheimers Research Fund or some group? They should have spent their $$$$$ on a cure instead. If you want to read a great love story, buy Ethan Frome by the wonderful Edith Wharton."
1,"Boring, Unoriginal, Sappy","One of those rare books that is worse than the film. What drew me to the standard and over-done rich girl-poor guy, love triangle in the film was that there was a lot of unique chemistry between Noah and Allie, a deep passion. The best part was that they fought like a real couple, matched up perfectly because they fought. Noah was a unique character, sort of bitter and broken by war and heart break. The book, on the other hand, was all sap and the flat characters, their romance sickeningly sweet. The prose was whiny and boring. It was simple and unoriginal. Grade: D"
1,I would rather stab myself in the foot than to have to read this again,"I would like those 3 hours back Mr. Sparks.This book lacked substance, was choppy, predictable, and uncreative. Writing was that of a middle school student. Extremely disappointing. I am super curious how the movie is. I didn't even read the insert at the end of the book for Nicolas Spark's next book, as I just wanted The Notebook to endddddd."
1,"Unoriginal, predictable.","I read this book expecting a deeper story. The story is touching on some accounts, but the direction the story takes is incredibly obvious. There is no element of surprise, or anything that makes the book worth reading to the end."
5,heart warming saga of true love,I was amazaed to go through this work. It moved my heart. Made me feel that all i thought of true love but could never express in words was all put down in this book. I would recommend everyone to read this book as its truly marvellous. Its so warm and real that it enriches your heart and soul!
1,Contrived to bring tears in a most unoriginal manner.,"I love a good, romantic story as much as anyone, but this story is a huge waste of time. Its only salvation is that it's short. After the first few pages, the rest of the book is entirely predictable and unoriginal. What would you call the written equivalent to a paint by number picture?"
1,Hairy Plodder & the Chamber of Boredom,"My dissatisfaction with this book may stem from the fact that I'm listening to it on tape, and thus can't skim through the dull bits and eruptions of poor writing.In the first two tapes, the phrase, ""S/he ran his/her hand through his/her hair"" is repeated at least 5 times. Many other uninteresting, repetitive details choke the recitation of this wooden tale.There may be a good story hiding in here, but it is decked over with stereotypes (""emerald-eyed"" Allie, ""muscular"" Noah), poor writing (all that messed-up hair!), and miscellaneous goop. The only remotely interesting character is Clem the 3-legged dog, but even she can't give this dull book some ""legs."""
1,I want my 5 bucks back!,"This was the most predictable, crappy piece of drivel with ridiculous characters. How many times can this dopey author have the characters say I love you. No climax, awful writing, left me angry I spent my five dollars on this instead of a Starbucks Tall Late'."
3,Not as Good as the Movie,"Like many people, I read this novel after seeing the movie. I am very happy with the concept, but the movie trumps the book in almost every way. Parts of the book feel stilted and cheesy. The book also makes the intimate scenes more graphic which takes away from some of the romance. Nevertheless, Sparks fans and romance readers will probably love it."
2,Poorly written sap,"Sentiment is a good thing, and even when a story gets a little sappy, a good writer can make it into a thing of beauty. THE NOTEBOOK, unfortunately, was not blessed with a particularly good writer. The plot is very thin, the ""suspense"" is not suspenceful, and the writing itself...ouch. Sparks has quite a following, but his work isn't even good enough to be considered escape reading; it's too full of distracting bad grammar, etc, etc. If you must read it, get this one from the library."
5,Provocative. For all those (male/female)who believe in love.,"I have just completed reading ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks"" and a more rewarding, emotionally fulfilling, provocative novel I have yet to read. Everyone hopes for a love mirroring Allie's and Noah's - most will seek it, but few will find it. Sparks has challenged the odds and won. No female author, in my opinion, has been successful in capturing the hearts of both male and famale. If I didn't know otherwise, I might think a woman wrote this novel"
5,Long Term Unconditional Love,"I loved this book because it reminds me so much of my parents' story of true love. Just like in the book, my parents were madly in love and my Mom suffered from Alzheimer's the last years of her life. My parents died one month apart after sixty-seven years of marriage. This book is so realistic in that it shows what power love can have over the long haul and in spite of all obstacles. The husband and wife in this story are so real to me and can help you believe in true love if you are a cynic. I think the type of love this couple has in The Notebook is something we all can strive for. Definitely worth reading, but read it where you don't mind a tear here and there.Power Path to Love"
4,I never really enjoyed this romantic books. OLSOS DMC,"I never really enjoyed romantic books, but this book stole my heart. Normally I hate to see a movie before I read the book. This time I gave in and went to see the movie with my best friend. The movie was incredible. I figured that if I enjoyed the movie so much I must love the book. I read the book, and it was awesome too. Unlike the book, the movie focused mainly on their summer affair. The book, on other hand, showed me the love they shared, the life they lived apart, and the life they lived together. Both book and movie created tears. I cried for a half hour after I saw the movie. It's just a beautiful book. But it's a matter of taste, if you want to see their summer together - go get the movie. If you want to see the love they shared - go get the book. This book showed me what I truly want in love. I do recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't really like romantic books."
1,Horrendous,"This book went straight into the trash as soon as I was finished with it--it needed to be recycled into a milk container. So you ask if I hated it so much why did I finish it? Because there was about an eighth of an inch left of pages and I figured oh surely there is more to this story--maybe a surprise ending, a little character development, a plot...but nooooooo. The pages were a combination interview and a preview of his NEXT BOOK!!!! AS IF!!!!This is a harlequin novel with contrived characters so in love with eachother that Sparks didn't need to bother to give them personalities. Don't bother to give this book the time of day. Now I understand what ""save a tree"" means."
4,"Short read, Tear Jerker, Excellent writing",This book was a quick read. Excellent story telling that kept you wanting to get involved in the story. With enough of a plot twist to keep the less romantically inclined enjoying the book. It is well worth a read for anyone with a desire for a good tear jerker. His imagery pulls you into the beauty of the region you can feel his love for the area in his writing.
3,Light read. Heartwarming.,"After working with Alzheimer's patients for over three years, I found this book both touching and somewhat misleading. I enjoyed this tale and would recommend it to someone who wants a cathartic tear jerker."
5,The best lovestory of all times!,"This book typifies the best lovestory ever told. If two people are meant to be, no distance and boundaries can keep them together. It is well-written and the characters are very much alive and you can feel them with all the emotions that goes along with the story. It speaks of hope, strenght and true love amidst all of life's troubled roads. A real tear-jerker till the end, anyone who has read this book can say that this story is written for him."
3,Too romantic to be true!,"A love story for those who still believe that love can last a lifetime. Good reading for someone very romantic, but if you are a down-to-earth person, this book is definitely not for you."
2,"Too Much Sugar, Not Enough Substance","At the heart of this novel is a lovely and romantic story. However, a book needs more than a nice plot to make it a good read.Sparks seems unable to let his characters develop naturally. Instead, characters are introduced for the sole purpose of assuring the reader that the protagonist is a good and generous fellow, then quickly dropped.Add to this Sparks' bland narrative style and you're left with a story that feels hollow. This novel could have been so much more, but I finished the book feeling like I had been the victim of a cheap attempt to tug my heartstrings."
4,A Beautiful Book,"I really liked this book because it was so very romantic. Yes, it was flowery and a little cliched but oh for a perfect love like they shared... Helped me reaffirm my belief that love can endure."
5,This is a book which evokes our best emotions and thoughts.,"I know this book will stay with me for a long time. Although it is a simple book, the feelings it evokes are not simple, but deep. It's the kind of book which brings out the best emotions a human being can have. That is its strength. &lt;P&gt; Those who take the dialogue and descriptions out of context and disparage them, are ignoring the whole idea of the book. I thought the letters were touching and the love described beautiful. The simple language goes well with the simple ideal of true love. Although it may be a simple ideal, we can't ignore the universality of it. It is this universality which gives the book its realism."
5,pure love,"this was the most beautiful love story i've read in ages. don't be put off by the slow start of the first chapter, keep reading. it will grab you and keep you reading, wanting more. totally satisfying"
4,Of the three,"Of the three very good books I've recently read (Bark of the Dogwood, Purpose Driven Life and this one) The Notebook is the best, followed by the ""Dogwood"" book. This Sparks novel is not what I'd generally warm to, but I went into the reading with both eyes opened. Short and sweet."
1,I couldn't wait until it was over.,"This was a book I picked up to read on the airplane coming home from a vacation. I was laughing out loud and reading excerpts to my husband because I could not believe how poorly it is written. It will not be enjoyed by any educated cosmopolitan individual. The sweetness is so forced and the characters so bland it maked me truly believe that ANYONE can get their work published. I am shocked at the acclaim this book is getting. And I thought ""Titanic"" was bad. Please save your money and find a book that might give your brain a workout."
3,"A good vacation read, very romantic, but sophmoric","Sparks tells a story that tugs at your heart strings, and can easily be read in a day, but this could have been a real, and more interesting novel if he'd taken the time and effort to develop the heroine and expand on her motivations."
4,Wonderful...Great...Bittersweet...,This book was a wonderful love story. The boy getting the girl isn't as easy as it always was. Mr. Sparks has a true talent. Would recomend this to anyone!
4,The Notebook,A beautiful book. Nicholas Sparks has a way with words. He can develop a romance and put just enough drama into it to make it exciting. The Notebook has a wonderful plot. Read it!
2,Loved the movie!,"The movie was tons better. I didn't care too much for the ending in this book.The movie makes me cry. The book didn't. I was expecting to get a good cry from the book, and I didn't. I was disappointed."
4,"Wonderfully written, very moving book.",I picked this book up on a whim and didn't put it down until I had finished it. I very much enjoyed it. It was a wonderfully written lifelong lovestory and very moving. Very accurate portrayal of Alzheimer's. I've had it a week and already lent it out twice.
3,I have never cried so much and rolled them at the same time.,"""The Notebook"" is on par with ""The Horse Whisperer"". The writing and plot is attrocious, complete sap. So, why couldn't I stop crying? I guess it has to do with my undying romantic tendencies. Romance is fanciful and not based in reality, and the characters are so far from reality they would have to book a flight back. This story would never happen in the real world. It's a quick read, enjoyable, but pretty fluffy. I liken it to cotton candy, it looks pretty but not a whole lot of substance."
4,This book brought tears to my eyes...,"I really enjoyed Nicholar Sparks' ""The Notebook."" I liked how all the characters were developed very well. You could tell so much about Noah and Allie by just what Nicholas was commenting that they did. A few times in the book I had tears in my eyes. It was very touhcing. I most likely reccomend this book."
4,An enchanted avenue to romance...,"It is hard to believe that Nicolas Sparks has created not one, but two intriguing love stories.(and he's a man! Not to set stereotypes or anything!) Sparks' writing style is uncomplicated and quite enjoyable. ""The Notebook"" is a quick, insightful read. The book communicates the essence of true love, which should not be taken for granted...if only it was that simple. I do not recommend reading this particular story if you are not a romantic at heart."
1,Book was in poor condition,Book was in poor condition. It was not at all acceptable condition of book. Book was not well described in the descriptiona. Book has stain on almost all pages. Looks like this book got wet earlierb. All pages on the top right end corner was crushed/folded
1,the worst book I ever read,"A friend gave me this book to read on a plane. he loved it and it made him cry. I was excited to give it a try. The worst book I have ever, ever read in my life. The writing style (lexicon used, vocabulary, etc) is so poor, that a 9 year elementary school student can write with more imagination. What a miserable prose... The plot is weak, the characters (that are flawlessly perfect in every way) are flat, 2 dimensional, no development. The story is not credible to begin with. The writing is repetitive, the author has no imaginative ideas, in addition he makes factual mistakes (in 1946 his Noah is wearing jeans like James Dean, but in fact, these pants werent even called jeans at that time, nor they were in fashion). Someone who reads Nabokov, Umberto Eco, Markos Garcia, Marcel Proust-- never should touch books by Sparks. It is a shame, I cant believe that some people actually rate it 5 stars."
3,Touching Story. . .,"I really enjoyed this story. Its a nice warm and fuzzy feel good story, great for a rainy day. However, if you are looking for depth and a book with strong literary value, then, maybe this one isnt for you. Setting that aside, it made me shed a few tears and want to pass it along to my friends. Its well worth the few bucks it costs."
2,Mildly entertaining story,"This book has a decent plot line,however the characters aren't as well developed as they should be, which makes it difficult to connect with the story. The awful prose is was so trite and dull it was painful to my eyes. But I had an eight hour flight so I finished it out of boredom. The ending wash rushed and should have been more focused and detailed. If you like ""literary"" literature, ie excellent prose and style, you will not enjoy this book."
3,"Not great, not terrible","Ally Walker does a nice job with the meatiest role in the film, trying to find out why so many severed hands have been found, who is responsible, and whether a mentally disturbed young person knows something about it.Martin Sheen's considerable talents are wasted in his tiny supporting role."
5,Rudy Vallee at his best,"Most of the recordings that one hears of Rudy Vallee are from the twenties when recording was still in its infancy. In those old recordings his voice comes across as tinny and nasal. This album contains recordings from the thirties or forties and show Vallee at his best, with a much warmer and very pleasant voice. His version of ""as time goes by"" is perfectly charming, as is the ""Maine Stein Song"" and ""A Tavern in the Town."" If one is going to have a single Rudy Vallee album, this is the one to get."
2,Wrong size,"They came and they were the wrong size. Be sure to order size larger than you're used to. Or maybe even bigger than that. They're very heavy clogs otherwise. I pay for shipping to send them back, there in New York, so it cost me about 10 bucks to ship them - what a rip off. No exchange program nothing. Not too pleased."
4,Great garden shoes,"These are good for wet climates; they,re very sturdy, non-slip, with a comfy inner lining. Love finding these on sale!"
5,The Perfect Garden (and everywhere) shoe,"I found it! The perfect gardening shoe that is durable AND comfortable AND cute! Got these this week and I was surprised about the cushioning. Also, I am normally a size 7.5-8 and I got 8's. They are very well fitted, not a ton of room to ""slosh"" around. I assume they will stretch out a bit as well so I kind of appreciate that."
5,Stay on great....,"I purchased these for quick outdoor chores and I love them. They stay on well...can even put them on over my isotoner type slippers. Clean up quick and easy, comfortable, I'm glad I bought them."
5,Green Clogger Go in the Garden,"These green cloggers were an excellent choice for garden shoes and wearing around my studio. They slip off my feet easily when I come in and out of the house, yet my feet fit snuggly inside the shoe. I did see a similar pair without the liner in a store (at a lower price), but they didn't have the lining on the inside. The lining offers a firm cushion for my foot inside the shoe.In my studio and outside for gardening the sole gives a firm grip on the ground. Walking across rocks, up and down hills, or climbing a ladder, I always feel safe."
3,Run very small,"I got size 6 and these shoes measure an inch shorter than all my shoes which are size six. They were cheaper than Crocs so I kept them as I only wear them for gardening however, since they are wide I have to wear thick socks with them or they fly right off my foot. Size 7 wouldn't have scrunched my toes but I never would have been able to keep them on."
4,Comfy but warm,"These shoes are comfy! I wear a 7 1/2 and bought an 8, fits great! I wore them for about 45 minutes in 75 degree weather and my feel were clammy after. These will be great from Fall winter and early morning yard work."
3,Size 8 runs small,"Shoes arrived promptly and look great. Unfortunately, they don't fit. I normally wear between a 7.5 and an 8. Bought the 8, and it is too small. For $20, not sure if it's worth returning them and trying on the 9. Might gift them."
2,Laughable? Perhaps.,"I like Nora Ephron. Really. I thought When Harry Met Sally was quite a film, very cleverly written. Perhaps, however, I shouldn't hold Ms. Ephron in such high esteem that I immediately buy anything with her name on it. No, she didn't write PS Your Cat is Dead...but she did endorse it. And shame on you, Nora. This book made me laugh countless times, but never at anything the author intended to be humorous. Rather, I laughed at the sheer absurdity of the dialogue. Never have I heard people speak in the way these characters did. They were overly witty and brazen, as well as entirely one-dimensional. As much as I disliked this book, I would recommend it to self-declared ""theatre types."" What they saw in Rent (the film, of course) I shall never know, but they will almost certainly find that same element in PS Your Cat is Dead."
2,meh,I think the concept of this book might have been funny but then it took a creepy turn and was actually not funny at all. I hardly laughed through the entire book and was wondering what all the other people were reading when they gave it such good reviews...
4,Excellent book,"Surprising, entertaining, thought-provoking. Read it when you're down, you'll be up by the time it's over, except for wishing there was more for you to read. I hesitate to tell you more for fear of revealing plot elements that are best appreciated when and how revealed by the author. If you like A Catcher in the Rye, you will probably like this book (although I think Salinger's book is better.)"
2,Four months to first Issue!,I ordered the Magazine subscription on February 6 2011 and my first magazine will arrive June 6th!!!!. Actually this is rather ironic because they are doing business like it is the 1940s! Maybe they are setting the type manually and using a printing press.
1,"This ain't Shakespeare, Baby!","Uh huh, this guy's a genius. Technology will soon take over and kill us all, UNLESS you read this book and develop the so-called ""habits of the high tech heart"". Baloney! My computer has made no attempts on my life since I bought it, and it's out of warranty to boot! Skip this book unless you get chills everytime your alarm clock wakes you up. Eeeck! Technology! I'm trembling! Technology's out to get you! Haha, or so Schultze would like you to believe!"
1,"Let's be honest, this woman's voice s**ks. she can't sing.","Unfortunately Lucinda's CD is recommended by Amazon.com (in this case), and she may well be purchased by numerous tone deaf listener's but unfortunately the vocals are horrifying. hate to burst your bubble. This ain't music !"
5,authenticity and grit,"Lucinda sends it straight from the heart with animal magnetism and personal storytelling. No lightweight overproduced fluff here. Some might not have the guts to match Lucinda and hear what she has to say, but her music rocks for anyone who can get into a listening mood and go wiht the music. While you are doing that, listen to what she has to say. From ""The way you move is right in time - is right in time with me"" to ""All I ask - don't tell anybody the secrets, don't tell anybody the secrets I told you"" LW gives us a very personal contemporary expression of emotion that anyone who is honest with him or herself can identify with. Pure grit, pure truth, pure art, and just great music."
5,Lucinda Williams - The Goddess of rural American soul.,"Lucinda's music is so direct, natural, and matter of fact. It is as though she were singing/speaking directly to you personally.Why this magnificent woman is not blowing the top off the sales charts is beyond me!If you like the music of Americana, you will love this. No female artist since Janice Joplin has hit me as hard. I loved Janice, but Lucinda is even better! She is much more subtle, yet hits like a .44 magnum!"
1,I was extremely disappointed with this recording.,"This recording was repetitive, flat, and monotonous. The bottem line, it just isn't country. It was a total waste of money and will cause me to think twice before I order over the Internet."
4,Finch Fortidiet Eggcite - 100032230 - Bci,My birds seem to eat the food well enough just didn't appreciate the bag not getting pack correctly so when I received it. It was litterly all over everything else in the order not to mention my supply was mainly wasted. Amazon did make it right. But still it should not have happen. the price was cheaper at the time but I found with shipping its not a great deal.
5,Cannot be matched.,"For the serious bible student, interested in knowing what the New Testament is saying in its original Koine Greek, this is an invaluable set. Marvin Vincent's work has never been equaled and scholars have used it since it was first published in the turn of the century, (twentieth century, that is). I purchased for my church library and I have received nothing but kudos since."
5,Strong Debut from a Promising New Artist,"It's a little rough around the edges, but all in all, this album is an impressive debut. She's got the talent, and now it's just a matter of time before she hits it big. ""July"" and ""Good You Make It"" have the right hooks to become mainstream hits. Emm's music lacks the maturity and sophistication of other seasoned pop veterans, but her creative use of guitars and keyboards make this a step above your average alternative-pop album. Make no mistake; although she may look it, she's no Natalie Imbruglia clone."
2,Potentially amusing but smothered in political correctness,"Any potential for humour from an ""Islam meets The West cultural clash"", played out in a school in suburban South London, is drowned in a sea of coy self-righteousness. Typical of so many liberal writers lookin at minority cultures, Nigel Williams falls into that familiar trap of displaying excess of sympathy but absence of empathy. The result is strangely unappealing, stilted and distant.The Independent on Sunday describes this book as ""screamingly funny""; in truth, it's an untidy story that, I suppose, raises the odd chuckle. I can't comment on his other books, but they're supposed to be better than this."
5,Industry standard used everywhere,"Nice feel, and comfortable to use. High-vis, and rarely stolen at work, as you're the only one with a set!. Stupidly, I used the largest one as a pry bar, and snapped the end clear off, and the old set is showing it's age. Good buy, but better suited to the professional/lineman application, you can wrap tape around cheaper screwdrivers for the home. 100% recommended."
3,Printout of the PDFs included with FCP,I guess I missed in the online description that this book is actually a printout of the PDF tutorials already included with FCP Studio. Wish I knew before buying. Could be a good reference for those who don't like reading the PDF's and switching back and forth between programs.For $22 I guess I'll make the best of it.
1,"Roppe Corporation HC40C51S100 4""X20' Black Wall Base",all I can say is fast shipping the backing on this didnt work at all had to have people hold it up so I could nail it to the wall
1,Live & Scrapy,"This was obviously recorded at a concert with poor sound equipment and shows it. I am very disappointed in the quality, worst I have ever had."
5,4-in-1,"Trevanian is his pen name and he is not who I thought he was. Great book to expand your vocab if you stop and look-up all the tuff words like DEPENDENT, and it is not what you think.Great stories, well written, fun ride for a book that's over 30 years old."
5,Excellent Star Reference,"My Dad requests this calendar every year. It is well worth the expense. He refers to it often throughout the year. This year we were especially happy with the cover which depicts Navajo constellations. As Dad is an amateur expert on Indian Lore, this was of special interest to him."
2,"States ""soft"", really should be ""scratchy""","I received this in the mail, opened up the zipper bag it was in, touched the blanket and immediately returned it to amazon. This blanket is not luxurious like it states and is more scratchy than soft. Do not waste your money on this awful blanket."
3,Works fine for it's intended purpose,"I purchased 7 of these flashlights for my security crew. The lights arrived quickly, they were inexpensive and they work good. No complaints."
1,Inaccurate,"I compared this thermometer with a brand new one given to me by a nurse. Professional thermometer read: 97.9, 97.9, 97.9 (normal for me). Vicks read: 98.4, 98.3, 98.4, 97.8. 97.9, 98.0, 98.0, 98.0. Fifteen minutes later, professional read: 97.8, 97.8. Vicks read: 98.2, 97.9, 97.7. This degree of inaccuracy raises serious questions about the manufacturer."
5,Extraordinary Film,"When Laurence Olivier introduced this film at the midnight screening in London he said: ""It is the best ensemble acting since Citizen Kane."" After seeing this film today I couldn't agree more. Astonishing performances by Ben Gazzara, George Peppard, Pat Hingle, Mark Richman (The Strange One was their film debut!) and brilliant direction by Jack Garfein."
1,The worst guitar video EVER!,"This has to be the worst guitar video EVER!Craig just plays a bunch of real fast stuff and doesn't slow anything down or explain anything.Also,this is called ""Hard Rock-Heavy Metal Lead Guitar"" and he puts a LOT of emphasis on the rhythm part to the song ""Dream Evil"".GREAT song,but I can learn it through tabs if I wanted.The box says that is has hammer on and pull off exercises when it doesn't and it doesn't have ANY tapping licks.If you are an intermediate metal guitarist like I am,skip this video and get Paul Gilbert's ""Intense Rock:Sequences and Techinques"".It is a bit pricey,but it is well worth it."
3,"Please, Stop Eating My Throat Little Boy!...","Stephen King's book PET SEMATARY scared the $#!t out of me! I found the movie version entertaining, but not quite as frightening. I liked Denise Crosby as Mrs. Creed, and the kids were good. Dad was okay as well. Fred Gwynne made a decent Jud Crandel too. I guess I just wanted to be scared $#!tless again! Really, the only complaint I have about the movie is the showing of the resurrected Gage. Seeing his baby face made things far less terrifying than just showing his back, or a hand (like when the hand came from under the bed) or his shadow running past. Anyway, PET SEMATARY had it's moments. Zelda was suitably creepy, as she lurched about wheezing and cackling. The kitty that played Church was great! The actual pet cemetery and the Mic Mac burial ground were well done. I did miss the wendigo though! Oh yeah, and how about the fact that the only traffic on the road seemed to be those speeding ORINKO fuel trucks? Pretty funny! Enjoy..."
3,"""The soil of a man's heart is stonier....""","A lot of Stephen King's books and short stories were made into crappy movies, but this one is good. It scared me in a lot of places and I purchased the DVD and have watched it numerous times. ""The soil of a man's heart is stonier...."" is the truest thing I ever heard. Eventhough I have no idea what it means."
4,Very accurate rendition of the novel.,"Reiterating what other reviewers have stated, ""Pet Sematary"" is one of the most disturbing and suspenseful books that I have ever come across. And as opposed to most Stephen King flics, which are usually half or one-star disasters, the movie, Pet Sematary is actually just as good, if not better than the novel and follows the novel very accurately.The actors used in the movie are just the way that I imagined them being in the book: down-to-earth family people, but interesting and solid. As far as I could tell, there were no inaccuracies between the novel and the movie and the few parts of the book that the movie may have omitted were unimportant, non-suspenseful sections. In a nutshell, the acting was great, the suspense was even better than in the book, and this is probably the best King film that I have ever seen."
2,Stephen King butchers Stephen King,"There are a lot of disturbing things about the film adaption of Stephen King's PET SEMATARY--and I don't mean ""good horror disturbing."" The worst is that Stephen King finally got the chance to adapt his own novel for the screen. And he butchers his story as bad as any other hack job that's ever been done. Maybe it looked good on paper (I'm referring to the script), but it's a wreck onscreen.What also really bothered me was how the filmmakers portrayed a woman's disabling disease as if she was just a horror film monster freak.The cast tries hard. And I disagree with the previous review--the ""Star Trek chick"" was far from distracting. I've never watched Star Trek so I thought she was good.PET SEMATARY is one of King's most effective and frigthening stories. Unfortunately, onscreen it never rises above being just a dumb gory slasher flick."
5,SCARY!,I never understood why some horror movies are rated low because of their storyline or plot. Horror movies are supposed to be scary! Who cares about the storyline! Pet Semetary 1 and 2 are two of the most terrifying horror movies I've ever seen. Two other horrifying classics that will scare you too death are the 90's Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead.
4,Ok...,"This movie was ok... My favorite part was when Gage got hit by the truck... I know it's mean, but it was hilarious!!! It's pretty weird, but it's ok... You still have to admit it was funny when Gage got hit by the truck! Ha!"
3,Pet Sematary.....,"I don't understand the bad reviews about this movie. I found this to be a Good movie. I've seen many movies made from Stephen King books and some have been a great letdown but this one is not one of them. Great acting..... especially Dale Midkiff!! and the little boy who plays Gage. The second half of the movie is especially suspenseful as we see Gage ""come back to life"" after being buried in the Pet Sematary with murder on his mind. Although not a bloody/gory movie, there is enough suspense and thrills in Pet Sematary to keep anyone interested!!"
4,Good horror!,"Pet Semetary, unlike many King adaptions to the screen is mostly faithful to the book, which is why it is possibly the best book-to-screen King story of all time.This film starts out with a young family looking to get away from the stressful big city life, but it all soon turns into a nightmare. The highlight of this movie is the playful yet creepy ghost[The one on the cover] who huants Mr. Creed, telling him that a line has been crossed. The scariest part of this movie is the late sister Zelda of Mrs. Creed, who's face and body have been horribly disfigured as she screams out in evil pain.This movie is one that you may not like at all, or may even take offense to it, but it deals with the lines between life and death and brings suspense and fear to you. The sequel may suck, but this movie is a keeper, so I give it a strong 4 out of 5."
2,Pet Sematary,"This movie was easy to follow and ok if you read the book. Otherwise, it was less than average for those who didn't read the book."
3,Not what I expected,This movie was not what my family expected. This is not a movie that my family will watch again or recommend to our friends.
1,not a serious tool,"This tool broke after just a few wires stripped. The interior component are all low grade plastic, and far too flimsy for anything but the smallest wire gauges.Mine broke on 18 gauge stranded wire.Elegant design, poor execution."
4,Enjoyable and informative - good detective work,"I found this book very interesting. I would like to think I am reasonably open minded (without being empty minded) when it comes to issues surrounding the paranormal. I find over zealous, simplistic and badly researched material a trial whichever side it is coming down on (belief in a paranormal or not). Happily this is not such a book. It is well researched and solidly presented. Although you can sometimes get a bit tired of anecdote after anecdote, I guess it does get the point across that something real is happening. The author goes a step further than anecdotes and personal testimonies. He looks for patterns of operation and draws on his own practical experience along with other research in the field to present a practical theory of when and why telepathy occurs.The dry sense of humour is an acquired taste though:)"
3,Dangerous Friends by Viertel,"It was not what I expected. This book was recommended by Steve Hodel in his books about his father and the Black Dahlia. In his books, the 1940's and 1950's celebs' names kept popping up, including Peter Viertel's. Supposedly, Peter Viertel and George Hodel were very good friends; Steve hinted that Viertel knew that George murdered Betty Short (the Black Dahlia). In the actual Viertel's book, Dangerous Friends, nothing like that is mentioned, directly or otherwise. It's basically just a romp thru the celebrities' lives of the times.Good book; interesting. But not what I personally expected."
2,messy,i have used products like this beforenot easy to use must clean the vinyl wellbefore you try using or repair will not hold
2,Fast but not accurate,"This thermometer is not very accurate. I can take my baby's temperature 3 times in 3 minutes, and I will get a different reading each time. If she is not running fever, the reading varies greatly each time, usually well under 97. On a more positive note, when she is running fever, it does seem to be a little more consistent and accurate. It gives a quick reading, and it doesn't bother her at all when I take her temperature under her arm."
3,Hot and Cold Response,"Really interesting novel of a Norwegian consul in Shanghai during the mid 1920's and his daughters who go back and forth to China before the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Interesting also that the author warns about Asians in the future, especially Japanese, Chinese, and Indians and their future influence in world power (This was written in 1958) . Her book goes into the Japanese part of WWII, but Germany is mentioned only briefly and in passing. She says nothing at all about the German quest for world power during the same war. Interesting omission, since this was written only 13 or so years after WWII, and by a German author who would have had fresh memories of the war in Europe."
2,Very Academic,I found very little practical advice on short selling strategies. There was considerable theoretical discussion of the risks and rewards of short selling. I would recommend this book only for those who were looking to improve their understanding of financial theory.
3,All the guest stars is worth it.,"the album isn't bad, but steven tyler and alanis morrisette make the album. steven sings back up, plays harmonica, and drums. he sounds great. if you can get past ringo's voice and listen to all of the background vocalists(ozzy osbourne, scott weiland, tom petty, joe walsh, mccartney, alanis, and steven tyler, just to name a few) you will probably like it."
3,"Buy ""Time Takes Time"" for good music, Vertical Man for Ringo","Vertical Man is a kind of return to the early ""pop"" of Ringo that we bought because we loved him, it sounds very familiar and not interesting. But it inspired me to buy ""Time Takes Time"" as a review of VM commentted on the critical acclaim TTT recieved with out much fan support at the cash registers. So I bought TTT and am suprised that I love it, much more meat than on other Ringo album as far as I am concerned and I have most of them more out of loyalty than content. TTT is a very good album, VM is Ringo Starr and he will always have my best wishes!"
3,"Okay, but one can only take so much Ringo","Being an ex-Beatlemaniac, I decided to explore albums by each solo Beatle. This is my third Ringo album (the first 2 were both his 'best of' albums), and probably the last I'll purchase. Ringo's style is harmless pop-rock music, and I tend to get sick of it after a while. Also, this album's production makes the songs sound like something I'd hear on VH-1. The only failure here is ""Love Me Do,"" an old Beatles tune doesn't need to be remade for the '90s. The superstar cover of ""Drift Away"" was not as bad as I feared it would be, but it still doesn't work. All the other songs are passable pop-rock, with a hint of country (""I'll Be Fine Anywhere"") and an attempt at Eastern sound (""Without Understanding""). Ringo fans should love this album, but I'll just stick to solo works of the other 3 Beatles."
1,A drummer for a important band,aside from playing with the Beatles what else has Ringo Starr done worth noting musically? he's not Quincy Jones.all the talent in the world can't cover up how run of the mill he is.George Harrison can write a little bit.he is at least so-so.but if you don't know it's time to know that it's downhill after Lennon&Mccartney.they had&have all of the main talent from the Beatles.Ringo Starr is the Yoko Ono of the band.
5,No problems - as advertised,"Installed and worked fine, seems ok.. not expecting any trouble as it's just on a wheel barrow and doesn't get much abuse.."
4,Bionicle Mania,"My son loves these, and had been begging me for this. I finally decided to buy it for him, because I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price."
5,Dress up is fun,Our 4 year old grand daughter loved this. Her and her friends spend lots of time dressing up.It does not come with shoes - just so you know.
2,WAY too small for a 3 year old,"I didn't expect much as far as quality goes because the price is so low. But since it is sold for ages 3 and up, I would have expected it to fit my three year old. The tops barely cover her tummy. She was very disappointed and uncomfortable having her stomach exposed. She looks like a hootchie princess. My daughter wears a 3T or a 4T. These I'd guess are sized perhaps 24 mos. The head bands must be sized to fit maybe a 1 year old. They are very tiny.Other complaints: One of the earrings was broken in the package. It doesn't matter though because they are such junk, I just threw all the jewelry in the trash.I suppose I'll have to get out the sewing machine and see if I can come up with a solution to make these work for her."
3,"Pretty box, not much in it","The outfits are cute, but not a lot in this box. I went to the dollar stora and bought a Tierra, bracelets, bowas, necklaces, magic wand and pomp pomps with a megaphone to soup it up a little. My granddaughter is three and loved the bracelets best. Box originally came damaged but seller sent me a replacement Immediately. Definately a great seller."
3,"good book, lousy grammar","I enjoyed the story and characters, though the plot of Alien Taste was predictable, but what really made me put this writer down and have to force myself to pick her back up is her ghastly grammar. She knows nothing of possessive gerunds (I'm tired of you doing this---is supposed to be ""I'm tired of YOUR doing this"" and many other repetitive errors, like using the word ""conceited"" when she means ""conceded."" Where are the copyeditors? I could ignore these stumbles if this were (note I said WERE) the way some characters spoke and not others, but the repetition of the same bad grammar has PROVEN that the writer simply speaks this way herself. These annoying habits of devolving language and sloppiness with our own native tongue will stain an otherwise good storyteller for me. Professional writers should hold themselves to higher standards and learn the skills of their trade well. ""Well"", not ""good."""
4,a different kind of fantasy,"Tainted Trail is the second Ukiah Oregon story after Alien Taste. It picks up not to long after the first one. I like the charactors in the book and the way they relate to each other. During the course of the book Ukiah learns more about his heritage and who he is. In order to enjoy this series you have to be able to suspend your disbelief. Not the best fantasy I have read, but I did like it."
2,Not and objective view,"I think this was written by someone who was unable to uphold their laws and is fairly bitter about it. Now that I think about it, if I wanted to find out how good a university was I wouldn't base my decision on the information from someone that was expelled from the school. It would be a lot wiser use of my time to speak to the students. So there is no real qualified information that you can base a decision on."
3,That should have been in the description,In the picture these pants just look like regular skinny jeans. But what they should have told me is that these pants are extremely itchy and smelled when I got them
2,Accugreen 3000 -- UPDATE -- Five Stars,"UPDATE: I contacted Scotts via their website, received an email inquiring about my calibration barrel (apparently there are two), and a week later an entire new handle showed up on my porch via FedEx. Replacing and re-calibration took about 3 minutes with their instructions. Very, very impressed. I don't know why I can't change the stars on this review, but if I could I would return this product rating to 5 stars.Original post: I like Scotts products, and I like their drop spreaders, but this one disappointed me. I'm not sure if the 1000 has the same trigger handle that the 3000 has, the trigger that you pull on to distribute the product while walking, but this one is made of cheap molded plastic and it broke on me in about one year. That makes the spreader worthless. Disappointing, to say the least."
2,Poor Quality Printing,I was very disappointed when I received this little book. It looked and felt like it had been printed off of someones home computer. I was expecting the traditional hardback version but just in paperback and that was not the case. Put in a few more dollars and go for the hardback.
4,Great book,"A quality, classic book we all love to 're-readBut I am tired of having to give my opinion on EVERYTHING I purchase"
5,Reviewed by Read2Review,"The Tale Of Peter Rabbit is probably the most popular book that Beatrix Potter has written. It is beloved by many and has been reproduced all over the world for children and adults to enjoy.I love the story now as much as I did when I was a child. The story itself has a very good moral - don't steal. Peter gets into a mess when he attempts to eat from Mr McGregor's garden. He manages to escape after he is chased.I love this story, I don't think it will ever get old and I think that this book will find a very special place in others hearts as it has mine."
4,I really like this one @}->---,"Lionel Richie is so talented. He's written countless hits and sings soulfully and smoothly. He's a classic artist and one of the best around.This cd I still listen to often. It's got some upbeat songs and some great ballads. I especially love Lady (that he wrote but never sung until now - Kenny Rogers did that). Also is Stay, The Closest Thing To Heaven and Eveytime. While there were no major hits on this cd, it's still great (if not underrated) and I love it. It's for all Lionel fans and R&B; fans alike."
4,A classic thriller,"Household's upper class hero is both offensive and attractive. He would snub you as a peasant, but we delight in his approach to the Nazis as he hunts the biggest game of all - Hitler and then is hunted by the Nazis. The final sequence in the pit is a delight. A superb book to be read and enjoyed. Both versions of the film are excellent as well."
2,Eg7001,Basically is a good gun. To me this is a replica made to look like the Chinese version of the Russian designed TT-Tokarev pistol during WWII. Its pretty accurate. although I modified mine with a new spring instead of the crappy copper spring it came with.Pros--cool looking for any WWII fan-good quality-shipped fast-silent when firedCons--a bit flimsy/wobbly-plastic ammo clip-saftey design. I hate the safety on this gun! if you accidently tilt this gun the wrong way it will lock on you!
5,One of the Best!,This video has favorite classic songs of Sesame Street. It is a must for any serious Sesame Street fan.
2,oh no,"I really did not enjoy this item. Having never read the classic, I thought I could shortcut the process with the movie version. Although the delivery, pricing, etc. were all swell, I just couldn't get myself to benefit from whatever I was expecting of the story's contents. It' just too abstract and rambling for me."
3,IrishEnglish Dictionary,Not a bad little dicitionary although it is expensive (I paid $30.94). It's compact and has plenty of entries. Keep in mind the type is very small. My biggest problem is the pronunciation of the words in Irish is somewhat lacking. Simple phonetic spelling after the word would be more helpful than the standard dictionary pronunciation descriptions that they use. I am learning Irish and this is important to me. An adequate dictionary but there could be something better out there.
5,A Superb Book for Young and Old alike,I first read this great tale in elementary school and throughout the years it has been on my all time favorite list. I now have a young son who has just been born that I would love to share this fine book with. I hope the publisher reconsiders his position of letting the public own a copy of this story.
2,major disappointment,"Skaggs has done some of the most electrifying bluegrass around. But precious little of that is to be found here. About enough for two stars, and that is three stars too short. Too many smarmy pieces of garbage. If you think you are about to get some great bluegrass here, listen before you buy."
3,Classic Comedy Delivers but in Small Portions,"The LP has excellent Nichols and May material but not enough of it.More of the actual original Broadway show would have been more satisfying.The ""Best Of"" CD compilation of their work remains more satisfying."
1,Baby Sling,I own three baby carriers and the hotslings is not my favorite. Works great for infant under 6/7 months of age but became uncomfortable because of lopsided weight. Had a hard time nursing and getting use to the distribution of weight going accross instead of lining up center as with the Bjorn or Ergo carriers. Cannot adjust the sling so measurements are very important when ordering. With previous back injuries this sling did not work for me and it hurt my shoulder. I prefer the Bjorn or Ergo.
5,good clean witty fun,This little book is a great way to put things in percpective. Its witty humor and precise sarcastic definitions will take the edge of any bad day.
4,It's The Devil's Dictionary.,"What more is there to say? The story is a classic, and the ebook is solid. You'll probably enjoy if you're familiar already."
3,Devils Dictionary Defined,"Devils Dictionary, n. A cynical dictionary written by Ambrose Beirce which originaly appeared in serial forn from 1881 to 1906.The idea is a novel one- defining things as they really are with a sarcastic, tell it as it is exhubarance. Much of this book is dated although it was telling as an expose of all that was wrong with American culture in that time period. It kind of reminds me of what The Onion ............... is to us in our current time. I expected more and I thought that it would be funnier than it actually was. I only found myself laughing a three or four times. I don't think it's worth the money but I do suggest borrowing it from a friend or checking it out from the public library."
1,"Great book, awful eBook.","The content is wonderful and clever, however this particular edition's shortcomings outweigh all that. The formatting is off and the spacing is awful several words are missing.You'd be better off with a better edition."
3,No chapters for each letter,"The book is wonderful if you are a cynic or would like to know how they think. Regarding the Kindle version, I would recommend you download the mobi version at Project Gutenberg because its entry spacing is better formatted and each letter of the alphabet has its own chapter, which allows for much faster and easier browsing."
5,Funnier than the Devil,"The Devil has nothing on Bierce, (except maybe a pretty good blackmail file with color photographs). Bierce plays with the English language and presents his cynical and humorous view of the world. Biting satire would be appropriate here if the use of an ordinary dictionary were permitted. With Bierce's included definition: ""Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the authors enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness."" However, this book isn't obsolete, but becomes more evidently true as time goes on. An excellent list of definitions that insult everyone in general and everyone in particular. This book is a necessary tool to carry in your pocket and correct people's definitions at cocktail parties. You could tell people the definition of a Saint, 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited'. Someone should start a movement to canonize Bierce, since he qualifies for Sainthood by his own definition."
2,works great if it works,"lots of beeping but only occasional heat. Warrenty does not include labor, diagnosis, or shipping either way for repairs"
5,what happens in the autumn and winter for bears?,When reading this with my three year old son he liked finding the animals. Raccoons are one of his favorites. And he thought it was hilarious that I suggest he sleep all winter like a bear. The colors in the illustrations are soft and beautiful. We enjoyed reading this one together and I think it is a warming story perfect for autumn time.
5,Hidden Gem,"If Sufjan Stevens' Illinoise was last year's number 1 album,certainly Midlake's Trials of Van Occupanther should be in the running in 2006. It's sound and instrumentation is very similar and it's melodies and harmonies are exquisitely beautiful. If you are a fan of tight harmonies and unexpected melodies like those of Brian Wilson, CSN&Y; and Zero 7, you will love this album. From beginning to end, it is a gentle, haunting,hidden gem!"
3,The Past Viewed through the Present's Lens,"There are a number of songs from my youth in the 1970s and '80s that are brought to mind by this music -- mostly good stuff. If one likes certain elements of the early Eagles, CSN&Y, and Fleetwood Mac, it is likely that this disc will spend a lot of time spinning in your unit. Fortunately, the music is realized in way that does not discount the intervening years -- it is not ""retro"" in some self-conscious and ironic way -- and offers modernity by way of unique textual approaches and song structures. I find three or four of the songs particularly beautiful and moving; they are worth the price of the entire set. My only complaint with this particular release has to do with a homogeneity of texture and instrumental appoaches, otherwise, I might have given it another star or two."
4,THE BEASTIE'S GREATEST?,Cool collection but was The Biz vs The Nuge a hit? And where in the world is PAUL REVERE from Licensed to Ill?
2,Hate Mail Welcome,"I bought ""Hello Nasty"" without being familiar with their previous material and think it's wonderful. Then I got this and wondered how they ever came to be so big.There's some good stuff but mainly it's repetitive and uninspired. A few rhyming lines and a beat does not music make.I think the album is arranged chronologically, and it definitely gets stronger as it progresses, so maybe I'm missing the point."
2,i'm stunned....,"Waste of money! And i got it on sale! I simply love them but what happened? I didnt even nkow the CD came out..i walked in the video store saw it on the shelves and didn't even bother to see what songs were on it because i assumed, hey its the Beastie Boys of course the Cd is gonna rock! I got home...song after song i listened and grew more disappointed. Not saying i didnt like some songs which i did. Got a new taste from them that i already loved from other bands. But it just didnt have the spice of their best songs! Sorry...."
2,Some serious crap on this filler-album,I've deleted at least ten of the crappier songs from my MP3 rip of my CD. Damn - regretting that I bought this one now for *sure*.
2,Rehash! Shame on the Beasties,"I've only got one thing to say about this collection, it's a stab in the back to Beastie Boys fans who've already bought all the Beasties' earlier albums. Their real fans already have half the songs on this set but still have to pay for a double album if we want to get all the new or previously unreleased tracks on it.Shame on you, Beasties. I know you have the clout to keep this kind of thing from happening."
3,Unacceptable,"that this album is missing some of the best tracks off of License to Ill, including the incomparable 'Posse in Effect'. When MCA sings 'I gotta girl in a castle and one in a pagoda, you know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda', you know you are listening to genius at work."
1,Can I pick the songs next time?,"ok, this is weird. This was supposed to be a greatest hits package. And, with two cds, there shouldn't be anything left out. But they don't put ""Girls"" or ""Paul Revere"" on, but put some songs that weren't even hits!(Three Mcs and One DJ), plus the new songs that blow, such as ""Alive"". All in all, not a good buy. Get License to Ill instead."
1,Beastie Boys,"First, The Beastie boys shouldn't even be a band. I'm not sure why they even are trying to make this album alright. I embarass myself listening to this cd around people. all they do is shout like a bunch of fools and nobody understands a word they are saying. Don't waste your time or money on this or any of their cd's. Stick to Ice Cube baby."
5,Rap Pioneers Display Their Impact on Modern Music,"The beastie boys introduced us to a new concept in music. Rap in its early years was struggeling to emerge. The radio was being dominated by white rock and pop stars and was not very open to the radical concept of rap. But when three white guys came up with a theme song which got everyones attention, the walls came down. I remeber my first B-boys concert in Oklahoma City and the spectical of profanity, ludeness and vulgarity that showed me that it was allright to Raise Hell! They opended for Rap Godfathers Run DMC and their strutting and cussing and beer spitting and so on just gave me aspirations of adolescent malicious and otherwise socially unacceptable behavior! The Beastie boys are a milestone for rap and this is a great tribute to what was, is and will continue to be a cornerstone group in Rap History. They have influenced me, my delinquency, my music with my band EARCANDY and given me a lot of very fond memorys. Thanks B-Boys! PEACE!"
3,HE PUTS IT DOWN,THE ALBUM WAS HOT!!!!! BUT ON A LOWER NOTE IT COULD USE A LITTLE MORE DRAMA OR SHOULD i SAY IN DEPTH INTENSITY. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE BAGGIN BEATS WITH FRESH LYRICS ITS ON TIME. EVEN A TRUE THUG SHOULD GIVE (...) HIS PROPS. HOPE TO HEAR A SECOND MORE IN DEPTH ALBUM NEXT FROM HIM
1,Absolutely stupid,I rented season one because I was considering buying the DVDs. I am so glad I did. I chose it based on the reviews. It is about 2 women who are drunk all the time (and I mean all the time) and do drugs. What is funny about that? It was even depressing because one of the women has a teenage daughter who lives with her and has to witness what a sloppy drunk her mother is. The main actress (and I use the term loosely) totaly over acts her part. I wish someone could explain where the humor is because I certainly couldn't find it. I watched 3 of the 6 episodes on the DVD thinking maybe it would get better; it didn't. If you are considering buying this DVD I recommend you rent it first. This was absolutely stupid.
1,Funny? Yawn...,"I am not sure why somebody would compare this pathetic piece of..""art"" to SEX AND THE CITY. After reading all the ""5 stars"" reviews I ordered this DVD and boy, was I dissapointed! It is nothing like the SEX AND THE CITY! It is even more pathetic than the NANNY (if this is even possible). Save your money for something better!"
4,Absolutely Fabulous: Complete Series 1,This is a wonderful series. I always loved it and I was not dissapointed.
4,At Home At Work At Play,"This is the followup to the brilliant glam-rock excess of Kimono My House, which is an essential 70's album. Propaganda was written in the studio, a sort of brain-dump by Ron Mael of all the stuff that sticks in his head -- appropriation of british music hall and classical music themes, pun-filled juvenile/clever sexual innuendo. It has the same production values (bombastic excess), and a really really strong opening. But, if you want to buy just one Sparks album, get Kimono My House. If you want to buy a second one, get Angst in My Pants. If you want a third....well, you have a bunch of good ones to pick from, including this one.--hal"
3,"Pretty Good, But Quite Commericial","Spandau Ballet isn't a favorite group of mine, but there's no denying that they could write pretty good songs. Most of the material on this compilation I don't much care for, but there are a few tunes that are really good. ""True"" is a great song; well put together. Other notable songs are ""Round and Round,"" ""Only When You Leave,"" and ""I'll Fly for You."" The rest of the songs that I haven't mentioned are average. I mainly like the ballad material. These guys were very commercial and not very experimental really. Most of the stuff on this hits collection isn't very original. Spandau Ballet wasn't new wave; mostly just radio pop. I still think this compilation is okay though."
5,FISHER-PRICE COMES THROUGH AGAIN!,Good for development skills. I ordered this as a gift because it reminded me of F-P toys our children and grand-children have enjoyed.
2,My 1 year daughter doesn't try to collect it,"It is generally not interested in this toy.the first couple of days she folded part of each other and playing with balls, and then stopped. The parts are separated and connected by very tight for the baby, even adults need to take more comfortably. One year old child is not in principle be able to build a pyramid.however, only daughter is now studying to collect a regular pyramid. 'Maybe my daughter is too small for the toy, and she interested in it later?"
1,Disappointed in this toy so far...,"Well, we were so excited to get this toy because the reviews were raving, but it was a bit disappointing. Our 11 month old is just not so impressed. There are definitely better ways to spend money; try eeboo's tot towers which are beautiful, educational, and nesting blocks that WOW in more ways than one."
2,Kind of disappointed,"We have both this stacker and the traditional ring stacker from Fisher-Price. I would recommend that traditional stacker. While this toy allows you to turn it into multiple balls to play with, I guess my dislike of this toy is that my 1 year old can't get the cups off when you stack them since they lock together. So what's the point of the toy? At least with the traditional stacker he can practice stacking and taking the rings off himself. He loved the traditional rings when he was a baby too. I think this is a cute toy, but aside from turning it into balls to play with, it doesn't really serve it's original purpose."
5,Great Toy - BUY IT!,"We received this toy when my third child was born and have had it about 3 years. We now also have a fourth child and this toy gets played with A LOT! Many ways to play, if you are thinking about it, get it!"
5,Toddler loves these!,"I just purchased these after seeing them at a playgroup. My son, 19 months, loves playing with these stacking cups. He was quick to discover which color cups go together to form a ball. He doesn't care about actually stacking the cups only about making the five balls. Great toy."
1,Does not Work,"Pluged in to computer and Monitor and LG TV no output at all, reconnected many times still no output. Please Help"
4,A Late Dreamer,"This journal has information about his activites and duties as a Pop Artist. It will give the basic information. Keith Haring leaves you wanting more,but knowing that he is keeping many thoughts from you. Keith lets the reader know all that he wants you to know about his short life."
2,Wrong size,"Its a nice one, but it says the wrong size, I bought it as medium, but ist so big that is almost an extra large."
2,movie,love the movie. made me cry. I was expecting the original movie but it still is a wonderful story to watch
2,"Informative, but terribly unclear","As a computer science major in Brigham Young University, this book is required for 2 of my Sophomore classes. I am impressed by how much information this book contains. However, it is by no means clearly written. The wording is poor, the examples are vague, and the exercises are especially unmeaningful. Obviously, the author of this book is a computer scientist, but this shouldn't be the excuse for writing such a terrible book. Two third of my class hate this book, and we are thinking about having a festival to burn them together after this semester is over. we are asking for a better book which will hopefully contain the same amount of information, but better wording and examples."
4,Soundtrack,"I think this is a great soundtrack companion to a pretty good movie. ""Shine your light,"" played at the end of the movie, is an amazing and pretty powerful song, and the rest are pretty good too."
1,Hated it,"This movie is not anything like the television show, Diff'rent Strokes, which also starred Dana Plato. There is not one, I repeat, not one scene with Arnold or Willis or Mr. Drummond. Not one!"
3,Good example of the genre,"This review is for the R rated version on VHS:The films plays well, and for not having an 'unrated' label it's fairly generous with the skin. There are only a couple of good barefoot shots. The story line (yes there actually is one!) holds together pretty well, and the nudity is not the cheesy gratuitous kind; it all fits well into the story line. It would have got another star in the rating if they'd left a little less to the viewer's imagination, but hey... it was made in a more censor-strict era, after all."
4,Dufferent Strokes,"I thought Arnold would pop out at any time in the middle of one of their lesbian love scenes. If Dana was not dead I would have her as my pinup girl of the month. I would like have had some of the girl on girl shots go on a little longer but glad there was no male frontal because I do not want my kids watching that. Over all I liked the movie but I do not think it would be good for one to watch on date night because it has a feminine undertone that could be misinterpreted by ones love interest. I for one only got a cold pillow to sleep with after watching it with one of my laddies. Tip, watch for the Chito during the honey tasting scene."
3,Surprisingly Decent,"I checked this out largely to make fun of it and rag on Dana Plato (before her tragic death). It did not disappoint. First, it looks like it was shot with a camcorder, and the sets looked like it was the prop man's house. However, the lesbian love affair portrayed was actually sensitive, true to life, and quite insightful, despite dialog that borders on the ridiculous. It was convincing, and the nude and graphic sex scenes between Dana and the other woman were tastefully done. Overall, it's an absolutely ridiculous movie, that is not even any good to watch anymore to make fun of Dana Plato because she is now dead. She looked like hell warmed over in the movie as well."
3,First Apartment Stuff,"If you are thinking you are getting a bargain, you are. If you think you are getting high quality pans, you are mistaken. This leave me wanting my parents Calphalon set"
2,"If you need an inferiority complex, read this book!","All of the stay at home moms in this book are very affluent, and either had very successful careers high on the corporate ladder or in acting or modeling, or their husbands are very wealthy (ceos, doctors, sports stars, actors). While it would be interesting to read a few stories of women who formerly had great careers and decided to interrupt them to stay home with their children, most stay at home moms are not like that. This book made me feel like I have never done anything with my life. Just not very useful to the normal mom, although if you are a millionaire CEO you might get something out of it."
3,"Perfect characterization, but no plot to be seen","It was short, it contained good character building, it had an uninteresting plot.Not as good as I'd hoped, but you should read it anyway because of the insight on the character of Kathryn Janeway, wich repairs some of the damage caused by not-so-good plotting, short lenght and uninteresting side-characters."
3,Some Rants,"The MILPAS Highlanders who forged the original anti-Sandinistaforces crossed into Honduras in mid-late 1981 to obtainammunition. If the Honduran forces had simply providedthe rebels w/the supplies they needed, then there wouldnot have had to have been the CIA intrigue of creatinga counterrevolutionary force from the scraps of a defeatedarmy. The National Guard had been defeated in acampaign similar to the one the MILPAS rebels wereinvolved in.The CIA selected the Guard officers to lead the FDNmost likely for the fact that many Guardsmen weretrained or schooled in the US and had contacts withmany US military officers and CIA agents. TheHighlanders did not have any such advantage."
4,Working fine 5 months after setting up,"My mother's apartment is small and she was using up valuable counter space with a separate microwave and a toaster oven. I bought her this oven for Christmas and it's been working fine for 5 months. She uses both the toaster and microwave features frequently. In fact, she likes the way the toaster works better than her prior toaster oven. We had to place it on the counter rather than a higher shelf she previously used for her microwave because the door hinges at the bottom like a big oven rather than from the side. That's the only ""disadvantage""."
2,What happened??? Not like the usual Ms. Stone.,"Jean Stone is my favorite romance author and I have read every book she has written. However, with this book, I wondered ""What happened?"" This is not like Ms. Stone's usual books. Twice I tried to read this book and couldn't get even a third of the way through it. I kept thinking that it'll get better, there will be some excitement, but nothing. The writing style and story seemed too reminiscent of Barbara Delinsky, whom I used to like as a writer, but also grew tired of her books. This book seemed centralized on one character and Ms. Stone normally writes with 3 female lead characters. I kept thinking that someone else wrote this book, not Ms. Stone. Fortunately, I know that Ms. Stone will come out with more of the terrific books that keep my heart racing whenever I see it in the book store!"
5,Get Sponged,"This album has everything--great music, clever lyrics--what more could a fan want? I'm especially fond of ""Skinny"" but ""Try To Please"" and ""L'Amour/Le Guerre"" are also especially memorable songs. This one's a must if you're already a Spongetones fan but it's also a good intro to the band since it showcases what they do best!"
3,Gift for family member was underwhelming,Beautiful art; book cover not in such great shape as promised. Giving it because it also included a loose print.
1,BETTER BUY FOOD FOR HOMELESS DOGS ...Than to buy this magazine,Really nothingOnly adds and very cheap printingI feel sorry that I have a subscription on thatI should buy food for homeless dogs!!
4,Alec Baldwin doesn't love me ....,"Alec doesn't love me either, Ford and I are as one, this book is funny and filled with the crazy things that can happen to one person, it's an enjoyable and easy going read."
3,Not convinced.,"The author tried to present as fact that the Egyptian Divinities were not ""gods"" but did an inadequate job. But it did give valuable information."
2,Very strange edition.,"This is a review of the edition, not of the book. This edition is by BN Publishing. The strange, stiff cover, the absence of a copyright date, and the weirdly large margins lead me to conclude that this company simply photocopies editions that are out of copyright, slaps a cover on them, and then sells them to us. There is no forward, information about the author, or any sort of conventional book apparatus I would suggest finding another edition."
2,The content is great - I had read it previously.,"I chose the low rating because this editiion is so poorly printed. It is difficult to read, not a pleasure to read, and reading should be a pleasure. The publisher owes it to his public to plan this in the paper, ink and type. I was disappointed in my purchase.; I expected to receive a book I would read again and keep in my collection. I am trying to think of who I can give it to who will not be offended."
1,Wilder Publications is a scam publisher!,"Agree with the first reviewer. Wilder has taken the novel and chopped it up into a travesty of a book. Don't waste your money. Buy the Penguin or other classic edition. Wilder is an opportunistic companythat makes money from out-of-copyright work, desecrates it, and then puts it up as its own. Don't give them your money."
1,Buy this book--but not this one!,"Cold Comfort Farm is a wonderfully charming novel. But don't waste your money on this version! This version has been ""edited"" to Americanize it, and all it does is remove a lot of the charm of the original language. Buy a different copy!"
3,A little weird,"Not a bad read but cannot say that I was overly taken with the book. There are some weird and wonderful characters but for me the book was a little bit too far-fetched. Flora, the main character, is a force of nature to be sure, but why would a 19 year old orphan have such an impact on disrupting such an established family farm, whether a functional family unit or not. It is well-written though and I understand it is a parody, but for me it just had a few niggling credibility issues."
2,not as funny as the movie,"I saw the movie some years ago and thought it was hilarious. The book is just so-so; I only laughed two or three times, the plot takes 3/4 of the book to develop, and the lucky coincidences and favorable plot developments are piled on so thick at the end as to be a little absurd. Having said that, there is a part of the book that I couldn't put down- near the end where Flora's plots start to have good effects, but before the last few pages where the author seems to go a bit overboard."
5,"Work great, but have a break in period","This piece works perfectly. Takes a bit more work to get it in, but it gives you a solid mount. My car is vibrating like nuts at this moment, but I have only driven about 50 miles so far. It is a brand new piece of stiff rubber that needs time to soften up, so I have hope for this mount.Plus, anything that Anchor makes is a good piece."
4,GREAT!,"To put it simple, it WORKS! The belt clip is handy, so much better than having to go into your pocket, take out your iPod to change a song and whatnot. To sum it all up, buy it!! It's worth it if you are looking for a case and a stand all in one.^_^"
3,All Right Ok,"If you want the real Pat find yerself a copy of All Right-Ok .It was released in the early 80's.Have a few beers ,hook up your old turntable,and blow the dust off those old Bose 901's MIGHTY FINE."
5,Photography book...,"From Gymkhanas to the Olympics: How to Photograph the Common (and not so Common) Breeds of Horses & Ponies. Table of Contents Main Headers: Getting to Know Your Subject, Equipment, The Perfect Pose, Posing the Breeds, Getting in on the Action, Higher Class Acts, Western Action, Selling Photographs: Rights, Wrongs, & Records, Photofinish, Show and Sell With Video, Index. Lots of excellent photos! 154 Pages."
4,Krizia Uomo,"I use the one for woman and I just want my husband and I to have the same perfume, love mine been using it for long time, got very happy when I find it at Amazon. so far he like it a lot."
5,Great western CD,Good songs from an artist I have not heard of for a few years CD not being made anymore I was told but found a few on Amazon.
4,A good book but it's heavy reading,"A nice book. I learned that is is necessary to build up an attack from reading this book. Before ,if I had to attack, I used to rush into the attack at breakneck speed come hell or high water. However this book showed examples where you begin the attack, then rest for several moves in order to bulid up the attack, then attack again. Nice technique. I have incorporated this into my chess. The downside is that the book is a bit old (the examples are from the Capablanca and Alekhin era) and you have to work through the anotations. I would have liked more text explainations."
2,Full of mistakes,"This book shows good ideas and that is why it gets two stars instead of one. I put the analysis into my Fritz Computer Program and found one to two major mistakes in the analysis on almost every page - not just small mistakes, but big ones.I know you might argue that when this book was written computers couldn't be used to check how good the analysis is, but there are books out there with good analysis written before high powered computers could show just how bad some books are."
1,Unfortunately it does not work with all Dell PowerEdge w/ Solaris 10,"To put it simply, this product does not work. I have the KVM switch connected to 4 Dell PowerEdge servers running Sun Solaris 10 and the standard Dell keyboard and mouse. I previously used a 2-port KVM switch from IOgear on these same devices and everything worked except for the fact that I could only have 2 servers connected at any one time. I chose this KVM switch thinking everything should be the same but now I would have 4 ports. I was WRONG. The keyboard and mouse only works now with one server. For the other servers, the keyboard works during the BIOS startup but locks up when the OS boots up. It seems that I have to buy another KVM model that will hopefully work with my devices."
5,Amazing,To hear in a sweet afternoon... gorgeous songs. The main theme of this soundtrack is one of my top 10.
1,Very Disappointing on Win98SE,"This product claims to be supported on win98se. I installed the provided drivers, and still, nothing worked. I downloaded the most recent drivers from the iogear website, tried those, and still, didn't work. Meanwhile, these drivers screwed up my computer to the point where the display was wacky, and in general, it hasn't been the same since. I will be re-installing win98se from scratch this weekend to try to ""undo"" the damage done by this product/drivers.Also, the instructions in the manual apparently did not pertain to the cd of drivers they sent me. :-(Finally, I have to note that the box I received had obviously been opened and returned by someone else- I probably should have seen this as a sign of things to come!So, if you have win98, look elsewhere. I bought the SanDisk ImageMate; it installed seamlessly, and works perfectly, and costs less than the IOGEAR solution, too."
1,Think twice before buying!,"The packaging is cute, the thing is supposed to be fast, etc., but hey -- I couldn't plug it in! The power adapter they shipped simply didn't fit -- it was about 2 sizes too big!Tech support: ""Hmm. Sorry about that.""It's on its way back first thing tomorrow."
1,Not illuminating at all,"Yet another rehash of the Blair Affair, but with no new insights at all. The book is among the most boring of the seemingly endless ""media criticism"" books that publishers are churning out these days."
5,a modern all the presidents men,"i was given this book as a gift, and i didn't expect to enjoy it -- outside of all the presidents men, i've never read a book on journalism that really interested me. but this is a gripping and fascinating story. its more like a drama or a detective story than some book about media morals and it gave me a great look inside a weird and fascinating institution. i'd recommend it to anybody."
4,Positive,"A coffee stain on the spine, but what do I care? It was three dollars, and it was shipped on time"
1,Dis satisfied,"What have USA Today bestselling author's become? This is the first book I have read by this author and it will be the last. If this is called romance I fail to understand the word. Labelled as ""A Novel of Erotic Romance"" in very small print it left me wondering. The marathon sex scenes described were those between Lujan and his wife(poor thing) I would describe the writing as filth with no substance at all. I too skimmed the pages trying to find the story - do you suppose I missed something? If you want to read steamy seduction scenes well written read Stephanie Laurens' books. Any of her stories of the Cynsters or the Bastion Club will turn you into a new fan."
2,Waste of Money!,"I made the mistake of buying this book thinking it would be better than the last one. It's not. I love well written erotic romance ala Robin Schone or Emma Holly authors who don't feel the need to have the male lead denegrate and humilitate the female throughout the book. Nor is using the four letter ""c"" word to describe her on almost every other page. Yes, there's a lot of graphic sex but but I lost interest very quickly."
2,unsatisfying,The author failed to build any anticipation. The first kiss is not even identified. I don't mind good sex in a book. This was too much. I got bored with it and ended up skimming pages of sex just to get to the story which wasn't all that intriguing. I have no desire to ever read this author's work again
4,Pretty Good,"The sentences in the beginning of the book are very long. So long that you might lose track of what it is that you're reading ;). However, if you look past that and keep reading I'm sure that you'll find that it really does get better. The only bone I have to pick is with the love interest Rosa. She is a rather weak female character if you ask me. She's got the whole swooning thing going on, and while I realize that this book was written a century before a Women's Rights Movement, I'm still annoyed that women's characters were either conniving and murderous or swoony and stupid. Otherwise the story is quite good; you're totally rooting for Cornelius and his black tulip!"
4,Sooooo different!,"From the guy who brought you YEAH! YEAH YEAH! and ""Forever You, Forever Me"" comes this new edger side of Judson. I must admit, it did take several listens to really get into it. The stand out songs are: ""New Day Dawning"", ""Bossanovanight"" and the very cool ""NYC"". I hope that Judson Spence keeps up the work and puts out albums. I know he writes song for other people but I like the writer to sing his own songs. Waiting for some new stuff JUDSON!!! It's been awhile!!!!!!"
1,The book scents were rancid!,"The book looks cute, but NONE of the scents smelled like they were supposed to and they all smelled the same...rancid.The books have been sitting on the shelf too long!"
2,Smell does not last...,"It's a cute story. Not a classic by any means, but it is cute.The stickers do not last. The only sticker that still smells is the Christmas tree. This book has been packed away from January to November. Not used at all during that time. Again, only the pine has a scent to it.Very disappointing. Replacement stickers would be nice!"
2,Scented book doesn't smell,It is a cute story but the reason I bought it was because it is suppose to be a scratch and sniff book .The scratch areas don't smell at all not even a little very disappointing the kids lost interest right away and we didn't even finish the story .
4,Childhood memories,"I remember this book from childhood, and I know my son and neice and nephew will love it as much as I did. It is so simple, but it is a Christmas classic in our houses."
1,Not so smelly scratch and sniff,"I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. When it first arrived we enjoyed the story along with the scratch and sniff stickers that did initially release a scent. Within 4 weeks of first opening this book, most of the stickers had lost their scents. I must add that it had only been read about 5 times during this month. I noticed from the reviews that this has been a problem for many purchasers. The story is cute, but without the scratch and sniff portion, you may as well get a different Christmas book. I wrote a letter to the publisher to complain and never got a response. I would not recommend buying this edition."
5,Fantastic,"As always, Rick Steves never lets you down. Have toured almost all of Europe on Rick Steves' recommendations, with his luggage and phrase books for the languages that I don't speak - like Czech. Wonderful and a must have for travelers!"
2,no texts -- shame on you EMI,"This is not a gripe about Wunderlich, one of the greatest IMHO. It is about the EMI folks, who obviously think that song texts are irrelevant. Well, how do you know if the singing does justice to the text? And if you think that these texts are easily available elsewhere, I would be most thankful if you would share with me Lehar's ""Das Land des L""achelns"" Kalman's ""die Zirkusprinzessin"" or Neuendorff's ""Der Rattenf""anger""."
4,Arrived as advertised-Northern Helpful on Return,"Item arrived quickly from Northern when I ordered on 6/13/2008-- Unfortunately, I was unable to use the starter because of other issues with repairing the engine---When I used the instructions to return the product, I was directed to a very helpful and pleasant person at Northern, who arranged to have a return number sent to me so I could return the product to Briggs and Stratton-- About two weeks later the e-mail instructions came from Briggs and Startton and as of 7/14/2008, I am awaiting the refund."
3,"Good Latin, reggae, and ska riddims. But the rap is weak...","Overall, a good cd. Ozomatli has a great grasp of Latin rhythm, and they excel in this area. The reggae, ska and touch of Indian flavor enhance their sound further. But, the rapping, which is prominent on 3 or 4 songs, tries too hard. The raps try to sound tough and funky, and it just isn't on the same level as the rest of the music. They blend styles wonderfully, but the rap just stands out as weak to me. The group also comes across as self-important, mentioning their name many times throughout the disc. I don't need to be reminded of who I am listening to. 4 or 5 great songs, 3 or 4 sub-par. Overall, pretty good."
3,Track listing,1. Midori No Umi2. * (asterisk)3. Albiero4. * (asterisk) Part 2 [4 Beat Dub]5. Midori No Umi (Calm Dawn mix)Produced by Nobukazu Takemura
3,Reality for Bowie Fans,"Just letting you know beforehand , that for the US and UK Amazon reviewer's who are touting Bowie's great writing on 'Try Some Buy Some' and how it harkens back to his Aladdin Sane days, and is a beautiful ballad ---The song is by George Harrison.Read the liner notes.Then buy 'Living in the Material World' to hear the original version and wonder why the song was great to begin with."
3,Timeless Wonder,"I didn't buy this C.D. I gave that up after the Hours C.D. My wife surprised me with it. I said why waste 11 dollars for lousy music. When I first heard this C.D. I said to myself why does he even bother. Well after about 2 weeks now I like 5 of 11 songs which is incredable for todays David Bowie. His 90's c.d.s were complete crap. This C.D. is his best music since the 80's Bowie not Tin ""Can"" Machine. Bowie was more creative in the 80's with better songs and this C.D. is Bowies wake up from his Lost Weekend called the 90's. I think he finnaly captures what he wanted the 90's to be in one song Fall Dogs Bomb the Moon. He has some real crap though like Bring me the Disco King and Looking for Water. I look at the late Junk 70's albumbs like Low and Heroes and compare these songs with them. I hope he can finnaly score a hit it's been so long in the US. But most likely Bowie will be at the local County Fairs soon."
1,Reality Bites,"Preface: I am a die hard Bowie fan. I've seen The Man at least 10 times in concert (including the ""Glass Spider Tour""). Heck, I've even seen Tin Machine twice. This is just him phoning it in. My personal theory is that he is amassing money to build a space colony so he can prolong his life by living in zero gravity.Reality is a weak album, he didn't even try."
2,"""this book is boring me ****less."" - a comment to my wife","To be perfectly clear, I am glad I read this book. The problem is that I'm only glad to have read about 20% of it, the rest is stuff that I frankly could care less about. Now, there are people would appreciate the soap opera Weathers describes as the relationship between he and his wife deteriorates. You can find these people in the trash-novel section of your local booksture. The folks who browse the mountaineering section of said bookstore are more interested in the 20% that I was referring to above - The actual experience on everest and its aftermath, which is presented honestly and is quite intriguing. Even gripping. It has value. It is worth the $7. It is the reason why I gave this book two stars, not one. However, the majority of this book is a chore to read."
1,Left for Dead,"There was nothing compelling about this book. I expected much more writing about the actual climb and less about Beck Weathers personal family history. I don't care to know about such intimate details regarding Beck's marriage or what his children think of him.Also, I was amazed at some of the medical references he made such as not knowing you don't necessarly feel thirsty when you are dehydrated....isn't he a doctor???Honeslty, If I was climbing Everest, I would not want a person like this on my expedition...the eyesight, the lining under his clothing...some of this is common sense."
2,Don't bother with this one.,"I am about 3/4 of the way through and have read the constant bickering that took place between his wife and himself. We wanted to read his account of the tragedy on Everest and he wrote about 2 chapters worth (there are 24 or 25 total) on the tragedy. The rest is about his failing marriage. If I wanted this, I would have read an Oprah book."
2,Too Tabloid,"As an avid traveler and collector of books about travel, guide books, etc., my opinion of this book about a tragic yet fascinating time and topic, is very low. The book by Jon Krauker (sp?) is an example of tasteful telling of the tragic year. This book is more gore and bore."
4,Traditional Travel Guide,"This is a straight ahead travel guide, describing the kind of trip a typical American tourist might have in one of these countries. This isn't like ""Globe Trekker"" with a wacky actor and exotic activities, or like a PBS documentary about the countries. The host is very knowledgeable and pleasant."
3,Sent two left feet,They sent me two left skates and from reading the reviews this is a consistent problem. They need to incorporate some quality control. They did send a new pair of skates out to me quickly but my daughter was really bummed. My daughter loves the skates though and that's all that matters.
2,Not what I expected.....,"I bought these skates for my step-daughter for her birthday and when I received them, straight out the box they looked like they have already been worn. The sole was really dirty and I tried cleaning them and was not successful. The skates coming straight out of the box should not look like they have been worn. Not happy at all with this purchase.....:("
4,Very tasty,"I'm trying to get more whole grains in my diet, and try as I might, I detest whole grain bread. These crackers are a wonderful substitute - crisp and pretty tasty as well! I love them with cheese. The only reason I knocked off a star is once you unwrap the package, you really need to put the whole thing in a Ziplock bag. There's no way to reseal so they stay fresh."
5,This book was very good!,"This book was great. It told a real lifelike story of some of the things that teenagers have to go through to become popular. I think it really told a good story, and I think thst someone going through something like this could really learn a lesson!"
2,Not very realistic,"I didn't like this book at all. I'm in seventh grade and I thought this book was very unrealistic. I think the author was using a lot of stereotypes. The girl, Judi, said that she read seventeen magazine all the time so she thought she knew everything about fashion. She kept relating everything to seventeen magazine. She is supposed to be in eighth grade and she got depressed because she thought she should be on dates during the weekends. She also got depressed because she wears size twelve (she is supposed to be tall) and her friend wears sizes 7 and 8. This author should have talked to some REAL eighth graders before assuming they all read seventeen and want to fit ino tiny tiny tiny sizes!!"
3,Works well for only under a year w/ a PC,"I could not for the life of me get this working for a while, but once I did get to the web-configuration I couldn't get it to work with my existing wireless network. Although this was due to my stupidity, the lack of Macintosh documentation and software made it quite difficult to set up on my mac, and I might have been able to get it working sooner if it had this documentation. Finally, about a year after the year-long warrantee expired, it broke. I called customer service, and, despite what other reviewers have said, they were extremely helpful and tried everything within his power to fix my problem. But, the product was indeed broken and now I can't return it because it's beyond warrantee."
3,ok,I would like to find out as to where could I possibly obtain a copy of this book locally.I am fr the Philippines and would like to find out if I could buy this book here in our Country.Pls advise.
5,Another poetic view of flyfishing,"Emphasizing the feeling and beauty of fly fishing with some good, basic tips. Nice scenery, well made, enjoyable to watch. Well recommended. I think you can find free videos of Mel Kreiger on U-tube, to see if you like him. I did, and decided I wanted more."
4,"Good, but.....","It was evidently one of her earlier works. It was ok, but I think her writing has improved a lot!"
5,Spanish Crosswords,Bought this for an inbound older Hispanic lady friend to help keep her busy. She very much enjoyed it and could easily work on the puzzles while keeping busy and happy.
3,moha,"this game is fun, however you need a gamer computer to handle it, any computer with less than a 7 series gforce will not run properly, also needed is a good sound card.the game is fun and is a good addition to the series of metal of honor."
1,airborne medal of honor,"this game is garbage,if you base it on 82nd airborne combat jumps in wwII.the only thing that is historically correct are the name's of the combat jumps. the rest is all wrong, the locations of the jumps, the 82nd did not jump into towns and cities that looked like factories. brothers in arms is a much more accurate game when it come down to history.. maybe EA can do a better job next time .."
1,I Can't believe I waited months for this!,"I have waited for this oft delayed game for many moons. I would check the gaming sites for the latest news about a release date. I pre-ordered to get it sooner. What a disappointment! EA really dropped the ball on this one. I didn't think they could make a game worse than ""Pacific Assault"" but they did. It runs like crap on my computer that has a Pentium 4 duo-core, 2 full megs of RAM and a brand new GeForce 8600 GTS card. I set the video card and game to the lowest levels and it plays passably. I can't tell if the gameplay just sucks or if it's just running like crap. It looks like hell on these settings.The Game will not save checkpoints-My control settings mysteriously switch themselves around-I have not even been through ten minutes of the first level before I'm fiddling with the settings trying to squeeze some performance from the game-or I give up in frustration.Save your money-EA laid a rotten egg on this one"
1,Video card not supported? Seriously?,"I tried to install this game on a Samsung laptop made in 2011. I have the newest Medal of Honor game installed, made in 2010, as well as Battlefield Vietnam, made in 2004. So I figured installing this game, which is 5 years old, wouldn't be a problem. However, after finally getting the game installed, I received an error message saying that my video card was not supported. If my 2011 graphics card is too outdated for this game, I would like to know how the heck anyone played it in 2007. It makes no sense. I can run an EA game from 2004 and another from 2010 on my video card, so why can't I play one from 2007? Don't buy this unless you are absolutely certain that it will run on your system. Despite being an old game, it is EXTREMELY picky about what systems it will run on."
1,Chaep shooter - parody on MoH,"This is sucks-clone. First of all, it simple doesn`t work well, because there are a lot of bugs with the videocard. Patch 1.3 doesn`t include Patch 1.1 and Patch 1.2., so you have to download, download and download.Extremely poor designed everything from menu to gameplay. Colors are unrealistic and enemies are so ugly. The quality of sound, storyline and even graphics is worst then the MoH2 in terms of effects and weather (like smoke and water). You can understand that it is WWII only because enemies speak German, everything else is the unrealistic parody.The most important, that every time you shoot or injured, the screen is shaking and blinking. It is happening 1 time in sec. This is so painful for eyes and just danger. Never play this part!"
2,MOH has Improved1,"MOH games on PC and PS2 have been quite lackluster since ""Frontline""; but this game has really impressed me with the much improved graphics, reaching the level of Activision's Call of Duty series.The concept is well recieved, but I still do not go for the idea of keeping stats for head shots etc; along with the idea that every mission has certain quotas to meet as far as medals and badges are concerned; This I believe can be eliminated as far as I am concerned.As missions progress, the enemies are more difficult to ""eliminate"", at times taking a full clip from an automatic weapon before dropping, not to mention the ""super human"" enemies dressed in black! This takes away some of the realism with respect to weapon use.I find the last mission VERY difficult to complete, I've reached the last part of it and having a heck of a time completing it, and I am on the ""easy"" mode!!....If you have patience...you will like this game!"
3,Fun but too short and historically inaccurate,"This is a fun game with great graphics and sound but it too short and has some historical inaccuracies. A couple of examples:In the game, for D-Day, you are dropping during the day. In 1944 they dropped at night.The last mission is ""The Flackturn""; there is Castle Wolfenstein like super soldiers that first appear in operation varsity. It takes a lot to take them down and you have to plan and make sure you have plenty of ammo to do it. It is a fun mission but totally unrealistic.All in all it is a fun game and I loved the graphics and sound. I waited a while until the game was discounted and if you have the opportunity to buy it cheap - get it.At the end of the last mission, it ends with picture of a sky full of C-47s laden with troops escorted by P-40 Warhawks. The P-40 WAS NOT in the European Theater at the time."
2,"If you like 'Feat, skip this one","As a LONG time Little Feat fan, I have to put this CD in the same category with ""Shake Me Up""; skip it! There are many better Little Feat albums; ""Feats don't stop me now"", ""Last record Album"" or ""Time loves a hero"" if you're into Lowell George or ""Representing the Mambo"" or ""Ain't had enough fun"" if you like them now. ""Under the radar"" isn't terrible, but its not up to 'Feats normal standard, and contains many rehashes of old songs. I'd say they were just meeting a record contract obligation to put this one out. To anyone who gave this one a good review, please listen to the other titles I've listed above and then rethink what you've said! Sorry..."
1,Not recommended - jog dial used is awkward,This is my second rf remote. I purchased Keyspan model because of smaller receiver size (as compared to the remote from Mind Path). That was a big mistake - buttons positioned uncomfortably. Main button for advancing slides is on the side like Sony's jog dial. During my talk I could never advance slides forward. Not recommended.
2,Flawless... for just three months,"Teaching with a presentation remote is a declaration of freedom. No longer having to seat in front of the computer to flip through my Keynote or PowerPoint presentations allows for more participative discussion. The Keyspan's cluttered yet complete interface provides all the functions of the competition at a fraction of the price. Moving the cursor, flipping pages, laser-pointing... It's all there. Regrettably, it only worked for just three months. I even changed the battery (a very expensive and even more difficult to find 3v model) but nothing happened. It turns out the original battery was still fully charged.In conclusion: I can't recomment this product. I have now ordered the RemotePoint Navigator. Hopefully I'll be luckier next time."
2,Distance!,"This unit lacks basic functionality for plug and play. The buttons are designed to be ""left"" and ""right"" clicks. This is fine... Unless you want to go back a slide using PowerPoint or keynotes.Other basic presentation remotes offer the different key functions making presenting easier for all parties involved."
5,Easy to use!,Easy to use! We use Macs but have Power Point presentations we need to run. This was easy to set up and very easy to use.
4,Great product!,"This has really helped me with my business presentations, so much better to be able to move around the room and not have to worry about aiming the remote at the USB connection, which is what you often have to do with a wireless mouse. Very cool design as well."
4,"Professional, Easy to Use","Have done many presentations with this, and it works flawlessly. The button operation is very subtle so your audience can't even see you advancing slides. Laser pointer doesn't show up great on all screens, best to bring a backup."
2,Didn't care for it.,"This album wasn't what I expected. Only one song I recognized, and the rest were OK, but no great find."
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"This is a real nice bracelet, the problem is where the shiny part meet the matte part. The line seperating the the two is very rough, some parts that should be matte is shiny & some parts that should be shiny is matte. For a bracelet to list for a price of 400.00 should have showed better Quality & Craftsmanship. I should have returned this item, but I dont have the time nor the patience. I notified Netaya by email about the problem, but I got no reply."
1,"Garbage, tried twice, twice warped",First board warped and began splitting within 3 days - after oiling it every day. Replacement did not fare much better. Garbage. Not worth the hassle.
1,SO small!!!,This cutting board is REALLY small and not durable - I bought it about 2 months ago and it has already broken in half.
4,This Is The end of a Good Series,Hellraiser: hell On Earth is when the good series ends and all the [...] load movies are started. It is a great movie not up to the levels of 1 or 2 but still is good. Too bad they didn't release the un cut version because that is better then then R rated one. The unrated has more gore and is about 5-7 minutes longer then the R one. A good movie and it is the end of a great series of movies.
4,I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.,"Even though this was not the best sequel of the bunch,it's still pretty good when you think about it.The script was some what simplistic but the action and gore really grab you by your feet.The special effects are good and the acting is decent.I really like the different cenobites in this movie because they are really original looking.Over all,I would recommend this to any fan of the series.I WILL TEAR YOUR SOUL APART!!!"
3,What started in hell will end on earth,"Hellraiser 3 was really good, but nothing compared toHellbound:Hellraiser 2 or the original Hellraiser,Kirstythought she ended Pinhead when rescuing her dad, yearspass and then someone solves the puzzlebox that the ghoulishdemon was trapped in.As pinhead gets out he needs blood. So thenhe kills a couple of people to become immortal. Pinhead then becomes regenerated. Then Kirsty finds out, and throught all the pain and suffering she's been through had finally ended. She teams up with Joey to end Pinhead, but Pinhead isn't so easy! As in Hellraiser 2 Pinhead has a little assistant fiend that willhelp banish Kirsty and Joey and finally do what Pinhead does best: Raise hell on earth!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"THE OTHER TWO HELLRAISER MOVIES WERE SO GOOD. SO ORIGINAL. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PIECE OF CRAP THAT CAN GO ALONG WITH THE FRIDAY THE 13TH MOVIES. PINHEAD AND THE HELL RAISING CUBE RETURN, ONLY THIS TIME INSIDE OF A STATUE-LIKE FIGURE. OHHHHH SCARY. THE CUBE IS ONCE AGAIN PLAYED WITH AND HELL IS UNLEASHED... YA DA YA DA YA DA! ALSO THE TITLE ""HELL ON EARTH"" IS A BIT OF A LET DOWN. SKIP THIS ONE AND JUST WATCH THE FIRST TWO. THEY WILL DISTURB YOU BY THE CLEVER CREEPINESS, THIS ONE WILL DISTURB YOU BY THE HORRIBLE ACTING AND STORY!RATED R FOR: VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, AND A SEX SCENE."
4,Good Book of Ireland,This is a good book for an overall trip to Ireland. Very useful information. I would recommend this book to anyone going to Ireland.
4,Recommend to any parents to be!,"This is a great book. Like it says it covers just about everything you need to know about the babys first year of their life! Might not be a good review, but if you dont know what to expect with your newborn this book is a must."
2,Not reliable,[...]Support from D-link is sketcy at best.You will spend more time configuring the product than going over to the other room and printing it directly from the desktop.
2,Not Compatible with Vista Business 64 Bit,"I got the D-Link DP-301U Ethernet Print Server from Fry's about a month ago and was not able to get the supplied CD software to install. I was trying to use the software on a Lenovo X301 Laptop with Windows Vista Business 64 bit. As a result, I returned the item.The product packaging has written on the outside of the box ""compatible with Vista"", but does not specify which version of Vista. Using such imprecise verbiage, in the broader sense, suggest compatibility with the both the 32 and 64 bit versions of Vista as appose to one or the other. At the very least, it leaves open ambiguities.This sort of loosely worded product claim and packaging is either sloppy and or unscrupulous marketing.Minus 1.5 for Ambiguous Product Claim and MarketingMinus 1.5 for Not Compatible with Vista 64"
2,I read it,"But because it was for a child (girl ) perhaps another storyline would be more delicate but was not aware of Hairy Maclary I will be more careful in my choice of story lines, I heard the title on Coronation Street so will be more diligent and choose more wisely. Looks like a good children,s book though.I am a bit out of touch with children,s books Thank you"
5,Love this show!,It's too bad the shows aren't longer or that there are so few. We loved this show so much I purchased the digital season 2 to watch again!
3,"A ""must have""","This DVD is a must for new and experienced casters. It's a codification of the book, which is considered to be ""the bible"" of fly casting."
3,Definitely for the beginner,"I thought that I'd never find a book that could teach a purely HTML literate person Perl, but now I've found one that could teach an 7-year old! This book claims that you hardly need to know HTML to learn Perl through this book, just how many people want to dive directly in Perl CGI without having HTML dialed...come on! Several chapters are wasted, such as How to Create a Form in HTML and lengthy explainations on using Fetch and WS-FTP(""double-click on the WS-FTP icon.."") Otherwise, easy to follow and well written. Excellent for a true beginner. The book in 270 pages, not 302 BTW."
2,Pass on this one,"I dont care how many kids you have or how long you've been programming for, this book just doesn't cover the subject of Perl very well. The author needs to include more info regarding simple unix/linux file manipulation rather then building an HTML form. Also, whats with the tiny little diagrams and pictures? I wonder what Larry Wall would think of this book? I think I just tossed 19 bucks!"
4,For new programmers focusing on web apps,"This is one of very few Perl books that 1} focus entirely on CGI 2) don't assume you already know Perl, and 3) don't assume you already know another programming language such as C++."
