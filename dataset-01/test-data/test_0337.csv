4,A pleasant surprise for someone who never Picked Pickler,"This album is far better than I expected. I'm an American Idol enthusiast and while I admired Pickler's drive, I was not impressed with her singing. I never voted for her and was rather pleased to see her voted off. But this album takes her back to her element -- country, but fun country. (I also wouldn't consider myself a country fan.) So she is back where she belongs and is clearly comfortable.Some songs are cliche, definitely. But some are surprisingly sweet and meaningful, particularly My Angel and I Wonder, which are about her grandmother and mother, respectively.I'm glad I gave Pickler a chance!"
3,Not Enough Singing,"It is obvious listening to LL CDs that Eligh is very talented, and I was resultingly hyped to get Enigma, which I had heard was his best CD. If that is true, consider me disappointed. Most of the CD is filled with odd beats and background music and repetitive melodies, without any trace of Eligh at all. I realize that some people enjoy that type of thing, and if you do this CD is for you. But if you want to hear a CD full of the Eligh that you just can't get enough of on Classic, this isn't where you'll find it. I'm disappointed."
1,Samsung Software,"This is just about impossable to get it to link with phone, and you cant get any answers from Samsung."
5,DVD of Fats Domino,Awesome dvd! I like the conceret. Where could i get more Fats Domino live concert dvd's?
5,"No coasters, if you please","It's so nice to find a company with integrity. No longer do I have to be concerned with the ratio of good discs to coasters. They all work, and that's that."
5,Very Happy,I was so worried about which disk to get. I had heard so many do not play with certain players. Now I only buy Verbatim and TDK. They always burn they always play.
1,Four discs so far = Four coasters :-(,"My experience with Verbatim goes back to 5.25"" floppy disks. I've always had a high regard for their products. That opinion has changed, though.These DVD+RW discs, the first I have used from Verbatim, exhibit a much higher number of write errors than any DVD+RW disc I have used. My DVD software then times out on the write, the OS notes a write error, and I get a warning that the disc is unreadable/unwriteable. Cannot be reformatted or used in any way. The first three discs off the spindle blew up after a few writes. The fourth disc lasted about a month before it developed read errors.Verbatim claims a warranty on their dics, but I doubt that many people take them up on that, as it's an enormous hassle. Better that the discs just work in the first place. These discs obviously don't.Since storage media must be reliable, I won't be purchasing Verbatim DVD+RWs in the future."
3,Works fine but a little slow,"The disc speed is 4x instead of common 8x or 16x, it is a little slower than expected. However it will work"
3,Vebatim let down,"After trying Memorex, Sony and other, I decide to give Verbatim a try. The first disk out of the case would not format. I have also had play back issues with other disk after only one recording."
5,Marvelous Read,"Cody and Tessa's romance seems so star crossed yet you will root for them. The character's, the setting, and the plot are compelling. The sensual scenes will make you crave more. This book is a keeper to be read and reread and savored."
4,"This is only intended to prevent ice jams, not to remove ice and snow.","This controller only turns on when it detects liquid water, and the temperature is above freezing. That will prevent ice jams, but doesn't remove ice and snow. This wasn't clear from the product description."
1,I am searching for a more reliable product,"Installation was easy. The unit worked great for 2 season and then failed completely half way through its second season. I was going to give it one more try. But, now that I see other comments from consumers who had the unit fail as well, it sounds like mine failing was not a fluke. Great product if you want to replace it every year. For over $100 I'm not willing to do that."
2,Roof Coil Control,"The cable control only came on one time, usually the sensor is under snow or ice and will not sense moisture. I normally plug the roof coil in directly in the mornings when the weather is going to be above 30 degrees to melt the roof ice and snow. I probably would not purchase another RS-2 automatic roof de-icing cable control it does not work very well for Wisconsin winters."
4,Good Brit Witchcraft Film,Interesting story of African withcraft in Britain. Some suprising moments make the movie interesting.
4,"Works very well, but overpriced for what it is","I was very surprised when I opened the package and saw that this is basically a T-strap with D-rings. It WILL NOT WORK if you don't have your top tether and LATCH straps with it. We found that out the hard way when we accidentally left the LATCH strap behind and tried to attach the car seat to the suitcase. We were able to improvise and use a camcorder shoulder strap though.It does work really well. It just hooks over your suitcase, through the handle, and you clip the top tether and LATCH hooks to it. It's nice because you can then set bags or other lighter objects inside the car seat while pulling the suitcase, to help free up hands.Like I said though. For what it is, it is WAY overpriced. With a strap and a couple of metal rings, you could make this at home for $5. However, it is worth the money to save the hassle of carrying the car seat yourself (which is probably why they get away with the overcharge). :)"
4,Worked great then slipped-help?,"The first leg of the trip, this was a miracle. Everyone in the airport stopped me to ask me where I got it and how it worked. It allowed me to use the restroom in the airport without fear of my toddler running around touching all the icky things in the bathroom stall since he was strapped into his carseat. The question I have is that when I put the car seat on during the second leg of our trip, the car seat slipped down and dragged on the floor. I had to pull the carry-on almost parallel to the floor (in a very awkward way) in order to get the car seat not to drag. It became so frustrating that I just gave up and carried my son in my arms. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, do you have suggestions on how to fix it?"
5,Life Saver at the Airport!,I had a six hour lay over at the airport with my two and a half year old son. This strap was perfect for my trip. He loved riding and seeing everything and he even took his nap while being strolled in his own car seat. This was a simple yet wonderful invention.
2,Good idea but not necessary,"We needed to transport 2 suitcases, a diaper bag, camera case, a stroller, 2 car seats, a 3 year old, and a 9 month old to/from airplane/car and with only 2 adults, I wasn't sure how we'd manage it. I saw this and thought it would be perfect to strap one of the car seats onto the larger suitcase and have the 3 year old ride in it. I read the reviews and saw someone said they just used a strap and got some other piece from the hardware store and did it themselves. Being frugal, I figured I could do the same thing but couldn't quite envision what the other person was doing. We ended up using a cargo strap and it worked out great! My son loved riding in his seat through the airport and we managed to get everything to/from airplane/cars without an issue.I gave it 2 stars just for the idea."
4,Does the job!,Was very nice to use this on the trip with my son. Made it so much easier. I have a Britax marathon. I have suggested this product to many friends!
4,LOVE IT!,"I chose not to put my toddler in this, but still used it to transport her car seat. I was disapointed on the trip there... the seat dragged and I was sure I would never be able to use this with my daughter (Which I intend to do on our next trip). On the way home I acidently left the car seat in the recline possition! I am glad I did! NO DRAGGING!! And it still fit perfectly! Can't wait to try it with my daughter in it! (note- we have a Britax Blvd. It is a big and bulky seat and long (that may be why the seat worked best w/ this in the recline possition!"
2,Blaah,If you are looking for something quick and easy to use this isnt it. Bought this for my last trip to FL and ended up giving up!!
2,"Good idea, not very applicable","Unless you have a very sturdy carry-on (and I mean VERY sturdy), this item will ruin your luggage.The idea is good, but car seats with kids on them tend to be quite heavy, and our 80$ samsonite carry-on was almost ruined after using this for a couple of hours. The wheels buckled outwards because of the weight added, and even after unstrapping them, it wouldn't run as smooth anymore. I guess luggage are designed to withstand a certain load in them, and adding that much unbalanced weight can make them fail, which is what ended up happening.It is also expensive for what it is. You can mimic the same behaviour by just getting a ring, and strapping the car seat hooks on it (2 sides, and top hooks used to lock the car seat in position in the car).I give it 2 stars for the idea. It might work to just move your car seat around and not have to carry it, but definitely not with a toddler in it (my daughter was only 1 when we tried this)."
4,Good item IF you have the right card seat!,"We ordered this, but didn't pay close enough attention to the description. It requires a car seat with LATCH straps. We erroneously assumed from the pictures that the accessory came with some sort of buckles. It does not. Your car seat should already have the buckles there, referred to as LATCH. We learned a lot about car seats from playing with this. Sadly, we learned it would not not work with our car seat which was a baby bucket style Keyfit 30.The strap itself was solid, durable and I have no doubts that it would hold the right kind of car sear pretty firmly in place."
5,Perfect solution,This product really works. I traveled for the first time by myself with my 21 month old and he loved it!
4,"Easy to use, works well, torques a chintzy suitcase handle","We bought the strap and at first sight, I thought there was no way it would work with our 30"" Britax Marathon car seat and 22"" carry-on. We tried it out this evening and it works, pulls along and all that good stuff. However, since our little guy was sleeping, we put the 25 lb dog in the car seat and the carry-on handle started seriously torquing. Not sure I'll feel safe putting him in it with such a chintzy handle."
5,Worked great while travelling alone with toddler,"It was very easy and quick to attach and detach the carseat to the carry on. I highly recommend this to those who travel, especially alone with a toddler."
1,travel nightmare,"i bought this hoping it would make traveling from bwi to houston easier with just me and a 2 year old. it was a nightmare. i can't really blame this strap, but it is not very long and you have to tilt the arm very far down to walk when using it so it's impossible to walk comfortably. also, in the pic it shows pushing the seat like a cart, in reality you have to drag it behind you because when you exert that much force to push suitcase, seat and child, the handle automatically slides back into the luggage. i wouldn't recommend this for anyone traveling alone. pulling that around is a job all on its own."
2,Must disagree...,"I found this book to be a fairly difficult read. It's poorly laid out, generally, and is written in such a way that the reader becomes more and more bemused as he works his way through each chapter. I'd be amazed if anyone has managed to work their way through the whole of this book..."
1,This book is a waste of time and money,"It is unfortunate that Hopcraft and Ullman have been referred to as authors. Not only is the text indecipherable to anyone without a Ph.D., but the examples do not apply to the exercises and the exercises are not conducive to learning the material."
5,Finally Feminism Uncovered for its contemporary uselessness.,A great book! Finally someone blaming the real culprit on why women are confused and...my heart be still doesn't use men as a scapegoat! I hope women of my generation and the next read this book and realize that there is an alternative to modern feminism! I hope I someday meet a woman who agrees with Mrs. Crittenden.
1,"This is 1999, isn't it?","My friends and I just passed this book along amongst ourselves; it was a 'gift' and did we ever enjoy it! We're having a party this weekend, and we plan to use 'What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us' and 'A Return To Modesty' as kindling for our bonfire. As far as we're concerned, these books are poison to young girls."
3,Where the men are,"Honest, serious men who put their careers first but their girlfriends or wives a close second can be found in the Objectivist movement. Read a novel by Ayn Rand and introduce yourself to a local group of Objectivists which will almost certainly be 80 - 90% men."
1,"Do as I say, not as I do","The author claims that the path of female happiness is husband, children and home-making, while she herself doesn't seem to notice that she is a working mother. The benefits of achievement, accomplishment and economic independence she's chosen for herself are exactly what she's teaching other women to deny for themselves.There's not one path to happiness for all women; neither is the choice simply 50s-style family life or male-modeled power success. Instead of this book, try books by Harriet Lerner or ""Love, Honor and Negotiate"" by Betty Carter for a more balanced view of attaining happiness, fulfillment and intimacy."
1,CRAP!CRAP!CRAP!,"As a ""modern woman"" of 29, I sure don't believe the author's crap about why happiness is alluding me. She tries to scare us into finding a husband while we're still 20-something and sexually appealing before we become 30-something pathetic, desperate losers sitting in fertility clinics or living in sin with pathetic, desperate loser men who will never marry us."
1,not very good,"It would be easier, as a stay at home mother, to take this book seriously if I thought the author followed her own advice. If she wrote a book and edits a paper she is working full time. I also thought the way she rips apart women throughout her book is appauling. She consistently bashes the movement (the work of those old women in the park) that provided her the opportunities she now has as a writer. The feminist movement happened so women could choose what they needed to do as individuals and be valued for it. I choose to mother full time and the author obviously does not. Without the feminist movement I would be the only one feeling fulfilled in her occupation."
5,Loved those sparkles,You should have heard the laugh of pure delight when my daughter got these. The quality and workmanship were perfect. My daughter wears these to school every day.
5,"Chin ""home gym"" purchase","The exercise wheel arrived in a timely fashion, thank you! And just how did the shipper know that that blue would be so perfect for his little ""split level condo""?!! ;D"
2,No for Guinea pigs!,This item is a big no no for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs can injure themselves in the wheel by constantly having their back arched. The same goes for those giant hamster balls people try to put them in. If you have a huge hamster this is great but don't use it for your guinea pigs.
5,Custard and Clamsause!,"I read books extensively. Occasionally I'm fortunate enough to come across a excellent piece of prose such as this book. Esoteric but enormously entertaining. The way it is structured constantly keeps you turning pages. Neal builds a ""Alice in Wonderlandish"" world where what you can expect is the unexpected. You get a chance (that you don't get in other novels) to visit a place you've never been before. In the case of this book...a very strange place indeed. The inside of Mr. Barrett's head must contain contain a amusement park for the eccentric."
4,How very very strange and wonderful....,"...this is a thrill ride into the strange and bizarre world of Mr. Neal Barrett Jr. and what a wonderful world this is...It has a lot of ideas that I haven't seen anywhere, and even though it seems a bit weird and at times childish, it is... but it is also its strength.I would like to say something about what the book is about, but it would take some of the fun out of reading it... so I won't.Enjoy it!"
5,UPCUT SPIRAL BIT,You will pay a little more for this bit but it is worth it! Very smooth cuts in both hard and soft woods and plywood although I prefer the down cut bit for material with a veneer. You really do get what you pay for so don't be put off by the price.
4,Good basic guide for karate practicioners,"For those entering the shotokan karate world, here is a basic, yet detailed and authoritative book for developing their karate in the right way. It explains everything, from appropriate state of mind, through breathing, and to the training of basic techniques and main combinations, in the form of comprehensive lesson-like chapters. It lacks one important point, though - the teaching of all Katas until Blackbelt; if not for this, the book would have got 5 stars. The Kumite forms are shown in another excellent book from Shihai H. Kanazawa, ""The Complete Kumite."""
5,hella sicca .com,"Dude, this split is so sick. It makes me want to ""smash computers"" and take Ritalin, because I hate God and love. Post power-violence emo/hardline 4 life. They should have been called Jet Crisis. It's really too bad they broke up, 'cause now I'll never get to see them rock the house. i've never even made it past the jetlag half, because it is so good, but i've heard from a friend, well some guy really, that it was great too."
3,A bit fragile,"While my almost 2 year old son loves this book (as he loves all maisy books/videos), I have had to put it away because in his desire to pull the tabs and make things move, he is constantly ripping the pages or the moveable parts. The parts are just made of regular paper, not more sturdy card stock as you find in other pop-up/pull tab books. A fine book if you have a gentle reader, but if you have one like mine, who loves his books to pieces (literally), this is not a good choice."
5,Gave as a gift,"Arrived in good shape. Can't comment on content, as it was a gift for my sister in law, who has great taste in music!"
3,hard to get fully charged,The directions say to charge for at least 3 hours or 3hours and 30 minutes...doesn't work. Yes youget to watch a little bit of the movie then it cuts out off on you even when you've charged it for it's time.nice that they give you a sampler but I would not give it a all around 5
4,good book,"The author brings up several useful points that are not inherently obvious. I would reccomend this to anyone, regradless of level of eduction, who wants to make a convinving point. I take off one point because it would have been useful to see some sample essays, or sample outlines."
1,terrible,this is a terrible toy I had to throw it out the first day. The paint peals right off of it. It like a latex paint that doesn't adhear to the canvas under it. It just came off in many pieces.I would not suggest this for any dog. What a waste and health hazard.
3,book of Genuine Risk,Short and simple. Disappointed there wasn't any personal stories of involvement with this amazing mare. Had great pictures. Liked the ribbon for saving last page read.
5,For the fan of Columbo,If you are a fan of the detective then you will enjoy this movie. Enjoyable in the true Columbo style.
4,At least it's still Columbo.....,"I should begin by identifying myself as a diehard fan of Columbo. I end nearly every day with an episode or two and I'll continue purchasing these collections till I own every episode / movie. Having said that, I agree with a previous review that stated that Columbo belonged in the 70's and should have stayed there. Sure, I guess substandard Columbo is better than none at all, but these later episodes (anything following season 7) pale in comparison to seasons 1 through 7. Weak loose scripts, D list guests stars, MAJOR continuity errors, poor acting and terrible use of music all fly in the face of what the original seasons brought to the table. While I'd rather watch a bad episode of Columbo versus a ""good"" episode of any modern cop show any day, it's still a shame that the high standards weren't upheld."
3,Columbo: Genius At Work,"These movie versions weren't as entertaining as the ones made during the years the series ran, but if you love Columbo they are still worth watching."
5,Columbo,"ALWAYS a favorite sleuth and great story-telling! Good to have them on DVD at last. Close to the best of all mystery dramas on TV, but the Miss Marple series is equal to the task."
3,these were toward the end of the run,"Sadly, Peter Falk is looking quite his age in these. The impact and charisma of his Columbo don't shine as brightly as earlier episodes.But who cares? We all love Columbo."
3,Symptom Of A Bigger Problem,"Yup, I can definitely see what some people have been saying for years. Power metal has become bland and generic. Unfortunately, I've heard a lot of that lately in several CD's I've bought. This one at least has a cool cover.The musicianship is good and the singer has the pipes, but the compositions are so bland that after my requisite four listens, I cannot remember a single thing about this album. I mean, it's not horrible by any stretch. It is just nothing to write home about either. These guys have so much talent and technical ability. Maybe they need to get some outside songwriters to help them. Maybe they should also mix things up a bit for variety.Only recommended for the die hard power metal fans."
3,"Good product, but start-up is difficult","My kids had a Geosafari 20-some years ago, and it was one of the most-used toys in the house. It's grows with a child, as you can purchase increasingly difficult and varied cards. The only problem we had with the new one I purchased for a family member this past Christmas was that a series of codes must be entered every time you play a card, in order to set the amount of time that will be allowed for you to answer, the number of players, etc. This must be done each time you switch cards. This was difficult for the 5-year old I purchased it for, even though he was certainly able to work out the problems on the cards themselves and enjoyed doing so. I wish this unit would allow the parent to set these parameters ONCE and have them stay put unless a change is desired."
4,really good bargain,I rated this product as a 4 because Im not quite use to the size I did expect something a litte larger however Thay are a great bargain
1,Canon brand way overpriced...,"I originally purchased one of these batteries as an extra for my Canon 30D. However, after receiving it, a professional photography recommended getting non-branded version from a different website. The price of those non-branded versions was $8 each, I returned this and ordered 5 of the others for the same price as one of the Canon's. The non-branded batteries have been working just great.This is one case where I personally chose to skip the Canon brand...most everything else I have is Canon branded."
5,Great Battery!,"Great Battery. Got it for my Canon 20D. Used for a wedding this past week in North Carolina where I took over 1000 pictures (preceremony, formals and ceremony) before changing it out. Battery meter still showed full charge but I thought it best to change before shooting the reception events."
4,Good but expensive,"Seems to be original Canon battery. As such, it is somewhat expensive. I can't help but wonder if an aftermarket battery would do the job?"
4,Worth the extra money,"I've tried using aftermarket batteries with my 20D, and none lasted more than a year, while the original Canon battery still works fine. So, I decided to replace my replacement battery with the Canon one. Yes, it's still a bit pricey, but it works better than the cheaper ones."
2,Nothing really new or worth knowing or watching.,"She discusses working on the movie, with the director and how great it was. Fodder for hyping the movie.The movie was very good, you can skip this short video however."
4,I love it,"I originally got into Big Sir because of Pet, a band featuring two of the members that now comprise this group. Of those two members, one is the vocalist, Lisa Papineau, who is close to the most compelling lyricist and singer I've ever come across. Although Pet was more along the lines of metal-alternative-whatever, the LA-based Big Sir has a lot of trip hop to their songs, which is currently my favorite genre of music abreast trance techno.This is an intelligent remix album featuring a variety of charismatic interpretations. For example, ""Fuzak"" has a harder hip hop element fused into the chorus that works (completely). My makeshift favorite is ""g7"" but this release definitely possesses the strength required for repeated start-to-finish playings. If you are into variety, pick this up."
5,great recording,Like on their recordings of his quintets Domus does a beautiful job here. These two pieces are from earlier in Faure's life than the quintets and so are simpler and perhaps more easily approached. The piano writing is great and beautifully played by Tomes. Strongly recomended to fans of romantic era chamber music and to fans of western art music more generally. The recording quality is up to the excellent standards of Hyperion.
5,Marmite,"I love this stuff having grown up in Hong Kong, then a British colony, we ate this stuff like water. It's an acquired taste though if you were not brought up on it. Spread it thin over bread and butter. Delicious!"
2,"too flimsy for car camping, too heavy for backpacking",This thing leaks. I ended up throwing it in the garbage awhile back after a couple of uses. I've gone back to using 2 plastic washtubs that don't take up that much more room (assuming you use them to store stuff in them).So for car camping I would go with something sturdier for sure.
3,in the middle,"I have searched high and low for wash basins. When I saw this one I had to have it. I will say that it's not the best in the world but then there doesn't seem to be many alternatives out there. I still prefer this over bringing two tubs. Yes you need two people to carry it when filled or you will have a huge mess. Yes sometimes it becomes soft but I find that if you put it on the metal bbq's most campsites supply it's the right size to hold it in shape. I like the big pockets and we wash all of our dishes in it when camping. I will continue to use this product until I can find something that 1) packs down to almost nothing and 2) has two bins so that you can wash and rinse. For those who have totally bashed it, what do you expect from collapsible PVC?Bottom line, it's cheap and compact and works for our family."
1,not the best material,When we opened the product there were splits in both sides. We could not even patch it since the hot water made it too soft for the duct tape to stick. Not worth the $15.
3,The Landlord a real campy movie,"I had expected The Landlord to be scary, and in many ways it is. It is also rather campy.I had never thought a bunch of demons to be so funny and in many ways stupid. And that goes for the landlord himself as well."
3,DONALD REVIEW2,AFTER RECEIVING THIS ITEM I WATCH IT BUT DID NOT LIKE IT WAS NOT MY TYPE OF DVD LIKE HORROR REAL HORROR MOVIES. I WILL KEEP IT THANK YOU AGAIN.
1,Two hours of my life i can never get back.,"What a joke. This book was being given away in the Free box at a local rummage sale. No wonder. I wouldn't offer this crap to a salesrep at an Amway convention. Honestly. Crap. Complete crap. Who is this guy and why would they publish this? It is so bad I am in pain. The stories are not funny, poignant, or moving. They are barely made up of whole sentences. Apparently the signed copy wasn't much of an inducement to keep this, as mine is also signed. This may be the case for book burning. I've read better spam mail than this no talent ass clown can ink out. If there was a lower rating than one star, I would have gievn that."
5,Find this book and read it,"This was my favorite book for quite a while. I read it while I was young, a teenager. I don't like it any less now, but I am no longer dealing with the same issues and don't think about it as much. It is to Sturgeon's credit, though, that every reader review here has given the book the highest possible rating. He was an enormously underrated American author; better than anyone else in SF and as good as any American author of the 20th century (though to appreciate his skills, you'd have to read more than just Godbody). Fortunately, his short stories are being collected and released, the first five volumes being available currently through Amazon. As for Godbody, it is available in libraries (particularly in big cities), in used book stores, and through used book searches. Email me if you have difficulty finding it."
2,For Sturgeon enthusiasts only,"The only dissapointing Sturgeon work I have ever read. If this is about to be your first taste of Sturgeon stop! and read one of his many other books/stories first. Although it covers his common underlying theme of human relationships/love, it does so in a tedious, pseudo-softcore manner, which I found boring and ultimately unreadable. I give it 3/10 in sympathy."
3,"Nice game, but not for beginners!","This is actually a nicely made chess game with a handy touch screen for piece movement. The menu system is a bit convoluted, but after figuring out where things are and reading the instructions a couple of times, you can find things okay. My main complaint about the game is its level settings. At the very lowest level (Beginner 1), the game is still quite difficult for an intermediate player to beat. I would say that the lowest setting equals about a 1500-1600 rated player. This immediately puts this out of the reach of true beginners and children. They will get soundly beaten every time and likely become frustrated. This game would receive a 5 star rating from me if the lowest setting was more like a 400 rated player. Maybe they just couldn't pack that flexibility into the AI?"
4,"Good, sound advice.","This is the first book I have read on casino gambling. I am a novice gambler and I found John Patrick's advice to be solid and sound. He wants you to make smart decisions and not expect miracles. There are no gimmicks, no empty promises. He has little tolerance for a loser mentality and is uncompromising on what he thinks is the right or wrong way to go. I will continue to go back to the book as I play more and more because there are many different strategies and I can only absorb and put into practice so much information at once.I just got back from Vegas and I cannot report that I came home with more money than I left with, but I did go there with some parameters to begin playing with and enough confidence to step up to the craps table. Hopefully the dice will be hotter during my next outing."
3,Disappointing.,Not a great start to the 'Grace Valley' trilogy. I was expecting to love 'Deep in the Valley' as I couldn't get enough of the 'Virgin River' books but there was no comparison.Basically the book is nothing more than an introduction to the people living in the valley. If you're looking for something similar to Jack and Mel's story in Virgin River you'll be disappointed. There wasn't a love story worth talking about and there were so many secondary characters and their stories that it was hard to keep track of who was who. I would have liked to have seen more of Jim and June together but he only appears 4 or 5 times throughout the story.Having said all this I won't give up on the series yet. I'll try Book 2 to see if there's any improvement.
5,"though a bit outdated, still worth reading!","The q/a format of this book is well done and the diversity of views about bears, even the 'post' bear and even some who just look like a bear but don't even subscribe or buy into it and some who deeply embrace it is really fantastic, fun, and an easy read and highly recommended. It also has some good history."
5,go buy it now,"Seldom seen but often heard, urban legends carry with them an undeniable mystique. In the rap world, Skatterman & Snug Brim are Kansas City's urban legendsThe album is a collection of street stories,Everything is being told from an urban aspectThe celebratory, feel-good vibes of ""Block Party"" notwithstanding, the rest of the album sustains a largely serious tone. On ""Car Wash,"" Skatterman & Snug Brim detail the sometimes shocking events that transpire at Missouri car washes, while on ""Murder By #'s"" they swear by the code of the streets. Elsewhere, the rhymers give multiple meanings to street slang on ""Pakman"" and blast fake rappers on ""U Not Mafioso.""""Crazy,"" one of the album's standout tracks, features Skatterman & Snug Brim rapping about the monumental struggle in their own lives. The captivating, compelling cut gives each rapper's story a personal, vulnerable perspective rarely heard on rap songs.On the whole the CD is worth the money and a must listen to the lovers of music."
1,Impractical Guide,"This book does not appear to be good for beginners or professionals. It does have details on constructing ponds, but it is seriously lacking in the `care and feeding' of koi. This area is covered conversationally and although the important topics are mentioned, it does not provide details. So it is not a practical beginner's guild. Nor does it provide technical details such as chemistry or anatomy that you might expect in a professional's guide.I liked the photography. However, if you are looking for a book on pond building or koi photos, there are better books than this one on either subject."
5,Gilmore Girls - Season 7,"The 7th season was a little disappointing, as it was the last one, but I loved it anyways. Best show ever!"
4,Only a shadow of it's prior self.,"I LOVED the Gilmore Girls. Had watched it every week, watched reruns whenever I could and purchased each and every season when they came out on DVD. This last season was really a disappointment. I do say however that at least the series finale somewhat pulled it all together, in the little time they had when no one knew if it would be the last season or not. I am still hoping for a 2 hour movie that would really let us see what the characters are up too. If not I have to just tell myself that Loreli and Luke get it together and Rory is a famed writer somewhere!"
5,I love this ENTIRE series to pieces!,I wish this show didn't end. I'm watching and rewatching the DVDs all the time just so I don't miss it so much. My most favorite show EVER! And that's saying a lot! You must get the whole series. There's no doubt about it! You'll be friends with the most lovable characters on TV-land. You'll love them so much that you'll wish your town could be just like Stars Hollow.
1,What Happened?,"What happened? Gilmore Girls was my favorite show, until this season... Nothing happens. That wit and charm annd dialogue that made me smile is now gone! The plot line is awful, although I am happy that Luke and Lorelai are talking again. I hate Chris.... he's such a wimp. Same with Logan, sweet and cute, but a wimp. I have all six other seasons, but this is one that I am hesitant to purchase..."
1,Holy Crap this is the worst ending to a show ever!,"Holy crap could this have been any worse? I mean seriously breaking up Logan and Rory on the second last episode, why? Never really getting Luke and Lorelai back together, ridiculous! Finally can we think of no better way then to send Rory away so that she basically won't see her mother for like a year? If it was up to me, Luke and Loralai would have gotten married and so would Logan and Rory and then Rory would have gotten the NY Times job, and that wouldn't be the best ending but at least it would have made the long time viewers happy, rather than show us this sub-par crap of an ending."
3,series,I bought this box set of the Gilmore Girls but have never watched it myself. My daughter loves the series since she has all the other ones.
2,Gilmore girls you fail me...spoilers included.,"Seasons one through six are great! I don't know what happened in the final season, however, it is the opposite of great. The season feels rushed and choppy.Lorlei takes off to Paris with Chris to dump Gigi off with her mom and then they decide to get married?!? Luke and Lorlei continue their love-hate relationship but it is more strained than ever. And Rory decides NOT to marry Logan?!? Come on! Lorlei and Rory's relationship seems distant and not as quippy as the previous seasons. Overall, I did not enjoy the final season."
4,Some unresolved questions but mostly pretty good,"The final season of this enjoyable ends with some unanswered questions: Will Luke and Lorelai ever hook up? Will Chris stay away for good? Will Jackson and Sookie ever stop having kids? Will Michel ever get a life outside of the inn? Will Kirk remain the Stars Hollow oddball for the rest of his life? Will Taylor ever get over himself? Will Paris drive everyone insane in her quest to become a doctor? Will Lane ever get to go on the road again?Also, it never made much sense to have Lorelai and Chris back together. And Logan should not have put Rory on the spot the way he did.However, this is still a very enjoyable final season for a consistently good show with rapid-fire dialogue and quirky characters."
5,best season yet,"Season 7 of the gilmore girls was all and everything it should have beenEverything finished up nice and neatly, with bittersweet and unexpected twists but perfectly in keeping with the life and personalities of Lorelai and Rory and Emily and Luke (oh luke just do it) Sometimes at the end of a series you feel like you have to cry but this ending was just right The end of one life as 'the girls' with all the possibilities of what might happen next in their futures..best of luck to them"
3,"Good, but not great","One cover review called this the best book ever ... not sure I'd go anywhere near that far, but it was good enough. I wish it had explained more of the background of the universe the book took place in (there was just enough to get the gist), and it had a nice plot twist at the end. Maybe I'm just not well-read enough, but many, if not most, of the classical references were lost on me. I was able to read this on a trip from Charlotte, NC, to Burlington, VT, with a storm delay in the middle, so even if you're only mildly interested, it won't take long to get through it."
5,By no means an average ST Book,"I certainly agree with those who think that this diverges from and doesn't fit in to the ST universe properly ... perhaps largely because a lot of it appears to view ST's preoccupations ironically, and ST fanatics don't seem to share the book's gentle satirical fun at some of ST's stuffier side. But I have to say it has been one of the most enjoyable ST books at all, probably thanks to its distinctive flavor ... somewhat diluted from Somtow's classic sci fi trilogy of the 1980s."
1,Forget It!,"I feel bad rating this book so low because I hate to give anything ""Star Trek"" a bad rap. I can't honestly recommend it to anyone with a clear conscience. There's not much to say good about it except that it had a good concept which might have been delivered more aptly by someone like Peter David. Unless you feel you've just got to read every Star Trek novel - skip this one!"
2,Misfire,"There is some potential in this novel, particularly with the discussion of Thanet's religious beliefs. That potential is lost amid a sea of ambiguity that detracts from the overall story. The writer could have done a better job with it but missed the opportunity."
2,Not at all what expected,"This item is much thinner than you would expect, and is not made of a textured rubber like most jar openers. It is more of a slick material that has a raised design on it in attempt to help in gripping (I say attempt, because it hardly works). In the photo, it looks as though there is a design in black on the opener, but the actual item is completely white and only has a raised pattern on it. Worst of all, this item smelled horrible on arrival. I had to wash it several times with scented dish soap to make it even tolerable to have around. I would definitely not recommend this product."
3,Loved the style but too tight!,I loved the style of this shoe and how they looked on my feet also. They were too tight however and I even tried stretching them by wearing them on the carpet for several hours all total. I was worried that they would still hurt my feet so I returned them. I see that others have the same complaint so I wish Aerosoles would make the same pair but widen them a bit.
5,Fantastic!,"Even if you are not a great clarinet fan, this CD is a must-have. Thea King plays a basset clarinet, a reconstruction of the instrument for which these pieces were written; it has a richer tone and several lower notes than are available on modern clarinets. Because Mozart called for the full range of the basset clarinet, performances on modern instruments involve re-writing of the clarinet part; King brings us the notes that Mozart really wrote. Mozart achieves an amazing spirituality in the hauntingly beautiful slow movements of these works. The Concerto is wonderful, but the Quintet is a real revelation, and is alone worth the price of the disc. King handles the technical demands of the music with aplomb, all while playing with great feeling."
5,best seller,you are the best seller. thanks for the fast shipping. Also the book is very clean. thanks
4,Good stats book,Very informative stats book. I don't like the fact that not all the odd numbered problems's answers are not in the back of the book.
4,Does What it Says,I feel as though I have now been thoroughly introduced to statistics. This book could not have fulfilled it's promise any better.
5,Mounted,Good service & quality.. On time and as advertised.Will continue to buy online due in part to the quality products & service.
2,Garmin 60 bike mount,Be careful with this mount. Use the lanyard as a backup. GPS can and will come loose from bracket. I also use 2 Livestrong bracelets to hold gps in place. The mount broke in two last weekend an inch & 1/2 from top. Just ordered a replacement. I hope Garmin has improved design. This bracket was purchased 9 months ago. It has aproximately 2000 miles of road bike use on it. The Garmin 60 CS is one tough unit. It has hit the pavement more than once and only has a few scatches.
2,Not strong enough for mountain biking,This unit is just not strong enough for mountain biking. I had a minor crash and the top of the mount snapped off and my Garmin fell on the ground scratching the plastic cover which covers the LCD. Garmin does not repair but charges 110 dollars to send you a refurbished unit. 110 dollars to replace a 15 cent plastic face plate. No Thanks. they also claim there is no engineering problem with this mount.
1,Don't Bother,"If you have a high end road bike, don't bother to purchase this bike mount. It won't fit on the handle bars. I tried this mount on a couple of road bikes from different manufacturers and they all had the same issue - this Garmin bike mount was too small for the handle bars. The adjustements for bar size are very limited.There is an ""oversized"" mount you can buy from Garmin that will work on the larger bars. However you have to buy this kit AND the oversized mount. What was Garmin thinking?"
4,FYI,"I'm posting this in response to the previous reviewer's request for knowing which tracks are the ""extras"" not released on the earlier 10-song anthology; it occurred to me that others might have questions about this as well. The extra songs are tracks 2-4, 7, 11, 14, and 17."
1,"Terrible, no insulation so it will burn your kids!!! Very dangerous for a home!","there is no insulation, if you have kids then you should post the trauma/burn hospital telephone number next to the toaster, of course not to close or it will catch on fire.....My old piece of junk toaster with a screw missing is still better than this...I am taking it back after one day..."
2,Toast on fire from defective switch,"I read the review below before buying this toaster oven and ignored it because I loved how it looked and loved the removable tray. After about a year the problem below started to happen. The toast switch stayed in the on position and my toast kept burning and burning. Thankfully, I caught it before it started a fire. I should have listened.""We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the ""Always On"" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke & a toaster full of flames. You were warned.Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product.Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse."""
2,Slow as molasses.,We received this toaster oven as a gift. It replaced our 10-year old inexpensive Black and Decker purchased from a large retail store. (Toast-R-Oven Classic)[....]This is not worth the money in my opinion.-Takes forever to toast and you often have to preheat the oven 5 minutes before toasting.-There is not a removable crumb tray to clean out the bottom of the oven. This makes it difficult to clean.
2,"It started out OK, BUT...","At first it was fine- a little slow to toast, but very even toasting, etc.And it looks great on the counter in my designer kitchen.But at 12 months and 1 week, the timer had the same problem that many other reviewers mentioned- bell stops working, then the heater goes off, and worst, back on!In DeLonghi's defense, they agreed to have it repaired. (After a little negotiating)And it worked again. This time for 10 months, when the replacement timer did the SAME THING!And again, after some negotiation, DeLonghi has agreed to repair it. Again!So, Maybe DeLonghi has learned its lesson on customer service, but they either should recall this thing as a fire hazard, or redesign the darn timer!"
2,the toaster that doesn't toast,"looks nice but DOES NOT TOAST! for baking function, takes a while to heat up adequately- thus totally defeating the point (in my eyes) of a toaster oven."
4,Great for keeping cords from tangling,"They should call this the year of the cord! I have a box full of cords for all kinds of products, and tangling is what its all about. So I've been looking for easy to wrap items. This one is definitely the easiest. Bulky, so you can't fit many of them in a box, but I did ask for the medium size I think. Don't remember, but it works really well. No winding and winding, or unwinding and unwinding. You place the cord in the center and just turn it like you are closing a jar, and it winds up inside. So easy to unwind as well. I recommend this product for a wide variety of cords. And the price is reasonable for someone like me who hates to see things messy in a drawer."
3,A good HIGH-IMPACT workout,"You will get a great fat burning workout with weights from this video but it does have some high impact aerobics. It is about 65 minutes long. You need light weights and ankle weights. If you want to buy a Firm workout tape, I recommond the FIRM Total Body - Body Sculpting Basics with Susan Harris for a better over-all workout with weights with less impact on the joints."
4,combines a lot of the moves that even most new workouts have!,"This is my most favorite workout video and I have many. Despite the annoying dancer bodies, neon colors, eighties hair, and Janet Jones perfect barbie doll shape its the only workout that combines all the moves I need for my curvy womanly shape with cardio. I like how they incorporate stretches several times throughout the entire workout and have a long stretch at the end, it helps combat the soreness. The workout is very hard, harder than it looks and its very effective."
3,She goes too fast - you need to concentract on weights,I have learned that when you are using weights you need to go slower and stop at the top and the bottom of your movements - not just fling the weights around. The leader - Janet Jones - goes so fast with her weights that all you can do is fling them around. It is a very challenging tape but does not have very good technic.
5,Older video but definitely does the job,"I started doing this exercise tape when I was in high school (18 years ago), and I LOVE it. I wish it was on DVD. I agree that a lot of things have changed in the exercise world since this tape was originally made, but it remains the best workout video I've ever done. If you stick with it, you will DEFINITELY notice a difference in your body in 10 workouts."
3,Not exactly low-impact!,"For the most part this video IS low-impact, but during a section of the aerobics she goes into jumping jacks and running among some other high-impact moves. When your feet leave the ground at the same time it's high-impact!It isn't really much in the aerobics, pulse raising, arena either. There is only about 20 minutes to get your heart pulsing. I would alternate this video with one that gets you into that fat-burning heart rate for a longer period of time if you are trying to lose weight.All-in-all, it's an okay video. It does legs, abs, arms, and it is definately Total Body."
2,Broke not long after purchase,"This broke all by itself, by falling off the windshield and then hitting the dashboard breaking into pieces not even a year after it was purchased. Unfortunate to say the least. The cord which is needed to be kept in, to keep the GPS on as it's plugged into the lighter really got in the way of this holder too."
3,my sermon upon this mount,"It took me a while to figure out how to use this mount for my Garmen GPS.Getting the GPS into the mount was a struggle. Once I got it figured out - I was OK but it is never easy.There is a suction cup that you stick onto your windshield. You put it in place and then press a little lever that increases the suction. The little lever - I'm sorry to say: ""sucks""The flat portion you press with your thumb or other appendage broke off. I can still use it but that little lever is a design problem."
4,60 CSX Mount,Actually connected it to a beanbag base till location decided. This swivels all directions so you can get it out of the glare. Good Product.
4,like it,The style of nipples one chooses to use is a personal choice and can't really say if one is better than the other.
2,"An ""unwise"" choice","As a longtime fan of John Michael Talbot's music, I was looking forward to owning the ""Wisdom"" album. But it has proved such a huge disappointment, I wish I could return it. (Am thinking of giving it away ...) Usually, the great thing about his songs is that they're very sing-able. But on the ""Wisdom"" album, most of the songs neither rhyme nor contain choruses that repeat. They're basically sung poems from the Apocryphal ""wisdom"" literature. And frankly, they all sound alike and aren't very interesting, musically. ""The Cross is Foolishness"" was the only track I thought was lyrical and more like his older work."
1,Cinsha,I was looking for the English version and I had to read through most of the dialog. If the English version is available I would interested in purchasing it.
5,Fluffy and nice,Our little girl of 14 months just loves to hold this fluffy cloth book. She will also soon learn the content and it will help her to speak. Good going Roger Priddy.
5,Baby's first cloth book,"This was our baby's first cloth book. It has easy-to-touch pages. We helped him reach out to touch the 3-D animal-parts and soon, he reached out on his own. We bought the cloth book with the turtle on the cover - thinking the baby would like it just as much. He doesn't seem to be as engaged with this one."
4,ANOTHER HITS ENTRY WITH A DIFFERENCE,"According to a music selling magazine this CD is #24 in their top 40 best selling CDs--and they offer thousands of CDs for sale. Quite an accomplishment. This is due in part that not all the songs are Connie's standard hits but various tunes she recorded over a decade and a half including a sophisticated ""Walk On By"" brilliantly performed. There are other suprises for those who are not terribly familiar with the availability of her catalogue. This is a nice UK entry. Clean sounding with a nicely chosen selection of songs. It's quite evident that the UK still holds Ms. Francis in high regard as do other forgeign lands. Now if her own country had the same respect, we might see some nice CD releases here."
2,Detroit's Sports Broadcasters,"This book is promoted as follows: ""...takes the reader behind the scenes, tracing nearly 80 years of electronic reporting"" and, ""Recall Detroit's great sports moments through the eyes and words of the legendary Ernie Harwell, Van Patrick,"" etc.This can lead one to believe that interviews were done with the announcers, but that is not the case. Instead it is a picture book with relatively short, uninspired captions accompanying the photos. Usually the only information given is a list of the stations the individual worked for, and the span of years that he or she worked in the market.The choice of pictures is also odd, as there are ten photos of George Blaha, yet no pictures of a number of notable broadcasters, including Gene Osborn, Tom Johnston, Tom Hemingway, Ann Doyle, Red Jamison, Mel Ott, Don Watrick and Harry Wisner, although most of them get a passing mention at the end of the book."
4,Spidey Fights Kingpin,"In volume two, Spider-Man continues to hone his skills as he battles Electro and the Kingpin. The story and writing are some of the best I ever read in comics. You cannot put these books down, they're that exciting and riveting. I really would have hope the illustrations are just as mesmerizing but they're too campy, slick, air-brushed looking art and is probably the only thing short of me giving these books a perfect rating. Gwen Stacey makes her introduction in this issue but she is no longer the 'good' girl."
3,Read the description before you buy,"This TV is exactly what it says it is. It is an ""HD-compatible TV"" with SVGA capable display (800x600 resolution)in 600 lines of resolution, normal TV is 480 lines.So for those of you crying about it being 'false advertising', pay attention next time to the description of the product. Anything above 480 lines is HD-compatible, with true HD starting at 720 lines up to 1020 lines of resolution. A SVGA display capability is 800x600 for a computer monitor and that is what this TV gives. 1280x720 is XVGA. RCA also does not claim this is a Widescreen format (16:9), so the 4:3 format while better than normal TV is not true widescreen so the black bars will appear still on DVD widescreen pictures just less of them.All in all, this TV has a GREAT viewing angle, GREAT brightness and candle power ratings, and is ranked high among similar brands (those being HD compatible digital LCD monitors.)"
4,Managing Transitions,One of the best books I have ever read for understanding transitions within the workplace and its applicable to your personal life as well!
5,Hidden Jewel,"Every once in a while I try out an artist I'm unfamiliar with and am pleasantly surprised. Examples are Nancy LaMott ""Listen to My Heart"" and Andrea Marcovicci ""Just Kern"". Finding Debbie Campbell was another of those ""wow"" moments. Her style is smooth and her interpretation of these standards is wonderful. She seems to stick close to home but I'd love to see her in the Oak Room at The Algonquin in New York for a long engagement! The bottom line is get the album, sit back, and enjoy."
1,All the right songs. . .,"I bought this album because I love all the songs on it and it is hard to find them all on one album. Alas, I should have listened to it before ordering. Debbie Campbell's interpretations of these songs is just plain terrible. It's not that she alters them with a jazz interpretation, she just plain changes them, warbling all over the place. Often she rewrites the melody completely, without any understanding of what the song is about. I was hoping for an updated version of songs like 'Some of These Days', a song about a woman pumping herself up and strutting her stuff, but Debbie Campbell is no Sophie Tucker."
3,Durufle Requiem,"This recording was disappointing. The Requiem - one of the most beautiful choral pieces ever written - is well done but, for some reason, the organ is painfully out of tune with the rest of the ensemble. That may not spoil it for some but it did for me."
2,You all are wrong,"All of those people that gave this cd 4 or 5 stars must not have heard either of his 1st 3 cd's. Everything after and then there was x was a poor attempt to make some money. His 1st 3 cd's all were good. This cd does have some good songs, but overall, I am once again, disappointed by dmx's attempt to make good music after and then there was x. It shows in his record sales."
1,def jam promotes animal abuse,DMX is an animal abuser. Don't buy this album and boycott Def Jam records until they stop glamorizing dog fighting with albums like this.
4,"""Sunshine of the Night""","There is a reason coleman fuel lanterns used to be stamped ""Sunshine of the Night""; they blast away at the darkness with retina-searing levels of light. Truly impressive, dead simple, and cheap to run.The new northstar line may put out more light but uses harder to find and $$$ mantles. I say stick with lanterns that use the old tie on mantles (#20/21). While you're at it, stick with liquid fuelers instead of propane (""profane""). Yes, you have to pay attention when working with a liquid fuel lantern but it's excellent practice for life itself. Teach your kid how to operate a lantern safely and change his/her life for the better.My oldest Coleman lantern is 48 yrs old at this point and I still use it weekly. I don't know if my new one will last that long but if it does it will outlive me."
4,Love story,"""Not my Dog"" is not great literature, but it is a darling story. All adults and most children have at some time wanted something so badly that any substitute falls short. Ellie wanted a puppy and when the family took Great-aunt Margaret's dog because she could not have him in her new apartment, Ellie was broken hearted and knew in her heart that Preston would never be her dog. But as happens, Preston turned out to be special."
4,Excellent Film,"I saw this movie a couple weeks ago in a theater here in Dallas, Texas. I was disappointed the movie did not draw a big turnout considering it was only showing for one week.I found myself on the edge of my seat and frustrated at times. Linh (the female character) was disillusioned and seemed quite ""out of it"". She obviously had something on her mind! I initially thought she was abused by her uncle. It all came together towards the end when Linh's mom told the true story.I normally do not cry when watching movies, but this one hit it home for me. Enjoy the movie!"
2,Finger Stuck,My stepdaughter's finger got caught as well. My husband pulled her finger out and it was injured badly.
5,Great find!,"My son loves this book and was thrilled to get it for his eighth birthday. The description of the product was accurate, and the text itself was in much better shape than the copy that we have so often checked out of the library. Definitely worth the small expense."
2,A terrible continuation of the series.,"While and after reading this, I was disgusted. This wasn't good, and I wasn't happy with it at all. I am really hoping that Marilyn Kaye gets her act together and produces some better ones - I have only liked five of them so far."
2,Sorry but I didn't like it.,"Told me stuff that weren't true.like elephants can fly.that's what/how rediculous some of his ""research"" is."
4,Not an Easy Read,"The author's choice of words and the way his writings flow make it a difficult read, best taken in small bites. It doesn't read easily like Scratch Beginnings or How to Survive Without A Salary. Keep a dictionary close by while reading. I really enjoyed the book but I wasn't able to tear through it as quickly as I would have liked."
3,Eh. A little too much like her other novels,"Don't get me wrong, I do like Helen Ketteman. In fact I look specifically for her books from time to time. But this book.....it was a little too much like her others, or if the other is backwards: perhaps they were too much like this one. I felt like I was reading ""Luck with Potatoes"" all over again."
3,More description needed,"This portfolio cover arrived as scheduled via UPS. I was surprised it did not include the writing pad itself. The description is a bit misleading: ""a zippered enclosure holds an 8.5 x 11 notepad,"" and a picture with a pad...oh well. The outside has white top stitching along the edges, something that is not shown or mentioned. If I had known I would have chosen another, as I prefer black stitching on black leather; it's a bit more elegant."
3,"Disappointing, But Sporadically Interesting","Coming upon a book entitled ""The First Historians"", recommended by various scholars, I was excited. The questions that came to mind: Who were these historians? When did they write? Why did they write, and for whom? Unfortunately, none of these questions is even addressed. There is considerable analysis of parts of Judges, Samuel and Kings, and a lot of scholarly wrangling. If you're in the field and have strong, already formed opinions about Noth, Van Seters and others, and are acquainted with the jargon, this book may be more useful to you than it was to me. Still, there is a certain amount of unusual information about the texts and iron age Israel."
4,A good Start,"While this book isn't for those intressed in Basic Wicca. It is a very good book for those wanting to take it to the next step, and create a Grimoire or Book of shadows. This is not the here's a bunch of spells type of book, it is a way to find your on voice and create your own spells and rituals, which is a far sight above and beyond most books written on the subject of Witchcraft."
5,Revolutionary. Will change the world ?,"I am thoroughly and overwhemingly impressed by the book. For a recent few years I had a latent desire to find a book such as this one, which is scientific in its approach. Bingo. I find it and I am overhelmed by it. What a book ! I am on the road to implement its suggestions. Must read for each and everyone and more than that, a must do for everyone"
4,Great for Hypoglycemia,"I tend toward hypoglycemia, and am naturally addicted to sugars and ""hi-density"" carbs. I am thin, but am worried about developing diabetes as I age. I was skeptical about the Zone diet, since it cut out or way down on my favorite foods ... but after just one meal, I felt balanced and had NO CRAVINGS for sweets! Without any prompting from me, my husband had the same reaction after his first Zone meal. We're convinced!I agree that Dr. Sears ""proof"" and supporting statistics sound overblown, and the book reads like pure unadulterated hype. But the program works!"
2,"Dr Sears isn't in great shape, so why follow his advice?","I have a huge problem taking fat loss advice from a man who's not in good shape. I tried his diet, but after about a month on it, I became very tired and I only lost one pound. I was eating 12 blocks a day (based on my active lifestyle that was how many I was supposed to eat). Get advice from a lean personal trainer or a fit nutritionist."
1,I hated this book!,This book is filled with too many rules and is a difficult book to follow. Please consider one of the less expensive low-carb books like Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution or the Carbohydrate Addicts book.
1,The Zone,"I gained 4 lbs in one week on this diet. This is just another fad diet like many others and hard to follow. If you want to loose wait read the pioneer's book on the subject ""Dr. Atkins New Revolution Diet"".You do not have to count cumbersome blocks of protein and blocks of cabohydrates in the Atkins diet like in the Zone."
3,I found it too hard to follow,"I tried the Zone diet some months ago and sometimes I felt so hungry I had to quit the diet. I did measure everything to make sure the proportions were correct, but it didn't decrease my food cravings unfortunately."
4,This book is not as good as the Fish Oil Book,"But one thing that it does have is some specific examples of recipes of things that you can eat.It was nice to have concealed the chemical/ biochemical garbage and left it for someone who wanted to buy the original Zone book, and demonstrated some realistic recipes. Or, should I say, realistic proportions. Most people would never eat this stuff anyway (at least not as he suggested it).But what he takes a fair number of pages to say is that if you just eat the 40-30-30 way, then you should be all right. And, in his Spartan, approachable writing style he gives you the pitfalls of a lot of common bad habits (some true things on the nature of exercise routines, etc).What he makes the most clear is the things that you should NOT eat (which happens to be almost everything that tastes good), and WHY you shouldn't eat it.Dr. Sears is probably laughing all the way to the bank with this book."
3,For kindle...,"This is the only purchase for my kindle, so far, that causes t to lock up. Once you get to the back of the book where the appendixes are it lock up so I can't jump from hater to chapter. I would purchase a paper copy of this book so you can more easily move around to reference things."
2,"Cranky and Skinny, but not drowsy","My SO started with the Zone diet and immediately lost about 10 pounds. He was thrilled. But then he lost another 10 and couldn't put them back on. Every time he got just a little teensy bit hungry he would become a nightmare of crankiness. When his triglicerides dropped to 1/4 the level they had been he was thrilled. Given his uncontrollable weight loss (he now looks eerily skinny) and the horrible mood-swings, I question the quality of the life he has choosen. If I had to feel that way every day for the rest of my life I wouldn't want 10 more years.In Barry's defense, I try to eat Zoneish at lunch. It really does seem to help with the mid-afternoon crash I was used to feeling after a big lunch.Good luck to you all."
2,"Good idea, but too complicated","I purchased The Zone diet book a few years ago in many an attempt to loose weight. While it was part of the ""low carb"" diet craze and does provide some good insights, it's too complicated. Everything has to be eaten in percentages, and your diet has to be limited from the bad carbs (bread, pasta, sweets, etc.). You need to limit portions, eat fruit and vegetables, and not live so strictly, otherwise you will be unhappy."
1,It frightens me that this book is a best seller,"I am a physiologist from Seattle, WA and the ""zone"" that this book is referring to is called Ketosis which is when your body isn't getting enough carbohydrates -- it is commonly seen among women with anorexia. It scares me that this book is a bestseller and that people who don't know better are going to follow this advice. Please check with your doctor or your local library for more information about Ketosis -- it is a very dangerous thing to do to your body. The ""zone"" is a sickness - not a way to become healthier. If you want to lose weight - exercise and improve your diet."
4,Nice,The book was in good condition and the subject is dealt with in a decent manner. I look forward to learning how to card weave.
5,Perfect for those knowledgeable in Tablet or Card Weaving techniques,"This is the perfect book for anyone who has some knowledge of Tablet or Card Weaving, although I suppose the craftier among us might find some helpful tips as beginners."
3,Does The Job,"I've had the Yard Bug 3 years now and can report that it's a pretty nifty little mower. Great turning radius for tight spots.....like around trees, etc. Not very fast, but fast enough for our half-acre of grass. I did have to replace a belt and a battery. Cuts evenly; lawn looks good when you're finished. Having to lift the blade to go into reverse can be an irritating safety feature, but you do get used to it. I can mow both front and back on one tank of gas. Of course, before this I've only used power mowers, and this is a far sight better than those. Over all, a nifty little bug that does the job."
2,avid boater,After two trips fishing one of the the t-nuts has pulled out of the mounting plate. At the price I expected something a bit more solid. I would not buy them again nor suggest them at the price. You would be better off with another product. As for the extra wide size they are narrow I would hate to see an adult try to sit in the regular size.Sad and out a lot of money. Seriously considering shipping them back since the product is defective.
5,tried and true,These boots last for years and are a must for anyone who spends time outdoors regardless of the weather. Good value.
4,Good boot for winter and mud,"This boot runs a little wide. Great boot if you have to get muddy, just don't plan on any long walks your feet will pay for it."
1,Mixed Value,"The book adds little to what is easier and more thoroughly gotten from help screens.It does not note several serious flaws such as the imposition of the Master Document template on subdocuments as they are inserted. The result can be disasterous reconstruction of the format of the imported document.If you have subdocuments formatted under separate templates or under Word 97 there is no way to recover the desired formats. Microsoft tells me that Word 2002 will correct this problem. In the meantime stick with Word 97.If you wish to use a Master Document, create the Master Document first and then create the subdocuments using the Master Document template and be leary of changes to the template as subdocuments are created. If you do this, I suppose all of the marvelous features will work as advertised. I haven't tried it yet."
2,disappointly shallow,"Much as I like a light book on a long flight, I found Say Uncle rather shallow, with very limited character and plot development. This book only got finished thanks to being trapped on a 22 hour flight with nothing better to read.Having said that, the lack of depth did at least leave some intriguing gaps for the imagination to fill and it did make me laugh out loud a couple of times, hence the score above 1"
2,Micheal screamed and shrieked!,"Yikes! And that's how I often felt- that I was being screamed and shrieked at. The storyline is nice but the execution was not good. Shallow, yes but with one dimension for many of the characters and that was *annoying*.A good fantasy, if you like to think about making ooodles of money, having a nice housekeeper, and being a young boy sleeping with cute rich girls."
4,excellent read,"I absolutely loved this book. Being a book cynic, it's rare for a modern work of fiction to move me - but this one made me laugh and cry and come away feeling good that there are still some writers out there that can touch me. Uncle Michael was a hoot!"
2,"Well-intentioned and often funny, but spotty","A well-balanced child is raised by an eccentric, gay uncle in the wake of controversy and tragedy: Who but the most intolerant could argue with that storyline? But good intentions don't always make for good writing, unfortunately, and this book tends toward flat, unrealistically presented stereotypes and too-convenient plot devices. But the title ""uncle"" is indeed a character -- if not likable, a clearly drawn funny, outspoken CHARACTER. A cute read if you don't take it too seriously and expect more than is there."
3,A woman mercenary - story has potential,"I picked up this story as I thought it would be a great role reversal story with the mercenary being a woman and all. But, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The woman is a kick but woman with a take charge personality etc. But, as soon as she meets Eli she seems to seek ""her weaker side"" in most things. In this case I think she gives in and looses a bit of who she is. But, that is my issue with the overall plot.The book was well written. I do think that the ending seemed to be a bit rushed and things fell together quicker than normal in the last 2 chapter but, this is one of Fosters older novels and I think she has grown as a writer since then."
1,This book must have been phoned in...hideous.,I heard good things about this book...unfortunately they were wrong. This story is lacking in plot development and the characters are all one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs. Tried to slog through it but the writing was very juvenile. Don't bother with this one. The only other L.Foster book I can recommend is Say No To Joe and only half-heartedly at that. Save your money.
2,There were more than enough books like this even before...,"Every school seems to need this kind of book - so the ""Makers of Leaders"" story gets a bit tiresome even if there are good reasons to study USMA. But better look elsewhere."
5,"If you live on Oahu, or if you're just visiting, this is a must have guide!","The reviews already here aren't lying--I found the reviews to be accurate--the book is excellent. It covers the whole island from a the point of view of someone who has lived here long enough to know the best areas. Photographically, the images, hints and location information is very helpful. The book is so good I am considering buying it for folks looking to visit Oahu (just moved there). Highly Recommended!"
5,Coleman Heater,"This heater works great! I used it camping with night time temps in the low 40's. Granted I was in thermals and a warm sleeping bag, but the heater worked nicely in my 10 by 14 tent. We also used it at high school football games on the bleachers, that made a big difference in comfort. Will definately use it camping in cold weather though, and I think there is enough air flow in a tent just by its nature to allow the heater to be kept on all night. Maybe keep a window or 2 open a bit.Took me a while to realize, but if you open the gas and let it run for say 15-30 seconds, the insta start works well. Doesn't seem to light when you first open the valve. The metal grill will burn you, so holding it on your lap, or with kids around, extra care is needed.It's plenty warm, will probably last years and years, and is very convenient to keep warm, whatever you're doing outside."
5,Fantastic,"I am so happy I got this!!! I was camping out on 30* nights, it was cold! I turned this on an hour before I got into the tent and you could feel at least a 10* difference, it was still a little chilly, but made sleeping much more comfortable. I highly recommend this product!!! Well worth the money and then some!"
3,Instastart?,"You can probably save yourself some money and buy the heater without the instastart tecnology, because it has yet to work. I have always had to resort to using a match to start the heater. Once the heater is started it does a good job of keeping my 10 x 10 tent nice and warm. But I do have a canvas tent that probably stays warmer than a tent with a rainfly that is vented at top."
2,"Good for camping, not for tailgating","I purchased this to use during tailgating.Tried it out for 1/2 hour or so and was not satisfied.Very little heat produced. Could only feel a difference if within a few inches of the heater. Would probably work just fine in an enclosed area, but not out in the open. Will need to look for something else, or just deal with the cold :)Item was returned."
3,Its okay,"I had pd. way to much for this in our college bookstore, I did read through it, but it didnt really help me with any classes or in clinicals. I give it a three because some of the stuff is interesting, but I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. I would recommend pharmocology made easy."
4,Nice Opening Tricks,My rating is 1430 and I am learning quite a bit from this book. Someone with a much higher rating could still get something out of this book. But I do think this book is targeted toward intermediate players.The errors are annoying but you can generally figure out what should have been printed.There are lots of e4 opening traps. Be aware there are very few d4 opening traps.
1,Does not meet its stated goals.,"In the introduction, Pandolfini explains that this is not a book full of opening lines ""that charts numerous moves, with little or no commentary."" Unfortunately, this book does not provide a useful analysis of the openings to the amateur player. Instead, an extremely bad position is shown where the opponent has made one or more blunders followed by Pandolfini's explanation of how to exploit the blunder. This book also suffered from numerous printing errors. There is an error in the very first diagram! This book is a fun exercise in how to destroy a weaker opponent, but helps little to improve your game."
4,This is a very instructive book for novice players.,"There are a lot of tactical themes which can be learned from this book which a beginner or a novice player can benefit. Also, this book gives some traps which a novice player may encounter when playing 1.e4 e5 openings. Also includes quotations to inspire the beginning player."
5,happy,"I was at the Seattle show featured in the DVD and it was a great experience. Tweedy managed to communicate on a very intimate level with the ""abyss""... I'm sure everyone took what they needed/wanted away; I left feeling just really happy and it carried me through the dreary Seattle month of February (Thanks, Jeff). The DVD doesn't have the immediacy or warmth of the show (I'd never expect it to), but in a way it's more intimate - I even find myself getting a little squirmy watching Tweedy sing during close-up shots. The important thing is it makes me smile the same way the show did and is well worth it just for that. The downloads were a very happy surprise."
4,Not bad,"My 5-year old son bought himself this set just as the show premiered. He is a HUGE Power Rangers & Transformers fan - mostly liking the Zord toys and Transformers for the ability to change them and interconnect them. This set is pretty good but my son was disappointed to discover that the Zords can be used separately or in Titan Megazord mode but NOT in the Dragon Megazord mode so now he is asking for the Titan Megazord that can be transformed.All in all, it's a nice little set especially when traveling but for the die-hard fans, you might want to spring for other toys in the series."
5,Monster Blood III,"The book Goosebumps: Monster Blood 3 is a 126 page book and every page of the book is thrilling. It is a great book for everybody. It's one of my favorite books.This book is about two boys and a girl named Andy. The older boy's name is Evan and the younger boy's name is Kermit. Evan and Andy are best friends, and Kermit is Evan's little cousin. Evan is Kermit's baby sitter after school and on weekends. He can't stand baby sitting his genius cousin. Just when Andy and Evan were ready to give Kermit pay back for his rotten tricks some thing went terribly wrong. That's all I'll tell you. You'll have to read the book to see what happens next.If you read this book I guarantee that you'll like it. I give this book 5 stars. I like this book because it has no confusing part so I can under stand every word.You will like this book from the first word to the last. You will not want to put this book down."
3,From Back Cover,"Elizabeth Lowell... Reckless Love -- The moment Janna Wayland encountered half-dead Ty Mackenzie she vowed to make him well - and hers. But Ty wanted a refined wife, while all she could offer wa her untamed heart...Heather Graham... Dark Stranger -- Her father murdered, he home besieged, Kristin McCahy needed a miracle to survive... Cole Slater became her protector, lover... the husband. But this dark stranger battled demons that threatened their fledgling marriage...Miranda Jarrett... Columbine -- Though her bloodlines ran blue, betrayal had transformed Dianna Grey from English lady to indentured servant. Rugged Kit Sparhawk found a kindred spirit in the lonely beauty - and was determined to replace her cold distrust with raging passion!"
3,"Compact, portable","Small, portable, perfect for travelling such as LAN party and such. The body construction is a little weak, wouldn't recommend putting anything heavy on the case. Ventiliation is very good, although the stock fan is horrible, when are they ever good. Once fans are replaced, the internal air circulation is really good. It's a Micro ATX case so don't expect a lot of room for expansion and such but it's plenty room still. The build I have is a gaming rig with dual video card setup and it works perfect. If you are truly tight on space, wants an unique case that's portable, then look no further. Otherwise, you can easily get a bigger case for a cheaper price."
2,An unreview,"This dvd was purchased as a gift for a young girl. The box was crushed when I received it, but I had no choice but to give it her because that was what she had said she wanted for her birthday. I did not view the dvd myself, but the recipient said she enjoyed it."
3,NOT TO GOOD,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE ON THE DISNEY CHANNEL, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ANOTHER AWSOME MOVIE BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED IT WASNT THAT GOOD. I WOULD'NT BUY THIS ON DVD THATS FOR SURE."
4,Very Impressive,This watarfall faucet is quite impressive. The flow is great and the style is a real conversation piece. Girlfriends think it's the coolest faucet they've ever seen.
2,Pump review,"The vacuum pump on this product works better than any extraction pump I've ever tried. Far and away the best product of this type for the money and if it hadn't leaked at the bottom seam, I would have given this 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, I had the product for a couple of months before I actually used it, so I didn't bother to send it back. The leak isn't large, and I'm able to change the oil on my boat with minimum mess if I empty the tank quickly enough. However, it shouldn't have leaked at all."
3,Didn't age well for me,"Try as I might, I could not get into this book as much as I wanted to. I originally read this book (all of the series) back in 1987-8 and I remember liking the books quite a bit. Now the writing seemed stilted and the plot heavy handed."
2,What more is there to say?,"This series is a classic of its kind. It tells a good sci-fi story, even if it does sometimes get dragged down with dull and lengthy pontifications. It nevertheless told an interesting ""what if"" tale. It was basically a story told in four books, which ended in what seemed to be a conclusive ending, the resurrection capability repaired and restored, and everyone living happily ever after.Then along came ""Gods of the Riverworld"". Whatever possessed Farmer to write it is a mystery to me. It is anti-climactic, and has the feeling of being tacked on to the main body of work. It isn't that it is a bad read, it is just that it adds so little, and literally put me to sleep."
4,Mounting Bracket 010-10457-00 Construction,The item was received in good condition. It does work as reviewed by others here. It adheres very well to the windshield. I agree with the reviewer who wished it had sideways rotation. That could be a benefit when using only reflected light with the GPSMAP 60CSx.I would like to see the technical specs include the construction material for these products as RAM MOUNT does for theirs. That would help in the decision making process.
4,Garmin Mounting Backet,"I enjoy this item, but it should have a slider slot that you can make it longer or shorter. Some car windows are sloped different then others. It just fits, but the antenna is right against the windshield, its not a bad thing it holds it in place but its hard to read the screen sometimes."
5,Good price and great performance,This was the best price I found for this item. I use it regularly and enjoy this product.
3,"Holds onto the GPS just fine, just not the dash plate",While this little bracket does a great job of hanging onto the GPS unit it's a different story when it comes to the suction cup sticking to the plate it comes with. I've got a Magellan that I use side by side with my Garmin and the Magellan will stay in place for months at a time while the Garmin falls off the dash weekly. It's frustrating to say the least but I've learned to deal with it and remove the Garmin from the dash (which leads to less use of the Garmin). It's too bad they couldn't get the suction cup to work as well as others have.
1,Not a durable product,"Within 10 minutes of receiving the frisbee my dog destroyed it - I have a Lab. I threw it to him a couple of times and he chewed right through it. I panicked because I couldn't find a big chunk of it in my yard and I was terrified that he swallowed it. This should not be advertised as a durable and tough toy, or at least it should be revised for bigger dogs. I called the company and they were great, told me to send it back for a full refund. For non-chewers and not so active dogs it's probably good, it just didn't work for me."
1,faulty product,I bought the season as a gift and the recipient was unable to watch the seson. The discs kept freezing up. I had to return the item and get a refund.
2,Not A Full House,"I don't think the problem with this season is the detective plot or revisits of motherhood for the chief...but I think certain continuous issues with 13 are exhausting the plot-she's dating men, she sleeping with women, she dying, she living, etc...I don't wanna hear about 13 anymore. There are no episodes that really moved me this season nor were there any interesting antics other than House's issues with drugs? More serious than funny or entertaining. I'm only interested in buying just to have a complete series; basing my loyalty solely on the weight of previous seasons."
5,Very entertaining!,"Always enjoy this show. ""There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love."" 1 John 4:18"
3,One-trick Pony,"It is a testimony to my self-induced boredom that I purchased still another season of this repetitive series. I could just watch Season 1 over and over again and save the money. There is so much predictability, particularly in the repetitive gruesome and erroneous torture of wrongly-diagnosed patients until AHA! the dream team comes up with the real answer. Were I one of those patients, I would have requested euthanasia far before they got to the AHA! The fact that the entertainment value comes from a rude, crude, mean-spirited man ... well, that just is a sad commentary."
3,Great show but...,So I ordered this brand new and it came with a broken case. Well anyone who's ever dealt with these cases know that the disk doesn't want to stay in without the disk holder attached to the case.I was very disappointed in this but perhaps it broke in transit.
5,Love it,I absolutly love HOUSE and have watched every episode since season one. I like the mix up of things with Cameron and Chase in the background. It gives oppertunity to bring them to the forfront again. I am buying two copies. One for me and my husband who loves House just as much.
5,House forever,House is my favorite show on television! I usually watch my box sets of House but I left them at a friend's place and am too addicted not to watch it every night! Was a great episode and worth my money.
4,Crazy Dr. House,"Since I love House I find it hard to review him. I was very happy that House took on the subject of mental illness. I had truly wondered how long they could realisticaly go until he exhibited symptoms. Though the character's usual way of dealing with things is sarcasm, denial, and more denial they nailed a breakdown in this season. The acting was wonderful as always, but the issues in this one were what I applaud them for."
5,Global Jarmusch,"I caught Night on Earth on cable TV. I want this DVD! I'll be watching it over and over with my friends. It's funny and entertaining, reflexive and whimsical in a mixture that became Jim Jarmusch's signature. These are five vignettes that take place in taxi cabs, each in a different place on Earth: LA, NY, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. Each tells a story that extracts the essence of each location using actors and language of the place. For instance, the Rome episode has Roberto Benigni (of the Wonderful World fame) driving a cab in the night-time Rome. He picks up a Catholic priest, and makes him listen to the confession about his sexual adventures. The story is so funny and the delivery so masterful that you end up rolling on the floor with laugs. A definite keeper!"
1,So You Wanna Lose Your Money!,"I wish they allowed for 0 stars. John Patrick is not an idiot. He has mad a good living off of gambling. Not by playing, but by telling people what they want to hear, that blackjack is a beatable game that can beaten with little or no math skills and no scientific approach. If you do not count cards using a proven method such as Hi-Lo, K/O, AOII, High-OptII, UPC, etc (John Patricks hunch method from his Card Counting books is utter nonsense) you can not gain an edge over the house. Money management can not help you win. The cards have no memory of wins or loses, if you bet more after you win, less after your lose, or vice versa you have the same odds if you had just bet the same. If you would like a good book that can help you at least break even (you will never get rich from BJ) try Knock-Out Blackjack by Fuchs and Vancura."
1,No Magic,In midnight warrior Alberic chooses Gwen for his bride sending the older sister Emma to court and younger sister Nicole to the church. I found not much compassion in Gwen as her sister's are forced to leave their home. Alberic is very arrogant even though the author tries to make him sympethic and Gwen is more interested in coupling with Alberic at all times than anything else. They were not characters I could like.
3,What they DONT tell you about the DVD,AMAZON LEAVES OUT TELLING YOU THAT IT IS A BURNED COPY!!!I'd have really liked to have known that little detail! I'd have skipped the purchase then.also for the sequel it's not got any of the original actors returning for their rolls!.....it's a Korda pix yes but not that fantastic lifts a couple of scenes directly out of the original pimpernel. that first execution scene at the guillotine and the flag waving.Since there was no cast listing in here I was hoping to see Leslie Howard again!This purchase was a MAJOR LETDOWN!!and the cover is what you see there with minuscule type really very off center.I'm no graphic artist but heck Even I could do a better job with my Adobe Home Photo 3 from 2000 than what is done for a cover here
5,How lucky can we get?,"First,of course,the singing, or maybe I should say vocal acting:all the cast are totally committed to their roles and I only wish I could have been present at the performance.It is refreshing to hear such a vivid recording in this often too scholarly field. Graham and Hampson are intense and passionate without sacrificing any of the vocal line or considerable beauty of their singing.The recording manages to convey the drama of the performance and is the next best thing to actually being there.More please!!"
5,Magnificent drama,"This is a remarkable piece of drama which skillfully integrates biographical information from the life of the novelist Jean Rhys with excerpts from Jane Eyre. Written by Polly Teale and performed by Britain's Shared Experience Theatre Company, this is the finest piece of theatre I have witnessed in the past 20 years. The play is fascinating in its structure, striking in its intelligence, and completely moving in its portrayal of the inner life of a truly unique woman."
1,POOR QALITY NOT STATED LIVE,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY YOUR OLD RECORDS SOUND BETTER. NOT STATED LIVE. MEDLEYS NOT COMPLETE SONGS NOT WORTH THE 14.99 UNKNOWN LABEL NO ONE TO COMPLAIN TO YOU BUY YOU OWN IT
3,Brave little man.,"This was a neat little story, however it doesn't deserve all the praise. I mean I'm sure I'll forget it along with many other books I've read. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't ever poorly written and it was for the most part always entertaining. But compared to the books I read it definetly wasn't a stand out. That's why I don't understand all the rave reviews? Maybe I missed something others didn't. Anyway it's a cute story and worth reading, just don't expect it to blow your mind like all the reviewers have stated."
3,Saucony Hurricane 8 review,"My son preferred the Saucony Hurricane 8 running shoes over other shoes he had tried until he realized that the outer heel material was rather soft and caused his leg to twist.As far as ""If the Shoe Fits"" goes, this order was messed up. I order three pairs of shoes, they shipped one and said they shipped three. My only other order with them was filled correctly and promptly."
2,beautiful but delicate,this pattern is very pretty but chips very easily. on the first day of ownership a plate broke during normal handwashing. barely tapped it on the sink and it fell in half. replaced it immediately. during the next week 2 more chips appeared. after 2 months approx. 50% of the dishes have chipped or are broken. have owned for 1 year now and am replacing already. may be nice if you don't use them oftem but not for everyday use. am very dissapointed.
3,"a very mixed book, especially now that time has passed, as has interest","poor Richard Farina, he seems to have caused it all, and if nothing else, the author seems to have it in for him"
1,Reads like a Name-Dropping Gossip Columnist's Attempt at Biography,"I listened to the audiobook version of this book and had to force myself to finish the whole book. A lot of name-dropping and snide remarks about people based on what I don't know. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. It was obvious that the author had a thinly veiled dislike of the four main characters and made very subjective comments about them. There was no attempt to be objective - and I was irritated by the reader's attempt at imitating the accents of different characters - like Albert Baez, for example - and kept wondering where the author got his information. And if the imformation came from someone he had interviewed - how did that person know what people were thinking. VERY unprofessional writing in my opinion. Don't waste your money on this book. Look at how these people lived their lives instead."
3,Highbrow folk gossip,"An interesting, gossipy book . . . but (though not to idolize Dylan or anything), can he possibly have been the monosyllabic bastard that Hajdu tries to portray him?In other words, this is an entertaining read, especially if you enjoy dirt on famous people, but I would take its character judgments with several quarts of salt.Also, as a long-time dulcimer player, I resent Hajdu's dismissal of Richard Farina's musicianship because that's ""all"" he played. It's not as easy as all that!"
3,The ship needs blood!,"I just watched this recently, after reading about it in an issue of Horrorhound magazine. I enjoyed it for what it was. It was very low budget, but there were creepy scenes. The blood shower scene is pretty awesome! The main flaw, in my opinion anyway, comes from the choppy editing. I guess this was done on purpose (or so the director claims), but it just irritated me. Also, I could tell that some plot-related scenes had been cut out. This was probably due to pacing reasons I'm guessing. It kind of hurt the finished film as a whole. Over all, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to fans of low-budget horror from the late 70's/early 80's. Also of note, there is a fantastic dvd version available from the Amazon UK site. It's uncut and has a ton of special features too. Well worth picking up."
5,fantastic,what can i say if i did not have it i would pay$135.00 dollasfor it!!!!!its low budget but clissic horror at its best
5,mind blowing,just listened this album and really this is worth to be praised and more Lucky Ali deserves the praise.
2,Waiting for the Emotion,"I was disappointed in the lack of detail and emotion expressed in this book by the author. It seemed to be written on the surface, rather than in depth. The author glossed very quickly over all his experiences, kind of like the letters he wrote to his mom. Skimming and void of emotion. What about the love he felt for his comrades, how did he feel when they were wounded, how did he feel when some got to go home before he did? He touches on this type of thing, but again, no real emotion seems to be expressed. I felt very let down at the end of the book. He couldn't even let himself write about the sheer joy he must have experienced when that ""freedom bird"" cleared the range of enemy fire and he knew he was actually on his way home. ""...I then leaned back in my seat and relaxed."""
3,Overall good but disapointing,"I agree with the reader from oklahoma, the author does a good job of describing his experiences and im sure vets and readers new to the genre will appreciate his detail on certain things but for a reader like me who has read tons of other vietnam memoirs this one seemed very devoid of emotion. The experiences of being wounded and seeing friends die are probably very vivid still in the mind of the author but he doesnt do an exceptional job in describing his emotions in a way that seems compelling to a reader whose read other memoirs like Suicide Charlie or A Rumor of War. Overall a good read still and the author is to be comended for his heroic actions in that war."
5,Great book,I was searching for a book that was Non-gender for a Daddy to be. This fit the bill with thick card board pages and bright pictures. A great first book for baby and dad.
4,"Great for preschoolers, especially with companion book","Although my children prefer Porter-Gaylord's ""I Love My Mommy Because"" companion book, this one is a close second. Again, its heavy pages resist tearing by small hands, and Wolff's beautiful paintings of unusual animals demonstrate that even in the animal kingdom, babies have daddies who care for them. Recommended for children as young as age 2."
5,Old Reliable,"I use this as 1 of five scents (polo. polo blue, ck1, obsession and this). I've usedDrakkar in the past and often received good feedback. I's not one of the stronger scents just what I would consider an old reliable choice that you can't go wrong with."
2,Great if You're a Barbar or Cab Driver,"I must say, when I received this cologne I was baffled! All these reviews sold me. I cannot for the life of me figure out why it's rated so high.- It smells like aftershave, not anything fancy, just a brand you buy for 3 dollars off the shelf at Walmart.- This cologne is a cab drivers scent, just put on a hat and spray this on, GOOD TO GO.- This cologne is suited for old men (60+), that work on a boat and catch crab.- My brother likened it to: A polish man who'd been working out all day, and leaned over a bottle and squeezed his sweat out into a bottle, then mix in a few raddish's and onions, and you have Drakkar Noir.I dont think Ill ever take these reviews serious again after ordering this.. Either they are Guy Laroche's friends, or they live on another planet, this cologne is nothing special, unless you live in a desert and never smelled soap."
5,Love this stuff!,I love the smell of this stuff and buy it for my S.O. when he runs out. This is a great price compared to what it would cost me in the stores.
2,Buy with caution!,"I wanted to try something different, so, i searched for a perfume with highest customer rating and that's how i bought 6.7oz bottle. My biggest problem is this perfume doesn't linger for more than an hour! I just found out that Amazon don't accept returns for inflammable items!! I don't how the dept. store bottle performs, but,this one don't at all."
5,80s scent that just gets better with age,"This stuff smells amazing, and i enjoy spraying it on in the norning after a shower. My wife enjoys the scent as well."
5,All Around Fragrance,"I started wearing Drakkar Noir again after not wearing it for a long time. Now I remember why I started wearing Drakkar Noir in the first place. It is a great all around scent. When you look at your collection of fragrances, this is the one you can wear to work or when you go out. As you pick up the scent from yourself, you may not feel that it smells good but you do get compliments and smiles when you wear Drakkar Noir. Drakkar Noir is a sensual fragrance and works for any occasion. Although this is a spicy fragrance, it is not overpowering and will last throughout the day. You will not be disappointed with Drakkar Noir."
5,I sure do stink purty now,"I've always love Drakkar, and this bottle is huge. The price was what sealed it for me, because what I paid would have maybe gotten me half this amount of cologne in a store. Cannot beat that."
5,all right,"Fast and responsible! as they chose so as it came, all in order.What else I can say is the perfume that my dad used daily and loves, plus is the only one who does not give you allergies."
4,The Title Speaks for Itself,"As the title states, this is a collection of historic photos (all black and white) of pre-1950 opera stars. These are high quality prints in a soft-cover volume. The photos contain very brief biographical sketches of the subjects, including dates, voice classification and area of principle activity. This is an invaluable tool for the historic opera buff. While some of the photos are standard issue, most are unique or from the author's personal collection. Now, when you hear the names Caruso, Ruffo, Pinza, Ponselle, Melba, etc., you can see what these great singers looked like -- usually in full costume."
4,works like a charm,"I have an inboard ski boat and this product works as advertized. Made winterizing a snap and spring startup very nice, versus hauling the boat to the ramp and crossing your fingers that everything is going to work after sitting for 6 months."
2,Not the real thing!,"Pfaltzgraff, my foot! Stamped made in China and painted very likely with lead paint! This is not a true Pfaltzgraff, so if that's what you're looking for, forget it!!! Having lived in Pennsylvania Dutch Country for 18 years, I know a real Pfaltzgraff when I see it. Fair warning!"
2,No answer explanations!,"I am really distracted by this - I have the current (eighth) edition and it says on the back and on the description here that the end of chapter questions have full explanations for all answer choices, which I value. Yet the appendix at the back is just an answer key with no explanations at all, just letters. This is really distracting to me, I keep thinking they must be somewhere! But it's not that big of a book. They totally aren't there, they aren't anywhere - it makes me not trust anything this book says, if they're going to screw that up so blatantly."
1,Can't cut the mustard,"I used this spreader to put rye grass seed on a couple of food plots, using a riding mower to pull it. It lasted all of 1 1/2 plots before the gears separated and the wheel stopped spinning. When I tried to see if there was something I could adjust I was amazed at just how flimsy the rotating components were and how loosly they all fit together. The hopper, wheels and tubing which hold it together are fine; but the rest is extremely undersized. I do not recommend this unit for any application. Two thumbs down."
3,agri fab spreader,I recieved fast shipment. The unit needed a longer cable to work with my mower for an aditional $12.oo. The rotating wiper is not long enough to keep product from cloging. I am not all that happy with spreader.
4,Great Product,The item shipped on time and was in great condition. It goes wonderful with a 1080p hdtv and blueray disc.
5,Doc,I love the British shows and this is very good. But why do we have to wait 18 months for a new series?
5,Great Series,This was a very good series. I wish it was longer or had a part two or something.Surely there is more to add to the story? What becomes of Al for instance?
3,"A good book, but no substitution for a visit to this great Museum.","I suppose it's to be expected that the volume would touch on many of the works presented at the museum and that it's unreasonable to expect that it would in any way focus on one area of art over another (eg paintings). That said, to me the book does seem to give overwhelming weight to historic pieces of pottery and figurines, and less to the many magnificent paintings in the museum from the many eras covered there.What's unfortunate is the amount of white space and text in the book. Text and pictures share almost the same amount of space across the pages. Yes, descriptions and information is important, but it seems to me in most instances white areas with text could have been limited to a smaller amount of space without reducing the word count, allowing for more images or larger images."
1,What are they thinking?,"With Blu-ray, they could have and should have included BOTH the theatrical release and extended cuts in this product.It's obvious they are repeating the same game of trying to get people to buy the theatrical cuts, then buy the extended cuts when those come out.Greed and idiocy combined is never a happy picture.Loved the movies, but the way they are packaging the Blu-rays is a complete rip off. Hopefully it's not too late to get them to reverse course, but if it is, they can choke on the unsold inventory and have similar boycotts waiting for them and their blu-ray theatrical releases of the other two movies as well."
5,Great Trilogy,"I bought this Collection knowing these are the theatrical version, but also knowing I would never watch any extra bd or dvd, so 3 disc BD was more than enought for me.Excellent sound.Excellent image."
1,Why not EE???,"Save your money for the EE's when they come out. New Line is out of line for trying to do this to consumers. The blu-ray edition should be something better than what we already have on DVD. Why are they trying to double dip us when the economy is already bad, and blu-ray is still trying to take off? It just doesn't really make sense to me, but for them, it is surely dollar signs."
1,Give us the Extended Edition!,"The other reviews have said it all - this is a one-star product. The film as a whole is four stars - but FIVE as an extended edition. It's useless to have this trilogy on BluRay without the extended versions. I have NEVER watched the theatrical versions since purchasing the Extended DVDs, and I don't plan on doing so again. The same goes for most people I know. We have waited anxiously for these films to be viewed in all of their depth and glory on BluRay. We will wait longer if we have to, in order to enjoy them right."
3,"mmmm extra material, mmm what a mess !!!","yeah, it's the lord of the rings trilogy, but the extra material is a mess. it doesn't have a structure, order... mmmm"
1,New Line & Time Warner Bros= SHAME SHAME Toby Emmerich,This is greed to the MAX...do NOT buy this crap set..please WAIT until the Extended Editions are released..this set is [...] from Amazon..it will surely plummet to $30 when the extended editions are released..just enjoy the films on TBS HD..do not let Toby Emmerich (New Line COO) steal your money..he's only using it to purchase more vehicles..this is so shameful.
1,BZZT! Try again.,"Sorry New Line. Try again. I'll be waiting for the extended version, along with everybody else. I'll second the request of many to provide both versions in one set."
2,Incredibly Easy misses it's mark.....,"While I am a big fan of the ""Incredibly Easy"" nursing series, this one glosses over areas that need more in-depth explanations. This book will give you a very basic overview of most critical care topics, but it isn't specific or technical enough to get the job done. Good for beginners, but a real ICU nurse needs more than this book provides."
2,Fob not what it should be!,No problem programming the Fob. Problem is it interferes with the Radio and it does not ding for acknowledgment (therefore one needs to be right by the car to make sure it has locked) I have left my lights on numerous times for I have not been alerted when leaving the car (issue when it's not dark outside but overcast). The car started locking on its on and to the point of locking me out and not letting the key unlock it (actually the locks went bezerk.) Reprogramed it again and that has helped but it is still locking on it's own but not as frequent. Always Leary!
2,A made-at-home DVD-R,"I was amazed when I saw how unprofessionally this product was packaged, and even more surprised to find a DVD-R inside the case! The DVD wouldn't play on my player at first, but after ejecting it a few times I was able to get it to play. The production is amateur, and the content is average at best. This is a production of an A.R.E. associate, the organization that tries to prove the validity of Edgar Cayce's psychic readings. I was disappointed in every aspect of this product."
3,Not what I expected,"This is a chit-chat book. There is little, if any data and not much delving into the details of theories about why twins are similar or different. A lot of anecdotes. It's OK for bedtime reading."
4,Great Bath Fan/light,I have had this in my bathroom for a few months and I am very pleased with it. The fan is super quiet and the light is effecient yet subdued. Our bathroom is 150 square feet and this unit handles it quite well. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is difficult to install.
2,Recording quality not up to the content,"Although I love the selections, and probably would enjoy the singing, I did not enjoy this recording. It is a live recording and the echo-ey vocals are overpowered by the piano. It was hard for me to catch the words,and that is rather what this CD is all about."
2,A Life More Ordinary,"It's possible that I haven't given ""Out of Season"" enough of a chance, but after 2 listens through I'm a bit disappointed. Gibbon's voice is interesting and emotive, as always, but the lyrics seem to lack edge, and music isn't especially interesting- piano and orchestral mainly. I understand that artists want to experiment and not be pidgeonholed and whatnot, maybe Beth Gibbons didn't want to spend the rest of her life as a Trip-Hop Goddess, but this album seems like a sort of ordinary use of her extrordinary talents. Her voice is good, but not enough to carry the album for me. ""Tom the Model"" is the only track that stands out in my mind."
3,A Questionable Reference,"For frequent readers of ""Southern Accents"" magazine, this will just be a rehash of previously published photos. Unfortunately, it is not a particularly handy reference since inaccuracies in printing do not give the true color, or a different color from the original printing in the magazine in any case. Clearly it is an ""armchair"" editing job where the author never visited any of the rooms shown. There is no serious text on the use of color in interior design. Although there is the typical focus on a detail of a floral arrangement or place setting that is an infamous trademark of the magazine, the views of interior furnishings are generally interesting for those who enjoy traditional interior design. As designer credits are particularly lacking, it is not a good reference for interior design. However, readers of the magazine will recognize the work of Barry Dixon, Holden & Dupuy, Bobby McAlpine, John Tackett and Josie McCarthy among many others."
5,We love Little People!,"This Noah's Ark is too cute! My daughter got this last year for Christmas when she was 6 months old. We opened it up for her when she was about 8 months old, and she has played with it ever since. She loves the animals, and can name them now. I love that the ark stores all of the animals - you don't have to worry about losing any of them.I'm glad we have this version of the toy. I've seen the new ""touch and feel"" version in the stores - and I can see a problem with being able to clean them. I guess you might be able to put them in the dishwasher, but I'm sure the textures would lose the original feel. I prefer the animals without the texture - nice and easy clean-up. I'm sure children will love the ""touch and feel"" variety, but I'm not sure parents will prefer them.I really think this version is a better way to go. And you definitely can't go wrong with Little People toys! There's so much to learn and do!"
2,"Comprehensive, but way to basic","Although this book does cover numerous topics, the information provided is common sense ""fluff"" and not detailed at all. If you have never consulted before, this might be a good source of information; however, if you are currently a consultant considering the leap to independence, this book will be of little value to you. I don't feel it was worth the [$]."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I checked this book out from the library with copyright material from 1998. After searching for a newer version I find the following message: ""Publisher: Adams Media (October 30, 2010)"". This is straight false advertisement. This version I downloaded is the original from 1998. I am absolutely dissappointed with this purchase. How in the world am I going to get my $10 dollars back? Cheap purchase, expensive experience. ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH IT. IM PACKING MY BAGS AND GOING TO BARNES AND NOBLE. UNFAIR. UNFAIR. FOUL!!!"
5,Best Bottle Rack,"this rack is great. It holds so many bottles, nipples, little bowls, caps, spoons, etc. I don't actually use the Dr. Brown's bottles, but this rack is great for any bottles. Would recommend simply for the amount it holds."
1,Doesn't let the inside of bottles dry,"If you put bottles on this rack, they will eventually get dry... the key word here is ""eventually"". If you wash at night and need things to be dry in the morning, try something else. There just isn't enough air flow to get nipples, bottles, or breast pump accessories dry on the inside. We had no idea how bad it was until we tried another rack - the Boon Grass drying mat. It cut our evening washing time in half because we no longer needed to hand-dry everything we needed for the next morning. I think pretty much any rack would be a better choice than this one - look for more air flow under the items, or racks that hold items at an angle to let air in."
3,Outdated,"With technology, we are constantly revamping our ideals and our techniques. This book has the reader left in the dark ages. Sadly, there are not many books on this specialized topic, so schools are still forced to use it. In my experience, this book is excellent when discussing internal controls and does a nice job of giving the reader a brief overview of how an accounting system works. Great for newbies into the field, but very dull for someone like me who has been worked with several different systems over the past ten years. That brings me to another point, the book is very dry. Don't look for humor or interesting facts here. Just plain information.If you are a teacher considering this book, I encourage you to either supplement or update the information provided in the text or to find another book."
2,Not as good as the others,"I bought this book because I absolutely loved the first four books. I did not, however, find this one anywhere near as funny. Although there were a few laughs, overall the book was just OK. I could not put the first few books down, and was really looking forward to reading this, but found myself switching to another book after the first few chapters. I did eventually read the whole book, but just did not really enjoy it. The Wedding Planner part is funnier than the Divorce Guide. Maybe she just has too many books and not enough ideas to go around and keep it fresh. I would be reluctant to purchase future books without checking them out first."
1,Good writer gone stale,"I found her first book fresh, new and laugh-out-loud funny perspective on the human condition. Her ""sequel"" books rehash the success of the original book with a few new tales contributed by her wannabes thrown in; dull, flat, uninteresting.I'll keep the original - I'll pass on the rest"
3,in depth book,I find this book interesting but sort of get lost in reading it. It goes into great depth of the subject
3,This is the author,"This is Travis Gill, author of this book. I hope that you have enjoyed reading this book. To aid those who wish to learn more about the characters, the story's roots, and other things, I have a webpage for you. This is also good for people who really have no idea about medieval times, and want to get a grasp on what the book is trying to show.It is located at http://www.astanax.com and I hope you find it worthwhile. And sorry for those who think this book is a 5 star, I'm being modest and don't want to boast, so I'm giving myself a 3, in between 1 and 5."
4,Nice shoe- runs small,"Sells for over $200 elsewhere. Tends to runs narrow and about a 1/2 size small, Other than that, very comfortable. I definitely recommend trying them on somewhere before ordering."
3,Decent Watch,I liked that there were different choices of color bands that the watch came in and that the watch lights up. The purpose for the purchase was for my daughter to wear a watch so she wouldn't be late for her classes. What I didn't like was that it was labeled for children 6yrs and up but the watch band is too big for a regular size 6 yr old. The band is the same length as my adult watch bands. So my 12 yr old daughter has to wear the watch on its smallest band setting.
5,Love It,"Bought for my great niece for her 8th birthday, she loves it. Last year I bought the same watch in the pink her sister's 8th birthday. They both love them and switch on wearing them."
2,"Watch is okay, the band is not","Title says it. The watch itself is fine, the band looks nice at first, but gets broken in couple of months. The weak area is where it connects to the watch, and it is really weak. This is watch for kids, probably first watch for most, and this was not great experience."
5,Gives a deeper experience of life,"Often we don't consider how hard life can be for some people, and how much ordinary people can do to help."
2,Dosg hates bed and refuses to use it,Nice concept. The dogs just hate the bed and won't go anywhere near it. I think its the smell Have tried putting blankets and stuff over top but to no avail.
3,A little difficult,There is some good information in this book but it seems a little pedantic for the lay reader. I purchased it to accompany a study I am leading on Proverbs hoping for more clarification on specific passages but I am disappointed in the construction of the book.
1,No Substance!,"The author(s) of this book are obviously not Pontiac enthusiasts, it would not have taken very much time to have a knowledgable person proof read this short book. Most of the cars are not correct, missing trim, dirty or damaged. The opinions presented are shallow and without merit. There are a few good pictures of royal bobcat decals and a couple of reproduced Pontiac ads making the $12.00 purchase worthwhile to me, but this book is not a source of factual information, in fact I found it very annoying to read."
1,Wasted time and money,"If you can open your mouth and words come out. Then you already do as this book say's. Very little info, if any at all. One star because he took the time to write something."
4,Pretty Awesome,"The title is sort of a lie, it's more than just starting conversations, it has plenty of great ideas for conversation in general, if you're a bit shy or just not comfortable talking to people you don't know, this book is awesome."
3,Not enough detail,Maybe it's just me but the book was all common sense stuff. There were not any real gems of information.
4,"Funny, as all Lileks books are","Not as good as ""The Gallery of Regrettable Food"", but still a great, amusing coffee table book that friends will enjoy thumbing through."
4,Funny but painful,"I love the Lileks books, but this one actually left me feeling a little sad for children who were raised this way. (I'm still giving it 4 stars because it's well done and as well-written as ever.)"
3,A literate stripper pens her story--better than average.,"This is the story about Sarah, or Tabitha, a stripper from BC. Many different aspects of her life conflict: her relationship with her mother and her father, her slug boyfriend Lloyd, and her own past history with disease that has disfigured her. She is highly intelligent and literate, in part owed to her father, an English professor. This makes her stand out among strippers.I found this book to be overwritten, and pretentious in some places. We get the feeling that Tabitha thinks she's better than the other strippers because she can quote Dante, yet she's exactly like the rest of them. I read the book all in one sitting, at the end just to get through it. There's no doubt that Atkinson can write. I'd like to see her try other, non-biographical topics."
4,"GREAT SWITCH, VERY LOUD","This switch is great. Solid build. BUT, it is very loud and cannot be used in a room that will have employees working. If you place it in a supply/server room its great. I went with 3 trendnet TPE-S44 that will give me 12 poe ports with no fans. There are devices you can mount inside to regulate fan speed but i didnt want to mess with that."
4,How different we really are!,Having traveled back and forth from the States to Mexico on numerous occasions I have found Condon's book very helpful in aiding in my understanding of the Mexican culture and mindset. Whether it be Christian short term missionaries or business men his analysis of the culture is very insightful. The past is what propels Mexicans while the future pulls us Americans forward. Mexicans have a much larger inclusive concept for the family than we Americans do. Mexicans also have two views of truth: Objective and interpersonal. Their speech is also more emotive than ours. Their concepts of time are also very different. These are just a few of the new things that can be learned from reading this book.
2,If you don't know anything at all about Mexicans....,"..then I suppose this might be okay. However, it didn't do much for me. You'd be better off just watching some good ol' telenovelas!"
3,Thrilling!,"The book is about a sponge called a Grool . What the Grool does is cause the owner bad luck , it is warm and the thing breaths . The Grool is causing bad luck to Kat and Daniel . They struggle to kill the Grool , but they finally figure out how to kill him . To find out the rest , read the book!"
2,"Cute, But Not One of Stine's Better Books","There isn't really a whole lot to say about this book. A couple of kids discover a vicious supernatural sponge undeneath their sink and have a run of bad luck until they love the Grool to death. Cute, goofy, and a good read for a kid, but I have seen Stine do much better than this before."
5,Just like the show!,When I started to read this book to my son he said Hey I saw thi on tv before. He really enjoyed this book! A must read from your powerpuff girls fan!
1,Outdated and Unclear,"This book is possibly the worst textbook I have ever read. The notation is unwieldy, the explanations are unclear and there is very little to help your intuition. This, by the way, is not because of the mathematical or technical content which goes no deeper than introductory stochastic calculus and control. Even if it were a good text, however, it would urgently need revising. The material is rooted firmly in the 70's and 80's with almost no emphasis whatsover on the martinagle represntation of asset prices."
4,"Business Law Today, Standard Edition",Arrived prior to the confirmation date. Was a little worried because the book was ordered a week before the class and was shipped standard delivery. Book was received the day before the class started. Book in excellent condition.
4,book in excellent condition,"The reason I wasn't completly satified is even though it was new, there wasn't a code included that is needed for the online course that my school is going to use. This is supposed to come with the book. Also I wasn't aware that there are two different editions for the 7th edition. There is a comprehensive edition as well as standard. I have been able to adapt the book any way and my teacher is nice enough to help me work around the code problem or I would of been s.o.l."
1,I was very dissatisfied with this item,I bought a book from this seller that was labeled under the standard edition when it was actually only the essentials edition. So I guess my review isn't even about the book pictured because that is not the book that I got. I tried contacting the seller for a return and did not even get a response back. So now I already spent $60 and had to re-buy the book for another $40 from some place else. The seller miss advertised the book and I will never be purchasing anything from this seller again and will be advising everyone I know not to also.
3,Business Law & Contracts,This book delves very deep into the Business & Contracts Aspect of Law. It isn't a basic text book by any means. Don't expect this to be easy reading unless you have had other law classes beforehand. But it is well written & compiled. A well done book!
5,Wonderful,Amazing. Beautifly written. Consise and clear narrative style with amazing imagery. You will love this book. I did.
4,"Excellent, but.....","Overall an excellent book, well told narative. My only gripe is that there aren't enough maps to illustrate the troop movements of both armies and the British ships."
2,A Disappointment,"I found this book to be very well researched. However, if you want to follow the battles and the movement of the troops you will have a very hard time if you are dependent on the maps. They are the original ones, drawn at the time, and extremely hard to read. I finally gave up and didn't bother; it was just too frustrating. Another problem that I had with the book is that the action really doesn't center on any one individual, but rather on a pastiche of different people. There are approximately 40 generals, both American and English that are introduced in the beginning of the book. The book begins in October 1775 and ends with a whimper and not a bang early in 1777. It is slow going in the beginning, for the first 120 pages and when it finally picks up you are left hanging with victory at Trenton and a quick summary of a couple of pages. The pace,structure and maps of this book are most unsatisfying."
2,1776 in review,I bought the book thinking it would read like a novel. I was completely wrong...it was more military oriented than I cared for.
5,McCullough again: 5 stars,"Much already has been written of McCullough and his storytelling, his ability to bring fresh understanding to well-worn tales. Yet, in this day of revisionism, of attacking any achievements and achievers in Eighteenth Century America, this is a welcome antidote. Strong recommendation."
2,History as a Nitpicking Grind,"If you like your history told in broad strokes then don't read this. However, if you are interested in George Washington's household accounts or the weather then climb aboard.You will learn that Washington was particularly fond of ""fresh fish"" and his kitchen in Virginia contained ""beef, lamb, roasting pig"", wild duck, geese, turtle... plums, peaches, barrels of cider, brandy and rum by the gallon, and limes by the hundred, these to fend off scurvy.""And I thought it was the British who were the ""limeys""!This is a typical extract from this book which presents a bottom-up view of history with so much trivia and detail that it is impossible to see the forest for the trees.It also takes an approach to Washington that is more hagiographical than biographical.American patriots might love it. This foreigner who, incidentally was cheering on the American side in this conflict, was very disappointed."
3,Could be better,"David McCullough is famous for his gripping and readable histories, and undoubtedly, he has a unique talent of making history more accessible for the general reader. I have read McCullough's biography of Ted Roosevelt, and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, ""1776"" failed to have the same effect on me.In ""1776"", McCullough covers the major battles the American forces fought against the British. Despite the title, McCullough only covers a few important battles: the fall of New York City, the siege of Boston, and the battles of Princeton and Trenton. He leaves out or barely mentions important events such as, the Declaration of Independence. The description of the battles is not very clear, and it was very hard for me to picture the battles.""1776"" is widely praised chiefly because it is a very readable and accessible account of the year 1776; however, it is far from being a deep and thorough account."
5,Learned a great deal!,"There is so much that I didn,t know about that time in history, I was shocked."
1,A defective history by a biased historian,"David McCullough calls his history ""1776,"" but it shockingly biased, omitting major players in this critical history of America's founding. It's all about George Washington and ""his"" revolution and no one else, with the possible exception of John Adams. Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, among other notables, do not even appear in this history! In this ""illustrated"" edition, it gets even worse. Although the book is beautifully illustrated with lots of pictures and copies of important letters, it leaves out letters and documents by Franklin, Jefferson and other vital figures. Is David McCullough trying to rewrite history? Is he reflecting his bias in favor of John Adams and against Ben Franklin? Check the index and see what I mean. It's incredible. It suggests a character flaw in an otherwise brilliant writer and speaker."
5,A Great Read,"1776 is another winner by David McCullough. If you have any knowledge of history, you know how it will end, but it's the story that is so riveting. The United States was still a brand new country in 1776. The threat that the Declaration of Independence could be negated by British and German military might was very real. McCullough tracks this tension with great historic research and draws us deep into the struggle. Kudos for another great book."
4,Another good one,I'm a fan of David McCollough and the subjects he chooses for his books. I wish I would have paid more attention in history class
5,Wow,"25 years ago I didn't pay attention at all in high school history class but I sure am rivited by this stuff now. I laughed. I cried. What drama! The book isn't about the entire Revolutionary War, just the events of 1776. I feel a much closer connection to the people of that time. An American all my life and yet I had no clue. I am very glad I purchased and read 1776. Gain a new perspective."
1,How to fill 300 pages describing 3 skirmishes,What a bore!I wish this was covering more history. My ideas about washington and the first American army are pretty low now. I seemed like the Brits wanted us to win our freedom.
1,did I miss something ?,"I bought this book last week, after reading all the raving reviews.Forced myself to read to page 50 before I put it down.There's no story, it's as if I'm back in 9th grade and I'm reading my history homework.Forgive me Mr. McCullough,but did I miss something?"
5,"Review of 1776, by David McCullough","This is a superb historical masterpiece, made interesting as only this great historian can do.Captain Wilbur H. Vantine"
3,"Good, interesting, but overrated","I tried to like this book, and mostly succeeded. It's well written and informative---up to a point. Perhaps all the pre-publication hype unrealistically increased my expectations. But I expected more. What I got was a collection of diary entries strung together to make a more or less coherent time-line of the year 1776, with the obligatory first chapter of background on the main characters figuring in the story. A decent map of Boston, New York, and Trenton, NJ, would have been a great help in following the narrative; instead, we got copies of contemporary British maps in which many of the roads and other features the author discussed were not shown. I read the whole book and was glad to be finished. The author's books on John Adams and Harry Truman were much better in their depth of treatment of the subject. This book lacks depth and analysis."
3,Lacked the Detail of Fischer's Washington's Crossing,"Having first read David Hackett Fischer's 'Washington's Crossing', I felt like I was reading a Cliff Notes version of that book when reading 1776. Clearly Fischer's book is the superior product. First, it contains many more maps and better detail of troop movements and significantly more detail of the battles themselves and critical decisions that were made. Second, it contains more interesting detail on Washington's life before assuming command and more detail about his critical decisions. Frankly there was little new in 1776 and much missing compared to 'Washington's Crossing'. I was so struck by the contrast that I couldn't help wonder if McCullough was essentially 'coasting' when he wrote this short book.McCullough's book is worth reading, but if you are going to choose to read one book on this time period, Fischer's book is clearly the better choice."
3,A Bit Of A Rehash,"On the heels of John Adams and Truman I had high hopes for 1776 To be honest, I didn't find much new or different in this book. I felt this book largely skimmed the surface of events and analysis that I had already known and was area that had been trodden before.Admittedly the book was short and well edited and was a good rendition of the time period and the events. It is probably better suited for a more general overview of the military actions around the Founding."
3,Synopsis,"The US fights the British in PA and New York from 1776 to the early 1780's, fighting which tapers off in the end with a few minor skirmishes and uprisings. The founding fathers (Hamilton, Adams, Madison, Jefferson) attend a Constitutional Convention and try to centralize the government. Slavery is lightely debated but no serious action is taken. George Washington regains some glory after early travesties in NJ and NY."
4,good story teller,If your a fan of history you will enjoy reading this book. The author has as much credit as anyone when it comes to accurately portraying our founding fathers. This book is a must for people slightly intersted in learning about history but aren't sure where to start. If your a history expert you might already know most of this information. But if your just getting started this is perfect. The book starts out in Boston after the battle of Bunker Hill and follows through to the battles/mistakes in NY then to Washington's crossing. Easy to follow and hard to put down.
4,A turning point in history,"Most of what many of us know about the American Revolution comes from high school or college text books. In 1776, David McCullough fleshes out the history by including descriptions of the physical and personal characteristics of those most heavily involved with the winning of this nation's freedom. George Washington, in particular, is no two-dimensional hero, but is shown with both his virtues and flaws. The condition of the Continental Army is described and documented in detail, including the absence of shoes and proper hygiene. Things could not have seemed more dire for Washington's forces after they retreated from New York in 1776. The turnaround came at Trenton, described by McCullough as a ""plain little place of no particular consequence"", which suddenly became the city of Washington's most significant victory. This book will be interesting to most, but especially history buffs who will enjoy the detail of military tactics and mistakes."
4,Fast and Furious,"Good book, and a fairly quick read for a book that thick. Full of quality research and primary sources, it covers the salient points and the critical episodes of what became the begining of the American Revolution. Peppered with sufficient details of what it was like as a grunt in the Continental Army, it also showed the greater context of the war that faced the Congress and senior militaty commanders. The book read fast and then it was over. It left me craving another book titled 1777?...how about it Mr. McCullough?"
5,Our Independence Was Not Free,"David McCullough never disappoints. 1776 is not a long book, compared to many of his previous books, but it is another one of his masterpieces. Rather than recounting the entire Revolutionary War, McCullough decided to capture one momentous year, 1776, and he did so with such detail that the reader grasps the tribulations and small victories of those that fought for what they believed in, from General Washington to the young, teenaged soldier. McCullough is correct when he stated at the end of his book that Americans often take their freedom for granted and we seldom appreciate the difficulties and sacrifices that our military has endured to allow us to enjoy our freedom. This has been true throughout America's existence, but perhaps no more so than in the year 1776."
5,George vs Goliath,"The world's mightiest navy (and its army) is just offshore ready to stamp out the fledgling American uprising. A true ""David vs Goliath"" confrontation. Battle after battle is lost. Soldiers in rags, no shoes and demoralized. You get a real feeling for the long shot odds for America's success. And you also see George Washington's boldness and determination and marvel at the turning of the tides.This is another book where ""schoolbook historical events"" are so well brought to life that you can't help but be hit with the enormity of those long ago actions and so thoroughly impressed by those who performed them: if things had worked out just a little differently we might be living in a much different world today."
3,good read,The book wasn't bad for a textbook. It was certainly no Deukenmeir wills but it was better than any commercial law textbook.
5,Start Dreaming Mr. Ray,This is a wonderful cd for children. It teaches things while there singing . All Mr. Ray's cd's are GREAT. I would reccomend all of them especially the DVD.
3,Book has been debunked as a lie,This book has been debunked and exposed to be a complete lie. Funny how people see what they want in writings yet completely deny the facts when presented with them. It sounds all well and good but researching the material for oneself will reveal that this is just another bunch of propaganda in the overflowing world of 'holocaust' suffering.
3,Good preview to USMLE 1,"This book is good for second year medical students taking Step 1 of the USMLE. It's a concise and comprehensive text of what you'll need to know for Step 1. If you understand the material in this book, you will do alright on Step 1. The information could be better organized (and it's not fully comprehensive), but otherwise this book is well recommended."
1,Beginning Cooks Only?,"This is the first time I have ever been motivated to write a review. I found this to be a complete waste of money. I own the wonderful original ""Cook's Catalogue"" with James Beard as one of the editors, and have referred to it frequently over many years. This ""new version"" might be helpful if you are completely inexperienced in the kitchen. Otherwise, direct your spending $$$ towards a nice saucepan."
4,Who needs a Dummy book.....,"I was given The New Cooks' Catalogue last Christmas and it was one of the best gifts I ever received. Good thing I was also on vacation at the time, because I was swallowed up by the amount of information it contained. There's a lot to digest, but it's fascinating. Loved the recipes. What's interesting is that many of the leading food writers contributed to this essential reference book. Next Christmas, I know what I'll be giving all of my friends who love to cook as much as I do."
5,amazing book,"I haven't read this book in about 6 years, and during the time that I read it and today, I have been searching everywhere! I don't remember much of the story, but I remember that there were wonderful details. It was a captivating read, and the only book I have spent so much time looking for! Must read for paranormal readers! This was one of the first books that I read from an author I was unfamiliar with, and helped me to risk reading books from different authors."
3,Ibiza Euphoria by Matt is better.,"Some good songs overall but the mixing can be better honestly. A few times I listened and cringed thinking, that mix was not very good! Or that song doesnt flow well into the next song."
5,"One of the best books I have read, and I have read a few.","Deng is as good a writer as he is a diplomat. He combines history with poetry, music, and folklore. The writing is clear, and Deng does not assume that his reader is already a scholar of the Horn of Africa. This epic -- almost 600-page -- book is as valuable for its prose as it is for its analysis of the civil war in the Sudan. I read this whole thing in less than a week."
1,Tiny don't buy,This is so small for the money don't buy Not worth it! It couldnt be any amaller!The photo is mis leading ! Very small
3,THE OSCAR,"if you like mellodrama, and you like campy, you will love this movie. it should be listed as a cult movie"
3,Not the most convincing effort,"Although the characters and story are good enough, Ms. Hunt set this thriller in an alternate present, but left out any plausible technology to support it: The weapons, vehicles and communications are all a bit absurd.What ex-FBI agent would use such a ridiculous, huge, ungainly gun as a .50-caliber automatic? Why would electric vehicles ever become popular if they were limited to 40 miles per hour? What the heck is a ""flash drive"" supposed to be? What kind of digital camera uses a ""pixel card?""This technical silliness undermines the entire story, at least for anyone with even a passing interest in science fiction or technology.For science fiction with a plausible edge, I would recommend such incredible works as Snow Crash (by Neil Stephenson).If you care at all about technology, avoid books like this, where the author badly needed either to do more basic homework or to get a better editor. Ms. Hunt would have done a lot better staging her story in the real world."
2,"Well, it does something, but totally not worth the asking price...","If You are a guy, spend a bit more and get Jean Paul Gaultier face scrub - don't waste your money on that brand.I am looking for a bit cheaper face scrub solution and tried this one 15 minutes ago... not happy. I also tried Shiseido white... a bit better than this crap, but faaaar from great. This stuff is cheaply made. It's too watery and effect is very poor. You will have to use it 2 times at least to get more or less satisfying result. This product I'll use for body wash in summer days. It smells terrible enough, but leaves no scent on skin (that's why 2 stars not 1) :)."
4,Easy to learn,"I have Michel Thomas' courses in Italian and German. Both are excellent, especially the German. His French one is also terrific, employing the same method of learning the structure of a language. Thomas is also superb at showing the tremendous similarities between English and French - and that is extremely helpful. It shows English speakers that French isn't such a foreign language after all. My only quibble with his French CD is the female student who is sometimes too slow in getting a point and often far too theatrical. She's a bad match with the male student who tries hard and isn't prone to moans of pleasure when he does something right."
1,Wasted 6 hours,The product just didn't work in most any detail. And things began to happen to this Vista computer I'm working on. Is this incompatible? I don't know. Their phone service doesn't answer. I bought it at Office Depot and I'm taking it back there. I don't care.
5,Great router,Great router and does not take up a lot of space! Fairly easy set-up for someone who isn't every techy.
1,might need to put it on a light switch,"Since I bought this one it has had to be reset at least once a day. It will be fine then it just drops it's wireless connection. I tried firmware update, and many many fixes on the web. There are so many fixes for this router on the web, why, because it doesn't work. So the only fix I know of is to put it on a light switch so that it gets reset several times a day, or well I just went back to my old slow reliable wireless B."
1,Poor product-even worse support,Bought this to replace a broken Linksys router. After going through set-up it would reach the point of verifying internet connection & claim my ISP username or password was not working. Tried calling customer support for help & their answer was to repeatedly ask if I had internet access. Checked the cables 3 times before telling them never mind that I'd be returning the product.
4,Works but needs a little work!,"Hey if you have this WBR-1310 router and are having trouble with your connection dropping (say every 10-20 minutes) check out this link as a solution to your problem. I've had no issues with connectivity since doing this and otherwise the router is doing everything it's supposed to.[...]Just one minor hiccup (fault really) that can be got around so you can have a cheap, reliable router!"
2,"Run, Dont walk away from this one !","If you are looking for a high quality piece of junk look no furthur. Besides having the worst software I've seen, when it does work it's dreadfully slow (not scanning, just warming up to scan.)Couple that with a terrible 90 day warranty and poor tech support (sorry HP, I just don't speak Hindu) this must be one of the worse computer items I have ever purchased.This will be the last HP product that I purchase, next scanner will be a epson, visioneer, canon, anything but a HP !"
2,Pole not tall enough,"Beautiful heavy fabric, but the pole was too short and the noise of it hitting the top of the car was so annoying I pulled over on the freeway to take it out of the window. Would be better if it came in different lengths. I ended up cutting off the flag and using it for something else."
4,Anyone have a list of ALL the songs played in the movie?,It'd give us a chance to burn a couple of CD's and make our own version of the entire soundtrack!
5,Almost ME!!,"i love this movie. I have looked for the collectors box set, but that was too much scratch for what I have. I got the movie fairly (postal service here sucks) promptly, in excellent condition. This film re-creates my growing up in music. At 14 I went to Woodstock 69. My first tour was not long after that at sixteen. Rock On!!"
4,Wild!,"I've been a fan of anime for many years and this is another great short series. Lots of action, suspense, and romance. Anyone who likes anime shows will want to watch this one!"
5,Great Comparison and Contrast of KJV vs Other English Versions,"This book does a very good job of comparing and contrasting the details surrounding the KJV and other English versions. When all the information is reviewed and analyzed without prejudice, the KJV stands out as the version that God kept and purified for the English language. Every church leader needs to read this book with an open heart and respond to God's leading regarding the English version of the Bible which most accurately and purely provides a view into the original transcripts."
5,Beetle Juice,"On another world very much like ours, people deal with various problems in several distinct ages. The characters are genuinely likeable and even heroic. You kind of forget they're bugs, mostly. There is almost a renaissance flavor to one of the periods. Well crafted in the true spirit of a great story. One of my all time favorites."
4,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the of the Del Rey July 1984 paperback editionCover art by Don DixonLife had become too interesting on one world crawling across the rubble-strewn arm of a spiral galaxy, for as the system moved it swept up cosmic dust and debris. Ice ages and periods of tropical warmth followed one another very quickly. Meteors large and small fell constantly. Yesterday's fabled culture might be tomorrow's interesting hole in the ground.But society had always endured. Many thought it always would. Only the brightest scientists admitted that to survive, the race would have to abandon the planet. And to do that they'd have to invent spacecraft..."
3,Does not come with guitar cable...,"I just received this awesome pedal today and was very let down that it does not come with a guitar cable, I felt like that was a poor decision by zoom to exclude one, so I had to go out and dish out an extra $20 at the local guitar center to get an ok cable. It was a huge let down especially since I thought I would be able to use the pedal right out the box, not the case, but after that, everything was cool, the pedal is great, just doesnt include a cable, not a big deal if you already own two cables, but i do not. I'm really not sure why I thought it would come with one, but I figured it would since that is something you would need in able to use it..."
3,zoom gx1 muli-effects guitar pedal,"It's ok for its low price, but don't expect miracles. The amp models are stretch. I was disapointed that the Fender and Marshall amp settings were not more like the real thing. I guess it's impossible to get tube tone from chips. You can get some real nice tones out of this and have a lot of fun playing around with it. If could have, I would have paid a little more and gotten something better. The wah sound is pretty weak and their are too many metal tones, instead of more clean and/or partly clean tones."
4,Many effects good sound,I bought this for my son and he is very happy with it and uses it both for guitar and vocals.
5,portable induction cooktop,came right on time.....works fantasticboils water (cold) in under 6 min.........with minimum heat around pan.......will be great in the summer...not heating up the kitchen.
4,Like it - still,"We have two and do all our cooking on them. That's not bad for a family of five. The cooktop is a little noisy, but it doesn't bother us at all. It's actually a good thing to know when the cooker is on. We prefer these induction cookers over our old electric stove.They are still working well after 6 months of heavy use."
3,Works but problems,"The Athena 6000 Max Burton Induction Cooker is a mixed performer. The unit smelled when I first got it and continued to for a week or two after. Something in it was out gassing. Couldn't be good to breath whatever it was.The unit had a fan, presumably to cool the electronics. It worked for a couple of weeks and no longer does so. I presume that if I used the cooker for a long time that the electronics would fail. As I use it only to cook eggs for a few minutes . . . it continues to function . . . for about a month now.The induction part of it works fine heating an iron skillet quickly and with good control over the heat. The cooker has six heat levels . . . something that was hard to get out of the marketing info at the time I bought the unit."
4,Great Portable Cooktop,"Good portable cooktop provided you have ferrous metal pots and pans. Every time you remove the pan from directly on the surface, the unti beeps, then shuts off. Make sure you have a MINIMUM 20A plug. This unit will oveload and trip a 10A plug.Easy to clean and store. Quick delivery and great customer service from the manufacturer."
3,"Great For Boiling Water, Lacks Control For Other Tasks","The device is fantastic for boiling water! This is why I bought the burner, and I'm very satisfied with it for this purpose. Boiling water for pasta, blanching, or kettle use is a breeze, and significantly faster than my gas stovetop.I had hoped it would be useful as a general purpose cooktop; it is not. It does not offer enough control for other cooking. The burner is all on or all off during the different power settings, and this results in uneven heat distribution in cast iron (both ""bare"" and enameled), as well as in high-end clad pans. The discrete power settings prevent precise tuning of temperature and heating for a simmer, meaning sauces and soups will probably either get too cool or boil."
2,Not for long term,"I purchased this item at the end of Jan 09. From the day it arrived it would randomly come up with an error that the book says needs to be unplugged to reset. I thought that it was OK to deal with this, reflecting back I don't know why. The cooktop has many neat features such as temperature control and timer so it shuts off after cooking for the time you set, which is great for someone that forgets the water is boiling until it is half gone. It boils water faster than any method I found.The story ends this way, It is the end of October 09 and the unit blows a fuse if it is plugged in. Less than a year with a couple of months that it was not used is hardly a good product in my view. I would not purchase this model again, yet the concept of using induction cooking is awesome and I would choose a brand that has a better guarantee. This is ideal if you want a low cost test on what the technique is like, which is awesome."
4,A Good But Low Output Cooktop,"This is a good cooktop, but its limitations should be understood. First, its output is equivalent to a 6000 BTU/HR gas burner, about the same as the smallest burner on a gas range. Note that this is far less than the ""11,500"" BTU/HR mistakenly claimed by another reviewer.As such, it will handle small cooking jobs only. A quart or so of water boils quickly, but it will not handle the several quarts needed in a pasta pot, for example. That said, it does a nice job on small quantities of most anything, such as warming a jar of marinara sauce or frying a couple of eggs. In addition, its temperature control feature is nothing short of wonderful, making it great for chocolate or for holding a nicely controlled simmer.With these limitations in mind, it's a nice addition to our kitchen."
5,Best Countertop Induction ever,"I was introduced to induction cooking about 3 years ago. I have a new JenAir gas cooktop that is now hardly ever used......induction is so much faster and easier to control cooking temps. My previous unit was rated at 1400 watts, and I was amazed at how fast it boiled water, cooked pasta, etc. What a surprise when I upgraded to Max Burton 6000, which is rated at 1800 watts. It is even faster and easier to control than my previous unit (Mr Induction 1400 watt), which I still use when cooking two items at the same time. Highly recommended!"
3,Practicly the same game over and over again!,Not good on graphics. Puzzles are ok not much on the think tank if you know what I mean. Great game if you want something to do on your work breaks if you need something to stay busy but don't want to be thinking about an RPG all day. LOL
1,Abysmal singing,"The singing on this recording is abysmal!The singer sings off-key often and his voice lacks power and flexibility. This recording makes painful listening, and I'll be disposing it through 2nd hand stores very soon. Just a waste of money."
5,Well-worth the money you spend,"Not my favorite of his albums (that would have to be Voice) but still a very worthy 5 stars. Highlights include: That's Amore, Nothing Sacred, The Pearl Fishers' Duet, La danza, The Best That Love Can Be. Orchestra arrangements are (as usual) solid if not spectacular. All in all, buy this album. It's well worth however much money you spend. Peace out."
1,The failure of Russell Watson,"The chief failure of Russell Watson is that his singing is uncommunicative. He seems to think that good singing must be loud. As a result, his performances are insensitive to the extreme. There's no subtlety in his renditions of the music, some of which are poorly arranged.A shame of an album!"
5,Russell Watson!,"Watson's voice was made in heaven. Watson has never sounded better with his uncharacteristic softness of delivery on the classical tracks. He reveals a reflective sensitivity that is both tender and virile. The musical arrangements provide a showcase for ""that voice"" that is never distracting.My favorite cuts are 'That's Amore"" and ""La danza"". I have always appreciated Russell Watson's rich tenor voice and turn of lyric, but his softer side is a revelation that is beyond superlatives. If you don't already have this CD as part of your collection you have yet to discover the full character of one of our greatest interpreters of song."
5,"Took a chance with this Cd, no regrets","I took a chance on purchasing this cd, and the gamble paid off.It definitely has everything.Orchestration is in top form and I can envision the wonderful Watson belting these songs out in the studio."
1,I can only speak to one track,"I have an odd hobby: I collect recorded versions of ""Au Fond Du Temple Saint"" the duet from ""The Pearl Fishers"" by Bizet. My only comment is that while Mr. Watson may have a passable voice, his rendition of ""Au Fond Du Temple Saint is abominable. Not only has he egotistically attempted to sing both parts of a Tenor/Baritone duet, he has used an arrangement that destroys the beauty of the song. On top of all of that, the final climactic line in which the two friends pledge to be such even to death has been altered, for God knows what reason to mean something else alltogether. If you are a fan of Mr. Watson, you no doubt will like this CD. If, on the other hand you are a fan of the music that he sings, you may have a different opinion."
1,A vocal wreck,I can only use 3 words to describe this album - a vocal wreck. The singing is abominable. Can't be recommended at all.
5,Finally discovered Watson,I did not know anything about Russell Watson until my husband gave me this CD for Christmas. I did not listen to it until a couple of weeks ago. I love every song on this CD and I wonder why he has not toured the USA. I am now purchasing his first CDs and I agree with the other reviews that he does have an amazing voice.
3,OK for a start,"There is a significant difference between this (their first album) and the subsequent release: ""Shadows Are Security."" Overall, FWC is ok, for a start. (You have to cut them a little bit of a break since this was their first album). The only people who give this 5 stars are probably already raving AILD fans. Yes, there are a couple cool tracks but not enough to carry the album.If you're new to the band (or new to Metalcore), don't start with this record. ""Shadows Are Security"" and ""An Ocean Between Us"" are both MUCH better.Not recommended (unless you're already an AILD fan)."
3,meh,"this is cd is very average but w/ good drumming im giving this 3 stars because there were pretty good at ozzfest that is why i purchased the album; instead check out megadeth, black dahlia murder, gizmachi, american head charge, mudvayne or even rage against the machine"
4,Good....Thats it.,"Ok,i just checked out this band and downloaded this whole cd(not determined to buy it yet).This is not death metal it's border line melodic but over it's hardcore/metalcore,Cannibal Corpse,Nile,Morbid Angel,those are death metal bands. I must say these guys are pretty cool though they're music is pretty good and their drummer is damn good. But if u want talent check out bands like dream theater and symphony and for speed drumming check out some newer dimmu(nick barker is fast) and soem true death metal.good cd,better for hardcore/metalcore fans."
5,Good Stuff,"A band that gets on a label like Metal Blade must be good, and they are. Yes they are very Sick in concert and this CD is amazing. Also check out ""Glass Casket"" and ""Between the Burried and Me""."
1,Redundant and poorly executed,"If you're expecting any innovation whatsoever, do not buy this CD. So many bands are already attempting to emulate a once unique early 90's Gothenburg composition style, and quite frankly none of them can pull it off correctly. If you're going to listen to melodic death metal, check out Dismember, Grave or Carnage. Don't waste your time and money on rehashed ""metalcore."""
2,No Emo please,"Um, I had to review because ""slayer dude"" is way off. First off, I am disappointed with AILD. Why the Emo breakdowns? Metalcore and Emo are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, why mix 'em? I love older AILD, but will never buy this album. Secondly, here's ""slayer dude"" criticizing the lyrics, religion, and everything else about AILD when he listens to Deicide and Acacia Stain....hmmmm. Deicide coudn't make an album without heavy technical tweaking and they use the same riffs in nearly every song.(I would know, I use to listen to them in'90-91 and it got old a loooong time ago) Dont get me started on the songwriting. AILD was and is a very talented band, but they are just a little mis-guided at the moment. If you like whining, you will like this album."
2,William Faulkner's followup to The Sound and the Fury.,"Or was it 'The Sound and the Fury' is the follow-up to 'Absalom, Absalom!' Faulkner is a real pompous art-for-the-sake-of-art author. The stream of conciousness style of writing is INTERESTING but doesn't make for much of an enjoyable reading. 'Sutree' by Cormac McCarthy has a similar prose that he uses in certain passages for strictly the sake of describing the environment that the characters find themselves in. Cormac makes his story so tangible and the surroundings are tragic in a beautiful sort of way. Back to Faulkner, you have to give him credit for his lack of punctuation and his consistant change of subject from line to line. Congrats to Faulkner for what I imagine is another confusing bit of pretentious art literature. Metalcore is for poontangs."
3,pretty good,"Honestly im not blown away by this album but its deffinately a good one. Im a huge fan of as i lay dying and their breakdowns are insane. I do recommend this cd. Also if your looking for other great cd's i also recommend ""The Black Dahlia Murder, Unearth, It Dies Today, and Bleeding Through"". You wont be dissapointed."
2,I could not get into this book,"I was bored, it was preachy and I did not end up finishing it. I've heard it has helped some people's marriages but for us it wasn't very helpful."
1,catherine coulter cd collection....,"could not even get interested in listening to these stories...I was disappointed as I paid !4.99 for the set to listen to in bed,"
3,Very impressive - with one MAJOR flaw,"There is a lot to recommend in this book. Bevere makes a compelling case for filtering all of one's thoughts, words and actions through the light of eternity. Good stuff! And he writes better than most. Why just three stars, then? For a major doctrinal flaw. Bevere devotes one entire chapter to his conviction that it is possible to lose one's salvation by one's actions. His ""proof"" of this contention is utterly unconvincing, as any teaching outside Christian orothodoxy would be. I was flabbergasted - if he's wrong about this, what else is in error? It's difficult to recommend for this reason alone. The book with the offending chapter excised would be worth five stars, easily."
4,Great Gift,This was a great gift. I gave it to my co-worker and she has been loving it. Each day she gives me an update on where she is in the book and others in her family are now interested in buying the book. She was so into the book one day on her way home on the train that she missed her stopped and ended up in another town!
3,Better on Television,"This book was good, but seemed to have less of an anointing than listening to John Bevere talk about his experiences while writing it."
3,Warm Christmas Memories,"I grew up with the Carpenters for Christmas. This cd will kindle a flame of hope and joy in every heart! The songs made every holiday (and the anticipation!) warm and tender. Karen Carpenter sings with the sincerity and joy of someone truly in love with the Christmas season. I would recommend this cd to anyone looking to bring back the joy and nostalgia of childhood Christmas, warm fires and cuddling up with your favorite person to revel in the joy of Christmas."
3,Not Exactly What You Think It Will Be,"I purchased this CD in a bargain bin, nonetheless, thought it was a collection of Christmas songs performed by the Carpenters. Not exactly. What it is, is the soundtrack to their Christmas television special from the 70's. Sure there is plenty of Christmas music, but not always performed by Karen Carpenter. There are musical sequences such as an 8 minute overture and a Nutcracker Suite, that while are lovely in their own right, aren't Carpenters music. Still, if you can accept that aspect, it is an infectious holiday collection that does contain many Carpenter classic renditions of standards. And Karen was exquisite performing songs such as Merry Christmas Darling and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. There are also productuion numbers with a chorus where you can practically smell the Bob Mackie gowns. Overall its about 70 minutes of well done Christmas music."
5,Still the best.,"Not as good as when Dr. Braunwald did it all by himself, but still the best Cardiology textbook on the market."
5,Very nice bedding,"My husband and I love this bedding. It's definitely a huge step up from the Bed-in-a-Bag we had before. The color combination is really striking, and it's bright enough that I like it, but it's masculine enough to suit my husband's tastes. I love the lining on the inside of the comforter - it feels like a nice, soft sheet. And of course, the microsuede is so luxurious and soft! I like, too, that the comforter isn't too, too thick. It's just thick enough to feel warm, but not so thick that you're suffocating. I think we'll be able to use it all year if we want to. We bought a set of chocolate-colored sheets to go with it, and it's gorgeous. I think tan sheets would look nice, too."
5,Wonderful book,I was able to find all 3 books by the author here and it is a great find. A must have for any serious needlepointer. The shipment was quick and the book was in wonderful condition.
1,Don't Do It!!!,"Bad product! I would have been happy to have got the 4 mo. out of it, I returned to the store 3 times in 9 mo. Now I sit with a table weight, since it is good for nothing else and the store has discontinued it...surprize surprize. Magnavox should just take it off the market and save us all the hassle and lost money.Walt"
1,VHS Tapes are a Yummy Snack!!!!,I had this machine a little over 6 months and the VCR portion has started chowing on VHS tapes while recording. The last time it ruined the play head and now the machine will not play tapes. I called Magnavox the warranty was only 90 Days and for a few $$$ over what I paid for the device I can ship it back to them for a replacement.What a rip off. Phillips and Magnavox are now on my DO NOt Buy List!!
4,1/2 and 1/2,"I HAVE HAD THIS FOR 3 WEEKS AND IT IS A REFURB....SO FAR IT WORKS FINE BUT THE REMOTE DOES NOT IS THERE ANY THING I CAN DO ABOUT THIS? IF SO PLEASE TELL ME... SO, I AM NOT THRILLED BECAUSE I CANT DO THINGS MANUALLY LIKE FF OR PAUSE OR ?? ETC.. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ON THE BOX ITSELF ...SO I MUST WAIT AND WATCH IT ANY WAY"
4,Prep book for space exploration,"This book is easy to read and is a must for any fan of space travel. The book format uses one line questions followed up with an answer of a paragraph or two. The great thing is that the questions cover EVERY aspect of life in outer space that you can imagine - sleeping, hygene, eating, going to the bathroom, bleeding, clothing and back pain! There is also a great chapter which gives tips on what it takes to get into the space program. Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down!"
4,"A little outdated, but nice on Kindle","This is a very light and interesting read. The Q&A; format makes it a very easy reading, especially for younger space fans. All aspects of space (shuttle) flight are covered. My only issue is that it needs an updated edition. This is a 1995 book, and references about the ""future"" international space station sounds dated. Also some of the statistics could be brought up to date.The Kindle edition is well formatted, no problems here, and graphics ans pictures are preserved.Overall a 4 star reading for space enthusiasts."
3,A great book full of useful hints and tips,"First of all, this book works! It is a concept based book which will take it's reader to a high income rate. The book explains the ways in which to sucessfully market a product and many many other ways to build up your bank balance. If you want to make lots of money on the internet then you should buy this book."
5,"bread, soup, and cake","When I lived in New Haven, my favorite lunchtime place was Claire's Corner Copia. My favorite lunch was soup, a mini loaf of bread and carrot cake with butter cream frosting. The frosting was so popular, it was kept in a bucket, and the staff would scoop out a giant portion and slather it on the cake. I'm so glad I can make it from this cookbook now that I'm on the west coast and can't make my weekly trek to Claire's. And the soup! I never had a bad one--they were all great, and they're here, too. Get this book and also Claire's Italian Feast. If you can't get to the restaurant, these recipes are the next best thing."
1,Who cares?,"I found this book extremely tedious and poorly written, and I did not care about ANY of the characters. Don't waste your time!"
5,Nice grease...,So far so good. Works as advertised and seems to be cleaner solution to the other forms of standard grease.
5,An Award Winner!,"""Beyond the Mountains of Madness"" won the Origins award for Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1999. That about says it all!"
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I purchased this as a bedroom television. While it is satisfactory, I am disappointed that the volume does not go as low as it should and as I would like it to be for bedroom use. The picture is okay (ony if you're looking at it straight on, not from the side)--the colors (no matter how many adjustments I've made) are not true in comparison to other televisions in my home. It will do, but I will be far more attentive to all these factors next time around. Given the drawbacks, is it worth $324.? Not at all."
1,Suspicious Reviews - Possible Fakes?,"As another reviewer mentioned - the ""five star"" reviews for this book are most probably fake. I looked up their other reviews, and there are none! Go figure!This padding of reviews ruins the entire Amazon reviewer process. Believe me, a good book will rise on its own merit. I did a sample of this book, and it's not very good."
2,Make sure you get the real thing,"The company that makes the highly rated version of this speaker is ""Pacific Rim Technologies"" but there are multiple cheap knockoffs of their design from companies like ""Pacific Image Electronics."" Make sure you're getting the real thing before you buy.You can buy the real thing for $19 from the Pacific Rim Technologies Web site and it includes an AC adapter. Those are great speakers for the money. The $5 knockoffs are junk."
1,Wrong Item,"I guess I'll never be sure about what I think about this system because this vendor sent me a ""knock-off"" item made by a different company. Stay away from this company."
3,harvard scholars,"The book is well written and raises some moral questions, but is it possible to trust to a narrator (or, for that matter, Ignatieff) who does not know that the border Slovakia-Hungary-Ukraine DOES NOT exist, mainly because one of those countries is thousands of miles away from the other two; or, that Omarska is not even close to the river Drina (Bosnia and Herzegovina); or, that there are NO baroque churches in Central Serbia, etc, etc. Well, and the guy is a Harvard scholar... And, allegedly, he was in the region, too..."
4,YOU WILL NEED AN EXTINGUISHER !!!,"My MAIN MAN....the laidback and too-cool-for-words G-child Warren Griffith, who I've loved since 1990s childhood. In his Snoop affiliations, much like Kurupt and Nate Dogg, We all got to know him well-early on ago.An immaculate talent, with a memorable and very listenable voice, and an ear for shaping previously embellished classic funk, into clean, yet street-smart grooves.Note: Just get all his CDs all the way up to ""Return of the Regulator"". Not much real good after that one.Most Notable tracksBack UpYoung FunWhat We Go Through Hoorah for 'Bad Azz' and the other guy was awesome...TransformersSmokin' Me OutI Shot The Sherriff"
4,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - a great place to start,"I read this book as a teenager, borrowing it from my fathers bookshelf. And that was a while ago, so perhaps four stars seems a bit much. But this was my first foray into the espionage genre and I haven't slowed down. It was a look into a supremely exciting, albeit grim business. I doubled back afterwards to read le Carres earlier works, then on to all of Helen MacInness espionage books and through all of Clancys and so on. And whenever I find a le Carre book I haven't read, I correct that immediately. I don't think there are any. I give TTSS four stars because I remember it as the wonderful adventure that started me on this terrific road. I can't get it on my Kindle, so I'm re-reading it in paperback."
3,Slow paced. Good book but had to battle through it a bit.,This was a good book. However it was very slow to start and at times I was wondering what the point was. I battled through it because it came so highly recommended. It's ok.
1,BORING,This was one of the most boring books I have read. Couldn't finish. The new movie is just as bad. Don't recommend at all.
2,too confusing,"with codenames, etc ... Too many identification for each person makes it hard to follow.. Written in too much of the British style of old"
1,Matthew,"I have not been able to figure why this author is considered such a wonderful writer. AS usual he never gets on with the damn story. Boring, boring, and boring. I cannot call this great reading. Total waste of time. It is the first time I ever just threw a book into the trash bin to be preserved in a landfill. Maybe I am not cool enough to appreciate such drivel and pleasantly so!"
4,difficult book to read,"I found the book hard to read , so i read the first third and the end and found it to be a very good book....I don;t think i missed much in the middle of the book..."
4,Intregue,Read the book before you see the move a great read it provides the intrigue of the world of the English spy service
4,Looking for the vidio,"This is my 3rd reaking of this book, an it still holds its own.... But, as I recall, either Masterpiece, or Mystery on PBS did a 3 or 4 part seris of this novel, starring Sir Alec Guiness, and I'm trying to find out where I can buy it... Any sugestions??"
1,Certainly a Tinker,"In his Smiley sequel, this bloke has filled countless pages with the most boring stuff. He cannot hold my attention for more than a few phrases at a time. Mr. LeCarre writes like a pedant and probably is one, fills the cliche of Honorable Schoolboy, that's why he could fill page after page with nonsense maintaining best behavior with a straight face. There is no doubt that he is a Tinker, less Tailor or Soldier, failed lousy as Spy. gerborg"
5,Great Movie,"Having lived in the town that this movie took place it, it really portrayed what happened a long time ago, with a twist. Great, great movie."
2,This has been done to death,The movie is well made but how many times can they make a movie about city folks moving into a farm and stir up local ghosts? I'd give the movie a higher mark if not for dozens of movies I have already seen with the same old premise. I heard that it's based on a real legend but this is not good enough reason to make a movie about it.
4,Runs my VOIP server,"I installed my VOIP server in this case, because it's thin and can be tucked away easily. The ONLY thing I don't like about it, is the onboard fan is LOUD. i replaced it, and it's a quiet little powerhouse. This case is solid too, so expect some weight. I love the hard drive/optical drive cage and the built-in power supply."
3,Entertaining but too drawn out,"I enjoyed the book even though I found it too long. However, the plot was interesting enough to keep me going through the too-detailed explanations of Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" which served as the guide for the quest the characters are completing. Although somewhat complex and predictably contrived it was a good story.Character development was good for the novel's narrator Ottavia, but less so for supporting characters Farag and the Captain.I would recommend it to people who enjoy this type of story.NOTE: I read the book in Spanish, so I cannot attest to the quality of the transalation."
2,Biased Author,I hoped to learn about bombing as a military/social tactic and instead felt I received a pacifist-distorted view. If he changed the title to 'All war is Bad' it would be more apropos to the content. Also they are guilty of evaluating historical behavior with a contemporary viewpoint instead of in context. For a citizen of a country that sat out WWII to accuse others of deliberately attacking the wrong targets in Germany is untenable. Makes me ashamed of my Swedish heritage but proud my ancestors left.
2,Useful But Silly In Parts,"Some useful information but a lot of research and work wasted. The author has obviously worked hard on this but after laying out bits of history, he lapses into socio-babble and post-modernist claptrap. It's obvious that he had a pre-formed thesis in mind when he started and tortuously bends history to fit it. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
4,Nice basic solution for docking your PSP,I was tired of connecting my PSP to my PC and then put it on top of my desk. I felt it was going to scratch or fell to the floor anytime. So I went ahead and bought this little marvel. It does its job pretty good. When recharging the PSP it lights up a dimmed blue/grayish point in the base of the dock. You can't be happier these days paying 10 bucks for a PSP accessory and receive a good performance item.
1,A Bit Absurd,"I have been in college for 4 years. I couldn't relate to anything in this book. I don't know who this book if for, but it is not for undergraduates.I cannot recomend it."
5,Mastering the impossible and their destiny,"Great book - a definite if you're a fan. There are lots of photos, but lots of text to really follow their journey with them - Read it and you'll appreciate the hopefulness they bring us all - can't wait to go see the show again. Would buy this book again - I bought one for me, one for a gift - it's super!"
2,NOT Recommended,.The movie must have been made by the PC-Committee & the I-hate-America clowns. It does NOT focus on the battle of Haditha at all but rather on a single incident of that bloody town. It puts Americans down and the Iraqis glorified.The movie has nothing to do with the title except location.SF
4,well written and enjoable reading,I enjoyed this book. It was interesting to take a look at Jewel's childhood and her history. I would have liked to have had a few more qoutes and even a review from Jewel on how accurate the book portraited her. I would like know if I can beleive all that I am reading because it seems like people can exagerate and underestimate things when they are writing about someone else. It sounded all true.
2,not worth the money,I found so many editing errors in this book and it was like any other book of poetry. boring and too long and not interesting enough to hold my attention. i am sorry i spent my money on this book.
4,Music to paint by,When I paint I always have music playing. This is delightful and inspirational when I am working on abstracts.
1,Poor!,"Projector images were so poorly lit that I had to hold the thing a few inches away from the wall in order to make out what the images were. At this point it became a useless purchase. To make maters worse, the motor that turns the image carousel round and round inside is SO loud that I don't see how this thing could be considered a sleep aid. Not worth the shipping charge to send it back either. Do yourself a favor and keep looking."
5,Great video series,These are wonderful. My son has watched #1 & #4. He really loves them and they are teaching him words. Best of both worlds - fun and educational.
4,Solid Amp,"Good amp. Hooked up to a MTX 5500 12'' Sub. Wired the amp in bridged and is giving the sub 200 watts at 4 ohms. I'm using 8 gauge power connections and it works well. A bass knob is extra, and would be nice. At the price I paid I can't complain. Im using the high-level speaker inputs. They work well and are nearly distortion free. Don't forget to connect the black ground wire of the high-level speaker harness if you're using it to the ground cable, or the output will be very limited.The chrome design is nice, and the blue lights are a great touch. It doesn't get too hot, but I haven't used it in the summer yet. Compared to my MTX 7801 1600 watt RMS amp, it compares well for the price. Granted its a much smaller amp and in 2 completely different classes. I would buy another one to have on hand if the price dropped any further."
1,"The archetypal 80s artist: dull, mediocre, pretentious","While Schnabel's latter day ressurection as a cinéaste (Basquiat, Antes que Anochezca) has proved he has a modicum of intelligence, his 'art' was just so much product for 80s New Yorkers - it has not a whit of imagination, irony, vision, truth, beauty - anhything, in fact, that might cause it to linger in the mind. Whatever their flaws (and they are legion) Koons and Serrano are Titans compared to this dross"
3,Incomplete Movie...!,"The movie stops in the middle of the story. TinTin gets all the 3 maps and the movies is over....! My son is extremely very angry on this incomplete movie. If the movie is based on a story book called ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" then it must complete the whole story other wise they should NOT release this video. The Amazon.com customer service also refused me to take return this VHS and refund my money. It is not only disappointing, it is frustrating. They says it is only 30 minutes coverage of the story. My question to them, If you do NOT have a complete movie ready according to the story book, then why are you selling this VHS ?"
3,cheap basic rails,"The common cheap style rail that has existed for as long as i been working with and building PCs (over 25 years).They work, but no special features (like having screws at the exact place drives would so newer cases that lock onto that kind of thing lock). But managed to get them into new modern cases with a good screw kit.Nothing special, if they are not more than $5 go a head and order them. Seen better solutions out there for drive conversion, but could not find them on here that day.that shipped prime, and were in stock.that was the issue I faced so I settled for the old style cheap-o rails."
4,IT WORKS,"I used this on an older puter .I mounted a 3.5"" hard drive in an extra 5.25"" bay.It worked with the green Dell rails.I'm happy ."
3,disappointment in the size of the skeins,I Love the yarn the only disappointing thing on the site is that there is no indication of the sizes of the skeins of yarn you are ordering. After receiving the yarn I had to go back on the internet and order more and pay more shipping cost. If the seller had just told me the size of the skeins I was ordering i could have saved some money on shipping cost. i think the web site should make sellers disclose the size of the skeins of yarn when they offer them for sale.
4,An excellent information source!,"As a recently diagnosed Tourette's sufferer, I spent time looking for resources that were clear and in layman's terms. I had pleasantly found what I was looking for in "" The Unwelcome Companion"". Mr. Fowler's own experiences were actually comforting to me as I read his story. I would suggest this book, not only for Tourette sufferers themselves, but also for their loved ones that are dealing with the disease as well! I will be passing it on to my husband! Thank you, Mr. Fowler... One of the first things regarding this disease that actually made me feel better!"
3,slender but good,i thought this was good short but sweet. it could be a good starting book for sombody reasearching tourettes. i wish the author had but in more of his expiernces.
1,Not for Beginners,"The author is a former rocket scientist and the book contains many charts that the ""average"" person may find difficult to fathom. There are very few explanations for the terms used in the charts and minimal examples. The beginning player wants to know why video poker is so popular; the difference between normal slots and video poker; what are full-pay machines. If you are just starting out - don't start with this book."
2,A good stepping stone.,"I used this book in college and I was not thrilled with it. Everything is beyond crammed in the study book. The lab manual is too vague and does not enforce what the beyond crammed chapters are about. As a college graduate with my degree in Japanese, I would not recommend using this workbook for personal growth in the language. It is a good stepping stone to the Professor's lectures. I've learned more from my professors in class than from this composition book and study book. If this is being used in your college class 200'ish level, be prepared for a cram shock. The only way to truly learn this language is pay attention to your Prof and ask tons of questions like I did. Always make kanji and vocabulary cards too!"
4,"Good Buy. Quality, versatile, probably more blades than you'll ever need!","This handy little kit is a great addition to any hobbyist's tool set. Looks exactly as pictured, and has plenty of blades for any application I've managed to dream up. The best part of this kit (in my opinion) is that I still haven't snapped a single blade. I went through about 7 x-acto blades in one day a few months back, but I've yet to break a single one of the blades from this kit. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm holding one back because it's not sold by Amazon. To rectify the extra shipping costs, just order more from Parts Express :). They have some pretty great merchandise, and good prices.Good Buy, great little case, good blades!"
4,Gets the job done,"The tools and tips in this kit are great. handles are same quality as any that you'd find anywhere, the different tips ( I never even knew they had) come in handy. Having said that, the case is a "" good idea"" with the magnet lid and shapped locations for everything, but nothing really stays where its supposed to and the latch does not latch. So not something you want to leave lying around if you have little ones afoot."
5,Very sharp,I used them for my carpet on my speaker box and also of jobs around the house. They cut right through every thingand love the box they came in.
2,The Ageless Issue,"To clarify a point, if the stated date of the movie is right -- 1938 -- and the birthdate given on IBDB is right -- April 8, 1926 -- Shirley Mills would in fact have been 12."
3,"Child Bride, a fairy tale!","Interesting exhibit of how biased the screen writer/director were against ""hillbilly"" culture. The men were portrayed non workers, except at moonshine stills, they just stood around smoking and plotting against women. Not a very realistic presentation of the hill folks who were industrious and hardworking. Otherwise they would not have survived. --- Interesting how our cultural biases evolve over time!"
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED !!!,"This is NOT 18 Gauge wire its 12 gauge at best,And it is NOT 50ft More like 25ft.I surly got ripped off again at Amazon."
4,Interesting Episode!!,Ok this review is for this episode not the Recap.Great epidose! Finally we are going to know the truth. I have followed this series since Season 1. The characters have come a long way. Some have grown up and some will never change like Pope. The introduction of new characters are great and right on time. It was getting a little boring with some of the same old characters. This season started off slow but has picked up a bit with the Season Finale approaching no telling what's going to happen. Looking foward to the Finale.
4,Awesome!!,This epidode was great. It was full on suspense and surprises. I can not wait until the next episode. All the characters are great. Glad it's starting to pick up.
5,Falling Skies,"I can't wait for the third season. This is a very exciting show, and the characters are well suited for their roles."
3,need more guns,"white children with guns look cool. no, really, tell me this isnt about the white race surviving the onslaught of the other. i am not saying that western civilization should just accept its demise, but to fight for it with a gun is counterproductive. i, also, like that good guys use all kind of guns including AK-47.All kind of broadly speaking Western people should abandon their petty arguments and unite against the other.if you think that this not what this show is all about, whatch it again."
4,Main actors are developing,"Some actors are stiff in first season but director is giving freedom for actors to develope their part, special effects are very good and we know that shooting is very difficult on the road but crew is doing a great job. Shooting in rainy weather or with snow is a very natural touch and shows crew & cast dedication. Nice editing to give that end of the world climate. Unexpected cliffhanger but the problem now is the 3 season is not released yet of this date Nov 2012"
5,Action packed series that keeps you engaged,A hidden gem worth watching. The series explores several aspects of huminity in the context of a sifi setting that mosy anyone would enjoy.
5,Falling Skies,"Great suspense, drama and character interaction...can't wait to see 3rd season to see how the story and plot thickens around each of the primary characters!"
5,Great tv show,This tv show is up there with The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones for me. Has a good story over all its a good show.
3,The Writers Got Lost,"I thought the characters were interacting interestingly and growing in very human ways, then the story and characters collapsed as they rushed to a forced conclusion. All the character development of the series was wiped out in the last few episodes."
5,Another great Sci-Fi show... Lets just hope they don't cancel it!,"Falling Skies is good Sci-Fi series that depicts an end of the world alien invasion scenario. Who cares if the acting or the special effects are not the ""best to date"" (which it is really not that bad). Its the content and story that matter the most in my opinion and this show has it. Besides, its also very pleasing to see some new actors on T.V. rather than the same old Hollywood mainstream."
4,WHY NO DVD ????,I like the shows...my daughters love it! Sure wish I could get season 2 on DVD. I dont know how to download and burn.
4,Keeps you on the edge.,I don't have extensive cable programing by choice so love streaming these series I would otherwise not have seen. For a Bug infested Sci Fi it was remarkably engaging episode after episode. Looking forward to more episodes.
4,Good sci fi drama,"I give it 4 starts because of the story line. The characters are developing as the show plays out, with more dimensions becoming apparent.The only down side is that frequently the playback to my TV is poor. This happens to me with Prime (but not Netflix)."
1,5 mass ter bation,In the south we play football up north they play skitter word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word
3,Not impresssed,Thought the story was drawn out and not fast enough moving. It is not something I would go back the second time to watch.
4,The best of the best,"For much time ago, I had wanted to buy a Tissot watch, because I think that brand is one of the best Swiss brand watches"
3,Does the job.,"A little squeeze tube (like LocTite comes in) of this stuff would have been perfect, and easy to apply as well. This is the Costco Industrial Size bottle - I only needed a little bit, and the remains had jelled by time I needed some more. Also there is a brush attached to the bottom of the lid, and the steel brush handle rusted quickly and tainted the sealant. I think most people dislike wasting resources and having to purchase four ounces, use only a few drops, then throw out a virtually full bottle because it went bad, just doesn't feel good."
3,Rich in coverage but poor in explainations.,"The coverage of this book is vast and comprehensive. It includes almost all of the important topics that practitioners and graduate students need to know.Because of the scope of this books, I think it is better used as a reference book rather than a text. To save space, many major and crucial results are only stated without proofs (This drives serious econometrics students crazy). Also, equations pop-out from nowhere sometimes and I have to scratch my head like crazy to figure them out. For instance, the material in Chapter 14 Random Effect section is poorly explained.In addition, real-data examples are of no help. The author just throws in a lot of numbers to make you wondering around how he got those numbers.I believe there is a better text out there. Consult your professors before you buy this book. It is not cheap at all. But if you need a good reference on your book shelves, this is the right one."
2,Face A/Face B,"This is my 2nd Axelle Red CD purchased. It's no way as good as ""Toujour Moi"" CD but #6 song is ok. If you have to choose between her CDs, go buy the ""Toujour Moi"" CD. That one has 3 really good songs ""Mon Futur Proche"", ""J'Ai Jamais Dit"" & ""Ce Matin.""If you just can't get enough of Axell then buy the Face A/Face B."
1,truly terrible,"maybe the one star rating is unfair, because i didn't watch the whole movie, totally bailed out at the scene where the dude's mom drops by and gives him some sex advice and a big red dildo; the camera lingers on this charming tableau for some time, with the shiny red dick held up between the faces of the mom and son. if you think that's a sidesplitting laff riot, then this movie is def for you. good luck with it."
3,does not work for ps3,"This game does not work for the ps3 slim systems....even after downloading the ps2 data to play ps2 games. It will not work. It only works for an original ps2!!WTFAs far as packaging, shipment and product. Everything was excellent. It came in a timely manner. The disc has no scratches. The case is undamaged. It is like new."
3,Very very good game,"I do like this game.The only thing I dislike about it is its narrow screen.I have a widescreen tv and this game doesn't make the best of it.However, I hope its sequence or other game like it comes to PS3 and XBOX 360."
5,An excellent behind-the-scenes study of U.S./Vichy relations,"This book was written in 1947 but is remarkably comprehensive and well researched. Apparently Mr Langer had access to gov't records that would have normally been classified for many years. His work was authorized by the State Dept., the War dept. and the former OSS. Consequently, except for the 40's writing style and vocabulary, the book has the academic chutzpah of a book written decades after an event and after volumes of classified data have been released.This book is a very thorough account of the international diplomacy that occurred mostly between the US and the various French groups (i.e. de Gaullists, Vichy, the French in North Africa etc.) and also between the US and the UK. It's an amazing book and I consider it a must-read for any student of WWII. If you liked ""The Deadly Embrace"" you'll like this."
2,This book ends as soon as it starts to get good,"This book has the potential to be an excellent book. It really does. The first 100 pages set the plot and get you excited for something really cool. Then just as it starts to get good, it ends. This book was 179 pages and it easily could have been 250. But obviously the book had to be finished by a certain time so K.A. Applegate had to just end it. That is not how a book should be written. This book gets you pumped up for an incredible climax but just as the climax starts it ends. This book should have been much longer and its lousy ending makes the whole book seem lousy. Get it only if you are a die-hard Animorphs fan."
3,Animorphs: Megamorphs #4: Back to Before,"I love the Animorphs series. However, this was not my favorite book. It wasn't very interesting to me. If you are a competely loyal, I've-read-all-the-books-at-leat-five-times Animorphs fan, you will probably like it. I, for one, found books like Megamorphs #1: The Andalite's Gift much better.In the book, Jake gets an offer from the Drode: his master, the Crayak, will make it as if the Animorphs never existed. That Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, and Marco simply took a different way home. However, there's a catch: the Yeeks still exist. Only now, they don't even know it. They never rescued Ax, and there's no one resisting the Yeerk threat. Things aren't at all like Jake had hoped..."
3,Wrong year,"These pads fit the Discovery II, years 1999.5+. amazon and Hawk show them as matches for all Discoveries but they are not."
4,Great item.,"This is a very good item if you have the whole collection (Six Faces of Madness), or you love gore."
5,Alex McFarland / Director of Teen Apologetics / Focus On the Family,"In ""Making Virginity Possible,"" Keith Deltano addresses an important topic with great effectiveness. Deltano's book is extremely helpful to parents because it gives actual strategies rather than just giving simple ""preaching."" The chapter on STD's, oral sex, and condom failure rates is eye-opening, well researched, and is amply supported with medical facts and statistics. Keith Deltano gives parents an effective tool to help fight the myth that, ""oral sex is not sex."" Youth pastors would do well to make parents and adult leaders aware of this important resource from an experienced communicator. You can clearly tell that the author presents info that is not merely theoretical, but material that has been developed through years of interaction with actual teens, adult leaders, and families. Highly recommended."
4,"Excellent Work, Though the Title Will Mislead Some","I love it- what it is is an abridgment of Spinoza's other works. Its nowhere near sufficient in itself to understand him, but will help by getting rid of the rigorous geometric-proof form of his other work.Ok, let me just describe what's in this book, so you know what your getting (for free, might i add?); it begins with a somewhat brief bio of Spinoza, followed by an extensive summery and explanation of Spinoza's philosophy, obviously from the perspective of the author. What follows this is the bulk of the book; Spinoza's philosophy reordered. Instead of the geometrical form he writes in, which can make him difficult to understand, the writer puts everything into aphorisms under three major headings-1. On God2. On Man3. On Man's Well-BeingUltimately, for what it is- an easier read of Spinoza's work- its an excellent resource."
5,Great purchase!,Local pet stores are selling the same item for $30+. I was able to purchase two for the same I would have spent at local stores! Great buy!
2,"From someone curious about Sinatra, not a die hard fan: it's OK","I have this artists in many infomercials, so I bought this CD to find more about him. Verdict: he sings well, but the songs are not of my taste. It's OK."
5,Jazz that hits all the right notes,"I'm not a musician myself, nor even particularly knowledgeable about music -- I'm more the ""I know what I like"" type. And I love this CD. I find the singer's voice very appealing and enjoy the song choices. I've given it as a gift to a number of people in my life who ARE professional musicians, and all of them have had very positive responses. So I think this is one that everyone can appreciate, from professionals and aficionados to the more casual listener like myself."
2,Not all guitar stands are made equal...,This guitar stand is very budget and it shows. Beware it does not fit acoustic guitars or Fender P or J style basses (which is what I bought it for).It does fit my Strat but the quality of the rubber is horrible in that it STINKS and I do not trust the 'industrial' compound up against my guitar finish.Next time I will pay a little extra and get something that will work.
1,What absolute trash. Don't waste your money,"Well I have to say that this album completely sucks and isn't even worth the cost of the plastic jewel box it comes in. In fact, the plastic jewel box is actually worth more! What a pile of blather. The words are trite and pretentious. The bands musical abilities are decent, but unless these guys practice 8 to 9 hours a day, for the next 5 years they will never progress past mediocre. Also, the look of the band is tired and contrite. A bunch of creeps in blacks suits and ties. Don't waste your money on this dog, it's a real loser. I gave it one star because there wasn't anything less than that."
5,Epic baseball storytelling,"This piece of work along with the follow-up ""Over the Edge"" is a must read for any baseball afficianato, especially in need of a few genuine good laughs. The way Jay tells a story really puts the reader in the moment and captures the unique humor of the game that seems to have graced years gone by. There are very few characters of the game left in what has become more of a business, but if you ever read ""Snake"", or Joe Namath's book, you'll love this one."
2,Too Bad...,"This game was hard to figure out at first. Once I did, I realized that it was a waste of money. There actually isn't much challenge to it. You try to fill in the blank spots and then the computer does. It's almost like whoever goes first gets the last turn and wins. There are shortcuts you can use, but there is no clear explanation when they can be used or what they even do. I only figured out one after the computer player kept using it on me.Don't bother getting this game. I wish I hadn't."
4,Solid Chair,"This chair is built solid. It feels amazing and provides all the comfort I was looking for. I have tried out other less expensive zero-gravity chairs and can confidently say that this one outshines the competition in quality and its therapeutic elements. However, this picture is deceiving. The color is about 5 shades darker with a hint of olive, the handles are not stained (they look a bit colored in the pic to me), and the metal is thicker than it appears. Also, I think I have to sand down the handles a bit because they are rather rough in spots. None of these things really matter aside than for aesthetic reasons, however, my heart did sink a tad because my intent was to use this at home in my living room as a reading chair."
3,Exhausting and Unmemorable,"This was definitely a difficult book to get through. Most of the stories are scattered and messy. Some are too minimalist and difficult to comprehend. This can work well for a play or movie, but less so for short fiction.So why 3 stars? Because Hempel's writing is unique and a few of the stories in this collection are well worth reading."
1,Save your money...I wish I had.,"I can't get into this book. I find it unreadable. I lost interest in it almost immediately. It's a hard to follow and boring. I love to read and find most things interesting, but this book is NOT one of them. Very disappointed as it came highly recommended, but so far I have not been able to complete it, which is very unusual for me."
1,Surely You Jest,"Hempel. What a piker. She is the Paul Haggis of the short story. Misdirection abounds. Only to hide the fact: nothing is there in the first place. And I was curious: I thought ""minimalists"" and all those Lish sycophants avoid the adverb? She pours 'em on like Mrs. Butterworth.Dig in eggheads."
4,Armchair Guide to Renaissance Architecture,"This well-illustrated, tightly-crafted paperback is a pleasure to read. By well-illustrated I don't mean fancy. You won't find big color photographs, but you will see what the author is talking about. Murray is not only an expert on the subject; he's a good writer, and I know of no other book that so effortlessly leads the reader through the story of how the wonderful Renaissance architecture of Venice, Rome, and particularly Florence came to be. If you want to know WHY those churches and palaces look that way, and why it matters, this is your book. I especially recommend it to Florence-bound travelers."
4,The turbulent 1960's,For anyone who lived during the 1960's or is interested on knowing thetroubled period for anyone living in the U.S. at this time this is a must see production. If you like the music of the Beatles you'll enjoy some of their tunes applied to different settings throughout the production.
5,Great Movie,"I've been a fan of the Beatles since birth so I was a little skeptical at how they were going to change the songs and do a musical. But it turned out way better than expected. Great song versions including ""I wanna hold your hand"" and ""While my guitar gently weeps"". Liked the story. Shot and directed beautifully."
5,I can't get enough of this movie!,"I saw the trailer and was intrigued by the layout so I gave the movie a shot and walked away wanting to turn around and watch it again. I went home and bought the Deluxe CD from iTunes and listen to it everyday! I can't wait for this to come out so I can watch it again and again! I love the way they matched the music up to the story line so well. The movie left me with a great feeling, which doesn't seem to happen much any more. I would say I fell in love with the movie and of course I would recommend this movie!"
5,Perfect,I absolutely love this movie and the music. I was happy that it came a lot earlier than expected. One happy customer here!
5,Across the Universe,Takes the Beatles music we grew up with it and puts it to life in a story related to that time.
5,Great movie,Across the Universe is a remarkable video interpretation of Beatle's music. I strongly recommend it to any Beatles lover or admirer. This special edition has a second DVD with excellent extra music and behind the scenes content.
1,Shut up already.,"I very much enjoyed the films Mulin Rouge and HairSpray, so I was open minded when going to see this one as well. I was seriously disapointed. I was bored throughout 95% of this movie. I thought the music was boring and also very annoying, as the movie dragged out to the point where I wished they would just shut up!!! Don't expect to see some lavish performance with spectuacular special effects; you just won't see it here. The plot, actors, and writing were all extremely boring to me. For me, a waste of time and money."
4,"Wonderful, Trippy, Dreamy, Ride, Creative","Oh! What a Lovely film. What a Fantastic production! Amazing sets... graphics, Songs! Oh! the Songs!!I would not really count myself as a Beatles fan per se. But I am a Convert when this cast sings the songs.Wonderful songs... very good acting, Fabulous Singing Oh! Fabulous! Costumes & Sets? Ridiculous. So good.A Pure Trip, without the drugs. Four and a half stars."
5,Great Beatles music Covers very artistic look at the 60's,"This cast of relatively unknown actors sings their way through the 60's and 70's, but it's more about the history of those times than it is about the Beatles. If you lived through the Beatles, Vietnam, Kent State, the race riots, this movie may explain the mileaux better, and more artistically, than anything currently available.Across the Universe came out the same month that my wife, son and I saw Love, the Cirque de Soleil show set to original Beatles songs re-mixed by legendary producer Sir George Martin and his son, Giles. That piece of live theater starts in post WW II bombed out London/Liverpool, with themes of British aristocracy being lost, the kids equally lost, and everybody looking for their future.While Love stays with British history, Across the Universe looks at both sides of the pond, as they say. I don't think you'll have any trouble following the history, and you'll love the music, some of it very serious, some very avante."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"I don't know how the critics got it so wrong when this movie came out. It was barely in the theaters long at all. Julie Taymor is such a genius & all the actors did a great job. I love the reinterpretation of the Beatles music. I don't usually buy movies, but I had to own this one."
2,very dissapointing,"I ama beatle fan and i`ve listen that this movie was full of song of the beatles, but when I saw it and listen how they destroy those beautiful songs I was very disapointed, the only song that sound nice was Being for the benefit of Mr kite,"
1,Pitch Shifter H*LL,There is a lot about this movie to like. The vignettes associated with the various songs worked well enough. Unfortunately there is blatant autotuning applied to much of the singing - like pop country music. Why are we not allowed to hear the actual singers' voices without this manipulation? It is very off-putting. Technology destroys art.
2,By By Birdie meets Forrest Gump,"My brother told me that I had to see this movie because I am a Beatles fan and that this movie was full of Beatle songs. Based soley on that I bought the DVD. My mistake....I should have read the cover closer. The songs are sung by American Idol wanna-be type actors. I just about turned it off when this Asian cheerleader is singing ""I Want To Hold Your Hand""...awful, just awful. But the story got a little better. But this is more than anything else, a ""musical"" and quite frankly, the musical performances are not very good. I made a mistake buying this. Should have rented the movie from iTunes for $3 in lieu of spending $20. Good idea on paper ...maybe, but having anyone else but the Beatles do Beatle songs is always gonna fall short."
5,WOW!!!,"I was so impressed with this movie! I am a huge Beatles fan, have been forever and this movie really delivers. It has a great way of using the great Beatles songs we know and love and putting them in the movie in a different way that still allows us to remember the original, but not feel cheated that it wasn't exactly how we first heard them. The characters names are great to remember the songs and so are some references. It is placed in the sixties and doesn't seem to really preach or take sides, but show what was going on at the time. I totally and highly recommend this movie!!!!"
5,across the Universe,"I really enjoyed this movie. I have been a fan of the Beatles since day 1. This movie was Happy, sad, Fun, The singers did a great job acting and the actors did a great job singing. It's a must see movie."
3,Across the Universe 3 Disc Limited Edition,"For the extra money I spent on the 3 disc set, I would have been just as happy (happier) with the two disk set. Unless you are totally into listening to a music director and dance choreographer technically discuss their art, it is not worth it. The original DVD and extra disk are amazing enough."
4,"Hit and miss, but the hits are worth it!","Hit and miss musical. It's a hell of a lot better than the last time they tried to make a musical out Beatles songs (Peter Frampton and the Beegees anyone?). The storyline is generic, sort of like a TV miniseries about the Sixties; no cliche left untouched. However, some strong performances and some inventive choreography saves the day. Not everything works, but luckily no act is longer than 3-4 minutes, so just wait for the next song to begin. My favorites included a radical reworking of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" (I hear it in a completely new light now), and the scenes with the Janis Joplin-like Sadie. Oh yeah, and there's the trippy scenes with Bono as Dr. Robert and Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite that are both pretty funny. As an added bonus, the soundtrack (when not recorded by the actors) was done by The Secret Machines!"
5,awesome movie,For those of us who lived through the sixties and seventies this is a great trip down memory lane. It made me incredibly nostalgic -- and then cured my nostalgia by reminding me what happened...
4,Across the Universe,This is one of my son's favorite movies. It was bought for his 19th birthday to help build his blue ray library.
5,Visually spectacular and a well-done Beatles tribute,I'm not familiar with Ms. Taymor's other films but I really enjoyed her Across the Universe--a unique take on a collection of popular Beatles' songs. The look of this film at times was intoxicating and I liked the various unique versions of the songs. Being a Beatles fan myself this is the first musical in that I was familiar with almost all the songs (the only other being the amazing Moulin Rouge--which at times I was reminded of while watching this.) Recommended.
1,Problems,The Subtitles doesnt work very well... especially in the songs. I am not conform with the product. I dont know if it is only particular to my product but i wasnt satisfy for the first time.
3,Beautiful,If you are a Beatles fan you will enjoy the way that their music was reinterpreted into visuals. This did not seem like a movie trying to make the Beatles fit in somehow. You could tell the writer loves the Beatles and wrote the story around the songs and the era. It was beautifully flimed and told a great story. There are some amazing artists and they sing beautifully. The story is simple but it is well made. I enjoyed this a lot.
4,It's Bright!,"This is probably the brightest flashlight I have seen that uses standard AA batteries. It is well constructed, but I wouldn't try to use it underwater. The choise of push-button on or constant on is a nice feature. The LED is liftime rated. This should be a cheaper light to maintain over the lithium powered flashlights that my office currently uses. I'm going to get a couple more for my employees."
5,terrific compact light,"Some people call it a drawback, but Inova has wisely chosen to make this a fixed-focus light. That's good because the focus ring is usually what fails first on a flashlight, so by omitting a feature of dubious value for most people, the manufacturer has doubled the product's reliability. They gave it a thumb switch, and that's it.Other than this consideration, there is little else to say that other reviewers haven't addressed already. This is a small, strongly-built, very bright light that will resist the elements and (probably) work when it is required to.**UPDATE: The warranty works, too! After almost five years of steady use, the tailcap switch started to flicker. I contacted Inova/Niteize, sent back the old light, and got a new one about a week later (7/31/12.)"
4,Best AA LED Light,"This is a terrific everyday carry flashlight. The Inova Bolt is sturdy, easy to grip, fits in any normal pants pocket, and the light is a steady 120 lumens. I've had this light for about a year now, and it's been a joy to own. Obviously, it's a bit more expensive than a similarly sized Mag-Lite, but I'd say the quality of body construction and candlepower output easily trumps the more familiar brand.I rate this as a four-star only because the flashlight is not waterproof (the button is obviously not sealed) and the mechanism for keeping the light on hands-free is a bit inconvenient. The button at the base will only keep the light on with constant pressure. Hands-free mode is accomplished by twisting the base which is tough to do one-handed.Besides those two drawbacks, I'd recommend the Bolt to anyone looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the $60 LED beasts on the market."
2,Nothing to brag about,"Inova BLT-2A Bolt 3.8 Watt LED FlashlightThe only good thing I can say about this flashlight is, it seems to be well built. Aside from that it doesn't even start to be as bright as any of my other 3 Watt flashlights. It seems like a candle compared to any of my other 3 Watt lights. Far too much money for what you get!"
3,Cannot use rechargeable AA's. So it's going back.,"Great light. Really, bright. BUT, it's going back. INOVA's official policy about the use of rechargeables is this stated in a email to me:""The use of rechargeable batteries is not recommended as the higher voltage would blow the bulb and could cause other electronic problems with the flashlight.""Come on INOVA. Great flashlights, but make one that uses common rechargeables."
1,Doesn't fit regular people?,"Neither my young adult daughter nor I could figure out how to fit this item on your head. No matter which side of your head, backwards or forward, the whole thing just dangled and swung around. The ear hook just wasn't strong enough to stay in position. I've already returned this item."
4,EDF Coming In!,"The number of AI bots, Weapons, Technology, Troopers, Destructible environments Ext. is astounding. A game that launches entire armies at you and you get to blast them away. Excellent feel and game play, a totally fun adventure."
2,Glitch tastic,"The good things about this game: tons of enemies, tons of unlock able guns. The bad there are a ton of glitches in this game. Most of the unlock able weapons are just the same weapon with tweaked stats. The graphics are terrible your ai teammates are useless. Over all should be cheaper. Only purchase if you're looking for a mindless shooter."
2,UMM am I missing something?,"Horrible graphics,horrible controls,ultra repetitive game play,I have no idea how this has a 4 star rating.If you are used to traditional FPS's stay far far away from this Jaguar reject and find something better."
5,music + video + multimedia app!,"Besides the 8 tracks on this cd, you also get a quicktime video of the song, ""Sleepy Sweet"", and a little delightful multimedia app which contains a discography, curious eye candy, ear candy, samples of their other songs & pictures of other album covers. I am the only Pram fan I know. I talked briefly with one of the women of Stereolab, and she said she thought they were brilliant. Hello? Hello? Other Pram fans out there?"
1,Family Time Could Be Better Spent,"My family and I did not enjoy the movie The Ghost Club. My children thought the acting on the part of the kids in the movie was not only poor, but very unconvincing. The children didn't seem natural and they seemed to act as though they felt what they were doing was silly. At times my younger son (9) would say, 'Now it's starting to get interesting' only to have it continue down the same boring trail. My daughter (11) enjoys scarey movies and books similar to the books by R. L. Stine; she was quite disappointed with this movie. I felt our time could have been better spent doing something else."
3,Cute and wholesome in a lame sort of way,"For a low budget movie, it really was quite good. We had a few good laughs over inconsistencies and inexperienced actors and the plot was predictable in a classic way. Wholesome family entertainment."
3,They were always crap.,"Well its not the seller's fault, these guys are always crap batteries where ever you get them. They hold a semi decent charge but take forever to recharge especially on a car charger."
2,Intriguing box set,"This is an intriguing box set. Annie Fischer presents some interesting views of Beethoven's sonatas but, sometimes, these views seem to be far away from the composer's style. The piano timbre is too harsh and, in some tracks, the Bösendorfer is out of tune! The sound quality is poor, the number of editing points is impressive and you can easily hear that classical analog editing noise; If the original session tapes were available, I think Hungaroton could release a digital editing master version; although this technology can provide some outstanding results, maybe it wouldn't solve the problems concerning tempo and balance. Annie Fischer's fans may enjoy these recordings; if you're not a fan, you better check Schnabel's or Arrau's boxes."
1,GILMORE GIRLS,I PAID FOR SEASON ONE BUT THE HOLD FIRST FOUR ESPISOLES ARE MISSINGS GILMORE GIRLS FIRST SEASON
2,"Long may ""Gilmore Girls"" continue!!","This warm and simple story, spiced up beautifully by a great cast of quirky characters and rapid-fire reparte makes for a very rare category of television viewing: intelligent but fun. What a welcome rest from the dreadful barrage of ""reality"" TV shows that we are continually subjected to!I hope this series continues till Rory and Lorelai are shuffling off to Luke's Diner on their walking sticks - in other words, for a long(...) time."
5,Perfection,"Season One of Gilmore Girls was absolutely perfection. Amy found the balance between quirky, witty, touching, sad, angry, you name it. The characters, unlike the recent seasons, were not cartoons, but actually believable. This season, by far, has the best episodes as well. Rory's Birthday Parties: utterly and completely perfect. The acting and writing were at its best in this episode. Nothing else compares to the scene when Lorelai recalls Rory's delivery, or when Emily sees Lorelai's room for the first time.Buy the DVD. There's no doubt about it. These episodes are worth the price and then some.But make sure you don't buy as many of the next season.We wouldn't want the WB to waste any of their precious money they now seem to lack so much of on those dreadful Season 3 episodes... or God forbid.. Season 4!"
5,Gushing over the Gilmores,"This is the only show that I have religiously watched on television for years now. It's not hard to explain why. This is some of the most superb writing on television.I love Lorelei. She'd be my friend. She's strong and smart. She makes pizza towers and watches really bad movies over and over again. She messes things up with men...a lot. She completely loves her kid. She keeps her sense of humor through it all. Is there a better fictional woman out there?And, don't even get me started on Luke, Suki, Rory...etc etc.If you loved Northern Exposure like I did, there is something familiar here. The town is small. The cast of characters is both eccentric and eclectic. You'll love them while you want to strangle them....just like family.If you haven't watched the show, start here. Start at the beginning. Watch things unfold, grow, change. It's worth your time."
5,Gilmore Girls-- Television Dialogue At It's Best,"The writing on this show is more than fantastic! Watching the first season on DVD was great because I could use the subtitles to read what they were saying-- sometimes the comebacks were so fast(especially by Lorelai) that it almost made my head spin! The acting is also teriffic-- Lorelai and Rory are a mother/daughter team made in rock-n-roll heaven and the supporting cast are each flavorful and delicious in their own way. After taking a complete weekend to view the entire 20 episodes plus pilot plus special features I found myself in a little funk and wishing that I actually lived in Stars Hallow and knew these people. Ah, if only life could be this witty, sassy and full of Gilmore ups and downs..."
3,no disc one,"I recieved the dvds in great time, BUT there were two disc 2s and no disc 1...so I was pretty disappointed. You can't really start off a series with ""previously on Gilmore Girls""."
3,product content is lots of fun,this product came damaged. the holders were broken so the disc flopped around inside the case but the disc played fine and the st ory is another afternoon enjoyment
3,Rear-view hindsight,"Easy install. Shipped quickly. Wiring connector mated perfectly with vehicle wiring harness. Fit and finish impressive, however, the mirror glass is not as securely mounted in housing, as original factory mirror. Mirror glass is more susceptible to road vibrations, causing rear-view image to be distorted on rough roads. Shaky rear-view might eventually cause me to seek GM brand part00-02 CHEVY CHEVROLET SUBURBAN MIRROR LH (DRIVER SIDE) SUV, Power, Heated, Manual Fold, w/Puddle Lamp, Grained Cover, w/o Dimmer (2000 00 2001 01 2002 02) CV19EL 15179836"
2,Not worth it,"The basic point seemed to be that if you pay attention and listen to your child all will go smoothly. This seems like a no brainer. Would you be buying the book if you weren't paying attention? The suggestions for discipline, although practical, were very basic. For example, have faith in your child, notice effort, listen for feelings, teach them to cooperate. Most parents already know these things."
3,It colud be written much better,"This book is Ok. However, it is silly to consider it as a creepy horror novell. This book is a composition of Dostoevskiy's ability to keep story events developing pretty slow, whlie filling the pages with a tremendous amount of text, and a few drops of 2nd freshness horror. I have read the whole book although sometimes it got really boring."
5,One of His Better Books,I could'nt put it down and have re-read it many times. His older work is definitey top notch. No more though in this readers mind.
2,Uneven,"""The Tommyknockers"" starts as many of King books do. Something unusual happens to a Maine resident, a blue-jeans everyman. Then, an apocalypse of events follows and we get what we like so much in his fiction: ordinary individuals facing problems which are usually too difficult for them to overcome. Snip: (...)"
4,An old favorite,"Tommyknockers isn't considered one of Stephen Kings best. It does have it's moments. I have read nearly all his books and this one fits in with the whole Stephen King world he has created. If you are observant, you'll catch a glimps of an old favorite clown in the book. And the childs rhyme of the Tommyknockers is clever too. I rate this book with 4 stars cause it's one of the books I'd like to sit down and read through again if i ever get the time."
5,A page-turner of the highest order,"I have heard many mixed reviews about this book. A lot ofpeople claim that it is not a good book to start with if you wish tointroduce yourself to King. Many others find the book too long. Others claim that it has nothing to say. First of all, this book was my introduction to King and now I am an avid reader, second, the pages flew by (I read it in six days), third, there was a reason for the 700+ pages. King uses the length of the novel to his advantage by giving all of the inabitants of Haven, Maine personality. By the end of the novel you know all of the characters personally (Ruth McCausland being my favorite). As far as scares go, it is true that this book won't cause the loss of much sleep (there are some good scares, to be sure, but it is not The Shining). This does not matter, however, because the wealth of plot twists, imaginative sequences, and character development make this book impossible to put down."
2,So many books...wasted too many hours on this one,"If you're looking for a book to hook you in, keep you turning the pages, emotionally connecting to the characters, read ""Harry Potter"". A friend suggested I start reading King with this book. Oy...what the hell was he on? It wasn't awful, just so disappointing. I appreciated the writing, but I wasn't enjoying this book on any level. It's in bad need of editing, but that's too late. Should have been half the length. Read something else."
3,i am not visually literate enough,honestly i found this book not easy to read. the idea of visual literacy is fancy and it takes some understandings. it is definitely not the entertaining kind. it doesn't have any narratives. plain theories. i guess it is better to read the book more than once to grasp the author's thesis and ideas.
4,"Big and plush, perfect for your lady!","I was gone from home on business for a while, and my wife LOVED this! It's actually pretty big, and super soft."
3,Coleman 58-Quart Ultimate Cooler (Ice Green).,"seemed to work ok, not quite as expecded, but fair, will not buy another one,did hold ice for 5 days but in mountains and not every warm"
2,A collection of 1993-94 essays without thematic unity.,"This is a collection of interesting, but largely unrelated, papers from a conference in Barcelona in 1994, which do not present a coherent analysis, and only marginally treat education in relationship to information technology. The title is misleading, and Castells is not the editor, but simply one of the contributors, writing on a topic alien to education. The reader from Atlanta writing a review on this site is absolutely right. Do not expect a book. Some of the articles, particularly the one by Freire, could be of your interest."
2,season of evil,"I have, over the years, managed to collect ALL of Elsie Lee's fiction books--with the exception of eighttitles..most ofher books I reread again and again. SEASON OF EVIL is the worst of all her books. The plot has too many points of coincidence and the ending is unbelievably contrived. The Amazon Service in getting this to me was, however, excellent,"
5,perfect!,"i got this for my car, because the way my seats are makes it hard for me to sit up straight and long slouchy car rides hurt my back. i adore this pillow, i occasionally use it for a neck roll and it is wonderful to take on plane trips as well."
5,Well designed,"Very good, much better than I expected. The pillow is well made and the stuffing works very well. Also easy to take on a trip."
3,bucky pillow,"I am enjoying the pillow a great deal. However, the company (after 3 phone calls) and an email never answered me as to why the velour cover seemed to be in a worn state. That is very disappointing, so if I would rate the company, I would never order from them again because of bad customer service. Rating the pillow if it were new and in good condition, it would be fine for great neck support."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"My only real problem with this pillow is that it doesn't have straps to go around the back of the chair. This is my own fault, as I knew this before I ordered it, but didn't realize it would be such a problem. It's quite annoying to have to readjust it every time I get up and down, and since I am using it at work, I do get up and down quite often. If it had the straps, I'd be much happier with it."
2,"Good Idea, but.....","This was a good idea, to have several writers get together and work on a common theme. It has been done before and most of the ideas came off quite well. This particular book did not quite make the grade.The basic story is a good one. A piece of the true cross with a curse attached to it as it from hand-to-hand during different periods. A short story from each of the authors covers each period. Unfortunately, some of the authors were not that good and the story as a whole suffered because of that."
4,foldable table,It's just the item I was looking for. I used the table for art shows to display my wares.
1,Baffled by High Ratings,"When I buy something inexpensive, I don't expect high quality, but I expect a useable product. Not only did this come with a hole in the table (which isn't difficult to do since it's cheap particle board)but it doesn't hold up well for anything of any weight. I suppose if you are lucky enough to get one that isn't damaged and you plan to use it for lightweight table settings, playing games, or some other light use it may be fine; once mine is done with it's temporary purpose it will be used for trash. Amazon will make it right so know this reivew is strictly my opinion of the product."
5,Great book,Tis will be the second time our home group has gone thought this series and we are looking forward to it. As leaders in the home group my wife and i will be going through this the third time and every tim we do our marriage get better and better.
4,Good stuff!,I got the CD and listened in my car and the whole show from start to finish was hysterical! A definate must have for any roadtrip!
3,OK,"Im sure these seal very well, but they are made of such thick, hard plastic that they are somewhat difficult & awkward to use."
3,really more like 2.5 stars,"What can i say about Fuzzdolly. They have a great bassist, and a good band to go with it. The vocals are not the most impressive but acceptable. It's a rock album, and it's a fairly good one.What i did like about this album was that there was no over-dubbing (or so it says on the package) If that is true, i am impressed. It's like a live show...with mastering. Commendable."
2,Beware!,"I can't speak about the actual product itself but I would like to warn buyers about the sellers of this product. I purchased this Checklist twice and both times the order was cancelled. To quote the seller, ""For whatever reason, the selling of this book through amazon.com has been the cause of much confusion because supposedly there are two of these books with the same exact title, yet they're different"". The second time I purchased the item Amazon informed me that the seller no longer had the product in stock. Beware buyers and make sure you investigate the seller."
1,If you dissent from the Catholic Church teaching...,"Then you will like this book. If you follow the Church's teaching, live by it, love it and follow it, prepare to be terribly insulted. You will be called a ""robotic Catholic"" and one who is not ""tolerant"" of dissenting teaching. It is a Protestant book shrouded by Catholic terminology, but not Catholic understanding. The author misses a perfect opportunity to viably discuss Catholic theology. Instead, we are posed with immoral choices compared to even more immoral choices without true understanding of why or how they are immoral. The author has no concept of a true moral dilemma. Church teaching is presented as only one of many ""opinions"" equal, and even inferior to any number of other ""individuals"" opinions. Those looking for a moral compass should look for a more definitive teaching. I would suggest the Catechism of the Catholic Church for beginners."
1,This is a REALLY BAD TOY!,"I got this for my daughter for Xmas today. I bought her tons of Bratz stuff and this was the only disappointment. It is packaged up and ready to go back to the store tomorrow. It is really a dumb piece of plastic. All you can do with it is put the doll inside. To 'record' your song you use the microphone (that takes 3 oddball watch type batteries) and it only records TEN SECONDS. You can't save your song or anything, it just records over. The sound is not great and is fuzzy. I read the box and did not see anything about the 10 seconds on it. I thought my daughter would be able to record herself singing a whole song and be able to play it back. Nope! She can record 10 secs, listen to a fuzzy playback, and then record over it. Not worth the money at all! We got the tourbus and the airple and those are great, spend your money on those! Skip this one!"
1,Not the greatest,"The only thing that my daughter really liked was the microphone. The rest of it just sits there. It doesn't really do anything and I would not recommend this to anyone else. If I had to do it again, I would have just bought her a sing-a-long microphone."
5,Reviewing Patriotism,"This is a thoughtful book that covers many political and emotional issues that effect us all. The beginning and end are political in nature and the middle concerns itself with our moral values and judgements. This is a Must Read for all American's claiming to want peace in this world. She insists that the change starts at home and in our local community. This book is for anyone who feels they are an American patriot and asks us to review that commitment and live up to a new challenge, that actions speak louder than words."
3,Somewhat lackluster for such a brilliant author,"I was eager to read _Small Wonder_ after immensely enjoying Kingsolver's previous book of essays, _High Tide in Tucson_, as well as just about everything else she's written. I was disappointed to find it much less engaging. Kingsolver generally uses a very deft approach to moral ambiguities, presenting the reader with the issues and then for the most part leaving us to draw our own conclusions. In this book, however, I felt I was being beaten over the head with her ideology. Never mind that I agree with her on most points; I still didn't appreciate having her opinions stuffed down my throat. It may be that our country's current dismal outlook on the political and environmental scenes are causing her to become more angry and shrill. If so, this seems like a better way to turn readers off than on. If she weren't one of my favorite writers, I would probably have given this 2 stars rather than 3."
2,Small Wonders,"I am a liberal and proud of it. I do not hesitate to vocally oppose the occupation in Iraq and the stupid turns our foreign policy has recently taken. I generally agree with all the views expressed in Kingsolver's book. BUT, I still didn't like it. It is offensive when a skilled artist like Kingsolver uses her ""publishability"" as an opportunity to stand on a soap box. Just write and reflect on the things you know. There are many experts who dedicate their lives to other issues; world politics, economics, the environment, etc. When we want to learn about those issues, those are the books to read. Kingsolver is a fantastic novelist and personal essayist, this does not make her a social/political/environmental expert."
1,This Set Did Not Contain 5 Discs with 10 Movies,"I purchased this set and found that this set did not contain 5 discs with 10 movies, it only had 4 discs with the first 8 movies.It did not contain ""The Kettles in the Ozarks / The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm"" and therefore not the complete set as indicated.The outside box is mislabled by saying it contains 5 discs and 10 movies. The fact is that it is only 4 discs and 8 movies.Anyone else experience this?"
3,Nice looks but watchband is rediculous,"The watchband is a unique cut and for very small wrists ONLY. Movado has no other band length available for some strange reason. I tried jewelers, movado sanctioned, and was told to see a leather crafter and maybe he could help me..... High end product... I think not!"
5,"Mangos, like Magic, dripping off the page","Read this book if you need to re-center, rethink, or relax. Like Joshua Kadison's music, his novel uses realistically magical images to stir the reader/listener's soul. A ""must"" for anyone needing a deceivingly simple, yet charmingly welcome escape to his island. . . ."
3,Beware - NOT the dress that is in the picture!,"I ordered this dress TWICE thinking I had somehow misordered it the first time. The same wrong dress came both times! It is not the same dress that is in the picture, but a different dress entirely!"
1,it is not saffron,it has big thread and without smell.i don't believe this is a real saffron. STOP buying this fake saffron.
2,C.W. Trivia?,"This is a small book containing 329 facts about the Civil War. The reason that I rate it so low is that when I think of a trivia book, I think of questions and answers, which this book is not."
4,It might just change your mind...,"I've never paid much attention to Oprah's television show, but this book helped persuade me to watch it now and then. The author shows that even though Oprah doesn't use a lot of religious jargon or overtly Christian messages, she continually preaches a social justice gospel: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In an age of celebrity excess--a trap that Oprah does occasionally fall into--here is one celebrity putting her money where her mouth is to do some good. A lively, readable book, for fans and doubters alike."
3,"Light weight, but be careful.","Not the sturdiest thing ever. Won't hold a lot of weight all at once. And food, like hot dogs, can slip through the bigger spaces. If you can't find a better alternative and need it for backpacking buy it. I did. Just be careful."
5,Absolutly Delightful!,"This set of books set in Mitford are such a pleasure to read. Part way through you begin to feel like you, too, are a citizen of this wonderful town. Jan Karon sure can write! I would reccomend them highly."
1,NOT the bibliography,"This is not the bibliography -- it is an article recommending it. It is a waste of money, and should not be for sale. I feel ripped off by Amazon."
3,"Interesting, but lacking","I think Cahill forgot what he titled the book. Very little of this book is actuallly about the gifts that the Jews gave us. He spends most of the book retelling stories that have already been told. I would have liked to read more about how the Jewish worldview actually brought about some of the movements he mentions in Chapter 7 - such as Abolition, Apartheid, etc. He tends to state ideas as if they are facts. I would like some evidence or at least for him to explain why he thinks this way."
2,"Entertaining, but Largely Fluff","This book was an entertaining summary of Judaism from Abraham to Babylon, but intellectually it was mostly fluff. I found myself reading on and on through the summaries of the scriptures to get to his new insights and theses, but nothing really substantial developed. A bit disappointing, but I did enjoy the topic."
4,Interesting history of the Jewish people,"I bought this book after reading Cahill's Desire of the Everlasting Hills. This was good, but not nearly as good a book as that one. Still highly recommend it for all who'd like a view of ancient religion and the significance of the unique Jewish encounter with God."
5,Excellemt Glimpse Into Our Common History,"This book should be required reading in that it shows that through our common history, we have more in common with each other, than we have differences."
3,"The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels (Hinges of History, Vol. 2)",Boring book but it did arrive in good condition as described. But a very boring read. Thanks
1,crap,it hurt my nose when i wore it. instead of having the opening for the nose it goes down and digs into it. leaving an unattractive mark.
3,A decent introductory book,"The good thing about this book is the appendix which helps beginners along, and the clear organization.The bad things however are:(1) the imbalance between materials on symmetric-key and asymmetric-key cryptosystems;(2) the omission of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem."
5,Definition Review,"This has to be one of the most well put together Compilations I have heard this year.. right from the get go with DJ A-Beats intro all the way thru to the Neblina Outro {produced by Neblina's own TM22} it feels organic, the people who put together this CD really picked the best of the bunch when it came to song selection as it doesn't feel like a compilation when you are listening...This is A Definate Must for fans of Hip Hop Music"
5,what a voice!,"Rick Price arrived on the scene fairly late in his career as a thirty year old with ""Heaven Knows"" a collection of great up beat pop tunes showcasing his extraordinary voice. Another Place continues in that vain with price delivering great upbeat tunes like ""Where in the world"" and ""Love and Maddness"". And then there is my personal favourite the atmospheric superb rendition of the Richard Page penned tune ""Ghost of you and me"" you wont get a better vocal performance of this song then the one Price shares with us here. If you want to see what Price is really capable of you'd best come downunder to Australia and catch him live, otherwise go out and buy a copy of his superb second album ""Tambourine Mountain""."
2,Come on Kenny!,"Concert is good but I want a LIVE concert, not live different songs from different concerts! Would prefer to hear a live concert from one arena!"
2,Why does it take so long,Why does it take so long for items that are shipping from Amazon. When Items I ordered that ship from other merchants ship in a day or 2. Items that ship directly from Amazon can take up to 3 weeks or more to even be shipped out.
4,"Good TV, Great Price","This TV is good looking and delivers a steller HD picture when hooked up to an HD tuner. I don't have many complaints with this TV, but the one that bugs me most is that it doesn't have a zoom mode for letterboxed 4:3 images. This means that you can't just zoom in on the center of the screen, which leaves images distorted. Not a problem if you have a decent DVD player (I don't), but an annoyance nonetheless. Highly recommended."
3,Life with Olevia,"When I got mine, it came DOA... the main board was bad, technical sent me an advanced ship tv meaning I got a replacement, and then shipped my broken unit to them. Time was about a week each way...Support is a 8 out of 10 answer the phone immediately, offer solutions BUT for advanced replacement, they require a lot of documentation, i.e., receipt, sign a contract, and a credit card.TV ... it has a good picture on HD box, generates a good bit of heat would be a negative but even more negative is the bright bright blue LED while in standby mode. At night, if in a bedroom, it illuminates the entire room to the degree some people find it too much. Personally, I find it annoying...Inputs are decent, compares to others in the price range... remote is a bit quirky to do settings, especially compared to my Mitsubishi DLP which has a vast array of easy to use settings."
2,Not as good as I expected,"This LCD TV was to be used in the Master Bedroom but after hooking up the set found it to be less than expected. I returned the set via UPS last week for a refund. I will now make purchase with a local vendor. My complaints are as follows:- horizontal white lines about 4"" apart scroll constantly across the screen- unit is very noisy with the volume turned off- didn't like the remote control layout, volume control and channel control too small and not in a good location- picture and colors changed from channel to channel, constantly had to adjust settings to get a good picture- overall picture quality wasn't as good as my regular tube type TV set"
3,Backlight issue?,"I bought this tv a couple months ago. The picture quality is so-so, but the price (much less than what's listed here) was great. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's very difficult to get hold of customer service/tech support. I was noticing a very large amount of light leak at the corners, and called them up. They had UPS pick up my tv and it was returned to me quickly. Unfortunately, the leakage wasn't fixed. The light leak I'm talking about is bright white in the corners with the white diffusing over at least an inch square in each corner. This is noticeable when viewing a dvd that has a wider aspect ratio, thus giving the black bars on top and bottom. Is anyone else seeing this problem? I called them up again, and tech support insisted this was normal. I work in high tech myself, and never have I seen an LCD with this much leakage. If you're seeing this as well, please post it so I know it actually is normal with this tv. Thanks."
3,Good quality/cost,"Good picture, average features but the remote control is one of the worst I've ever used."
4,My First LCD HD-Ready,"First, the box had handles and was easy to carry (minor to some, but if you've been moving furniture for a week, it's important). Second, stand was already attached, so I just lifted it out and plugged it in. Third, the connections are all easy to find and use. Fourth, (now remember I've never had anything but off brand CRT's) the picture was AMAZING!!!! Fifth, I can't wait to hook up my iBook and start really building my website. Finally, the price is the clincher. $750 for this level of quality. Never heard of Olevia until I went investigating LCD TV's. Now I'm looking to see what other products they make."
3,Nice wrench,American made wrench which is important to me. The thing that I didn't like about it was that it did not read zero even from the factory. Am trying to get it replaced an will update review later as to how the new one is.
3,Adequate,"This torque wrench is adequate for work that does not require much precision. Since this is a flex beam type torque wrench, there is no provision for ""zeroing"" out the tool before use, like a dial indicator type. The indicator on this wrench was not set, or resting, on zero when it arrived. There is no way to correct for this other than bending the indiator. Consequently, it leaves the user to guess at the degree of accuracy or inaccuracy of the tool."
3,Huge dip in song writing quality,"I would say Minor earth is the best album of this decade by anyone, but this is mostly uninspired. It's got one instant classic, the title song. Forever not yours is also a song I like to listen to each time, along with Dragonfly. But beyond that, there's nothing that is truly special. Some of the songs here like Afternoon high, Oranges, There's a reason, Did anyone approach you, sound like they were searching for ideas to strike them, but never hit upon anything good. a-ha normally have a beautifully ""depressed"" quality to their music but here it is ""bored."""
4,"Doggytime, hampsers?","And ""everything, including you, disgusts me""? I'm buying this CD for the titles alone."
5,A timeless book,"Tracks has been on my bookshelf for twenty years. It's not just a journey from the middle of Australia, but a woman's journey into herself. In the middle, gorgeous black-and-white pictures by the photographer who's also a character in the story. This was Robyn Davidson's first book, in her late twenties, and I wish she had kept writing in that voice (the other books by her that I read were not at that level). But who can blame her for going beyond the person she was at thirty? Thank you Robyn for that timeless piece."
2,Out of stock?,"Ordered the Guess Who, got U-2. Got a return postage form and sent it back. I got my money refunded but never an explanation from the seller. All I wanted was my original purchase. Not again.."
5,Annoyances fixed,This book makes it easy to fix Access. Simply look in the table of contents for the annoyance that is plaguing your database and go to the page that fixes it. Most of the fixes are simple ones that are either hidden from the user or just not documented well in the Access help. Just one of the fixes was worth the price of the book. The rest were bonuses. My database now works the way I had envisioned it would.
2,The Real Reason It Sucks,"Listen people, I know if you're looking for an adventure game, you've come to the wrong place. It is an arcade game. But I couldn't care less. If I want to put The Thing against Daredevil, I don't care if it is and arcade like style. But that's not why it sucks. This is why: Story Mode. It's a lot more frustrating than it should be, and every few seconds if you're not careful, you blow up. And the main villian isn't directly fought by a Marvel hero! And then, the some of the heroes are brainwashed into attacking each other, and the game doesn't tell you if they're put back to normal. And if that wasn't enough, 3 heroes have undetermined deaths in the cutscenes. This game is all over the place, and it's confusing enough that I don't even know who won. If you're a Marvel fan, I need to stop you from buying a true mistake."
5,Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects,This game has the graphics and your patience to beat the game. I enjoy playing this game.
1,Another one of those brand name cash ins!,"What the hell was my brother thinking? Crappy story line, finished in 20 mins and graphics that would make psone look on in disgust!"
5,Dog loves this bed,"My 11 year old German Shepherd suffers from multiple issues. He has hip dysplasia, spondolosys and Dylinating Mylenoma. He is having a hard time with his back legs and he was always getting them caught in his previous bed (which was just too bulky and soft). I got this bed hoping it would lay flatter and would offer him a lot of joint support. I have this bed on top of another mat with support foam in it. IT WORKS GREAT. He loves this bed so much more. He's not tripping in it and not getting his feet caught. It supports him very well and he gets in and out of his crate with ease. thank you so much!!!"
5,A Year in the Life of an ESL Student,"This book is an excellent tool to learn how to speak English like an American.The chapters and the exercises are second to none. I enjoy studying this book, because it uses a different method to teach English as a second language.I made a great purchase.Benny Fernandez"
1,Memory that doesnt remember,I bought these memory cards new and they do not function well. I have lost data and the console had trouble reading them the entire time. I'll pay more and get quality next time.
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"This is one of the best westerns I've read.I go back to read it again & again becaue like all good books, it is a wonderful world to return to."
2,Boring,"This game is pure chance, and so simple a preschooler could play. The pigs are cute, and we had high hopes, but played for about 5 minutes, and haven't gotten it out again. It will be in our next garage sale."
5,Suspense Thriller,"As a teenager, this was one of my favorite television movies. It has some similarities to the movie, ""Carrie"". It is about two sister who go away to college. They promise to stay together, but are soon separated as they both join different sororities. Patti, the outgoing sister, is asked to join the most popular sorority. Her sister, Sarah, joins the most unpopular sorority. Sarah is taunted by her sister's new sorority friends. Little do they know that Sarah has psyho-kinetic powers. Sarah's sorority house mother practices and teaches witchcraft. She senses Sarah's special powers and decides to try and help her become stronger. Everything leads up to a shocking climax on Initiation Day. The cast is very familiar. Kay Lenz does a good job playing the part of Sarah. Morgan Fairchild plays the part of Patti's snobby sorority sister. Shelly Winters is the crazy house mother. Morgan Brittany plays the part of Patti."
4,Does the job!,"The only thing that would make this product better would be if the indicator lights told you how much the batteries were charged so you knew how much longer until they were ready. Besides that, its a great product."
1,Aren't any better than cheaper models,"I bought these for my Canon Powershot because I was tired of the rechargeable batteries I had not lasting that long. Some reviews talked about how long these batteries lasted. DON'T BELIEVE THEM!! I wasted $40 buying these batteries, and they don't last any longer than the generic set I bought for half that price."
5,Superb film.,This film grasps you from the beginning to the very end. I especially loved the various angles and techniques used by the director. Very bold storyline. Worth seeing.
3,Consumption,"Connected to Madsen's previous book ""Confessions of a Flesh-eater"", ""Orlando Crispe's Flesh-eater's Cookbook"" is a hodgepodge of recipes, culinary activities, memories, and dining experiences. Crispe is a famous chef, whose culinary art has intriguing effects on those who consume it. Using all sorts of meats in his dishes (including human flesh and juices), Crispe documents and reminisces about his friends and acquaintances. It's all rather fascinating, but not having read ""Confessions"", I was quite lost, like it was all a private joke I was missing out on. Nonetheless, this is an interesting addition to such cannibalistic fiction as Virgilio Piñera's ""René's Flesh"", Slavenka Drakulic's ""The Taste of a Man"", and Poppy Brite's ""Exquisite Corpse""."
4,Rigorous,"A very detailed introduction to Calculus. Not for the faint of heart. It is extrememly thorough and sometimes a little dense, but in the end conveys the concepts completely."
2,Only for Breeders,"The only reason to get this book is if you are a collie breeder or truly interested in becoming one. Otherwise, this book is completely useless. The average dog owner does not care about what dog won a stupid dog show in 1954... this book has a ton of useless facts like that."
2,Poor quality toy violin,"My girl wanted a toy violin. This fit the bill just ""okay"". After just a few times of play, the Cinderella's poorly constructed arm literally fell off. The rest of the function is okay. You can't really ""play"" the violin, they just pretend to play while music plays from pushing different buttons. They still play with it, though."
1,Not a winner,"My daughter(then 5) really wanted a violin for Christmas. We already had the FirstAct accordian which she loved. This, however, she did not. I can't even make music using the stick. The heart on the front is a button you push down to make the music ""beat of a prerecorded song"" It is impossible to make the song sound good even when using your hand. The stick is practically useless (except as as weapon.) The kids usually just had it play on its own. Everyone got sick of the three recorded songs very quickly. The little princess on the front moves along with the music (for the first day) She then fell off and broke. The kids played with it for a few days, but it has been over a year and no one has asked to play with it...even when I take it out and display it. A Big Waste of Money!"
2,Bleh,"Okies...you like utena eh? You wanna see what utena is about? Well...don't watch this, i saw it thinking, YAY! A MOVIE! likea continuation or a summ up of it all...well they did some pretty weird and stupid things in this movie...don't watch it...i gave it 2 stars because the pics are cool, but really, a car wash? C'mon y'didn't need that..."
3,Interesting,"Quite interestin effort to merge Eastern vocal flavour with avanguard.It has very nice moments,but what I missed mostly is Fred's guitar,which is presented very little.Nevertheless ,a good CD."
2,Not pleased - very cheap looking,I was so disappointed when I opened my box. It can only sit on a table top and looks real crappy.
4,"Good board, not what I was looking for",I was looking for a dartboard with a smaller double and triple ring so that we could practice our triples and doubles. I always thought it was called a championship board. Anyway for a regular dartboard it works great. I only gave it a 4 star because it was not what I needed.
1,"Good god, what is this MESS supposed to be?","Seriously, there's not a single reason to purchase this CD when you can get the original Soundtrack by Howard Shore.First of all, the tracks on this album are not in film order. Ok, that's not really bad, but that many parts repeat themselves within a single track, is.All pieces sound terribly synthetic, are too silently mixed and lack the impressive Elvish vocals featured in the OST.After all this, the lack of five tracks from the OST doesn't really matter."
3,neat stuff,"one of the other reviews said that the 60's nirvana were the ones that wrote the song ""Lithium"", to clear things up they didn't... it is actually a cover of the 90's nirvana song from the album nevermind."
1,Where are the CDs?!,"What Amazon and the other reviewers fail to explain is that you must have the CDs or cassette tapes to properly use ""Japanese for Young People, I"" -- and that Amazon does NOT include them with your purchase or the book. Indeed, you cannot even buy the audio recordings separately (Amazon lists them as ""unavailable"").Page after page of ""Japanese for Young People"" has exercises based on the recordings, which makes much of the book pretty useless. Wish we had known that before we ordered the book, as it would have saved us the trouble of shipping it back and asking for a refund."
2,"Helpful for beginners, but there's better..","I'm currently using this book in my first year Japanese class in college. It is rather helpful, but comparing this book to Genki Vol. 1, Genki is much better. Genki does a much better way of explaining the particles, vocabulary, sentence structue, etc.If you're learning on your own, or learning in school, and are using this book I suggest you pick up Genki too. It'll be worth it in the end if you want to further your knowledge of the language."
4,I'd Buy it Again,"Just trying to get back into darts after a long haitus. I was searching for an attractive dartboard cabinet for our rec room. This one does exactly what I want...it's a good quality dartboard in an good looking, well-made cabinet all for a very decent price. I had it within a week of ordering and it came in great condition. I would buy it again without hesitation."
1,Broken,"Sorry to do this as a review, but I can't seem to find a way to contact the seller directly and the refund/exchange options are not appropriate for the problem I have. The cabinet arrived badly broken- everything else is fine. Ideally, I'd just like a replacement cabinet. If none are available I'd like a partial refund. The only option on the website is full refund."
3,Scratches/ Broken hindge,My package arrived in an timely manner but since it was a gift I just wrapped it up and did not bother to check it to make sure everything was OK (big mistake).A few days later when the person I gave it to opened it to my surprise and embarassement the hindge on the cabinet door was completely unscrewed making the cabinet look defective in addition a few scratches on the cabinet door and inside. We were able to place the screw but does not tighten properly.
1,Did I Get Some Little Kid's First Woodworking Project?,"I realize that this is not a top-of-the-line item, but is it too much to ask that all of the holes attaching the doors and hinges not be stripped? It takes awhile to find all of those tiny screws when they're rolling around the box. Also, could just one of the pre-drilled holes be positioned correctly? Just one, please?As may be read in some of the other reviews, the darts are laughable. If the buyer is willing to do a little bit of repair work while putting it together; doing the work that a manufacturer generally does with even the most economical of merchandise, and the cabinet is not going to be the focal point of your rumpus room, knock yourself out."
5,Exceptional Book For Young Children,"This is a Trisha Howell classic. Like all of her books, it presents life in its whimsical and glowing aspects. I have enjoyed reading it to several children."
3,Good so far!,"I am in the middle of reading ""The Headless Cupid"". So far I have found this book to be somewhat interesting. I have yet to finish the book so I can not say for sure if this book is good or bad. I can only say that I have liked the first half. So far it has introduced the characters. David seems to be the main character and also my favorite. Blair, the youngest boy in the Stanley family and my second favorite because he seems to have natural supernatural powers. I really don't think I like Amanda, David's new stepsister. So far she has been unpredictable. One minute she talks to David like a sister and the next she ignores him. Molly, David's new step mom is nice. I am a little confused about David's real mom, who died. He says that she was into the super natural just as Amanda is. The new Stanley family seems to be a weird combination. And it looks as though it is going to get much weirder."
1,Not for Children!!,"I found this book disturbing. It teaches witchcraft and the occult, not just a paragraph or two but it is the main theme of the book. I don't think our children or anyone else for that matter will benefit from the learning of evil that's here. Our children don't need encouragement in dabbling in things not good for their soul. Julie"
3,missed it,"The only good scene was the rape scene in the trailer, and that was light. There a a lot of scenes where they missed it. The bad guy was good."
2,No Real Point,"The book is written in a question & answer format. There is not a good index to find the anecdotes that might be of interest. The overall message seemed to be that no matter what you do with a gifted child, he or she will turn out all right. Interspersed are some poorly-drawn cartoons. It would have been useful to have suggestions for how parents and teachers can help gifted children learn more.On the plus side, there are some good lists of books for the children and additional resources for the parents."
5,XMEN : FALL OF THE MUTANTS,This has always ben a favorite storyline for me. This is from an era of great X-MEN stories. The X-MEN at their best doing what they do best.
2,Meh.,"This collection is highly unmemorable. The X-Men story is one of those stories that makes you wonder if Claremont really is the God we all believe him to be. The dialogue is uninspired, the characters don't mesh and the villain is unmemorable.The X-Factor tale is the unveiling of Archangel, which is historic... but poorly executed. Appocolypse seems not like a dangerous villain, but a comical jack-in-the-box toy.The New Mutants story is a joke.I gave this collection two stars only because of the signifigance of the Archangel story."
4,Simple and Convenient,"I use these C-Line clear plastic report covers as binders for appraisal reports.Having a removable spine allows my clients to easily separate the pages for copying.They work very well, but have several limitations. It is difficult to open the spines to allow them to slip over the back of the report cover. You are also limited as to the number of pages that can be bound in a single cover. From my experience about 20 pages is the limit. Still, for the price, they do the job. 12.2012."
5,Great product and great pice,Always a great product. Great way to look professional with reports to clients. Heavy enough plastic to not bend or kink and look bad.
2,"NOT ""clear""","I bought these so that my fourth grade class would not incur extra expenses in preparing their ""CA Mission"" reports (I teach in a poor area). While these serve the purpose, they are a pale lavender, not clear. I was disappointed."
3,not that great,This was an roll up pouch but the material used is rather stiff and it doesn't roll up very nicely.
5,took pouch,This was a gift for my son and he loved it. It was exactly what he wanted and what he thought it would be. The description was great.
4,So far not as good as the first,"I started out thinking that this second installment was ""so far not as good as the first."" I found the artwork especially disconcerting--and have yet to check out if the same artist was used--though I enjoyed Miller's usual mix of humor, shock, horror and terror. Some of the storylines were surprising...Superman & Wonder Woman did what???! Altogether, enjoyable if not as classic as the first. Batman as the rebel with a cause is always a powerful hero to cheer for even if he does most of his work, well into his 60s, behind the scenes. The contrast drawn between a hero without superpowers (Batman) turning the world right side up again while heroes with superpowers have sold out (especially Superman) or been driven underground is awesome. Like always, Miller's Batman is not for children but was Batman, with his darkness, ever really for children?"
2,Disappointed,"You know, I had very hgh expectations, having thoroughly enjoyed the first book. This book was weird, and very different from The Dark Knight Returns. I wasn't expecting a carbon copy of the same thing, but this was just out there. I wouldn't ever strongly recommend this to anyone. It did have some value, and I don't feel like my time was completely wasted, but if I had to do it over again, I woul probably bought a different book."
2,Disappointing..,"I, like many other readers, was excited at the prospect of Frank Miller taking on the Dark Knight again, in a sequel no less, to the series that redefined the character in the first place. What fans got was a muddled, often inconsequential story that takes place some years after the original. Batman's still underground, and thought to be dead. Superman is still a lackey for the government. Not much has changed since Dark Knight Returns. Miller wastes the role of the ex-mutant gang that Batman trains: apear only shortly over the course of the series. Batman beats up Superman with the kroptonite gloves again. Big deal. Considering the space between issues (it took well over six months for this three-issue series to come out), and the overall inconsequentiality as a follow-up, I give it two stars only for the awesome coloring of Lynn Varley (even the art looks rushed)."
5,Batman gives the world a kick in the pants,"Wow... a lot of people really hated this comic. I don't see why. Granted, the big revelation at the end is kind of weak... but the story is awesomely entertaining nonetheless. Not as good as its predecessor by any means, but a worthy follow-up to it. Character development kind of takes a back burner (for everyone but, strangely enough, Superman), but it's replaced by good old over the top comic book action in an awesome stick it to the man storyline... what's not to love?"
1,Disappointing would be an understatement,"The Dark Knight Returns was great. Truly great.This was, well, crap. The story makes no sense and the art is frankly (hah a pun) childish. The eventual villain totally ignores years of DC continuity and character development. Superman and Wonder Woman are caricatures of themselves.While reading it, I couldn't help but think that Miller was intentionally punking everyone who read and loved the original. that story actually had respect for the characters it portrayed. This just made fun of them for no logical reason."
1,"Makes Clooney's ""Batman and Robin"" Look Good By Comparison","Just about everyone else who gave it one star has already put it better than I ever could. This was the single most disappointing Batman story I have ever had to suffer through. And a warning for those seeking All-Star Batman and Robin out... the art may be tons better than what you find here, but Miller's writing is still just as bad."
3,Big Disappointment After Dark Knight Returns,"I'm sure everyone else was eagerly anticipating this sequel just as much as I was. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the standards of The Dark Knight Returns. The artwork that seemed quirky and stylish in the first series seemed rough and sloppy here. The hero references that were mysterious before, here seemed forced and clumsy. The old adage says to always leaving the audience wanting more. Here, Miller and company didn't leave us wanting more, they gave it to us. Much like seeing Darth Vader's face in Return of the Jedi, getting what we wanted was infinitely disappointing."
3,disappointing,I had pretty high hopes even after the mixed reviews but mixed is about right. There are some good things here but it is all in the first half of the book. I wonder if Miller got mad at DC half way through and just tanked it on purpose.
1,ouch.,"You would have never guessed that Frank Miller would have been a great writer if not for his previous works. This graphic novel lacks depth, lacks a good plot, lacks good artwork, and lacks spirit. In comparison to his other works, this is a piece of crap. Dont waste your time reading this."
2,Not as Good as previous,"Comparied to Frank Millers Previous Batman Novel it really isn't that good. Not saying that it's awful, it's still worth a read! though I was really looking forward to reading this but did feel let down by it."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still a good story!","More of a story of superman as a puppet, than that of the dark knight. Still a good story,I wish it was more bat man though..."
2,Not this time ...,"(Rating 2.5 out of 5)You know, the sad part about this is that if I had never read anything by Frank Marshall I would probably have enjoyed this quite a bit.As it was, it was just a nice adventure.What made ""Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Year One"" so enjoyable for me was the deep, inner monologue of the main characters. Yes, sometimes it would go on for pages but at the end I was right along side the character emotionally.In ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"" the story (and me along with it) was jumping around so much between the plethora of plot points and characters I never got the sense the story really knew where it was going nor what the characters were feeling.Afterwards, I felt as if the whole story could have been split into 3, each building on the other.Alas, my high hopes were not met."
5,Wonderful inventive music,"This is one of my favorite recordings of modern clarinet music. Although the music comes from a relatively well defined era of British music, the styles are quite varied. Frankel and Machonchy write music in a modern, spiky idiom, where Cooke and Howells are of a more traditional school of composition. This recording is a reminder that sometimes good music doesn't come from the established masters, but from relatively minor composers who had their own unique voice nevertheless.The performances are good, although in this rarely heard music there are not many points for comparison."
4,"Good book, but Get ""The White Panther"" if you can find it","This is an enjoyable book, if a bit of an anachronism. Dont allow yourself to be PC'ed into not enjoying it. Waldeck had an interesting life and I find his writing style enjoyable, even though, like I said, it is a bit dated. ""Treks across the Veldt"" is also very good, but ""The White Panther"" is head and shoulders above anything Waldeck has written. Unfortunately, all these books are going to cost you 40 bucks or so. ""The White Panther"" is especially costly and hard to find. I got lucky and was the sole bidder for a copy on Ebay and so I did Ok. The other books can be sometimes be found at a more reasonable price. Most likely, if these books were not an integral part of your childhood you wont want to pay so much for them, but if you can find them at an OK price you should enjoy adding them to your library."
4,Chair Covers,Your Clear Vinyl Chair Protectors are fine. We have grandchildren and a dog.I don't like the open corners. I'll have to tape them down even tho I know they won't stay. But the plastic will save my new chair covers for awhile.
5,Great screen for the price,This screen was perfect for presentations in the school. It is a nice screen and is big enough for a large room. It was easy to put together and easy to move.
5,Great purchase!,Ordered this for my church and it worked out perfectly. Great screen size and I received it super fast. Thanks!
3,Kindle version coments,"The Kindle version of this book lacks page numbers, which makes following it difficult for classroom use when the professor says ""on page...."". Also in chapter three there is a note regarding the formatting: ""Here we follow the convention of writing postulated semantic elements in small capitals to distinguish them from real words."" However, in the text, I checked the Kindle version against a classmate's paper version & found that the Kindle version does not have the small caps in the text, making it difficult to make this distinction. Nonetheless, I think it will still be usable - I will update if I find myself needing to return it for a paper version."
4,"Great product, high quality construction","The layout of my apartment is quite unique and features a den that open to the living room. There's really only one good place to locate the couch, loveseat and TV and unfortunately all of it is visible from where I put my desk in the den. This room divider was the perfect size to keep me from getting distracted while working from home and is holding up quite well despite our cats playing with the shutters and guests occasionally folding it up wrong so that it tips over. I would recommend this screen to anyone trying to separate two rooms from each other tastefully and discretely."
2,Product arrived with shudders broken,"I ordered two of these rood dividers for the Lifeguards that I manage so they would have a way to rest without being gauked at my my pool patrons. The product works very well. However, when it arrived both sets had at least one shudder that was either broken or had pieces missing. Also, there we places where the paint had chipped off due to dent in the wood. Product works nicely but very low quality for $200 a piece. I wont be going thru that company anymore."
1,"A tiresome, sophomoric journey","Oprah's ""journal""? She knew we'd be reading it and that's exactly how it reads. Her ""innermost"" thoughts were, as always, for an outermost audience. I knew what she'd say before she said it. What a ripoff!"
3,"Porter Hill's ""Bombay Marines""","Billed in the style of Horatio Hornblower, Porter Hill's characters are more reminiscent of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series. Naval adventure from the 1800's in an easily digestible pulp form."
5,Work Great,Work great and very satisfied. Use weekly for about 4 months. Have washed twice (We bought several and rotate) with no problems. Easy to see-thru.
2,Not a good influence!,she is wearing animal skin! and this is for little girls! do you want to imprint in them that killing animals for thier skin is ok? not to mention ILLEGAL! (the animal skin part)
2,Well...,"Um, peeps, does anyone agree with me? This doll is dressed up as a show girl, for crying out loud!"
3,fun euro-pop sampler,i just returned from europe with this cd in my luggage. it features the songs that were blaring in every chic clothing store and were being hummed by teenagers and cops on the beat everywhere from amsterdam to jerusalem. an infectious collection of european dance pop.
3,98 caplets is misleading,"I had first tried the Extra Strength Estroblend, which is the Walmart brand. With the Walmart brand you just take 1 tablet per day. However, with the ESTROVEN maximum strength, you have to take two tablets at one time. So if you are trying to compare prices, you need to be aware of that. I did not see anything in the advertisement that said you take 2 per day, so I feel it is a bit misleading when you are trying to comparison shop. I hope this information will help someone else. As for if it works or not, I will have to give it more time to see."
1,The worst product I've gotten from Amazon,"We ordered the Dramm 12706 Revolver 9-Pattern Premium Garden Hose Nozzle, Berry color, and to put it nicely, the ordering was the best part of ownership. the proiduct has not worked correctly since day one, with waster squirting out between the berry controller and the black sprayer. We will never order a Dramm agai. Just plain bad."
1,Junk,"These are supposed to last for years. Ours lasted TWO MONTHS-just long enough to be outside of amazon's return timeframe. Three of the four I bought leak so badly I am throwing them out.(And two of them arrived broken, so that really means 5/6 didn't last one summer.) I faithfully drain the water out of them after each use, so it can't be excess pressure. They only reason the 4th one doesn't leak is because I've only used it twice.They leak horribly:about 75% of the water leaks out of the sides, leaving the remaining 25% to dribble out of whatever the dial is set to. No mist, no jet, no soaker. Just a gush of water getting all over my hand and nothing on my plants.An email to the company went unanswered.UPDATE: Dramm's Customer Service rep finally answered us. We emailed pictures of the dripping nozzles and the company- NOT amazon- replaced them all. Let's see how long these last..."
3,OK for price,I purchased two of these nozzles from Amazon because I had previously purchased one from a retail store for a couple of dollars more and liked the unit. Unfortunately the outside protective rubber on the rotating section of one of the units I received from Amazon was defective and is splitting open. The unit still functions but is cosmetically flawed.
1,Big heavy and useless,"This is the worst hose nozzle I ever used. It is really heavy and awkward...holding the lever down is uncomfortable and none of the spray choices works well except for ""shower"" which dribbles a bit and unless you keep pressure on the lever, it is much too weak. I hate this nozzle. The jet spray is a joke and the other sprays barely work. I prefer mymuch cheaper half broken nozzle where the spray is controlled by the pressure you put on the lever."
3,A little more knowledge,"As I do not have it yet, I am not going to rate it ... However I wanted to provide the following informaiton:Artist: The ServantAlbum: Cells (Single) - Germany 2005Tracks:1 .... Cells (Radio edit)2 .... Cells (Instrumental) (Sin City Trailer)3 .... In a Public PlaceYes, if you have been looking for the Sin City version of ""Cells"" it can be found on this CD."
4,HAUNTING STORIES THAT NEED TO BE TOLD,"The Good Women of China is a riveting, powerful read. The mix of stories is an excellent selection to give us a glimpse of the wide range of problems the women of China face and the indignities they continue to endure. One reviewer said Xinran wasn't truthful in her reports and over dramatised events. I disagree. I have read enough of the plight of women in China to feel these stories, in their simplicity, are probably the most ""truthful"" accounts I have read. Considering her own personal story, it would have taken a lot for Xinran to put pen to paper to share these with us, but I am grateful that she did. The chapters that haunt me the most are those about The Guomindang General's Daughter and The Woman Whose Father Did Not Know Her. I defy readers not to be moved ."
1,the good women of china:Hidden voices,Did not care for this book at all. First book about Chinese women I did not like. Would not recommend this.
1,hard to believe stories,"I am reading this book right now and I have to say that I find it hard to believe, not because of the circumstance that these women find themselves in because people the world over suffer many atrocities, but because the writer seems to be embelleshing the stories. It seems made up like she is sharing a fairy tale. At one pioint I placed the book down on my lap and thought to myself that these stories are either not real or totally adorned for the sake of drama. I am really disappointed in the lack of genuiness and reality of the stories. It would have been better if told as if these were true stories. Sadly disappointed."
4,Moving testimony,I don't know why readers are giving this book such a hard time for its style. I like the book's personal style. It makes me love it as opposed to like it. The writer's emotions are close to the surface and provide a particularly engaging way of gaining insight into the Cultural Revolution. I personally don't believe the book is fiction and even if the author creates in her characters composites of various women's experiences the book would still have great value.
3,English translation,"In the introduction to this book, the English speaking reader should have been told that some stories were ""translations"". As a reader, I thought the author had related the personal accounts herself, with all the emotions and drama she had felt. The reader who was paying attention, could tell the difference in the tone of the wording/writing when there was a change in writing styles. I felt a disconnect at times with the words chosen and the essence of the subject.I have had a long time interest in China and attempt to read a wide range of topics addressing the differences in our cultures. I did find several commonalities between the US morals in the 1950s and China in the 1990s. Still, even in the 21st century, it's the woman who is ""pregnant"" sometimes spoken as tho she did it alone. Thanks for the book. gina Cassidy"
1,Don't bother,"These are supposed to keep my newborn from scratching her face, but they are WAY too big for her. She still doesn't fit them at 8 weeks. Waste of shipping charge."
1,a mere catalog?one star is too much.,don't waste your money on a cheap paper with awful reproduction of colors.
4,"Great Screen, but very heavy.","I use a screen for classroom presentations. This screen is a good buy, but it very heavy to transport. A case would probably be a good investment to protect the screen, but they are half the cost of the screen. Guess I'm just a tight wad!"
3,"Solid set, maybe too solid!","I bought this set for my daughter who is 23 months old. We have a small kitchen and this set fit perfectly into the corner. (BTW, Fred Meyer had this exact same set in their 2008 Christmas toy catalogue for $50 but only available in blue or pink.) Shortly after I'd assembled it, my daughter hit her head against the edge of the table. Don't know how it happened but she hit her temple and the cut was so deep my doctor recommended stitches. She did not hit the corner of the table, just one of its edges. The edge of this table and the chairs are *very square*. It's still a great table -- very solid. I'm now very careful when my daughter is around it. I'm sure as she gets older I won't need to worry as much but I thought others contemplating this purchase should be aware of any potential hazards."
1,fell apart in two weeks,"One leg came off of the table the first week - the screw inserts pulled out, so we couldn't just re-tighten it. We tacked it back together with angle brackets and the wood split while screwing in the bracket. Now one of the chairs is coming apart. We have one two year old who isn't being tough on it, it's just not that well made. We got this in a discount store for thirty bucks, so I'm not too upset, but still, I would have expected better."
1,broke within a week,"We bought this for my kids last Christmas (2009). They were 3 and 1 - the kids were so excited about the table and chairs. they are not rough kids and within a week the table legs were broke - just from normal play. they used the table to have tea parties, color, etc. do not recommend product!"
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this set. It is not solid wood, feels plastic, and is shoddy in manufacturing quality. Does not hold together, wobbles. My husband had to glue and clamp it in some places so that we could use it. I will use it for my toddlers, until it falls apart, which won't be too long I'm sure."
2,Not my cup of Tea,"My wife loves this guys music. So of his songs are catchy, but ofr the most part I skip it evertime he comes up on the IPOD. I think you should check out someone elses review for this one."
2,large print actually only pt 10,OK so this dictionary may have larger print than most others but its still only 10pt. This is no good for my daughter who borrows large print books from rnib. Ideally she needs about 20pt. I never use 10pt for my typing as I think it is too small and I do not have a visual impairment. A bit disappointed - but I can't find any dictionary with larger print. Amazing lack of product for visually impaired
5,Dave helped me,"I must give Dave Hollister credit where it is due. I will be the first to admit that I have a weakness for r&b; music.When I heard my favorite singer Dave Hollister had a gospel cd out, I knew I had to hear it for myself.I absolutely love the cd from beginning to end.I can honestly say that Dave makes me want to listen to Gospel music.I have a long way to go in my walk with God...and I want people to know Dave Hollister has helped lead me towards the right path."
3,Book of David Vol 1,"I like a few songs on this cd. One big negative about this album was a series of songs that were NOT gospel, just him venting about his divorce. He does have an incredible voice, and i feel with a little more age he will be good. It was an okay first gospel effort."
3,A decent effort,"I liked a lot of the songs. I just wish he had made some of the interludes, full-fledged songs. The interludes were better than some of the songs. However, his sincerity on the song ""Let Heaven Down"" salvaged a lot of the other tracks. That was definitely the song that made me give the entire cd a chance. It is not a gospel cd as it is billed, but it is a journey inside of a man's pain and triumph. Dave acknowledged that he made the wrong choices despite Christ's urging him to live right. It is refreshing to here someone be so honest about how the pleasures of not following Christ are temporal. The production is decent. His voice is decent on this cd. So, it's an all around decent album."
3,Give me Miles...not Jerry,"Miles Davis songs by Garcia, while interesting isn't much of a tribute to the venerable hornsman. The ""So What"" cover doesn't have the laid back ""shrug of the shoulders"" that the original has. Jerry certainly improvised as well as any of them, but I think he was *much* better on his own compositions. He doesn't do Miles and bebop jazz any justice. The CD still gets 3-stars just for the sheer audacity of it all."
5,All You Could Wish For!,"Peter Holman directs the Parley of Instruments in a performance of fantasias and dances by Orlando Gibbons (c1583-1625) and Thomas Lupo (c1571-1627).""The playing of the Parley is all that could be wished for"" (Fanfare, USA)The works on this recording:ORLANDO GIBBONS Fantasias a 4 'for the great double bass'No 1No 2THOMAS LUPO Fantasy-airs a 3No 20No 16No 17ORLANDO GlBBONS Fantasias a 3 'for the great double bass'No 1No 2Galliard a 3THOMAS LUPO Fantasy-airs a 4No 5No 6No 7ORLANDO GIBBONS Fantasias a 3No 5No 6No 7No 8No 9THOMAS LUPO Fantasy-airs a 4No 11No 12ORLANDO GIBBONS Fantasias a 3 'for the great double bass'No 3No 4THOMAS LUPO Fantasies a 4No 4No 9"
5,Mere words cannot express...You must experience it!,"This was the first Francis Ray book I read and I must say I was knocked off my feet! I have ordered all of her books and will continue to purchase and read everyone that is published. Francis Ray takes the sleaze out of the typical so-called ""romance novels"" and makes romance, ROMANTIC again. This book as well as the entire Taggert series should be made into a movie or a mini-series. Surely if Stella (Terry) can show get her groove back on the Big Screen then there MUST be someone out there to help Francis show her stuff! Any takers? If you are tired of the same old no thought, sleazy books and ready to experience a REAL author, then read this and ALL of Francis Ray's Books! I guarantee you WON""T be dissappointed!"
3,Fair Fetch,"I loved the characters, as it is in all of Ray's novels, but some of the plot was a bit fair fetch for me. I would have liked something more believable in the end, bu I guess that's why we call it an imagination."
5,A lovely book to dig into a random,"One of those lovely books you don't have to read from cover to cover all in one go, but can keep dipping into for daily uplifting and inspiration. I received mine as a gift and its so good I've now given my friends a copy."
5,Titanic like shipwreck remembered,"David Zeni has written a comprehensive novel on the sinking of the Empress Of Ireland. He weaves the cast of characters through the tragic sinking. He left no stone unturned in his research. There are the wealthy: Sir Henry Seton Karr, Grace Dunlevy, and Sabina Grundy. The famous: The Irvings'. And the tragic: Fanny Mounsey among 1000 others who perished. If you collect ocean liner books- this one belongs on your shelf."
5,So That We Should Never Forget,"I've read this book many times and each time, I discover more things that I didn't realize the first time around. The book is both incredible and beautiful. It is a wonderful tribute to a terrible tragedy that never should have happened. Unfortunately, it did happen.Each chapter is unique and different from the one before it. Yet, they all tie in together to make a story of such intrigue that I have found it hard to put down each time I've read it!I'm certainly glad that Mr. Zeni wrote this gripping story. It is obvious that a lot of research and detail went into its preparation. I would like to thank Mr. Zeni for writing this magnificent book."
2,Not what I expected....,"Melanie B is the best live performer of the Spice Girls. She has a raw energy on stage that makes her a rock star! Unfortunately, this did not come across in her solo album 'Hot'. Vocally, I thought that Melanie B would have been the best Spice Girl to capture that danceable, happy, poppy sound that made them so famous. ""Feels so good"" is the only song on the album that has that pop sound 'hook' that every good song needs. I think that her next album could be much better if she shows more of her bad girl 'edge', and also by using new songwriters."
2,not what I expected,"Melanie B is the best performer of the Spice Girls. She is electric on stage, and her and Melanie C definately have the best live singing voices. I was expecting to hear some of that 'live energy' in her solo album, but it just wasn't there. The Spice Girls became famous for their happy, danceable, upbeat music. Melanie B should have stuck with that type of music on her first solo album. The song choices on her album were bad, and it is very obvious that she needs new song writers. Mel B has the talent to do better, and I hope that she does on her second solo album!"
3,Good R&B mixed with Spice,"Mel B does a good job with this cd. Her vocals are great and the beats wonderful. Definately worth buying since the artist is no long with Virgin and who knows when she will put out a second album. My only complaint is that it is mostly about her tattered love life and nothing more. Though she did sing a song about her son, ""Lullaby"", which is absolutely adorable similiar in tone to the song Maddona sang for her child, ""Little Star""."
2,"Mel B ""Hot""","okay, i own all of the Spice girls solo debuts and out of them all this one just doesn't... well it trys to be good r&b but it falls short of that goal. there are some good tracks, ""feels so good"", ""hell no"", ""i want you back"", but the rest don't stand out and you forget about them. If i were to rank the spice girls on who's debut was the best and who's the worst it would look like this1) Northern Star - Mel C2) Victoria Beckham3) Girl like me - Emma Bunton4) Schizophonic - Geri Halliwell/ Hot - Mel B (tied)""hot"" is good, but it just doesn't hit the spot."
1,very disappointed...,The title is hot..but this album left me cold...Don't waste your pocket money on this one!!The spice girls should stop singing and just marry footballers..
1,Don't waste your money.,"This unit is comical - really. Imagine a ""hi fi"" turntable that doesn't allow you to install another cartridge. Imagine a ""hi fi"" turntable that doesn't have a tonearm with a counter balance weight and anti-skate control. Aren't these ""basic features""? This thing is a glorified ""close and play"" made of cheap plastic. Denon should be ashamed of itself for putting it's name on such a low end product. And by the way, the sound quality is equally lame. I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected a decent level of quality from a unit with Denon's name on it. Seriously, this unit isn't worth more than $50. You would be better off buying something used. I didn't do my homework on this unit, and I got burned. Thanks, Denon."
2,Works Great! For about two years.,"Finally an affordable quality turtable by Denon....wait a minute.It plays records okay, but just after two years of owning it, I'm sending it in for repairs. THESE ARE NOT BUILT WELL, SCRATCH EASILY, AND LOOK CHEAP!!!!! AND The lid never closed all the way. After spending money on a high end receiver, cd player, ipod docking station, infinity speakers, the ""good"" cables, I was really let down by how this looked/sounded/functioned (it is clunky at best). Examine one before you buy!!!Save up your money, and buy a nicer (direct drive) unit. This is a prime example of getting what you pay for."
5,squrt 29,"Very real, a page turner that I found impossible to put down. You feel the abuse, the cold and the gradual physical beating down of the BUDS students as they face the elements and the dark side of their instructors.Highly recommended1"
5,John Belli,"I have dedicated the last 12 years helping to fulfill the dream of Mario Lanza which was to provide scholarships for young classical singers. In that time I have read all of the books written about him. This book is without a doubt the one I can agree with and recommend to others. There are no falsehoods or hidden secrets here. The authors had no ""agenda"" other than in telling the truth. I am on my third reading and am still impressed with the sincerity of the authors and the writers of individual chapters. Each chapter has a special quality and the writers made me feel that I have not wasted my time. I can only hope there will be another book in the future by these authors."
1,Does not work as claimed.,"This item does not keep items frozen/cold as long as it claims. I haven't had them leak, however I am very disappointed to have them not work. Nice concept, but the technology isn't there."
4,Very nice beret.,I wish they were completely lined. the band around the beret is too rigid. but a great fit for me.
4,Sets the pulses tingling,"The Piano Concerto in E Major, op 59 by Moritz Moszkowski is a thing of beauty. As the liner notes aptly state: ""if it fails to stir the intellect, it sets the pulses tingling."" The opening Moderato does indeed tingle. The playing on the Adante is exceptional. Pianist Piers Lane acquits himself very well of the Scherzo. The finale is ravishing.The Moszkowski is coupled with Paderewski's Piano Concerto in A minor. A little less refined and more bombastic than the Moszkowski, it also is deserving of a wider audience.Piers Lane does a wonderful job on the entire disc. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Jerzy Maksymiuk, handles the task at hand in a creative and faithful manner.Hyperion deserves laurels for unearthing these gems. I recommend this disc."
3,"Box should say ""Tested with Linux--but not Red Hat!""","Just a warning that this card is incompatible with Red Hat 6.2. Of course it is my fault for not checking compatibility before I bought, however, the sticker on the box has a nice picture of a penguin, and says ""Tested with Linux!"" so Linksys looks good to people jumping on the Linux bandwagon, like me. But isn't it rather lame that this ""generic"" card isn't compatible with the most popular Linux distribution in N. America? If I had found Red Hat's 6.2 hardware compatibility page, I wouldn't have bought this card:http://www.redhat.com/support/hardware/intel/62/rh6.2-hcl-i.ld-11.htmlWin Me recognized it with no problems, big whup."
4,works fine,I had problems installing the driver into my Windows 98. I called customer support at 8pm Pacific Time and they answered within 10 mins. In less than five minutes we got the software installed and I haven't had any problems since. I am using it to connect my DSL. Good luck.
1,Does NOT work with Linux,"Contrary to what you would believe, this product will not work with any distribution of Linux."
2,Be careful if you need WOL,"If you don't care about WOL the card works fine. My system requires a 3-pin WOL cable to connect the LAN card to the system board. The LNE100TX item description says it has one, but the card that came (version 5) does not have this type of interface. Check for compatibility before you buy it!! I ended up returning mine."
1,Stay away,"Stay away from Linksys cards. I build small business networks for a living. Many customers buy Linksys cards becuase they are inexpensive, but alway end up regreting it. Installation is easy but once you start to use it, you will notice that your computer will be more prone to crashes and mouse problems. I have tried the cards on Compaqs, Dells, and generic machines running Win 98, ME, NT4 and Win2000 and have problems with them all. You get what you pay for!"
5,Easy to use.,"For some reason the ethernet port on my MOBO would not show up, so I purchased this to hard wire my router into my DSL modem. This was done trying to get the MagicJack to work, it did not help. One good thing did happen though, my on-board ethernet port showed up and all's good with that now. THIS BOARD IS DOING AS GOOD AS CAN BE EXPECTED."
5,"Really, what could go wrong with a boom arm?",The threads are the correct size for the stand. If it is tightened properly it won't slip. It's been kicked over a few times and nothing broke (expect the grill on my mic).
3,Great Album by Candlelight,"The main reason i bought this album was because of two earlier albums I had puchased. The tracks are sensual and relaxing. McGovern's voice shines. One of the best tracks are #8 ""How are things in Glocca Morra"" from the musical Finians Rainbow. With Mike Renzi on Piano McGovern shines again. Move over Striesand!"
1,A legend in their OWN mind!,"""CUT"" denotes the awful re-editing of this film, crappy monochromatice overlays, and use of cheesy filters to add atmosphere. The added scenes (claiming to enchance the background of the story) are entirely [...]! *read my reviews of other films, you'll see that I tend to be tolerant. THIS film was a complete trashing of the original and went into the garbage the same moment I finished it. It was NOT worth taking up what little shelf space it had been slated for. For the love of GOD, don't [...] on this - buy a powderpuff girls video or anything else, but this pile of grbage."
3,New bratz character a failure,"Tiana isn't that pretty compared to the others. She is a new character, but I don't think they should have given her huge glasses and the red highlights on the bangs are so ugly. I would recommend getting another person. I'm sure they will release another Tiana in another set. MGA usually does that."
1,please no,"I love Bratz to death, so i had to get it. When i took it out of the box, the cheap acessories fell apart, the arm got loose, and the hair mixed together; making it all tangled up. All i can say, is please don't waste your money on this doll. This is the absolute worst Bratz doll i have ever recived, ever. The feet also fall of easily, and the legs are bent in a weird way. I wouldn't recomend this to you, unless you just want to waste your money in exchange for a terrible doll."
1,BLUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,EVERYONE KNOWS MY SCENE ARE COOLIER!BARTZ FANS DONT EVAN NOW HOW TO SPEL!MY SCENE ARE COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL BRATZ ARE FOOOOOOOOOOLZ........................MY SCENE ARE SOOOOOOOOOO BETTER THAN THE BARTZ! BARBIES ARE GOOD TO BUT BRATZ ARE BAD FOER CHILDREN!SO SHUT UP BRATZ FANS. GO SUCK ON A COOKIE!
1,Game didnt work,i was very dissapointed by this buy the game looked new but it didnt work so im guessing i was sold a disk with a cover on it
4,"Fun, large, high replay","This game is alot of fun it's an origional x-box and it was perfect just the way it was. The game has a street fight story mode with levels of obstacles, horde fights and vs style boss fights. It is a blast!"
4,A great game...,"As this was a gift I am writing this review on behalf of my brother. He really enjoys playing the game and described it as ""playing in a superhero movie."" I hope you enjoy it, too."
1,If you want to weed out nursing students this is your book.,"I was required to use this book my first semester of nursing school and it is absolutely ridiculous. I will bet money that this book was written to weed out nursing students. Way too much clutter in this book as well as boring. If efficient and stimulating learning is your ultimate goal here then is is not your book. TO ANY 1ST SEMESTER STUDENTS OUT THERE: if you really enjoy clinicals and have this book as your intro nursing fundamentals class just stick with it, endure and it gets much better with the med-surg book in the next semesters."
1,An Excruciatingly Painful Experience,"I am an honors student and hold a PhD in a related health care field. This book is the worst piece of garbage I have encountered in my entire academic career. It is wordy, convoluted, and makes concepts/procedures more difficult than they actually are. I cannot believe any nursing program would inflict this book on their students. What's even worse, is that in Canada, this text is the standard used for the nursing board exams. I too, would rate it a ""zero"" if I could."
1,"If this is your school's required textbook, too bad for you!","This book is horrible! Repetitive, verbose - a total waste of a busy nursing student's time."
1,"Unorganized, worthless","I felt compelled to warn others about this book. It is unorganized, combersome, wordy, inaccurate, and talks in circles. Interestingly, Mosby/elsevier published Lewis' med-surg nursing, which is also poorly written. In fact, anything published by Mosby is absolute garbage, including their drug book, nurse aid book, and patho book. Anyway, I read texts often and know a good one from a bad one. This rates a -10."
5,fundamentals of nursing,"this book is known as the bible in my career of nursing. this book tells you how to diagonose your client, it teaches you how to do a care plan for your client and it tells you deviations within each body system.thank for this book it will always be apart of my collection now and forever."
3,"Entertaining, but not Best's best.","Pete Best is famous more for his associations than his accomplishments. As Beatles historians know, he was The Beatles drummer until the band kicked him out in 1962 and replaced him with Ringo Starr. The rest, tritely said, is history.The music on the album is ok. I enjoyed it for its historical value more than its musical content, but I don't think the recordings did Best justice. Listen to the Hamburg sessions the Beatles did with Tony Sheridan...Pete Best was the better drummer."
5,Best CD!!,This CD is the best I have ever gotten! The songs keep me soooooooo refreshed and I never get bored! I don't know what it might be but this CD is the best J-Pop CD I have ever gotten! It was also the first! If you love Gundam than this CD is right for you! It covers about all of the Gundam Wing series and other too! Please buy it! (The price is kinda high though.....)^_^
2,Suppose to be great like before but it's not,"Don't take me wrong i love the smell of Pino Silvestre but i think either i received the fake one or company has changed its formula(I bought it from Amazon). When i use mine, The smell disappear within 30 minutes??!!! I'm not kidding. To me smell very very very mild, Like it has been mixed with a lots of water. I'm a fan of this cologne but i'm sorry to say, something is wrong here and my review is based on what i received and not what it might have been.I'm going to buy one more from another vender to see how the smell like and i'll update my rating and review accordingly."
1,long and tired,Wittgenstein's Poker was delightful. This is not. It's filled with detail that is not compelling nor germaine to the issue at hand. It may be the issue at hand is really not that interesting. Hence the need to pad it with redundant details.The best thing that could have happened to this book is a good edit. It's worth about half to two thirds the pages used to present a relatively simple tale of two radically dissimilar spirits and intellects. Perhaps if it had focused on these elements in more depth it may have produced the substance the authors try to conjure. As it is there really isn't the stuff of drama and the information packed into the book is only mildly interesting. It reads much more like gossip than their previous effort. Though such were the times.I like the premise these authors have set out. There IS real drama within the history of philosophy and the debates that philosophy has engendered. There may be here. I'm not sure. But I wasn't convinced by this read.
1,Hard to trust,"Anyone who can say, on page 6, that a man whose mother's death when he is 10 days old causes him to ""suffer from a devastating loss and its concomitant anger"" is more a cliched than a clear thinker."
4,Nice item but overpriced,"The table and chairs are a nice item, but it's not worth over $100. You could get a very similar item from a discount store (Target, Sam's, Costco) and save money and be just as happy."
4,Nice solid set,I ordered this set to replace a smaller toddler table we had outgrown. The entire set needs to be assembled but it took less than half hour to do it. It feels nice and solid and so far I am very impressed with the quality. More importantly my kids love it and use it every day.
1,Works great for a few months,"I bought one of these in September, and DVD player stopped working in January. The controls are sluggish and feel very cheap. Often a button must be pressed several times before anything happens. Pick something else for a media server and buy a regular DVD player."
3,Just curious about Lincoln's life,It's not an easy read but from time to time i read a bit then a bit more later. I'll make it to the end but no time soon. If you're into history it will be a valuable book to have. The price is right! :)
3,Summarizing what you already know,"This book by Mr. Schmeltz does have some helpful hints and strategies for conducting yard/garage sales, but the majority of the information, I personally feel, is already known or common sense to those that have held these types of sales before. I would only recommend this book to first timers and those who need the extra push to get organized."
2,Predictable,"I found that the characters are likeable. The general pace of the book such that it made the book a fast read. However, the plot, as promising as it was, was completely predictable. If you are a hardcore mystery buff, I would definitely go elsewhere."
3,not enough images,I bought this book for research for my tea import business. The history of the design for tea was very interesting and well researched. I feel that the author was limited by a budget or something because really this should be a high-volume image book to fully describe the designs. It is a facinating look at the history and culture of tea design.
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"Ok - good ""idea,"" but whoever put it together was not creative. These are the 6 terrible phrases they chose to use on this overpriced pen:* I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. get her done* The schruites produce very thristy babies* I'm the head of this family & you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin* this is an environment of welcoming, and you should just get the hell out of here* These are my party planning beeyatches* Ooo. Discipline. Kinky."
2,"Oh, please.....","Honestly, it is just amazing to me that an author can make money from a publication (I refuse to even refer to this as a ""book"") with the kind of obvious advice that amounts to ""Be careful at night, study hard and eat all your vegatables"". Don't waste your money on this, this book can be read in 5 minutes in any store without paying for it. Several other reviewers have recommended more helpful and meaty sources of helpful advice for the college student and I concur. Pass this one up."
4,Los Sobraos -takes you higher,"This album is something special. It contents many different styles and genres, not only the disco style. The group sings in spanish to disco music, with a little touch of flamenco. Sometimes you can get a little bit bored over that the tempo is slowing down a little. But I think it's fenomenal done, because many of the artists that have tryed to put disco-music on together with their own culture music don't make it sound that well, but Los Sobraos has succeded with it! They're allready loved in Spain, and it's just a matter of time before they hit the world too."
4,You get what you pay for,"I only wanted fisheye lens for the sake of having fisheye pictures..(or probably more like snapshots). So nothing professional. The quality isn't the best and it creates a shadow when you use flash (so you need an extension). I personally like it for the money i spent for it but if you want a high quality lens, just wait and save up for the 700 dollar one"
3,Maybe even less than * * *,"I read it over this last weekend, and found it a bit incomplete for me. The large gaps in training, to bring a 15 year old, to Duelist Extraordinaire, in a span of six months, were a bit much for me to bridge. When the lead finally (I found myself muttering ""will something PLEASE happen) Duels for her friends honor, and fails to recognize her own brother (even though he does recognize her) I found myself waiting and waiting for the Bulb to go on, or at the very least, for it to be addressed in conversation with her mother later in the storyline, but to no avail!As an aside, I would not recommend this book for younger readers, depending on their maturity level."
3,Starts very quickly...,"This book starts off really fast and ends too quickly for me. I didn't like Katherine's uncle for what he did to her family. I liked her and her family. I couldn't stand Lord Ferris because he seemed like quite a sinister character! How things differ in Warrior and Witch are some of the female characters are more aggressive. On the other hand, the female characters in this book are more 3 dimesional and believable."
1,Pointless,"After struggling through 1/3 of the book I gave up. It is not interesting, not well written, and is boring. After a very good ""Swordpoint"", and a mediocre ""The Fall of the Kings"" the quality keeps on plunging. I will not be buying anymore Kushner's novels."
5,I'm Impressed,Just got this book and I love it. I purchased it based on reviews that I read and they are 100% correct. Beautiful pictures and a touching poem. Great as a wedding gift.
5,A delightful taste of both artists,"Sometimes when you combine two spices, the result isn't too wonderful. But that's not the case here. Putting these two artists together was a wonderful inspiration. This is a keeper!"
3,Use larger font size and a different color print,"This book is very cute but the print color is hard to read and the font is too small for me. Wish I had it on my Kindle, at least I could change the font size."
5,Poor Child,"I really feel sorry for the child whose mother has to return this tent just because it is difficult to store. If my child is happy, then so am I... all you have to do is take the medal rod out of the top and it almost fall to where it has to be stored. You twist.. Why take a childs toy away because it difficult to store, just read the directions. ??"
3,You need to love case studies.,Rossi is a marvelous theorist and his process of growth is spectacular. Most of the book however is a case study and I tired of reading someone else's dreams. I will read more Rossi.
5,Charming!,"Children will ""root"" for these two delightful friends who venture out of their safe garden and into the wide world! The concept of a melon and a turnip breaking free and traveling is great imaginative fun, and the world they discover together is full of wonder, meaning, challenge, danger and beauty. A lovely book."
3,This one didn't make me press the repeat button............,I was not quite up to my expectations from Brother Houghton. I know times are changing and so do the styles of many artisit. Maybe next Christmas.
5,'80s CLASSICS....BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.,"THIS IS AN AWESOME COMPILATION OF '80s CLASSICS, IN REMIX or EXTENDED VERSIONS. [I SPECIALLY LOVE, WHEN IN ROME - THE PROMISE]ALSO, DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE PREVIOUS VOLs [1 &2]...[MxMallo]"
2,Grand National,"Arrived in a timely fashion. I don't think it is John Butler's best cd, I do enjoy it all the same."
5,My niece loves them,These were purchased to go with the Crayola Crayon Maker. I think the price is a little high for crayons but my niece loves sparkles and glitter so they were perfect for her.
3,Not very metallic,These crayons are OK. They are more glittery than metallic. The sparkles could be fun for kids though. My daughter hasn't used them much yet.
1,Glitter does NOT Transfer to the Paper.,"Received a package of these as part of a gift for triplets 4th birthday.When you color, the glitter part of the crayons just presses into the crayon and does not transfer to the paper.I colored an area the size of my hand a solid color - there was 1 speck of glitter in the whole area.Not impressed with these crayons. Save your money and purchased something else!"
4,A Classic,"Classic early 70's Ray Barretto...some of the songs overlap with other albums, i.e. ""Mirame de Frente"" (Hard Hands), ""Hipocresia y Falsedad"", ""Invitacion al Son"" ""Quitate la Mascara"" ""Adiviname y Olvidate"" (Together)...released in 1971."
2,Way too Salty,"Bought this book based on the reviews. Haven't had a change to use low sodium soy sauce yet, but I can tell you for sure that if you use regular soy sauce with these receipts you're going the end up with extremely salty Jerky!!! Wait, I meant really extremly salty Jerky. My biggest disappointment was that the author didn't make that clear, she only included a small note in the front like ""some people choose to use low sodium soy sauce"". She should have put in big print ...YOU'D BE CRAZY TO USE REGULAR SOY SAUCE. I messed up some good dear meat with regular soy sauce so here's to hoping that I can save you that mistake with this book."
5,The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"This was truly one of the best books I have ever read. I was enthralled from the first page. What I found most interesting was the story's relevance for today's woman, even though it was written so long ago. Anne Bronte was ahead of her time. Many of the issues we hear about today, like co-dependancy and abusive relationships, are included in this story. I think it is fascinating. This was a story that I was sorry to have end. I wanted every woman that I know to read it!"
4,Offshoot of Ebbolution,"Though some will consider my words blasphemy, I think NE's first two EP's are only okay and they began to really show their talent with Showtime and just got better after that. I like these covers of the releases from That Total Age much better than the originals, and I find the covers of Control I'm Here interesting. Toohill's vocals are great and match the music quite well. Only 4 stars for not enough variety in songs."
1,Switch is ver Poor,"I'm on my 4th switch now, the first one quit working when I washed my bike, the 2nd & 3rd fried and quit working with no water involved. I just read another review where a guy said that his quit working after he hit a rain storm. You would think that a company like Kuryakyn would make a quality waterproof switch, after all the Lizard light cost about 350 and I was hoping for top quality."
4,Very elegant,This decanter brings style to the table! One star deduction for difficult to clean. The design is simple but elegant - good german quality!
4,Keeps me glued to the book,This is definitely a recommended book for all to read! The story is original and it depicts the emotions and love between the characters vividly!I can't stop reading once I started reading. It keeps me glued to the book!
3,Enough Already,"Please. Could this man praise himself or ex-Mayor Giuliani any more? While Mr. Kerik's story is inspirational in some respects, the constant pats on the back that he gives himself are a real turn off. I got the message after the initial string of self-compliments ... this is a great man doing great things. There's no need to hear it ad nauseum. Yes, and he also lets us know what a great man Giuliani is. Maybe. Maybe not. This book is filled with all sorts of macho stuff with the forces of good fighting the forces of evil. Kerik has filled the pages with a lot of interesting stories and has clearly established himself as a superman on the side of the good."
4,"Good characters, bad gaffe","I really like Carlotta and her accompanying cast. The plot works well enough; it gives the characters room to be themselves. But it's hard to take anything she has to say about Harvard very seriously after she puts the victim on an athletic scholarship. (A central tenet of the Ivy League is outlawing athletic scholarships, been that way since its founding. And no, I did not go to an Ivy.)"
1,No seal-Leaked everywhere,"My bottle came without any food-safe seals--no outside shrink wrap and no inner seal. The bottle was not broken as it was covered in bubble wrap, but the inside of the box was coated in oil. I did not feel comfortable eating this product and I could not send back a leaky, oily bottle so I had to toss it."
3,"ok,just okay","This book is not very imaginative and I guess for a new cook ,it fills the bill.Her special on Food Network in India was fascinating,as well as Spain,.Her stint on Melting Pot was a decent introduction to Indian Cooking. But this book was trying to be all things,from Salad Nicoise to Upma.The third star is for her effort,Recipes, so -so.She seems to have captured many peoples attention these days with Top Chef and her recent marriage,/divorce from Salman Rushdie and her scar,but where is the depth?Havent seen it yet."
1,"the pictures were great, the low-fat recipes were not","The recipes in this book are somewhat of a task. They require many different and exotic, sometimes hard to find ingredients. After cooking some of these recipes, I noticed the low-fat content was not so low. With all the ingrediants combined, some of these recipes are pretty high on fat and sodium. I was not impressed with this book."
2,BORING!,"Very boring interpertations, due in part to the recording quality. Sounds as if you were standing at the back of the catherdal. I'd like a recording to sound like I'm in the front row."
3,Seven oils? Maybe,"""Seven oils"" is more a fanciful name than a product description. This is your grandmother's mascara - petrolatum, beeswax, and parabens. At the bottom, it does say the mascara MAY contain several kinds of oil plus iron oxide.The inky black color is nicely saturated. Try not to blink until this dries or it will smear, but once on, it lasts pretty well - again, a lot like the old fashioned kind of mascara. It doesn't lengthen at all but may volumize a little if you put on several coats. Despite the waxy formula, it didn't make my lashes stiff.If you just need color, this is a nice black bargain option. If you need something that will enhance or treat your lashes, I'd say spend the extra money and try elsewhere."
3,didn't impress me,"Th' good thing was that the delivery was VERY fast. But product itself was quite disappointing. Brush was fat and short and it's pretty easy to make a mess all around your eye. Yes, it does make lashes longer but you have to put 2-3 layers for it. Also, it doesn't make lashes curly. So, it's ok waterproof mascara but definitely not 5 stars"
2,Great brush but dry mascara,"I was excited to see the very full mascara brush. It works great however, the mascara itself was dry. So I don't know if I just got an old bottle or if its always like that. Would definatly buy again if the mascara was new and normal consistancy."
4,Unadvertized pleasant surprises...,"As a phone -- it works. It does all of the things that a phone is supposed to do. Battery life and range is adequate though I haven't stress tested either.The big surprise -- Handset answering machine access. I don't recall reading about it in the marketing material and I think it is an extremely valuable feature.I've owned Panasonic before, as well as V-Tech and a few others. Panasonic always seems to exceed their competitors."
1,Panasonic Doesn't Mean Anything Anymore,"I purchased this set in October 2006 and by February of 2007 one of the handsets microphone stopped working and then the speaker went. I previously owned the Uniden two handset 2.4 and only upgraded because of moving into a larger home. Then I went to the V-Tech triple handset 5.4, this handset worked well for over a year, it took a licking before one of the handsets stopped working.I DO NOT suggest you purchase this phone.NOTICE: THERE IS ONLY A 90 WARRANTY ON THIS PRODUCT!!! EACH OF MY OTHER PURCHASES HAD ONE YEAR WARRANTIES?!!"
5,great phone,"Many great features, love the different rings for different people. Good simple answering machine, whole system is a space saver. We live in an area with poor telephone service and the sound is great and it has excellent range out of the house."
4,Panasonic KX-TG5633B 5.8 GHz,The only disadvantage that I have found with this phone is when electric service is disrupted you lose all previously programmed date/time/messaging. There is no battery compartment for backup purposes.
2,No speaker phone on the base,"I have always been satisfied with Panasonic phones: good reception, nice features. But this one was a disappointment. This phone is missing two important features that most phones in this price range have: Speaker phone on the base-unit, and beltclips for the handsets.Because I am not diligent about putting the phone back on the base, I ocassionally stumble over myself to find a handset when the phone rings. I loved the base-unit speaker phone feature on my former phones, and bought this because I thought it had it, but it doesn't. Additionally, I bought the headset, but there are no beltclips to clip the phone to yourself. Blah. Not a good phone unless you always wear shirts with front pockets (who does that?). I thought I did good research before my purchase, but I may have overlooked these two important features. I will continue to use my Motorola 7091 and give this to my sister."
4,acutally 4 1/2 starts...,"nice multiple handset 5.8G phone, I didn't give 5 starts because: 1. my previous Panasonic 2.4G phone has backlit keypad, this doesn't, inconvenient to use in low light, 2. does not come with belt clip, my old Panasonic does."
3,"Bling, Baby, Bling!","As costume jewelry goes, it's perfect. Too bad you'll be spammed to death by Pugster after just one order."
3,????????,"I really don't think this is a gundam cd, but if I'm wrong I will take this review down. I'm really sure its not though."
4,May work for someone else.,"Didn't seem to do much for our baby. She felt like the nipple was gagging her whenever we had her use it. Maybe she just had a petite mouth. Can't say for certain, but be warned if she likes the tiny nipple from the hospital, she may not enjoy these."
3,Great pacifier but too addictive,My 17 month old son loves this pacifier - however - the problem is that it is addictive! Babies love it so they don't want to be separate from it and he is contstantly asking for it. It was the first pacifier he was introduced to so her will not take any other pacifier. This is a huge headache because its very hard to find them in some stores and when we lost it while on vacation we had a very very hard day. Even though it is the best pacifier and the most satisfying for children I will NOT buy it again for my future kids because its so hard to find them and different from other pacifiers so if your child likes this one they won't take any other.
2,Baby hates it,I have no complain about the product...but the baby just do not like it...she takes any pacifier bu not this one... donno why..
5,MIRACLE! Only pacifier he doesn't spit out!,"I would travel 200 miles to get this thing! OH MY GOSH!!! I had twins 4 years ago and went through this SAME THING! Tried them all including the Wubbanub! NOTHING WOULD STAY IN! Now, 4 yrs later... AGAIN!! He spits them ALL out!Now I found this one!! YAHOOOOOOOOOO!!I went to THREE STORES yesterday to stock up!Buy it! It is a GREAT pacifier! It reminds me of the ONLY ones they had when I was a kid.. maybe there's something to that!"
4,Echo Company Rocks!,"I spent over 3 years looking for this book, and when I did find it I spent 15.00 for the 2.95 book. I believe it was worth it! If you like fiction, or Vietnam, or history you'll love this book. I originally read The Road Home, which is the continuation of the story of Michael Jennings and Rebecca Phillips. It was written by Ellen Emerson White; Zack Emerson was a pen name. READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Satellite Vent Mount,I am extremely disappointed with the two Satellite Vent Mounts I purchased. They are very flimsey and absolutely DO NOT ATTACH to the vents on my Ford Pick up. Once you think they're on they pop off. Then when you attach the radio reciever they roll down. The vents are not made to support the weight of the radio. They're not even worth the time and expense to return. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
4,Church education,"Maria Harris' book Fashion Me A People was a very insightful read for me. I particularly enjoyed the second section of the book, where she mentioned the five different curriculums used within the church. The five curriculums are as follows: Koinonia, which is Community, Leiturgia, which is Prayer, Didache, which is Teaching, Kerygma, which is Proclamation, and Diakonia, which is Service. I also liked how Harris really pushed the idea that learning and education in the church is a long-term commitment and not just present. In other words, the people of the church will always be learning."
3,"Not bad, but there are better","Having bought both the Rath and Strong 6 sigma pocket guide and the GOAL QPC 6 sigma pocket guide, I feel that the GOAL QPC is superior."
4,The basic book,With this book you can take yourself through a six sigma project.With a ground education and this book at your pocket you will be fullfilled green belt.
2,Not bad if you are an expert at Six Sigma,"Just went through the book. It looks like it would be a good reference guide to have but it didn't help me understand six sigma. Just a little too technical for me. I don't want to be an expert, and don't have time to try to become one, I just wanted to understand what people were talking about when they said six sigma. Once our company has done six sigma for a few years and everyone knows what it is, it may be helpful."
2,Boring,"It was to long and did not live up to its reputation, was extremely disappointed. I felt the characters were under-developed."
3,Night of the Blood Beast,"This movie is rarely seen, unfortunately, because it's a nostalgia item. The music, by the way, is the same as the old Rocky Jones, Space Ranger show. One of the weirdest-looking monsters ever seen. It's camp. It's fun."
1,For kids or not?,"Sony must have thought people wouild buy any original platformer property to arrive on the completely non-original gaming console of the PSP. They were right. I bought it for that reason. This game is aweful. Terrible camera, Dumb premise, non-fun action, monotonous gameplay. Memo to Sony: Quit rushing games out the door. Take your time and put out at least an average game.Bottom Line: Is it fun? If you like hacking and slashing in the most monotonous way possible. Will you keep it? Ebayed already. Is it for kids? Nope. Too hard of controls and tons of gore."
3,Would have been great if you could save your progress,"I am not as harsh as some people are about this game. I loved the gameplay and found the underlying story line quite original. What takes away from this game is the inability to save progress. That does not become immediately apparent until you almost get through a particularly trying level, save your game before you run into the boss, end up being killed and thinking you can pick up where you saved last. WRONG! You must play the entire level over again, even if the game has prompted you to save your progress. Also, I did find some of the camera glitches annoying but not fatal. My advice: get this game used; don't pay full price. But buy it if you find this genre fun."
2,Title,"It's a little too hard and what's worse is that you can't save your progress during levels. You get 4 continues and you need to pass the whole level from start to finish with those 4 or it's game over and you start the level from the begining. Of course this gets frustrating. The biggest fault in the gameplay is the camera. Sometimes you need to be messing with the camera to get the right angle so you can jump onto a platform without falling into lava, but it's impossible to get a good camera view. Using your Grim Reaper knife to jump from hook to hook is also a nightmare.The best way I found to attack most levels was to move foward slowly and shoot at enemies from a far. Overall it's not a bad game and some could actually find it more challanging than frustrating. Nothing like the thrill of old days when you came down to your final life and you had to come through or all your work was for nothing. I recommend you try it but it could of been better."
3,what could have been great,instead seems uninspired in parts. if these ladies had kept it together instead of doing this whole thing this band would have been amazing. Too bad people have personalities and stuff that interfere with what's important.
4,Love This Disc!,"I love this disc and it just keeps getting better with repeated listenings. I am absolutely hooked on the lush harmonies of ""Stealing Rosemary"", the mesmerizing ""Single By Choice"", the pure pop perfection of ""Here Right Now"" and the rocking ""Between The Two"", to name just a few. A disc filled with well written songs that are beautifully executed. An absolute pleasure to listen to!"
3,TV on my iMac - Great Success!,"The elegato iMac works reasonably well. I am running it on an iMac iSight 20"" (Pre-Intel) and it performs great unless the processor is tied up with intensive tasks like burning CDs. Even then, the video pauses are very slight. I was a little disappointed with the quality of the recordings. On my 42"" plasma the compression is obvious, but tolerable.I was hoping this would do in place of a DVD-R hooked up to my TV and cable box, but the quality isn't quite there yet. Still, nice product and I don't regret the purchase."
2,Informational not Instructional,"I enjoyed the history section, but as an instructional belly dance program, this DVD is lacking. The instructor describes the movements and shows you, but there's no repetitions or practice. If you're looking for information, this isn't a bad DVD, but if you're looking to really learn belly dance, there are tons of better quality DVD's out there."
2,Choose a different DVD,"History segment is decent. Instructions are too brief. If you're a beginner, not enough time is spent on each movement. If you're more advanced, you already know this stuff. Claims to show how to create a ""Showcase Performance."" Instead, it just shows random clips of two different ""dances."" No hints, suggestions, or even voice cues are given for creating a dance. Also, the random clips (""dances"") include moves that are not included at all in the instruction segment. If one is very new to bellydance, she will have no idea what is being included in the ""dances."" Spend your money on something else."
3,Good reference book,"Nice book to have on workshop for quick reference, even the spiral helps to keep it open while you work. Should have more size and proportions on joints."
4,Great exercise,"The DVD is a great way to work on perfecting your pilates technique! It is pretty intense, but very easy to follow."
3,Mediocre at best,"Each segment is very slow-paced and not very challenging. Even for an overweight, out-of-shape, beginner, I did all of the exercises without difficulty and never broke a sweat.But since I bought the video, I added 2.5lb hand weights to the arms section and did extra reps while waiting for Mari to finish talking and start instructing. Otherwise, you get 5 minutes of pilates for every 10 minutes of video.The 10 Minute Solution videos are by far a better choice."
2,Detailed but dry history,"I ordered this book after reading ""Beloved and God"" which discusses Hadrian's relationship with Antinous...that book was great, but this one was very dry.If you simply want facts about Hadrian's reign, this book should work for you. But History need not be a dry subject, and this book renders a rather remarkable life just that.I'd keep looking if I were you."
5,An all-time favorite,"Before Star Trek:TNG introduced the ""Holodeck,"" there was Dream Park... which I got accidentally from the Science Fiction Book Club, forgot to send back, paid for angrily, and then read over, over, and over again. If you are wondering where our entertainment world of Xbox/Playstation/GameCube, Warcraft/Everquest/Quake, TheSimsOnline and ""LAN parties"" is headed, read Dream Park. It's clever, exciting, and has influenced the thinking of lots of us. Right up there with ""Snow Crash"" in terms of resonance with the world we live in now. Snap it up if you can find it, or write the publisher and request a reissue!"
5,Comcast + VoIP + HBB1 = Bliss,"I've had issues with my VoIP voice quality while simutaneously sending email attachments or doing an FTP upload. I'd get all digital so I'm told. So I thought I'd give this Hawking unit a shot. Let me tell you it just flat out works. Plug and play, small unit fits comfortably atop my belkin router, they even give you a four-inch electrical extenstion cord just in case thier tiny brick doesn't fit comfortably onto your power strip. Now that's thoughtful. I highly recommend this product. I doubt you'll be disappointed. Say goodbye to the tin can."
1,Do not use with Femtocell (AT&T MicroCell),"From the other reviews I've seen (and bought based on), I'm sure this works for the average home/office situation. Unfortunately, I need to use an AT&T MicroCell on my internet connection (a form of VOIP as I understand) to correct the horrible 3G service I already pay AT&T for. As the MicroCell is a new product & the HBB1 is a few years old (2006?), it's not surprising that it does not accommodate the MicroCell kindly... In short, while everything else on my network seemed to run well, the MicroCell would not & since that's my business line, it is useless to me. Luckily, this was a low-cost option, so I'm only out about $30 for trying. Good luck & be warned."
4,Product is no longer supported by Hawking,"This product may work just fine, I haven't had it installed long enough to ascertain yet.However, I just called Hawking Technical Support to ask a general question about this device and they told me they no longer support it, as they no longer manufacture it. They told me they haven't supported this device for over a year.So, buyer beware, there is NO free tech support from Hawking if you buy this product and have a problem with it."
4,Improvements when using multiple computers or applications,"I have seen some improvements, but not the maximum 400% quoted. For example, VoIP quality is maintained, even while uploading or downloading files (before, VoIP would really suffer when sending out large email attachments for example).The same goes for gaming, latency stays low even while doing file transfers. Don't expect it to do miracles, but especially when you have a network with several computers or you are using several applications at the same time (e.g. VoIP, gaming and file transfers), it will make things run a lot more smoothly than before."
1,Does not work right out of the box!!!,"I have over 10 years of network experience and after doing some research and reading some reviews I decided to purchase the HBB1 device. What a let-down! Plugged it in as per the instructions and had NO internet connectivity on my network. Spend more than 2 hours checking everyhting on my network and could not get it to work.... The moment I would bypass this device, all internet connectivity worked. Bottom-line, this little device device does not do what it is supposed to do out of the box!"
4,Salsa Film history,"GREAT SOUNTRACK FROM THE MOVIE . THIS CD RECOUNTS THE IMPACT THAT SALSA MUSIC HAD AT THE BEGGINING OF THE 70'S.PLAYERS INCLUDE: RAY BARRETO,LARRY HARLOW, WILLIE COLON, EL GRAN COMBO, CHEO FELICIANO,HECTOR LAVOE, ISMAEL MIRANDA. ALSO, APPEARANCES BY CARMEN MIRANDA (SINGING COPACABANA), DESI ARNAZ(BABALU), DOLORES DEL RIO (MUCHACHA). SONGS INCLUDE:EL RATON, JULIA, MI DEVILIDAD,MI GENTE, DRUM STORY, SLAVE SHIP, AND MANY MORE."
3,80's Timepiece,"Not even Annie Lennox making a cover hit out of ""No More I Love You's"" could keep this album out of the ""Shame It's Out-of-Print"" File. Comprised of David Freeman and Joseph Hughes and produced by 80's and 90's alt maestro Jimmy Iovine, The Lover Speaks put out this album in 1986, toured briefly with the Eurythmics, then broke up after their sophomore effort was canned by their label. This is saccharine in spots, and the almost omnipresent high-pitched female backing vocalist gets a bit old, but there are some gloriously melodic moments, especially on ""This Can't Go On!"" It's a bit of an 80's time capsule, so if you enjoyed the poppier artists off the beaten path in that era, The Lover Speaks is worth picking up."
1,Pick-up_rake,"First the rake came incomplete. Then when I received the missing partthe screw was not included and I had to scrounge to find the right screw.After I finally got it together I found it was too short. I tried tocall Customer Service, left a message but never received a reply. I am5'10"" and I had to bend to use it. The leaves I tried to pick up were wetand the rake wasn't sturdy enough to hold them all together."
5,sons room,"these stickers worked great, and the price was even better, you definitely can not find these this cheap ANYWHERE ELSE, and they look great up on the wall, and stick very well, thanks"
4,Great for PC users but.....for Mac???? Choose a Canon.,"All the characteristics of this camera are great. The still digitals to mpegs, but I had to buy a Canon for this particular camera to be compatible with my G4 Mac. I bought the camera before I bought my G4."
2,Just ok.,This book was just ok. No real details and story was a bit bland. Needed more suspense and thrilling details. Took me for ever to read couldn't stay interested.
3,Warm,This book warmed me. A sweet read for someone who loves characters who grow to love one another. A book of faith and friendship.
1,somethings wrong,I never bought this book I don't know why it is showing up. Hope you did not charge me for this please check your records.
4,A Hearth in Candlewood,I enjoyed the story. I am a fan of historical fiction and the canal scenes created quite a visual.I recommend it.
5,A Hearth in Candlewood,"Wonderful imagery, Delia Parr is another one of my new favorite authors. I've gotten the rest of the trilogy from my local library and look forward to hours of reading enjoyment. Thanks for sharing."
2,A pain in the rear,It is not easy to use to many buttons to push just to make a slice of toast. It takes a long time to heat up. Temp is far from on the money. I really can't wait until it breaks so I can go to another model.
3,"Good price, decent almonds","10 lbs is a lot, and they are natural. Both positives.They seemed to be a little older than I had hoped. Not as fresh as some I have gotten in the past. I got these predominantly for making almond butter. I like the natural because you get to roast them yourself in the oven. Overall they were good. I have definitely gotten better over the years!"
1,A Horrible Waste of Time and Money,"This is another example of a horrible waste of time and money. Our Emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair. And that brings around another problem -- Emjoi customer service and repair service. You'll want to avoid both. Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache.Not only are Emjoi products cheap, they are painful to use."
1,worthless,"Do not waste your money on this product, has absolutely no power. The return process is confusing and intricate. Two days to see if I qualify for a refund on a product I tried for 5 minutes and instantly hated?! I will NEVER deal with this seller again."
2,Save your money... Part II,Same comment as another reviewer... 95% of the info is in the game manual.
4,It was very good,The book had some info that was in the manuel. But I really like the story in the back
1,Poor quality video,This video is well below Amazon's usual quality. The audio is also poor. Not worth the money. It is the only DVD that I have purchased from Amazon that I was not satisfied with.
3,USB connection total garbage,whoefully disapointed with the quality of the video coming from the usb connection. the analogue outs are much much better. so here we have a situation where the analogue is better than the digital out.plan on buying a video capture card in order to get decent video to your pc.
3,"Nice book, not for the beginner","This is a very nice and colorful guide, but I would not recommend it for the beginner. It does not go into detail about how to find the center point of the egg, nor how to divide the egg evenly. It has many color photos of beautiful eggs, but there is a lot of white space that could be used to show the reader how to develop the design and in what dye order to use for the best results. This book is a great supplement, but beginners should look elsewhere."
1,Not good,"Although it was mentioned beforehand that this book had a few little flaws, the pages came apart. I was very disappointed."
4,Photoshop Elements For Dummies,Overall a really good book for learning Photoshop Elements. I was ready to switch to a more user friendly program but this book helped me get started. I would've liked to have had more color examples but it still gave good information on many topics. I will read it again now that I have some basic knowledge to really get into the more complex options available with this program.
3,A MASTERPIECE (it still sounds good after 30 years),"This album is simply a masterpiece. Along with ""Cosa Nuestra"" and ""LoMato"" are Willie's & Hector's best work. All tracks are good. Sadly that Hector is not alive, because a reunion would have been great. To all you salsa afficionados, this is what Salsa supposed to sound like."
5,Excellent overviews and great sample questions,"The chapters were well divided and easy to understand. In another arch book I purchased, the author tried to amuse you with stories and impress you will his large vocabulary. This book gives a quick real world reference at the beginning of each chapter and then gets right to the details you need to know in a plain and clear manner. The sample test on the CD was great. It allows the user to take the test in sections, allowing you to focus on problem areas. I passed the test on the first try after reading this book."
2,Hot DeLonghi,"For all its jazzy appearance and one nice little feature (the bump-out at the back to allow for a round pizza), the product does not really deserve the extra price over simpler products. The operating principles of the ""controls"" are still stone-age and require nothing but experience to guide you. The biggest complaint, however, is that the device gets so HOT on the outside, no doubt due to skimping on the thermal insulation."
3,Loved but died after 1.5 years,"We loved our Delonghi and although it was big for a small kitchen it worked great for pizzas, cookies, toast and bagel bites. Cooked perfectly with no burning on top. Also we loved that we could ""bake"" on a hot day without heating the house with the full size oven. Sadly one day it just stopped working. We thought a fuse had blown for the outlet as there was no warning. I am trying out another brand but miss the light which it had when it opened, tray popping out when you open door, the not burning so am thinking of trying again despite the early demise."
1,Oven quit after 12 months,"The machine quit inexplicably after 1 year. No warning. No reason. Also, the control knobs for settings cannot be read without glasses or a magnifying glass."
1,Doesn't work,"The on/off dial did not work. Could not get it to stay on and toast. Also, there is not timer on it so that's a problem. I am returning and buying something else!"
1,another oven timer issue,"I have used my toaster oven for maybe 3 years, usually about once weekly. Definitely not getting heavy usage. But last week I noticed that the toast was badly burned, and when looking closer, the knob was turned to the left for the clicking timer for toast, but when the timer dinged, it usually turned off. This time the timer kept going and turned the knob to the right, which is the continuous cook option. It will burn everything if you don't stay right there with it. I am throwing mine away- it is too dangerous with this fire hazard.It's a shame there are no repair options, but this is the last time I will buy this brand."
2,Don't waste your time or money on this game,"This game is fairly good for being an original Xbox game but if you play it on your Xbox 360 it will freeze so many times that you will probably stop playing it like how I stopped. My advice is just to stick with the new games that come out and forget about the past ""Platinum Hits."""
4,Frustrating fun!,"BLACK's graphics are top notch, and the gun play is strikingly realistic with shock and awe sound.However, as addicted as I am to the gameplay, you cannot save until you reach points that take obscenely long to get to. I've had to replay many segments, many times to get to a save point and this is NOT fun. Also, you cannot skip past the pointless inbetween cinematics which also wastes time.However, this game looks like a 360 release and I'm willing to slog through the annoyances I mentioned above because BLACK is so damn fun!"
4,"Not bad, but bad enough to be good!","Fans of ""Vampirella"" magazine and ""Hammer"" films will apreciate this gem. It is a little like ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" (the same guy is playing Dracula)in it's lighthearted comedic approach to a tale of an American actress whom inherits a castle in Transylvania that is still occupied by her undead/unclothed grandmother.I loved it!-Dave Grant"
5,"Fun, very stylish. Easy to assemble.","I just got this as a christmas present, It's simple marvelous and it has only like 69 pieces. Like the average lego, also includes with very detailed instructions to follow. I am a robot-mecha type fan!.This one I have on my desk at work. I love to stare it."
5,Fantastic series!,"My four year old son is in love with this chapter series! A friend suggested it to us since he seemed ready for a more advanced reading material at bedtime. My husband reads him a chapter every night...sometimes more because they don't want to stop. It's become a great tradition for them, and something they both look forward to. We love that there are so many in the collection! Start with number 1 and just continue. :)"
3,Books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like this book because it is a book!!!!!!! I love all kinds of books. Picture books, chapter books, and so on. Please write more books!!! I will read them all!!!!!"
5,THESE ARE SONGS ON A SANTO @ JOHNNY CD !,"These are not samples or tracks available on Gene @ Eunice's cd. Instead, these are tracks from Santo and Johnny's Best of The Rest cd. Just thought I'd make you aware."
2,NOT for Early Miscarriage,"The book's title is misleading. I don't feel ""Miscarriage"" should be included in the title as there really is a big difference between miscarrying at 10 weeks vs still birth or infant death. This book is mainly addressed to woman who've experienced a very late loss, stillbirth or infant death."
3,Pretty Good Book,I read this book right after I gave birth to a baby at 22 weeks pregnant. I had an incompetant cervix. I thought the book was good in that it spoke a lot to emotions etc. however I was hoping for more information about cerclage and effectiveness of it and typically what happens etc.
3,Better for those who lost a child after birth.,"I dont want to say this is a horrible book because that would truely be unfair, but I misscarried due to an ectopic pregnancy. I felt this book was geared more towards parents that lost a child AFTER carring to term and delivering. I think that is apparent in the reviews too. Don't get me wrong, she does touch on miscarriages and causes and she is very positive and straight forwad. Like my title implies though, it was not what I was looking for."
5,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?,"It is impossible to say that MOZART AND LEADBELLY is Ernest J. Gaines' best book. There is no sensible way to distinguish greatest from its source. Pick up A LESSON BEFORE DYING or any of the few but vivid and vital books written by Ernest J. Gaines. He is a writer with deep roots.He writes about what is real, true and what will get us all eventually. His version of fiction is rich with history, maybe personal history, but certainly cultural history. His characters are people we know, cut out of his and our experience.Don't wait to read Ernest J. Gaines. MOZART AND LEADBELLY, his most recent book, is a good place to start. A few good stories and a few personal essays, then go back down the trail of brilliant novels. Try, IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE. If that doesn't move you, check to see if you have a pulse. Enough said. If you can read and listen to the words, you won't be disappointed, especially if you would rather listen to Leadbelly instead of Mozart."
4,Great for fans of the T.V show,"I got this game for my 4 year old for christmas. She loves the T.V. program and learning about animals, so I figured it would be a hit with her, and it was. She loves playing it and trying to find all the puzzle pieces to find the treasure. Kids learn about some animals and their habitatis, numbers and patterns. You have to look for hidden treasure and there are 3 levels of play on the games. My daughter loved it first off simply because it contains the whole Zoboomafoo theme song! She runs it on her iMac. Only one little problem, it occasionally locks up when left unattended for a pretty long period of time, and the game is left running."
5,Sill fresh after 30 years,"I've been listening to this masterpiece for the last 30 years, and it is still sounding fresh and revealing new dimensions. While other reviews make reference to it being a great Salsa album, I look at it as a work that transcedent Salsa, and it becomes a tribute to the origin of the genders of the different cuts, being Guaguanco, Cha-cha-cha, or Son. You can never listen to just one track, even if you only try to play the last track, Indestructible, as soon as it is over, you end up starting from the top and listening to the entire CD. A work of art, one of the best recordings made outside of Cuba that represents the Afrocuban music of the 20th Century."
4,Only problem is the price,"I ordered this text for college students who want to become teachers, but it would be equally applicable to my freshman ""English class"" students. The cross-cultural and multi-generational excerpts provide the opportunity to sample sociological, historical, philosophical, and psychological writings. Economics is included. Frederick Douglass and Claude Brown provide input from the African-American community. Bell Kaufman and Sylvia Ashton-Warner explore their experiences with students from backgrounds unlike their own. Tom Lehrer and Russell Baker provide insight from a lighter, humorous standpoint. I am looking forward to using this book."
5,Best Point and Shoot for the Price,"I've used this camera in some of the worst conditions you can imagine. Being deployed to Iraq, I've used this in 20 Degree to 130 Degree heat, sandstorms, being banged around, etc.I have no major complaints about this camera at all, it's very good, and the pictures come out crystal clear. Even the movies come out clear, which is suprising for a P&S; Camera.Only flaws I noticed about the camera, is it sucks for shaky hands and vibrations. For instance, in a gun-truck going down the road, or if your hands are shakey. Also, the flash causes red-eye alot, but you can touch it up in photoshop."
4,HOW CAN A CAMERA THIS SMALL BE THIS GOOD,"I have had this camera for years. Ever since I bought this camera, I have routinely been complimented on my photos. When I look at the new Canon cameras and compare the technology and the price of these new cameras I am amazed. Obviously, I know we need to go forward and I am looking at the Canon SD880. If I could go backward, I would buy the same Canon SD20 that has accompanied me in my pocket for years. I am never without my camera as long as I have a pocket. I am still amazed at all of the features that you can take advantage of with the SD20."
3,Better of with Better Face Paints,"I recommend buying professional face paints that are much easier to use. Sites like www.jestpaint.com sell paints that will go on a lot easier, and still last. They have Diamond FX paints, which I think are amazing, that is why I sell them. :)"
3,Serves its purpose.,"I'm just irritated that it claims to come with a sheet of tattoos, well my kit didn't. The sponge SUCKS. It says to wet it only a tiny bit or the paint will streak... yeah, the paint will streak no matter how much water gets onto that sponge.Aside from those issues it was an okay purchase. When the colors are applied with the brush they are very vibrant. Just don't expect to walk around all day wearing your art, it flakes off fairly quickly."
3,"Very complex, needs more instruction for architectural.","The install was easy. The program is VERY different from Autocad, which makes it harder if that's what you've worked with in the past. It looks like the program has a lot of potential, but it would be extremely helpful if Turbocad would break down Architectural, machine design, and other uses with mini-tutorials that would help you get started! Most designers (we're architectural/engineering)don't have time to get involved with a program and learn it from scratch.Brandt JunkerAnodyne Services"
2,Dusty,How are you supposed to purchase a product blind. This product gives no information as to what is actually in their product. I wont purchase something without knowing what the ingredients are.
5,Works for me.,"Installed on an F250, no problems. Not sure what else to say. I haven't put a heavy load on it but it should be OK."
1,Misleading title and picture!,"Title says ""Zippo Flint Cards (6 Flints per Card, Pack of 24)"" I received one flint card! Not a pack of 24. They should rename the title to ""One flint card (6 flints per card)"" and take down the picture of the 24 pack of flint cards. I uploaded a picture of what I received in the mail. Hopefully this will better enlighten others when purchasing this product. ."
4,Decent,The book shipped and arrived quickly but was a little more beat up than described in the book descriptions. Overall it was decent but I felt a little misled.
2,Not a good reference,"I was quite disappointed in this book. It does equip you with useful tools for solving probability problems, although the organization at times leaves something to be desired. My primary complaint is that it has no value whatsoever as a reference. In practice, I often just want to know the functional form of a certain probability distribution; this book will describe methods to derive it, but you won't find the formula anywhere."
5,Great Product!,I have a coconut allergy and it is near impossible to find shampoo and conditioner without it in it and I use this with the shampoo and it leaves my hair soft and clean! I have always loved this product and I will continue to buy it.
2,I wouldn't guess this is Jarre's album,"True, I wouldn't every think he will do an album like that. Just not a single harmony that would show it's the album made by early electro/ambient mastermind. I'm not saying it's really worthless, there are couple tracks with catchy melodies, but some of his tricks are so cheap, like sampling an ecstatic woman or calling a track ""Fresh News"" appealing for FM radios to use it.However, it's not the point. I don't think think this is a good strong album. You can disagree with me whatever you like, but I'm a fan of the mastermind for many many years and I hope my opinion deserves some a voice here."
4,TEO & TEA,"Why the hell would any artist worthy of the title ""Artist/Composer"" want to keep making new music that sounds like what he did 40 years ago? People have some strange ideas about creativity. Jarre is one of the great composers of our age. If he wants to play around in the pop idiom, he's more than earned the right. This album, TEO & TEA, doesn't ""flow"" like some of his earlier albums but I don't think that was ever the intention. It's a good change of pace from what you'd normally expect from Jarre... to be fair, perhaps this doesn't contain his most memorable work but I find it works just fine for what it is."
5,Inspirational,"Inspirational, motivational, electric. Good pick up music. If you are looking for something that gets you moving, this is a piece by Jean that you will enjoy."
3,"Well done, but overly mannered.","The singing is excellent, and some of the pieces are quite good, but after a while you get tired of this genre."
5,Awesome,"This is a triumphant return for Gove, and a GREAT album. That warm and rich voice, good and great lyrics, and excellent instrumental accompaniment. Certainly for the fans of Shady Gove and Coconut Gove, and for a much broader range of musical tastes as well."
3,Preacher; not Mr. Preacher,"Johnstone provides plenty of action in this story. I really enjoy reading about the lives of people who traveled through and helped settle the Western U.S. and the Rocky Mountains. Preacher, not Mr. Preacher always defends the good, both in the white man and in the Indian, but never backs down from a battle with the evil in mankind. Even though he does not ""cotton"" to the pilgrims that travel in the wagons, he does help them again in this story. He is also trying to prevent an Indian War that white men are trying to start. There is plenty of action here and even some romance that you have to read to believe. Take a ride out West in the mid 1800's; you'll enjoy it."
5,Johnny Mathis Gold is pure gold.,It's not Christmas until you a hearing Johnny Mathis singing Sleigh Ride. No body has ever done it better. A great singer with a great voice singing to great arrangements is hard to beat. The whole albums sounds like it was just recorded. Friends and family always enjoy this wonder collection. A half century of Johnny Mathis recording Christmas songs says it all!
5,Couldn't be better,It's the perfect Christmas album. It's a nice mixture of religious and traditional songs. No matter what your taste is you'll love it.
2,So far so good.,"Replaced a broken standard antenna. This one is supposed to have better reception, but I cannot tell the difference.The magnet is significantly weaker than the standard antenna, and it is about twice the height. You may hear wind whistling above your head.The only plus is that the wire cover is very flexible and the gluetape they used contoured to my roof way better than the standard antenna."
5,WOW!,"My brother-in-law introduced us to Chuck Brodsky with this album. Since then we've purchased his two other albums and we were so excited about this young folksinger, that we travelled 300 miles for a moving coffeehouse performance. ""Radio"" (and for that matter the earlier ""Letters in the Dirt"") is a charming ""first time listen"", but we found ourselves replaying each song in order to understand each word and fully appreciate his wonderful poety. Chuck has an uncanny ability to make his characters and stories come to life. It is hard not to be touched. ""Radio"" get's my album-of-the-year-award!"
3,Ok game...,"This is a well scripted game. It plays like a movie. There are puzzles that will stop you and you have to figure them out before you can progress. There are funny jokes, and some running jokes from the previous games that I didn't really get, since I never played them.Negatives on this game is I can't do a full or partial install, I can only play it off the CD. Of course it is one of those linear adventure games, so if you can't think of the exact thing to do, and you're stumped for long periods of time, it can get frustrating."
5,Tasty pedal steel and pedal dobro,"This is a fine country pedal steel album, well played and well mixed. Peggy Green's playing is every bit as good as her choice of material. She seems to be as comfortable playing country on the C6th as she is on E9th - several tunes were half over before I realized she was on the back neck. My favorite cut, though, is her novel Pedabro arrangement of Tears in Heaven. Songs are:Tips of My FingersI Can't Make You Love MeMissouri BreakHeartacheAlibisI Can't SleepStanding Knee Deep in a RiverTears in HeavenBoot Scootin BoogieSeminole WindOld CountrySimple Gifts"
2,Font Far Too Small,"This book in over-sized, but the pages have 3-inch margins on all sides and the text is eight-point-font or smaller. It is very difficult to read."
1,one dimensional socialist propaganda,"I actually like a couple of sinclair lewis novels but this is unabashed socialist propaganda. Instead of focusing on sanitary conditions in meatpacking industry which is the real utility of this book, it's the evil capitalists against the hardworking devoted working man. Never mind that socialism ruined many lives in its wake, Lewis died wanting the same kind of utopia the USSR exposed many unfortunate countries to."
2,Julie / Millicent and Therese / Amelia,"Okay, so, my mom and I are walking through Blockbuster, and we see this movie, and she''s like, """"Watch this."""" As it turns out, she and her cronies first watched this movie in college when it premiered on TV and had to turn it off cuz it was too scary. So I get home and go upstairs to watch it, expecting to be really scared, cuz my mom''s a pretty brave gal. Boy, was I wrong! This movie wasn''t scary, it was just whacked!!! I found myself laughing out loud when the little Voodoo Guy was attacking Karen Black. Is it just me, or does he sound like Donald Duck at times? So to wrap things up, I would recommend you rent TRILOGY OF TERROR if there is nothing else in...."
5,Trilogy of Terror,The movie is great and its three short stories on one DVD. Which are all played by Karen Black great actress a must see. It's really not scary but entertaining.
4,"3 times the horror, 3 times the fun",This is a great little made for TV horror film. All I will say about the voodoo doll that appears in the third story is that it makes Chucky look like a wimp.
1,The one and only terror.,"I believe Leonard Maltin must have watched ""Trilogy of Terror"" on videotape at full speed scan in order to craft his review. Albeit two out of three terrors would have a hard time spooking the cat, the Karen Black segment will make even an experienced (read, jaded) horror aficionado squirm in his or her seat. Karen's performance carries the whole load here and makes this little made for TV anthology worth the price of admission...no kidding."
1,Johnny Mathis 50 Anniversary CD,"I ordered two copies of the same title. My copy had various skips, especially in the first three songs. I no longer listen to it because it is annoying and I don't have the receipt to return it. The other copy was a gift, and the recipient has not indicated that it is also defective, but perhaps would not in any case."
4,Pure Experimental Music,This are only a sketches for the album 'This Sentence Is True(the previous sentence is false)'. This album is very rare and it's ONLY for people who really love Chandra's music.
1,What a disappointment,"The cover looks exciting enough, and the blurb is okay, but when I acually read the book, I found I couldn't finish it because it was too boring and the plot was too predictable. This book's plot was weak, and the book was confusing-it switched back and forth between the game and the real world. All in all, a terrible book that belongs in the trash."
4,"It's Love Battery,,Can You Feel the Love Buzz??","Greetings to all alternative grunge listeners out there..Grunge is not Dead..The seattle sound has left its mark on music..Bands like Nirvana, Mudhoney , Soundgarden have always topped the charts,,but here comes the Best Underground Band I've heard in a while,,Its Love Battery, and the album Confusion AU gogo..It's Sweet,,with good lyrics and melodic tunes..Grunge BABY..Colorblind is the best ever..This band reminds me of Nirvana and KUrt Cobain,,simply pure and Vigorous in Sound,,I give this CD a four star,, YOU""VE GOT TO GET IT...IT ROCKS.."
5,Love Battery continues with its incredible psychedelic rock,"Love Battery, a band that slipped through the cracks of the hype of the Pacific Northwest earlier this decade still survive. Perhaps causing them to continue to develop without ever collapsing under the weight of other bands and their overwhelming successes. Confusion Au Go Go, their fifth disc, is extremely solid all the way through. Like their previous, and best disc, Straight Freak Ticket, Love Battery musically blend psychodelic twisting slide guitar, with off-kilter rock beats. There is always something interesting and unusual about Ron Nine's lyrics and voice. The best songs are the title track, Monkey Brain and Hollow Body. Highly recommended."
2,Oh Melissa... Where Did You Go?,"Let me start by saying that I have always been a huge, devoted fan of Melissa since day one back in the mid 80's. But one of the things I always loved was about her material was the intense, passionate lyrics & accoustic 12 string sound. This CD is lacking in both of these areas. Lyrics like ""I thought that I was dead so I called you from my bed"" and ""well I have lived 10 years plus 10 and 10 and 10 again"" were very disappointing to me from the same woman who wrote great tunes like ""Bring Me Some Water"" and ""Like The Way I Do"". However ""Breathe"", ""Lucky"", ""Will You Still Love Me"" and ""When You Find The One"" on this album are good tunes and more the style of Melissa we known and love. Ditch that drum machine Melissa we love you without it. Can someone please tell me what the heck that is they're saying throughout ""Tuesday Morning""?!"
5,From a HUGE Melissa fan-this is one of the best!,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this CD and it did not disappoint. It has a very different tone and feel to it then her previous material. Historically, Melissa's lyrics/music were always based on being hurt and angry. So, I was sceptical when I heard she would be releasing an album about being happily in love. But, her voice is strong, the lyrics powerful and it is all classic Melissa. She ended ""Skin"" on an up note and continues with ""Lucky"". I highly recommend it!!!"
3,Well...,"First impression was disappoinment, but if you are tired when you listen...few days after I started to like few songs, but still I think there are few boring songs and one awful one. I love Mercy song, I like Would you still love me and Secret agent. Tuesday is quite nice. By the way do you recognice similar with Mercy song's beginning and Sarah MacLachlan's Fumbling song? (I hope I remember song right but Sarah is singer!) Meet me in the dark is absolutely fantastic song. But Lucky and Breathe are already so used, not enough suprises I think. As a whole cd I think Skin was better, but of course even I like to hear happier song sometimes and I really admire Melissa Etheridge and try to see her live if she come to Europe, it's a long way to USA...."
2,In pain,"I'm one of those who grew up with the sounds of Melissa Etheridge, walked round the park holding hands with my girlfriend to the sounds of 'come to my window', and bought every album from the Debut right up to Skin. This is probably the last time I will buy a Melissa Etheridge album. It seems I've grown up, but Melissa is still a teen, with lyrics like 'I'm alright...it only hurts when I breathe'. A great first love, but one which is best remembered fondly, and not pursued. This album was not for me - as a Melissa Etheridge fan, I'm dissapointed."
3,An Average Game.,"Don't expect to have a whole lot of fun with this game. The gameplay is relatively easy with some points of frustration. The graphics a so-so and flight control is simply. Sometimes the vehicles and people look like paper and other times like real things. The controls will sometimes shoot you around and make you crash. Being a short game, you could probably beat this game in a day. It is easy to get the feel. Overall and average game with a fun ending and average storyline."
3,bit too ume to me,"I prefered the seaweed flavor over this cause its too sour to me. since i usually have it in the mornings, it sometimes gives me acid stomach the entire day. but the case may differ on other ppl."
4,Good reference for mantras and puja,"Looking for a nice collection of Buddhist devotional texts? This is a good one. With the Tiratana Vandana, Dhammapalam Gatha, Prajnaparamita Hrdaya Sutra, various mantras (including Vajrasattva 100 syllable) and the Heart Sutra. As well as the sevenfold and threefold pujas as practiced by the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. Good stuff."
3,It's okay,I love the author and most of her books. I felt their was too much of a gab in the story. In the last book the family had adopted one child. All of a sudden I am reading about their grown children. I would have like more continuity between book four and five. I would have like to have read more about the kids and developed a relationship with the adopted children and their experiences before jumping into their adult lives. But still a good read.
5,you can't put it down,"This is a wonderful book. Once you get started you can't put it down! If you have not read the other books on the Delany family, don't worry for Ms. Oke catches you up on where they have been to the present storyline. The way she bring the message of God and his teachings is simply excellent, and she also ties this in to today's society and how easy it is to relate to the characters just like you were there yourself. I hope there is a sequel soon! I love her books and would reccommend them to anyone!"
5,Totally hot& sexy! Just like Jordan!,I Luv Jordan! I Was A Huge NKOTB Fan! Jordan And Joey Were Alwayz My Fav! Now The 2 Put Out Thier CD's And I Have Both Of Them! I Luv U Jordan!!!!! You Are Sooooooooooo Hott! I Mean Like SIZZLING- HOTT!!!!!!!
1,Don't bother with this book!,The fact that there are entire chapters that are completely lifted word for word from Night Of The Living Dead doesn't bother me...much... but the fact that this book is poorly written as a Whole does. The characters we are given are not even developed enough to be called cardboard and the story jumps around aimlessly. The bus wreck in the begining is the only really well thought out part and even that is put on the very back burner. Skip this one if you can!
4,Interesting,"This book was born from a screenplay written over 20 years ago and it shows. It reads like a screenplay. This was the originally intended sequel to the cult classic ""Night Of The Living Dead"". 10 years after the so-called ""plague"" was vanquished, a bus topples over in middle america. A Baptist congregation rushes to the scene of the accident(they drive metal spikes through the dead to prevent the plague from reoccuring). Needless to say the plague returns and all hell breaks loose. The last few chapters are a rehash of ""Night"", with our heroes running from house to house. Although the book is never boring it suffers from sequelitis. A far cry from the brillance of Romero's cinematic sequel."
4,Great zombie story,"This book was great to read. At times when I was reading it, I actually got scared. It kinda pulls you into the horrfing world that the characters are in. It was a great zombie story, that in my opinon should be adaped to film the way this story is written!! I highly recommend this book to read."
3,Nice Product but...,"The ""but"" is that the valances were quite small for the windows in my son's room. I had to order twice as many and overlap them. He does love his new room, though."
5,Wished I would have gotten it !!!!! But never did.,I ordered this cd because I have the album. Paid a premium price after much hesitation. $103.00 plus S&H from the-book-community. To date have never recieved product.I think Wings Wild Life is one of Paul's best efforts after the Beatles split-up. Can't go wrong with this album.
2,Painful to read,"This was they type of book that you keep reading hoping it will get better. Maybe it's me but I just didn't like the writing style and found myself rereading paragraphs to try to ""get it"". Save your money. The first hundred or so pages is about her childhood, 50 or so about her drab apartments and the bars she hung out in and the last 25 about intervention.Read the ""Big Book"" (Alcoholics Anonymous literature) and watch Intervention on t.v. and you will have read this book."
5,Ratcheting up your jazz. Master level.,"This is master level study from a 35+ years experience player. If you're looking to feed your mind and tighten up your playing, this informational video is for you. Lots of jazz ideas for those aiming toward mastery. He's a great technical player who encompass many styles with jazz as a pivot point. Personally, based on my advanced beginner level, it was a little of an over-reach. I can come back to it later."
1,Kacynsky's bedtime reading,"I mean doesn't that say it all?For those who don't know this, Al Gore's book was found in the Unabomber's cabin, well read and heavily annotated.Anyone praising this book is obviously a hard-core environmentalist radical.Quotes like, ""the internal combustion engine is the biggest threat to mankind"", are just ""priceless"" in showing how far on the fringe Al Gore really is.In a recent statement he actually maintained that the threats to the environment are a close second to the threats of terrorism.I hope he'll include that sparkling wisdom in a future edition of this book."
5,Very Important Book,"This is a very important book for what Gore has to say about the environment. The environmental problem is mainly caused by the western world's reliance on a consumer lifestyle. Most of our products are causing environmental havoc. A quick look at Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Sudan, and Downtown Los Angeles shows how our need for diamonds and oil has a direct negative impact on the people and environment in those regions. And our need to eat so much meat via the fast food chains are wreaking havoc upon the rainforests. Gore's book is very well-intended, but we need to look at our consumerism and product-based lifestyle in order to discover how our lives effect the environment. I give Gore 5 stars just for caring enough to try to figure this all out and writing this book."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,This book is drivel and propaganda most likely written by a left-wing ghostwriter? Heavy on emotion and light on fact. Al Gore should be ashamed of himself. Anyone buying into this leftist garbage should be required to attend remedial high school science.
1,"Another ""Crisis""","A book filled with allegations of damage to the environment due to the evils of modern industrial civilization. As usual, we are told that there is a scientific consensus that there is a crisis and that the time to act is now, when in reality no consensus exists among scientists for many of the environmental problems cited.For a more balanced view on the state of the environment, I recommend ""The Ultimate Resource 2"" by Julian Simon, or ""The True State of the Plant"" by Ronald Bailey."
1,"This book belongs on the ""B"" Fiction shelf.","The greatest collection of scientific fiction, half truths, exageration, mis-statements and general doom-mongering since Rachel Carson's, Silent Spring. Weakly footnoted and completely unsubstantiated by any references other than to the author's opinion. Apparently American's still have a need to be frightened by Chicken Little and the boogie man. It seems to sell books. Incidently, in the 35 years since Silent Spring was first published, none of Ms. Carson's dreaded predictions of ecological catastrophe have come to pass.I think we can all rest assured that Mr. Gore will be equally as inaccurate an environmental prophet"
1,"Written on emotion, not critical analysis.","I hoped this would have been better written to make the case. It does not stand up to an analysis from the opposing point of view which would and could destroy or weaken the arguments for saving the environment. Better to leave this subject to those professionally involved, and let the politician write the Foreword!"
4,Want to know what he really thinks?,"If you want to know what Al Gore really meant by eliminating the internal combustion engine in 25 years, this book is the answer. Much has been said about Al Gore, and only about half of it is true.The book starts off fast and furious. It will tell you that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, an assessment that is more likely true than false. You will be alarmed by his frank and sometimes extreme views on the destiny of the planet.Then comes the good news. We can do something about it without killing the economy and putting the American people through a lot of pain. He realizes that Americans will never go for draconian measures to save the environment, but will do what is needed if it is made to be worth their while. The replacement of the IC engine is only one of the many ideas he floats, many of which make a lot of sense. I would encourage people to take the good ideas to heart without bashing him over the head for the bad ones."
3,Mediocre,"When I heard ""Single White Female,"" I was really pleased with the song and went right out to buy the CD. The second release ""She Went Out for Cigarettes"" also delivers in the way of quality country music. Some of these songs on this CD also stand up to what pleased me with the initial two, ""The Fire,"" and ""Love That We Lost,"" were also really good. Some of these songs I just didn't like. ""Picket Fences"" and ""Unknown"" were just not as great as I had hoped. If you like Chely, by all means go out and get it, but if you were looking for more of the title track, you may not be as thrilled as you hoped."
1,Disappointing,"There are two songs- ONLY- on this disc. Very disappointed but evidently my fault, I didn't vet it well enough. I felt duped."
5,Chely has a beautiful voice,"Chely's vocals on this CD are so superb!! I bought while on the road and listened to it in the car. I almost fell asleep due to her voice. This CD is highly reccomended (by the way, I wasnt driving!)"
2,"Sorry, but too basic for me","I've given this book a couple of chances, but, I can't TAKE IT ANYMORE!For one, this book is a huge ponderous tome, and he uses a lot of words, and takesa lot of time, tosay one little thing. He has a problem getting to the point.If you are the type of reader who likes light, fluffy, not much to think aboutauthors, this is the book for you.If you are looking for facts to learn, this might be the book for you,if you can put up with the long, drawn out chit chat all through this book."
2,Not a xeriscaping guide,"I bought this book primarily for the plant listing, and am disappointed. After looking through it, I reviewed the title of the book and realized that it is not actually billed as a xeriscaping guide. There are some xeric selections, but lot of these plants grow great in New Mexico only if you water them like crazy. Some of them shouldn't be planted here at all, such as silver maple (browning at the edges of the leaves by the end of July, not just in my yard, but elsewhere in my neighborhood too), and salt cedar (a significant environmental hazard even within the Albuquerque metro area).I liked the first part of this book the best - the general overview of gardening in New Mexico is informative and easy to read. The final section of the book, city-by-city plant guides, is just not very useful to me since I only garden in Albuquerque."
2,Good but not what I wanted,This book is good for one looking for landscape ideas and techniques. I want a Southwest plant identification book. It does that poorly with photos difficult to see closely.
3,Slow going classic is worth a try,"Lots of people remember the Bellairs books from their childhood and still hold them dear. Now that the most popular ones have been reissued and are readily available, the question becomes, ""what about a kid now, reading the books now?"".Well, having just finished re-reading a bunch of Bellairs and later Brad Strickland books, it seems that this title, (or ""The House With A Clock in Its Walls""), is the one to try if you want to test out a Bellairs book on your young reader. It's the introduction of Johnny Dixon, it has an adventurous vibe, and it has the most action. These books are so well-written it's worth a try, but don't be surprised or disappointed if your reader just doesn't warm up to them."
3,Have carried for 3-4 years,"I have carried this for 3 or 4 years and im looking for a replacementThe good things about it:Very easy to open with one hand,almost as fast as a switch blade.Locks up nicely.While I do not use my knives for prying I would feel safe using it to pry,it is put together well.The Bad:It is as sharp as a dull spoon,even after trying to sharpen it several times.The serrations are completely useless after about 2 years of using them,it looks like I tried to cut concrete with them!I would not trust my life to this knife.At $17 it isn't horrible,but I bought it when it was $34 so it wasn't a good deal,I believe im going to get a Kabar Mule to replace this."
3,Does not live up to Gerber brand name: Loose bolts and stiff opening,"I really wanted to like this knife more than I did.Pros:- Blade cuts well, and stays sharp- Blade locks open- Light weightCons:- Opening is not smooth enough, making use with one hand difficult- Handle bolts occasionally loosen- Belt clip is extremely stiffNote: Use a Torx T-6 screwdriver to tighten the handle bolts.Update: One of the handle bolts loosened to the point of falling out, along with the spacer. After another reviewer helpfully suggested contacting Gerber for a replacement, I did, and Gerber responded very quickly with a new bolt and spacer, free of charge. Also, I second his and Gerber's suggestion that any loose bolts be secured with Loctite blue."
3,Handle,I bought this knife and anyone who knows me knows that I put every knife I own to the test. This knife held an edge better than other gerber knives I've owned BUT there is a problem with the handle. If you buy this knife keep a close eye on the screws in the handle. I had to tighten them all the time!! Over time I had to retire the knife because all the screws fell out. The handle had too much play in it and that allowed the screws to come loose and fall out.
3,Not as large as expected,"I bought it to replace my old one, same model. However, when it arrived, it was a little smaller than expected. I found my old one, and when compared, this one might as well be the mini and the mini paraframes they sell should be micros."
2,"Meh. Ok knife, has design flaws.","A good idea, but has several problems. First, where the clip contacts the frame (not at the anchor point) there isnt continuous frame, but just a nub. This keeps catching on fabric when I go to put it back and clip into the pocket, making it a problem that not only has me fumbling to set it, but also wearing the fabric. Second, the frame is providing the tension for the blade to keep it in the folded position, and has already started losing tension. Wish I had saved for a spyderco."
5,Best Carry Knife for the Money,"The knife fits perfectly in my watch pocket of my jeans and weighs so little I almost forget about it.( which is nice if you carry a lot in your pocket; keys,cell phone, smokes,lighter, etc.)The knife is ABSOLUTELY easy to operate with one hand from opening, pulling and closing.The para frame held up well and the half serrated half regular blade was excellent.Go ahead and pay extra for a kershaw or another $60 knife, I'd rather have a tried and true knife that is lightweight, effective, stylish and cost effective enough if I lose it or want to give it to a friend as a gift on the spot, then its cheap enough to replace. I had my last one six years and am only replacing it as I gifted it to a friend who liked it."
4,Very Useful and Reliable Tool,"First of all, I purchased this knife exactly one week from now. It is holding up well and I have no complaints. I bought it at Lowe's for about 20 dollars.Second of all, my handle is holding up and does not loosen.Third of all, I do find it hard to unlock the blade with one hand. That is the reason it dropped a star. I would like to be able to open and close it with one hand. Opening the blade is perfect.OVERALL: Great knife! I would recommend it to any person new to using knives and those who want a dependable knife for around-the-house use. I'm pretty sure those who have enough knowledge of survival would be able to use it as a last-resort survival knife."
1,Misleading label for the bulb,Feit Electric ESL30T 30-Watt Compact Fluorescent High Wattage Bulb (125-Watt Incandescent Equivalent)This bulb cannot be a true ESL bulb as ESL (Electron Stimulated Luminescence) technology is different from that of compact fluorescent. [...]ESL bulbs contain NO mercury. Compact fluorescent contain mercury.I have no intention of purchasing this bulb or any bulb being sold by the same company (Felt Electric) [...] because of this misnaming.An explanation of the different types of lighting bulbs.[...]
3,"Not his finest, but it's all there...","Quiry and observationist lyrics over beautiful melodies, though, sadly on this CD there is no 'stand out' track. Even reapeated listeing doesn't reveal a hint of a spark of the earlier magic - and after listening a few times you'll want to give up. As a CD for your G.O'S collection this CD could even (dare a fan say it) be left out."
2,An inspirationless album,"This album was a real disappointment for me. After the wonderful musical album 'Every song has its play', I expected songs of the same quality and lyricism, but there was none like that in this album. The arrangement for each song is very interesting, but the songs are all lacking in memorable melodies and inspiration that are real strength of O'Sullivan's music."
4,No problems after 1 year,This has been a trouble free toaster with a nice bagel feature that we use on occasion. Seems to be very well built and does not look cheap.Would buy again
4,Finally,"you'd think it was easy to find a simple toaster that just toasted bread. after my 20 year old toaster finally died i went through two other toasters before i found this one. this toaster does what it's supposed to do. it browns bread relatively evenly, pops up when it's done, and doesn't use electricity when it's not in use. unlike the prior toasters i tried which couldn't lift a slice of thin cut rye bread, toasted 40% of one side twice as fast as the rest of the slice, and had enough forever glowing lights on them to facilitate aircraft landings. i recommend this to people who want a functional toaster with with an easy to clean exterior, at a reasonable price."
5,Great Toaster!,"My wife and I love this toaster. We replaced an old toaster that was given to us used, then we used it for many years. It wasn't a very good toaster, so it's hard to compare. This toaster is great though. Toast comes out great every time. Would recommend it to anyone. The price is very reasonable too."
4,"Sturdy and a good signal even with ""ol VGA""","Application: XP DIY computer with dual monitors, to access a large LCD (TV) mounted on a wall.My concern was that the older VGA standard cable wouldn't work well with a much newer technology TV/Monitor and video card. I was pleasantly surprised. Perfectly adequate for PC usage at this particular monitor's best 720p HD setting.Even at this length, the StarTech cable is sturdily made, easily coiled (useful to handling any excess length). Expectations were for a lesser quality insulation at this length."
2,Not a good product,"Excited by the price and seemingly positive reviews, I purchased these cables for the Ubuntu box I have hooked to an HDTV. The cable I have now is a VGA with one male end, one female, so I have to adapt it out and it sometimes falls out of the computer. I hooked these cables up and my computer would not output a resolution greater than 1024x768 no matter what I did. Thinking perhaps it was an issue with a driver update or Linux update (I've had plenty of Linux machines where something will mysteriously stop working after an update), I checked forums and the nVidia page. After that I went ahead and ran all the updates and made sure all my drivers were up to date, just in case. Still, nothing. Fiddled with all the menu options on the TV. Nope. To test if it was the cable itself, I snaked the old cable back, plugged it in, and got my actual, widescreen resolution back at 1366x768. This cable is probably fine if you're running a 1024x768 monitor but for widescreen, forget it."
2,Cheap Cables,"I bought these cables to hook up a computer to a projector. I knew I needed a high quality cable and hoped that these cables would work. I experienced serious ghosting on my display so I guess i need a better cable. The seller did allow me to send them back but by the time I pay shipping costs, it comes out to be about the same."
3,It is what I expected,"I gought this cable to connect my computer to my tv. It is been working fine. I was expecting it to be black but it came out grey, not a big deal but now stands out from the other cables that I have plugged into the tv."
2,Wish I'd spent a little more,"I'd seen mixed reviews at the time of purchase, but, given the price, thought I would give it a shot. Well, the signal comes through...except for the red. I'm disappointed because I will need to replace it and now don't have enough confidence in this particular product that I will end up paying much more to insure that I get a quality cable. Perhaps a replacement cable by the same company would be perfectly fine, but, based on my experience and that of others, I can't guarantee the replacement will work short or long-term."
4,"Good value, but very stiff","Let me start off by saying I am happy overall with this purchase. A local electronic store wanted around $30 for a VGA cable, so this price is much better than that.I bought this cable to connect my computer to the VGA socket on my new flat panel monitor.However, my monitor VGA interface is reccessed, so that the cable needs to be bent perpendicularly in order to be plugged in.Because the cable is so stiff, I had a hard time bending the cable so that it would plug in to the monitor.Also, the screws wont screw in properly because of the bulkynes of the plug.I've been using this cable now for over six months, and apart from the occasional unintentional unplugging, everything has been smooth."
1,Not a good product!!!!,I have hundreds of VGA cables and these are of the worst quality that I have ever bought!!! There are black hum bars that appear in the image on a simple computer to LCD install. spent 2 days trying to trouble shoot the problems to find out its this low quality cable. Buyer beware!!!
2,Cheap - but you do pay for what you get,"I received this cable in the mail and was excited to be able to finally use my monitor. However, when I opened the box, I realized that the metal guides that protect the pins were bent and crumpled. Thankfully I worked in IT years ago and knew that these can be bent back into place if you are careful. I would not recommend getting this product from this supplier."
1,Never even got it,I ordered this product in May 2011. It is August and I still do not have my purchase. DO NOT buy from this dealer
1,Absolute Crap,"Extremely poor quality. Doesn't work when I tried it on my tv and when I tried it on my monitor, everything on my screen had a shadowy effect and parts of my screen got cut off which did not happen with the previous monitor cable I had."
1,"No plug and play, no native resolution",I tried this cable with different monitors and lost the Windows 7 seeing the monitor as plug and play. Also the native monitor resolution is not availble. It works with some resolutions. I wish I passed on this. You should too.
2,Poor quality,"When attaching my laptop to my LCD monitor, this cable gave an ""image shadow"", where all images and text had a phase-shifted shadow to the right of it. Changing to a different (and frankly cheaper looking) cable fixed this issue."
5,Make sure to buy directly from Amazon,"I saw some negative reviews that bought their cables from discount vendors. I think some of these vendors are sending knock-off clones of this cable. I recommend steering clear of these, and make sure you buy directly from Amazon. It's a bit more expensive, but you're guaranteed to get the real name-brand cable.This is an excellent heavy-duty cable. I had terrible ghosting with my old VGA cable, which no amount of adjusting could fix.When this cable arrived, I immediately noticed how much thicker it was than the old cable. I estimate about twice the diameter of the old. Using this cable, my ghosting problems are completely fixed."
3,No red signal on one cable out of two,"Hello,I purchased 2 of these. One worked fine but the other no longer has a red signal. Everything looks bluish green and the Youtube logo is all black instead of red. They are low price cables but you may or may not get one that works properly."
4,Does its job,I bought this cord to hook up my laptop to my TV for a computer class I was teaching to an RV group. It worked fine and the presentation was a success.
5,Direct from PC to LCD TV,"I am using this cable to go from my Dell PC to my new 42"" Toshiba LCD, picture reproduction is excellent and no signal loss over the distance of 25'."
4,convenient,"Couldn't find this long of a cord anywhere for this cheap and it appears to be working just fine, so the quality is at the very least adequate. Convenient and easy transaction. Thanks!"
5,Quality Cables,I was shocked when these arrived. I could not believe that cables this inexpensive could be of such high quality. The cabling was as thick as expensive cabling and has given me a great display. Very shocked.
5,Good,This cable allows me to watch computer received videos on my big screen TV. They would not be very enjoyable on the computers monitor.
5,Works like a charm.,"I purchased this after losing the one used on my old computer. It works great for the older 1200 x 1080 monitor I attached it to. No noticeable defects, even after months of use. Don't be fooled into buying a fancy cable, this one works just as well for a portion of the price."
3,Stickers Peeling,"I ordered these planes for my son a several weeks ago. He loves them, but the only negative flaw with the planes are the stickers came off. Only after a few days of use, the stickers which includes the name and windows, peel off. They really should be painted on or a stronger adhesive should have been used at the manufacture! I did, however, call the manufacturer to complain and request a duplicate set of stickers be mailed to me, but they were of no help. Told me to go back to Amazon. Talk about passing the buck!"
5,This is a man worthy to be heard!,"As a student of Ananda Abinou, I know his teachings to be the TRUTH, plain and simple. He can give it to you nifty or grity, intellectually or the [simplified] version, but the ultimate realization is yours and yours alone!"
2,Not worth $10,"This movie was not worth the ten dollars paid.Story was non-existent as the description is NOT the movie but rather the backstory.Acting is cardboard and *ahem* ""action"" scenes were mediocre at best.The only time a swordfight ensues is near the end and is over in a few minutes.Rina Takeda is the only thing making this two stars instead of one.Her acting and karate is the only time to pay attention to the movie.Also,the film is only an hour long yet ends abruptly like this was a pilot for a tv series.The film can be watched with subtitles (recommended) or english dubbing which is horrendous.Extra features ok to view but final verdict on movie:NOT a purchase OR rental.Go find someone elses copy and offer them a dollar or two for it."
2,Weak,I thought it was an interesting concept but the story did not do anything for me. I can normally excusethis if the martiel arts content was strong but that wasn't the case here. I would not recomend this movie for any reason.
5,Excellent !!!,"An excellent book for beginners. If you are a newbie and you want to buy only one Lisp book, this is it! Highly recommended."
3,"OK, but...","This is my second Mastering series book. Also purchased Mastering SQL Serve r Express. Returned SQL and just got back from vacation where I started the Mastering VWD. VWD was better, but still doesn't flow well. Lots of examples and appeared promising, but light in explanation part. Maybe this was the intention of the book.So not a good book for newbies / intermediates."
4,"Vincent, Make Us More Idols to Worship","This movie was released in 1980, starring Ray Sharkey and Tovah Feldshuh. Ray is Vincent Vacarri, said character being loosely based on Bob Marucci, an idolmaker in his own right - Frankie Avalon, Fabian. Vincent is ever-seeking fame and fortune, but feels he can't cut it in the spotlight himself. Those who can't, teach (and capitalize from it). His drive to succeed is merciless, on himself, and others, but his character remains deep and thoroughly likeable. Tune in, Peter Gallagher fans, he is young and hot-hot-hot in this one, while Vincent molds him into idol material. As great looking as this guy is, physically it's not a far stretch but he benefits from instruction. Memories of Ed Sullivan rock and roll first viewings - Elvis, the Beatles, etc. - will hit strongly. Great music, interesting story line...Christine Taylor (Marsha in The Brady Bunch) is a reporter who wants to do more to our Idol than just interview him."
4,calm cool and collective,"calm cool and collectively sends chills up your spine.Leaves you cheering him on yet sending thoughts of discust that this may very well be happening in the world today!Great movie, a little slow at first then picks up to a strong steady pace."
5,"Awesome film, haven't seen one like this in a while","Lots of action and very sad moments. I don't really get emotional in most movies, but some scenes in this movie did. This was my first time watching a movie by the lead actor. Great movie, the plot was amazing. Fighting scenes were top notch and not one of those cheesy typical martial arts movies. I would def. recommend to give this movie a try.Note: Not for children, lots of gore and violence. Some nudity included as well."
5,"Wasn't expecting a lot, but I got surprised!","There are a whole lot of reviews for this movie, so I won't go into the details, but I loved it. I don't watch a lot of subtitled movies because they usually are so obviously out of sync that they are painful to watch, and I was surprised to find that when I got to the end of the movie I had forgotten it had subtitles at all. The action sequences are good (warning-a LOT of blood)and the story line really is pretty good. I think they did a great job setting up the connection between the two main characters and that was my favorite part. I watched this with my Prime membership for free and easily would say I would pay to watch it again - it's that good."
4,Great Film!,"One reviewer from the Washington Post likened the character as a Korean Jack Bauer.That about sums it up!A bit light on special features, but heavy on the action once it gets going."
4,Not Oldboy,"I came across The Man from Nowhere while trying to find a release date for the Blu-ray of A Bittersweet Life (to no avail). The story involves a mysterious man with a single emotional connection to the outside world. When that connection is taken from him, he goes out for revenge.Spoiler AheadThis is not A Bittersweet Life or Oldboy. A Bittersweet life would be the most similar because of the murky background of the leads, but I wish it was more like Oldboy with more flashbacks of Won Bin's character so the audience can better understand his disconnect and motivation. So-Mi needs more screen time, the ""Garbage"" scene where she lays out her character's heart is touching and poignant.Watch this if you want to watch a good Korean revenge flick."
5,"Fantastic noir action-packed!! Must see, but only for 18+","This movie was a pleasant surprise.I had friend brought DVD from S.Korea and I borrowed it to watch.Plot is simple as the other reviewer has mentioned, though I wouldn't have liked the movie as much if I knew the plot beforehand. Even though the plot is very simple and straightforward, I suggest you do not read any other review to find out what the plot is about this movie.Just enjoy the ride along with it and movie is over before you know it. I guarantee you it won't let you down.Acting is fantastic, the overall mood is very dark and eerily warming. Action is crazy good. Alot of violence.There are some sad moments, some fist-clenching moments and some deep sighing moments. The movie will absorb you from the beginning to the end.Must watch."
4,Man from nowhere who appears to be everywhere in the movie,"very good movie...action packed, good plot, strong emotions, a bit on the bloody side with the action sequences. Not for young kids obviously.Chinese mafia, korean police, mystery man as the protagonist, drugs and bodies involved with twists and turns that will keep your interest until the end.Definite R rated"
1,I had to comment to save you,"From buying this totally waste of technology. Call up any Good Guys / Circuit City and ask them what the most returned camera has been in the last few months - it'll be the new MicroMV cameras. They are all awful. The resolution is awful - all you have to do is look at footage on a TV and you'll see what i mean.Another HUGE disadvantage - MPEG2 encoding - NONE, I MEAN NONE, of the software NLE's (non-linear editors) support MPEG2 - so therefore, you can't use Premier, Final Cut Pro, etc...you are forced to use this 2-bit software app that Sony put out. It's awful. I tried it. It's painful. Premiere says they will NOT support MPEG2 until more camera makers adopt it - not likely in the near future.DON'T take a chance on such new technology, unless you're the guy who also owned the Sony mini-disc camcorder (discontinued after 6 months)."
4,Inger's solo work better than the Nymphs? I think so..,"Being a fan of the Nymphs I was very pleased to get a hold of Inger's solo work. I wanted to hear how she would sound on her own without the help of the band. I'm very pleased. From the very first track to the last you are taken on a ride that brings out several emotions. I get emotionaly exhausted by the time I'm through listening to it. My personal favorites are She's not your friend, which is a personal(and in my opnion, justified) attack on Courtney Love in regard to what she did to one of Inger's best friends. It's a deep dark song which showcases Inger's haunting vocal abilties. My other personal favorite is Beautiful Dead. This song definatly has the feel of Iggy and the Stooges. this album is a masterpiece and truly shows Inger's talents and her growth as a musician and person"
4,Very fine,"Having reviewed one volume of this fascinating series, I feel only a brief review is needed for any of the others. I bought this one really in order to hear the Cathedral Choir's version of ""Lo, the full, final sacrifice"" by Gerald Finzi, introduced to me by a close friend via the Finzi Singers' recording. As an anthem, it is certainly too long for use at anything other than special occasions, but having heard the St. Paul's Choir singing it, I can safely say that Finzi ""has the last word in anthems."" The other works on this disc are no less well-rendered. The balance is perhaps a little too much towards Victorian composers, but the series was just starting at this point, and in many ways John Scott's readings of their anthems sheds new light on the music. In addition, the sound quality is good. In short, a very fine record and worthy member of the ""English Anthem"" series."
4,Poway Ankle Boot,"This was my first online shoe purchase and I was unsure of how they would fit. This is my third pair of Nine West shoes and the size and fit has been true between all three pairs. Finding out the soles were quiet was a nice surprise! Finally, no noisy shoes. I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Rather Dissappointed,"Ordered the 8.5 X 14 inch dual tray storage clipboard and was sent an 8.5 x 16 inch version TWICE now. You can imagine how frustrating it is to have given the wrong item as a gift once only to turn around and be sent THE VERY SAME WRONG ITEM A SECOND TIME! Hell Amazon doesn't even offer the 8.5 X 16 on the website, so someone in the packing house doesn't know how to read a measuring tape."
2,mastering???,"How can you write a Mastering VB book with no mention of the masked edit control? This is a decent beginner's book, but as far as mastering goes, it lacks the depth of knowledge."
3,Size is not every thing,"I picked this book over other beginner's books because the others I compared seemed to be for beginners with no clue of what they are doing.I've read upto chapter 4, and I noticed that some the explanations are verbose. Several examples in the book can be illustrated with one good example. I can drag on and on about how this book can be more concise. If you like such a writing style, you will feel right at home when you read this book. But I need to stop writing my comment becase I still have 1000 tedious pages to go.FYI, I am familiar with VC++ but not with VB, so my comment might not be applicable to those with different background."
1,Will Make a Good Door Stop,"I am relatively new to VB programming. I purchased this book because of the great reviews. What a mistake. The author glosses over topics, which I feel, should be covered in more depth, especially for the beginner. I wracked my brain trying to figure out the bad code examples used in this book. I try to purchase books from Amazon with at least 4.5 to 5 stars, and for the most part, I have been very satisfied. The author must have had his friends write the good reviews for this one. Save a tree, don't buy this book."
5,A MUST-READ,"This book should be required reading for all considering the paralegal profession, and even those (like myself) who have been a paralegal for some time. Astl writes anecdotally, the book reads like a novel, with great quick tips and productivity improvement suggestions. She even gets somewhat psychological and offers some pairings of different personality types with areas of law that I found to be intriguing. I work in PI, and I really would like to be in a different area of law, and the book has given me some really valid ideas to consider. Paralegal programs should have this book as required reading - Astl is obviously a veteran with a lot to offer those of us in the profession. BTW, I know the author, she is the wife of an attorney who shares space with the attorney I work for. She did NOT ask me to write this."
2,Not so fast,i know its cheap dont get this one its not good. Buy the expensive ones trust me this thing fires like 10-15ft at best. Buy the expensive ones dude dont buy these cheap ones.
5,If you're into PG Stuff,Racer X's reunion definitely brings back memories of old. I you're into heavy shredding and want to listen to pure metal bliss....and of course get to listen to PG....my main man.....this album is it....worth the wait....worth the money!
1,This is country? Please!!!,"This song is a joke to country music! The video is dumb. I see no connection between a bunch of women surrounding Shane Minor wearing not much and loving someone. Get a grip folks! People keep calling this guy country! He is not on the same planet as country music is. Mercury records has a nasty habit of supporting ""country"" artists like Shania Twain and Shane Minor. Want to check out a couple of good acts by the name of Shane? Check out Shane Stockton and Shane McAnally. They are good musicians. They know what country music should be like. As for Shane Minor, I hope this single isn't the best song on his album. If it is, watch out for another one hit wonder!!!!!!"
1,Terrible!,This movie is an insult to ALL hood films. I should have stook with my old No Limit films. Does the book an injustice. Cain from Menace II Society look like was on crack.
3,Dasheiks 2 Cents: It's Alright.,"I didn't expect this movie to any better than what it was. I'm glad someone finally used a Donald Goines book to make a movie instead of just writing some terrible screenplay. What I hate is giving rappers top billing when they are no more than just cameo performers. Stop lying to the consumer. That's false advertising. John Bryant is an integral part of this film and his name doesn't even appear on the cover. That is so disrespectful. His name should have been third behind Tyrin Turner and Clifton Powell. With all considered, I don't think this movie was that terrible. I've seen much worse."
3,"Long on visual beauty, short on information","I commend the author for publishing these pictures notwithstanding the criticism she received from another reviewer for doing so. Those interested in looking into this world were hungry for this information. I do agree with the previous reviewer, however, that the book should have contained explanatory captions and information in the context of the photographs. I wanted to know the story behind the photograph, and this was lacking."
3,Got tired of the way Hawk Talked....,"While reading this book, I did find the plot interesting, a good Spenser novel, but to be honest, I have to agree with some of the last reviews that were placed...Hawk and his ebonic vocabulary got tiring...I do not know why Parker had to make this character so annoying throughout this book. 1/2 into this book, I could not wait for it to end. Hawk was dumbed down, and for that, I am not sure if I am looking forward to another Parker book...only if Hawk is taken out!!"
3,Gives Us a Deeper View into Hawk,"Hawk getting shot in the back is certainly a way to change the series a bit and add new perspective to old characters. And because Hawk was shot, we get a view of his love interest and his moral perspective, which has been lacking in previous books.I would never claim that an RBP novel will stretch your mind to any great extent, but they are great filler material for those days when you travel, are sick or spending the day on a beach. For those purposes, this is one of the better recent Spenser novels"
2,Bad is good,"A bad Spenser novel is still better than most genre competitors. To make a long story short (unlike some of the reviewer/author wanna-bes...), Parker's publisher has narrowed his margins and over-leaded his sentences. Parker, himself is producing fewer words (Some of the pages look like lists of words!). Spare writing is starting to look like lack of ideas or boredom. This should be published as a novelette or a long short story. Still, I look forward to each new novel. Come on Bob, a little more writing for our money! Please!"
2,All right...Maybe,Hard to say. This is the third novel I've read. This one caused me to work to finish it. I just could not get that interested in it. The other two were Ok but this one didn't really deliver. At least for me. The coldness of the Hawk is good in a Novel but I have never seen anyone that tough. I have known some tough ones. Then a lawyer taking his whole career into jeprody to help his freind seemed a little make beleive. I hope he can do a little better in the future. If not this could be my last one of his to read.
2,Parker at his endgame?,"In my opinion, Cold Service is a mere shadow of the kind of writing Robert B. Parker did at some earlier points in his career. That said, looking back, I have to admit that I now believe Parker has always been overrated by many readers, including me.In this novel, Spenser and Hawk are reduced to little more than their usual macho bravado and banter. There's just not much substance here, and more unfortunate, not much entertainment value either. Has Parker gotten lax in success? or has he just burned out or run out of ideas? As much as I've enjoyed a few of his earlier works, he really wasn't that great to begin with."
1,Boooooooorrrrrrrring!,"I couldn't believe this warmed-over Spenser novel. I was a big fan of the series early on, but it's just slid downhill over the years. The early novels had wit and charm, but these just seem like a couple of lame old guys going through their tired old ""white guy black guy"" routine.Here's a fact for you: BOTH Susan and Hawk use the line ""Another fine mess you've gotten us into, Ollie."" What, was Parker watching Laurel and Hardy or something while he was writing this? Have Hawk and Susan gotten so boring, old-fashioned and culturally similar that they quote 1920's movie stars? Or is Parker just phoning this crap in for another paycheck?Whatever it is, this one stinks. The characters and situations are hacknyed, the action dull, the dialog leaden. Avoid."
2,"Been there, done that","I have to agree with my fellow reviewers that gave this booka less than stellar review.First time, it was Spenser that got shot, and need to recover.This time, it's Hawk that got shot and need to recover and seekrevenge.Even the opening quote (from ""Kill Bill"" from Star Trek) hasbeen done before. That was immediately a bad/warning sign forme.Even the dialog in the book are getting boring and repetitive.I am not going to discuss the details of the book, because therereally aren't that much to write about. You read the smart-assbanter between Hawk & Spenser, see them rough up some peoplewhile trying to get info, Hawk gets his revenge.There, I think that about wraps up the whole book in a nut-shell."
1,Drivel,What a disappointment! The first few chapters of this book are essentially meaningless fill and drivel. I will avoid this author in the future. Why not just one word per page? Then you can sell more paper!
3,Cold Service,"""Cold Service"" is the 32nd Spenser novel by Robert B. Parker. This novel is quite different in that Spenser is not the focal character, but rather his friend Hawk. It is a role reversal as Spenser helps Hawk and narrates the story as usual. Hawk is brutally beaten by a Ukranian mob from Marshport. He was trying to protect Luther Gillespie, a bookie. Hawk works hard at regaining his physical health. He vows to avenge Luther's death and his assault by getting even with the Ukranians and the mayor of Marshport, Boots Podolak, a very corrupt man who controls much of the organized crime in Marshport. I enjoyed the novel as usual. It is not a mystery as such, but Hawk's revenge is entertaining. It's a novel about good guys and bad guys, and Spenser is there for Hawk but little else. Maybe this should have been the 1st Hawk novel rather than the 32nd Spenser novel."
2,"Been There, Done That","I, too, am getting tired of Parker's plots and characters. First, they are elongated short-stories; second, this particular novel is but a theme already used by the author - ""a bunch of bad guys, let's get 'em"" - and; third, the unchanging same-old-same-old relationship between Spenser and Susan is getting to be boring, tiring, and unrealistic; fourth, why does every woman who sees or meets Hawk want to bed him immediately? Is he so obviously the ""Stud of the Century""? Well, pardon me while l go off to read Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson, Reginald Hill et al..and then joyfully re-read Colin Dexter and Ross MacDonald. They are, among a few others, the truly great ones."
4,Fantastic Tailgate Chair,"I bought this chair for our tailgates this year and it is the most comfortable chair that I can imagine for such a purpose. I got the attachable tray with the chair and it works great for a day long fun time with my friends. Everyone wants to try it out and says that they love it, too. The only problem is that the mesh came undone at the foot after the first game and I had to tie it back."
4,Great product,"A breeze to assemble, this overdoor storage rack saved me so much space in my closet. Highly recommended."
1,Worthless Piece of Junk!!,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! ITS WORTHLESS! This product is cheaply made. It isn't worth your money. I did not place canned food on the unit; just lighter things such as oatmeal packets and granola bars. The unit does not hold up under the weight. It easily bends and falls off the door.
4,Works great for DVD storage.,"Bought two of these and hung them in a closet as ""overflow"" storage for the family DVD collection. They work great. They are built stiffly enough that they don't sag under the weight of the DVDs, and the wire design means that dust doesn't collect in the bins. The only down side is that I had to install them with a ""spacer"" that I made. If you install them directly against the wall, a DVD will not sit ""book-wise"" in the top shelf and the lower shelves are pushed away from the wall a bit. Also, if you'd planned to install them over a door (with the included hangers) they won't work for DVDs (at least not seating the DVDs ""book-wise"" in the top rack). It was no big deal, but was something I didn't expect and cost me a few minutes extra on the install time, thus four-stars instead of five."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"When I recieved this rack I only got the top rack...no screws, no over the door hooks, no directions...NOTHING! So all I have is a huge cardboard box with a flimsy wire top rack with nothing to install it. For all the money I spent on this item it is not worth it!!! From the picture and instructions I was expecting double racks with over the door hangers and a few screws...this is a huge rip off...DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,I'm Happy With It,"I don't know what some people expect to get for $20 but I think this shelf is just fine. It freed up a lot of space in my pantry (closet). I probably will want to secure it to the door, since it's just hanging by the over-the-door hangers that come with it. I was almost scared off by some of the negative reviews so I'm glad I decided to go with it. Nothing fancy but certainly sturdy enough for my purpose."
4,Like the price,"This product Meets expectations, fast delivery, and competitive price it is ok for the price but the should include some type of tape that can be use instead than screws recommend this seller and product"
2,"NOT as pictured, LOUSY buy","The storage rack I received was in 2 parts, which was fine. I'm used to that. I just used some Command hooks to help stabilize the shelves so they wouldn't swing out when I opened or shut the door. The REAL problem is that the top of the rack I received is curved. It may be decorative, but just precisely how am I supposed to hang a shelf unit by 2 over-the-door hangers on a CURVE? The hangers slide around, the rack shifts, and one of my Command hooks has already broken off because of the shifting weight. This was a LOUSY $20 shelf, and I wish I had realized it when I still had the packaging so I could send this piece of garbage back. If you buy one of these, check the top before you hang it! If it's flat, fine, you got a good rack. If it's curved, send it back immediately!"
1,Very Cheaply Made!,What a waste of money! Metal is soft and bends! Not meant to hold can goods or heavy items! I do not recommend!
4,Spice rack,"I bought this because I live in an apartment and my landlord frowns on putting a lot of holes in the wall and I liked this because it's just over the door however when I got it, it has an optional 2 screws to make it more stable. I can't use them (because of the landlord) and so it doesn't stay as nice on the door when you open and close it. However, it does hold all my spices and then some!"
4,Works just fine,This works great for items that are short like canned goods. You would need to put screws in. Although the screws that came with it don't have big enough screw heads.
5,Great Love Songs,"Loved the the love songs in Kahbi Alvida Naa Kehna I think there are realy nice love balets I listen to the cd every day I give it a five star quality, because I find the music to be very crisp and clear even though I donot understand all that they are saying, but they sing the words clear and that makes it easy for me to learn the words. Also I saw the movie and I try to put the words together from the seens of the love songs that is in the movie.Thank you O. Lopez from FL USA"
5,SPY THRILLER,I think this is one of the best all times spy thrillers that I have ever watched. It is a favorite of mine; I first saw it about 10 years ago and then again just recently on my Kindle. If you really want to be entertained please take the time to watch this money. I feel it is better than the original.
2,questioning Beck's integrity,"After finishing Leaving the Saints left me wondering: do I believe Ms. Beck? My answer: not really.Although there were a few things that gave me pause about Ms. Beck's story, I'll cite one example. Throughout the book I consistently admired the relationship between Martha and John. At the end of the book when Beck updates the reader on several of the people in the novel I was wishing for an update on Mr. Beck. The reader was only left to assume that they were happily living in Phoenix.As such, I was very suprised to read that John and Martha divoriced over 10 years ago--about the same time that the events described in ""Leaving the Saints"" draw to a close. The details of the Beck's divorice is not my business, but at the same time, a reader would NEVER gather that the Beck's were on the verge of divorice from the way she portrays their relationship in the book.It makes me wonder how honest the picture that Martha Beck paints really is...P.S. I am not Morman."
5,A Compelling Story,"I'm not sure why I picked up this book but I'm glad I did. I don't know much about the author and wasn't sure if the story of her life would be interesting to me. But having lived in Utah and having tried ""mormonism"", I was curious.The author does an excellent job at taking us in her life. She had a very difficult childhood and she takes us through her journey to self-discovery and happiness. I was touched by her strenghth and I must say I have great admiration for her. Ditto her husband, who seems like the nicest man.It's entertaining and inspiring without being too preachy. A good book to learn more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) at the same time."
5,Excellent exposé,"this is the type of book we all need more of for several reasons; two of which are one, it's is a brave exploration of the indisputable fact that religious history often does not stand up to unemotional scrutiny and two, the issue of incest in not only the Mormon church but our very askew culture of excess and repression. By sharing her painful experience with us, Beck has given us a portrait of the kind of genuine individuation that comes when one leaves behind the 'tribe"" mentality"" and stands up against male perversions and betryal of being molested by her father. Both experiences are deep, painful and worthy of our consideration if we are ever to evolve into thinking, self-volitional human beings free of superstition and any patriarchal claim, whether it be familial or governmental, on our ability to think and live an athentic life. Good for you Ms. Beck!"
2,Unreliable narrator?,"She's a fun writer--little twists of language and imagery that creates a wonderful voice. She brings up an important topic: child abuse perpetuated by unexpected persons, especially the ostensibly pious. My concern? Unreliable narrator. She stereotypes the Mormon community just as she stereotyped the Harvard community in her previous book --if I remember correctly, almost every Harvard character was intellectually insecure, overly demanding, rather cruel, and a bit out-of-sync with reality. In this book, the Mormons are similarly unreal--all sorts of exaggerations or falsehoods pepper the book. I attended Harvard, and have had extensive association with Mormons, and can say that her perception of each community is exaggerated at best, unreal at worst. I assume that she believes what she is saying--I just have to wonder if her reality exists. Therefore, her other accusations are suspect."
1,Half-truth buffet,"Martha Beck has an agenda. Like many people who leave the LDS church, she has an axe to grind. If you want to get a full understanding of Mormon culture, visit your local ward and speak with Latter-Day Saints. And if Provo is such a terrible place to live, why is it continually ranked as one of the best places to live in objective, actuarial studies (not the rantings of a woman who will never be the writer or intellect that her slandered father was). PS-The book reads like stereo instructions in Japanese."
1,Heart broken,"I am sadden by this deliberate attack on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. For anyone looking for the truth you can contact the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or simply talk to your mormon friend or neighbor. I feel nothing but the deepest sympathy for Martha she has lost so much more than the ""mormon faith""."
2,Throw Dad to the Dogs AFTER he dies,"Why is it that ex-Mormons feel it a necessity to rip the church and its leaders apart? Beck is the same as other ex-Mormons, just acting under a different umbrella--child abuse. I'll be the first to admit that there are problems in the hierarchy of the church, but which church doesn't have its problems? So tell me, is it her word against Joseph Smith's concerning the veracity of his words? Should I believe her or Joseph? Surely Oprah's ""victim crowd"" filled with women who hate men and love Dr. Phil will enjoy such a book that not only shoots down a religion, but talks of how a woman is a victim of child abuse, especially by a church leader."
2,Tricky to review,"How do you review a book like this? This is going to feel like a journal entry or a confession and not a review, but here goes. I happen to be a practicing Mormon. I haven't lost my faith, but I am one of those people who is very interested in other people's experiences. I read this book with many conflicting emotions. It's a little hard to read because it's kind of bitter. It's interesting to read, because I found myself - mostly - thinking ""really?? I don't feel that way..."" Mostly, this book made me sad that there are people out there who are so dissatisfied that they feel the need to write a book like this. I didn't buy it with the intent to judge the author, but it was not fun to read nor was it enlightening. I'm an avid reader...I think I'll stick to fiction."

My cleaning jetsare still running but the fountain is not as high.But for $150 less than local I have my pool clean again."
