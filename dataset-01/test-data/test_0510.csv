4,good book,"I haven't quite finished this book yet, but I am half way through it. It has explained a lot of things that I have been trying to deal with my 10 yr old. I am a single mother and his dad is in another state, so it is up to me to do good for him and learn how he learns. I recommend this book to any single mother of boys."
5,Excellent tool!,I have several of these and use and abuse them every day.I have never had another of this style cordless impact but know I would not find a better tool!
1,Very Lengthy and Repetative,The book has been prescribed in our college for advanced comp arch. I found that advanced comp arch was the most difficult subject because of this book. Buy this book only if you are forced by the university.
3,Taking a step away from their roots,"I think that this CD is definately worth buying, even though their best songs were written on or before so much for the afterglow. So much for the afterglow did seem to mark their departure from their earlier heavy sounding and feeling music. Some of their new stuff seems a bit too produced and orchestrated. They've lost some of that edge. My recomendation would still be to buy *every* cd they've made and judge for yourself. I doubt you will go wrong. If you really want everclear, then see them in concert. They're awesome."
5,Gift for my sister inspired her profitable business,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister because she is a natural at organizing. Every time she comes to my house, she's trying to organize me! Anyway, I bought this book for her, and she gobbled it up and read it in a day, and said ""I LOVE MY BOOK! IT HAS A CD OF FORMS AND EVERYTHING! IT HAS ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED TO GET STARTED."" Before I knew it, she had her own business cards and brochures printed up - very professional looking (imagine my surprise when I learned she got them from this book, and just used her computer to make some small changes for her own business!) and now - 3 months later, she has just quit her full time job to be a full-time professional organizer because she has too many projects to limit them to just the weekends and evenings. She is so happy. Thank you to the author for writing such a great and inspiring book. For my sister, it clearly made a huge difference!"
4,Pasion De Gavilanes,Watched it on TV and loved it! Bought the DVD set and still love the story! I can't believe it's been remade for TV again. Now it's called Fuego en la Sangre and still love watching it again!!!
1,Pasion de Gavilanes,"This ""novela"" version is woefully edited. Content continuity is absent, and one has no idea what the novela is supposed to be all about. It apparently jumps from chapter to chapter with portions missing. I do not recommend this novela version to anyone--mine wound up in the trash can."
4,Great video!,"This video is very basic and good for beginners. Some of the moves were a little difficult to pick up on. The band is nice, but not the best quality."
1,Uggh!!,Way too complicated for a DVD instructional!! I do enjoy the stretch workout and use it regularly. The rest of it is overkill : ((
5,Recommeded in Prevention Magazine and no wonder!,"I ordered this based on an advertisement in Prevention magazine AND the five star rating on Amazon. I am glad I did. My husband and I only lasted 18 minutes but what a wonderful 18 minutes it was. The time flew by and we kept up pretty well for the first time. We will feel it tomorrow I am sure. Erin is motivating, cues well, demonstrates and starts off at a slower pace to get the positioning and technique then speeds it up. It is all so do-able. As soon as we reached our maximum (we are older adults) my husband announced ""She is a keeper!"". There are a lot of exercise DVD's we have really enjoyed but this will go to the top of our collection."
1,What a waste of time and money!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book as it received such glowing reviews. Now I am mystified. There's no substance, its psycho mumble. I quit half way through and tossed it out afterward."
4,Three Geeks In A Garage,"What were these guys smoking when they made this cd? Whatever it was, they've turned out a most unusual debut instrumental powerhouse of a cd! This album has intensity and structure that few bands can claim. How to describe the music, you ask? I'm not sure. It is rock and it is more. It has enormous intensity and rhythm without losing its way. It's cerebral and visceral at the same time. It gets as far out as many experimental jazz recordings do, but, it is not jazz. The closest comparison I can make is to The Dirty Three, and, that is a compliment coming from me. Both bands have a sound that is not like others. They both sound like random jamming, but, there is so much more. I look forward to hearing more things from the lads, and, maybe, just maybe, some vocals thrown into the stew just to see what they could come up with. Just a suggestion, lads. Don't want to interfere with your creative process, now."
4,Kraut-rock meets Indie-rock meets your head,"With their roots planted deeply within Kraut-rock and Indie rock, Turing Machine provides a great set of tunes that leave you feeling alive. Their version of anti-pop has crunchy lead guitar, simple yet effective basslines and impressive drum patterns with enought polyrythms to keep you guessing. This is definitely music to drive to. Enjoy."
1,MAGNUM PI - DVD'S,"BIG FAN OF THE SERIES BUT THIS PRODUCT IS VERY DISSAPOINTING. HAVE PURCHASED 5TH, 6TH AND 7TH SEASON. ALL WHICH HAVE PRODUCTION AND DISPLAYING PROBLEMS. BEWARE TO FUTURE BUYERS !!!"
4,on time,on time and got the promised product. ordered a new dvd works well and shines. Don't know what else to say but great order.
3,episode not full length,"The Man From Man Marseilles atleast 4 minutes of the episode is missing the part with Lt. Tanaka speaking in french, everything else otherwise is ok with the fifth season."
4,Magnum P.I. - The Complete Fifth Season... very entertaining,I found the fifth season of Magnum P.I. to be very entertaining. I had previously bought the first and second seasons of Magnum P.I. This season continues in the same vein. I liked the packaging and that they put the episodes on single-sided discs.
4,Beginning of shows decline,"As a huge Magnum PI fan only 2nd to Simon and Simon, season 5 was the beginning of the shows decline through some outlandish subject matter through some of the episodes. There's always been political elements to the show, but they seemed to stretch one's imagination beyond realism. Season 2 through season 4 are the 3 ""must owns"" if you were to only have 3. The shows subject matter was at its peak and was fresh during those seasons. The Vietnam era ended right around the time I was born so being under 40, I tended to enjoy the episodes most like season 2's football episode featuring Dick Butkus, Season 3's episode with Rick and AJ Simon along with Morgan Fairchild, as well as season 4's with Magnum meeting Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker."
4,Valio la pena.,"esta pelicula la compre por que Santiago Segura es uno de mis actores favoritos,pero la pelicula que vale la pena de este DVD es Dying of Laughter,en lo personal me parece muy buena ,las otras dos no me gustaron ,pero por lo que pague por el dvd,estoy satisfecho."
4,MEMORIES,THIS CD TOOK ME BACK TO WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND DREAMED OF BEING IN LOVE. THIS CD IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION. NO ONE SINGS OF LOVE LIKE PATSY CLINE AND THE MUSIC IS PURE COUNTRY CLASSIC.
5,Cuerpo Sin Alma,I have been looking for this song for many years. It is one of the best songs I have ever heard. If anybody can get this for me I will buy it immediatly!!!!
3,More,"This touched me as a mother. But Istill want the movie ""Out Of Darkness"" also played by Dianna Ross as the lead character"
4,Good summer reading,"Light, real, potent ....those who have spent time searching for answers in their own lives will enjoy this book as new and deeper insights into life and street wisdom come to them."
1,It doesn't work...,"I can't get this thing to work. I played it when I was a kid and it's the most fun I have ever had with a pc game. Even though I knew this game was for xp and not for windows 7, I still read online that it worked on windows 7. I read forums and such and I also had my friend (who is a genius with computers) do everything he could to get it to work but to no avail. So if someone could be so kind as to tell me how to get it to work, that would be great. Because I love this game and I don't want to waste $18 on something that doesn't work."
1,Even the great Thompson blows one now and then,"This is Jim Thompson's attempt to write a funny book.He should not have tried.Whereas there are a few good comic juxtapositions, the basic fact is that the characters are unbelievable, unlikeable, and forgettable. The plot contrivances depend upon outrageous coincidences, unlikely motivations, and incompetent authorities.Imagine the Munsters mixed with Elmore Leonard and you get a sense of what this book is like.I've read most of his work. This is the first really bad one.I suggest you don't waste your time as I did."
3,Where's Waldo? With blood and guts.,"First off the art was amazing in that it was extremely detailed. A lot of shock value here, sex, blood, violence all magnified by the meticulous detail. It was like playing Where's Waldo with blood and guts. I usually like Frank Miller even though he revisits the same themes in his comics (demise of society + values), not a bad topic but gets stale quick when you really get into all his work.As for the summary of the story it's been done many many times, I'm usually tolerant of rehashed archetypes, there's only so many to go around right? But here it was kind of boring. Loved his Sin City comics though, checks those out if you haven't."
3,It's OK,"I bought the first two books many years ago and I liked the art way back then. The story was OK but it seems less ok in the last volume. But for what it's worth, now I have all three."
4,Short and Stout,"Frank Miller has said manga influences his work. Easy to believe with Hard Boiled. It reminds me of Miller's RoboCop meets Bladerunner, but mucho bloodier. The art is somethin', even if it looks like an adult Where's Waldo, which I'm only saying to be snarky, and believe Geoff Darrow is an art god. But beware the book's shortness."
5,"Review from ""an old lady.""","Outside of being remarkably akin to ""The Insider"" sound track, I found the music to be moving and even emotional at times (""Sorrow,"" ""Patricide""). The solos (cello and trumpet {I'm writing this w/o the CD insert so I might be mis-remembering the latter}) are especially lovely and strong. I would have wished for information on the insert to be more meaningful, i.e., an explanation for the title ""Progeny,"" did the ""lyrics"" mean anything? (some foreign language?), length of time of each track. Oh well. I loved the movie and watched it on HBO quite a few times as well, even tho' I own the video.(In case you are wondering about my age, it's only 61!)"
4,Klaus Badelt Influence,"Wonderful soundtrack. You can definitely hear Klaus Badelt (Pirates of the Caribbean)in some of the tracks - so much so that it sounds a little ""pirate-y"". Badelt co-produced this with Zimmer and did some additional music and arranging. Interesting list of names in the thank you list: includes Harry Gregson-Williams (Narnia soundtracks) and John Powell (Bourne soundtracks). You can't lose with Zimmer."
5,good good soundtrack,"a very good soundtrack. I've after hans zimmer's works all the time. For this one, everytime when I listen to the track no. 3 & 13, I get myself excited. You know, your body just moves with the music automatically."
1,"Another ""forgettable"" soundtrack.","I don't like the music of Hans Zimmer. I can't believe Ridley Scott has choosen this guy to score an important film like Gladiator. That was really a job for Bruce Broughton or David Arnold and not for a little New Age musician. Who remember the so ""fantastic"" score from ""The English Patient""? Well, what can you expect a guy who needs a help from a woman to compose a score?"
5,Wonderful Mix of Passion and Might,"This soundtrack is possibly the first to successfully meld the might and granduer of ancient Rome with the beauty of some of its less seen aspects. The soundtrack has a mysterious quality about it that characterizes Roman culture. The musical selections and compositions reflect extremely well the moods of the different scenes. Each composition is rich with sound and passion. Each track uses suberbly scored instrumental music to evoke the emotion for that scene. The brass and percussion play well for the battle and confrontational scenes and the strings, chorals and woodwinds provide the perfect sound for the mysterious and emotional scenes. All in all, this is quite possibly the best soundtrack that I have ever heard."
4,"Ok, for a soundtrack","The movie was great, just seems to me the sound track was a little let down after watching the movie, only music worth the whole cd price was the last piece."
4,Hanz Zimmer Does it again.,"If you like other Hanz Zimmer soundtracks like Crimson Tide, this should be a welcome CD to your collection. This is one tiny step up from most of his other work. On one end, you have the heroic and patrioc action music that he is so very good at. But on the other hand he serves up some more quiet tunes, like he did on The Thin Red Line.4 Stars because some of the stuff seemed recycled. But at least it seemed recycled of his good work."
5,"opinion, don't look at the stars","It has a poetic theme of fate to it, and in a sense you have to understand the mood it sets for you to appreciate the music. With all the new ways to stretch out music, you really have to listen to hear whether or not the music is really just mindless repeats, or that moment in a moment type of phrase."
5,Music of the Spheres,"A really stunning soundtrack featuring memorable passages and tunes that cover a gamut of emotions, from battle-panic and chaos to pride and awe to grief and sorrow, sometimes fast and furious and pounding, other times haunting and ethereal. The music compliments many different scenes in the movie so well but the truth is that it transcends the movie and plays like a soundtrack to all our highs and lows in life.Dramatic passages played with throbbing drums and horns that fire the blood juxtapose with dreamy, distant-sounding pieces featuring a liquid, mesmeric background voice singing foreign words that transport you far beyond the place you are in.The best music is music that stirs one's soul and, dramatic that it sounds, this music did for me. Music of the Spheres indeed.I highly recommend it."
1,SONGS ARE CUT OFF! Get the CD instead!,"The amazing music of the soundtrack deserves 5 stars, but the MP3 download version does not! Each track cuts out with a staticky sound right before the song is over. Bad encoding. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. GET THE CD INSTEAD."
5,Takes you back to the film,"I really loved the movie Gladiator, and this soundtrack takes you right back to it. Great for any fan of the movie."
5,Just what we needed,"After searching hardware store in our neighborhood we gave up on this hard to find size and went on line. It was easy to find on this site, saved us time and had a great price!"
5,Love the over the door hook rack,"This is great!! My husband never got around to making a wooden one for hanging our coats up, and I just broke down and bought this thinking it would work until he got one up. This works so well, I don't even think that making a wooden one is on the honey do list anymore."
1,RIP-OFF,"Ordered this flag to fly at our unit headquartes in Afghanistan and later take home as a momento. However, when it arrived, it was NOT a POW/MIA flag.The item I received was a black, 3x5 flag with the word ""OCCUPY"" written on it.This is fraud and a disgrace to the memory of every POW/MIA Soldier and those of us who still remember them."
3,Interesting,"As much as I LOVE this man's voice, I think this CD does not show him off at all. I don't think that he has the type of voice for the big showstopper's that take up more than half of the cd. Hence, his best numbers (and when I say best, I mean truly phenomenal)are ""Bring him Home"", ""Gliding"", ""My Love's like a Red Red Rose"", ""Music of the Night"", and ""The Rose"". The rest of the numbers are just dissapointing to me, and usually things grow on me. Not this time. He does songs that he just shoudn't even attempt! ""Pity the Child"" was a bad idea. So was ""Gethsemane"". He just doesn't have that kind of voice. The big plus of this cd, however, is the accompaniment. He has a FULL orchestra behind him, and it really adds a lot when placed next to Chuck Wagner's cd(who uses a three piece rock band!). If you have heard this man's voice, and you love it, then this cd might be right for you. If you are just looking for a new solo cd, I would suggest that you keep on looking."
3,Her son's books are better.,"Yevgenia Ginzberg has authored the moving books of the ""whirlwind"" saga, but they are pale and boring compared to her son's books: Generations of Winter and The Winter's Hero. There was a lot more to the Stalin era than the gulag, and her son, Vasily Aksoyonov, who grew up in the gulag, tells the story of Russia much more movingly. His characters and their story will break your heart."
5,Return of the DeFrancos! Wow!,"The long awaited return of the DeFranco Family has finally arrived with the release of their two albums onto one CD, with a bonus of 2 previously unreleased songs. The singles from the 70's are here, ""Heartbeat Its a Lovebeat"", ""Abra-ca-dabra"", ""Save the Last Dance for Me"", and ""Write Me"". A must listen to are songs like, ""Love the Way You Do"", ""I'm the Only One"" and ""Hold Me"". The two previously unreleased songs, ""Gee, Baby"" and ""Drummer Man"" definitely add to this excellent collection. This is just the beginning for the DeFranco Family and this CD will definitely leave you wanting more!"
5,A Slice of Childhood,"Actually the music on this CD is more than bubblegum. Many of the musicians were heard on 5th Dimention, Carpenters, Partridge Family albums. They are high caliber, and so are the songs. Especially the album ""Save the Last Dance for Me."" Every track seems to exude an irresistible catchiness that holds up even today. Well worth getting, as only single tracks of their work were available before."
3,Only for the die-hard fan,"This work exhibits considerable skill and fortells of greatness to come but is far from the quality of ""Can't Look Away"" or works done with Yes. I can not recommend this, particularly if you are just discovering Trevor's work."
2,Cannot convert encrypted WMA files,"Most music websites download files in an encrypted WMA format. The software that accompanies this product cannot convert these files to an MP3 format. Unless you want to just convert your CDs to mp3, this product is useless."
3,Functional but not as good as the foam,"I bought this gel pad for comfort on an 8hr trail ride and my arse was very sore. Next day I tried a friends foam seat saver and it was better. If you looking for comfort for a long ride use the foam, but if its just for quick rides the gel pad should do just fine."
2,Great for a while,"This thing worked just fine on soft American-style cheese but when I tried it on imported Swiss or jarlsberg, even though I trimmed the rind from the jarlsberg, it cracked after about one half-pound of each and the wire lost its tension, then the thing broke in two. What a shame. This slicer with quality plastic would be the world's best cheese slicer. As it is, I'm afraid it's typical Chinese junk, and I don't mean the boat!"
4,Great slicer for the money.,"I give it a 4 of 5 due to the fact that one of the wires is starting to get lose with minimal use. Overall they are great, no other complaints."
2,Great idea but broke after 2 weeks,This is a great idea but it is made of plastic and mine broke after cutting cheddar a few times.
2,Liked it while it lasted,Have had this for about 3 months and it worked great while it lasted. Unfortunately it just snapped in half while taking a thin slice of monterey jack. Gonna give theMessermeister Stainless Steel Thick-N-Thin Cheese Slicernext. Hopefully it will last somewhat longer.
2,"Convenient, but rather puny","Yes, it's great to just grab a simple cheese slicer from the drawer and go to town on a block of cheese when you crave that midnight snack, but this one can't handle the major league stuff. It snapped in half on a 5lb block of Tillamook Cheddar. I got precisely what I paid for."
5,ADVANTAGES FROM VALUE-LED ORGANIZATIONS,"This book provides an understanding of recommended conceptsfor improving both straightforward and complex organizationpractises. It covers all requirements, including leadership andgovernance responsibilities, ethics and business law, financialand management accounting, employee and investor responsibilitiesfor successful execution of an organization's goals while ensuring positive contribution and reward to clients, customers,stakeholders and investors, our society and economic system.Its examples of the success of value-led organizations included therein illustrate what is being achieved with courage."
4,I know that other guy has that one album and thats it,"because if you bought Toots - LIVE,you'd realize what you're missing by sitting at home listening to that disc, instead of standing in the audience dancing until you are drenched in sweat, and have to drag yourself away from the music to buy another Red Stripe.Toots makes great music... but there is nothing... NOTHING like seeing and hearing the guy in the flesh. He is a jamaican reggae version of James Brown... and he just makes you want to party and dance. Buy the live album (the white one with black writing... avoid the live in london double disc)... it captures a tiny bit of the energy he creates when he performs.buy the studio discs at your own risk. He releases a lot of them with old material. The old guy has to make money you know? I Love im."
2,OK,"I got this item so I can play my games better, but I realy do not like it. I like the magnifier and the light but the plaing buttons and joystick slowes things down. Sometimes the joystick does not react to the pad as well as my fingers. All and all it is an ok thing. I will be buing a screen only with light for my GBC."
2,wrong marker was sent to me,"the gun that got sent to me was a 98 custom pro with e grip and no anti-chop technology .I was disapointed in what I had got ,it was a gift for my nephew . So I gave him the marker . The marker it self is a good ,but not the one I ordered ."
1,DO NOT BUY,NOT as pictured at all. Teeny tiny pads that don't even have lines or places to make marks. Just plain paper with a Bunco logo at the top! Returning!
3,"Pretty good if you like ""Jeopardy!""","Let me start off by saying that no game show computer game can be spectacular or addictive. It just can't be realistic enough.But Jeopardy is about as good as a game show computer game can get. The questions are realistic (I think that they are actual show questions) and the opponents are tough enought to beat you more than half the time, if you want to set the difficulty high enough. That is my favorite feature of the game -- it is not too easy to win every time.Another feature that I like is that you can set the spelling strictness to the level that you like. It is rare that you get a question wrong because you misspelled the word. That is a nice feature.I haven't played the game enough to see the categories repeat themselves. That is a problem with every computer game of this type, and there is basically no way around that.I give this game a three, which is about the highest rating that I would give a game show game."
3,revision of my review,I was rushed to judge this company with so many things in my way. I was able to reconsile our differences and they took care of my business in a very proper manner.Sometimes we are caught up in to many other things to see what someone is saying. I apologize to all that may have been infulenced by my last remarks.They worked fast and diligently to fix the problem.Again my apoligies to 4 zip and to youBrenda
1,Jeopardy Patch for Windows ME,"Actually, there is a patch for this game online that supposedly fixes the Jeopardy game for use with Windows ME. Unfortunately, I can't get the patch to work, and the game still locks up at a certain point before game play begins. The patch can be found by going to www.hasbrointeractive.com and following the links to product support."
1,NOT what you think it is.,"This coloring book is only about 3 inches x 5 inches with 8 pages of very small pictures. The pages are black, with gray spaces to color that are too small for crayons. It would take fine point markers and a lot of patience to color any of the designs. Not for kids or teens for sure. Price said 25 cents each, but I was charged $1.50 each when my bill was processed."
1,Boring,I have listened to and enjoyed many of Babyface's albums and singles but have to say this is among the most boring songs I have ever heard. I actually threw it away.Not recommended.
4,Fair Price for the Product,"I was looking for a Bowler Hat for my Alex DeLarge Costume. It came on time and it is what I expected. Not an expensive real good hat to wear constantly, but has a fair price to be used as a costume.It is kind of hard, and fitted my big head perfectly."
2,Purchased for a Friend,"I purchased this for a friend, and he was not happy with it. He said it is out of date compared to the newer versions of Corel that are on the market. I suppose I should have checked more carefully. It is what it is."
4,A hearfelt CD,This couple is the real thing. Ramblin Man is the best I ever heard it.Not all the tunes are blugrass and some are old fasioned American standard ballad. All very high quality.
5,Another Great One,"This CD has a great mix of tempos. It has Rome's signature mating calls (""Take a Tour"" and ""Picture This""). There are some good dance cuts (""Do It,"" ""Doing Them Thangs"" and ""Can't Be Hating""). When I first listened to this CD, I was disappointed. I was expecting the same lineup of cuts as Rome's 1997 album. I had to listen to this CD a couple times before I realized just how good it is. BUY IT! You will be pleasantly surprise."
3,Just okay.,"I had high hopes for this book, but was disappointed as it was more of a romance novel than historical fiction, especially when compared to the series on Josephine by Sandra Gulland and the books by Phillippa Gregory."
3,It's ok,"I purchased this maples syrup for the Master Cleanse diet, which is great for that. I tried using on pancakes and the taste was not to my satisfaction. It's fine for the lemonade diet, but that's about it."
2,It's just a rehash,"For some reason, some producer thought it would be a good idea to take short clips of Foxworthy's best bits and repackage them out of context with an irritating music track as an underscore. You lose any sense of continuity, since you are hearing perhaps 45 seconds of a four-minute routine. This is not a ""best-of"" CD. Buy the full-show CDs."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,"Okay, okay... as with any ""Live"" recording, there isn't the purity of the studio. In my estimation, this is what really makes this a fantastic CD. It's Ian Tyson at his best, heard the way he should be heard, live onstage.If you're a fan of ""Nashville Trash"", give this a listen. Even friends who aren't C&W fans love this CD. Why, because it's a work of quality and of sincere passion. The best thing he's released since ""All the Good'uns"""
4,Very Good,"It's ok I get What I bought, a very nice Shoes, It's better when you receive it, cause physically they're better than in the screen..A recommended article"
5,Every once in a while!,"Every once in awhile you come across an artist you haven't heard before and the music just moves you. For me, this happened with Blackwater Surprise. The sound, the lyrics, the tempo, and the emotion just click on every one of the tracks. No gimmicks and no record company schmaltz here. Just honest, moving music from the heart. It's about as much soul as any white guy from rural Minnesota could ever hope to need."
5,A time machine made of musical notes.,"Wow, I had wanted this for a while. I had forgotten about it. I went to buy, but it was too much money. I got it off iTunes. Let me say it is amazing. I can remember the parts of the game the music is from. It kind of makes me sad to listen to this because when I was playing my parents were getting divorced. Also, the guy I played with died in 01. He was only 15 or 16. But, not everyone will have things like this to remember. If you have played the game you will probably remember each song and what you were doing the day you heard it in the game. Seriously, it's that incredible. If you have never played the game, that's fine. You will probably still enjoy this soundtrack. It has 4 disks that consist of 85 songs. iTunes has this for less than 30 dollars. If you want to spend more or know a place to get the CD for less then go for it."
2,Wobbles too much,"It is probably me but I secured this into a router table and when I tried running several practice boards through it, it seemed to wobble too much and created finger grooves rather than square box cuts. Like I said, it could be e but I had the board secured and the bit super tight."
3,More Potential than Execution,"Comparable to Lock Stock & Barrel, or Snatch. Lock, Stock.. would have been 4 star in my book whereas Snatch with or without B Pitt was still about 3 for me but that movie had its fans and if you were one of them you may like this as well. The acting is kind of low budget and over-exaggerated. Lots of violence, with a slightly humorous edge. The story, which initially attracted me to the movie, is better in synapsis than actual viewing experience I thought, but again, depends what you like. I've got friends that really liked ""Snatch"". Irish accents are thick (no subtitles on this U.S. edition) but it's understandable enough."
4,good boot,"I have own a pair of these boots for 2 years, have ridden cross country, walked all day with no trouble. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that they are heavy and if riding a goldwing as I do my ankle gets sore on all day rides where your foot bends. I use these boots for winter riding they are very hot boot in the California summers."
2,Big Letdown From the Book,"After reading the book, the movie leaves a lot to be desired. There were just way too many things left out of the movie.The film did have an exceptional cast, and the acting was terrific. I was somewhat suprised at how well Matt Dillon play Jan Erlone. The setting was pretty good too. The scenery was put together nicely, as it did look like the 1940's.Unfortunately, the editing from the novel made the film seem quite choppy. Having read the book, you got into the minds of the characters, especially that of Bigger's. The movie skipped over too many things, not allowing you to do this, which was a fairly big letdown.Not reading the book might leave you with a different impression of the film, because, once again, the acting is wonderful. But, having read the book, I couldn't enjoy the movie. Way too many important scenes were taken out of it. It is really not a good adaptation."
2,okay,"this game is just okay. its not as fun as i thought. a lot of the mini games are the same, just with a different background or something."
5,Rayman is family fun,My son is 8 and we love this game. We all play this and laugh. The rabbits are fun and the Disco gets you moving. Some of these games are pretty challenging so my husband and I go though and unlock levels in story mode so we can play in multiple player in score mode.Totally recommend this game.
4,Rabbids deliver,"What a hoot. Even my wife enjoys the shooting action. She is a better shot than I! My 11 year old enjoys so much, I forced her to shut down at 1 am nightly over the Christmas holiday. Too bad the later versions are not up to the task."
2,I hate the dancing game!!!!!,this game is basically a bunch of mini-games combined... some of the games are not too bad but some are just plain stupid... i think its terrible how u actually have to beat the games in story mode first before u can play them... the dancing game is terrible also... it wasn't too bad the first two times... but they you have to keep playing them... i'm on the third or fourth one and i'm just stuck because its hard to do the motions sometimes when you have 7-8 rabbits coming out all at once... i've been at this dance game for about half an hour and i'm stuck cuz i can't beat it... now i can't play the rest of the 82 percent of the game because i'm stuck at one part... this sucks!
1,It comes with that Icky feeling.,"Ok, I'm no goody-goody. I like the Sopranos, Tarantino flicks, and Quake 4.But there is something icky about the goal of a game that has a player repeatedly hitting a rabbid on the head with a hammer. Many people on this list say it is non-violent, but hitting ""animals"" (yeah I know they are possessed) with shovels, hammers, pulling worms out of their teeth and watching them hit each other with spiked clubs, well it just leaves me icky. Is this what ""E"" for everyone means?My kids don't like the game. It feels like a bunch of technical demonstration programs linked together. I don't think it's enjoyable either. It's going up for sale."
4,Lots of Fun but some of the Games are WAY frustrating,"I am very happy that I purchased this game. The story mode is very entertaining and the score more is even better as you challenge your friends, family members etc.The only downfall I see to this game is that a few of the mini games were EXTREMELY frustrating and if kids are playing (granted maybe they could just beat me in a second) that could cause some exasperation or shouting of choice words. I particularly went about crazy with the closing of the toilet doors!!!!Overall I would still purchase this game again just for the rhythm dance games and the opportunity to shoot cartoon bunnies w/ plungers.I'd say this is a must have for the Wii."
4,Pretty Fun!,My children and I really enjoy this game. We've played it before at a family members house and it was also highly recommended. We are having a fun time with this game!
1,World Wide Distributor doesn't actually carry the S video cord,"Title says it all - they picture and describe a S video cable, but they'll send you an RCA cable and claim it's the same thing. Don't waste your time, move onto a different vendor."
3,"Tight fit, but works","I got the item in a plastic bag and I dont mind that a bit, since it's new. What I'm concerned about is how tightly the cable fits in the Gamecube system and s video tv input. I dont leave my Gamecube pluged in because I always place my consoles in bags after use, for fear that a tiny insect might sneak under the lens, or even the housing itself, if I dont, and to prevent as much dust accumulation as possible. So the constant pluging and unpluging makes me wonder if I might loosen a solder joint, as the cable fits very tiight. Otherwise, it works, both av and svideo."
3,An epic of a story,"Sins is a compelling story, and worthy in a literary sense, but Jose's prose is more stilted than it should be, and this is a let down. Nonetheless, the story of Don Carlos is gripping, and an almost true-to-life account, it seems, of life at the upper echelons of Philippine society."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted the ""good"" ones I remembered from the TV program. Mr Magoo used to go through all kinds of antics, leaving mayem in his wake and then say ""By George, Mr.Magoo, you've done it again"" This set is re telling classic stories and basically destroying them. The one on Don Quixote De La Mancha managed to destroy any moral message in it and Dolcenaya and how he lifted her up is not even in there. So, I give it a thumbs down."
5,Highly Effective Mosquito Control Fog,"I've used this product for several weeks now, and I must say that it's considerably more effective than the Black Flag fogging solution that is commonly available. The mosquitoes that we have here in Florida are a pretty mean breed, and it takes quite a bit to kill them. The Hudson fog solution seems to do the trick. It's made of ""resmethrin"" rather than the pyrethrins that are used in most of these fogging fuels--namely, the Black Flag stuff. Definitely industrial strength skeeter killer! Highly recommended."
4,JOEY RAMONE'S LEGACY WILL LAST FOREVER,"I'll admit that I had low expectations from Joey's solo album. Wow, was I surprised! This album is a great, straight-ahead rock album, with no ballads and no filler. The musicianship, production, and songwriting are very good. Joey's singing is absolutely beautiful, the best he's done since the Ramones' 1983 album ""Subterranean Jungle."" Several of the songs stand out, and I find myself listening to them over and over - ""I Got Knocked Down (But I'll Get Up),"" and ""Don't Worry About Me,"" ""What a Wonderful World, ""Maria Bartiromo,"" and ""Mr. Punchy"" are also great. Ramones fans will definitely want to buy it, as it ranks up there with some of the Ramones' best albums. If you are not a Ramones fan, buy it anyway. You won't be disappointed."
3,"This is slow, but a good one","OH MY GOD CAN IT BE ANY SLOWER. I has running it on a Pentium II and lord was it slow. I like the game though. It is.... different. I have tryed playing as all the sects (Fed. Kling. Car. Rom. Fur.) and it is hard to get started, but then it goes okay until turn about 150. Then you just can't get a break. This is not a one day game it can take YEARS to play."
1,Horrible!!,"By far the worst text book I've ever had to use. Riddled with errors. Poor and incomplete explanations of complex subject matter. Examples and problems often with errors. Does lead the student into intense studying of content, if only to understand exactly what authors are saying and whether it is correct or not. Included software worthless except for limited use in solving problems in text.This book should be offered free to India, Japan, and China to give us an edge over their HVAC engineerng expertise."
3,Jack Clement at it again...,"Well, tarnishing Townes' first album, For the Sake of the Song, with overproduction and inappropriate arrangements was not enough for Cowboy Jack. No, he had to do the same thing, although in a little different manner, with different instruments, to At My Window. Before, it was mostly drums and percussion. This time Clement enlists the aide of the sax and flute and uses them in very distasteful arrangements. Almost every song after track 3 is marred. Clement should have learned his lesson the first time-Townes's songs should stand on their own. However, the poor production does not completely destroy the album and Townes songs still shine, albeit with just a little less lustre. While I wouldn't use this album to initate a new TVZ fan, it is still a welcome addition to the TVZ catalogue."
4,Nice...but not forever,"I bought this set for my daughter last Christmas (2008) when she was not quite two and it was an immediate hit. It's just the right size for little girls under 3, but you do have to be careful with those spoons for kids under the recommended age group (as you'd expect). Another caution--the pieces WILL break if they're dropped on a hard surface. The sugar bowl was the first to go when it fell off the pew at church. We lost a tea cup when it fell off the couch. And finally, we had to say goodbye to the set completely when my son (14 months) threw the teapot on the floor and it shattered. I still think this is a good toy...after all, we had it for over a year and were still playing with it regularly up until last week. But keeping it for tea picnics on the floor might ensure yours lasts longer than ours did."
2,Disappointed,"I did not purchase this move but I netflixed it. I enjoyed Sora Aoi's part in ""Man, Woman and The Wall"", so I thought I would try this. The synopsis sounded good and it holds true in the movie, but I was disappointed in the acting and the overall movie, I know it is a B movie, but watching it seems more to be a C movie, if they have C movies, this was a big disappointment and I would not recommend it."
4,Rabin gives boost to Yes,"A lot of die-hard Yes fans who absoultely hated Trevor Rabin didn't want to hear this or any of his other work with Yes but the truth is there might not be a Yes today if it wasn't for Rabin's genius,he plays every instrument except drums I believe, & produced 90125 ,Big Generator as well as the underrated ""Talk"".I personally enjoy every vesion of Yes as their very being makes them experimental if it be hard core prog, super polished power pop or love/hate ""Tales from from Topographic Oceans"",self indulgence,the bottom line is they never put out a bad album & realised the magical hooks in these demos presented to them @ a major turning point in their careers,clearly a good move & went on to sell major units without selling out."
1,Porn,"God.. if I wanted porn Id have gotten a movie or read Playboy. This book was nothing but porn interspersed with some mediocre attempts at a plot. Some warnings like *PORN AHEAD* would have been useful. BY chapter 8 I got tired of reading the same porn skit over and over. I ended up skimming the rest of the chapters, past all the 'rolicking' to find some actual literature.I doubt the author has ever read Jane Austin. Reading this book almost put me off Jane Austin altogether. I hope the author doesnt ever do another Jane Austin sequel again. If you are looking for straight porn then hey!! this book is for you! If you are looking for an actual authors attempt to continue in the authentic Jane Austin style then run! run away! And read something else."
1,TRASH!,"I applaud the people who actually finished this book. I got to page 30 and was severely grossed out. I'm sorry, If I wanted to read some lusty romance novel, I would have gone to the romance section and picked one out. How can this book be in the literature section? This is not literature, this is soft-core porn. GRR...I was deceieved. Dear Lord, every sentence was a description of some deviant sex-act.Pride and prejudice is more than a romance novel, it is an examination of human character and society. Man, I sound like I'm writing a book report..hahah.For P&P; purists and for people who are not fans of erotica or cheesy romance novels or even soap operas, Don't buy this book."
2,"not elizabeth, not darcy, definitely not austen","I don't mind the soft-core elements; I don't expect berdoll to ""nail"" austen; I do expect readable prose. Frequently, I had to parse sentences aloud two or three times, trying to pry the meaning out of serial double negatives or made-up words like ""consterntion."" The novel reads like a Georgette Heyer translated into Farci and back again."
1,I threw the book into the trash - NEGATIVE STARS,I am sorry I paid for this garbage. It was offensive and I threw it into the trash can before finishing it. I would not even give it away! Wish I could rate it five negative stars.The sex scenes were just gross and totally out of what even this permissive age should tolerate. I am too embarrassed even to post some of the most offensive.
1,So disappointed!,I bought this book as a birthday present to myself thinking it would be a wonderful sequel to Pride & Prejudice only to find out how disappointing it was. I was absolutely shocked that this book seems to be so obsessed with sex and although nothing was extremely graphic (at least the part that I read) it is absolutely uncalled for! I believe that Jane Austen would highly disapprove of this book. I disliked it so much that I couldn't even finish it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
5,The Best sequal,I absolutely loved this book. And I already have Berdoll's second sequal on preorder. I totally recommend reading this book if you're hooked on the life of the Darcy family. The writing is humorous and very Jane Austin-like. LOVED IT!
5,Delightful!,"Berdoll does Jane Austen proud! This is a thoroughly delightful and engaging book and I am thrilled that she's writing a sequel to the sequel!! Yes, Berdoll is a little heavy-handed in the beginning, but keep plugging through and it gets much better!"
2,Mr Darcy Takes a Wife,"If you are looking for a P&P sequel, save your money and do not buy this book. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book and I love reading sequels to it. I bought the book when it was titled The Bar Sinister and was very disappointed. Ms Berdoll doesn't remain true to Jane Austen's characters, writing style, or the era in which they lived and the sex in the book is unbelievable. It reads much more like a modern day romance novel and Jane Austen would be horrified. It could be a very good beach read (if you are looking for something trashy) but it doesn't begin to do justice to Pride and Prejudice."
3,I expected so much more.,"After being obsessed with Pride and Prejudice ( the movie, starring Keira Knightly 2005) I decided to read this book. I cant help but think that our Lizzy would never say the things she said in this book, she gave me the impression of a mousy, quiet girl, nothing at all like the Lizzy from the movie that i loved. Darcy sounded like a complete bore. I'm sorry but i expected more romance and a great adventure. I was very excited to see how the romance between Darcy and Lizzie would continue, but this book convinced me to just stick to my own inmagination.I haven't finish it, i hope to eventually. Not at all what i was expecting as a sequel.Darcy needs some sex addict therapy."
2,Conflicted!,"Having but recently discovered the subgenre of P&P variations, I'm very much enjoying reading all of them that I can lay my hands upon. I was conflicted about how to rate this one, really conflicted. I read it and for the first half of it enjoyed it immensely--as the ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" (or perhaps the ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"") of P&P variations, which is to say it was so exquisitely bad that I came to the conclusion it was intended to be a SPOOF of P&P variations. I laughed so hard my sides hurt. Sadly, after reading the second half, I concluded it was merely very bad writing, period, but gave it two stars in tribute to my initial enjoyment of the ridiculous."
1,Jane Austen would be ashamed,I don't think anything more needs to be said. How dare this author write about a character of Jane Austen. Disgusting. It should be against the law to turn classic literature into romance novels.
1,"Wost Jane Austen ""fan fic"" I've ever read.","I couldn't even finish this book, which takes a lot for me. I got about a third of the way through, skipped a couple hundred pages to see if it got any better, but only discovered it got worse and gave up. A love scene should not make you cringe and that is what many of the love scenes in this book had me doing. There were points where I actually said ""Ugh!"" outloud in reaction to what I read. The book is also very poorly written and I found all too often that I couldn't understand a word of what I was reading. I can't believe I wasted my money on this book, when I can read better fan fic on the internet for free."
5,Hold on to your bonnet!,"This book gives us Elizabeth and Darcy as the hot steamy couple we always knew they would be. The consistancy of the characters to all of Jane Austin's originals is on the mark. I really enjoyed meeting new characters and watching them interact with the ones I know so well. Things turn out typically for all the Bennet girls and their relations. Jane Austin would have blushed, I'm sure, but would have recognized the characters as her own. Well done and highly recommended for any Jane Austin fan -- Pride and Predjudice lover."
2,not jane austen,"i found this book to be about nothing except sex! the characters weren't even similar to jane austens except in name only. as far as charles bingley having an affair you could tell from reading p&p that mr bingley was devoted to jane bennett!!and as for mr darcy's sister climbing aboard a man that is too silly for words even if that man was her cousin who is 10 -15 years older than her.someone she grew up with like a brother. in p&p she was shy, reserved, and shaken up over the wickham affair, it's hard to believe that she could do that!! the book is well written, but the characters personalities are far different to the ones jane austen wrote about. it is a good story in itself, but i found it hard to relate the characters from this book to jane austen's, and found the ending silly. after reading over 400 pages to find it ends with wickham singing in the desert was enough to pull my hair out.all in all a good read, but no continuation of P&P!!!"
3,Mr Darcy takes a Wife,I thought it was a very romantic way of continuing on from Pride and Prejudice.
1,What the frecking heck???,"This is possibly one of the most disgusting travesty of literature I have ever read. Berdoll takes the immortal work of Jane Austen-with all her wit, and folds and gentle cynicsm, and turns the book into a badly phrased, sex romp, with descirptions that scream ""look at me! I'm trying to sound as fake as possible, but still make you think that your in the time of Jane Austen!"" I'm rather liberal in many senses, but (and think what you will of this), i think there are some things- some CLASSICS that just NEVER should be touched. I admire the obvious sencerity that this author has as she consturced this ridiculous work, but these books are just awful. Even if she wasn't adapting a classic, you are still left with a poorly constructed trashy novel, with oddly unreaslistic characters which are hard to sympathize with, which is little more then brain candy- it might taste good but it'll make you brain rot."
1,Darcy's Disaster,"I love the novel Pride and Prejudice and have read it so many times I can recite passages by heart. I also love the film versions, particularly the BBC version from years ago and the more recent A & E version, so I was intrigued by the idea of reading a continuing story.I could not have been more disappointed!This novel has absolutely no connection to Pride and Prejudice other than the names of the characters and the Darcy's home. It was a combination of a trashy romance novel and a snapshot of history, but with no plausible story. Nothing to care about, no real character development, no real story, no plot development - it was a vain attempt to use the names of Jane Austen's characters in a series of unrelated disasters that just seemed ridiculous.I considered this purchase to be a waste of money and I'm disappointed in myself for buying it."
1,Yuck!!!!,"I was very disapointed with this book. I've only read four chapters, and I want to vomit! It is pure sleaze. The characters are not the beautiful ones I remember, but vile oversexted morons. If you are considering buying this book, please don't it's not worth the paper it is printed on."
1,Unbelievably bad,"I don't mind the racy scenes. I know s e x wasn't invented in the 1960's.However, the book was badly written IMO. Key conflict points came out of nowhere, with no foundation laid for them. Traumatic turns of events like the revelations about Jane and Bingley need to be laid out gradually, with hints dropped for the reader to pick up on so that when the truth is revealed, it doesn't feel like an assault on the reader.I see the author has taken to posting replies to the negative reviews. Very unprofessional, also IMO. Haven't you heard that one of the reasons readers read is to get to know the author better? You're not making me eager to read another book from you."
1,Waste of Time,"I have just read 70 pages and will not waste any more time on this book. It just comes across as vulgar, and I don't know what to make of the language. I don't know how any Jane Austen fan would enjoy this drivel. Do not waste your money or time on this book!"
1,I actually felt physical pain readin this,"After reading P&P, I was desperate for more. I bought this on the reccommendation of a bookstore employee. I should have donated the money to charity instead. Beyond the fact that it strays so far from the characters as to render them unrecognizable, the book independantly is little more than a trumped up romance novel, complete with pulsing this and swelling that. If you'd like to get away with reading that sort of genre without having to read a book with an extremely tacky cover, then this book is for you. Otherwise, save your money."
1,Ugggh,"I'm not a nun or a prude by any means (in fact I've been in the field of sexuality ed for a very long time) but, ugggh! Too many badly written sex scenes, very very long. My copy had 100 pages missing near the end, and I was actually grateful! An unlikable Lizzy, a flaky Darcy and lots of lust. What's the rule now? If it's bad, make a sequel; maybe we'll get even more money...I actually threw this book away (something I have never ever done in my life; it was missing pages, after all), but I guarantee there's more than enough copies in circulation without mine. I'd suggest you borrow it--buy it if you like it. You won't be out the $$ if you don't."
1,Just plain bad!,Berdoll doesn't seem to understand Austen's work at all. This book cheapens what readers love about Lizzie and Darcy. The book is basically really bad soft porn. Run far and fast 'cause this book is just awful!
3,Passionate Exciting and way off track...,"This book is extremely passionate, and I believe that is why I enjoyed it as much I did. Mrs. Berdoll was completely off character in her portrayol of Elizabeth Darcy. She repeats many annoying words many times and takes phrases directly from the the 1996 A&E special."
2,Disappointed,"While I enjoyed being able to read more about the love between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy, I didn't enjoy the extremely dark paths that they were faced with on occasion. Very verbose."
3,Got my hopes up...,"When I saw that this book was coming out I thought that I would be getting a new story. I was VERY disappointed to learn that it was The Bar Sinister, repackaged as new. Although I enjoyed The Bar Sinister to a point, I was not too pleased with some of what Linda Berdoll wrote about the major characters. I certainly wasn't that happy with the book that I would purchase and read it a second time. Overall, the book was entertaining--but I recommend you take it with a grain of salt."
2,I just don't know...,"First of all, I like P&P;, but love Persuasion. I purchased this book thinking it would be in a similar vein as P&P;, but continuing on with their new life together. The first thing I was assaulted with was Elizabeth feeling sore from her first married night. Right then, I put it down and didn't pick it up for months! If there's ever such a thing as too much information, that is it. (I've read tons of romance novels, not just Georgette Heyer, but the real bodice rippers so I'm no prude.)The writing is so-so, but there is an excessive use of large words that is just not needed. If the writing is good, large words aren't needed and just pisses of the reader. Jane Austen didn't write like that. Also, all the terms to refer to body parts was far too romance-novely for me. Just got to the period part and ICK. Not sure if I'll bother reading more.I've read the JA mysteries and thought they were fun. This, however, is not."
1,I don't know whether to be throw up or cry,"This is terrible. I was so excited when I found this book; I never expected it to live up to P&P, but to call this a sequel is false advertising. The characters are not the same people. This is really soft-core porn wrapped up in a regency-era package. The plot is really nothing more than a vehicle to move you from one sexual encounter to the next. Additionally, the author's writing style is terrible. I've never read anything quite so pretentious and insipid. Don't waste you time or money, unless you want a few cheap thrills and a few moments that are downright gross."
2,A little too trashy...,"The beginning of this novel reads like a trashy romance; the author spends too much time on the details of the Darcy's intimacy. The story overall is not true to the characters, making Elizabeth way too fragile, and Bingley way too clumsy and then too permiscuous. The story may have been interesting had it not been a sequel to P&P, using these characters. I would not recommend it if you are looking to continue the P&P story."
1,The only book I ever returned to Amazon,"I agree with other reviewers- this was such a disappointment that I took the time to return it to Amazon, the only time in my life I have ever done so.My expectation when reading Austen-inspired works is not that they will equal her work, but that they will be enjoyable explorations of familiar and beloved characters. The characters in Berdoll's book bear no resemblance to Austen's characters beyond their names, the book itself- without the Austen connection- is unbearable to read.There are plenty of other Austen-inspired writers out there to try- avoid this one if you actually enjoy Austen's original work."
1,Disgrace to Civilization series,"This is just Civ 2... wrapped in a new box, with horrible (esp on new monitors!! argh!!) graphics, and renamed units, wonders, and improvements, along with an extremely confusing tech tree and nonintuitive ideas... The new worlds are a nice idea, but executed very poorly... I would say that this game is 90% identical to Civ 2...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! BUY CIV 2 GOLD MULTIPLAYER AS IT IS MUCH MUCH CHEAPER AND MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PATHETIC ATTEMPT AT A VIDEO GAME!!! See what happens if you try to make a Civilization game without Sid Meier..."
5,A Must for Every Marriage,Every Christian wife should read this book. This book gave practical ways to pray for your husband. A must-read!
2,For younger kids...,My almost 3 year old is too young for it and my 6 year old is a little old for it. I like a toy/game that can have a little more longevity.
3,"Ok, but my girls like other games better.","I have a 3 and a 5 year old both girls. I would say their most played games are Pet Pals, Kindergarten, Letters on the Loose, and Get Puzzled. We also have a Diego, a Princess, this Nemo, and an I Spy game that get occassional play. Seems like a good game, but they don't play it very much."
3,well done but I wanted medium rare,"Quirky, madcap cast of character, whose devotion to cooking really comes through in this book. Very insightful as to the goings on in a professional kitchen and the prima donnas that call them home. At times, however, the writing does seem a bit tedious and felt hard to digest. If this book was a steak it would be thick and flavorful but a bit overcooked."
5,HEAT,"I enjoyed this book because it felt as if I was being taken into the world of chefs and their assistants. Once I started the book,it was hard to put down. I enjoyed it so much that I passed it on to a friend who I felt would also enjoy the book."
4,"Fun, fun fun in the bowels of the kitchen","I read Bourdain's book and loved it. I also liked this one. Raw, honest talk from someone who has been there.The autobiography part was fascinating (can such characters really populate elite restaurants!?) and the lowdown on furiously making food night after night was priceless. The last section was too blah blah about Mario Batali, although the scenes of Italy were intriguing. A must read for real food lovers."
4,Talented Housewives need not apply.,"Heat was fascinating as it gave the amateur chef a look into the world ofof self-indulgent celebrity chefs and restaurants kitchens.Having us been to cooking school in Tuscany, I really loved the book."
3,Good but slow,I'm not an expert on this process but not sure why it takes weeks for a book to arrive. However arrived in good shape. Thanks!
3,I'm not quite as enthusiastic as others - A good read but if you read a lot of Food books there's not a lot of new territory,"I've never met a food book I didn't like - and the same is true with this one but I don't quite get the fawning reviews - to me the book can't quite decide what it wants to be. ....about Buford, about Batali, about Tuscany, etc. It's genesis as a magazine article shows - the chapters are loosely knit together with no over arching narrative. I found Ruhlman's Soul of the Chef somewhat similar - although it was mainly a three part book rather than a series of somewhat disconnected chapters as I found Heat to be."
3,Clutter-Free,"Some great ideas and some not-so-great ideas. Some of the simple ways are quite ""wordy"", while others are quite repetitive. Overall well-written and contains a lot of good information."
5,"honestly, clearly titled; and it delivers","if you have an enduring interest in elementary math in the real world, this work will not disappoint you."
5,Essential reference for a beginning student in math,"A must have for the mathmatically curious. The subject seaquence is laid out in a logical order. Beginning with the premises of inductive vs. deductive reasoning, basic algebra, geometry, and the Calculus. This is not a good book for becoming proficient in sepcific areas of mathematics, but offered for me at least, a logical reference point for approaching the core sujects. I highly recommend this book for self-study."
4,great game to play!,"This game is awesome to play. Only one downfall for me is that you CANNOT save your plays which sucks because you have to start all over again and again and that's a major problem. If you can fix that, then I will review again and give it 5 stars, but overall still a great game to play."
5,A Suspensfull High Level Thriller By Koontz,"A very well written high level thriller. Flows well through all the suspense. A scientific experiment with life extension using recominant DNA, a scientist comes back from the dead and well.. all hell breaks loose. Paperback with 509 pages, and suspensefull to the very end. Recommended great reading."
1,Long,"In the grand scheme of all books, Shadowfires does not rate a 1 star. But in comparison to Dean's other books, it is worthy of only 1 star (and maybe no stars). As others have mentioned, the leads are cookie cutter. Too many bad guys - Eric the ex, his business partners, the government agent chasing the leads. And the business partners storyline, which could have provided the most suspense, was wrapped up tight much too early in the book and with no satisfaction to the reader. This felt like the book editor told Dean to drop the business partners angle. But sadly the editor missed the mark - all of the details should have been edited instead.I highly recommend Dean, but avoid this book. Try Strangers instead."
3,ummm no,"I read this book a few years ago. It was pretty good in the start, then it got to be sort of corny. I liked Verdad and Hagerstrom's characters, but for some reason i just couldn't seem to care about Rachael or Benny too much. They always seemed one step ahead, and be warned, the back cover is a total lie. There were some pretty tight moments, and some very good action scenes as well, but in the end I still felt pretty bored overall. Not to say Koontz isn't a great author, I really liked THE VOICE OF THE NIGHT and TICKTOCK, this one just couldn't grab me in the same way."
2,Disappointed...,"Too bad I read ""Relentless"" first... This one is a repackaged/rebranded release of a pretty early work. Still kept me rapt all the way through, but I realized I was shaking my head at too much of the cheesy dialogue and it regularly challenged my own ability to suspend disbelief.Might be okay if you've read other greats of his (""Velocity,"" ""Seize the Night,"" ""The Good Guy,"" ""The Husband,"" so many!)...."
2,Pretty lame,"I tried the unabridged book on tape, featuring an utterly lackluster performance by Jonathan Marosz. Maybe I've read too much Dean Koontz, freak accident of science looses a monster with a special grudge. A resourceful man and equally plucky woman battle the evil while becoming soulmates. Characters exchange biographical information in unnaturally eloquent banter, providing exposition that would be much better conveyed by a third person narrator.The premise about genetic mutation was okay, and I liked the logic of his superheated cells devouring themselves at the end, but the clashes and chase scenes were dull and forgettable.If you're a new Koontz reader, maybe this is pretty good, but I have much fonder memories of ""Hideaway"" and ""The Bad Place"""
2,Too many inconsistencies,"I love horror books, and far-out stories. The premise of this book was great, but I personally found the execution to be flawed. There were a number of times where I would scratch my head and think, ""that wouldn't happen that way!"" - even within a fictional story, situations need to be believable.About halfway through the book I gave up reading it when the protagonist stated that she thought the 15 year old, drug addicted, hospitalized girl could ""handle"" the corporate executives who had just gunned down 2 police officers, but feared should would not be able to deal with the Government agent investigating the case."
2,You get what you pay for.,Very Very Very lightly constructed as well as cheap materials. It is a $5 flag. Just feel the description by the seller was generous and left my expectations high. Again I got what I paid for . No Canvas hemn.
2,"Great game, poor negotiations","All I have to add is that the other reviews (especially the Amazon one) is correct. The interface lags horribly, so it misses clicks, the computer doesn't wait around, and sometimes i never even see it's counter-offers before it leaves the negotiating table!The only redeeming aspect of this game is gunboat style, because it works fine without the negotiation part!"
4,Essential for Enthusiasts,"If you've got the Bob Bug (as I do) then this is an absolute treasure. Somebody captured Dylan at the Gaslight coffeehouse in Greenwich Village during 1962 with a portable tape recorder. Through the magic of digital technology, the tapes sound clear and balanced. The nuances of Dylan's vocals and guitar picking are a joy to hear so closely. At this point in time, Dylan had already seen the release of his debut LP come and go; he was working on the follow-up, ""Freewheelin'"", in fits and starts. So what you get here is an artist's work-in-progress on three originals and warm, intimate readings of folk standards delivered to a tiny audience in a small, dark room. The next ""live"" Dylan document is the Philharmonic Hall concert (Bootleg Series Vol. 6) of 1964. So, here it is ... pre-fame Dylan live in a coffeehouse on MacDougal Street in the Village. Short of a time machine, you'll never get as close to the real thing as this lil' round wafer."
4,"Very enjoyable, turned my head around","Although some might consider this statement heresy, I have to admit that I have long been a major fan of Bob Dylan The Rocker and less enthusiastic about the early folk stuff. Perhaps I am just getting older and wiser but lately I have begun to appreciate pre-electric Bob and this set has much to do with it.Gaslight really is like a time machine to another time and place and proves a very rewarding journey. As others have said, Hard Rain and Cocaine are really special but the whole set is a gem.One other thing: I often get cynical about the dubious necessity of ""Remastering"" that the record companies employ to sell us the same records over and over again. However, the state of the art audio technology employed for this release, the Zeppelin live CD and DVD from a few years ago, Kurt Cobain's cassette demo's from the Nirvana box and other recent archival releases truly is a wonder. Live At The Gaslight 1962 shouldn't sound this good, but it does."
2,Good..IF your pet has already been diagnosed by a vet.,"This book is alright if you already have a diagnosis from your vet. But trying to figure out if something is wrong in the first place (symptoms)is not happening. Or perhaps your dog just has dry skin and a sensitive stomach..there is nothing in the book that helped me for less serious conditions either. Needless to say, I ended up returning the book."
5,Natural Health Bible for Dogs and Cats,"Great book, reasonable delivery time, Im happy with the knowledge I am gaining from natural supplements for dog ailments to learning about their health ailments naturally rather than going to the vet all the time !!!"
5,mech warrior 3,"I have played this game MECH WARRIOR 3 for over 5 years it just gets better and better. My clan was the best only serious mature playerS who dont cheat.Game action is smooth fabulous GAME was made for serious PLAYER by SERIOUS PLAYERS. ON-LINE play is better than off-line play by many many times. Ive had games so intense i was sweating, what more can you ask? Mech warrior 4 isnt nearly as good and 3. I havent seen a better game created I suspect i never will. Oh yes the graphics will continue to evolve, but the game is tight responsive if you die its your fault. Well who doesnt die. Only way to learn is to get killed LOL I personally would play on-line again if i had the chance, once you get hooked on the best game ever made you will never completely forget the experiance. I LOVE THIS game, nothing else comes close!!"
4,MechWarrior III Rocks (except for the AI)!,"An awsome sequel to Mechwarrior II. Mechwarrior III does an incredible job with setting up missions, providing multimedia briefings, and developing an interesting storyline. The graphics are outstanding, the sound effects are good, and the gameplay is smooth. An excellent game which is well worth the cost.The only downside/improvement to the game would be better AI. The enemy mechs are easy to kill, and the missions aren't difficult enough. Why can't they learn from the AI engines from Quake or Halflife and create opponents which are truly worthwhile?"
5,"If you like penguins, this is the one...",This penguin is cuddly and lifelike. It put a big smile on a sad young lady's face.She keeps it close and it still makes her smile and think of me.
1,Utter Tripe,"This book is utter crud. It is not helpful and did not shed much light on my job search. I was expecting a wealth of diversity in cover letters and resumes, instead the book offered one framework for cover letters and that makes me mad."
1,"Don't bother, even for the low price","For the price, I might have accepted the noisy images, the blurry focus, and the slow response time when taking a picture. But the camera showed poor quality from the beginning, with a dim screen, flaky behavior when pressing the selector wheel, a battery cover that failed to stay closed, and poor compatibility with standard CF memory cards. Finally, within a year of purchase, the screen died and the picture counter failed.Oh, and the rebate that was offered at the time of sale was a scam. Lots of bouncing between Amazon and Polaroid before determining that the rebate was offered by the Polaroid distributer, whos non-toll-free number hangs up after five minutes on hold.All in all, the aggravation wasn't worth the difference in price."
3,New Drivers for pdc-1100 and 1300,"To the previous reviewer, did you see new drivers to make PDC-1100 work with Windows Me, 2000, and XP Home Edition? It is under customer service - downloads."
2,"Good products, very bad service.","I have a Polaroid PDC-640 and for good reason I planing change to a new camara. Polaroid have good camaras depend on the what you will use it and how much quality and/or needs you look on photos. But I read a review here that I agree. Polaroid DO NOT give support for costumers who buy they camaras. Why? simple.. when I buy my PDC-640 work fine and I like it, but when the digital LCD screen begin to have problems, I take it to the service department directly and they say ""Sorry, we dont repair or give service for any of our digital device"" uhm... that is bad. and I have friends that bring the digital camaras too and photo printers for service and they get the same answere.What this mean? Polaroid made good digital equipment like the photo printers and digital camaras, but in the moment you need repair or service. careful, you can get a terrible nightmare on that."
4,2nd Review - Still loving it after 6 months,"After six months I am still very pleased with this (my first) digital camera. It's fun and very easy to use. I've dropped my rating by one star, though, due to battery consumption. 4 standard AA alkaline batteries will only give you enough power for 10 pics, sometimes less than 5 with the LCD display on. If you don't want to invest in rechargables (I'm the type who forgets to recharge them), I've found that Energizer Photo Lithium AA or comparable batteries give a very, very long life and are well worth the $ for a four-pack. Always remove batteries when not using the camera for more than a day, because it will drain them over long idle periods. I also strongly suggest a 16MB flash card for the average user. (See my previous review from 11/30/00 under jeffandcoy for more info.)"
1,This Camera doesn't work with Windows 2000!!!,"I bought this camera last fall and was satisfied with its average performance (after I had to send the first one back as it was defective). However, approximately 3 months after I bought the camera, I purchased a new computer with Windows 2000. This camera does not work with Windows 2000! It states what the MINIMUM requirements are for the camera but doesn't tell you it WILL NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 2000. How disappointing! Now I have a camera that is worth absolutely nothing to me...and to top it off, when I called Polaroid, they just tried to sell me a card reader for it for $125. What a rip off!"
4,Interesting.,"I found several interesting parts to take ideas from. The writing style is good and I enjoyed reading it. My mother is in a nursing home following a fall that injured her brain and took away her short term memory as well as her memories of the last 65 years of her life. It is a very tough situation for her and for me, her daughter. She knows me only if I am there to see her otherwise she claims she does not have a daughter if asked who I am or if she has children."
2,GOLDEN RETRIEVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Uh... yeah... choosing the perfect GOLDEN RETRIEVER for you and your family. The review for the Cairn Terrier in the book (a breed I like) makes it sound like they are snappy, enerjetic, and tough guys. 'He's not a big boned tower of pateince. He can't take the indiscriminate pounding some very small children might mete out.' Shetland Sheepdog: snappy, annoying little breeds that be scared of cars if never exposed. Yeah, that's with all breeds. It never mentions their trainability-they're one of the smartest breeds. And they say that they are bad and poor if treated badly! 'Train them easily and gently and you can maintain their sweet temperaments.' The Golden Retriever review (not that I don't like them) talks about how they are the best family dog, are easy to care for, and are just the best, best, best dog ever! I some other reviews it also says that you shouldn't get this breed- get a Golden Retriever. That is mean to other breeds and their breeders!"
5,Absolutely the Best!,Back Stairs at the White House is one of the finest presentations my family and I have ever watched. It is well worth the price and is exceptional entertainment.
5,I would purchase this again,This is an oldy but a goody. If each person could see this you would learn the History of each President and enjoy it thru a childs eyes.I hunted for this for years and it is NO disapointment it is great and entertaining at the same time.
2,Sadly Disappointed,"Having heard much about this composer, I was finally persuaded by one of the reviews here and ordered ASYLA. I've listened to it numerous times and have to finally conclude there's nothing really new or fresh, or enjoyable or profound to be discovered here. It struck me as imitative of Michael Colgrass--and not engagingly so. I'm glad to have it in my collection, but I'm afraid I will rarely give it a listen. Perhaps I was anticipating too much, hence my disappointment--but I'm far more likely to pull out Colgrass's AS QUIET AS if I'm after inventiveness."
4,Overall well done,"When I first wrote a review for this book I was kind of skeptical. Now that i have owned it for a while and completed a couple of the projects I am editing my review because I like it more than I thought! I made the skirt from page 114 and it is my favorite thing I've ever crocheted. Candi is great at giving precise instructions, and the designs can be easily modified."
2,Love Christensen did not love author,"Being a large fan of Hayden Christensen, I pounced on the chance to read a biography on him.However, I must say, I was very dissapointed! Though there were some nice photographs of Christensen, the author published this book before Star Wars came out, which I thought a mistake, because everything the author said was a perdiction!Other then that, the author made everything too brief and talked more about his Star wars movie then the rest of his life. I was sad as the author went into painstaking detail on lightsabers, and yet said only a paragraph about my favorite film of his, ""Life as a House."" Overall the author used fair language, and for the most part Hayden Christensen deserved a better biographer. Maybe I will try to some day!"
2,Great for a First Aid Kit,"I got this for my first aid kit. To my surprise it comes in its own self contained carry case and has covers (5) too. Unfortunately the covers do not fit in the case with the thermometer but it appears to be well made, will store previous readouts, comes with written instructions that make sense and just plain works great. I got the flex tip since it was for my mobile bag but the Led is large and it only takes 10 seconds to get a reading and yes the tip really is flexible.Update: The beeping sound is so low that it can't be heard most often. I have found no way of turning it up. So you have to count to 10 then get your reading the beeper is too low."
5,super fast,"It's a super-fast thermometer! I have used it only once since it has just arrived, and it gave results within 5 seconds. It looks accurate, although there is always a debate of how accurate is accurate, since what you compare with might not be accurate either. It also has 5 probe covers in the box for taking body temperatures. In any case, I am impressed with the product."
1,Only reads 97.1 or 97.2,"Don't bother, it's not worth the price. This thermometer only reads two temperatures, 97.1 and 97.2. Completely useless, and a waste of money at any price."
5,a head-on collision of napalm death and cannibal corpse,lowbrow sounds like a head-on collision between napalm death and cannibal corpse. buy this if you like both bands or if you're a die-hard metalhead.
3,"great value, ok quality","The goggles work great, they are pretty dark when the lenses are down. They tint everything red, some technicians like that and some don't. The plastic frame is a little uncomfortable, but for the price they are worth it."
1,waste of money,"Did not meet my expectations. I enjoy bellydance DVDs where the instructor is in tip top shape, flat abs, and dressed in bellydance costume (at least in performance portion if not in practice sessions). This DVD failed my test. I couldn't even watch more then 5 minutes of the various chapters. Would return but for the fact that only receive 50% of purchase price since DVD open and it cost at least that to return it."
1,Lousy product,"My child received the indian arrowhead ""Dig"" kit. It is terrible. My husband had to resort to the garden hose to get all the muck off the ""artifacts."" We were left with a clay mold that is all one piece--frame, background and molded in arrowhead shapes.It is a fragile clay, easily cracked and chipped. (If you drop it, I expect it will shatter.) The clay keeps rubbing off on towels and countertops. My son wasn't even interested in painting the thing."
3,Improve you reds!,"These little aerating funnels work great! Buy a $10-$15 dollar bottle of red wine, decant it through one of these funnels, wait 10-15 minutes and enjoy a greatly improved product! It's amazing. I do taste tests with guests comparing the same wine (decanted vs. straight out the bottle) all the time and the verdict is always the same!!!! The decanted wine is MUCH better!The only thing I do not like about this aerator is that the filter screen on the bottom is small and is loose, so there is a greatly increased chance of losing the screen. Also, the stand it comes with requires you to delicately balance the aerator on it's stem."
1,Second time for repair in 2 years,"I bought this new from Sam's Club and was thrilled for about three months until the set needed the mother board replaced. Well VIZIO sent a repair person out at no cost as I live in Southern California and the TV was under warranty. However, now that the warranty has expired (perhaps four months ago). the main board overheats and you can only watch the TV for about 30 - 40 minutes at a time until it cools down. Unfortunately, it has no room for anti-freeze. I'm going to call VIZIO and ask how much it is to repair, however my policy has always been never to throw good money after bad. So I guess I'll be dusting off that old tube TV which works just fine and wait till after New Years, or until China invades."
5,"This is the first album I bought, it rules","this was the first album I ever got, and i loveit.the videos Suck entirly but the music is great. An added bonus isthat it comes with 4 stickers showing the Hampsters. I love this Cd. If you are just beginning to like The Hampsters, get this.it is an easy way to start liking them."
3,Tracklist,1. The Main Event (Radio Version) (ft The Cella Dwellas)2. The Main Event (Street Version) (ft The Cella Dwellas)3. The Main Event (Instrumental)4. Everyday Struggle (Radio Version) (ft D.V. alias Khryst)5. Everyday Struggle (Street Version) (ft D.V. alias Khryst)6. Everyday Struggle (Instrumental)
4,good charger and prompt delivery,"My notebook's battery charger was broken so I bought this charger. It works fine, and the only thing I did not like is the weight and size of the charger. I guess Toshiba did not expect people to carry this charger when they travel.There is a big variation of the price for this charger- anywhere from $20 (on eBay) to more than $250, I bought this for around $50."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased these pads for use on chair legs to keep a newly polished hardwood floor from getting scratched up. Unfortunately, the adhesive on the bottom of the pads fail after about two weeks and the pads are all over the floor. But a shot of spray adhesive helps them to stay put."
1,THE i705 DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY SAY IT DOES-Get the Blackberry,"I was very happy when I first bought this unit..i did everything i wanted! Then after about 2 weeks, i stopped getting email notification and now have to hit ""get mail"" everytime i wanted to check my email..so much for instant notification and ""always on"" email. After at LEAST four LONG calls to customer support and with them unable to explain the problem, they REFUSE to replace my unit, claiming that ""notification is not guaranteed"" which is supposedly in the fine print of the user agreement....The lack of customer service has been unbelievable...i am now exploring further action. Save yourselves the trouble...get the blackberry"
2,Not bad when it works...,"Long-time Palm user. I enjoyed the i705 right out of the box. Great Web clipping apps, etc. Email works well. The new mini keyboard for typing short messages is far faster than using the stylus - like a Blackberry but with real Web applications. In short, it would be a gem, if only....Well, one problem is that the alarm code is faulty. What good is a PDA that doesn't signal you when you're going to be late for a meeting??? ...Also, the screen could be better. In some lighting conditions it's just unreadable - backlit or not.I recommend that you Amazonians out there wait until they've worked out the kinks. The rest of us pioneers are living with the arrows in the back - we only hope that Palm gets it right.... soon.... please"
1,Inferior,"I received the i705 for Christmas. I have had nothing but trouble with the product. The Infrared radio didn't work. I tried for several weeks! The absolute worst part , however, was Palm's customer service. If you think they are out there to help you, you are wrong. They agreed (after several phone calls), to replace the unit. This was a new unit that they finally agreed to replace. After reading the fine print, I realized they were going to send me a reconditioned unit, and by now, there are better products on the market. Curiously enough, the unit still hasn't arrived. Additionally, you need to sign up for their service, which is pricey. If I have to have a reconditoned unit, I may as well have the top of the line reconditioned PDA. The price on this unit has come down considerably, I guess there is a reason. Oh, and the customer service department may be suffering from post Christmas stress, as they were a bit touchy, to say the least."
3,"A stirring read, but..........","This book was good, don't get me wrong, but as a teacher, I can't think of a single child that I would give this book to to read. I think parents would be banging my door down at school. Not only was the main character sexually abused, he talks about it throughout the book (but not in detail...it's implied by what he says). A pretty good mystery that I figured out early-on, may not be solved early by some readers. Personally, I found this book to be disturbing and that is why I would probably show great reluctance to recommend it to kids in my classroom."
3,Have used this many times for workouts in the pool,"but it seems that every workout is 2400 meters or greater. That is the only comment that I have. Other than that, super resource that explains the drills and workouts. It has helped me improve my swimming endurance."
4,excellent but slow,I loved the book it was in excellent shape. however it took so long to get it that my book study in my class was already over and I no longer was in need of the book. I will put the book in my library with the rest of the booksfrom the book study for the next time I use this study.teddyteacher
4,Good product for the money,I didn't want to spend too much money on a hair straightener. I read all the reviews before I purchased it. It heats up fast and has a digital display for the temperature. I have think hair and it straightens my hair without any problem. The temperature buttons are placed on the top of the straightener and sometimes I accidentaly push them while using it. Not a big deal. I got used to holding it without pushing the buttons. Great product for the money. I would definitely buy again.
5,5 Star plus for the Buggy Boo,We all celebrated this product for our most precious. It was the magic sack when lil' Buggy Boo started fussing.
2,Boring...really boring,"I just love Jamie and Claire but will leave their story to my own imagination. First this book is boring, second, I had to skim and skip over way too much - and third I just can't continue on this adventure with them in their 50's."
4,Excellent,"Was a great book. I loved it so much I could hardly put it down. I am a romance fan. This is a must read if you are also a romance fan. If you like this book I think you would also enjoy ""Stolen Moments"" by Barbara Jean Fisher."
3,Peaks and Lulls,"If you loved Outlander, you just have to continue reading the series. However, I find that usually it's when couples meet that is the true magic of falling in love. Once they're already together, it can become somewhat boring. That's exactly what happens in Dragonfly in Amber. There are long lulls about mundane things, punctuated with some exciting event, which makes you continue to the next chapter. If you love the characters, it's definitely worth reading, but it's no where near as good as Outlander."
2,Big Disappointment!!,"With a recommendation from the ""Borders"" staff to read, Outlander, I was thrilled to find a new series of historical fiction that was so engrossing! When I completed Outlander, I was sure that I would read the entire series, but I am so disappointed in Dragonfly in Amber, that I am seriously contemplating dumping the book! Disjointed, rambling, overly long and lacking in the flow and adventure of ""Outlander"", I believe I should have skipped this one. Don't know if I will go to the next book in the series. It seems to me that this author rambles on for hundreds of pages and then the last 100 pages or so are moving and thrilling. Sorry, Diana--you lost me. More (longer) is not always better!"
5,"Jamie, Jamie, Jamie","I will never marry again unless it's to Jamie Fraser!!!:)What a wonderful escape this and the other books in the series are. I don't read romance novels, fantasy novels, or much historical fiction, but these are some of my favorite books. Enjoy."
5,One of the Best Books in my Personal Library!,"A woman in my local bookstore recommended this to me because she said it was ""very historical."" I certainly didn't know what to expect when I opened it, and I still can't adequately descirbe any of these books to someone who hasn't read them.I re-read this this summer, since I have been in the process of moving half way across the country and changing jobs, house, etc., and I felt that I needed the comfort of a well loved book. This sis not disappoint on the second time through. The power of the relationships and the pull of the history--this is a very historical book, I'll agree--stays with you. Jamie and Claire are in a very small group of literary characters that I would like to know--genuinely decent, interesting ficitonal people."
4,"A little long, but hang in there","This book continues the story of Claire and Jamie Fraser. The story takes them to France, where they become aquantied with several people who show up in history books. Bonnie Prince Charlie, a Pretender to the Scottish Throne, is attempting to mount a rebellion. Claire, with her knowledge of how things end, attempts to halt the course of events that would lead to disaster for the entire Scottish people. A good book, a bit long and dragging in places, but once you get past them, things move pretty quickly."
5,A 15 out of 10!,Even better than her first novel! Ms. Gabaldon has a way of transporting you along with Claire Beauchamp-Randall-Frasier to 18th century Scotland and France. The commonplace becomes extraordinany in her hands and the extraordinary becomes instantly believable! Everyone MUST read this novel! NOW!!
2,What happened?,"I made it about half way through this one and i was bored out of my mind most of the time. Thats 350 pages so its not like i didn't give it a chance. I keep telling myself i'm going to pick it back up, that I probably stopped reading right when it gets good but i'm not sure i can. If i have to read about another dinner party or chess match or deciphering of letters my brain might explode from the tedium. I absolutely loved outlander but this one was too slow for me. In outlander there was very little downtime where as in this one it seemed thats all there was. Maybe I'll finish it someday and have a different opinion but until then i think I'm being generous with the two stars. Its a shame, really."
3,Poor recording quality plagues the CD....,"Maybe the person mastering the recording had a bad day, but I found it difficult to listen to, even though I enjoy alot of the music. Also, the magic of the Storytellers series is lost, because they omitted the artist's telling the stories. The stories are printed in the liner notes. Jewel gives a very good romp in ""Who will save your soul"". John Popper of Blues Traveler does a very interesting piece, which is an open letter to Satan regarding Steven, a childhood friend who had several tragic moments in his life. ""Rain King"" is excellent! With all of these wonderful tracks, it is a shame the recording wasn't mastered very well. I have relegated the disc to my work desk, where it plays through cheap computer speakers. I would have rated it much lower, but the content it very good and is the only saving grace of the disc. Audiophiles need not apply, as you will be utterly disappointed."
1,writing skills,"I think Mr.Williams touches upon a few very interesting topics. He has apparently read the works of several authors in his admirable quest to learn unusual,controversial points of view. However, with all due respect to the dignity and intelligence of this author,I must say that I have never in my life come across such a poorly written work as this. The entire book is plagued with an atrocious number of spelling errors, rambling thoughts, and poorly worded, gramatically incorrect sentences. I think, Mr Williams, with proper training, could develop the capacity to be a truly professional writer. His energy, motivation and apparently impeccable self esteem will truly be his greatest asset. I wish him all the luck in the world; but, in my opinion, this book should be viewed as an absolute disgrace by both author and publisher."
3,A pretty book,"I'm newly to soap making, trying to work up nerve to actually make some cold process soap. I've done several batches of melt and pour soaps -- adding color and scents -- and have been reading up on soap making. .This book has some stunning pictures, some really interesting ideas for soaps that are attractive, trendy, pretty, fun, different, all in a 'project' format.It has information in the front on the basics of 'making' melt and pour soaps, packaging them, etc. A good 'idea' book,it may not be practical for someone who wants to make batches of soap -- each recipe is for a bar or two.On the other hand, for someone who is looking for ideas and small projects, this has a lot of ideas.If you are seriously interested in learning about soapmaking - even melt and pour soapmaking -- this almost has too much glitter and glam.A great gift book."
3,Aptly Titled- Not for delicate ears!,"Bucket-Boy truly approached composing the soundtrack for Hades with this one. Chaotic, brutal, dissonant, punishing, dark, and frenetic, are just a few of the many possible adjectives to describe this work. I truly admire his guitar heroics on the CD, but I like a bit more variety and dynamics. This album at times becomes a blur of brutality and viciousness. There are amazing licks and solos, however, so that's why I give it at least 3 stars. He really has a gift for melody and groove, and that gift is put on the shelf for this hellride. I don't recommend it for other than the hardest core of Buckethead fans or horror flick fanatics. Use with caution."
4,GUITAR GOD!!!,"Buckethead had done it again.This CD is totaly amazing!Think of bucketheadland2 without the stupid comentary, more dinamic sreading and kickass drumming.It has bucketheads mindblowing solos and amazing song writing.Buckethead is one of the best guitar players of all time!"
2,"""If I Can Let You Go"" is Great--the Rest: Ehh","Ok, so the show is pretty bad overall. Yes, yes, everyone who is in lurv with Adam Lambert talks about him. He's actually pretty Ok in this. My Pesonal Favorite, though, is ""If I Can Let You Go"" between Bithia and....the Queen of Egypt? Who knows what her name is? I don't. I only know that listening to it is Great. Watching some dumb Rubber Baby go riding down the stage? Ehh, not so much.Anyhow, that's my review. Don't waste your money on this flop! Just watch it on Youtbue for free. Listen to the brilliant Bithia and her Egyptian counterpart. Skip the rest.Oh, yeah, Val Kilmer. Excuse me while I take my No-Doze. Again, not so much. He did a good job as the voice of someone from ""Prince of Egypt"". Was it Moses? Yah, it was Moses. That was a Good Moses. The all singing Moses? Again, Eh."
2,Autobiographical approach,This book was an autobiagraphical approach as to who one man learned. In this way the book was not what I anticipated. I thought thst I would be reading a book about techniques not how one internalized techniques. The below book was what I found more helpful. Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior).
4,It's working!,I've suffered from breakout all my life and tried many things. So far the blemish control bar seems to be working. I've had fewer break outs and the skins complexion seems to be improving. I've also use PCA clearskin too.
5,Marty Fan,"Busy Bee Cafe is a wonderful record. It highlights Marty Stuart's fabulous instrumental abilities. The record includes Johnny Cash, Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson, Merle Watson and many more. I enjoyed Marty's vocal contributions as well, he sounds great on Busy Bee Cafe. His voice is young and not as strong as he is now, but very enjoyable. I was surprised to see the other reviewer say he did not like The Pilgrim. I think The Pilgrim is Marty's best work and a first rate record."
5,Deliciously Scary,"This is the second book I have read by Mz.Elliston. I was so surprised to see how very different it was from her first book. One thing is for sure, she continues to weave fact and fiction, adding to the fear factor in this book. I loved how the story again takes you through time, dealing with good versus evil, and things that go bump in the night. The characters work great together. Andy had me laughing all the way through, and I admired Briana as a strong female lead. Mephistopheles is so chilling, I can no longer sleep with my closet door open! I especially like the fact that suspense rules this book over the usual blood and guts that most horror novels rely on to make them scary. My main suggestion, when you read this book, don't do it at night! Brilliant!"
4,Leicester Bangs Review (1997):,"Low - Long Division (Vernon Yard)Available in the States since 1995, ""Long Division"" finally gets a UK release. And very welcome it is, too.Hailing from Duluth, Minnesota, where the winters are bleak and unforgiving, Low make music to warm the soul. These slow, beautiful songs draw you into Low's grey winter world, where they permeate through like ghostly spirits from the past. Glorious understated melody oozes from every track on this haunting record, leaving the listener relaxed and rejuvenated. You simply feel better for listening to it."
4,Complex and Intelligent: not aimed at the Lowest common Denominator,"A good read and full of the internecine (and very real) politics of security agencies; and their lack of trust of each other. A good woman lead as a middle level intelligence officer, with good obervation and analysis, and suffered the reality of stress unlike many other fiction 'heros'. This book is not a 'shoot em up with untarnished heros and it does not shy away from the nastier side of rendition and torture cotracting by the CIA."
1,Has a knack for corrupting save files,"I bought the gameshark for the N64 because I wanted to do all that crazy stuff like levitating and having infinite everything. That part is great about the Gameshark, but using it on Glover destroyed all the save data and I was unable to save the game after using the Gameshark on it. I also used it on Donkey Kong 64, where the cheats did not even work, and even worse, destroyed my file (which I was almost done with). I had to play the game all over again which upset me a lot. It did work for some other games and did not destroy the game data, but after those two incidents, I wasn't going to use it again. I disliked the Gameshark so much that I just threw it out rather than giving it to someone, so their games don't become corrupt.If you don't care about ruining your files and just want to have fun with the cool cheats, this is for you. If you spent over 30 hours playing a game and do not want to have it lost, don't get this."
3,O.K. Let's Cheat !!!!!,"The game shark pro is awesome ! If your tired of getting stuck right before the end of a level, OR running out of ammo to fast WELL then you should get one. It can make you invincible, invisable, give you all guns, infinate ammo, and more! bEST OF ALL YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN CHEAT CODES !! HOWEVER MINE BROKE WITHEN 3-4 MONTHS OF PURCHASING IT."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This thing is nothing but trouble. It doesn't always work, but when it actually does, it only works for one of the games I have. It is very helpful for that one game though. But overall, it is a big waste of your money, time, and effort!"
1,bad news,I used my friend's game shark on one of my games. When I tried to play without it I found that all of my files had crashed. Many of my friends experienced the same difficulty. I don't think it should even be allowed. Consider yourself warned.
5,The Best Hacking Tool on the Market!,"If you want the best gaming experience, try the GameShark Pro. It is consideribly better than the regular GameShark, and, of course, is available in many different platforms (Play Station, N64, etc..) I especially enjoyed the GameShark with GoldenEye 007, since there a lot of places you're not supposed to get to."
3,Is this really a model with a DVD Recorder?,"Is this really a model with a DVD Recorder? The title and image would seem to indicate that it is, but the model number and product description sound more like a refurbished Homax T800, not a model that has a DVD recorderI suspect that it's not a DVD recorder model. Still, it's a pretty good deal at about $30.00 after rebate."
1,"Purchase at your own risk, you cold be SORRY!",We purchased this item and we were pleased UNTIL IT STOPPED WORKING. This was the beginning of an expensive nightmare. We finally decided that the lid was expensive but that we had no use for a 13 gallon stainless steel trash can without a lid. We ordered a new lid according to the item number in the manual we received when we purchased can. There was no item number on the lid or the can and there was only one option for a 13 gallon trash can. When we received the lid it did not fit. We returned it and our return has been denied. They say we were to get a return number and we did not return the item within the allowed time. They have the lid and our money. WE HAVE NOW PURCHASED A NINE STAR AND IT OPERATES WELL AND WE RECIVED TWO CANS FOR THE A PRICE WE PAID FOR THIS ONE.
2,Good seller,"Didn't know how to use this product, guess this was an impulse buy for me but seller shipped it quick and it came as described so that is all that matters i guess."
2,Accidental CD,"My son got this after seeing the ads on TV. I feel bad for him and want to trash this one and buy others, which would be a first for me. There are a few songs that are worthwhile: ""Yellow"", ""All or Nothing"", ""Help Me"", and ""Straight Up"" (but why is ""Straight Up"" on a ""current"" CD?). I wish we had saved our money."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,This book while has some great bird houses does not really give much of directions on how to build them. It mostly gives some dimensions and some pictures but doesn't really explain how they go together. I would consider myself an intermediate woodworker but a little direction would be nice. I would not suggest this book to a friend.
2,Too fine for loose tea,"I was very disappointed when this tea arrived. It is too fine to use in most of my tea making devices, and that is disappointing. It seeped through 3 different infusers, making the tea not-drinkable. I was able to make it using some paper t-sacs, and it tasted pretty good. I just prefer my loose tea to be in leaf form, like the Twinnings Earl Grey is. Because I prefer using infusers and I hate using t-sacs, and I didn't pay much for it, I'm sadly considering dumping it out and using the tin to store other tea."
2,Misleading,"As much as I enjoyed reading about the good work of Father Judge and about his life's struggles, this book seems to deliberately mislead or confuse readers about Catholic teaching. The author fails to explain correct Catholic teaching about such issues as General Absolution, Canon Law, and Homosexuality or same sex attraction. For this reason it is a disservice to Father Judge's memory, the Franciscans and to readers."
2,Podium for the Author,"Michael Ford has written a book hurriedly with a distinctively personal point of view that does not do justice to Mychal Judge. It is obvious that Mr. Ford's intent was to get the book to market and further along a media frenzied with the opportunity to ""out"" Father Judge after his death. We are left with snippets of a life that must have been overwhelmingly dedicated to others. There seems to be so much to investigate and develop that is left untouched in Mr. Ford's rendition. I hope that the next volume is truly ""authentic"" rather than an open ended quest for furthering an author's personal quest."
3,Small tray,"This is only 7"" x 8"", but is sturdy and works. You can only fit one slice of pizza on it so don't expect much."
2,Not reccommended,"The first one of these I received fired three nails, then jammed fatally and would not fire another at all. Amazon sent a quick replacement. This one functions, but almost never sets the nail head below the surface...even at the max pressure of 100psi. If all you'll ever shoot are 1"" or shorter brads, this may be an inexpensive way to do so. But if you want a nailer that works the way it's intended, look elsewhere."
3,comandos elite special forces,"guys!...most of the dvds I buy,are to be sen in the future, and this is one of them. so I buy asuming that it is a good movie"
1,stay away,"Stay away from this product. It is terrible, it does not gives any in dept information about any of the elite forces it talks about. Actually it just gives you a list of elite forces names that you can find in the internet. STAY AWAY!!!!!!"
2,Weakest entry of all.,"Unfuuny, rahter pathetic entry for A+C; an inept version of the Cole Porter hit."
3,Talk About Suffering,"This duo is a winning one but one song has stayed with me for years. They sing 'Talk about Suffering' without accomaniment and their voices simply ring. I've sung this song as a lullaby to my children at bedtime, it's just that memorable."
3,Still Holding My Own,"This book was okay. But, when you start reading it, you will want to finish it.It's about a young man at the age of 19 working as a prison guard. He gets involved in sex scandals and prison riots. Upholding your own in this kind of work is pretty tough."
4,Cute fun toy :),"My 2 1/2 month old son likes to look at Allie, and loves it when I pull her tail because it vibrates and ""purrs."" Her arms and legs crinkle, and the ball jingles. Overall, it's a great toy, but I think he'll get more use out of it when he's a little bit older. I highly recommend any toy made by Lamaze because the quality is great, and the toys are fun and educational!"
4,Great TPB,"If you like Alan Moore's work, you'll love this one. It features a lot of the themes that he would continue to work to perfection in Miracleman, Swamp Thing, and ultimately the Watchmen. It's definitely not Moore's best, but it's better than 95% of graphic novels out there. The stories here are reprints from old Marvel UK comics which were then printed in 'X-Men Archives' #2-7 a few years back, none of which I have.On top of this, Alan Davis' artwork is fantastic. Not nearly as clean as his later work, including his great runs on Excalibur, the artwork really works with Moore's writing."
2,"HMM, NICE TRY...",THIS MOVIE WAS NICE TRY TO MAKING IT BUT IT'S NOT SATISFIED. THIS MOVIE WAS FAILED AND IT'S NOT FAMOUS.
2,If you thought the original was bad...,This movie was pretty terrible. The acting was horrible - the murders were horrible and the special effects were non existant. The original April Fool's Day was fun... it had everything a horror movie should have -and it even had himbos - dumb cute guys running around 1/2 dressed -- not just the bimbos in high heals. You could see the twist ending of this movie coming 5 minutes into the movie. I can see why this movie went straight to video -- get a group of friends together with a hand cam and you can make a better movie than this.
2,B for Bad,"The original April Fools Day is not classic, but it was original and had the unexpected twist. This movie suffers because you know there is going to be a twist. It also suffers from sub-par acting and a bad script. There are some nice pretty girls to stare at, but that gets tired very fast. If this was comically bad, I would say to rent it for a laugh, but this is just a bad, boring movie."
3,"Rich, intriguing, but slow","Ultimately, this book just wasn't for me. I stuck it out through the whole 4-book series, but it was tough going because of the tangents and obscurity. However, there are many moments of fascinating glimpses of images, storylines, and ideas throughout. It's an exceedingly layered world and narrative."
1,Free was too much !,"Fairy tales from other countries- prose is awkward, most stories banal and my grandbabies of 4 & 5 would be bored. Sorry, but these ""Color Fairy"" books are lame. ( and I downloaded about 7..all were the same). Skip these free books. I erased all of them as they were a waste space on my Kindle."
1,Qi Gong for Cleansing,Qi Gong for CleansingAfter using it once it didn't work in the cd player.Bad CD.It seemed like it would be a good workout but way to much talking in between.I purchased this at Amazon.
2,old shut eyes,"The lithe and suave club-hopping Italiano who made them swoon with his loose and boozy croon is a distant memory on this expansive collection of late night lullabies. As evidenced in the kitsch cartoon cover and sleepy song selection, the emphasis is on snooze (Dream, I'll Buy That Dream, All I Do Is Dream Of You, Dream A Little Dream Of Me)not booze, bright lights or broads. Unfortunately, Martin's laconic quavering isn't suited to a relentless pillow soft procession of beddy-bye drowsers so gooey and tame they rarely flutter above a deep sigh. Without even a slight variation in tempo, these 15 honeyed orchestrals with Mr. Moonlight only serve to illuminate the failing of his easy vocal style, unless of course you're an insomniac."
3,interesting but too long,"The video incorporates different kinds of postures in a fun way. However, I think a 40 min non-stop sessions is too long to hold any 3-5 year old's interest. Instead, if different routines, each at the most 10 min. long had been presented it would have been better. A parent could guide the child do those, or even accompany the child doing them. And by having different routines there would also have been more variety for the child.My three year old grand son soon lost interest and moved away to play with some other toys."
4,When You Get Down...,"Listen to this awesome, uplifting cd! Okay, so this is not a calm and soothing type of uplifting cd. This cd is not for those who like quiet music. Audioa is loud! This cd has a great message and it's fun to listen to. I only gave it four stars because Hit Parade is better. You won't be disapointed if you buy this cd! It's awesome just like Audioa!"
5,"Perfectly peachy,and totally funky!",Underdog is a totally funky CD. It is a great rock CD and I could listen to it over and over again. My faveorite songs on it are Underdog and Hands & Feet. They are awsome songs to listen to when you are feeling down or just want to have fun. Wait. Those aren't the best songs on the CD! All of the songs are the best! I bought this CD because my cousin said it was an awsome CD. And she was right! I'll never regret buying it. For those of you out there that love christain rock music I really recomend Audio Adrenaline's Underdog CD!
5,God Really Comes Through On This Record!,Audio A has always been good on putting their faith in their music and this is the best! The massage is great! AWESOME JOB GUYS! GOD BLESS! P.S. Buy this record
5,Just Watch the Fuse Burn,"This is just flat out one of the smartest contemporary heist films I've seen -- Darin is completely believable and the editing is sublime. Really, how many times do you hear someone talk about a film's skillful editing? Don't get me wrong, it's subtle and takes meticiulous care in building, so don't expect anything like The French Connection, but if you're patient enough to watch the fuse burn then the fireworks will ignite in your head. (9/10)"
4,Splish Splash,"I read Icequake before this book. I think Icequake is better.The scenario for disaster is credible, but it strikes me as much more deserving of extrapolation than the story provides. There is always tendency by writers to spend more time on characters than circumstance in Apocalypse novels, and it's a weakness probably none can get past.Regardless, the scenario being credible makes it all work. Grab yourself a copy."
5,love it!,"Love this pizza cutter! It's so easy to use and easy to clean! I did a lot of research before I bought this. I highly recommend this pizza cutter, most especially to those with kids! No blade to worry about!"
5,Best Pizza Cutter ever,"This is the most simple idea, but the best. We all laughed at my husband when he bought it, now we want one for everyone!! No cheesy mess, cuts better than a wheel!!!Awesome product!!"
4,"These do work well, but are made of soft plastic","The design and simplicity set these pizza cutters apart from other (usually much more expensive) designs. They do what they are designed to do, and do it well.But ... they are manufactured from relatively soft plastic, so they don't last long if you use them to cut the pizza while the pan is still hot: the cutting edge will partially melt! And even if you wait until the pizza has cooled, the hard surface of the pan or plate will still cause the edge to dull over time.So buy a couple extra. I did."
3,Doesn't prevent bed sores--but may help,"Seems to be holding up OK. Bottom edge is rolling up on itself, which makes an uncomfortable ridge that I can't seem to get rid of. Pile has matted down, but not pilled."
3,"Horseradish, Spirulina and Turmeric.","Those are the listed ingredients of this ersatz wasabi. Spirulina? Blinking algae! Have you ever wondered why the wasabi paste in tubes and the wasabi you mix with powder bear so little taste-resemblance to any wasabi you've had in a 'ryokan' in Japan? Might it be because there is very little real 'wasabi' in the majority of products sold in the USA? But this product is not the most absurd; there's another brand, being sold for $6 an ounce, which is mostly powdered spinach, and yet another that bulks itself out with $6-an-ounce cornstarch. Nevertheless, don't pester yourself by reading the labels! You'll just get yourself into a tizzy of frustration.Meanwhile, note that most customers are happily satisfied with this product. I might be satisfied, too, if I hadn't lived in Kyoto for a year. Does anyone in the amazoo have experience with cultivating her/his own wasabi plants?"
2,Pretty but...,These are VERY thin metal and they bend very easily. I wouldn't have bought them if I knew they were SO thin. My 2 year old plays with them now.
3,Recycled stories with new pictures,"""Creatures of the NIght"" takes two short stories Gaiman wrote for his collection ""Smoke and Mirrors"" and reconstitutes them into comic book form by artist Michael Zulli. ""The Price"" is about a black cat that protects a family from the Devil night after night without the family realising and ""The Daughter of Owls"" is about a beautiful girl locked away who defends herself one night against possible rapists, using magic means.I've read ""Smoke and Mirrors"" and, though I remember them, they weren't the strongest ones in the collection and so they make average comic book stories. Illustrated nicely by Zulli using canvas and oils, it's an alright read but seems more of a cashcow for Gaiman, double dipping old stories into new books."
4,Reference,This book is a great thing to have. It brings thing to your attention that you would not have thought of. It has helped me to better market myself and helped improve my business.
4,This song is a hot song with a euro style to it.,"This song had a european style to it. It's lyrics were horrible but then again who needs lyrics. Music isn't the lyrics it's the notes. This song is up beat and makes u feel like goin to a club.The U.S. needs more up beat new songs New York gets them but we need it all over. I'm an amazin lookin guy that likes two dance with alot of women and this is a song u can do that too. not to long ago i had to go to europe just 2 get this music and go to clubs. Now it's all changing techno ,rave ,and house are a huge part of the future."
5,The Essence of 2000 dance music,"i first heard this song in September on Open house Party and I was just amazed by it! Imagine a great dance beat, computer enhanced vocals (similar to Cher's new sound) and a really strange video that is totally addictive and you have BLUE. Now, go out and buy this CD!"
4,"Nice dance hit....Summer hit in Club IN, Copenhagen, Denmark","Very catchy tune, i'll only know the hannover remix but it sounds great"
2,blue,"this is a popular song among the young teenage crowd. I believe the kids only like it because it has many words they can sing to and a good beat, but they are really confused what the meaning of the song is about or what the chorse really says. I sounds like ""i will deed i will die"" to them. That is the feed back i am getting from them. That is a very mixed disturbing message children are receiving. I would like media, radio stations, or something to clarify this for them. we bought the single to blue and it did not come with the lyrics to the song. and what it DA BA DEE anyways. What does this mean. What is the whole meaning of this song, ""BLUE"". other than someone is depressed? anyone know? thanks."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!,"You people who like this ""music"" need to get a real cd like Christina A. or Sixpence None the Ritcher. Because this is just TRASH! I listen to this and I want to PUKE! Yeah it may have a fast beat and easy to memberize learics. But if your I.Q. is higher that that of a rock, I suggest NOT getting the cd!"
4,Cool song if you like Blue things! I do.,If you like blue things you would defenitly love this song. It's the best song. I've only herd it twice and it's my favorite song. If you like it buy it before it's sold out.
2,baby gets shocked...,"yes thats right: do ba dee I'm blue is jibberish. Techo no funk is good (Cher, Madonna, Kid Rock) but once again this tune is the proverbial special effects movie searching vainly fot a plot syndrome here folks. It does have a hella good beat and good hooks though.good video with the aliens: Is that claymation?"
4,Remember Scat,"For all of you who are confused as to the meaning of the rambling in the chorus of this song, look no further. I belive you will find the same answer that a great trumpet player, I believe ""Dizzy"", found when he discovered that he a had left his mouthpiece off stage. He then began to sing his part without the use of his trumpet. These ramblings are just another form of musical expression. I happen to like them, you may not, but please don't dismiss an idea as stupid just because you don't like it."
2,Annoying effect,"What are we to make of this seemingly meaningless recording? By the time it ends it has expressed little and accomplished nothing. Chief among its features is the use of the vocoder, a machine first heard by most people in the seventies that distorts vocals; it has been recently used by Cher and others. Simply put, vocoder effects were cheesy in the seventies, and they are still now. I hope this trend will soon pass, like the too-much-echo and saxophone solo fad of the mid eighties, or the harmonica solos of the mid nineties. Here the vocals are made terribly annoying."
5,Absolutely riveting!,"Blue is an absolutely riveting song that gets me off my feet everytime i listen to it! Blue breaks all forms of techo barriers previously set by other techno tunes by causing listeners to sit up and rave up with its trance-like flow of words like ""I'm blue, da ba dee uhm ba da""..."
4,An Enjoyable Book,"Little House in the Highlands is a very nice book to curl up with on a Saturday afternoon, but it is not a very good history book to read for school. This is only the first book- I think the other three books are much better than this one. However, you should read this book. I found it very enjoyable and the fairy tales told in it are very interesting. (By the way, you might have trouble reading this book if you're not used to a Scottish accent)."
5,A really good book,"Little House in the Highlands tells about six-year-old Martha Morse, who would grow up to be Laura Ingalls Wilder's great-grandmother, while she's living in Scotland in 1788. Martha wants to be good and ladylike like her sister Grisie, but it's impossible for her to sit still during a spinning lesson when her brothers are outside playing on the rolling hills. And it's very hard for her to hold her tounge. Will Martha ever stop getting into trouble? Find out in this great book!"
5,"Don't miss this series, in the original","This is a wonderful series, enjoyed by myself as much as my daughters. After reading all of the Martha books, Martha Morse and her family live in my head, they're well written, delightful characters. Make sure you search out one of the original, unabridged editions. The ones with photographs on the cover are severely abridged. It's amazing what publishers can get away with. If the same were done to beautiful paintings or statues it would be called vandalism."
5,A wonderful book,"It is a wonderful book. Unlike any of th others it gives you the true feeling ""What would it be like, to live that long ago, but in a wealthy family?"" I can't really compare it to any other in the series. It is one of a kind. Any adult or child who has read some of the others will fall in love with this book. Grab it and go read!"
2,"works, but is not great","pros:1.cheap2.works3.my kid likes itcons:1.rack clamps onto bike and scratches the paint (does not bolt into rack mounting holes)2.bar is not movable so getting a 2year old in and out is difficult.3.seat is not quick to remove/replace, if you plan to take the seat on and off.4.shoulder straps do not stay on shoulders."
3,"Good Carrier, but one problem caused a MILD INJURY.","Overall the seat met or exceeded my expectations in terms of the installation, adjustment, and use. We bought it last fall and until last week hadn't used it in warm weather. After returning from a ride in the seat with my wife, my son had cuts/scratches on the inside of both arms above the elbow(wearing a t-shirt). The cause of the injuries was the edge of the large holes on the sides of the wrap-around cage. The molding process left very sharp edges like you might find on a plastic knife. I sanded down all the edges and its fine now, but as you can imagine, we were a little annoyed. It could have just been my unit and all others are fine, but I don't think something that can cause that type of injury should make it past quality inspection."
5,Light but sturdy.,I feel very confident in my child's safety in this bike seat. It has opened up a new way to spend time with him and get some excercise.
1,ugg,I took it back because it wouldn't attach to my bike. It was a pain to put together and even more of a pain to take apart and put back in the box. I don't think there is any way to know if it while fit your bike and for that reason I do not recommend this product.
1,crap design,i have no idea how ppl even got this thing to installed on their bike. the part that mounts on the rear is way too narrow to fit any bike except maybe a kids bike. it is about 2 inches too narrow.
2,Does not fit ALL frames,"Disappointed as had to really adjust mounting brackets to fit bike...just a regular bike, but this mounting system is made for smaller diameter bikes..like ten-speed frames. diappointed, but is ok and safe, just too much work in adjusting it..they should specify what type of frame it can be mounted to. would not buy it again, would spend more money on one that is adjustable to different bikes."
2,Didn't work well with Aluminum Trek bike,"This seat installs by clamping it tightly to a frame of a bike. My husband had to tighten it so much per the instructions, that he was concerned that his Aluminum Trek bike frame might get damaged. So we did not keep this carrier. We ended up getting the more expensive Topeak Babysitter Carrier.However, we are giving the Cocoon 2 stars for two reasons...(1) Other than the way you mount it on the bike, we liked the overall construction of the carrier.(2) We see many of these carriers (we have seen at least 4) being used by others in our neighborhood with success. They seem to really like them.So if you aren't as concerned as we were with damage to your bike frame and like the price of this carrier, then you should probably give it a try."
4,Delta Michelangelo Two-Bike Gravity Stand,"Does a pretty good job, a little lopsided until you balance your bikes on it properly, but otherwise good. I'd buy it again."
1,Not a stable stand,"This is an awful product. The allen bolts that tighten the poles stripped on the first tightening, the poles were not flush at the joints giving the whole stand a lopsided look. Following the instructions, I positioned the stand against the wall and put my first bike (the heavier one, 23lbs) on the hooks. Ok, no problem here. Added the second bike - the 16lb machine - to the upper hooks, and the whole stand started to fall away from the wall. Took both bikes down, rechecked the instructions, made a couple of minor positioning adjustments and rehung the bikes. Same result. The only way I could prevent this stand from toppling over was to use the top hooks for just a 4lb frame.A most unsatisfactory product and an excellent advertisement for buying a more expensive, stable storage system."
1,Not worth it,The tubes which extend off the body of the rack have less than three or four threads to secure the 6mm bolts. The bolts put too much stress on the threads and stripped them out before I even had a single bike on the rack. I do not recommend this product at all.
5,"Simple, stylish and effective rack","Easily constructed this rack and installed it on a wall. Everything fit well and rack keeps two bikes stable and out of the way. So far, very happy with this stand."
1,Just like a mop,It soaks up whatever you're applying and it's hard to clean. I'd rather use a brush or spray bottle.
3,Break the monotony,"Good reference of ideas for indoor cycling workouts. No longer will the reader be stuck with boring rides, as the authors present a plethora of workouts focused on intervals to break up the monotony and result in better cycling fitness."
2,Less than impressed,"I was very excited to get this ""book"" but I came away less-than-impressed. Not very immaginative and suprisingly small. Nowhere near worth the price."
3,My Book Report,The book was good because Lu Yi gets to carry his little panda. What else I liked from the book is when his father used to tell his son about the daxiong mao. There used to be more daxiong mao in the forest but then some were killed. What I dislike from the book is when father told Lu Yi that the Bamboo was killed because it was shot. It was a sad part when I disliked it from the book. I even disliked the book when Mr. Po shot at the daxiong mao. This genre was mystery because they didn't know when the daxiong maos were killed every day. The theme was about Lu Yi and his little panda. The setting was in China and the conflict was there were no more daxiong mao.
1,Not as it used to taste. What kind of fish are they using now?,"Being buying this product for over 20 years for the particular reason that it tasted like real tuna. My last shipment was such a waste of money and after opening several cans I couldn't help but notice the fish smelled and tasted very different this time. It was such a shock that I actually headed to Fairway and bought a couple of cans to compare the odor and taste. The ones from my local store tasted great as usual, the ones from my last shipment (I ordered 2 boxes!) from Amazon had a quite sharp odor as if some of the fish had been on the border of being rotten. Hope this is an issue with storage but I won't be buying this product from Amazon anymore."
3,Barbeque Tongs,These tongs are great but I gave three stars because one of the plastic handles came off and I had spend time making a repair.
4,Ghosts of Chicago,"Powerful portrayal of the haunted cemeteries and buildings in Chicago. The history of each haunted area, the possible candidate that became a ghost and the relevant incident(s) leading to his/her death or murder are portrayed very well. Interviews with individuals who have seen or experienced the presence of the ghosts, and descriptions by authors who have written books on the Chicago ghosts are remarkable.The portrayal of Bachelor's Grove Cemetery is the spookiest. St James Cemetery is also very spooky.The only drawback is that some of the major ghosts of Chicago are omitted. All in all, an excellent program."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"It might be my own misconceptions that led to disappointment, but I expected more criticism or philosophy than memoir. Parts of her memoirs were beautifully written and fairly interesting, but most of it I found myself wondering how it really related to the conceptual issues she was trying to address. I think I simply wanted a more critical book."
5,Doc & Merle Rule!,"Yep, superb. The best folk album I've ever heard. Been a favorite of mine for years, and I'm mostly a classic rock fan. Sound quality is excellent (may be a digital recording?). Playing and singing is excellent. The only other album that comes close (and makes a nice companion piece to this) is ""Doc & Dawg"". You'll love it!"
4,Good History Piece,"Good historical piece about haunted Tombstone, which really is haunted. I was disappointed to find there were not credits at the beginning or end telling me who did the music as I wanted to get a CD of the soundtrack."
1,HoMedics Comfort Pillow,"Quite honestly, I would never recommend this product, as it isn't at all comfortable, even after trying it for an entire miserable week. I'm saving it for annoying guests, whom I don't want to stay long!"
3,"130 Calories each vs. ""About 44 Calories"" for the Original","I can't comment on the claims that this new Space Food Stick does or doesn't taste like the original. I surely can't remember EXACTLY what they tasted like some 40 years ago. But I do know this; the current Chocolate Space Food Sticks have 130 calories per stick where as the original had ""about 44 calories.""For nutrition info on the current sticks visit [...] or visit spacefoodsticks.com, click the ""FAQ"" link, look for the question ""Are these healthy?"" and follow the link to the nutrition label.For the calorie count on the original sticks, visit spacefoodsticks.com, click the ""SFS Preservation Society"" link and watch the original commercials via youtube. At the end of the commercial, they say ""About 44 calories.""Sounds like they adjusted the recipe to match our current tastes (i.e. sugar it up!)."
1,"Oh no, they are NOT Space Food Sticks","These are not even close to the original Space Food Sticks, unlike ones that were sold a few years ago. The shape is completely wrong, they are chocolate covered and much chewier than the earlier ones.They aren't bad tasting, but if you have Space Food Sticks in your mind when you eat them, you will be sorely disappointed.I won't be buying any more of these."
2,nylon,"These caps were for my husband but they are to thin for him, they don't keep his head warm. Having cancer cotton caps work better for him."
1,This is TRASH - Do not waste your money!,"This dvd consists of two short programs, each of which lasts around ten minutes. The quality of the picture is horrible and it jumps around on the screen to the point that it makes you feel dizzy. It simply shows a fake family having a fake Thanksgiving dinner. You never hear any sound from the dinner - only a narrator reminding the viewer that it is important not to make noise when eating your soup. These are not original candid home movies. The second one is also centered around a family and is partially narrated with the actors speaking breifly. The acting is horrible, the lines are corny and the actors are stiff. The second feature suddenly cuts off mid sentence while the father is talking to the viewer. I was really disappointed with this cheap and awful piece of film, which arrived in a generic plastic dvd case with a generic dvd. Really bad, don't waste your time."
2,Yea...not so good.,"I was somewhat disappointed by this book. It is very poorly written. The novel seems as though it was written by a 5 year old. It also did not go very in depth. All the information in this book you can find on just about any Jessica Alba web site. Also it is already out-dated. One of the good things about the book are the pictures. They picked some nice pictures to illustrate the book. This is one of those things you could skip, unless you're a real albaholic like me."
5,His first and favorite,"This was the first toy my baby responded to, at about 3 months, and he has loved it ever since. It is sure to be sucked on and loved several times a day, and he never seems to get tired of it. It is his car toy as well, and since he is still rear-facing, I always know when he is awake because it crinkles. This is a definite 5-star toy!!"
3,More for younger babies,"I read the reviews and they were so good that I had to get my son this cute toy. But when it came in the mail a few days ago, he was less then thrilled with his new toy. I still think it is so cute, and I am hoping that he will come to enjoy this little toy, but at 8 months old I think he is beyond this little cutie. He looked at it and found the bug, the crinkly wings, the mirror, and then tossed it :0(. He played with it for less then a min., and then was board. To be fair most of the reviews were about younger babies enjoying this toy, so I think I just found it too late. Oh well. I will keep trying, but I think he will keep throwing it down."
3,Mixed Feelings,"In our book club review, we were torn between the spiritual make-up of the story and the dispassionate characters. The underlying theme of overcoming adversity captured a sense of hope that survival was possible. While the book conveyed a message of hope, we found it difficult to connect with the boy and his family. We needed to feel more of an emotional bond with the character in order to sympathize with the boys courage to carry on. The illustrations set the somber tone of the era. We would recommend this book to be used with older students as an introduction to a unit on the Holocaust."
4,Just Juice by Karen Hesse,Hi. I am Ali B. and I am 12 years old. I enjoy reading Karen Hesse's books because they are really full of energy and everything. Although I hated The Music of Dolphins...this one was great! I really liked it when she read her mothers sugar level before delivering the baby. :) Juice and her family go through a lot and they really enjoy things that we take for granit or however you spell that. And Turtle was so kwoot!! I loved it! And the way the father got all the machines together again was great!I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALMOST EVERYONE!!! :)BUT I REALLY HATED THE MUSIC OF DOLPHINS!!! :(*ALI
5,Solid rhythmic sight reading training,"This book does it's work very well. Through slow and steady practice of it's exercises, one can build up one's reading skills as fast as one practically can. It's hard work, but it doesn't get easier than this book.While the end of the book is focused on insanely complicated rhythmic scores, rarely to be seen outside very complicated 20th music, it's still good reading practice."
5,Great spark plug wires,These are super. A great improvement from the ones that I had that were suppose to be high performance type wires. Have this as one of my favorites and will purchase again.
5,Effective and Inexepensive,Works like a charm! I don't have a bluetooth or plug for my phone/mp3 player in my car - this was a cheap and effective way to connect my phone's bluetooth and have it converted into an FM signal. I travel between Dallas & St. Louis regularly and only need to change the frequency 4 times each way in order to keep clear of interference. The integrated mic isn't the greatest unless you are speaking directly to it - but it does work. The rest works well.
4,"Good device, but not for android phone","I had a Samsung Behold and this device worked good. The sound out of speakers is a bit worse than their youtube video and I had to crank my volume way up, so watch out for switching to your music after call ends. I never used it to listen to music because quality is not that good as it can be out of my 650watt Rockford car stereo, but voice activation and connection was fine. Also it doesn't blink anymore once you're connected.Unfortunately it doesn't work with My Touch 3G and it is not Satechi fault. Android phones have an BT issue with anything but headset. I rooted the phone, bought additional Bluetooth apk without success. However, the customer service is outstanding. They offered me store credit since I was 30 days after purchase."
1,very poor quality and statiky connection and no bluetooth sometimes,"this thing sucks! it works okay only sometimes. it always has static and cannot be static free. i have to turn the volume really high to fade the high static sound but hurts my ear because the music is too loud!!!also, when in major highways and traffic and near cities there is no connection at all or music.this thing sucks. its poorly designed in terms of engineering. there must have been quality assurance and poor quality control in the development of bluetooth.also, it does not allow to change the frequency from 88.1 to any other frequencies!"
3,"good for music, not for talking","speakerphone is of low quality. Must speak at the top of your voice to be heard, but not with too much bass or you will be inaudible. Not pleasant to speak this way at all. Music sounds great though!"
3,loved it but it broke after 18mos :-(,I really loved this but it stopped working after 18 mos. :-(I'm shopping on amazon again but not sure if I get the same one.
3,Satechi ... Almost..,"Easy to use. Great iPhone autoconnect for listening to downloads / streaming. But....here's the big catch. Half of it's primary purpose, hands-free phone, performs badly. The person on the other end always hears themselves echoing back. So badly, that I almost never use it for calls. Satechi? Fix?"
1,What happened?,"I was a big fan of the original since it was a new face in the survival horror genre and I anticipated a good following chapter. What I have seen from playing it is a stomach wrenching mess. The game has dropped lower than what the first managed to scrape together in all fronts. Sound and music is decent. Voice acting is bad even for a survival horror game. And speaking of the genre, what is this game? Its a tangled mess of different types. Gameplay is dull with an RPGish atmosphere losing all of its formers survival horror. Graphics arent too good on the eyes either. I was hoping for a terrific followup but im sure after this release Rion would wish he was still dead. Give the first a shot but watch out for this one its no masterpiece."
2,bears thermometer review,The product does not work. It has a narrow range of temperatures and has not adjustment to fix or adjust the needle indicating temperature.John
1,Fundamentalist Christian Bent,If you are not aware: VeggieTales can at times really push God and Jesus and HEll a Damnation and Armageddon. If you do not wish to expose your child to this you should avoid Veggietales in general. Cute stuff with an agenda.
2,Crunchy rice,"Sorry, but I didn't like this rice. White or brown basmati rice has much more aroma and flavor. I also didn't care for the texture...the hull remained crunchy even after an hour of cooking. I pitched the rest of it...a waste of money."
1,Holy Garil,Save your money. i found this book to be pure fiction & garbage very little research was done by the author. Its an Alice in wonderland tale.credroadster@aol.comR. P . C.
2,Simply Uninspiring...,"I am surprised by the positive reviews for this video (see editorial and personal reviews on this page). My 3 and 5 year olds, boy and girl respectively, did not like this video, and to tell the truth, neither did I.With the pastel, still-frame animation and Jack Nicholson's sedate reading of Kipling's tales, ""How the Rhino Got His Skin"" was simply not very interesting . Bobby McFerrin's vocalizations were amazing from my perspective but not enough to carry the day.2 stars for mediocrity. (Check it out at the Library before buying.)"
2,good idea but...,This is a good idea but the light doesn't work very well. The light needs to be able to cover a larger area and be brighter.
1,made for little kids,"We bought this product for our 4 yr old thinking that she would have a blast using it, but it is too small for her. She has a hard time going through the doors and doesn't fit in the ""dressing room."" The mirror is also disappointing because it doesn't even reflect anything, it is useless and nothing more than another selling point. It is only big enough to fit one preschooler at a time also. I wish that I didn't waste my money on this product."
2,"Cute, but flimsy","My daughter received this product for her birthday. The assembly instructions were not thorough. After getting everything put together, she played in it for a about 15 minutes before some of the straps that tie back the curtains broke off. It's such a cute item, I just wish the material was sturdier. Would not recommend this product for purchase. Kids need sturdy materials. This will not hold up over time."
2,Easy to put up and difficult to close to store,loved by the 3 year old's however it's not real durable. After it's first use some of the material frayed and is torn. Also the curtains do not hold together well. Overall I wouldn't recommend it I would suggest something stronger.
3,Enjoyable read,First time I've read this author. It is an enjoyable read and I look forward to reading more of her books.
1,I'll sum it up for you,"What can i say? oh yeah, this is Guilty Gear times two! If that title doesn't get you excited then, well, actually nevermind this game is horrible! Just look at it! What the heck is Sammy Studios? Burning 50 $'s would be more fun. Listen to me, i would know! Oh wait, i forgot that i don't own the game."
5,Great game but be careful who you buy it from!,"This in my opinion is the best 2D fighter on the market,far superior to the likes of Marvel V.S. Capcom 2.There are some price gougers trying to sell this game for close to 200 bucks for new and sealed but in one month (August 2007) the whole gulity gear set is coming in one package for under 40 bucks (this game included).Sort of like what Need for Speed and the Devil May Cry series has done.When this set releases the value of the Guilty Gear X2 sealed games is going to drop from about 150-200 bucks to a mere 10 bucks or so if that.Let these price gougers watch their games values drop to nearly nothing and wait to purchase the full set next month for $39.99"
2,"""Witsful Widow of Wagon Gap""","This movie is for die-hard Abbott and Costello fans only. My wife thinks it's ""cute,"" but to me the film is strained. The story has Costello blamed for the death of the town drunk, and under Montana law he must provide for the widow and children. But not much is made of this, and the rest is strictly by the numbers."
2,Pretty unstable little bike rack.,The picture looks like a great little stable bike rack. The reality is that it's too small and too flimsy to adequately support a men's size mountain bike. I had to put it near the wall and lean the bike against the wall and the rack both. Boo. I'd save your money and just hang your bike on a hook instead.
2,"Noisy, slow toaster oven!","The Haier Toaster oven is inoffensive looking. That's why I bought it. After all, I figured, all toaster ovens perform pretty much alike. Wrong! This toaster oven is slow and noisy. When you turn it onto any function, it produces an audible tick-tick-tick that lasts until the function is completed. So, to toast a piece of whole wheat bread, you have to listen to this clicking noise for the 3 1/2 minutes it takes to do it.Haier RTR1200 4-Slice Toaster Oven/Broiler"
1,utter garbage,"Used it maybe 3 or 4 times, then it stopped working.When it was working, the steam wasnt strong enough to remove stains or mildew on grout as advertised. stay away as far as you can from this product."
3,Be Careful!,"The manufacturer failed to mention that when you purchase this, you are automatically enrolled in the Hatano/Tokugawa clan war. I don't have time to deal with an honor dispute dating from feudal Japan, I have a job and things to do. I can't very well up and leave work because someone is trying to assassinate me. In all fainess though, I did not find myself at a disadvantage when I came apon dilemmas which could be overcome by a skillful application of rope climbing. Unfortunately this model doesn't hold up well to being submerged. I tried some deep-sea ascention, and now it just doesn't seem to work right anymore."
1,MW - Phila,"The book I read is called Invitation to the Game. My class thinks the book is corny and so do I. The person who made the book needs to think more about the book. The characters need more talent, action, and they need to be fun. No one understands the book. I think the book should have more action, and violence, or something the book is whacked. I'd suggest the following changes:If Benta had been stuck on the planet, then that would be a good book. Ants could attack her and eat her hand. Then a big fish could eat her head. Then she'd be a walking body without a head. Now, that would be funny."
4,"Cliff Hardy the Australian Elvis Cole, Excellent !","Wet Graves is only one of two Peter Corris novels that I have read because many of his books are out of print. The main character, Cliff Hardy private enquiry agent as they are called in ""OZ"" is very similar to Robert Crais's Elvis Cole. Both have a dry sense of humor and live with cats.Unfortunately Cliff does'nt have a Joe Pike to back him up. (Joe Pike types are outlawed in Australia) Mr. Corris is an excellent writer, he develops characters and his books have good plots. His writing is (IMHO) not quite up to Robert Crais level but few are."
2,Pfaltzgraff tumbler set- Summer Breeze,The plasticware seems sturdy; time will tell with dishwasher.I was very disappointed that the pattern on the glassware is not'seamless'- there is a large gap between the design; would have returned them but too much hassle to repack. (they were packed very well!)
3,Getting clients killed is bad for business.,"And yet another movie based on the often filmed short story by Richard Connell: The Most Dangerous Game. The ""twist"" this time is that the people being hunted somehow deserved it. I guess this would make the clients vigilante hunters. Naturally, the cast is padded with `bodies' rather than characters. It's all about the kill. There's also some vague archeological references tossed in because the plot desperately needed it to resolve the Hydra problem (you know how pesky Hydras can be).For me the draw was the amusement I gained over the image of the SINISTER captain and the hat that was too big for his head. It's hard to take someone seriously when they don't know their hat size."
1,What An Awful Movie....,"What can I say? There's no excuse for movies THIS bad. It's like watching an episode of Hercules with Kevin Sorbo, only this REALLY SUUUUCKS.No one was in character, the actors were horrific, the action lame, there's really no positives to list, just a bunch of negatives. I didn't even find it entertaining.This is just a mental note to myself, if I ever get my hands on this movie again, I'll remember to trash it right away. The cover looks good though, I think that's where all the budget went."
3,Hero or Villain,"Paula Backscheider is widely regarded as Defoe's leading biographer on the strenghth of this book written eighteen years ago. It is both scholarly and contradictiory. Was Defoe the victim of religious persecution triumphing over adversity ot was he a man of poor character constantly on the run from the law? What we know now was that Defoe was illegitimate and brought up harshly on the margin of things.He was constantly on the run from the law. A homosexual, at a time when this was against the law, he sought the favours and protection of powerful men. He had eight children by three simultaneous wives and ended his life in poverty a refuge from the law. There is little of this in Backscheider's book. But what is there is scholarly and entertaining."
4,Nice fiddlin' & guitar pickn',"If you're a fan of acoustic music, Harvest Home is a very nice album to listen to. Ungar & Mason are very talented musicians and songwriters, and buddy good fiddle & guitar players are irresistable to listen to.This album also contains a number of tracks, including the Harvest Home Suite, that combine Ungar and Mason with the Nashville Chamber Orchestra. It's a nice blend.If you've listened to the radio show Praire Home Companion or watched a Ken Burns film you've heard the work of these outstanding musicians. They're welcome inside my head any time!"
4,Nice simple modern design and finish,"Nice simple modern design and finish (for architects and designer types on a tight budget). Brass construction, fairly sturdy; good value for money from what I can tell since I just installed them. Gatco provides accessories for a typical condition (i.e. 1/2"" gypsum board anchors and screws, and allen key for the escutcheons), but, as was my case, I had to get different anchors and fasteners for my unique wall condition."
3,No Recitative?,"I saw this a couple years ago at the Chicago Opera Theater, and one of the things I loved most about it was the recitatives. I had no idea when I bought this that the recitatives were taken out. So, to me, there are these awkward pauses. It's disappointing.Plus, Schwarzkopf is not at par with her best here; often enough she sounded too breathy. I have her EMI's same series release of Der Rosenkavalier. That's definitely worth buying."
1,What a misnomer!,"This version is ruined by Karajan's driving conducting, which ends up with garbled passages and lack of coherence. Despite the interesting account of Susanna by Seefried, this one is not worth having -- Schwarzkopf's Countess, though different, is to my ear no better than her later one with Guilini, and that one is magnificently paced. The whole thing is not helped by the cutting of recitative, so that at times one has the impression of a ""highlights"" disk rather than a performance."
3,A miss on most cylinders,"Any performance of Figaro without the dialogue is out of hte running for me, but even as vocalism the singing here often misfires. These were great or at least notable singers with lots of experience in Vienna, and Karajan was in his prime, but nothing seems witty or graceful enough--it's almost prissy at times. I would go straight for the classic reading under giulini, also on EMI."
2,Not for Mac network,The printer in itself works good. Prints are fast and great quality. But in my small business we have only Macs hooked up by an Airport network and this printer just won't cooperate. It's been a pain and I am about to quit and sell it.
3,Education major's viewppoint,"This book has great ideas about the theories behind hands-on instruction in math. It is a good introduction to this idea for those who have no experieince with it. It has wonderful ideas about how to teach math to a wide range of students with very varied ability levels. It, however, sometimes over genralizes, and if you know anything about spcial education and constructivist teaching and learning, it would be repetative."
1,Un disco propio del sonido de Puerto Rico.,"Ví por primera vez a esta Tuna en Aveiro, en el décimo certámen de tunas internacional."
3,beautiful but could be matter researched and cited,"The photographs in Valasca's book on the idea of a warrior women's tribe are beautiful, there is no denying that. It is the reason the book earned 3 stars from me at all. However the organization of the book is difficult to follow, the table of contents has no pages and the ""chapter/section"" titles don't appear in the book itself. There is no bibliography and citations are rare. Quotations are sometimes difficult to attribute and their placement seems random at times. Overall I was greatly disappointed in the book. The images are lovely and of value but that's about it."
1,NOT WORTH $5.00,"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY CHEAPLY MADE, THE HANDLE IS GLUED TO THE METAL HOLDER, WHICH WAS NOT ATTACHED WHEN I RECEIVED IT. THE STEVE RAICHLEN SIGNATURE EMBLEM WAS PUT ON OFF-CENTER WITH A NAIL THAT WENT THROUGH THE HOLE WERE THE HANDLE GOES INTO, THUS NOT LETTING ME PUT THE HANDLE ALL WAY IN, WITHOUT REMOVING THE EMBLEM. THE BRUSHHEAD THREADS FOR THE HANDLE ARE VERY SHALLLOW, TO HOLD THE HEAD ON SECURELY.IF I WERE STEVE, I WOULD BE EMBARESSED TO PUT MY NAME ON THIS PRODUCT."
1,Caveat Emptor strikes again,"I'm doing my good deed for the day. Don't buy this. Believe only the 1-star reviews. We'd all rate it lower if possible.My installation was flawless, but this program constantly crashes for no apparent reason with no error messages given. It also frequently and randomly moves or loses objects you may have positioned or added hours ago so you must constantly tweak positions of walls, cabinets, windows, etc., or add them back to the design after the program somehow loses them. It also has a very awkward and limited control layout which almost never allows you to do what a program like this should be able to do. Run away from this unless you're a software masochist."
1,Read these other user's comments and listen as I did not!,"Everything BAD that has been said already is accurate and I wish I would have reviewed the comments before purchasing.BAD (1 star is too much)!!- It has near-child-like renderings- Slow to perform most tasks- Hard to work with as you progress in your design- Great for square home/rooms but forget anything else- Once you get 4+ rooms the programs lags- Some objects take 12 tries to delete if at all- Error messages are useless and vague (easier to start over)- CRASHES for no reason and at random times with no warning- No helpdesk to help- NOTHING on the box is as it depicts- Llacks critical objects (electrical, HVAC, etc.) but has 2 million tile colors- Roof design is poor and not flexible- Plan will not open once it reaches certain size (9+ rooms)- Training video is weak, no manual, left to play to learnSave yourself time, money, and frustration, buy another product or nice pencil/paper set."
5,I wish I could have just gotten this in the first place,"Even for different domain areas you will come across many of these same issues, not by any means limited to physics. An sort of 3D programming and even database construction and a surprising myriad of computer science problems boil down to the same data structures and for that this book is invaluable. So many times I have waded through pseudocode that had NO english words in it whatsoever and no language constructs from any real langauge, or else a mindless regurgitation of proofs and papers that I don't really care about and aren't relavent to actually DOING anything. Instead I could have just gotten this book and not had to constantly tweak and retweak as I realized yet another issue. In short, I'd not have had to reinvent the wheel nearly so much, and lucky for others if they have this book they will not either."
3,50/50,"Extremely comfortable but difficult to sort out. The fabric slides against itself and catches a bit on the velcro closures. Once I got it figured out, though... very nice."
3,Pretty good read,"Definitely entertaining, just wouldn't say I couldn't put it down. Parrish definitely creates some interesting characters, but found that the plot was a bit cheesy. Overall though, just what I was looking for, an easy entertaining crime novel"
3,Typos,Not a bad novel but I found the numerous spelling and punctuation errors distracting as hell and really annoying. How does a book get to print this way?
2,Not a good read,The chief was very unlikable and Kinkaid seemed to have no guts. Every time I picked it up again I would hope that Louis would be stronger but it never really happened.
2,Dead of winter,Plot sort of over the top and unsatisfying. Lots of typos in this edition. Will read another before a final decision on writers.
5,Dead of Winter,After reading the sample I downloaded it to my Kindle. I don't usually read mysteries but was very pleased that I downloaded this one. Louis Kincaid is a very shrewd cop and was able to solve and wrap up the case that had twists and turns that I never saw coming. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly.
4,Suspensful,The authur kept me interested in the plot and wanting to get to the end of the story to see who the murder was.
4,Wonderful!,From start to finish it was awesome. With real life story lines and and characters you can relate to....loved it! I would suggest this great read to anyone who enjoys quality police stories!
4,Flashy but solid,"On some of these songs, Jimmy is all over the place on the organ, though he only is occasionally ""flashy"" for flashy's sake. Great sounding recording-you really get a feel for the club environment- and rapport within this small combo."
4,"2 For The Price Of One, Sweet.","Cool little accessory for Wii-Motes, and they're cheap. Smaller and not as thick as the official Nintendo ones. Buttons are not covered as seen as picture. Does collect dust but easy to clean off. I would recommend."
5,Real Therapy for Arthritis--Not Just Exercise,"With my stiff and aching joints, I need more than just exercise--I need real therapy. With this DVD I get just that. Suzanne Andrews is a licensed rehabilitation therapist so I feel comfortable under her direction. There are exercises to help the knees, hips, hands, neck and shoulders, and because she offers two different levels for each move you can start out as a beginner and still have room to grow within the program. I really love the audio CD, it is perfect at guiding me while I do exercises in the pool. My joints have been feeling so much better since starting this program and I couldn't be more thankful."
4,Another upstate New York alcoholic classic from Russo,"My only regret in buying this book is that I bought a second-hand copy with a different cover in a half-price bookstore...otherwise I definitely would have opted for this edition, the cover of which deftly encapsulates Russo's beautiful, heartsick world. Russo has imbued his awkward ""Ned"" and wayward ""Sam"" with endearing flaws that so become them and their goofy Upstate surroundings. Better than _Mohawk_; almost as smart as _Straight Man_."
2,This book fails to deliver,"This book was filled with information easily found elsewhere, with very little that might actually help a plus sized woman trying to prepare for birth.It was extremely biased toward medical/hospital birth. It interpreted medical studies only in ways that might make women afraid and more complient to doctor's wishes. Little was covered concerning natural childbirth methods, but there was no end to the sections encouraging women to passively allow physicians to do whatever they want.There were some redeeming qualities though- there were several resources listed for plus sized maternity clothes. Also, the advice for discerning wether your health care provider will discriminate against you based upon your weight was helpful.Overall, not worth buying- everything in it can be found online using a search engine."
1,"rip off, maybe not","The charger did not work out of the box, since it only cost 1 cent but $5 FOR SHIPPING i got ripped off.I may have spoken too soon the company said they would send me a new charger we will see."
2,Review of CD of part of a book,"I did not clearly understand what I was going to receive therefore I felt cheated by the end product. I thought Further Up the Organization was a separate book however, I must have been very confused because that is not what I received from you. I will read more carefully next time."
3,Not as good as I remember,"There is one particular episode of S&H; that I am trying to locate, but dont know the name of it. I hoped to find it on Season 2 but it wasn't there. What I did find is that the show in general wasn't as good as I remember. Season 2 generally has ALOT of dull episodes with issues which seem extremely dated now.Apparently in Season 3, the storylines are more realistic so I am considering checking it out. And hoping the episode I am after is on there."
5,My two rivals.,Great show for it's time. A lot of good nostalgia with this one seeing as my ex-wife had a crush on Starsky that used to drive me nuts.
1,Review of USB Floppy Disk Drive - TEAC FD-05PUB,"The technical specifications on the carton clearly indicate that the drive is for 720KB/1.44MB floppies. However, when it is plugged in and attempting to read a 720KB disk a window keeps popping in telling you to format the disk. It will not read it. When a 1.44MB disk is inserted the drive starts to spin and reads it as it is intended to do. This drive was replaced by Amazon with TEAC Model FD-05PUW which operates as intended; i.e. it reads both types of floppy disks."
3,mimsy farmer saves the day,Mimsy Farmer who always seemed to put in a good performance does a goodjob here in autopsy. Without a actress of her skill this movie would be half the movie it is. It wasn't among the better of the giallos of the period at the time. But it does have Ray Lovelock who is always a solid performer and other fine actors as well. The name of the movie would lead you to expect a solid amount of violence and gruesome giallo mayhem.But it's not that violent and is more a traditional mystery thriller. There is like most 1970's giallos lots of nudity though and of course a twist at the end as we find out who the killer is. It's not a great flick but it's a acceptable italian mystery giallo that is completely average at best. That being said the print looks good andis well mastered so it's a decent little giallo film for mystery fans.
5,Great!!!!,"Very nice product. Performs as advertised. Can't notice it and provides a ""clean"" look for your tie. Highly recommend!!! Won't need tie bars or tie tacks again!"
4,Useful piece of plastic,"Yes, this is a tasteful replacement for a tie clip. But ultimately it is only a cleverly designed piece of plastic, that I received in the mail taped to a sheet of paper. There is no reason that it should be sent as certified mail; I had to make a special trip to the post office to pick it up. Ordinary first-class mailing will do, and is good reason that the distributor should lower the presently disproportionate shipping price."
5,Outstanding,I have been looking for this kind of tie tack for a very long time becasue it is great. I helps you keep your tie down while still being able to see the whole tie.
2,Not as great as it could have been...,"The idea behind this movie was a winner, but it was unfortunately executed rather poorly. I wanted so badly to like this movie. I mean, a Christmas time zombie holocaust sounds like it should make a great movie. I found this movie to be too slow. The zombie effects were bad, even by low budget standards. The acting was okay considering it is a B movie, and all the actors were likeable enough. This movie just seemed to be missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. It ended up being kind of boring and forgettable.I will say that the cover art for this movie is amazing and really drew me in to purchase this item. I was tempted to keep it on my shelf for that reason alone, but I ultimately decided to give this one to my brother (a bigger zombie buff than I am). He had a similar reaction to me and said it was ""alright, but should have been better"".Rent this one before purchasing it if possible."
4,memorable if you saw it live,"If you saw UFC 148 live, then it was a fantastic night of fighting! I think if you saw it live then this would be awesome to get!! its pretty memorable. there were 3 fights that went to a decision and 2 of those fights... if i had to describe it for one word.....WAR!!!! when i saw it live, the fights kept me standing!!! and the main event did not go by decision but it was an awesome fight! its a ppv i will never regret buying!!! and there are fighters that we have all heard of before on this ppv!! should you get this?! one word.....YES!!!!!!!"
3,"A must for Karloff fans, a curiosity for everyone else","Something Weird Video scores another mini-triumph (after Monsters Crash the Pajama Party) with this rare and strange collection. If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, there's no question you must have this 2-disc set. Karloff is not only the host, but appears in most of the episodes. Comparisons to The Twilight Zone are inevitable; but the tone of the show more closely resembles Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The quality of the scripts and acting varies wildly, making the series a mixed bag. On the technical side, the picture looks crisp and clean, and the audio is acceptable for a mono recording. A special bonus: 2 episodes of the equally obscure 13 DEMON STREET, hosted by a haggard Lon Chaney Jr. Personally, I hope SWV will go ahead and release the full Chaney series. Overally, an impressive presentation of a Lost Not-Quite-Classic."
2,Buy A Cheaper Set,"Though this Series is a lesser accomplishment for Karloff, it suits Collectors. However, the Cheaper Sets than this most expensive $24.95 one are just as good, I'm sure. Don't waste your money. Buy a cheap Set of ""The Veil""."
4,Simply the Best,"This book is a rare gem. It contains all of the practical experience needed to ferment your own foods and beverages. Yogurt, kefir, country wine, T'ej, hooch, and much much more. It is all in here. Fermentation is such a fun hobby. This book is for the germo-phobe as well. Mircobes are our friends, not our enemies.This book is truly a gift to share with others. [...]"
2,I lost my appetite,"I was really looking forward to getting this book. I thought the author's enthusiasm was really refreshing, I liked his energetic style of writing. I guess I didn't read enough of the ""look inside"" and should have read more reviews.I wasn't expecting the book to be so heavy with social activism. I'm the type of person who looks away when people kiss in movies. I don't want to hear about how a ""trannie"" likes their water kefir while I'm getting ready to prepare a home made soda pop for my kids. But that's just me. I'm getting my money back. you'll get everything you need in nourishing traditions by sally fallon."
4,"Like, with a couple of criticisms","The recipes and enthusiasm for fermented foods are great, and Sandor is very personable. But I have two didn't-like-so-much factors--one technical, one subjective. The technical criticism is that in the Kindle version, I couldn't navigate to different chapters by table of contents, which makes it really unwieldy for going back and forth between recipes. The subjective issue is simply that the narrative is too touchy-feely and ""left"" for my taste. So I was distracted from the excellence of fermentation information by a feeling that I was being evangelized into a progressive viewpoint I only partially shared."
2,Fermentation? Sorta,"This is a book about having AIDS, telepathically communicating with plants, making convict hooch, living in a gay commune and a host of other social issues that frankly make this book unappetizing."
5,Wild Fermantation,"If you want to feel alive, and be really healthy all the time, use this book.I first put together some Kimchi!!! and i haven't stopped making it since.The first four and last chapter are great!!!!happy fermenting!"
4,good remake 21 centure of a classic,"The new Astro Boy is pretty good modernization of Astroboy we know and love. This is set in the future, a boy who is a machine he can also fly. The animation is improved, which is obviously done by computer graphics."
3,Probably would have worked...,"Fan went out on my A/C, so I replaced it with this. After I get it, in the box is a little slip of paper that explains NEVER REPLACE A VENTED MOTOR WITH A TOTALLY ENCLOSED (NON-VENTED) MOTOR. Wow, thanks. Guess which type I was replacing. Put that in the item description maybe?Maybe I am not taking enough responsibility, but this is Amazon, not an industrial supply catalog, and I feel like a little bit more detail in the description is expected.I installed the fan anyways and it lasted 3 days. Fasco D743 is the rough vented equivalent of this. That lasted 2 weeks before my compressor quit. Fun summer!"
4,"Great size, zipper's stiff",This was the perfect size bag I needed for the gym. I absolutely love it. The only complaint I have is the zipper feels a little stiff and sometimes catches when going around the corners.
1,This Model Should Be Discontinued,"The title says it all. My first experience with this model was when I was gifted with it. After a few weeks of service the LCD Display failed. I then ordered a new one through Amazon.com. Again, after a short period of use the LCD Display failed on the new one.--Dennis--"
1,Wrong size sent,I ordered the bowl for the power prep food processor and I was sent one about 2-3 times that size
2,Thank God I borrowed a copy,I'm in a better position then most of the people reviewing this insofar as I didn't have to pay to watch this train wreck.While you would think that the juxtaposition would be interesting any novelty quickly wears off because the acting is so bad. I really wish I could be kinder to this movie because I wanted to like it but my vocabulary fails me when I attempt to describe how bad this. Avoid if you can.
2,"Intriguing premise, lousy execution","This movie looked so good. It has an intriguing plot, decent looking actors, certainly could blow away stereotypes and should have been thought provoking. But the execution was very poor. The acting isn't and it plods along too much. I totally regret that I did not like this film."
3,Just Okay,"Pretty good book, nothing special. I usually enjoy reading books that are part of a series or have a recurring main character. I had previously read Lost Boy Lost Girl by this author and was intrigued when I saw that Koko was part of the so called Blue Rose trilogy (with Mystery and The Throat). However, the topic of the blue rose was hardly a foot note in this book and I will be intersted to see how the theme will progress throught the next 2 books in the series.This is a pretty big book that at times was a difficult read. I felt I really had to concentrate at times so I would know what was going on later in the book. This felt like work to me and I read for pleasure not for work! The story was okay but has been done before and the twist was not really a twist at all for those who were paying attention. The story was also hard to follow at times and I had to go back in the book at times to try and figure out what was going on. But I soldiered through and will move on to Mystery."
2,"Too Long, Too Slow, Didn't Care When All Was Revealed","I like most of Straub's early work but this book didn't flip my switch. It's about a group of buddies who fought in Vietnam together a decade and a half before the time in which the book is set. Someone is stalking and murdering the men one by one, and the survivors of the squad--soldiers who in a moment of violent madness which affects each differently undertook and got away with a massacre of civilians in a Vietnamese village--gather at the Wall in Washington DC in order to figure out who is preying on them, and how they can stay alive."
5,One of the most disturbing books you'll ever read,"I have a Masters degree in psychology, so I'm picky when it comes to ""psychological"" thrillers. I have to say this is one of the most intense, disturbing and complex novels I've ever read, certainly more-so than Straub's supernatural novels (I've read them all) because it is grounded in reality. As with THE THROAT, Straub is utterly brilliant in his allusions to literature, religion and history, and his imagery and character development is much better than Stephen King has ever managed. While I figured out the ""mystery"" about halfway through, this made the novel only more scary. Highly recommended."
5,I've read this book many times,"Although the story is not overly original, I nonetheless find this book compelling. The book touches on themes of Vietnam and childhood abuse in ways that continue to haunt me. I also very much enjoy Peter Straub's writing style--he writes in a beautiful, lyrical manner and with humor as well.This book was not, in my mind, a conventional horror novel with demons, vampires, and so on. But there is a type of psychological horror in it that is very intense. It reminded me of some of Henry James' short stories and the stories of Shirley Jackson.It would be interesting to see what a producer like Chris Carter (of the X-Files) could do with this as a film."
1,Great for boiling water -- but that's it,"This pot is useless for anything short of boiling water. My husband tried to use it for pasta and managed to boil out all the water and had scorched pasta and chipped enamel for his guests. Clearly not entirely the pots fault but due to the very thin bottom, scorching is easy to do. The enamel even burned onto the stove itself. The bottom is really only thick enough for the simplest of jobs."
1,Where are the Stones?,I was severely disappointed in the soundtrack when I came to find out the Rolling Stones' Paint it Black (which was on both the preview AND in the movie) was replaced by this Gob garbage! Really disappointed
4,Works well for someone who has to sit to exercise.,I have a muscle disease and this CD works well if you have to sit and exercise...I like it.
5,This is a great dvd,I like that you can pick the different exercise focuses along with the amount of time you want. It is very flexible.
5,Riviting,"I had read this book many years ago, it was the first Danielle Steele that I had read. The characters are strong and very interesting to read. Of course, All of her books are very well written. Enjoy and happy reading."
4,The Ring,"The book arrived in good condition and in the time promised. I haven't read it yet, but I am sure I will enjoy it when I do. Thank you for a great product."
4,I am puzzled,"I have read all but 2 books from Danielle Steel, so I am a big fan of her.However, this time, I was astonished how many typos there were in the Kindle version.Instead of the word ""have"" : ""manb"" or many similar errors. Sometimes I actually had to guess what the actual word should have been.Is it because of KIndle ?? It was really strange.Otherwise I want to add, that Mrs. Steel is changing her style. I was at a point to predict everything in any book, but now the stories are touching deeper ground. ""The Ring"" is a good example: not everyone is surviving. In addition, there are a lot of twists that one cannot predict. I love that.So I am looking forward to her next book."
5,The Ring,"The Ring was a great story, also an education. I learned alot about the War and how things were during that era. I've always enjoyed Danielle Steel, this is a recommended read. Thank you"
4,The Russians are Coming,"I found this in a bargain bin back in the 90s. I have been a longtime fan of Soviet and east European rock, so I was plased to be lucky to come across this fine specimen of post communist era new wave rock from Leningrad. It is all in Russian, but the vocals have a strong resemblance to the singer in Sisters Of Mercy. I applaud the efforts of this band amid the oppression of free expressionin soviet society.The musicianship on this is not real top notch, but they do well with what they have. The quality is good and it is obvious they use a drum machine. This band can also be heard on the 2 lp compilation 'Red Wave' which feataures Kino and 3 other Russian bands from 1986. The other reviews of this cd are very helpful and Kino are on wikipedia.org for those who want to know more."
5,Very impressive...,"There are lots of things to love about this game. The developers made faithful Lego renditions of the Star Wars characters which impresses me. The characters are determined to fight the evil empire and they still have a cute sense of humor. There are several levels - I'm going to guess at least 18 plus when you go through the level the first time, you can't complete all the tasks because characters are added to the game as you complete a level and the new characters have special talents. So you have to go back to the level with a character with a specific talent to complete the task. Once you collect all the items, they are used to build ships which you can see in the cantina parking lot. The game is a great value and I recommend it for all age groups. It is probably too easy for teenagers but I'm a grandma and I love it."
4,Great Game,"This is a great game for young and old alike, though for the hardcore gamer it may just be a fun distraction. The gameplay is your basic platformer with some decent puzzle elements. The game also incorporates some excellent humor; especially in the cut-scenes. Very good game for just about anybody; I highly recommend it."
4,adrian 11 years old,"It's fun and not violent, because if you kill someone you don't kill the person, you just break it and it just falls in pieces."
2,Good short stories but low quality ebook-wise,"The short stories in this book are a good read, like most of Steven Saylors stories and novels. I was disappointed however by the amount of scanning errors in the ebook version. One should get better quality than this, paying what you pay for an ebook. It should at least have been proofread."
5,Terrific Read!,"This is a thriller that will keep you engaged as you race around the world and climb inside religion, heaven and hell. A truly enjoyable and gripping read. Have fun!"
5,Superlative!,"This recording dating rom 1955 is superb. It rivals many recent performances is so may ways. Although not technically high by modern standards, it is none the less great theatre and bright in sound. This is what Die Fledermaus should be. Rita Streich as Adele is superb, with inflections not even remotely achieved by any other artist, to create a character that is so believable. Elizabeth Schwartzkopf is her usual brilliant self, refined and delicious. Erich Kunz as Dr Falke (the bat) is suave and beautifully controlled. This is GREAT, without exception! Buy it."
2,Disapointed,"I eagerly awaited the arrival this book and was very disapointed. I did enjoy reading about Lu's experience, I found the book to be lacking in one major area, a very important area.. pgeant preperation. I do not feel she did a good job of covering topics related to pageant participation. MAny of the sections such as ""sponsors"", ""mental attitude"", ""make-up, ""skin care"", ""physical fitness"", etc were very short and not very clear. In my opinion the book does not give in depth information about how to prepare. ""101 Secrets to Winning Beauty Pageants"" by Ann Marie Bivans, I feel does a much better job of discussing all the factors surrounding pageant competition and is very throu"
2,A good snapshot of after you win...,"Being a coach, and also a former state/national titleholder, I was hoping this book would give some more useful tips for young women who are just starting out in pageants. While the pictures and the story she tells about her journey through the USA system are very nicely done (and I would love to know where she got those rhinestone hoop earrings!), there was very little about wardrobe selection, entry forms, getting the right ""type"" of look for a pageant, etc as opposed to her experiences after she won. It's a good read and a nice addition to your pageant library if you have one like I do with over two dozen books, but if you are looking for hardcore pageant tips, stick with Ann Marie Bivan's ""100 secrets to winning beauty pageants"" or the hard to find out of print ""How to Win Pageants"" by Ginie Polo Sayles."
2,The Next Flop,It was not as great as I would have hoped. Not one of the best Marvel animated movies. It was not adult oriented but towards children. If you are buying this for your kids then it was a great movie. If you are an adult looking to watch a great hero cartoon then just move on.
4,Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow,The movie is at best .........OK. I would not say don't see it......I am and have been an Avengers fan for a long time. The movie is so-so with so-so writing and so-so acting and so-so plotlines. A pretty good movie for those children who did not grow up reading Avengers comic books.
1,Best for Kids,"I consider myself an average fan of comic book animation. I grew up reading DC and Marvel comics. As I grew, so did the themes and story of these super heroes. The characters (heroes) started to become more complex. The Next Avengers is more for kids. It has the simple storyline of good guys win in the end. If your like me, mature and older, you might not enjoy The Next Avengers as much as the other Marvel animated video films."
3,Worth buying!,Good to see the 2nd generation do their thing. I still like the Teen Titans better however this would be a VERY Good rivalry if they actually get their own series.
3,The Next Avengers,This was a fun little movie. I had expected it to be directed at at a much younger crowd. It turned out to be entertaining to all ages.Enjoy it.-Mitch
4,i absolutly love these speakers,price drop from 1200 to 400 for these speakers and i couldnt belive it. but when they arrived and i hooked them upthey were AAAAAAMAZING the sounds quality is unlike anything ive ever heard...these are a must buy if you have the money.the only draw back.....the speakers are odlly shaped so standing them up is not always easy. and if u have kids keep them away from kids as they can nock them over and these bad boys are heavy so may cause harm. the package was mega heavy too but all in all amazing
2,Just not worth it. Poor sound quality,This unit is only 400$ but just not worth it. The front and center channels are just too small. The sound is not full and it is often hard to hear both music and movies properly. Spend the extra money. trust me
1,Pretty Disappointed.,"I guess I expected a little more tips and tricks for someone who isn't a complete novice on the forefront of savings. This large, almost cardboard-style book reads like a children's book, with a simple tip per giant page.. and the tips all seem pretty obvious. These might be good tips for people who couldn't realize on their own to reduce frivolous spending like Starbucks lattes and tucking aside money for the unseen, but for the rest of us who were hoping for a more novel/article-like book with good wisdom like we've come to expect from these authors, I think the first step to saving to afford a family would be to skip buying this book."
1,Mind numbingly useless.,"I procured this tome hoping that it would help me on a paper I was writing for an anthropology class. What false drivel. Not only was it the smallest of all the books I ordered, it was the most expensive. Then I received it and found it to read like an episode of Goosebumps. If you are looking for anthropological information about shadow people, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an after school special in a book atan outrageous price, you won't be disappointed."
4,Two boys' review: One of Syd Hoff's better books for young boys,"Amazon has this book available through their 4-for-3 promotion. Take advantage of the savings and build your child's book collection.Like Danny's Dinosaur, Oliver the Elephant is a kindly big fellow with the heart of a child. Naturally, my two young boys loved the idea of playing with an elephant who would let them ride on his back and slide down his trunk.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly 80-100 books and Syd Hoff has three titles in our collection -- Oliver, Danny and the Dinosaur and Happy Birthday, Danny and the Dinosaur."
3,"Decent reference, No TOC and B&W photos only","Nice that it is a small book and there is good info for the things that are in there. There does not seem to be any real organization and the index is the only way to find what you are looking for (though it is a small book). I got this looking for guidance on what to plant in my yard in the Florida Keys. Florida climate varies from the pan handle to the keys and I did not find any specific help on what would work best in my yard (i.e. the fact that it is a florida landscape plant does not mean it is good anywhere in florida...) It gives you the info you would need to deduce that if you are experienced at landscaping (soil ph, salt tolerance, freeze tolerance) but I was looking for more direct advice. It tells you where the plant is native to also and since I am looking to plant natives that is useful but still not specific enough. An awesome resource for south floridians can be found here: http://regionalconservation.org/beta/nfyn/default.asp"
4,Good and Practical,Fr. Groeschel gives a beautiful and well rounded view of living a Chaste life. This book is specifically written for those who are also going to be celibate as well.
2,rip off!,"The master cleanse DOES NOT NEED this kit crap! Grade B maple syrup can be found at any health store, co op, wholefoods or anywhere that organic/healthy food is sold.There is no reason to buy this kit you can just do the cleanse on your own.[...].[...].[...]."
3,So over priced!,"Save a ton of money and buy all of these ingredients at a whole foods store, or Harris Teeter. Very over priced."
4,Master Cleanse Starter Kit,"This Sarter Kit helped me alot. Everything you need for the 10 days is there....beside the lemons. The laxative tea taste actually very good, witch I didn't expected at all."
5,Master Cleanse,I was so happy to receive this kit in the mail. I didn't know much about cleansing until I purchased this product. Now I am planning more cleanses in the future.
3,Pam & Jason,"This is a collection display piece which takes Pam Voorhees from the first F13, and Jason from F13 pt2. The look is great, coming with bases for Pamela and Jason as well as an accessory altar stump as viewed in F13 pt2 in Jason's ramshackle abode. The Pam figure is well done and a bit creepy looking. The Jason figure comes with an option of sackheaded Jason or you can pop it off and put on the ""Warrington Gilette"" head of the unmasked Jason from F13 pt2. The set comes with a variety of weapons including machete, bow, spear, axe, knife, pickaxe,and pitchfork. The set looks great, however, the figures just don't remain standing upright on the formed bases for the figures. If you stand them up, within a few hours, there is a noticeable lean going on as the figures attempt to fall over. So without gluing them in place, there is a fault in this display piece."
5,BOOMING WITH SOUND,A new look into a varitey of different artist. hitting the high notes af today's music with the older religon backgrouds.
5,"Ahhhhh, good to the last dribble (tm)","Just as the smaller version this stovetop maker produces delectable espresso in the morning. I make mine with frothed milk, brown sugar, cinnamon, whipped cream and more cinnamon. Yummy!"
5,can't be beat,"An excellent stop-top espresso maker, which I bought to replace a flimsy one I had that just fell apart. This one is solid and produces excellent results."
5,I love this little machine!,"I use it every day, and turn up my nose at coffee that doesn't come from a Bialetti. You won't be disappointed. I use it at home and while camping. The more you use it, the better the coffee is. I never use detergent to clean mine.....only rinse it. When it becomes 'seasoned', it makes a fantastic cup of coffee!"
3,"Insightful, but less economics and more psychology","Very well written in terms of technical coverage and originality of modelling bounded rationality and its application to game theory. However, the author develops most of his theories from either assumption and speculation or no justification at all in terms of formally depicting human rationality. It would have been a much more powerful book if there was a greater coverage of empirical evidence and bridging between psychology, artificial intelligence and economics. This lop-sided approach of modelling using solely game theoretic terminology and concepts ambiguous in their relevancy to simulating human thought and behaviour. However, there are some chapters, such as the one on knowledge representation and the other on limited memory that are the exception to this. Overall though, the book is still quite innovative and worth a read."
5,Fun with bounded rationality,"This is a terrific book for anyone who wants to know more about tractable ways to relax the usual economist's assumption of perfect rationality. The book is well written and includes some exercises which would lead an ambitious reader to write his own book on the topic. If you are interested in bounded rationality, this is a book you should own."
5,Ike's Phenomenal work,"When I listen to Ike, it reinforces to me that the 60s n 70s were the best ever decades in music because it was all very original.Its a rare pick and I am very lucky I have this album today. This one I feel is Ike's best compilation ever with really high quality work only a true genius like him could do. The songs have amazing start and one of the best extended sessions that is not common in the R&B;/Ballad genre of music. If you have liked Ike's work, this one will sway you away. You can never go wrong with this album. The Polydor recording is superb. Just go get it!"
5,Molly Rocks!!,"I haven't even read this book, but I know it's awesome b/c Molly is awesome! I can really say ""I knew her when..."" Viva la Videosmith!!!I should also add that Molly is a very talented writer and a great lover of men and dogs. I'm sure the book is not only very entertaining but seriously well-written."
5,Performance,The Makita GE0600 Die Grinder is the best performing grinder for the money on the market today. Have had this tool for over one year and have put it through its paces. It is of a comfortable size and is powerful enough to handle the most demanding tasks. Davis Woodworking Inc.
3,Not a study guide at all,"This book contains a 125-question practice exam, with answers and rationale behind the answers for each question. Most other information in the book can be obtained from the HRCI website, without buying a book. It is worth buying for the practice exam (taking the HRCI practice exam online costs $45), but not as anything other than a practice test."
5,Fabulous Reference level recording,"I am an audio dealer, manufacturer, and enthusiast and a friend introduced this redbook CD to me. I ended up purchasing 6 or 7 more Wynton Marsalys' Standard Time, Vol. 6: Mr. Jelly Lord CDs. I kept one and sent the others to customers, friends, and industry insiders. The music is exciting and the recording quality is reference level. Depending on one's system, this CD can exhibit a very dynamic, exciting, and very real sense of liveliness. Several others have claimed to use it as one of their reference recordings to demonstrate their system's sonic presentation to customers and associates.I've since purchased several more of the very talented Wynton Marsalis' CDs and have found nearly equal musical excitement and and engineering in these CDs as well.One of my favorites and a must have."
5,Forget about sleeping tonight.,"This is probably the best ""fiction"" book I've ever read. I really appreciate all the research that went into this book. VERY suspenseful, full of useful knowledge (especially in today's political climate), great characters, action, relationships. I think this book will appeal to just about anybody. I can't wait to read more of Clay Jacobsen's stuff!"
3,Do not buy computer with vista,IF you believe me DO NOT buy computer with VISTA atleast for now. It's a junk. MicroSoft is testing their product. You and me paying for it. They are taking advantage since no body else is in the market. HP computer is okay but not with Vista. Another problem is HP support is very poor. They are not willing to help too. Now a days most of the store charge restoking fees. So it hard to return back to the store. Be careful. Do your home work before you buy any computer with VISTA.
2,wonderful,"do not buy pc with vista operting system. i don't recomment to buy it . hp didn't use their name brand parts. compare with dell, what a shame."
4,Very good,"I'm really liking it, even my boyfriend who is a deputy says is very good. We recommend it."
5,"A spectacular ""Il duca d'Alba""","I have owned this CD since it first appeared in late 1999 and have enjoyed it immensly many times. Even 11 years after its release, I find myself returning to hear Vargas over and over, especially his interpretation of ""Angelo casto e bel"". While I prize the entire CD collection, this aria seems achingly beautiful to me. In the last ten years or so, other tenors have released this aria on their recital discs, for example, Villazon and Calleja. As fine as those performances are, for me, Vargas is just that more satisfying. His sense of proportion, the phrasing, and the purity of the bel canto line are exemplary. I just now listened to it again, and the beauty of the piece made me sit and write this short comment. For me, it is one of the most moving performances of this aria I have ever encountered."
3,For fans of Lucio Fulci only,"He scared the pants off us with his Gates of Hell quadrilogy. For those eager to know more about Fulci this is an excellent piece to look at. A prolific career of over 100 movies, this is an earlier Fulci piece."
3,Not surpassing Karajan's earlier set with Corelli and Price,"Some people are quite fanatic with Domingo.Well, his Ah Si here is good, but his De quella pira simply disappointing. No comparison with Franco Corelli's Manrico.As for Kabaivanska, an out and out Slavic soprano that has nothing to do with Verdi really. Why did Karajan not call Leyla Gencer to portray Leonora? Gencer WAS the best Leonora EVER. Not even Price could match her.As for the good ones, Cossotto and Cappucilli are both fantastic in this performance, added by a wonderful Ferrando in Jose van Dam."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"The first day I used it was on the driving range. I was hitting the ball no differently and then I looked at the clubhead and found it had a whole bunch of dents in it. It's not worth the money I paid for it which was $59.99 and that was Canadian. Never buy this golf club. I wouldn't even give it a star, but I had to if I wanted to post my review."
4,The great and merry adventures of England's greatest hero.,"It is a time of crisis in England. With the good King Henry dead and the rightful ruler, unknowing Richard, fighting in the Crusades, the evil Prince John seizes the throne. Interested only in making himself richer, and having no consideration for the poor and middle class people, he becomes a tyrant respected by the haughty rich (few), and hated by the commoners (many). Young Robin of Locksley, son of the Ranger of Locksley, has his lands taken from him by force after the Ranger dies. Robin, cast out with no home, joins an outlaw gang dedicated to helping the poor. How Robin - who laters becomes head of the gang - defends the gang, helps the poor, and wins a name for himself throughout England as ""Robin Hood"", makes this book the magical story it is."
3,Eh not that bad,It was an ok documentary but I don't think I would ever watch it again. Not as good as Spurlocks other works but it is good enough to at least watch it once and see what comic-con really is and thats a giant crazy slutty nerd convention. But hey maybe someday i'll check it out :)
4,Pictures rule!,All I want to say about this book that photos here are amazing and very informative. Text is not so capturing.
5,This is a good book for the beginners.,"The book presents many aspects like predicate logic, state space search,knowledge representation, natural language understanding, machine learning and specially programming in both LISP and PROLOG.I specially liked the chapters on learning, natural language understanding and the programming techniques.The book is unique for its presentation style, simplicity and illustrations. It must be on the desk of anyone interested to join the disciplines of AI."
4,I loved this book!,"I picked up this book because I saw that it was the same author as What Dreams May Come and I was NOT dissapointed. I really enjoyed the fact that the book was easy reading (unlike alot of others of this type) and that it covered some deep material. I don't know if all of it is true, but it makes me believe in Heaven more than ever before. It paints a more realistic view of what happens after our body dies. I will look for this author more often."
1,waste of time,"Not Provencal, just for nouveaux bourgeoisie in McMansions. I own many books on the topic of Provence, including decorating books. This is department store decorating, where one goes out to purchase at one time all the bibelots.I echo an earlier reviewer. These are not rooms in which to live. And, none of them are very attractive either.The text is the same info one can get in wikipedia or other web sites,Don't buy this one."
5,Best sander I've ever used,I've had my sander for over 10 years now and finally had to replace the H&L; pad after 8 years. I am a professional cabinet/furniture maker and use this sander anywhere from 4 to 6 hours a day. It is aggressive and powerful. Leaves a great finish. Well balanced and comfortable to use.After 10 years I finally have to replace mine. The bearings are shot and the armature is shot from being dropped one to many times. I will morn the loss of this great tool.Now the big challenge is to find one half as good as this one. Wish I'd bought 3 or 4 while they were still in production (and I paid about $60 for it).
3,Not 138 minutes running time,"This is a great little collection of short stories that two year olds love. The stories are simple and easy for a young child to understand. However, it is not 138 minutes as described, it is only 30 minutes total running time. I am very disappointed in how short it is."
3,"But Wait, There's Less","This book contains helpful chapters on the common cosmetic and performance improvements. It does not, however, give tips on applying graphics or customizing gauges. The chapters are brief, which means that they lack detail but make it possible to stuff a lot in a small book. But be warned; don't be misled like I was into thinking that graphics and gauges are covered. They are not."
2,lid too big,"I purchased this to store the peanuts I keep in the garage for the squirrels because they chewed a hole in my plastic pail. Unfortunately the lid fits so loosely that they can knock it off with one swipe of a furry paw. Aside from that, it seems well enough made so perhaps I will find another use for it. It would help if the handles had a lock-down feature."
2,There are far better cans than this one,I ordered this can thinking it would hold a 13.9 bag of charcoal. It doesn't come close to the task.I returned it because it is too small and the lid doesn't fit tight. I wanted a weather proof can to store charcoal in outside on the deck. I thought this would do the job and it won't. It's kind of a lightweight can and not what I had expected considering the name on it.
3,"Okay, not great","This can works okay for my pellet stove ashes, just wish it was slightly larger.Also cannot pick it up by the lid handle as the lid is not that secure and will come off spilling all the ashes."
4,Good can for ashes,Bought this can to store ashes from a woodstove. Works great - could be slightly heavier - but works just fine.
3,Steven Raichlen Galvanized Charcoal and Ash Can,I purchased this item for collection of ash from my wood stove. It serves the purpose and is much less expensive then the ash cans sold by wood stove accessories stores. My one complaint is that the lid handle is spot welded on and broke off. I reattached via bolts and nuts. It should of been riveted on in the same way as the side handles.
1,I didn't even get halfway...,"Do I HAVE to give stars ??A very demanding book, has more to do with how the brain work then chess...The first pages are very interesting (thats why I bought it) but then it gets very hard. It expects you to look at positions and say what you think into a recorder and then analyse that and...There formulas in there about how you should pick your variation wich would be great,.. if you had the memory of a computer. A friend of mine (elo 2150) came too same conclusion. ""What the hell is that"" he said ;)Don't buy this one."
1,Doesn't fly,"We bought this ornithopter kit from another retailer, gyroscopes.com, and paid nearly 16. I've just spent about 5 hours putting it together. Some of the plastic pieces were difficult to stick on the metal rods, and overall this was very fiddly and made my fingers hurt. But in the end, all looked fine and matched the diagrams. We wound it up (10 revolutions), and the wings flapped once then got stuck. As another reviewer said, the workings were indeed sticky and the flapping wasn't smooth. It didn't fly. Quite disappointing - definitely not worth 16, but I wouldn't waste $7 on this either!"
2,A Very Old Retrospective,"Alas, this was a great disappointment. The documentary dates form 2009 and it is clear that Mr. Domingo's narrative was filmed around that time. However, all of the clips are from decades earlier--one has to guess exactly since none are dated. Therefore, no development of his acting, singing or, for that matter, looks, are provided. His colleagues in the performances are not named--so one has to know that it is Kire te Kanawa or whoever else. An equally large negative surprise was the fact that none of the clips are from performances at the NY Metropolitan Opera. Is this due to copyrights, the unwillingness of the documentary makers to pay royalties, or something else?There are plenty of documentaries out there regarding Placido's contemporaries that move, educate and uplift. This one on Placido, unfortunately, is not one of them---by a long shot. Wish I could get my money back."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"I bought this printer years ago. First, it seemed great! But then, the print-heads began to fail badly. All of the printer capabilities failed fast. Moreover, the ink is REALLY expensive. You would be better off buying a new printer every time the ink runs out. That is how pricey it is. Not to mention, that if one color (cyan, yellow, magenta, etc) is low, the printer will NOT function until you replace that cartridge. That is a major drawback.However, the fax still works, the scanning resolution is really good, and I can still use those features. So now I use it solely for those two purposes. Other than that, it is a paperweight!You would be better off buying a different printer. Hope this helps someone :-)"
1,"DON""T BUY THIS HP L7580 Printer","The HP L7580 freezes up all the time. It will not print a document over 10 pages. and forget about printing a presentation that has 15 pages. well you can print it if you want to print the current page one at a time. and that won't last either. Bam it froze up again. story of this printer.Well i cant say that it does that with all operating systems just vista.we called both Vista and HP. Both says it is the others fault and the other company is working on this problem to fix it. If both companies are blaming it on each other, than i don't think either one is trying to fix this.So In the short....DON'T BUY THIS HP L7580 PRINTER... buy one that works!"
1,Terrible printer,"I've had many printers for my home transcription business and this is by far the worse one. It makes my computer screen black out intermittently every few seconds which makes me lose my typing. It doesn't always print upon command and you have to manually uncheck the ""print offline"". It took over an hour to install. You get no support from HP whatsoever. They try to make you feel like you're a complete idiot. I was told that I didn't have it plugged in properly. It james frequently. It has my computer messed up and errors are appearing all the time. Once you uninstall the printer, everything is back to normal. I've had HP All-in-one printers before but this one is absolutely the worse hands down. I don't think I will ever buy another HP printer in the future. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. Save your money!!!"
5,Good All In One,"I Purchase this Printer because my fax machine died and my old printer was not mac compatible.I have owned it for 2 month and am very pleased so far.very good at faxing was easy to set up on my pc. I had to download drivers from hp to get my mac to work. I set it up as a wireless network printer through my wireless router.everything works well, i can scan wirelessly to my macbook also I can use the photo card reader tosend pictures wirelessly to the mac."
5,Excellent Machine!,"Thus far, we are really enjoying our new multifunction printer. Consumer Reports 2008 has not let us down with their ratings on this machine. Highly recommended machine."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"The paper feed takes the paper in crooked. I finally decided to try to fix this myself. I cut strips of cardboard and put them at the left edge of the intake tray between the edge and the slider bar. This keeps the back edge from moving around as it takes in the paper. It takes some trial and error to get the thickness right so that the margins are equal down the page, but so far seems to be much better.As other reviewers mentioned, my feeder tray on the top also takes more than 1 sheet at a time, so I always have to hand feed faxes and scans. What a pain!My fax machine won't accept faxes from one of the companies I deal with regularly because they are auto-generated and come as ""Out of Area"" with no phone number. Also a pain!Although the price is reasonable, I expected a lot better product from HP. I would suggest buying a different brand of all-in-one or at least a different model. This one stinks!"
4,"Riveting, Exhausting","In Father and Son: A Novel, the star is the villain, the antihero. Instead of hating him for all his dastardly, savage deeds, it's easy to care for him. He is, in a sense, a wayward vehicle, a device gone bad by way of circumstance, killing or crippling anything in its way. Larry Brown weaves a tale of tragedy that leaves the reader exhausted, reflective. After all, how many of us, if we suffered and survived the same boyhood as this criminal, would have emerged with any greater sanity"
3,A Mississippi state of mind.,"When I moved to the Mississippi delta from Florida in the mid 70's, the first thing I thought: ""These are the slowest talking people on earth."" I was constantly wanting to finish sentences for them. Same thing with ""Father and Son"". There's just too much beer, too much coffee, and too much fishing to bring closure to what is, essentially, a pretty simple story. Although the story takes place in the mid 60's, I could certainly relate to the characters, because they were still there in the 70's (as they had been in the 1870's). Brown has a good sense of time and place, but he should, since he knows it like the back of his hand. This is a pretty good book, but like the language of Mississippians, it moves too damn slow for me"
3,No masterpiece but stylishly directed,"Since Moving Targets is the third Simon Yam film I've seen with a scene in exactly the same café (PTU and Fulltime Killer being the others), I'm beginning to think he owns the place and is supplementing his salary by renting it out as a location. The film itself is a minor and disposable Hong Kong actioner about two cops (one seeking revenge on his father/superior officer) who end up on opposite sides of the law that has the benefit of being for the most part extremely well directed even if there's a lack of focus in the predictable last third that lets down the best of what has gone before.Easy to watch and just as easy to forget, this at least marks Jing Wong out as a director whose work might be worth further investigation - though a glance at his resume on the IMDB doesn't seem very encouraging, boasting as it does titles such as Raped by an Angel 4 - The Raper's Union, My Schoolmate the Barbarian and Love is a Many Stupid Thing."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Fourth revenge.This is probably the best of the Demon Princes books, as our hero chases his next opponent, Lens Larque, across space and to many planets, finally ending up on one that has a really interesting, if rather bloody local game that they play.Given there is a fifth book, Larque's chances obviously aren't too good."
4,Very handy and a very usable product,"This helped me finish a very difficult exterior paint job. There were many layers of paint on the great redwood siding. Was very difficult sanding and scraping, with sandpaper being constantly clogged, and with the siding getting lots of marks and mars, that bothered me. This tool was very good at heating and softening the paint layers, so that I could remove them much more easily. It really helps to have an assortment of various scraping tools available as well, to help with this. process"
4,Delightful,"""Letters from Maine"" is a gorgeous collection of meditations on nature, love, and various internal truths. Sometimes celebratory and passionate and sometimes introspective and melancholy, these poems flower in the mind and leave the reader blissful. May Sarton is more known for her fiction, but certainly her poetry is worthy of similar attention."
1,Cheap stuff,This is advertised as a quality product but is cheap stuff. The net would not work at all and wouldn't attach to the table. If you are serious about your game this will be a disappointment.
3,"OK, inexpensive paddles.",The rubber padding was pealing off on the first day. There is also a sharp edge on the handle that digs into your hand and makes a sore spot.
5,"Fun, fun, fun",No issues here. Fast shipment. Excellent product. I do commend this seller and would buy again. I had no problem setting it up. Family enjoying it from day 1. Works great on top of pool table.
5,s brown,I came across this book when I was cleaning out my mothers basement. It had been a gift to my grandmother Madge Branyon in December 1966. (written on front page of book) So I decided to read it. It is an excellent devotion book. The prayers at the end of each devotion are so powerful!! They remind me how awesome and mighty my God really is.
2,8 Minutes in the Morning,"I hoped to get something new from this kit... Well..., only good thing is the explanation about eating habbits we have and sample menu. Exercises are totally helpless! I just wonder how people could lose weight following this program?! Good luck with selling this kit."
2,The Classic Pointer Sisters End With A Whimper,"""Having A Party"", the last album the Pointer Sisters recorded as a quartet (and their last on David Rubinson's Blue Thumb label) before Bonnie's defection to Motown and Ruth-Anita-and-June's decade of pop chart success as a trio, thoroughly disappoints. By and large, the songs are nondescript and lackluster; and Sam Cooke's pop classic, ""Having A Party"", is given a perfunctory reading, the vocals all but obscured by canned ""party"" noise. This is for Pointer Sisters completists only. Anyone else will want to use it as a coaster."
2,too small,"The idea behind this product is good. However, it is really really annoying because I have to keep adjusting my computer - make sure it's balanced... It's way too small for my 16"" laptop. I'm seriously considering getting a different stand."
3,"Great for the price, but has one big flaw","This was just what I was looking for to use with a tv tray, but unfortunately my laptop keeps sliding down. If there had been a lip at bottom or sticky pads on the ""lifts"", I would have given the product 5 stars."
1,not worth it,"I understand the concept, but this does not cool my computer as well as I would think it should. You can just put a book along the side of oomputer and it would do the same. This is not worth a second thought...use a book to elevate your computer and save your money. Not worth it."
2,Cheap.,"These ""cooling"" pads are nothing more than a piece of foam. They barely hold the computer upright enough for adequate ventilation. I would save your money and buy something that's better."
4,Nice and simple,"There isn't much meat to this product. It's lightweight, but durable. It gets the job done, w/o weighing you down, and w/o breaking the bank."
5,Great buy for the purpose!!!,"The laptop lift arrived on time and went to use right away. Serves its purpose, and for the price you can't beat the deal! I have wasted sooooo much money on other similar products when this does the same thing for way less money!!! Love it!"
4,satisfied,I got exactly what I wanted at an extremely low price. Which is very good. Saved a lot on this purchase.
5,Exc Condition & Fast Shipping,"This was a great deal. The book was in excellent condition, arrived promptly, and the price was about $70 less than I would have paid buying from the college. I'm in the first year of my masters and I plan to use Amazon for all my texts."
5,"Buoyant, Vibrant Baroque","What is so pleasing and refreshing about this baroque offering of Handel's Grand Concerto is the period instruments that Collegium Musicum 90 utilizes.It provides a different, yet satisfying sound, with the strings somewhat subdued which this reviewer is pleased by. It seems a modern desire to have the strings rise above the other instruments, but none of that here. It is all well balanced and vibrant.Their is excellent pace and intonation and dynamics in their playing, especially in their delightful rendition of the long Musette in No. 6.Having not heard the recordings utilizing more modern instruments, I cannot make any comparisons."
2,PARTS MADE OF PLASTIC,"Nice, stylish, looks good. Would like it more if the parts weren't made of plastic and break easily making this torch lamp unacceptable. If it were not for that fact that it is attractive, stylish, looks good, priced right, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not for me,"This is one of those cases where I trusted the reviews and got burned. I love psych music, but I can't listen to this. The sound of the guy ""playing"" the jug is too much for me to take, and the songs just don't do anything for me. People swear by this album, but I think you had to be there to appreciate it."
4,Somewhat larger than expected,"Excellent product that works as expected. The physical size of the unit is a little large to hide behind the crown molding at the top of a display case. Mounting it as far back as possible minimized the problem. So long as the wife is happy, I am happy."
3,Index is messed up,"While the content of this book is great. The index is messed up. When I look up something in the index, for example stretch marks, it lists page 147 but it's actually on page 81. This is very frustrating as I love the way this book is written and would love to use it as a reference book, but I'm not able to. Has anyone else encountered this problem?Sadly disappointed,RBailey"
2,a tiresome diatribe,I have read and enjoyed The moronic inferno and Night Train but this struck me as pretty meaningless. Granted there are some sharp insights scattered around but nothing to repay the effort required to wade through the self indulgent verbiage. I threw it across the room in exasperation with ten pages to go! Maybe I don't have the intellectual capacity to appreciate Mr. Amis' point of view but it is a severely demanding task to finish this one. My advice is read The Moronic Inferno instead.
1,What is this book about?,"Frankly, what is all the fuss about this book? It's a book about absolutely nothing, and you can guess what the protagonist's wife is doing behind his back really early in the book. I really don't think this is worth all the money Martin Amis got!"
3,Just Like the Saturday Morning Cartoons...,"An episode of Road Runner for intellectuals, with the protagonist, a failed writer, as Wile E. Coyote, and his ""friend"", a much more successful writer, as Road Runner. If you still like the cartoon, you'll like this, but otherwise, probably not."
2,The book that goes in circles,"I'm halfway through and can't see where this book is going. Amis comes up with some inventive language, but the story line limps along. Perhaps something gets lost in translation. I'm pushing myself to finish it."
3,Probably 3 1/2 stars,"This book was a bit quirky but fun. Two authors, old friends, become pitted against each other in some ways because one has become wildly successful - and undeservedly so in the eyes of the other. Money, revenge, humor, and all kinds of craziness ensue. It's the only Martin Amis novel I've read so far, so I can't compare it to his others, but I liked it."
2,Is that it???,"This book infuriated me. Amis is an author who I always promised myself I would enjoy. I had owned the book for years, and after a few aborted attempts to get into it, I finally got hooked. The principals contained within the novel are fine, pitching Gwyn Barry's Lust & Greed against Richard Tull's Jealousy. However, the plot and the characters are so over-developed that there is never a chance to tie up all the loose ends. After persevering with the book for 300 pages expecting a firework finish, the fuse never lights."
2,Stylish silliness,"Well written but halfbaked, and ultimately pointless as usual when it comes to Amis. Very funny, and sometimes stimulating, but not satisfying as as whole. Amis is mimicking himself. Too bad, because he's not worth mimicking."
3,A pleasent change of pace...,"The band has certainly changed from the harsh emotions and wrenched vocals of it's earlier records. Renske has certainly decided to go along with more jazz oriented ideas to express something that rides a bleaker tone of resignation other than the denial clouded shreiks on the early records. The gray artwork reflects the diverse, yet not random workings of the music within.While this is not the best that Katatonia has done (go for ""Dance of December Souls"" or ""Tonights Decision"" for that) this record has an interesting, if sleepy qaulity that makes it worth the mention."
3,Ok book.,"I have read many books on Black Magick, and this isn't one of the best ones, but it was pretty good. It is mostly for beginners and a little bit above begginners.But overal i enjoyed it."
5,excellent,I am a physically tiny and carrying around my Nikon with the 28-300 lens was a real problem with the Nikon strap. This new strap distributes the weight and is excellent. I used it on multiple 10 hour excursions and did not have any issues.
5,Not obnoxious,"The red factory strap is obnoxious and not comfortable. Manufacturers could save us a few bucks by not including it in their kits. Op/Tech straps are everything the factory straps are not. If comfort, options, and not shouting that here is my expensive camera are worthy of your concern, then buy this strap. And it is not expensive."
4,Better than the camera strap that came with my camera.,"Very sturdy camera strap. I especially like the ease of removing the strap from the camera. Came in handy when I was trying to position it on me and my backpack. That said, it is not very soft, and still bothered my neck. That is why I had to position it differently on me and my backpack! All in all, certainly a better alternative to the skinny strap that comes with digital cameras these days."
5,"wow, what fun!","I really enjoyed this book! It was fun, suspenseful, and it knew when to end. I would much rather read a 300 page book that is entertaining, gets to the point and keeps you turning the pages, than a 500 page story that drags on and on, making you long for the ending.Blaine Avery is a beautiful, young vibrant woman who was suspected but never charged in the apparent suicide death of her older and wealthy husband. Now, 6 months later, people around Blaine are dying, shortly after being in her company. Are the rumors true? Is Blaine a cold-hearted killer, or is she being setup to take the blame for someone elses' crimes? Blaine claims to receive mysterious phone calls playing childrens songs right before the bodies are discovered. Is she lying to throw the police off track?This book flowed so easily and was over before I knew it. It is a completely entertaining read. It won't take long to finish this book, but you'll be glad you took the time."
1,Fractals,I have not seen original publications of the editors on the subject of the book in the medium- or even low impact scientific journals. How can they edit such book? I strongly recommend ignoring this compilation.
3,A break from the norm!,It was refreshing to read a book that is centered on God and that reminds us that he is the only person able to fill those empty voids in our lives. In my opinion the book was sweet and endearing different than most. I so enjoyed reading about their everyday life's and I loved the characters and the dialog between them.I strongly recommend this book if you are looking for a break from the norm!
4,Excellent Historical Reading,"On a holiday trip to Sequoia I picked up this book at a Bed and Breakfast to read up on the local geographical highlights of the region. This book was so easy to read and filled with historical facts, that I read half of the book in two nights. The author transmits the feelings an the thoughts of the historical figures in a way that makes you feel as if you where there in the late 1800's. This is an excellent book for a pre-hiking or pre-camping exploration of the Sequoia National Park Vicinity. Enjoy the reading!!"
5,Dont hesitate to order Grill and Grill Cover,"I looked at this grill for several weeks waiting to see if the price would change. I had already made up my mind this was going to be the one I ordered based on the reviews given here. The price did not change on Amazon or in the stores where they were either the same price or higher. I would have ordered sooner, but I was a bit concerned about the shipping charge as it appeared there would be one. When I placed the order it said .01. I figured they would determine the shipping charge and add it later, but they didn't, it's .o1. Also, order the 9986 Weber Performer Grill Cover...it fits. We have used the grill several times and its all that I thought it would be."
5,Still great 1 year later,"I bought this grill last year to replace and old one that had rusted out (not a Weber). I needed a working table and it had to be charcoal. This grill not only met but exceeded all expectations.The wheels roll very easily, the table is easy to clean and durable, nothing has rusted in the past year, and the different methods of cooking on this will keep the chef busy trying new things for a long time.The gas starter works great and lasts for about 10 starts. The camping gas cylinders are cheap so I always keep spares. The rotisserie attachment fits with no problem.Everyone who comes over for a cookout wants one of these. After a year of weekly use I still wouldn't buy anything else."
5,Great!!!!!,"For many years, while using a gas grill, I honestly missed the enhanced flavor of foods when using briquettes. I also had a smoker for deep smoked meats. The Performer replaced both, with amazing results. The gas starter eliminates the charcoal starter fluid (and associated taste), and assembly was easy. I have recommended it to all my friends."
4,Awesome- But beware of the counter top.,"Works awesome, fairly easy to assemble. I would have put 5 stars but the counter top was cracked prior to assembly(called weber their sending a new one free of charge), and the lid handle gets a little warmer than my previous wood handle.Update: Received a new top which was also broken. They sent a 3rd which had a different tone of gray and was not broken. I would give this 5 stars if it were not for the countertop."
5,Perfect fit for my needs,"I have the Sony DCS-F818 and the LCS-FHA - an excellent bag for this camera. I also believe in carrying multiple 512MB or 1G memory sticks versus one single large memory stick. I needed a safe carry case for my memory sticks and also needed a slim profile so the case could fit in the front pocket of my camera bag. This sturdy case not only looks good, it fits the memory sticks snugly without being too tight. I would give this 4.5 stars only because there is no way to mark each stick as being full versus being empty. All in all, an item that perfectly met my needs."
4,A good movie deserves a good game,"This game is rather fun. I'm a big fan of animated movies and the DS, so this game was a must. Once you get used to the screen layout it's a lot of fun to play, but there's too many flying books!"
3,Ok for light duty,"I bought this drill a year ago. For 1/2"" holes it works well. The hammer drill part works good also. I have had no problems with the chuck. There is not enough power for using hole saws. The lack of power is suprising because the amperage is high for a drill this size."
5,Updated version works great!,"After reading the mixed reviews, I decided to roll the dice and buy this item because the manufacturer claimed to have fixed the design flaws. I have no regrets whatsoever. It is perfect for grilling assorted vegetables, which is probably all I will ever use it for. And the removable handle, which is a breeze, is a huge plus since this feature allows you to actually close your grill lid if you need to. The handle also fits inside any of the compartments so the whole unit takes up less space when you store it. The negative reviews that cite design flaws are outdated."
1,Funny but worthless,"If this book wasn't meant as real-world guide, it would make for great parody of the ""Disappear from the System!"" crowd. At best, nearly all of the information is outdated, and the asset protection stuff will probably do more to get you in trouble than be of any substantial help."
1,Hook Line and Stinker,"This book claims to be ""A Step-by-Step Guide to Vanishing Without a Trace""... Truth is the information in this book is less helpful than the information provided in the title. He tells you what to do, but offers no advice on how to do it.A good many of the disappearing methods he recommends are illegal, and seem impossible (I guess. Since he only told me to bribe a Mexican official to fake my death and offered no information on how to do it, I really have no idea how possible it is.)Over all it was a fun idea and a waste of money."
2,"A meaningless book, full of commonalities;","This book should be written by a pro for top executives and people in special situations. Having read it and having lived extensively in Central and Latin Americ I compare this work more to a lonely planet for asilum seeking executives rather than a professional guide to a catartic process.And then the whole issue about leaving abroad. What the hell is Honduras Air? (trust me such a thing never existed and never will). Tax avoidance is a serios business. Those who are really contemplating an escaped know exactly how to minimize their taxes or disappear. They need quick tips not generalities.The tone of the book is entertaining, again it does not have to be taken seriously"
1,Takes a crook to write about one,"Skip this book - please. It was written by the biggest fraud alive today. Mr. Pankau was ""removed"" as a director from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners when it is determined (and confimred) that he lied on his credentials about his service in Vietnam and employment with the IRS. This book is an obvious attempt to lash out at those individuals, organizations and government agencies that have worked to expose his shenninigans. The book reads like a self-serving ego booster to validate his own ego."
5,Marc keeps on giving us his best,"If you are like me, you have been waiting and waiting for Marc to release more of his smooth sounding music. It is nice to say that the wait is over and boy has it been worth the wait!! I must admit that I am not too familiar with the originals that he has covered, so this album plays like new material to me. Every song on the CD sounds great and there is a nice flow to the songs he has covered. Marc's voice is perfect to sing songs like this, and Ms. Toby Lightman does an excellent job with her material. Their duet together is a highlight on a disc that is full of highlights. If you are a fan of Marc Broussard and are wondering if you should if you should add this to your collection, or you are looking for an introduction to a new artist and are wondering if you should try this, do yourself a favor and GET THIS ALBUM!! Marc has said that he will be releasing a CD of original material in the near future, but this album will definitely tide you over until then."
3,SOSO---I'll give it a 3.5,"What drew me to Marc Broussard's ""Carencro"" was the authenticity of his music. Something happens when he sings his own stuff that takes you there.I'm not saying he's not good doing this album of all but one cover songs, but he's stuck so close to the original arrangements that it's a waste of his talent.""Come in from the Cold"" is Broussard's only original song on SOS and it's a lovely ballad.My suggestion is to buy ""Carencro"" and stick to the original singers of this wonderful soul music."
3,Good But Not Great,"It's good, 'cause it's Marc Broussard. :) But it sure ain't no Carencro. I'd even prefer the Momentary Setback EP to this. When it was done, there was no song I was eager to rush back to. If you're expecting a ""RockSteady"" or ""Come Around"" or ""Home"", it's not on this album. But it IS Marc Broussard and his voice IS still amazing, so it's worth listening to. It just may not blow you away."
4,Amazing Album!,"This album is incredible! A very good accumulation by one of the best blues/soul singers of our time. Even though these songs were not originally written by Marc Broussard, he sings them as if they were his own, and gives them a different bend than they had by their original artists. I would absolutely recommend this album if you have ANY interest in blues, soul, funk, or folk music."
5,Very satisfied,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas two years ago and it's still in excellent condition -- very durable, but also very adorable -- I was very pleased when it arrived. Almost a life-size baby cheetah, looking pretty close to life like."
4,fact correction on previous review,the reference to dog meat preperation contrary to Lonely Planet's description is from Robert Templer's _Shadow and Wind: A View of Modern Viet Nam_.
5,Love it!!,I have been watching Supernatural since it started. I love this show. I would recommend it too anyone who likes anything about the unknown.
1,disgusting,"After watching the fourth episode I puked, I've enjoyed most of this series but not this one. People should stop making choices that are aimed in order to affect another, that was about as bad as the movie Rosewood Lane."
1,I don't know why this season sucks so much,"I think that this show should have ended with season 5. Eight season is the worst season so far. It is as if actors forgot how to act, dialog seems forced and artificial and all of the jokes are flat and predictable. Back story is weak as well."
2,Picture quality was jerky,"Supernatural is a great show. Enough said about that. If you've made it to season 8, then no review is needed. I was disappointed in Amazons picture quality though. I was expecting to be able to play it through my tv but found that when I streamed it through my computer to my tv the picture got jerky at times. Netflix streaming is significantly better and smoother. I had high hopes for Amazin to get in the streaming market but they just aren't there yet. Downloading and watching videos works great. However, Amazin just can't pull off tv quality streaming yet. Too bad."
5,Supernatural Season 8 Loving it!!!,I chose this rating because I am in love with this show so much no matter what the season is. There is nothing I dislike about it.
4,SUPER-SUPERNATURAL,"If you like SUPERNATURAL, the eighth season will not dissapoint. New monsters are introduced, and ultimate forces of good and evil continue thier epic battle. The show retains its sense of humor and fun pop culture satire, and Sam and Deans characters are deepened and developed. I recommend this show for anyone with a slightly dark sense of humor or an intrest in the mythology of angels and demons."
3,Where's this show going?,"I don't often get into TV series. Up until season 8 began, I have been obsessed with this show. Season 8 seems to have changed directlon a little and it seems a little 'soapy' I""m hoping the show gets back on the track it was on previously."
5,Eighth Season and I hope more to come,I am not great with providing a written opinion but I will say that this series is worth seeing from 1 - 8. If not just for the excellent humor and bantering between brothers.
3,Video Format for Viewing,"I have experienced some confusion while seeking to locate all episodes for viewing this product. Also, in my eforts to edit my paymment methods I initially have experienced rejection upon submiting proper infirmation relating to the method of payment. Another issue occurs while viewing this product when ""intense action scenes"" freeze and unfreeze while audio continues normally. This aside, the product has great potential and I am a loyal fan of the Supernatural series. seasons, and episodes and YES I would highly recommend it to all!"
5,Welcome Jeremy Carver,"Awesome start to a new season under a new showrunner. Supernatural stumbled and lost its way for the past couple of years (that is..if you take into account that it is one of the best shows on TV) but with Carver back as the new showrunner, this episode of the new season gives every indication that it has found it's way again. Jensen Ackles is on fire as Dean Winchester, a warrior back from Purgatory with a severe case of PTSD. The episode sets up the new season with lots of mysteries to be discovered along the way. Highly recommend Supernatural to anyone interested in good acting playing out a good story."
3,"Ok drill, but lacking in power for more demanding applications","Purchased this drill with the intention of using it to mix small batches of mortar (5gal buckets) While it does work, it strains and gives off a burning smell when mixing a full bucket. I purchased theMilwaukee 5380-21 1/2-Inch 9-AMP Heavy Duty Hammer Drilla couple of weeks after this one, I am much more impressed with the milwaukee, it delivers the goods without the apparent strain on the motor that the makita displays. As a contractor intending on using this just about every day for mixing buckets of mortar, I couldn't see it lasting very long. Have since sold the makita and will keep the milwaukee. I would think that this drill would be more than adequate for home and light commercial use, however, for heavy duty use and at a cheaper price to boot, the milwaukee wins hands down!"
1,this so-called 'VHS' tape turned out to be a 'BETA' tape,"I was VERY disappointed with this item when it came in because they advertised a 'VHS' tape, and a 'BETA' tape came in.No one I know even owns, or has ever owned, a 'BETA' player! Thought they went out in 1975?At least I did get my money back, except for the return shipping I had to pay to send it back to emaniquis."
4,this one is much better than other early films!,"This one is thousand times much much better than the early films. Because the film documented the last concerts of the band at the rope of the finance Taxhouse in London UK.The songs such as Do not let me down, Get back, the long and winding road, let it be, I me mine, across the universe are ok & very well represented in the last Beatle film.Beatles with LET IT BE 1970, Led Zeppelin with CODA 1981, before they broke up!"
5,The essence of The Beatles,"This movie tells the story. Read between the lines, the conversations between John and Paul, the looks they give each other, the clothes they ware,, the music. This movie has it all. If you have any interest at all about the Beatles do not miss this. The roof top concert is not to be missed, it is classic , timeless,and unforgetable. Watch this movie closely and you will see why The Beatles are the largest selling act of all time. ENJOY!"
5,Topofclass,"Wisdom for Mothers inspired me to surrender passionatley to the positions in which I am called, mother and wife. It led me back to scripture and that which God has defined for me. I am excited about that which has been defined and the boundaries that have been set for me by God himself. Denise has spelled out direction for mothers and wives as helpmates and allowed room for choice in mothering your children within Christ's guidlines for us. It was just what I have been looking for. The blood covenant of marriage is spelled out amazingly well and presented with tips for sharing with ""of age"" children. This book refers you back to the origin, God's word! I would highly recommend it for those who have been called to stay at home and struggle to have a daily time with the Lord. Prepare to enter into peace and direction from Him. Well written! Encouraging, Inspiring."
5,A must for nature lovers,"This book is now one of my favorites and the Eskimo curlew is now one of my favorite birds. It tells the story of one of the last males (if not THE last) on migration trying to find a mate. The book also gives insight as to what happened to this species and it's history. So tragic!Spoiler: this story does not end well.I recommend getting an older, used copy with the original TM Shortt illustrations, they are brilliant! I recommend this for adults and children over 10. I didn't want to recommend it to younger children because of its emotional impact. If you don't appreciate birds and nature now, you will after reading this book. It's message is matter of fact and not preachy."
5,Last of the Curlews - A book that everybody should read!,This book is one of the best books that I have read recently. Fred Bodsworth writes in a graceful manner that beautifully mixes nature with literature.
3,Radiostudy,"I don't think this possesses the suave depth found on subsequent releases, and tinny indie production does not help either, but rest assured Peng! was a fine introduction into this singular group and all the loopy, light-hearted electro-pop eccentricity that would eventually spring forth fully."
5,the best,I have purchased many drawing and art books over the years. This one is top on my list of drawing books. I would panic if I lost it! lol
3,A bit flippant,"This is a good broad overview of a lifestyle many people may wonder about. It raises and addresses questions the reader may never have thought of on his/her own, as well as addressing practical concerns such as personal boundaries of each partner, care and feeding of sex toys, etc. However, it dismisses many questions rather flippantly, especially in the little lists of do's and dont's. I am not saying that any relationship should be some huge, serious, monumental thing, but a good relationship will have its more serioius moments and will require work. The authors seem to focus more on the fun and dismiss some concerns that seemed to require more thought or work than they were willing to give. ""Yeah, polyamory fails a lot, but so do conventional marriages"" (paraphrase) isn't really terribly helpful to someone who may be curious about this lifestyle."
4,New vistas in music,"I am sure that much of the music on this offering will not be to every one's taste. There are moments of great beauty, moments of grating sounds that were never meant to please but to conjure up images. Still in all, who can not marvel at the miracle of what this artist can do as an unaccompanied player? Ms. Eisler's comments above leave little left to say. To extend her metaphor, not only is this recital one step on a journey to consider the music of other cultures, but perhaps one towards an appreciation of what music can do beyond that which is afforded by the standard repertory. Again not to every one's taste but highly recommended for many."
2,Worked fine until cleaned,"Out of the box the product worked well for a few weeks.When our cleaning lady inadvertantly washed it with whatever cleaner she was using to clean the shower the mirror surface lost its ""magic"" -- now it fogs up quickly. Running a stream of hot water over the surface give momentary utility.Sure would like to know what to do to rejuvinate the surface and make it work again."
1,Last Time I'll Try SK,"This is the third book of this author's I've tried and the third I couldn't finish. I know everyone has their own tastes, but I just dont get the great reviews here.There was a lot of internal ""Whoa is me"" and hardly any action. The two ""heroes"" were sad saps and constantly THOUGHT about how attracted they were to the other but why they shouldn't be. I get that many romances have that, but not 8 chapters without much else."
2,Conflicted,"I'm very conflicted about my feelings toward this book. I read it in three days. I finished it a few days ago, and have been pondering it ever since. The first few chapters sucked me in and I absolutely loved it. I really think the story is breath taking, it's so creative, it's so majestic, I just loved it. But I got the final chapters of the book and was highly disappointed. It felt rushed. It almost felt like she ran out of paper. I kept re-reading sentences to figure out who was talking because it was specific enough. I don't know if I would recommend this because the story and characters are beautiful. But the book itself isn't written well and was a disappointment,"
2,Tortured Hero is Boring,"The whole beaten, tortured, starved, unwanted, and unlovable hero thing is getting a little stale. The futuristic world is not inviting. I have all of the DH books and I can see how the early stuff evolved. At least the DH stories had some interesting characters."
2,Better value bought used,"This story may have been original when Ms. Kenyon first sold it, but after years of Dark-Hunter novels it definitely falls short on originality. It seems as though Ms. Kenyon has stretched herself a little thin and perhaps both she and her loyal fans would be better served if she did not try to juggle so many series and storylines at the same time. Whether Nykyrian reminds you of Kyrian or Acheron or embodies so many other Dark-Hunter characters she's published since she originally wrote this book, this book pales in comparison to other works. Even considering the lesser quality of her recent works, this was disappointing in its familiarity. Loving Ms. Kenyon's previous work isn't good enough reason to buy this book."
5,Another Smashing Hit by this auther,"This is another great book. Born of Night is a great story and fast paced. The book will not disappoint, it is excellent. I hope that the series is a long series just like her Dark Hunter Novels. Another Hit...way to go!"
1,Formalist Garbage,"This is the only way to describe the diagramming efforts that have been shown here. It is almost ridiculous to see the attempt to find the golden rectangle in almost every building. Believe me geometrical nonsense as well as the ""parti"" was no where in the mind of FLW for Fallingwater. Similarly the critical agenda as well as the main ""idea"" of the building is a whole lot richer and important than seeing symmetry and axes. My million $$ question is how does the participant in any space percieve that axis shown when he is more immersed in the feeling of the architecture? I guess that this mumbo-jumbo stopped at Venturi as I havent seen any ""analysis"" (save critical and existential) of Holl, or HDM or Ito or Koolhaas or Eisenmann or anyone of the Avant Garde.Stay away from this book if you want to learn anything about architecture."
5,clean...,"This is a very good concert - indeed. It had been sometime since we heard from Peter Frampton. Tight band - Peter plays incredibly well for someone who has been ""out of the loop"" for so long. The widescreen video is excellent - viewed through component video inputs on an Hitachi HDTV and the afore mentioned excellent audio track in the DTS format. A must have for any Frampton fan........"
4,Why I bought this product,I am a fan of Peter Frampton. I was fortunate to see him in person in Southern MN not too many years ago (2003). I really enjoyed the show. This DVD captures some of what it is like to be there in person. I hope this helps you to decide if you want to own it or not. Sound and picture are of exellent quality on this DVD. Debra Envall
2,Needs work,It is a nicely styled board but it needs lines separating the board into 5 hole sections. It is difficult to count and there is no marking for numbers remaining or skunk. I wouldn't buy it again without that. Really hard to find the perfect cribbage board.
2,Approaches mere exploitation,"There is no substance to this movie. What we have here are a bunch of stereotypical characters victimizing a thirteen-year old Lebanese girl repeatedly. Very little of the story deals with her heritage and coping with that in a bigoted society, and when it does it feels very artificial and forced. The focus of the film seems to be on the girl's nascent sexuality, and pretty soon ""Towelhead"" devolves into a series of scenes that feel, track, and sound like something you'd experience in soft-core porn. I'll give this a star for making people squirm and the guts the actress has for participating in this cinematic sadism, but I did not develop a deeper understanding of life experienced by Middle Easterners as they try to cope with bigotry and misunderstanding. The coming-of-age aspect of the film simply flattens any other subject."
5,As Always,Think Geek is great! I love there shirts and other geek gear. I guess that makes me a geek!
3,Whynott's Giant Bluefin,"An informative, if average treatise about the struggle of the commercial bluefin fisherman. Gets a bit technical with respect to population estimates,quotas,pricing, etc. I was looking for something more along the lines of Linda Greenlaw's ""The Hungry Ocean"" wherein character development,and description of the fisherman's environment take precedence."
3,Reasonable delivery time,"I received this book within a normal delivery time. However, this book was supposed to come with a CD and I didn't get it. I was dissapointed because the reason I ordered it was because I thought it came with it. I am very dissapointed."
3,clinical nursing skills,"I cannot review this produce as I have NEVER gotten it.The book itself is good, that is why I ordered it,However, I am unsatisfied with the results of the purchase. I have not even received an answer and /or refund of why which was submited once before."
2,Poor,"This is a book worth buying only if you are a singer looking for melody and text to jazz/dixie tunes. The chord progressions are weak, with many faults and flaws. The lineup is poor as well, as the compilation process has forced the songs to be typed with no concern to form etc. No four-bars-per-line here. No book to bring along to the gig, but a great resource for old-and-nearly forgotten tunes."
1,HOWARD KEEL: A SNOOZE OF A STORY,"We'd only be making believe if we say we enjoyed Howard Keel's autobiography. And since honesty is the best policy, we'll reveal out true feelings in one word: Ugh. What could have been a fascinating, even important look, at the golden age of movie musicals is nothing but a poorly written, post-humorous (Keel died of colon cancer in November 2004) dud. His take on gal pal Marilyn Monroe: ""She wasn't an experienced lover, but not exactly nave either."") His take on Clayton Farlow, the character hen portrayed on the TV soap Dallas: ""It didn't take a f---ing genius top act the part of that milquetoast."" And then there are the chapter titles, such as ""Golf and Balls, I've Got 'Em All."" But what he ain't got is readers."
1,palm lamp,"The tree painting on this product was ""tacky"" and I ended up scraping it off so it didn't look so cheap. I would not recommend this product. It is now in my attic."
5,the ultimate history of ford trucks!,"I bought this for my own father in 1982. he was a model 'a' and v8 restorer/enthusiast.....he loved it--! i have since inherited the book. you can dip your toe or swim in this ocean of fascinating ford truck history! model T's, early V-8's, fat-fenered 50's, bronco's, ranchero's.....and even Ute's..... mine IS NOT forsale-- but used and above list price...it is absolutely worth it!"
1,Waste of Paper,"No way this book is worth anything over 50 cents. I bought this book because of the many awesome reviews on it, and found it to be horribly unuseful and pointless to tell you the truth. Anything in this book can be found by searching google in 10 seconds, and half the things I would never bother doing so. I would have appreciated a better review before I purchased this book, so please don't make the same mistake I did. If you want to know the abbreviation for north carolina, be my guest...."
5,Used Books = Great Deals,Buying used books is the way to go. Received this book quick and in good condition.
2,Significant transfer problems with this SACD,"Without going into the musicality and joy of Gould's performance which to fans of his needs no introduction, I was particularly concerned with the DSD transfer of the master tapes.On several tracks, I picked up a very unpleasant sibilance/whistling similar to what one would hear if you put your ear close to a television set, and something I have not noticed on on any other SACD in my collection.If you have a high-end system, this will be a very unpleasant surprise and you might want to stick to the red-book release until Sony clears up the problem on this item."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,Lots of work to use this product. Middle support if used requires complete assembly and needs to be totally taken apart to be removed. Side to side support is not very sturdy. Would not recommend this product to my worst enemy.
4,Well Made Product At A Good Price!,"I was very impressed with the quality of the rack, for the price that it sells for! Good directions for easy assembly,fits tightly in the bed of my Honda Ridgeline, and no slippage during transport to my destination."
2,White Wash,"Bill Gertz has done some excellent investigative reporting in the past; however, this book just absolutely looks over the facts surrounding the September 11th attacks. The overall conclusion to this book is that our Inteligence just ""dropped the ball"".An honest look at the facts will show that this is absurd. First, we have many FBI agents who have gone public about the criticism they received from within their departments for even investigating such an attack and David Schippers(Chief Counsel for Clinton Impeachment), who is representing some of these agents in their suits, went himself to the Attorney General's office with details surrounding the attacks two months before hand. He was not even given the time of dayFinally, there is too much information that is just skipped over in this book - I have only included a small amount here. Are we to believe that there were all these warnings and coincidences and still conclude that our Intelligence just ""dropped the ball""?"
5,Should Be Required Reading,"This book should be required reading in our universities, which are becoming a hotbed for the knee-jerk antisemitism of the left. And I say that as a true-blue liberal.This is an exceptionally well-written book and a joy to read, that expertly takes on the Jew-hatred of anti-Zionism and the apologists for terrorists. Yes, terrorists, not freedom fighters. Freedom fighters don't target children, while terrorists make a moral choice to choose evil. This he clearly shows."
1,Item does not work.,Service was great but item does not work with my phone. Spent the money for nothing.
4,Very Solid,"I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I must admit that when I bought it, I was caught up in the ""O' Brother, Where art thou?"" frenzy - so after the first playing of this disc I was momentarily struck by one of those, ""what the heck did I order THIS for"" moments. While there is an obvious Appalachian influence, this is not a collection of old-time thigh slapping tunes. This is well constructed, beautiful instrumental (only) music with a Blue Ridge flavor. It's even possible to say that there is more of a New Age feel here than a Southen one. The music is mostly upbeat, though there is a nice mix of fast and slow tunes. This album will appeal to those who are more inclined towards classical music than those who are inclined to 1930s and 40s traditional Bluegrass. God bless you if you're inclined to both."
5,Excellent resource for art historians and calligraphers,"In his usual clear, comprehensive, and comprehensible style, Marc Drogin details the evolution of calligraphy from its origins to its near demise at the advent of the printing press. Not only does he provide extensive illustrations of all the hands he discusses, he also explains how and why each hand developed and eventually superseded the preceding hands, amplifying his calligraphic information with much social, political, and historical background. Along the way he presents the history of books and book production, including detailed descriptions of scriptoria and humorous tidbits of trivia, like the dreadful curse which was directed at would be book thieves. While medieval calligraphy may, upon the surface, appear to be a very dry subject, Marc Drogin's colorful and interesting style infuses it with life, making this book a valuable resource for medievalists, art historians, and calligraphers alike.--Shirley Sponholt"
2,The first was better...,"When I read the first book in the series (4 stars), I was excited and surprised. K.A. Applegate wrote ""Search for Senna"" with such power, I couldn't wait for the next one. But what a dissappointment. I read the book in an hour and was let down big time. This lacked power and quality."
1,"Horrible, absolutely horrible!!!","This is one of the worst books I've ever read!!! It starts out OK and you're like, ""well - maybe this will be good""... it's all downhill from their. It's a good idea, but the story is stretched, and fake, the characters are unreal, etc. Just remember this - it's bad."
4,Darling as it Looks and then some,"Looks- You would have to see it in a store because the picture does not do it justice. The set is really cute and perfect if your looking for a gender neutral set that's not animals, and there are many pastel colors in this set to do up a nursery in.Quality- The quilt and bumper are thick and soft. The fitted sheet has yet ripped and nothing has come off or ran in the wash. The Moblie is soild and should fit easily on the crib without issues unless defective.Overall- I would give it five stars except I havent had the set that long to put through the test of time yet."
1,"CCNA ""Light""","Although these tapes were informative, I felt it was full of softballs compared to the content of the CCNA exam. I believe it is a stretch to say that these tapes have everything you need to pass."
1,[Garbage]...,"Generic [garbage]... Nothing new. Has a NIN/Ministry type of sound, with ... tough-guy lyrics. Very boring, and is probably a great example of the nu-wave movement; one of the worst rock/metal movements ever."
3,Okay,I thought I was ordering the 81/2 x 11 size so its smaller than what I needed. But I will still use it.
2,cute diecast car,got this as a gag gift and it's cute. shipping took a while longer than expected but it's a nice miniature that comes in a nice little box.
3,"192 PAGES, NOT sheets!","I would give these notebooks 5 stars, except for one thing. They DO NOT have 192 sheets. They have 96 sheets, or 192 PAGES.That fact aside, these are fantastic quality! Not to mention that they look very professional!Like I said, 5 stars, if it weren't for the misinformation."
3,Good but for ballpoint pens only,"I bought one of these to try out as I was in the market for a good casebound notebook to use for meeting notes at work. This is a sturdy, professional notebook that does lay flat and holds up well. I love the red bookmark that comes with it. However, I did not care at all for the glossy paper in the notebook. I write with gel, rollerball, and fountain pens mostly (uniball signos and bic 537rts) and I found that even after 5-10 minutes of ""drying"", the writing would still smear badly on this paper. So you have to write with ballpoints only on it.Also, you should note that the ruling is wide, not college. My preference is college so this was a bigger deal for me than it might be for others."
3,The Game Rocked,"I loved the game, Devil May Cry 3 and for the most part, the book follows the game's story. I was just unimpressed with the artwork and general style of the drawings. If you're a huge fan of Dante, you'll probably still enjoy this book but I've been spoiled by better titles such as the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman."
5,Beer can chicken device,"I like it. No longer have to search for a beer can -- I mostly drink bottled beer. The pan, though it appeared too small, is just right. Good job, Steven!"
5,Beer Can Chicken Cooker,I've been cooking Beer-Butt chicken for a long while - moving up from trying to balance a can+chicken on the grill to the welded wire can holders and now this stainless steel model.This is BY FAR the best. So many products I look at appear to be designed for a particular price point and whether they actually work is at the bottom of the list. This cooker has several nice design features that only would have been included if the designer ACTUALLY USED the product. Good job Steve.
2,Its o.k!,"The look is nice.But the can that comes with it the lid gets stuck inside the chicken.Its really loose.Id rather bought the product without the can.I think it was poorly put together.Shame on the people who designed the the locking mechanism for the lid.Dont get me wrong ""its pretty""!"
3,Warning Product Defect,"My daughter gave us the Steven Raichlen beer can chicken rack as a gift. We decided to try it last night so I wanted to wash it before its first use. I was rinsing the stainless can part and inserted a sponge to wipe it out and sliced my finger on the edge of the can. Unbelievable that this product is manufactured with an edge sharp enough to cut with a gentle touch!BEWARE OF THE CAN EDGE, IT WILL CUT YOU. Otherwise the rack works fine."
5,Very rich and deep reflections from a broad variety of sources,The continuity and consistency of depth and meaningfulness is amazing considering the varied backgrounds and eras of these authors. Daniel Ladinsky does a reverent job of pulling this all together.
5,A sacred experience,"I'm not a huge poetry fan. I could not rate the merits of a poem on its structure or technique or use of metaphor. But I know what moves me and this book is a 10 on the richter scale! These poets are tapping into profound spiritual experiences -- their private relationship with the Divine -- which they have captured in language that makes it feel utterly familiar, that resonates deeply. I love the play of the title -- Love Poems FROM God -- that's exactly what this book feels like. Like when an artist talks about being a conduit for the work. These poems are about the artists' mystical experiences of Divine Love as it has been channeled through them by the Divine. The title evokes that old saw about how, as humans, we can have experiences of the Divine at the same time that the Divine, through us, can have human experiences. Or something like that. Read this book and you'll know what I mean."
5,From this book right to the soul...,"Bible #1Love Poems from God #2If you love pure passion and poetry, be ready to cry.Be ready to laugh and ponder overthings you never thoughtof before. Truely a must have for your library. As for Christmasgifts this year I have no need to worry. No need to shop in crowded, hectic stores.No checklist or hard to wrap packages. This will be the easiest gift giving year ever!""Love Poems from God"" will be gifted to all my sister's and friends."
5,Add the brickwall background and WOW!!,"Purchased this and the spiderman wall cling graphics. What a great room. My grandsons love it! I purchased brick background wallpaper to go behind Spidey. Even though it says it can't go on wallpaer, it did, it does, and it hasn't peeled or curled yet, after 5 months. Looks just like Spidey stuck on the wall. Huge size and easy to put together. It comes in pieces so it's easy to work with, and the price can't be beat! Looked at those Fathead Spiderman graphics and this is just as large, great color and really inexpensive. I'm the best Grandma ever! Just ask them. LOL"
2,I love decals but not this one,"This was by far the worst decal I have purchased, and I have purchased MANY MANY decals. It was really hard to get the legs to match up. It was very thin, as are the smaller ones, but since it was so large the thinness was a issue. I ended up taking it off the wall immediately after putting it up. Do yourself a favor any buy the roommates comicbook covers. They look much cooler and go on easier."
3,This Book is Okay.....,but I was hoping for more information about Cayce's predictions and less about his philosophy of life. Maybe I'll just have to buy another Edgar Cayce book!
3,Doesn't last over a year,We have had two of these blenders and were very impressed with the weight and power of it. We make smoothies every morning with frozen or semi-frozen fruit. We decided on this one because our previous blenders motors eventually gave out. Our first experience with the Professional Series was great until after a year it smelled like the motor was burning out. Our 2nd time the piece in the center of the base that the canister fits onto broke off. In summary....the power is there but they're not made to last.
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good blender. It's quick and does a great job of keeping the smoothies we make smooth. There are no ice chunks. The mechanics seems strong and sound in the blender. My only complaint is that the base of the pitcher seems too narrow and you always have to turn the blender off and stir up the contents to make everything mix. Otherwise, it would be perfect."
5,Excellent blender for fruit smoothies,"I've owned this blender for 2 years and it's served me very well. I use it to blend frozen fruit into smoothies, peas to make soup, and long green leaves to make a ""green smoothie."" I would say it does an excellent job for the first two functions, and a better than average job in blending green leaves and stems (it's not really designed to blend these though). So overall, a very powerful blender and an excellent choice for fruit smoothies."
5,Blender,"Makes fast work of ice cubes. Mixes smoothly. Makes bread crumbs evenly. A simple machine. No bells & whistles. but gets the job done. It's noisy, but who cares, it does the job in seconds. It works better than any blender I've had before."
4,Good... but...,"It is loud like everyone says (although, I have yet to find a blender that isn't). My only complaint is it doesn't move ice and such like it should. It suffers from the same thing every low-end blender suffers from - it doesn't move stuff from the bottom. It blends just what the blades can reach and the stuff up tops stays there until you stir it."
5,They forgot to pack earplugs with this...,"Not much of a flaw as much as it is a suggestion of what should have been sorted with this item because this thing is a beast. LOUD! In seconds you've basically got yourself a smooth, liquidated drink from whatever you plan to make with it. I tested it out myself having a load of ice tossed into it, gave it the simple flip of the switch, and after a roar of its .5 horsepower motor, the ice nearly disintegrated into this fine mesh of slush which had I left it on any longer would have become water in the matter of a few more seconds.I often wonder if I'll go deaf of hearing using this product too much because it really is loud, so if you plan on getting this thing, invest in some earplugs, it just might help. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this item in more ways than I can say."
2,poor quality jar-base,i bought this blnder depending on the customer's reviews actually its a good blender but the jar base was cracked after 5 times of usageits very poor quality ... i had to buy another jar base .. they could make a better quality base :(
2,Buyer's remorse for my AMAZON blender purchase,"After extensive research I decided I would buy a Health Master.Then I read the reviews on the Oster BPST02 and thought that this blender was powerful enough to puree vegetables, fruits , crush ice and make the kind of veggie health drinks-kale, carotts, ginger root, tomatoes, and the like,but was sorely disappointed that it was very sluggish,slow and terribly loud. I mean LOUD and SLOW.The design of the blender does not promote shredding and blending.Poor purchase on my part, can't recommend it no matter what price."
5,great smoothies are worth the noise,"Yes, it is loud but this blender makes great smoothies. I'm looking forward to many more perfectly blended treats."
2,NOT Good for Hot Food!!! Good as smoothie maker.,"Would give it a 4 for cold blending. Powerful, and completely blends up ice for smoothies and milk shakes. BUT the lid turns very soft when it gets hot. I've been burned more than once, and had to clean up the kitchen from all the food spewing out. This is not due to putting to much into the blender. It's because of the flaw in the lid material used. If someone knows of a replacement lid of harder material, please let me know.As someone else mentioned, I do suggest that you get a blender with more speeds.I will keep this one for smoothies, shakes and other cold foods. Now I have to find another blender for pureeing hot soup."
3,Good blender but problems replacing jar,"I have liked this blender a lot and the engine is powerful (though very loud!). The only problem is that after having had it just a year, we've cracked the jar and I can't seem to find any information (either on amazon or on Oster's site about whether this particular model has a replacement jar - or if any Oster jars would work with this blender - though that seems unlikely since there are differently shaped Oster jars that seem compatible with specific models). It is frustrating not to be able to replace this simple part that now makes it impossible to use.update: when I called Oster's customer service, I was informed that replacement jars are currently unavailable and was told to keep calling back to find out if they have become available yet. I was told it could be days, weeks, or months - there was no telling. A pretty unsatisfactory and unhelpful response, as far as I am concerned."
4,"Excellent workhorse, a bit noisy","A powerhouse blender with minimal distractions (gone are the ridiculous 10+ speeds of my childhood). The only drawback is that it's a bit noisy, but it's worth it for the speed, efficiency, and clean retro look."
1,Firewall Problem,"The Norton Firewall for Mac is NOT compatable with the newest Mac's Intel Processors. There is no obvious way to know this until you buy the item, find it does not install, and work your way through the maze of Symantec documents to find the relevant information. Using Live Update does not help, as the program is not updatable for the Intel Processors. I presume it may work with the Mac's that DO NOT have the Intel Processor but still use the updated Mac OS X operating system, but I have no experience with that."
5,Best translation of Bhagavad Gita!,"I have read over a dozen translations of Bhagavad Gita over the past 25 years. IMHO, this is the best English translation. The ""inter-liner"" translation is really a neat idea and I wish someone does inter-liner translations for other ancient works such as Thiru-Kural."
3,Not for Beginner,"The book is a translation from Sanskrit to English. Excellent if that is what you are looking. However, if you are looking for interpretation or an understanding of what it means then better buy some other book like the Bhagavad-Gita As It Is by A. C. Bhaktivedanta. Some may call it biased, but I think it is better for a new reader."
3,"Very Good ""little-known"" Sean Connery Film","Although it is a very poor print, it contains the whole film (108 Minutes).Unfortunately, it has not been either close-captioned, or letter-boxed."
3,It's okay but my students didn't really like it.,My students were easily bored with the game. I have to approach it more as a lesson than a game. I wanted it to be fun to them.
4,excellent review covering power training,"This book is probably the standard in power training. I'm getting ready to implement some of the training programs. Very detailed on power analysis. Although the book can be used along with your power meter software. There is an obvious lean towards using their WKO+ software. Other than that, I recommend the book completely."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a fine book and tells some cool thing about bicycle powermeters. It introduces some usefull concepts, like the normalized power, TSS. You'll understand some capabilities of the limit-less tool called powermeter. It shows how to use an powermeter beyond the ordinary. You'll learn some nice stuff.But the author doesn't give away their gold. It looks like their real secret - the training sessions - are kept away. They begin to show some exercise sessions for some kind of purpose, but they don't show you a lot. I felt like they were writing an teaser, not the full movie.They also tell a lot about the Cycling Peaks software, which is good, but not all that great. I prefer to combine the Cycling Peaks with the original SRM or Powertap softwares to get the most juice.They tried to keep this book from being an big ad and they pretty much accomplished that. I didn't get angry, nor got crazy to go buy their software after reading the book."
5,The Best Guide for Parents to Help Scared Children,"This excellent little picture book is sensitively written to help anyone who has been abused to open up and talk in order to begin the healing process. Because the word abuse is never used in the text the book has been used by pediatricians, counsellors and parents to help children also with other scary secrets like death of a loved one, war, and divorce, and even death of a pet. This book is a MUST for every counselor and every home. It is the BEST way to determine if your child has experienced abuse from some care taker, and the book begins the healing process."
3,Romance in a Home,"Victoria's Secret ROMANTIC STYLE is an opulent book on home decoration where money and maintaince are plentiful. The photographs are lovely. The color schemes can be duplicated in a less ornate fashion to achieve the same results.Heavy use is made of fabrics, candles, and flowers. Fun to look at, but difficult to achieve the same results.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,decent portable AC unit,"I would only buy this over a window AC unit if you value the portability. It is quite heavy, but is on wheels so it is portable. AC unit cools well. Window insert is poorly designed, so you need to use putty or something else to modify the fit in the window sill to prevent the flow of warm outdoor air into the room."
1,Not so good,There were two things wrong with the Delonghi Portable AC that I recently bought and then returned: 1) A minor flaw with the right side exterior plastic panel that kept snapping out of place; 2) A major problem with the circulating fan that started making a loud noise after about 12 hours of operation. The two problems were unrelated.
4,great product,This AC unit cools our server room nicely. The best part is - no tank to empty or drain line to run. Works great for the need.
3,A LOT of stuff that isn't all that related to learning to do the actual act,"There is about 3 pages worth of actual how to info in here, the rest is fluff, stories and yes even fisting poems...might be a good book to buy your woman to talk her into being comfortable with the act, but otherwise, not much that you can't find on the internet."
3,Its not all that,"While the practice of fisting *is* all that, this book is not as much as I had hoped. The main message becomes distracted by too much fluff, women's empowerment, and poetry. The information is, however, excellent, and the book is a unique and wonderful resource for a person desiring a complete sexual practice library. If the extraneous information were used more as punctuation and sidebars, rather than embedded in the text, the book would have earned 1 or 2 more stars from me. The drawings are good to excellent and done with sensitivity."
2,Magazine article for $14,"This book is listed at 112 pages but this is an illusion. Many pages are blank, many have only a few sentences or a long string of silly poetry. If you subtract out the lesbian philosophical musings, you have about two pages of useful information. In fact, on pages 121-122 of ""The New Good Vibrations Guide to Sex"" you get the same basic instruction plus tons of good advice on other subjects. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,A mildly enjoyable waste of time,"WOMANEATER is a mildly enjoyable waste of time. The rather humdrum storyline has been covered before and in better pictures. So many elixirs to discover and so little time! Thankfully, the picture is only 70 minutes. How many ""scientist gone awry"" pictures do we need? Looking for cooky special effects to entice you? Well, if you find a man in plant suit cooky, then you will see this as a great achievement. For others looking for camp value, there is little to see here. As for the technical qualities of this DVD, the sound is actually quite clean and brilliant. The picture suffers from an aged print and some visual artifacts (though these are not terribly distracting, just annoying). As for the price of this DVD, its a bit steep for what you get. No extras on this disc. But with such a terrific cover, you might be able to forget this. Fun for a late night view once and a while."
3,The Woman Eater,"Fairly typical movie from the period. I enjoyed the offbeat performance of the ""servant""."
3,Plant Sap,"This 1957 Columbia Pictures release stars George Coulouris and Vera Day. Dr. James Moran (Coulouris) returns from the Amazon jungle with a mysterious plant which if its sap is extracted, can extend life or even bestow eternal life. Accompanying Moran back from the jungle is a native of the tribe which gave the plant to the scientist and he assists the mad doctor in sacrificing women to the plant. You see, the plant can only live and grow and provide sap if it consumes beauteous ladies. Vera Day plays Moran's lovely young housekeeper Sally, who draws the attention of the native (Jimmy Vaughn, no not of the Fabulous Thunderbirds). The doctor plans to do Sally in when he finds that she knows too much. Will the police arrive in time? This 50's sci/fi horror yarn isn't bad as these low budget thrillers go. This review applies to the VHS version only..This a redo of a review I did earlier."
4,WOMANEATER!!!!!,This DVD from Image uses a pretty good print of a fun little B-movie. It all looks pretty good except for one bad splice.
2,"Small, small, small",Wallet is small. Even my currency barely cleared the zipper. And what's the deal with no change pockets in wallets these days? If you're looking for an ultra slim wallet to carry just a few things this'll probably do just fine (and the zipper is a nice touch). But if they'd just add an inch to the height and find room for a velcro or zip change pocket I would be giving this a 5. Instead its heading back in the mail tomorrow.
4,Soccer Instruction: A Nice Bunch Of Soccer Drills!,"ADVANCED SOCCER DRILLS gives the viewer somenice drills that teams and coaches will enjoy.No doubt, most soccer players like the shootingdrills best. Well this program gives you a little bit ofeverything.Soccer Coaching:Championship Soccer DrillsConsider this other popular soccer DVD by Marty Schupak.Soccer Coaching:Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD SetThis popular six DVD soccer set is also produced by Marty Schupak."
4,Very nice!,"I've tried a few recipes from this book and they are well written and turn out as desired. I wanted more one pan meals and there is a section in the back for ""meals in a fry pan."" Includes appetizers, dressings and the usual meats and vegetables. There are plenty of helps in the front and back about steaming, stir frying and fat-free cooking. I was surprised that there are some recipes for baking bread right in the skillet.Some recipes require the use of the skillet, empty and wash, then continue to use it. I found this to be too much trouble for me anyway. I cook some of my ingredients on the stove and then place in the skillet. But I suppose the author was trying to use the skillet exclusively for a complete meal.Overall, it's a nice cookbook specifically for the electric skillet."
2,So so,Chops meat well but plugged up when I tried to chop pickles. I had to remove plate to loosen the chopped pickles.
3,not bad,only problem is that it will not stay attached to the table. The suction was not strong enough. Also needs something larger to help push the meat through the grinder
4,glad i bought this,"Good product. I've used it a bunch of time already in the month I've had it. Only ""complain"" is that i wish it adheard to the counter, it's hard to turn the crank, push down the food and hold the grinder down with just 2 hands. I really like it but If i were to do it again I'd probably just pay the extra $25 and get the kitchenaid attachment."
4,Almost Perfect,"This grinder does exactly what I expected. It is simple to use and cleans up easily. My only complaint is that the grinder's handle is so long (unnecessarily so in my oponion) that the grider can only be used on the edge of a counter. As you can see from the image, the handle is longer than the grinder so if you want to position it anywhere other than the edge of the counter the handle will not turn and the grinder will not work."
1,Don't waste your time,This was really hard to use since it didn't suction to the counter and the meat kept jamming at the end. You have to keep reversing counterclockwise to make it work right. I do not recommend this at all and advise you to get an attachment to your mixer instead.
5,Great Toy for the Kitchen,"I read the reviews over and over before buying this item. The good reviews far outweigh the bad reviews, so I decided to buy one. The machine purchased works exactly as the good reviews say. I ground two pounds of semi-frozen strips of pork sirloin and beef sirloin - fat, sinew and all, to make meatballs. The machine ground perfectly, though I did lose base suction a couple of times. If base comes loose just re-suction the base to your kitchen countertop and continue grinding. I haven't made pasta yet, though I anticipate if pasta is not too sticky, machine will work just fine. An irresistible and fun toy for the kitchen if your so inclined."
5,NO more pink slim,Use it all the time for grinding up beef. Perfect unit for one or two people. Started using it during the pink slim reports....Did not realize how great a freshly ground hamburger patty tastes. I use a very very lean cut of brisket and add a little olive oil for the fat....fantastic
4,Good for the two of use.,"MY Grandchild age 2 grinded chuck roest for burgers.If she can do it,so can you.Clean up was fast.I just hope it last a long time!!!Yes, I will buy one for my Ozella, for her three boys and Pat # 2.Buy one it dose work!"
2,It is as description but I don't like it,"I don't like it coz it is really hard to clean after you made noodles with it. However, it is really small and save room in the kitchen."
2,Misrepresented. Not made in USA !!!,"This item looks good, I have not used it yet because it has been misrepresented as ""made in the USA"" (but box says made in CHINA for Norpro). I would like to return it just for that reason, but it's not worth the gas to travel to the post office (23 miles to USPS, 23 back). Please, let's have some TRUTH in advertising!! I let's bring manufacturing back to our USA."
4,Value Priced,"This grinder is great for the price. I bought it for the sole purpose of making bologna salad. The suction cup base sticks tightly to the countertop. The thing is mostly plastic, even the spiral part that you put the meat in. I thought that was odd. It's not very heavy duty at all, but for the price of $23 (way better that like $99 of similar others) I like it."
4,Grinding meat perfectly,Price is right. Works well for grind meat. However I have yet to get it to work for pasta. The first try wasn't successful. Pasta came out right but stick together as soon as it dropped into the pan
4,Not made in the USA,Real pleased with how it grinds meat and makes pasta. Make sure you cut meat in strips - 3 to 4 inches long work well with no more than 1 inch wide. That makes it easier for it to go thru the grinder. Suction works very well too to keep it stabilized while grinding.Not happy that it said it was made in the USA but only the company exists in the USA. Clearly stated all over - MADE IN CHINA. Bought this specifically to avoid Chinese made plastic and metal.
4,Knowing where my hambuger comes from,"I bought this after I learned about how hamburger is processed these days. Now I can buy a steak, cut it into strips and run it through the meat grinder to make my own hamburger. Contrary to other reviews I read in advance, it worked very well the first time. It came apart easily to put in the dishwasher and I had no trouble reassembling it. I have only used it so far to grind meat and have not yet tried the pasta options. My only complaint is that the suction bottom does not work well in stabilizing the grinder while turning the handle. I had to hold it steady with my left hand while turning with my right hand. Some blood also dripped on my table. While I like the ease of washing and taking apart the plastic pieces, a heavier model would be useful."
1,Sony Walkman,"Cannot get the radio to work. Not worth sending back. Have nothing more to say, but maybe they should send me a new one at their mailing expense"
1,Better luck elsewhere,"This book is mainly an incomplete rehash of information found in more complete form elsewhere. Loving Ganesa by Satguru Sivaya is one that jumps immediately to mind. As for the statue, there are much better ones available, or read about the iconography and make your own -- making images of the gods is said to be pleasing to them."
1,Garbage Ala King,"Quote from local cable company: ""This unit is made for cable providers only and is not to be sold to consumers."" I found that out the hard way when I bought it and took it into my local cable company for activation. My cable company also informed me that the serial number on it was listed in their archive of stolen boxes from TW cable. I'm just lucky they let me leave with the box without calling the cops after I begged them to let me return it to the seller and recover my loss. I brought this to the attention of Amazon but they didn't care. LOL! I guess they're OK with selling stolen goods??? I did get my money back from the seller but I almost ended up in the slammer for buying it. A very nerve racking experience. Feel free to give it a go yourself and find out."
3,"Mucho titulo, poco contenido","Los libros de feng shui todos dicen lo mismo en mas o menos palabras, quien ha leido uno, ya los ha leido todos"
5,Nobody who studies Chinese politics can ignore Wei's ideas.,"""Don't give the Chinese communists too much pressure, otherwise they cannot afford to provide food for the people."" That is a pretext used by many countries or people to delay the democratization of China. Wei's counter-argument was: It is the people who provide food for the communists. Why did you reverse the order? Wei's political analysis is better than a lot of people with Ph.D. degrees. He is willing to tell the obvious even in face of personal danger. From now on, people who talk about contemporary Chinese politics should start from Wei's ideas. If they do not, they should at least explain why they are avoiding them."
4,Excellent product,I have used brass bladed scrapers for years. I highly recommend this product to any and all who have to scrape ice from our car windows. A brass scraper can last up to three years in a mild snow state. In years past I have used three of the plastic kind. This vendor is the only one to carry any product like this. If they are listening I would like one with a long handle and a brush.
1,Scratches glass,I read all the reviews seeing how good this ice scraper is. so I bought it and use it on my car twice. I noticed my windshield had long thin scratches on it. I hope they are not deep enough to crack it in the future. Not recommended using this on any vehicle. Careful with metal on glass. I was stupid and damaged my car. Don't make the same mistake I did.
4,Just what I've been looking for,"This is the scraper I've used and loved for years, but I can't find it in stores anymore. Heads and tails above plastic edges, especially for removing frost. As for complaints about bent blades - it's a scraper, not an ice pick. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the price."
4,Great concept. Handle needs work.,"First of all, the brass blade really shaves the frost off a winshield cleanly. It is a revelation compared to plastic scrapers which really just put strakes through it. So kudos for the right material for the blade. The handle however flexes so it doesn't transmit the force appled by my arm to the blade efficiently. With a sturdier handle, this gets 5 stars."
5,Works in a Jiffy!,"I have only used it on thin ice/frost on the windshield of my vehicle, but it cleans great. I only have to go over a spot one time.It fits my hand perfectly. Great tool!"
3,Not for New England...,"I did not pay attention to the size of this scraper before buying it - it is very small and doesn't work as a primary scraper for New England with heavier ice. However, the positives are:- Well made. The brass edge is nice and will last.- Compact size. It sits nicely the glove box as an emergency spare."
3,Best Scraper I ever used. Until the Handle broke.,The brass blade is the most amazing ice scraper. BUT the handle couldn't handle the abuse of scraping ice rain.It broke clean where it gets narrow. I plan to slot a dalrod and bolt it in place.
5,Works great,I love these brass tipped scrapers. Scraping windows in the mornings suck. Having a good ice scraper makes the mornings suck that much less. A plastic ice scraper just doesnt compare. One pass and the ice/frost is gone. This is a must have in your car.
2,Cheap and flimsy.,"I was disappointed, going by the original picture I saw when ordering this, I thought it was going to be bigger and more sturdy. It's flimsy and tiny to hold onto but at least it does have a real brass scraping edge."
1,Small and Cheaply made,"It's tiny, the blade and handle are much shorter than any other ice scraper on the market. Also the handle has no bend to it like any other ice scraper you buy, it is thin, straight and short. I was embarrased to give it away as a present to my sister in law. If you are going to buy in bulk from China spend a couple more pennies and give people something that they can dig into the ice with."
1,Not a fantastic scraper,I live in NW Indiana near chicago. Tried it out on my iced over car and could not get any ice removed from my windows with it. Sadly disappointed.
3,Difficult English,"Well have not read this book from page 1 to the endyet, but I just do not think it is that good.The main thing I have against it, is that ituses to difficult sentences to explain somesimple things. Not that great for someone who'snative language is not english anyway.I will review this opinion if I read it totally."
3,busy mom,"My daughter loves the stroller, however, I'm disappointed that it didn't come with the car seat carrier. Under product features, it says,"" Deluxe doll stroller is just like the real thing has doll car seat carrier system and snack tray."" I took this statement to mean that the doll hand carrier was included. It does show it in the images section."
2,Jane Austen?? NOT EVEN CLOSE!,"To be Jane Austen is to be funny, elegant, subtle, witty, insightful, and above all, entertaining. This book was NONE of these things. It is NOT funny, it's hero and heroine don't even begin to measure up to Jane Austen's, and to me it is a tarnished, tawdry knock-off. Very tedious and disappointing."
3,I'd give it three-and-a-half if I could...,"Don't get me wrong, this was entertaining, but so much of it was SO predictable, and stoeln straight from Jane Austen. ((I won't put spoilers here.)) Worth a read, but not original enough."
1,Problem with CD,The first CD would not play on my Crosley so I returned. Second CD (replacement) had identical problem. THe CD would only spin but wasn't recognized by the player.No problem with Amazon - got full refund. Both CD's were new.
1,ADS USBAV 709,"This product would not work on my HP dual core 1GZ with 2GZ RAM. The driver out of date error message popped up. When I downloaded the beta driver for VISTA, it was even more of a disappointment. The same error message appeared. My computer did not see the 709. I returned the product for a refund. I should have paid attention to the ""What are you smoking"" review."
1,Unit provides very wierd results,"I purchased the ADS Tech DVD Xpress DX2 Video Converter for my hp Pavilion Windows XP SP3 PC. I have the earlier version (DVD Express) which works very well. Downloaded the software with no problems. Checked the UBS connection through my Windows XP device manager, all was fine. Everthing worked well (REVIEW,sound was fine). When I tried to use the CapWiz 'RECORD' button, Revcived an unexpected ULead MPEG Error. I tried to contact ADS support but could not get any answer to my requests. It ssems the ADS company was sold recently and current tech support is no-operative. I finally found, by accident, a 1-800 number at the new company and it turned out that it was the new ADS tech support. After relating my problem to them I was rudely informed that I was on my own. I have returned the product. I obviously can't recommend this converter based on my experience."
2,2 years review,"Well, after more than 2 years of use all I can say that the S-Video input didn't work from day one.All my tries to get a signal threw it not worked.So I'm using only the Composite input. Capturing straight to DIVX (My premier rezone for the buy) didn't work on my 2Ghz Pentium. Only when I got my new Core2 (about A year ago) the divx is working, but you have limited options configuring it. So I mainly capturing to MPEG2 and convert to divx with VirtualDub."
1,Poor unstable performance,ADS Tech DVD Xpress DX2 Video ConverterAmazon sells this device with very positive feedbacks posted. I have completely different experience. This is poorly designed item with very unstable and poor performance. It started to show its colors just being unpacked from the box. When contacted original manufacturer (ADS) they recommended to download new software that made this unit completely non operational.Conclusion: Bad product and poor return policy from distributor (Electronica Direct). Would not recommend to anyone.
3,Good but....,"I needed to move something off our DVR onto the computer so I could make a DVD out of it. This product worked GREAT but...it is NOT Windows 7 Compatible and why it's not - is beyond me. So we had to ""jury-rig"" an older computer to download it. Had some issues with the drivers, too. Bottom line - it worked GREAT...when we finally got it figured out. If you only have Windows 7 - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,Truly Inspirational,"I finally had the opportunity to watch this movie after several attempts by friends who had seen it at their college campus. I didn't understand what the hype was about until I sat down and watched the film. Talk about a movie that speaks to each and every individual who watches it. Truly incredible. I wish I would have seen this movie 10 years ago as the knowledge and wisdom that I walked away with was very inspirational. The concept of the film is simple but what you take away from it is truly the grand prize. The slew of people that he got the opportunity to interview was staggering and their willingness to open up and offer their views of success and finding happiness in life, was encouraging. Do yourself a favor...buy this film and share it with those you love. It's the little things in life that keeps you strong."
1,lost opportunity,"The guy puts his hands on everybody, grabs their shoulder like they are his long lost friend, some very important people, too. Couldn't finish this film."
5,The Best Movie Ever Made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Eric and his friends went out and did it, made it work, and had a great time doing it. This film really makes you think. It promotes feeling to go out and get er' done. I enjoyed it.Buy this DVD, or become lost"
1,Trash,"It does not work at all. I tried it for a few weeks and it does not work. Do not waste your money. It ended up in the trash, where it belongs."
3,Wet or Dry,"From what I can tell, these products either work well, or they fail. I bought 4 of these to maintain a large Ficas tree while on travel for about 3 weeks. I set them up around the tree, and they started pumping in water. So far, so good. But they just kept soaking in the water. We didn't pay attention for a day or two, and suddenly we had a huge pool of water on our hardwood floors. This was just 2 days before our trip! After we removed the watering probes and cleaned up the mess, we just had to leave on our trip. The Ficas was so saturated with water, it did fine and was healthy as a horse when we returned.IF you are around for a lengthy trial-and-error test, I think it would be possible to set up a system of probes that would keep your plants well watered with only occasional re-filling of the water and not constant monitoring. I didn't have the time to do that, but I will try again this summer."
2,Good Idea but starting is very difficult.,"I bought these to keep my plants watered while I was on vacation. A week before I was to leave, I started them by saturating the cone before inserting it into the plant soil. I used a glass of water and experimented with different levels of height to find which level afforded transference efficiently. I was not able to get a good dampness to the plant soil at any level. I finally left my plants outside hoping it would rain and I would return to find them alive. One made it through and I am trying again to get it to work. Thus far I'm having no luck."
1,could not get them to work,I tested these before I left for vacation. They did not seem to work at all. I was using them on outside pots and unless I was doing something wrong no water came out of them from the water bowl
4,"I don't know why, but I liked it!","I enjoyed this quirky movie. It wasn't a great story, but the characters were colorful and it was very entertaining. If you wait a little while something funny is going to happen. Like everyone else says...It's worth a watch."
1,Junk,This charger is not like the original chargrer and bboke within a week. Not worth buying and sorry I wasted my money on it.
5,WOW,"I purchased this as a ""gift"" for my wife. She absolutely loved it. It has awakened a ""sex goddess"" that neither she nor I knew was there. She enjoyed it so much she purchase a copy for her best friend. Her husband thanks me every time he sees me. Recommend this book; a real 5 star."
1,No sound...Poor customerservice from HP,Could not get any sound from computer after hours spend with tech support online chat (that is the only option since there is no phone number for support!). I sent it back to HP and they supposedly repaired it but the problem remained. Fortunately Amazon took this back. It was my first and last experience with an HP Computer.
4,Comparing Contribute to Frontpage is Ludicrous,"To discredit Contribute because it doesn't allow you to resample images like Frontpage does is tantamount to going back to a horse and buggy because you don't like the windshield wipers on your new Lexus.Incredible.I've deployed this tool to a number of non-technical users to maintain their own corporate intranet web sites, and not one of them has been unhappy.It's not perfect, but it gets better with each new release. As we attempt to break people of the bad code and skills they developed with Frontpage, Contribute is a blessing."
1,This unit is useless.,"My unit worked great for 9 1/2 months and then started diplaying ""Aquiring Signal"", now it works for only minutes at a time. I have to turn it off and on and hope it works. I called the company and they only had one trouble shooting idea which did not work. They said I could return it with the receipt and they would return it to me in a few weeks or I could buy a replacement for $150, even though I only paid $100 for it. I am looking to buy another brand because of the horrible customer service and crappy product."
2,Sirius Xact XTR 8 Satellite Radio,"I received a new Sirius Xact xtr8 on July 25, 2012. I had it activated but to this date Aug 21.I have yet to obtain a signal. The unit keeps reading ""Acquiring Signal""I 've called Sirius service center (located in Manila,Philippines ) over 1/2 dozen times and their techincal support to no avail.They suggested moving the antenna around indoors/outdoors and even buying another antenna. I've tried the unit in the car and still not signal.Sirius then referred me to Warranty Dept, On Aug 20th, I was on phone hold for 23 minutes before a rep came on. Agent could not find my account and said they would have to call me back. Perhaps I should return this receiver to Amazon?"
1,NO customer support. Horrid reception.,"This is my third sirius radio. Unfortunately this is my second xact, and my last. I have emailed xact (the only way to contact xact) three times. I have gotten no response from anyone there. Sirius is no help either. In fact I am considering canceling my sirius account and going back to commercial radio. It is easier listening to commercials then it is to deal with all of the trouble I have had with the radios over the last two months. I caution everyone that xact is JUNK. Run away from xact as fast as you can. This product is a waste of time and money. I am sure there are radios out there that work better. I just have not found one yet."
1,$8 for a $60 product?,"You know the saying too good to be true, well paying $8 for a $60 product is too good to be true. Tripp lite really needs to investigate whoever is supplying these cables. Buyer beware."
5,dvi to hdmi cable worked fine 1st try,"The cable worked perfectly 1st try, had to get it since my new tv didn't have a dvi input only hdmi. I thought it wouldn't work since the number of pins on the dvi port was different than in my old dvi-dvi cable, but I guess that's how dvi-hdmi works.This is really good value compared to the old Monster dvi-dvi cable for which I paid ~$100 and was only 6 ft."
5,Worthwhile Addition,"If you have various play sets that come with a set of balls, eventually you will want to get more to either replace ones that go missing or get crushed. Plus, adding more balls to the set, adds alot of fun.This set is a great addition, they have held up well and can be tossed around without anyone getting hurt (they are not extremely hard.)I will probably pick up another set or two at some time, it was great to see the reaction when there was an increase in the amount of balls in a play set."
5,The Best,This was the best movie ever because. In Holland there isn't Saved by the bell anymore. So I really miss it. THis movie is great just like Saved by the bell
2,I tried it for less than a week.,I ordered this product expecting wonderful things to happen. I think it's overpriced for what little it does. I returned it within a week after letting a friend try it for a few days. Neither one of us were very impressed with it. I would look to see it in the bargain bin online for around 30.00 then maybe I'd buy it again for the few things it does.
5,tea with friends,"This is a beautiful book. It has a very informative guide to teas and their complementary foods. Each month has a theme, menu and a recipe. A little history is presented with the theme and a cute little invitation to join her for tea. A must for anyone who enjoys tea parties!"
5,Big Bill's #2 of 2001,"Love songs? Acoustic balladry? To a certain degree, yes. Morelike, an enchanting voyage down the dark and melancholy. Song #1, Evangeline is 2nd best song of the year. Other highlights include #2 Untitled Love Song and #7 My Sweet Suicide."
3,Beginner's Camera,"This camera works very well for people who are just learning how to use digital media. It has a 5x digital zoom, but no optical zoom. This means that there is no lens to give a clear picture when the zoom is in effect. In other words, the pictures come out looking far away without zoom, and with zoom, they look blurry and pixely. However, I have gotten some excellent pictures from this camera since I got it in December. It's just difficult to take more advanced photos. I would definitely recommend this camera to a beginner, but for serious picture takers, get something else"
1,Terrible Camera for Memories!,"If you care about the memories of your pictures, don't buy this one. The quality of the pictures that we took on our New York City trip at Xmas is absolutely awful. You never knew if you should turn flash off or on to get a decent picture of sights. If you zoom on a person, the pictures is terrible quality, very pixely. DO NOT BUY THIS! You can do better with another $50 elsewhere."
2,Smells awful,"It's basically a decent travel guitar. Plays easily, is portable, has decent sound in the treble. No bottom end, but what do you expect. The glue on the neck joint looked a little skimpy - you can see into the joint a bit where there's no glue. Not a big deal though.The guitar had an awful, toxic smell, like some evil solvent from a Chinese factory. Turns out, as others have noticed, the smell was coming from a greasy black goo holding two leather flaps of the straps together. The goo issues fumes that are a cross between shoe polish and gasoline. And it's strong, any time you open the case up, the smell hits you hard. I threw away the strap, hoping the smell would go, but it had permeated into the case. After two years the case still reeks! Unbelievable. I am going to try just leaving in open in my yard for a year to see if that helps.Otherwise, not a bad travel guitar."
5,Great for people who were too young for it first time around,"Being too young when these comics came around the first time, I can really appreciate the value of this. The quality is wonderful (all pages are glossy, and I'm betting earlier comics weren't this nice.) [...]Great comic! BUY NOW!!!"
3,"Authentic Recipes, but Not Fool Proof Directives","As a fellow native of the East Coast I found ""Sheila Fergusons Classic Cuisine from the Deep South"" heart warming and authentic to the region. When I looked at the photographs of her family I felt like I could have been looking through my own family albums. The only difficulty I had with the book is thatsome of the recipes failed or where hit or miss, particularly baked goods, which may indicate poor directions or inaccurate measurements. With greater consideration for accuracy this book could be truelly outstanding, but as it stands it brilliantly encapsulates a particular regional cuisine, with text illuminated by fascinating photographs, while containing recipes that work well only occassionally."
2,Annoying!,"Am I the only one that's noticed that this book is either poorly edited or incomplete? It refers to photos on pages that don't exist (p. 170 when the book ends at p. 160-one of many), references to recipes elswhere in the book that you can't find and some downright errors in the recipes. I thought perhaps it was just my book but I checked the library copy, too. I usually check out a book from the library before I buy; I guess I should this time, too. If someone has seen a more complete copy I would love to know."
3,Disappointed,"Was not impressed with the recipes or the stories as they reflected more of a ""Northern"" slant than a truly Southern one. Type is so small and with the British measurements given along with the American ones, it can be confusing. Of course size of type is not the author's fault. I was expecting something a whole lot better. The pictures of Sheila Ferguson's family is the best part of the book."
5,"Better than Beowulf, A must for all","Every now and then one comes across a book that evades description, let alone classification. This is just such a book and so writing a review that does it justice is a considerable task. Trowbridge has written a book which golfers will love and which us ""golf outsiders"" can certainly relate to. But this book is no mere Tiger Wood's tale, rather it is an epic poem--a modern Beowulf, only instead of the mead hall, this tale takes place on the putting greens. Wonderfully illustrated and devilishly clever this is one of those rare books that is both humorous and poetic. A real treasure."
2,Cheap in price and quality,"These are way cheaper than buying name brand needles (Addi, KnitPicks, etc.). They're rather dull-pointed, which some people might prefer, but I found hindering. The cables are rather thick, and the joining between the cable and needle is sometimes rough enough to catch my stitches. The packages are not labeled with sizes, so you have to open them all, or turn the needles in the packages to see the label and make sure you grabbed the right ones.If you need several of these needle sizes right now and money is tight, these will work. But if you can, buy just one quality cable needle now and save up for the others."
1,Bad Quality,"It's really nice to have a whole set but these are just not usable, in my opinion. The points are very blunt, the needles made out of very cheap, light wood, and the cables are very flimsy and feel like they will break. I will use them to hold projects on that I'm not currently working on and for that purpose and the cheap price maybe they are worth buying. I thought maybe I could use them to find gauge with in order to save some trips to the yarn store but they are so rough anything I knit with them won't match better quality needles. If you open the package to test them you can't return them. The DPN's are ok but not these."
3,toilet seat cover,I was hoping that it didn't go all around the seat. It gets dirty. It is washable but still inconvenient. It did come quickly. I would not get another one.
4,Made car top rack with these,"I have a truck with a shell. On the shell I have a yakama bar rack. I've made on clamp on system with rollers to hold my canoe. With these I made a second, very simple and inexpensive (compared to a yakima bike rack) rack that just clamps (actually four velco straps) onto the yakima bars."
5,Excellent bike fork mount for the money!,"The bike fork mount works really well. The nice feature is the locking. It's sturdy and for the home built bike rack that I put together this was just the item. All I needed to do was use two 2"" wood screws and mount the fork mount to a 2""x6"" and place this in the back of my truck. The fork mount is pretty secure and holds the bike firmly. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,"I liked it, but he didn't","I love Movado watches, and so does my boyfriend. I bought this one for his birthday because he wanted something nice but casual. He thought the leather band was too ""dainty"" looking. So I returned this one in exchange for the Movado Military watch, which he is very happy with. Amazon's service was great for both watches and the return."
1,Not happy,I am very disappointed because for this item to be so pricey I was not satified at all. The item is actually a womens watch and not a mens watch like I originally ordered. I would have sent it back but it was a gift and the person threw away the box and the paperwork. Never again.
2,Misleading,"The Dead segment is cool, but if you're expecting this to be an investigation into the whole acid test scene you'd be wrong. You've seen Leary do his thing before. And I'm a huge Tom Wolfe fan, but he has no reason to be taking up half of this disc. Ho hum."
3,Not to sure.,"i bought this off ebay last year and got it fairly quickly, as i am a massive Harry Potter fan i couldnt wait for it to arrive. it got to my house i ripped off the packaging and opened it up to find scribbles galore!i spent the whole afternoon rubbing out the pencil marks but ended up drawing over everything. i also found only 5 of about 20-30 stickers left,and i was told it was in ""mint condition"". i was goig to send it back but soon discovered that the seller did not take refunds and soon i just shrugged off the fact that i wasted a good $10 on another childs drawings.i was really heartbroken that someone would be so desperate to sell there 4 year old childs work that they resorted to lying.this may not help you in any form but i just felt like putting my mistake of buying it out there."
1,DVD review,This sounded like a nice story about a father and son reunion as the father was dying. It was not!! I saw it on the introduction of another DVD. It is a story of how the father bullied and ridiculed the son throughout his childhood. Totally didn't like it!!! Threw the DVD in the garbage.
4,Works Well for the Price,We purchased about 10 of these for our school. They work well with the wireless system. Need to be attentive to the installation instructions. A good buy.
1,Do not waste your time,"This wireless adapter is complete trash.I bought it a few years back, recently upgraded my RAM and the card doesn't support anything over 2 gigs.They did a recall on the same version mine is(v3) and yet I do not quality although I have the same EXACT problem as the recalled products.I phoned their support and it was an outsourced phone call(obviously), not that I have a problem with outsourced phone calls, the guy proceeded to help me and once he stated how to update my drivers although I already tried the latest drivers and on the page is lists my problem as a known issue, he proceeded to tell me he cannot help me further because he does not have the ""authorization"" because my card is too old and quickly gave me another phone number to call.I will never buy another netgear product."
3,Average performer,"Nothing special here.No matter the router (and I have been getting increasingly better and more powerful routers from Netgear) the PCs with this card installed still have average to poor connectivity. My Dell Inspiron E1505 and my Dell Axim X51v both connect better, indicating that the fault is in this adapter card.I am not really impressed, despite the ease of installation."
2,Order the right one!,"I ordered the NETGEAR WGT624 Wireless Router, and this card as a PCI connection. However, the card and the router were incompatible, which was an irritating waste of my time. I saved time by going to a brick and mortar store, locating the compatible card, and buying it there. Don't misunderstand me -- it works great now, and I'm very happy with the ease of installation. I just wish someone would have warned me that not all NETGEAR products are compatible with one another, even when they are so close to being identical.Just for the record, I ordered the WG311 54 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter, and needed the WG311T 108 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter.If someone can explain why I should have known they are incompatible, other than the adapter cannot utilize the full range of the router's capability, I'd appreciate the insight."
4,Great Product if you know what your looking for,I purchased a wireless PCI network adapter card on Ebay for ten bucks with free shipping. The listing stated it was compatable with my operating sys. It wasn't. I spent a lot of time communicating with the seller to no avail. The bottome line was the product wasn't compatable. I found the Netgear WG311 for a cheap price and gave it a try. I followed the simple installation instructions with no problems. I let the Netgear wireless management utility program manage the connection and it works great. I get approx 80% signal strength and all the speed I need with no drops or lockups.
3,Too tight for Treo 755p,"I bought this item for a Sprint Treo 755p, the latest Treo from Palm. The Treo 755p has a new ""soft-touch"" paint that improves the grip of the Treo. Unfortunately, this case is tight on the Treo because of its need to be universal and the elastic panels on the sides. With a smaller or flatter smartphone, this case might be good, but for a Treo 755p, it just didn't work at all. I needed two hands to get the Treo out of the case.Shame, because it's attractive and well made."
2,HP 635 Battery Problem,"This camera does a lot for what u have paid. I bought this camera a couple of weeks back and there were some problems with self timer 2 shots. Later I found that those problems are related to the battery and not to the software. Yes. It eats up battery very fast, which you cannot afford. I have 4 NiMH rechargable batteries with me and I can take only around 40 pictures (half of them with LCD off). Buy this camera if you are planned to use with AC adapter. Otherwise step away from this product."
5,Very Good DVD,Neal Morse gives a stunning performance on this DVD. It matches the album version perfectly and the price was very reasonable.
1,Bad Plot and Use of Dirty Words,"I started reading this book on shaky ground - Judy Blume can be intense. I stopped reading - it was totally inapropriate for even a 6th grade girl like me with use of the ""a"" word, mention of sex, and Stephanie's parents having a trial separation. I really didn't like it from the start. If you are a conservative parent on the look for child-safe books, stay away from Judy Blume."
5,an awsome book!!!,"This is one of my favorite books, becuase I like reading about friendships. It is fun to read, because sometimes in real life I've had some fights that were like the ones in the book. To read a thing happening in a book that has happened to you, helps you to understand what the book is saying. For most girls ages 10-14 years old these things have happened. In this book there are two girls who are best friends, and once you start reading this book it is hard to put down."
5,Hilarious and Touching!,"This book is a wonderful collection of quotes from children that have been overheard by grandma and grandpa. It is thoughtful, touching and just down right hilarious. I recommend this book to ANYONE: parents, grandparents, teachers, children, pastors etc. because there is something in it that we all can relate to. It maker a wonderful present and really lets your childs, or your, grandma and grandpo know you care no matter where they live."
1,Just helps you find others to teach your kid.,"If you just want to teach and help your child learn and excel in chess, this book isn't something you want. I'm from Slovenia, Europe & I bought Dans book ... and I was very dissapointed. First off all, this book is deffenetly not for Europeans as it talks about organised chess in the US & Canada. The book is essentially about how to get your kid a coach, how to get him into a club, a tournament and something on chess etiquette. I found practically nothing useful on teaching chess to my kid. I was (and still am) looking for a book on how I should do the best job at teaching my kid to play chess. And this book just isn't what I hoped for... BTW, I'm a cca. 1750 ELO player..."
2,You must be a strong believer in Christianity,"Although none of the reviews, or summaries of this book mention it, this book is intended for only the true Christians. In the preface, last paragraph, the author states this book is ""written from the Christian perspective"" and goes on to say ""and for this I make no apology"". As a non Christian, I found this book unreadable by the third page. For a Christian, I can not comment. I felt the publishers misrepresented this book and sold it under false pretenses."
5,the best,"this is the best jigger out there, one jigger does it all. it has so many different measurements you will only need one jigger, and this is the one you want"
3,"Okay, but...","Good idea to put several measures in one item. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell which line to pour to in order to get the volume you want. The steel seems a little thin too giving it a flimsy character. I use a Martha Stewart jigger from K Mart for 1-1/2 and 3/4 oz measures and an Oneida for 1 and 1/2 oz measures. Don't reach for this one anymore."
4,Preview freaks ..... UNITE!!!,"If you love corny, cheesy, fun previews from the past, then this DVD collection is for you. I think the BEST way to watch it is to sit back with a few friends, have a few beverages, and enjoy the fun. Everyone will have comments and can pan each preview. Overall a good time."
4,Good looking product,"Because it's late in the ""Grilling Season"" here, I haven't yet got to use these skewers but they seem to be of good quality and durable. They ARE magnetic though so, I wonder about the stainless steel content. I've looked (online and in stores) for a better skewer and found none quite like these.Well packaged too, would make a nice gift for someone!"
4,Good Quality Skewers,I ordered these as a gift. They are much larger than I anticipated. The person who I bought them for has used them already to make kabobs and said that they worked well.
2,The Question-Answer format makes this title a poor pick.,"Having launced a comprehensive software review & inspection process for several major corporations, most recently United Airlines, I found this particular book confusing and almost impossible as a ready reference or resource. The question-answer format provides information based on the questions the author believes you should ask, and makes referencing for specific information frustrating and time-consuming, if not impossible. The examples are elementary and lack significant value. A far better resource is ""Software Inspection,"" by Gilb and Graham; Addison-Wesley publishers."
3,Fun read!!,"Funny story at times. ""His Bodyguard"" is part of a series but it can be read as a stand alone book. While some parts of the story line are unrealistic and ridiculous, it managed to keep my attention. I recommend reading this story, but go into it with an open mind. It is fiction for a reason."
3,it's ok,not a waste of money but i hit the skip button too much to enjoy the flow of the cd. honorable mention for cd 2 towards the end it is a great cd and makes buying the set worthwhile.
1,Where's my book?,"I ordered ""Jesse James The Man and his Machines"" and got confirmation of the payment almost 4 weeks ago but have yet to see anything! I also paid $17.79 plus shipping nd handling, and now I see I can get the book for only $6.50! What in the hell is wrong with this picture and Where is my book? When you finally get around to sending it, make sure you add the $15 I lost because of you!"
1,false advertising,"I picked this up because I heard it advertised as the Gospel, which translates to ""good news."" It opens up by telling the reader how the human race is doomed because two poorly developed characters ate an apple that a snake told them to eat. That's not good news."
2,A whole lot of drama in this book,"The plot is difficult to follow, especially in the latter part of the book when we're told about the protagonist's life from four different points of view. That whole ordeal kind of reminded me of the movie ""Vantage Point,"" which I found to be equally annoying.The Dues Ex Machina ending left much to be desired. Overall it's not a bad story if you're willing to suspend your disbelief."
1,Not the best book ever.,"This book is not worth the time it takes to read! It did have a few high points, such as bears slaughtering children. Overall, though, it is mostly devoid of anything resembling high quality prose."
3,"It is ok, but there are better","This air filter isn't bad. It just isn't great either. It filters air but robs you of power. Not as much power is robbed by this filter as by others, but still not as good as K&N or even better, Purolator. Don't scrimp on your car's air filter! Get the best! Get Purolator PA24690 PureONE Air Filter instead"
1,Burn the witch!,"When are you Luddite Neanderthals going to scamper back into the jungles? I guess you could just pull the bone out of your nose, put down the crystals, drop the bloody chicken foot and join the modern age."
3,Vaccination???,"I think the title is misleading. After reading the first 40 pages I'm STIll reading about autism. If you want to know about autism this book gets rather in depth however, I was expecting more on the vaccination aspect.The book is well written and looks rather well documented. I think it's worth reading but I think the title is misleading."
5,Great product,This is a great product. Steel is good quality. The ends are well formed to avoid getting hot while on grill. Very happy with Price Vs Quality. Couldn't be better. Would recommend it.
2,"review of ""good breeding""-chunky version","This book contains striking and beautiful pictures and I would normally give it 5 stars, but the ""chunky"" format is means these wonderful photos are much too small and the book does not lay open flat to easily view the (tiny) photos. So, this book is rather disappointing; I would have paid more for a normal format book, but the only alternative to this wretched ""Chunky"" size edition is to buy a old and used hardbound copy of the original edition(which typically sell for almost $100)."
1,loooooong wait,ordered this book a loooong time ago---have yet to receive it--- when i do receive it i will rewrite a review
4,I love Jodi Picoult,"I love Jodi Picoult. She is my favorite author. All of her books are told from multiple perspectives of the different characters which adds such a wholeness to the book. I liked that this book didn't have Picoult's usual court room drama. It was a refreshing change. You really feel for the characters (and get angry at them too!) Overall, a very enjoyable book. Picoult has done it again."
3,Never quite gains momentum - not her best work,"I am an avid Jodi Picoult fan, and I have to say that this book was quite disappointing. The book never quite gained enough momentum to keep me hooked like her other ones did. Also, not a single one of her characters developed beyond a caricature of a stereotype - the woman with the past come back to haunt her, the frosty society wife with a soft side, the career-focused man who discovers he does indeed have space in his life for family. Her other books featured characters with deep flaws but who still evoked some sympathy from the reader. I couldn't find one sympathetic character in this book, and that is a problem when the story is supposed to one that appeals to your emotions."
1,Another Obnoxious Self-pitying Character from Picoult,"Ok, I'm done. I enjoyed a couple of Picoult's books, but between ""House Rules"" and now this, I've lost patience. The main character is so self-absorbed it's painful to observe. She seems to lack the most basic common sense. She behaves with a nasty disregard for anyone else's feelings and, it seems, with disregard for logic. Picoult includes a number of slice-of-life details that simply aren't accurate or reasonable, leaving me wondering if the author is not that smart. Very annoying book. I'm at the end, and it won't phase me if I finish it or not."
1,not a fan,"I am a mother of three and I was hoping to read a book that explored the many complex, and very real feelings, you have being a mother. This book sounded very interesting and I have enjoyed a lot of other Jodi Picoult books, but it was a huge disappointment. I could barely finish it the characters were so unlikeable. The big revelations in the end of the book were far-fetched and did not ""ring true"" with how the characters had been developed. I have been through many issues conceiving my children, dealing with a special needs child, feelings of guilt, feelings of inadequacy, etc. etc. and there was absolutely nothing I could empathize with in the main character of this book. The main character has been through a lot, so you think there will be a lot to empathize with, but she is so self-absorbed and the last third of the book seems to just focus on her whining and neglectful parenting. Do not bother reading this book - there are so many good ones that this is truly not worth your time."
2,This is a shallow book,"I have ready many of Jodi P. books but this was the most disappointing. It was a shallow plot with both Paige and her husband very self absorbed and Paige wanting to blame everything for many of her bad choices. Her father was an unreal character - she never visited him for 8 years, he knew where she lived but didn't visit her nor did she visit him until she was desparate. Yet he was portrayed as an outstanding father?Her listing the things she was good at on her mirror were pathetic. Nicolas was a wimp who was born with a golden spoon and was like a robot.I kept waiting for something redeeming until the very end but nothing even came close to reality. Staying w/her long lost mom for 3 months when the mom had made no effort to find her and was herself the same self absorbed person wasn't realistic either.I can only excuse this as it was one of Jodi's earlier books but it isn't even close to her other books which I have enjoyed. A waste of time."
5,Powerful and Riveting,"After buying and reading Plain Truth on a whim, I knew I had to read more of Ms Picoult's books. I found this book to a lot different than the other I had read but also another amazing surprise. I found I couldn't put the book down and was sad when it came to an end. I really enjoyed the characters and the heartache. I highly recommend this book both as a love story and life story. If you want to be moved - read this book!!"
1,a huge letdown,"I have read a number of books by this author and they have all been very good - this one, however, was horrible. I cannot believe that this book was written by a woman! So the main character, Paige, had an abortion in her teens. This has NOTHING to do with her husband later. He has no right to be upset about it and the fact that he wants to divorce her because of this is simply stupid. The fact that Paige will do anything to get him back is even worse. This book is sexist and Paige is a weak and pathetic character. I was so surprised by this ending and very disappointed."
4,"Entertaining, but a little noisy","My daughter is 7 months old and really likes this toy. There are plenty of buttons and items to play with. My only complaint is that it is just a bit too noisy, even on the quieter setting, when I try to use it to settle her in her crib for a nap or bedtime. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Pet Shop Horsing Around,"This is the toy that got the ""wow"" at Christmas from the 6 year old. It has small parts but seem to be of lasting quality and still is the ""wow"" toy."
3,"Cute, but hairless ponies not much fun",My little girl got this set for Christmas and it is really cute. The accessories are adorable and the posable pollys are great. The only problem is that the horse hair is coming out in chunks. It won't be long till the ponies have no tail and no mane.
3,Just okay,"Although this book kept me interested enough to keep reading, I just don't think it was up to par with other chick lit books I've read. I also feel like it just went downhill at the end.I would recommend it as a quick summer read, but wouldn't recommend it as great literature."
3,bought as gift,sent to africa to a friend who was doing catering. was thanked over and again but am unsure of how useful it was.
3,A bit squeaky,"If you meditate in a group and move at all during meditation, this bench might be a bit too squeaky. It's got metal hinges (come to think of it, maybe you could grease them a bit to get rid of the squeak without making a mess) to fold it down. That also makes it a little less stable.If you don't think you need to be able to fold it down, you're probably better off with a solid construction without hinges."
3,A few bits of helpful advice,"Bought this at ultra discount ($0.01) with 9 bucks shipping. Had some good tips in it for a guy who builds twig arbors for his wife's garden. Not sure I want to duplicate the trellis designs described, but I benefited from the advice on use of green wood, what kind of woods can be used, and the suggestion to use rebar tie wire. A good buy but the shipping I still consider high."
2,Making Bentwood Hearts!,"A little disappointing. Great if you want to make most things with heart shapes in it. I didn't. Good for explaining how you go about putting one together, and a few nice designs. The recipes in the back where odd - a nice idea, and i suppose better than another six pages of a heart shaped patterned trellises. Also a lot of diagrams rather than pictures - Pictures would work better i think - obviously dearer to print though."
4,Waterlady,I hve used this product before and it is made in the USA!! I checked other companies but I am more comfortable with out own products and our own liabilities.
4,Pretty Good!,"Anyone old enough to remember the glory of the Frampton Comes Alive double live album, or just love rock and roll, will love this CD. Frampton plays many of the gems off the Frampton Comes Alive double live album, some other old goodies, and some later ones, too. The music is top notch, and so is Peter. My only regret is that the auditorium in which the DVD was filmed wasn't cooler: Frampton quickly strips down to a tank top and is sweating profusely, and every time his arms come up, massively hairy armpits are revealed. In other words, the visuals are not what they might be. Neither is Peter as young as he once was. Still, some great music and great times. For Frampton's hard core fans, those who like him, and practically anyone else."
4,Fun experience but missed opportunity in storytelling,"Since I am drawn to the subject of ninjas in general, I had to check out this film no matter what. While I do not regret purchasing this DVD, for it's certainly well-produced and visually pleasing. I can't help but think that this story would've been served best by using a mini-series format that could've fleshed out the characters more thoroughly and further develop the drama and details of this saga (as hinted by the characters' histories in the Official Movie website). It was certainly a pleasant experience albeit without any real plot twists or surprises."
3,expected a lot but merely satisfied,"i believe my arcaid playing times have played a lot role in my high expectation from a movie called shinobi :D although the movie was not bad in itself because i kept my expectations very high it failed to meet thembut nevertheless i enjoyed cool coreographies, action sequences and general atmoshphere."
1,Terrible..,This movie is terrible. Blu-ray will only make this movie worse. This movie is melodramatic trash. It's shallow and pedantic.
1,backup power,"junk, dont waste your money, kept in garage, ign.keys and ign. oxidized. fuel on/off sticks have to use pliers to open, screws striped to hold gas tank, poorly written instructions. battery wiring mislabeled.no gas gauge, Generiac and Hondas have gauge. install bolts did not fit. poor assembly of wheel kit"
1,They break ... what more needs to be said?,"Unacceptably fragile ... both broke within a dozen or so uses. Used them in nothing but standard-sized wine bottles of various common varietals. Did not place any undue pressure on them to insert, but they still developed hairline cracks with a few uses, which eventually lead to complete fractures running the length of the product. Does not seem like I got a few lemons ... seems like a flat-out design flaw. Too bad, because when it comes to their stated purpose, you really couldn't lose a stray drop of wine with these if you tried. Unfortunately, staying in one piece is kind of an important feature for me. Will be trying the flexible foil-style pourers instead."
3,A good number of page came unstuck,This book is amazing and amusing for its contents. But a great number of its pages came unstuck while I was reading them and flipping through. And this was very very shameful. But I guess that to get another safe copy is more difficult than glue the pages (about 40% of the book!).Alessandro
2,The man was much more interesting,"In ""Her Majesty's Spymaster,"" Stephen Budiansky attempts to show the truth behind the Walsingham myth, by pulling together countless quotes from letters, diaries, and marginalia. Unfortunately, the attempt is lost in the telling. Even though the picture he shapes for us is a much closer representation than Hollywood gives us, the method of his delivery has much to be desired.In fact, the book is so loaded down with quotes and excerpts that it lacks any real tone or voice of its own. The end result is nothing more than a mish-mash of historical references and quips that are merely slung together in chronological order with no sense of purpose, and lacking any new insight or greater understanding of Walsingham's life or career.If you're looking for an interesting, in-depth narration of Walsingham's expansive service, this isn't it. If you want to remember why you hated history class in middle school, look no further."
3,It's Not About The Tapas,Having recently spent three weeks in Spain and one of those weeks cycling from Burgos to Santiago de Compostella I enjoyed the author's exploits and identified with many of her experiences. However at times I found some of her imagined conversations irrelevant and annoying so I found myself frequently putting the book aside.
2,Blah Blah Blah,"Polly Evans' attempt at travel writing in this book is flippant, shallow and trivial. The book reads like a crappy newspaper article with terribly over-simplified historical facts, and general disdain for the Spaniards she encounters. Better luck next time Polly!"
4,Great Quality for the Price,"It may not have a pre amp, but if you just want to rock out, it pushes 50 watts on 4 channels - so it does have some giddyup of its own.I have this headunit, a pair of XPLOD XS-GT6935A 6x9s in back and XPLOD XS-W3521 3.5"" up front.Got to tell you don't see why I would need an amp.Is plenty loud and clean.Has the auxilliary input but also plays mp3s on disks as well, so almost no need for it unless you are Die Hard IPOD person.Loading MP3s on a CD was always easier and this will read RWs, as well.Great deal at the price, but does have one tiny annoyance. When you turn the car off the unit will beep three times unless you remove the faceplate.Saw nothing in the instructions on how to turn this off.As I rarely remove the plate, I just deal with it.Again, don't hesitate to use Amazon's sellers. [...].Best of Luck to you."
1,Trash Rider,"A year ago in less than a week I read more than 30 issues of the second collection of Ghost Rider, even when I had read at least one comic of every hero of marvel, the art, the script of Ghost Rider was incredible. But all change with this last collection the magic is gone, the art is trash, the script has almost nothing to do with the old great stories, and the new John Blaze is pathetic, it don't deserve be part of the Marvel Knights"
5,Excellent performance in the British style,"Kenneth Alford is the one march composer who might be considered even more talented than Sousa. Heresy, I know, to Americans, but true.Alford's marches speak for themselves and need no commentary from me. The performance here is very much in the British style, quite different from typical American performance practice. It is apparent that a couple of reviewers here are unaware of the difference.Oh well, this is a matter of taste and experience. If you are seeking an authentic performance of Alford, this is it. If you prefer an Americanized version, this album may not satisfy."
5,It works as advertised,"I admit I don't take this everywhere- I only have it for when I really need it, but in those cases, it works like it should. I use it for my Macbook Pro 13' (2009, and I'm pretty happy with it."
5,Great Notebook Lock! Highly Recommend!,"I bought this lock for my son to take to college to help protect his new MacBook Pro laptop. It was unbelievably simple to use. Plus, I love that you can register your key number online and my son can order another key from the company if he loses both of the keys he currently has. Good quality. For the money, this is a great buy!!"
5,An easy to use deterrent,Bought this for my laptop for a 39 hour train trip because it's just one piece and had a keyed lock; I'm very satisfied. It's easy to use and doesn't add a lot of weight to my laptop bag.
5,Does the job,"Easy to use and effective. As long as your device has the Kensington slot (a small, oval-shaped slot, usually somewhere toward the back of the device) this cable will help protect it. I always take it with me when I travel. You can lock your laptop to the table or any piece of furniture so that nobody can walk off with it."
4,Great product for the $$$,"I researched several different solutions for securing my laptop at work after a few of them were stolen. Kensington products are widely regarded as the industry standard for laptop security cables, and my particular laptop (HP NC2400) was compatible. This cable also fits into my docking station, which makes it double-handy. But like many other reviewers have noted, this is not a panacea for thwarting laptop theft. I not only loop my cable through the security hole in my desk, but I also loop it through a set of mugs that I bought at my local dollar store, so if anyone tries to cut the cable, they'll make a loud ruckus. Just a suggestion to increase the efficacy of this lock for a few bucks more."
3,Amazon switched out for a cheaper model!,"I thought I was buying the Kensington 64068 but what I received from Amazon was a discontinued 64084 commercial model with an ""HP approved"" logo on the box and black HP-branded keys. It works Ok but looks cheaper than the model in the illustration. It's not worth the trouble of returning but I feel somewhat cheated since I saw an identical unit on eBay [...]."
5,Good Resource for Parents,"As a speech language pathologist, I would recommend this book to parents because it is full of useful information about your child's speech and language, as well as activity ideas to promote progress and improvement. I frequently refer my clients' parents to this book because it is easy to read and provides specifics about many common speech and language issues young children experience."
3,"nice idea, but comes off easily","This hat works great for keeping the sun off, but it comes off so easily. Even with tightening the hat, it still manages to fall in my daughter's face or come off when she is running. I so badly wanted to love this product, as it really keeps the sun off all the face. But it's just so hard to keep on..I'm not sure I would recommend it.Also, the say not to bend the rim of the hat..it arrived off Amazon having been bent in two..I'm not sure if this affected the efficacy of the product to begin with."
1,Liar,"They sold the 2nd edition while I need the 3rd edition. The book was so so bad, even though it was used"
3,perfect for my 6 y.o. son,"my son asked Santa for a different magic kit he saw in a catalog but the reviews I read about it were not very encouraging especially given the price (over $60). this kit was perfect for his skill level. like many kid's toys these days it is mostly cheap plastic and cardboard but that is fine in this context. There are a couple of key items (hat, wand, disappearing box trick) which will stand up to lots of playtime. The included dvd has good presentation of the tricks which my son can follow"
5,A BIG HIT,I got this for my grandson's 9th birthday. He loved the instructional DVD and it was a BIG hit with all 3 of my grandchildren.
4,"Magical magic set, not as good as old school, but still fine","Magical magic set, not as good as old school, I.e., Gilbert etc, but still fine...Grandson's eyes were wide open for about 1 month, some of the stuff is cheap. But its a start and the price is right."
3,Deluxe 100 Trick Magic set is Educational and Fun,I bought this magic suitcase for my 9 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. It took more days than promised to arrive after the purchase due to holiday shipping delays. My daughter is little disappointed in the sense that she could not find more than 46 tricks overall in the suitcase. This toy is promoted for children under 12 years. But my daughter thinks this toy is more suitable for children who are below 8 years of age. The DVD did not play properly for some magic tricks. Overall the DVD quality is good but it does not show all tricks. The quality of the hat and other items is okay. Additional items that are required for some magic tricks are not included in the suitcase.
5,8 year old grandson delighted,We were very impressed with the quality of this set. You reallyget your monies worth. Bought for our grandson and he was really pleased.
4,Not for the young kids,This was hard for an 8 year old to figure out on own. Plan on being the one to explain all to him. There are alot of little peices to keep together also. Overall not a bad gift.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"This Magic kit is a big joke. I didn't like at all. I ordered it for my nephew (11 years) but he didn't like it at all and not playing with it any more.This kit has few piece of papers and some plastic things which look like cheap material garbage.....performance Table is nothing but box of that kit.I would suggest don't waste your money on this kit, instead of this buy some other toys with this much of money.I would like to give '-5' star to this item.DON'T BUY IT....."
3,short cord,The cord on this joypad is about half the length of the stock joypad's cord. Cord length should be specified in product description.
3,"Pretty cheap, don't control like an OEM.","They work and are cheap, but you get what you pay for. On Zelda, the direction pad when pressing bottom right, will just randomly go top left. They are not as good quality as the OEM, but usable."
3,Civilization II Scenarios,"For the low price of this game it is good only if you are a true fanatic of Civilization. Restrictions on units and technology make for a fair challenge, however some of the scenarios are extremely easy and can be manipulated. Some of the classic manipulations(ex: being able to change governments after the new gov tech is discovered) have been changed. One should only get this game if you enjoyed the original Civ II scenarios with a passion."
1,"Same old lousy game, new package!","For SINGLE players, this is RISK, more complicated, but same game you dumped for Civ! Still CHEATS like crazy on die roll, just prettier with more rules but if you tossed Risk, you'll toss this. Spend the money on a good movie!"
2,Will not buy again,"I was really excited when I saw a mascara that I could use on my eyelashes because of my blepharitis. I just put a little on to try it and by the end of the day right before I washed it off, it was burning and I couldn't see very well. Very disappointed. Guess I'll have to go without mascara altogether."
4,EASY BUT LIMITED,"These 3 panel laminated maps by Streetwise are very handy for your vehicle for those times when you want to take a quick glance at a map and either cannot or do not want to fumble with the traditional unfolding maps or thumb through a map book looking for your desired location. However, due to it's compact size, this map is only detailed in the immediate downtown area. The remainder of the map shows major highways in the metropolitan area. So it's great to use to map out highway to highway but not good for use on your pizza delivery job."
5,Fun for all wine lovers,"This product arrived very quickly and well packaged. Constructed from heavy canvas with durable zipper; should hold up for years of rugged use. One side holds a bottle of wine and the other will either hold the included acyrlic glasses or another bottle of wine. Napkins, corkscrew and bottle stopper are included in this snug little tote. Perfect for a romantic little stop during hiking or an evening at the beach. I would strongly recommend this to friends and plan to order more as holiday gifts!"
1,Don't pay Ninty-nine bucks for this!,"This set has no special intrinsic value; it is the first half of the TZ Volume 1 DVD Collection, which only goes for seventy bucks at most retail outlets; I say again, don't pay almost one-hundred bucks for 50% of what you can have at under seventy! Additionally, there is noting special about this set; the DVDs aren't even packaged per standard--they're in CD jewl cases, loosly packed in box..."
2,BAD FILM. BAD QUALITY. BAD DISTRIBUTOR,"I NEED SAY NO MORE THAN MY TITLE. THE 2 STARS THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE FILM IS FOR THE PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY ACTOR, CLAUDE RAINS. HE WORKED WITH WHAT FEW THINGS HE HAD. The only reason rains was in the film, was to get a free holiday to Italy. I would not recommend this film, but if you are a Rains fanatic, then I would not recommend this distributor, except for maybe the Rains filmThe Evil Mind (""The Clairvoyant"") (1935)."
1,Fine Itlain Wine Book - At Last,"I have been searching long and hard for a book on Italian wines that does seek to complicated an already difficult region and Mr Belfrage has succeded with aplomb.The vineyard and wine description are concise, well laid aout and interesting to read. He raises intellegant points about producers and their wines and manages to encapsulate something of the spirit of this vast region.Three cheers and I look forward to the Tuscan series."
4,Girls just want to have fun,This was a fun book to read. I found myself laughing and turning the pages uncontrolably. I recommend this to anyone who wonders what a woman thinks about or to someone who wants to laugh at thier own thoughts.
4,laughed my way through it!,"At last! An erotic book written from a woman's point of view, with a sense of humor...I laughed my way all the way through it. A truly entertaining book!"
2,very disappointed with the Birkenstock's,"Upon recommendation of my foot doctor, I purchased a pair of Birkenstock sandals. She promised me they would be the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear. Well, they are about the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn. The arch is absolutely annoying, and causes blisters on that area of my foot. I am very unhappy with them, and will not purchase another pair, nor will I recommend them to anyone."
4,Works great.,"This stuff works great. Everyone says this is the same stuff as the John boos, but it is a little different. Most of the price difference comes from the fact that John boos uses linseed and orange oil(And others) in their product while this one is mostly mineral oil. Both are fine products, but they are not the same thing."
5,Great way to learn italian.,"After getting Ultimate Italian, I was suprised at how fast I started picking up the language. The audio cassettes are excellent and get you speaking italian quickly. To pick up a few phrases go through the lessons quickly or take your time and learn all the grammatical details. Well worth the price and should be on the top of your list if you would like to learn Italian!"
4,A good way to learn Italian,This is an excellent program for learning Italian. My only complaint is that it doesn't pause enough to allow you to think of a response when they ask you a question. I tried a few other programs and I liked this one the best.
3,Limited Usefulness,"I have now completed the first eleven lessons in Ultimate Italian. I enjoy the program of text and CDs, and certainly am learning some Italian -- the pronunciation is excellent, the text is clear and logical [but with errors! attenti!], but I find the Learn on the Go CDs almost useless. The speakers speak too rapidly; the phrases and sentences are too complex; not enough instruction is given in order for the student to reply; and there is little repetition."
5,Great starter!,"This series is excellent for beginner. The emphasis on grammar is heavy. It suits intermediate more than beginner. The ""at home"" CDs is not similar as the ""on the go"" version. I wish they were both exactly the same. Much less conversation is presented at the ""on the go"" version. Only an abbreviated version of conversation. The exercises are simple and short. Overall, it's a very good program and helpful."
4,nice album,"This album was suprisingly good. This album is unique because it is was their first single LP. It packs in a lot of music and despite the fact that it was only one disc, it still holds true to their earlier sounds. Despite what some reviewers may write, this album does sound BETTER in the remastered version. The old one is very quiet compared to the new one and it has little to no punch. Stick with the remastered version, it is well worth the money."
3,VERY CONFUSING FIRST HALF,"The first half of this book is totally confusing. It jumps from subject to subject and is VERY difficult to follow. The second half is satisfactory. If you have a choice of another biography of Prince Albert, I would strongly suggest that you buy it."
1,Not your classic Centipede,"When I bought this game, I thought I was getting the classic arcade version of Centipede that I always enjoyed playing. But this is a tricked-out 3D version that shares only the name with the original Centipede. I loaded it on my computer, played for about 15 minutes, then never went back to it. Forgot how much I disliked it the first time and loaded it on another computer, then remembered why it was sitting on the shelf. If you are looking for Centipede like you remember it from the arcade game, this is not it."
3,Ok game,This game was kind of boring. And they expect you to beat this boring game? it got like 8 worlds w/ 100's of levels each on them. I would advise you to not waste your monet on this!
1,Diarrhea and death with this product,"Esbilac changed their formula and it is causing diarrhea and death in puppies. I volunteer for a shelter, fostering orphaned puppies. Recently puppies have had severe diarrhea and failure to thrive, resulting in death. Unsure of the possible cause an internet search found this article -- [...], which indicates others also noticing a difference. After switching to Just Born formula the puppies stools are formed. Do not buy esbilac."
1,My fault for not investigating more,"Compatible for only PCs, W98 and up. Very hard to hold steady, and there is no tripod socket. More a toy than anything else"
2,oh yucky,"Ok ok, so I understand the necrophilia as a metaphor for warmongering, but that doesn't mean I want to read it. There are many better books that deal with war atrocities in a much more intelligent way. ""The Tin Drum"" for instance has all the horror, without all the ""sex with dead people"" stuff. Avoid this book....better yet, bury it in the back garden...it's internment is long overdue."
3,Good book terrible binding,"The cover on my copy is about ready to come apart and I just bought it new. However Blue of Noon is Bataille matured from his junevile Story Of The Eye, a erotic novel is facist occupied France during the second World War. I read in French class years ago and recently bought a copy."
5,Jr Archery Set,"My 8 year old grandson was overjoyed to receive this for Christmas. It will be lots of fun, but also teach him about safety and responsibility at the same time. Great product at a great price."
1,Multi-Culti Drivel,"This is just plain sloppy. Badly plotted, poorly developed, and completely contrived, this book flat out would not have been published if this were about country line dancing and written by a white woman from Oklahoma. Instead, it's written by a Latina and the subject is flamenco, so it must be good, right? Wrong. The reader who compared this to Harlequin Romances was right, but at least with those books you know what to expect. I thought I was buying a pungent onion, but it turns out it was a rotten tomato."
1,Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible,"While there are many books that provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about our culture, this novel is not one of them. A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central character, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make this the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The book is wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible and Ana Castillo is the lazy man's Sandra Cisneros."
1,The Title Says It All,"Could there be a worse title? Could it be more melodramatic? Castillo's overheated prose may sound ""poetic,"" but sentence by sentence, this novel is full of writing that rivals the worst of Danielle Steele. Castillo is a savvy business woman; an artist she is not."
3,Scrabble 2 could do better!,"Fair enough, Scrabble 2's got all the 3D features, sounds effects, games review etc., but the question players should be asking themselves is ""what dictionary is the software based on?"" Anyone who plays championship scrabble and has been to tournaments will agree with me that basing the software only on Websters OSPD isn't sufficicient; What of Chamber's Official Scrabble Word (OSW)??, What about other players dictionaries acceptable in Scrabble tournaments worldwide? I was a lot disappointed with Scrabble 2 while playing the Champion level to discover it doesn't recognise many playable scrabble words.Probably in the next version, Scrabble2 needs to be updated and equipped with these features to bring it to the same level of ratings as some current professional Chess softwares."
1,Scrabble V2.0 - No customer support = No game,"I purchased Scrabble V2.0 about eight months ago. Despite its quirks - computer challenges on words that are in its own online dictionary but ""winning"" the challenge anyway - it did help me greatly improve my score when playing with friends. I know that the ranking system in the CD is also far from accurate.Problem is, however, that there no longer is customer support for this product even though it's listed as having it. After I reinstalled W95, I encountered a problem running the game. The problem had nothing to do with the well known colors issue. Online support didn't respond and their help line never puts you through to a real person. So, my Scrabble game is useless - just a warning for others considering purchasing the game.Buyer beware."
1,No technical support,"I am an avid scrabble player and play at the expert level. My computer has all the components necessary as listed in the instructions. However, after loading I was not able to successfully set options in v.2. When I called to get help, I felt like I was running around in circles. The telphone number kept me in a loop and I was unable to contact a human being. E-mails were to no avail. E-mail addresses were changed; e-mails were never answered. I always received an electronic response that said how much the company cared about its customers, but that obviously meant nothing. The old version is far from perfect, but at least I can use it. My advice, don't buy v.2."
3,"Useful, but a little on the small side","I have a 36"" waist, but had to open this almost all the way up to get it around me. I wouldn't recommend this if your waist is any bigger than mine."
3,"Sheet,Lam","Sheet, Lam., product OK. Shipping charges excessive. Shipped via a box, when could have been shipped by a mail envelope and shipped far cheaper. Will not order from this company again."
5,Makes the best cookies.,I bought this for my husband as a fun Christmas gift. It was his favorite gift. He loves the way the cookies turn out...just a little crispy. Who cares about the handle covers. But get the conditioner. We had to go back and order.
4,"IF YOU DON'T LAUGH, YOU MUST CRY","I first read Flying Under Bridges and adored that book. The author has an uncanny ability to present very dark and disturbing topics and then disect these topics to find the absurd, the laughable. I feel the author is very good at tying together her characters and, of course, developing them fully. Whistling for Elephants is a coming of age story, a memoir of sorts of a young awkward child in a dysfunctional family finding acceptance at a zoo with the zoo's staff---all of whome have interesting lives to share. It is much more than this, but that is the bare bones! Enjoy!"
4,Break a Leg,"A tremendous outfit from the beginning of the 1980s was the relatively little known Dislocation Dance, who produced a few albums. Their best are Slip That Disc! and Music Music Music, contained here on a single disc. After that, they went soft (Midnight Shift is worth avoiding). These two are, however, both classics. Slip That Disc!'s So much fault and the incredible cover of We can work it out stand out. From Music Music, Music, check out in particular Roof is Leaking. Featuring Andy Diagram (also of the wonderful Diagram Brothers) on trumpet, these boys will get you plastered"
3,insight,the book goes into long renderings of the author's opinion regading the effect of miss translation. would have been better to go over more translation in space available.
1,Unable to use due to the outdated plug type.,"Really liked the concept of this mouse because my trackball has a really high arch that can make the middle of my hand sore. Unfortunately I was not able to plug it into any of my computers because none of them have this kind of plug (ps2) so I am unable to try it until I get an adapter that I have been looking for (for another mouse I have with this type of plug). Should have been the description. Kind of a big unit, as wide as my palm with my fingers spread apart. Not as slender as the picture looks.Update: Sept. 2, 2012So I bought an adapter for the outdated PS2 cord that converts it to a USB port and it does not work on Vista. Downloaded several different drivers and all that happened was that it disabled my keyboard and the BSOD a couple times. May try another adapter. I so want this mouse to work , I really like the features, but Kensington does not even provide the correct driver. Hopefully a different adapter might do it. Will let you know."
5,Comforting and very insightful,"Our second child is due in a month. Our first child has Down syndrome and had a lot of feeding issues in the first weeks of her life, so breastfeeding was a nightmare. I decided to give it another shot and I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is very easy to read-- VERY insightful and helpful-- and comforting. Highly recommend, as an educated woman and a soulful mother. :)"
2,Doesn't stick to the window!,"Very little care appears to have been put into this product. The first time I unrolled it to test it out, the cap on one end sprung off, so I right away had to spend a few minutes putting it back together. It's simple but a bit intricate - the first time I put it on backwards, since there's no easy way to tell, and it's harder to open up than close. Then I started putting it in my window, and it would invariably pop off within a few minutes even when the car is stopped. Sometimes when it falls, it springs apart again, too. Strong, direct sunlight definitely makes it pop off quicker, and since blocking the intense California heat is exactly what I bought it for, I'd say it's a failure."
1,There's a reason they're blowing them out...,I spent two days trying to make one of these work. No luck.
4,A Fitness Instructors friend,"This book is packed with ideas for the strength portion of a class for older adults. Some chapters seem repititive, but the volume of workout ideas makes up for it. I recommend this book for the library of any older adult fitness instructor."
3,"Well, it's cute, but maybe not worth watching twice","I usually like these ""american boy meets indian girl"" type teenage films, but this one was totally beyond predictable. I could have just watched the first 45 minutes and just written the rest myself and I would have probably came out with the same story and outcome.I liked ""Outsourced"" a lot better than this one, and the story is pretty much the same concept. Even ""Americanizing Shelley"" seems to be a better story. Aishwarya Rai's ""Mistress of Spices"" was kinda weak to me but even that story got just a little bit stronger and more appealing since I've seen ""The Other End of the Line"".The indian girl here (Shriya Saran) is, of course, gorgeous just as any indian girl in these kinds of movies are. If she wasn't so pretty, then I'd give this movie only one star.But, like I said, it's worth watching once, and it would probably make a great gift for a teenage girl."
4,"A Fun, Romantic Comedy with An Indian Accent","This film delivers exactly as advertised per its trailer at http://theotherendofthelinedvd.com/ and if you like this romantic comedy (in English with an Indian accent), you will like a similiar one called ""Outsourced"" which stars Josh Hamilton and Ayesha Dharker."
5,COLORFUL NOVELTY CANDLE,"Not only do I enjoy this ""fun"" item, but my friends think it's a delight, too. It's what I call a ""cheap thrill"". It has been long-lasting following the instructions to keep it in the dark (in the orginal box does it). And it arrived promptly."
1,Not really a photography book more like digital imaging.,"I've already passed the middle of the book and it's basically another Photoshop book. I knew that photo editing would be a part of the book but not the whole thing. In addition, they are not very good Photoshop tips you are better off just getting a Scott Kelby book for editing or Shoot like a Pro by Julie Adair King to learn digital photography basics."
2,You need more than just this book...,"While the History Pocket books are great for making a book, they are a little boring by themselves. There is too much coloring and not enough learning. We have learned more by reading library books, the encyclopedia, watching an educational show, or talking about the subjects.When we purchased these, I liked the idea. But, after wasting a lot of our homeschool day with the children coloring (by day 3, coloring had turned into scribbles) I decided to use these as supplemental activities. We read and do art projects. We talk about the subjects. We did the puppets and had my daughter write postcards. The kids chose which ones looked ""fun"", and skipped the rest.While it is nice to have a book to look at afterwards, I feel they do not serve a great purpose. They are nice if you need a ""work sample"" for school, but I feel they are just ""busy work"". History can be learned in much more interesting ways."
3,Not what I expected,"The construction of this item leaves something to be desired. The workmanship on the basket is average at best. The ""liner"" is plastic and designed so that water cannot drip through. However, the metal chain holding the basket is somewhat flimsy and immediately made me suspicious of its being able to support the weight of dirt/live plants/watering, which is why I bought this item in the first place. As a result, I chose to put artificial plants in the baskets instead. In addition, the chain is fairly short, so in hanging them from my patio rafters, I was pretty much forced to add a decorative hanger for additional length. The overall effect with the artificial flowers is nice, but I had wanted to be able to plant in them, which is why if I had this to do over, I wouldn't. Also, I wouldn't recommend paying more than the $7.99 (plus free shipping and no tax)."
4,does what it should,"I have had this for almost 3 years now and so far have been happy. Had it attached to a car that I seldom drove and it kept the battery charged enough to start it after extended periods of time. Was curious about if it was actually producing what it was rated for, so I checked it out. It was putting out @22-24 volts and 220 ma. So it is putting out about 110 ma less than rated. Not really that upset about it. The reasoning for this is that the panel and the stand I had it on got blown about 20 feet in a nor'easter we had 18 months ago. Checked it out, after I realized that I had left it outside and it still worked. The frame cracked, but the panel itself was intact. Just happy that it was still working. Right now I am in the process of hard wiring it to my truck. Overall pretty pleased."
2,"Great product, new cars defeat it","The product itself is great. I own several. They used to work wonderfully, but my newer cars disconnect the lighter socket when they are not running. Therefore, the charger doesn't do anything. Yes, I could get the lighter socket rewired. The thing I loved about this was how easy it was. Taking my car in to be rewired to use it is not what I consider easy.Great Product. Lousy new cars."
1,RIP OFF.,THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT IT DRAINS THE BATTERY IF YOU LEAVE IT CONNECTED WHEN THE SUN STARTS TO FADE. IT'S ONLY GOOD WHEN THE SUN IS AT ITS PEAK THEN THE BATTERY WILL START DRAINING AS THE SUN GOES DOWN.. EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH BUT AT LEAST IT ARRIVED ON TIME SO ONE STAR.
1,bad investment,won't even turn a 12v dc fan in direct sunlight. Put a 9v battery on th fan and it tries to take off.
5,Amazing,It is amazing how true and vivid a book can be. Brought up memories - I lived in a Soviet satellite country - and showed that evil needs to be remembered.
5,"Delightful, engrossing. We want MORE.","This book will demand that you re-shuffle your schedule in order to accommodate the drama and tension in its pages. In short, this was a page-turner. Though it may seem cliche to compare this with Stephen King, nevertheless it does lend itself to such standards. In reading it, I found myself also thinking of Frank E. Perretti's novels as well. The characters are well constructed, the pace is lively and one quickly sinks into the quicksand of thought, feeling and words, with little regard to time. (And speaking of being late for appointments, you can't be late if you don't show up!) There are some well turned phrases in the book too, which are refreshing and delightful."
4,Wither will get you,"I really loved this book. If you're into horror stories with a little supernatural craziness, this book will have you hooked. Also look for Wither's Rain(book 2) and Wither's Legacy(book 3)."
3,"Fine, but faaaaaaaar from fantastic","A masterpiece?Not likely. It should make a box-office hit;in fact it seems planned that way. A good weekend book, but if I mustbe honest, I hoped better and quite frankly it was too expensive for what it is. Wait for the paperback."
2,Weak and slow,"When I ordered this book, I was hoping to read a scarey, chilling book. I was wrong. Certain parts of this book were entertaining, but most of what I read was a disappointment. It had a weak plot, a weak ending, and weak characters. It lacked some sort of stability to keep my mind focused. I was disappointed."
5,Fascinating Read,This book was fascinating. I loved the way all of the characters were connected and interwoven. I would also like to say that I am a Wiccan and this book does my religion justice. The plot was spellbinding and the characters were rich and well developed. I could not put it down. I would love for this book to be made into a movie because it would be amazing to see on the big screen. Pick up Wither! You'll be glad you did.
3,Game,I really like these games however I wasnt able to install all the games on this cd. If I was able to install everything I would like that better.
3,Older game,Game plays OK however on newer moniyor with Win 7 the colors aren't correct nowr does the mouse work just right.And older game and the price was right.
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7,Did not work on Windows 7. Normally a great series otherwise. I wish there would be an easy fix but spent hours trying to find a update or something with no luck.
1,Command & Conquer The First Decade,"I would advise strongly against purchasing this game. EA hastaken this great game series, built for Windows 95 and re-released the series for XP, WITHOUT CORRECTING thecompatibility issues that prevented playing the orignial series on XP.So for your money you get a bug infested series of games thatcrash and lock up your system, even with the patches installed.It is a real tragedy and a testament to the high profit motive and poor game quality integrity of EA Games.P.S. Read the reviews before you buy. If you read any reviewsfrom people praising this release as wonderful and perfect, youwill know whose pocket they're in!"
5,Command and Conquer the World,"For those of you wondering whether or not to buy the whole set of C&C games or just pick and choose them individually, buy this! Take the plunge and get the whole set, you will not be sorry. This collection inculdes such classic moments as the rebirth of Kane, the Soviet invasion of Iraq, and the Yuri's demise at the hands of a T-Rex. It's the best game I ever purchased."
1,Very disappointing,"Should have been a great game, just too many monstrous flaws. If I had bought it from a store I would have returned it. One section of 2 games would not work at all. The first 2 had a mission that could not be beaten and on a time limit and no cheats and no way to go past it so about 4-5 of the games were only half doable. Got to the next to last game and it is set to going so fast as to be undoable and no way to slow it down. Tanks move at 100 miles per hour. Still haven't tried the last set.Total ripoff...and there seems to be NO support anywhere. Don't buy games on-line from Amazon, good service, just lousy product."
1,Too many bugs.,I love the C&C series but this packaged version has way too many bugs in it which make some of the games unplayble.
4,all rolled into one,c&c is one of my favorite rts games and you dont get one not two not three but like 10 games. all rolled into one and just for 20 bux you get to play .the original command and conquer i felt old.i have not played that in years back wen it was on ps1 ond old computers. i felt old from how long it was that i seen it or even played it just one thing dont keep puting it back in the case its really crappy and it keeps chiping the inside of the cd so put in a soft case like i did it will last longer and you get a cool little poster with it. i dont know why you get a poster you just do and you get a bonuse cd/dvd that has extra videos and fan art a must buy for c&c fans or. if you really just like rts games i give it a 9.6 it lost .4 cuz of the case i hate crappy cases.
1,If you have anything over Windows xp dont get it.,I recently got the game and all of the old stuff does not work. My pc is to new. EA should do a better job. Its just roms on a dvd. If you have windows 7 you'll be lucky if you even get generals to work.
1,This Compillation is Very Bad,"This collection of games is not fully updated for XP. Network play was removed from two early games (C&C; Dawn and Red Alert), movies are missing (Red Alert), soundtracks are missing (C&C; Covert Ops), bugs that weren't seen before are appearing (game freezing when the mouse is moved to the top right hand corner of the screen), the secret dino missions appear to be gone. The DVD of extras (interviews) is being met with luke warm to negative reception.Some people that have the original games are copying the code from their old game CDs in an attempt to patch the versions in C&C; X. Electronic Arts has been mostly silent about issuing any patchs after days of complaints on their bulletin board.The games don't really appear to be ""updated for XP"" at all as features have been removed and there are some bad bugs. This compilation is less than the sum of the old original games.Read the bulletin board over at www.westwood.com if you don't beleive me."
3,Good but incomplete,I give this compilation three stars becauseI'm disapointed that Sisqo's Got To Get itvideo is not included.Neither are his two videos Can I Live andDance For Me from the Return of The Dragon album.Island home video could've done better. Scott
4,Good Product,"The soft case is pretty good, it is very roomy and with a nice side pocket for extra heads or whatever. I just wish I had a bigger bow, but that can changed. I recommend it too anyone being on a budget but not wanting to sacrifice quality."
1,"First they jam, second the don't break open","These suck. They jam in the gun because they are too soft and sticky to load and fire right. Second they are shot too slow for the thick skin to break, and so overall these are a sucky product. If you want to shoot paint, buy a paintball gun, these are a waste of money. If you want to waste money, bring it all to Channel Islands High School in California and leave it for me at the front office, then you will have wasted money getting to my work, and you'll have wasted more simply giving it to me."
1,This sucks,"I bought this product for about 9 dollars thinking it would be pretty cool to shoot paint out of my gun. Well these didnt clogg in my gun, but they werent a circle but more egg shaped. I went to test them and at point blank these would not break . After many shots no matter what these wouldnt break. Finally I had to break the paint open with a needle in order to draw paint which still wasnt easy. This was the biggest waist of money i have ever made. If you buy this product you are a moron."
3,Squish too easily for my gun.,I don't know if they would work in other guns or not - I have a pistol with a magazine-style clip and it is not possible to load these into it.
3,Home made sodas is a rare find,This book is a rarity. The recipes helps give me good ideas on what to try next with make my own sodas.
4,Very Enjoyable Quick Read,"Very, enjoyable, quick read. Perfect for summer beach or pool reading. A gay teen's adventures, and misadventures, on his prom night. Imagine John Hughes doing a gay teen angst movie and you can visualize this story. If there is any shortcoming in this story, it is that the author tries to stuff too many events in to too short a time. Yes, when things go bad they can really go bad, but let's be realistic here."
3,base could be taller,"I bought these for our annual Christmas-day lobster dinner party, and they were fantastic, but the base was a little too short. Once the butter is completely melted and hot, it begins to actually boil and bubble due to the direct flame. If the base was an inch taller it might warm it comfortably for a longer time, but we found we had to keep putting the candles out and relighting them. Have utility lighters on hand. The handles worked perfectly for our purposes though, as there were a lot of people sharing the butter and they could pour as much on as they liked and move on."
1,Save your time and money,"We rented the DVD out of curiosity. This movie was bad. Actually embarrassing. Bad acting and naive plot. Amir (the detective) was the best actor. The others were like high-school drama students. We were mainly interested in seeing the locales filmed here in DC (and maybe the hot men). But otherwise, pretty boring, and we fast-forwarded through a lot of it."
2,"Chills okay, but ""chill cells"" are oozing.","The product works ok, but then we don't like our Chardonnay super cold either. I'm not so sure that an ice bucket filled with ice and water wouldn't do the same thing in just slightly more time. (You might want to try that before buying this chiller.) My primary reason for writing this review is to say that after about 3-4 months of intermittent use, the chill cells are oozing out freezer gel. They say it's ""food safe"", but nonetheless, that shouldn't happen. I'll contact Brevelle & hopefully, they'll make it right."
1,Does nothing in 7 minutes,"I tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm. They say chill, but what does that really mean? They should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes. I guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer. Also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this on a whim, as a gift. It's certainly not all it claims to be; neither is it a total failure. Ten minutes gives you reasonably cool wine.In my book, three stars is a typical, average product. This gizmo loses a point for being $50 instead of $15."
5,I love mine!!!,"I received this item as a gift last christmas. We loved it. We are avid wine drinkers and collectors, mostly reds though, so I did not have alot of space in my wine fridge for whites (and the temp is set for my reds). This was a great gift for us, I find it gets VERY cold VERY fast. It even puts a little more chill on my wine than suits my palate, however, my husband does like his colder than I do, so I pour first and replace to chill a little longer for him. I too am very shocked at the low stars for this product. I am trying to find more to give as gifts this year."
5,The Best Gilligan's Island Book I have ever read!!,This book is packed with information about Gilligan's Island . This book tells how Mr. Schwartz picked each member on Gilligan's Island. It to him awhile to find the right Skipper. But then he went to a resturant he found the perfect Skipper! This book is great you have to read it to put how good the book really is in words!
4,READ IT!,"This book is very good and at least we know more about Senna not that I like her one bit more, if NEthing I hate her more. She's manipulative, stupid and pathetic. Really she is. She still using David but at least Christopher is free from her. Mainly I like this book coz April is telling it and she has pretty good insights. But I got a feeling that she likes David. *sigh* I hope not. I personally don't like him much. NEways back to this book. There R knights from the Round Table and Merlin (the wizard) and we find out Y Senna is so important in all this something I totally didn't see coming. READ IT!!! But as someone said it's too short."
2,Don't bother,It was a little slow and boring at time and the ending was the worst!! Would not recommend unless you don't mind knowing what happens at the end
4,OK,"Movie itself was ok.. a little quirky for my taste.I had a hard time watchign it because wireless connection was shaky.overall, an okay purchase."
4,great movie,I really enjoyed this movie. One of the main characters for me was the Puget Sound region and it's beauty. It's an incredibly romantic place and really added to story for me.
1,"S-L-O-W, painfully so","I was very bored -- it was SO SLOW! And then there was the lack of an actual ending... Love Emily Blunt, but even she couldn't keep me interested in this film."
5,Refreshing & Funny,"If your looking for a well acted, well written adult movie this is a great choice. Your Sister's Sister is a very funny at times serious movie about relationships, loss and love. The cast is a perfect match and the acting is honest, real and sincere. Highly recommend it."
4,good movie,"good movie, i really enjoyed it you should watch it im only writing this cause it said 18 words or more..."
4,Your Sister's Sister,A unique and fresh faced look at a complicated romantic situation. Emily Blunt is one of my favorites and she always delivers a superb performance. The two other actors are worth watching too. I enjoyed it a great deal.
1,What a joke!,"Seriously, that was the most ridiculous movie I have seen. The absurdity of every plot point is just staggering. The lack of truth and honesty about how the world and the people in them work together is absolutely mind-boggling -- it's amazing there is gravity on this fictional earth they have created in this film."
3,Unexpected twists,"This movie moved a bit slow for me, but there were a couple of unexpected twists. Actors played their parts well. A bit unbelievable at times. Also beautiful scenery at the film location."
2,Too slow paced for my tastes,"I'm sure there is a good movie here if you are willing to fight though it, but when I sat down to watch it I lost interest around half way through and did other things instead."
4,Believable characters,The acting is good in the sense that it's easy to imagine these are real people. The story is interesting though they don't wrap the ending in a neat bow if that matters to you. (I thought the ending was fine but my wife wanted something more complete.
4,Great movie,I've been dying to see this movie for a long time and it didn't dissapoint. I was sad when it was over and would've liked to see the relationships unfold. The main guy character is a real talent and I think his career is booming - I just saw him have a small role in Zero Dark Thirty.
2,"Warning, movie has no ending","It was a decent enough movie up until the ending because there was no ending. They revolve the whole movie around a storyline and then they just leave you hanging at the end with no resolution of it. That isn't entertainment to me, it's flat out annoying. It's good when a movie gets you thinking and talking, and this one did, but it's not good when you have to think hmmm, I wonder how that movie ended and what happened to those people."
1,Diet Detox book is a ripoff,"I bought the book and kept on thinking ok, ok, but where's the beef --sorry - i mean the juice. The book is nothing more than a promo piece to step you up to the next level to buy the kit for $199. Roni talks of juices and soups but its only when you go to the website you realize you have to buy it all from her.Save your money!"
4,Lots of information,INformation packed book makes you take a closer look at what you are eating....have not begun the process...very complicated...
3,Need Money,"It started out good,but,then theres so much Stuff you need to buy! I just don't have the money! I didn't even finish reading because of that! But,when I get money I'll buy a juicer!"
1,You don't need this book to do it !,"I saw the documentary ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"" and decided to get healthy. I bought this book because Amazon recommended it when I bought my juicer. There is about 1% of information for a juice diet, and NO juicer recipes. As far as the detox diet that she tries to push, you need to spend HUNDREDS of $$ in supplies. Chi machine, water distilling machine, Enema equipment, colonics, special massages, and the list goes on. The book goes into the science of detox, and then again into the science of detox, and again into the science....... OK, we got it, poison in our cells, detox by fresh vegetables...This could be summed up in one chapter, but is stretched out for over 100 pages. Also, it's filled with testimonials. How many stories do I need to hear about other peoples diets? Boring! Save your time and money. Buy a juicer, some fruits and vegetables, and start juicing. See ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"". You don't need this book to get healthy."
2,If you work do not even try!!,"Unless you have the freedom of not working or having children don't even try this diet. Also if you do not have the money to buy a juicer or if you do not have a Health Food Grocer near by good luck trying to get all the correct juices required. Otherwise I would make this a great diet to do, but only if I did not have all the little things that get in my way."
2,Be careful,"Before this book came out there was an article about it in the Women's World magazine. In fact on the jacket of the book it reads, ""As seen in Women's World."" I ordered the book after reading about the diet in the magazine. It sounded like a great way to go but I was disapointed. After reading the book I realized that someone was trying to hide the fact that this diet is extremely difficult if not imposible to do on your own. The book's author runs a detox center, where, if you want to spend thousands of dollars you will have someone waiting on you hand and foot while you do the diet. That is about the only way you are going to do the diet. The supplements taste terrible and are very expensive. The book never talks about that of course. In fact I believe the author of the book tried to hide many facts about the diet deep inside the book or left them out completely. So, be careful, it's not what it seems. The book was poorly written in my opinion."
1,Yuck -triple yuck and yuck!!!,"To start - it sounds great. Lots of healthy fruits, veggies... reality is it is so disgusting! And they never really tell you what to do. There are clues throughout the book - but you really have to look for them. A friend did this diet and she looks unbelievable and feels unbelievable. After 2 days my gag reflex wouldn't stop. The upside is that any other way of eating to benefit your health after this one is pure bliss! I haven't cheated on my new diet in 3.5 weeks. Just thinking about the Diet detox keeps me on the straight and narrow!-"
1,Sadly Surprised,"I was very disappointed to discover that this book was not an easy book to follow. I was hoping for a user friendly detox program. I wasted my money, I wish I could send the book back!"
1,Save Your Money,"This book is nothing but a huge commercial for the website and detox hotel they run. If you do check out their site online, the 'kit' to go with the diet is $199! You can get the same of everything they sell for a total of about 60 bucks at GNC online.All of the information they offer on doing a juice fast is available for free. Look it up on google and there's a ton of valuable information that goes further in-depth than this book could ever hope to. I also went to my local library and found a couple of books which were much more helpful. None of the other information I've seen regarding juice fasting includes daily enemas or taking supplements/powders."
1,A poor effort,"There's nothing better than settling down on a winter's night with a good thriller, but this isn't it. From a promising start this book degenerates into flabby writing, cliched and unbelieveable characterisation and a plot that moves at a snail's pace. I couldn't finish it, and don't know if I will read another of Ms Cole's efforts. Disappointing."
1,Clue is a mystery,"This game has excellent graphics and was fun to play UNTIL the problems began. If you have time to waste downloading a patch from Hasbro Interactive, (didn't work for my game), and restarting from the beginning, then it probably would be a very good game. I never did make it to the end of the game. I returned Clue for another title. I'm a fan of mystery, but this game was too much of a ""mystery"" getting it to work for me. Better luck to you."
2,Too Many Crashes,"I was frustrated by this game, because it was actually so much fun. However, I finally gave up on it; too many crashes."
2,Lazy orbit review,"I purchased the Kensington Orbit because I have Arthritis in my hands. I have tried to download the mouseworks' software from the web. I was unable to do so. Thusly, I am writing about the Orbit. I have to move the trackball several strokes to get it to move the arrow to move. I have an Ibook and this insures me a small screen, but I have to move the ball too much. I am very unhappy with the outcome of the Orbit Trackbball"
5,Perfect gift,"These prints are some of my favorites, I have probably 5 or 6 of them in my house. Go out and buy a nice frame and they make a fabulous wedding gift. Great product. Love the work of Timothy Botts!"
5,"Top, top stuff","Zombies, werewolves and vampires getting hunted down by a specialist police task force. Sounds like another lame attempt at cashing in on undead-zeitgeist/teen-angst, right? Nope. None of that. You're gonna love it. Genuinely funny, peerless dead pan delivery, really great cast. Terrific writing. More please."
4,Works well enough,"Certainly mounts securely to my truck bedrails. However the axle compression mechanism was a little off. It works fine for my purposes, but I wouldnt trust it to hold a $3k mountain bike from thieves in downtown (city).If all you are trying to do is transport a few bikes for the family or friends from the garage to the bike path, trails whatever this should be more than adequate. If you rely on your bike fork carrier for theft protection, invest in something from a larger company like Yakima or Thule."
4,Informative,"I purchased a 3 dvd set that I was very disappointed in. This 1 dvd was very good. It covered the spiritual & practical benefits of Tantric lovemaking. It also had real everyday people discussing the emotions everyone has both male & female regarding sex in general & the change Tantric Lovemaking brought to their views on the subject. Very tasteful & would recommend it to everyone whether they are in a long term relationship or single. Very healthy all around. Tastefully done & down to earth. This covers all aspects. Physical, emotional & spiritual & how to apply some or all in every ones life while still dealing with work, family & all the other daily life issues."
2,Embarrassed to give this as gift,"Read the reviews prior and actually believed them. This candle is fine if you follow the adage you get what you pay for but there is no way I am giving this as a gift as I had intended. The presentation box is nice but everything goes down hill from there, The candle feels cheap and flimsy (would expect this quality from the dollar store). The lid isn't much better. Do yourself a favor and pay those extra bucks from something worth your while"
2,weak scent,The Lollia collection was highly recommended to me so I was very happy to see it in sample sizes. I purchased about 5 different scents from this collection and was sorely disappointed! Not one of these fragrances had any staying power!! Imagine that these sample sizes were eau de perfume!I would not recommend this line because it is expensive and definitely not worth it.
5,"Hard, but very good","Vietman Line of Sight is a very good game, but it is hard, as the real war was. I enjoy playing the game very much. It is very real."
3,"I should have known, but no rack included","I should have known, but no rack included. At least it is bigger than I expected. Probably about 8 beers."
4,Bike Bag,"This bag is small, but fits nicely and securely on my back rack. Perfect for my rides along the Hudson River Greenway! Holds my chain, a few tools, water bottle and maybe a picnic lunch too! Sturdy and well made . . . good buy for the price. Love it!"
3,"Worthwhile reading, but....","I believe in value investing and it's importance as a componenet of a well rounded asset allocation. The lower betas that usually accompany such stocks can be of added significance for the retired investors who should exercise more caution in the risk/reward area. I found this book worthwhile reading, but probably more than the average investor needs to know about the subject. Recommended for the person who plans on buying individual stocks, everyone else can get a prospectus from Tweedy Brown( Chris Browns company) that will tell them most of what they need to know in a few pages."
1,"Mediocre at best, interesting digressions",I found this book could be summarized with one sheet of paper covering historical ways of looking at value investing. It was more of a trip down memory lane for the author as he reminisced about famous investors he knew of rather than successful value investing strategies that can be applied today. The first half of the book could easily have been condensed into one chapter and I felt the second half should have been expanded upon but instead left the reader wanting more details that maybe the author did not have.
2,too tight,"The sandal is very cute. Even though I got a size larger and a ""Wide"", the center part of the strap leaves a mark on my son's foot and hurts him so he won't wear the shoe. Bummer!"
5,Beatiful quality watch,"I bought this as a gift for the woman in my life. She absolutely loved it. The watch is a quality piece and looks excellent. She has had it for years now, and it has held up excellent. No signs of wear and it still gets used a lot. She and I could not be happier with the watch."
5,Excellent! Very Happy.,"I love this watch!!! it's classy, unique and versatile, I even bought my boyfriend the matching one. Needless to say I was very disappointed when I lost it one night. So I went on a mission to find the exact same one. I looked everywhere and I was told that the model was discontinued in the stores, until I stumbled upon this site. I was hesitant at first since I live in Toronto and didn't want to pay crazy customs fees or wait forever for delivery...but I took a chance because I really wanted this watch again. To my surprise, it came within a couple of days and the prices are reasonable, I'm totally impressed. Now I'm a fan Amazon.com, they have everything one can think of, I wish the Amazon.ca one was like that!"
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,Unless you're doing a long cable run or afraid trendy people will check to see what kind of cable you use then this hdmi cable will treat you just fine. Great price... although the shipping is as much as the cable which can't possibly be true.
5,Satisfied Customer,"The product wasn't packaged the way the webpage stated it should be, with the tripp lite label. However, upon my contact with the company they responded immediately. Because of their prompt serious I gave them 5 stars even though I.m not sure what product I received."
2,I HUNG IN AN STUCK THIS ONE OUT BARELY!!!!,"I don't like to write negative reviews. This one is hard to describe. It's not that it's so bad as it is that there are so many little subplots running around that you lose sight of the reason you are reading this one. ROMANCE, FUN, ENJOYMENT, RELAXATION are a few in case you forget.I found that the constant back and forth between Katie and Branch made me want to slap them both silly. This would have been a better read if it was shorter with less, of his willy-nilly he's going home to River Run and he's not taking Katie and he doesn't really like her.I hung on and finished this one but I was about ready to archive it and forget it as a bad start.HINT!! HINT!! Romance means good hot sexy interaction. Not fighting and bickering and running away. If I wanted that I could just not read and deal with my real Life.READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.!!!!"
3,Flashes of inspiration,"I love techno music, and I like opera too. I first realized these two could be combined for a pleasing effect when I watched the horrible-but-wonderful movie Johnny Mnemonic, in which there is a brief club scene where an opera singer performs with electronica accompaniment. Flash forward to about a month ago, when I bought this album hoping for more of that. And some of it is great...particularly Habanera and the title track. Most of the rest of the album is a throwback to the Mannheim Steamroller era of synth music, sometimes not married very well to the operatic voices which it is supposed to be enhancing. It's not horrible, but it's neither workout- nor meditation-worthy.My advice? Find the album digitally and preview the tracks to see which ones strike your fancy, but there's no need to buy the whole album."
1,Poor quality,"This product is a poor substitute for the Skip and Hop brand. We lost our two year old's skip and hop and went for the cheaper product, figuring it would be in use for a short time. Sorry I decided to go cheap. The fabric doesn't wipe clean (nasty), it is smaller, and less well put together. Go for the skip and hop for ten dollars more."
5,Punisher at his best,This is a great book for any punisher fan. In it the Punisher infiltrates the mob. The art was great and it read like a great mafia story. Great for anyone who likes movies like the Godfather or Scarface. It has some great Punisher moments. It is definitely worth reading for any Punisher fan.
3,The only good Punisher Dixon ever did.,"The last few issue is what killed it. With the story and art taking a complete nose dive. Well the art from the beginning by John Romita Jr wasn't really that good anyway. The Punisher and everybody in the story were just drawn too big. This Punisher story is just basically the ""Raw Deal"" movie turned into a comic book story. But this whole story just got a little too weird and too dumb."
4,Good general purpose cymbal pad,"These are the best general usage cymbal pads available, and work for marching cymbals all the way to orchestra crash cymbals. Zildjian is a reputable brand, and these will be a great addition to any set of crashes without pads. Felt pads are generally a better choice than leather, as they are not just cheaper but softer and easier to play with. They don't last as long though, so expect to replace them every so often.As a side note, the best pads ever made have been discontinued - a woven (stuffed) felt pad, similar to the wool cymbal pads still available. As an alumni of the University of Michigan cymbal line, I can tell you those were the best. Since those have been discontinued, these are now the closest replacement."
5,Love this item,I haven't used the GPS locator yet but I have used the heart rate monitor several times and love it.
1,Doesn't work in the mountains,"The heart rate monitor is very simple to use and works great. This instrument also tells time, but that's it. When skiing in the mountains, it just plain doesn't work. If you bet your life on the gps coordinates getting you back to the parking lot in fog, they would find tour new watch frozen to your inert body. I have a Garmin product that actually picks up satellite signals, this watch does not. Even on a mellow cross country outing, the gps fails 50% of the time, at best. I can't even imagine it working properly amongst high buildings."
4,gameboy on the move!,"It's totally awesome to have the ability to play gameboy while on the road without having to waste batteries! I dont have to worry about my batteries wearing out and losing my game! How ever, every once in awhile the cord to this adaptor (and others on the market) can come unhooked. Maybe in the future the manufacturers will add a strap to hold the plug in the game!"
4,Nice,"The phone stand is great. The only disappointment was the file holder in the back. It is just a small attachment and it falls off and barely works the way I'd hoped. There is a gap between my desk and the wall and this just kept falling into it since it wasn't actually attached to the rest of the stand.Otherwise, it's great! Looks and works just like it seems it would. Plenty of space for storing office utensils and the area underneath even has a little shelf for separating documents. Nice."
5,A good find!,"Cleaning out some bookshelves the other day (a never-ending task), I found this book which I bought some months ago. So I read it yesterday (it is just 96 pages) and even though I know quite a bit about Van Gogh, this was still a delight. Walther combines biography, paintings and analysis of them, and discussion of Van Gogh's techniques. I especially liked the illustrated time line at the end.Very well done. This author clearly knows his art and artists. Great find!"
3,It is a great and inspirational book for youth,"My son read this and seem to be impressed and attentive to the writer views since he is of African ethnicity and can relate to what young black males go through. I really considered the fact that for a person to take the time and write a book concerning the need to relate and instill his value system in teenagers that he sees himself through, his heart has to be passionate for males that are walking in the path he has traveled. I applaud him to want to reach back to the community. I think his book should have been publicized and promoted more for the mainstream crowd more and it was not. Perhaps that should have even been a few given free to allow the people that may want some inspiration (postive) to be able to read it."
3,dvd,the only thing i had trouble with was the dvd player did not work. but the projector works great
3,Toy's for kids? Only is kids have poor vision.,This toy has subpar resolution. It projects an image that is lower in quality than what children and adults alike are familiar with.
4,Zoom Box DVD,"The Zoom box came in very quickly. The body of it looks awesome, the sound is even good but the quality on the wall wasnt as sharp/clean as I expected. My fiance and I are very big into playing video games and didnt find the quality on the wall to be as sharp/clean cut as we had hoped even though we have messed with the settings it still wasnt coming out the way we thought. We will be using the zoom box to display our photos on the wall at our wedding reception."
4,Zoombox DVD Entertainment Projector,"I purchased this for my 9 year old son as a Christmas gift. It was the only thing he wanted. I purchased 3 plug & play games for him to use with the Zoombox. The zoombox is easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good. I think the product is overpriced and should include a plug & play game or a dvd. Other than that, he ejoys it and it is portable."
2,"Don't Bother, not even for the kids","Okay, I had a chance to try out my new Zoombox. Result: good sound, works well, very nice color on my matte grey bedroom walls... BAD SCREEN RESOLUTION. The resolution was so low that the pixels were very, very obvious. Now, though I like Spiderman, seeing webs on my movie screen isn't a good thing when they aren't part of the movie's special effects! So, I'm sending it back. We'll just have to make do with our TV."
3,Mental Health,"messy!too colorful (purple, pink, yellow, orange, ...) pages due to highlight pens. I don't like it. What color pen I can highlight in the book ?????"
1,"Fake, Wannabe-Ghetto-Cool Bible","Why do publishers feel like they need to FOOL kids and teenagers into thinking the Bible is some Rolling Stone-like magazine with gangster-wannabe catch phrases inserted on every page? When you get to the content, Matthew 1:1 is still Matthew 1:1, regardless of the deceptive phrases on the cover.If the choice for kids is coming down to buying NO Bible or buying one that ""looks"" cool on the outside, then they are not going to be reading this Bible for long. In the meanwhile, we're only advancing the idea that you SHOULD judge a book by its cover.An edition for teens is one thing, an edition that is flat out deceiving? Terrible, terrible idea. What's next? The swimsuit edition?"
3,One of the better flight sim war games,"I've probably seen all of them from the WWII era, from the old 1942 Pacific air war to IL-2 Sturmovik. This is one of the most entertaining. It flies pretty well and the graphics are almost as good as some of the later ones. It has given me a lot of pleasure.I rank the best ones as follows: IL-2 (Sturmovik); Janes WWII Fighters; Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2 (Pacific Theater); Microsoft's Flight Simulator (WWII Europe Series); and finally this one: European Air War,by Microprose.My ranking is based on quality of graphics, smoothness of manuever with a good computer (mine is a 1.8 Ghz Gateway Pentium 4 with a half-gig of RAM and ATI) and the flight modelingof the aircraft (how close to the real aircraft they are in their performance). My judgment on the latter is based on the fact that I have flown a variety of real prop driven aircraft since I soloed in 1946, as well as many radio-controlled models.Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)"
4,Another goodie,In this outing Francesca and John are involved in the murder of a restauranteer. This series just gets better and better. The characters are very human.
4,Good Supplement to Japanese Classes,"This system covers a very wide variety of topics, the CDs are well-executed and the manual is very organized. Being a fourth year student, I found it to be an excellent supplement/review to the material I was learning in class. However, it would be difficult to teach yourself with this system. It is mostly all romanji with some hiragana, katakana and kanji thrown in here and there. The CDs, while very helpful, tend to be a bit dull.Overall, I would highly recommend this to any current student as a comprehensive supplement to do on your own."
1,Keep looking,"this stuff is very thick and hard, I had to boil water, then put the jar in the water and hold it down in there with a heavy can. i applied it and left it on over night. washed it off in the morning dead skin did come off but came back 3 days later.Why they didn't make the product into a cream I do not know. My dermarest shampoo with salcylitic acid 3%works much better but it has sodium laural sulfate in it."
2,Very basic introduction,"This book is a very basic guide for someone who has never taken a psychology class before, giving information on library searches and how to use the internet. The two chapters on statistics were informative, though drawn out. It's a very dry read."
4,"Edna, James and Penguins","This is the third Penguin book in the ""Lives"" series I've read. Yes, they are glosses, but pretty nice ones. Who really wants to read definitive biographies? Leave that for researchers.I consider myself a literary dillitante and found this book by O'Brien a welcome spur to reread some Joyce books that had been lurking too long on my shelf."
5,Excellent,"Purchased Lollia handcreme for a Valentine's day gift. Arrived in just a few days, nicely packaged, nice box. Turned out to be a most welcome gift that was loved by the recipient. Five star experience."
1,"Toast, in less than two weeks!","Now that the mousepad is USED after only about two weeks, simply delaminated and was garbage. Not useful. Cannot buy another one like this. It is too unacceptable in terms of durability! Bad Kitty!"
5,Top album,"This album is pretty straight rock compared to the first album, but that's not a complaint. It kicks off with an absolute cracker of a track in 'Spoonfed', one if my favourite Marcy Playground songs. You'll find great riffs on this, as well as the catchy vocal melodies you'd expect from Woz.There are done social commentaries with 'Jesse Went To War', 'Death of a Cheerleader' and the tongue barely in cheek 'Flag and Finger', but this is contrasted with the supercool 'Deadly Handsome Man'.Definitely an album worth having in your collection."
5,Happy Customer,"I bought two of this garage door opener from Amazon. It arrived on type with best price and in brand new condition. I also start using it.Very happy with price, item quality and delivery speed.Happy Customer."
1,Remote control rating,"Remote control wasn't compatiable with my garage door opener. My door opener has a yellow light, and the door opener controls i got said for a purple light opener. I tried every way to get them to work, but couldn't."
5,LiftMaster Remote Control,"A fine device. It can be progarammed to operate two garage openers, if needed. Programming is a simple operation that can be done in few seconds."
2,Absolute waste of time!,"This ""cheat sheet"" is not worthy of the price that is required for purchase. Yes, the information is good, but the price is unreasonable. You can develop your own cheat sheet that will cost you only your time."
5,This is the best,"There are other chewables containing both antacid and simethicone (for gas), but the others do not have this much simethicone. Simethecone is very effective in controlling nausea. I have to take strong pain medication for a bone disease, and it nauseates me. Nothing relieves the nausea as well as this combination. The antacid is superb and the added gas reliever make a tremendous difference. I highly recommend this product for all those who need antacid and also have bloating or nausea."
2,Not all that is pictured.,"This is a review for those of you that have never bought these before.I bought one to see what the size and quality was like before I go ahead and buy and bunch of knights for a castle that I had bought my son.I opened it up and its just the horse. No knight. So, if you do the math its going to very expensive to get a whole set for a castle. As for the quality and so on. Its nice looking, not exquisite, but its nice looking. Im sure my son will enjoy it after I go purchase the knight to sit on it. But, the figure is stiff, nothing moves and I dont think the knight will be any different. You wont be able to interchange swords or shields or anything.Im going to stick with expanding the Fisher Price knights."
4,Inspirations,"It is perhaps impossible to rate a collection of short stories than span 17 years. Some ideas can only be conveyed in short format and, once a reader is prepared, he can enjoy the compact and dense environment of a one-shot game - reading a few pages that force him to to concentrate. Snip: (...)"
4,Creepy made real,"King's at the top of his game with many of the stories in this collection. The Monkey is probably my all time favorite of his works, but many stories are excellent."
4,Quintessential King,"Classic Stephen King shorts, including the novella The Mist. It was great to revisit them as an adult and I really enjoyed The Monkey, The Raft, and Survivor Type. Though, my favorite of the collection was The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet. Amazing that after all this time, these stories still manage to creep me out just as much as when I was a teenager."
1,waste of money,not what i was expecting. It is on tv and is far better than the book. I would not buy this book
4,Gaugin,"I can appreciate his artistry.I can understand why the native Polynesians came to abhor him for the way he treated the ladies,and Venereal disease he contracted from his visitation to brothels.In his madness he committed slow and painful suicide from rat poison.The native peoples were religious and superstitious.He took advantage of this.Years after his death his body was moved to a more scenic location.Again I only appreciate his artistic ability."
1,unhappy,"When I received my package, it was something totally the opposite of what I purchased. The item I received doesn't come close to the item that I purchased."
3,Don't know yet,"i just completed taking five C++for certification. I haven't really engaged, reading the book or using it. It looks interesting and promising, in that is will further my knowledge for C++."
3,"Good Toilet, but buy it elsewhere","I would recommend buying this toilet, but my shopping experience with Amazon was less than stellar.I purchased this at a price of $346, but a few days later Amazon informed me that it was damaged in shipping, so they are cancelling my order and I should go buy it again. Well, guess what? The price now had increased to $376!If you assume a genuine mistake, then it should be the responsibility of the merchant to send you another piece.If it happened at another merchant, one would suspect bait-n-switch, but since it is Amazon, I am assuming some convoluted business process snafu.Any case, I was disappointed with this experience and proceeded to buy the toilet at another online retailer at a price in between the current one and my original one."
3,Expensive for average,"On May 25, 2012 I installed a Toto Ultramax 4.8 liter flush toilet. From the first use and still to date the toilet streaks with solids. After two or three flushes it will clean itself. Over all, I would say it is no better or no worst then the Kohler Wentworth I have in the second bathroom. The Kohler comes at one third the price. Also, if you are short in stature as my wife and I the comfort height (17.5 inches high) is quite uncomfortable. This is something toilet salespeople should know and warn you about. I wish I had purchased a standard height unit (15.5 inches high I believe) Overall performance is average, just not worth the extra dollars."
2,"Terrible editing, mistake ridden, and overly simple questions.","I started going through this book and just stopped. Relative to the other qbanks available its a waste. Many questions are either unrealistically simple or overly tricky due to poor wording/editing. Many explanations are inadequate and are merely statements of fact.The book would be acceptable if it were not for the mistakes. In one chapter more than 10% of the questions had blatant mistakes or seriously misleading information. Combined with the poor wording on many questions, it makes answering some questions a pain.I guess if you need a cheap qbank or one on paper this will work, but there are FAR better resources to study from."
4,Incredibly Helpful for Intermediate to Advanced,"Incredibly Helpful for Intermediate to Advanced dancers, repeated use of this video will absolutely help with fluidity, control, etc.My only pet peeve is she is a bit awkward at first, clearly nervous, she should have recorded her movements and voice over separately.But definitely a worthwhile purchase that any level of dancer can build on (save for complete beginners perhaps)"
3,need some sort of experience first,"Don't get me wrong, I love Zoe. Tribal fusion belly dancing is very sexy. But if you want to learn it, having some sort of background in belly dancing would help. This video is very hard for someone who has never done it before"
2,"S-L-O-W, minimal character development","Not sure it was worth $2 and 90 minutes of my time. The character development was minimal and while I expected a jumpy plot because of the ""time travel"" aspect, it just didn't ""gel"" for me and despite the time travel really dragged in spots."
4,"Good Movie, bit sad","I enjoyed the movie, it was well done. Excellent performance from both main characters. I hoped for a different ending."
1,NO HAPPY ENDING !,don't fool yourself into believing that this romance movie will end on a really positive note. It doesn't. If anything it left me feeling really F---ing angry at everyone. I mean what was the dang point in the movie if they were going to end it the way they were. and why name it ONE DAY? one day you will love someone ? one day you will die ? one day you'll come across such a awful romance movie. I'm still PO'd and I know have to find a comedy to cheer me up.
1,"Boring, depressing, and without merit","I bought this movie because I've liked Anne Hathaway in past roles. I had hoped for a real romance. If this movie had a plot, a script written by a competent writer, a director who wasn't asleep at the wheel, and actors who had studied somewhere besides the local community group, it might have stood a chance. This was a shameful waste of money that leaves the audience feeling suicidal at worst and ripped off at best. I haven't seen anything this hopelessly depressing on the screen in decades. Hathaway must have been truly desperate to take this on."
4,A good love story ...,"I've wanted to see this movie for awhile and nearly rented it for $4.99 on Time Warner the other day. Thank goodness I waited. Amazon charged $.99. So, if you are on the fence - let the price sway you and then be greatful that you made the right choice. I tend to like movies such as these. Not slow, but methodical in its pace. I thought both characters played their parts well. I will be making this part of my collection. I also plan on purchasing the book, via Kindle, once I submit this."
1,used rental dvd not new,I would not buy from Stephen Elmo again the disk is marked rental not for salealso it was all marked up with a few scratches on ithardly worth the effort to return it i am sending it out of the country so it did not matter to methat there was no Jewel Case i would have taken it out of the case anyway
1,One Dud,"Take two talented and attractive actors, make them dull and ugly, and here's the result. Nothing's funny. Nothing's dramatic. The dialogue is mundane, and the only memorable scene doesn't fit. A much, much better Anne Hathaway movie is ""Love and Other Drugs,"" and no, it's not about narcotics. See that one. Skip this one."
1,One Day,"Blossoming superstar Anne Hathaway put on her sometimes iffy British accent once again for this romantic drama based on one of my favorite recent novels of the same name. The film follows friends Emma and Dexter over the course of 20 years, beginning with the day they meet and checking in on the same date every year. As the years pass, the pair naturally come to realize they may have been perfect for each other all along. Despite a solid cast, good source material to draw from, some interesting narrative elements, and the fact that director Lone Scherfig's last effort was the multiple Oscar-nominated An Education, One Day failed to resonate with me. I simply felt the film lacked the emotion, depth, and insight that made the book such a hit. This is a risky venture, possibly suitable only for the most diehard of romantics."
2,"Spoiler alert...Started out good, plodding along, then","Good happens again, then Spoiler....are you serious, the protagonist dies like that!!! Why would anyone want to see a movie this sad? I watch this crap on the news all time, I want movies to be entertaining. Sorry I thought this was a downer."
1,Ugh!,"Could this translation be any worse? Reading through this version of the Tao was like wading through chin-high mud. For a much more enjoyable read, pick up John C.H. Wu's translation."
2,***,"Olivier did NOT fall in love with Danny Kaye. This was a rumor started when Olivier mentioned that he thought Kaye was very attractive. Despite his attraction to Kaye (which never went further than attraction; they didn't even know each other), Olivier was still attracted to women. And Olivier's attraction to Kaye did NOT involve gender confusion, but rather sexuality confusion, if anything.Not a great book."
1,Still waiting,"Still waiting for a biography acknowledging what I think was her real underlying problem. Tuberculosis. Suffered from it nearly her whole life long. Aggravated it by smoking heavily, etc. TB KILLED her (in 1967??). Medications prescribed at the time could cause psychotic reactions. Add that to a highly intelligent, driven, complex personality, miscarriages, grueling work schedules, marital problems ... that doesn't up to mental illness to me. Particularly since she rarely missed any performances. Just not possible. Someday, one author won't put the cart before the horse and give this remarkable woman her due."
5,childhood memory,"This was a movie my daughter and I watched when she was a little girl, and we loved it. Now she is grown with a daughter of her own.So I bought this book for her to read to her daughter and the movie, ""Brave horses can't be broken"" for her also to share with her daughter. This was a Christmas present and it brought tears to my daughters eye's. Highly recomend both."
3,Understandable and Filled with Information Beyond Art,"A decent read for someone who was unfamiliar with Native American art. It offers culture, rituals and ways of life that are inter-meshed with the art."
4,"Thanks, it's great!",I needed this book for my 4th grade class. It came in a timely manner and we are now working on a play based on the book. Thank you!
5,Best Book for Info on Transcontinental Railroad and Coolies,"For our annual Asian-American Month celebration at school, I read this book to my 4th graders. They were very interested and learned something totally new about the US. This book really contained the best illustrations of the Coolies - beautiful pictures and wonderful story!"
4,Folding Brackets,I used these in my shed for a work bench. I have them spaced about 16 inches apart and it is a little difficult to release them at the same time. Good quality at a good price.
2,Disappointed; difficult to use,The brackets were difficult to open and to close so we decided not to use them at all. $42 wasted dollars...
4,Great product,I bought this to keep the bedrooms darker since the sun shines directly into the rooms in the mornings. Works as describes and kept our rooms darker so we could sleep in. It was difficult to apply smoothly and I couldn't get all the air bubbles out but I didn't mind the bubbles. Kind of costly for some black plastic so I only gave it 4 stars.
2,dewalt,"Unhappy with the drill. When received it appeared ""used"". Scratchs were all over it and just had a overover look of being used before. We despartly needed the drill so we kept it anyway."
3,not as good as I thought it would be,"Got these because I heard it really stays on well .... and it does to a certain extent, but not as well as it should. I do use them for yoga but also just working out. They still manage to slide off when you're in full active mode. I guess there is no MAGIC hairband out there -- I've tried just about every style there is."
3,Just OK...,"Pretty good in terms of absorbency. The band is really wide, so doesn't look great on me with my hair in a ponytail. Also, mine fell off a couple of times while doing yoga floor work. Would probably buy something more like a sweatband next time."
4,Rock on,"This band can knock it out of the park. Hard driving guitar licks that are a nice change from the technotronic music of the 80's. Get this one, it rocks."
5,Sweet Romance,"The story of Ana and Mac. She's a 14th century lady, he's a 21st century football player. Ana, desperate for her mother's release from her evil stepbrother, uses a spell to conjure a champion. Thinking she will get the great Irish Warrior Cuchulainn, she instead gets a 21st century professional football player. The two are instantly attracted to each other. Mac agrees to help her champion her mother and she agrees to train him in the ways of sword play and jousting. Together they travel to Edinburgh for the tournament. I liked this book and read it in an afternoon. I thought it was a sweet romance with a fun story. I'd recommend it!"
1,Unhappy customer,"Scale should never be sold as a hand held scale. Buttons on it are dented, light goes off so fast. This scale cost me around $70.00-$80.00 it is around a $10.00 scale at best. If you want a long lasting quality scale GOTO a jewelry supply store and buy one there."
1,"Not bad, but lacks somthing...entertainment",THIS IS THE MOST SUPER FANTASTIC ROLLERCOASTER GAME EVER!!... but if your looking for something a tad bit more interesting try staring at a rock or wall or something.
5,The Best Game!,"This game is perfect for the kid in the house or just the kid in you. The 3-d graphics will blow you away! Once you start building the ""ultra"" roller coaster a new one comes and the new ""ultra"" roller coaster will blow the other's out of the water. the game just gets harder and more fun. Can you operate an entire park? Well you 'otta try. This is a must play game! Hey don't take it from me."
3,"Good game at first, but gets old fast","I remember when Rollercoaster Tycoon first came out a while ago, and I rushed to the store and picked up my copy brimming with anticipation. And at first, it was everything I hoped it would be. You can do pretty much anything with all of the rides and shops, which was fun, but the weather effects are annoying. I completed the first five or so scenerios, and was expecting even better environments as the game went on, but I was wrong. It was more of the same-green land and trees;green land and trees. And soon after, since you have to get so far in the game to build some of the cool types of rollercoasters, you get bored with building the paks themselves, let along the scenerios. All in all, this game will last you a month, mabye two(if you play it consistantly). However, at first, the game is really fun and if you are willing to pay the money for domething that will entertain you for a little while, by all means buy it."
4,great,"i don't like the newer rct games which is why i stuck to the original. still love it as much as i did when i was a child. however, it does mess up my laptop after i take the disc out, but only temporarily so it's no big deal. great game :)"
4,The Various Features and ease of use,"This game is a good game for those who are into the Sim games such as Sim Mania, Sim Golf, etc. It has a wide variety of features to make the game more realistic. These features include a selection of various scenarios to play, researching rides and attractions, design and build your own ride, ride break downs, vandalism, litter, and financial graphs and information. One thing that I do not like about the game is the fact that you are unable to ride the rides you create like you are able to do in Sim Theme Park. This game does not take up many system resources and comes with all the required software that is needed to play. Overall, I gave Roller Coaster Tycoon four out of five stars."
3,great game /tutorial weak,"I know, What planet am I from?, but I just recently started playing RCT#1 and think it is great but I really want to master building my own rides and the challenge is to make sure your entrance and exit buildings work and gates etc. Just started excavating land and water. Water rides??? OMG Tutorial sucks and doesn't help you blueprint well enough to design coasters.The whole concept is great maybe I have to try expansion or newer versions"
2,"Slow to Get Going, Repetitive to Play","It's an inventive idea, but there's a lot of work to setting up this game (unlike some of the other Sim games) before it really gets going. The set-up time before the park was really up and running--i.e., before the game became fun, really--was just too daunting. We gave away the CD-rom to a 10-year-old (who does love it!)"
5,Roller Coaster Tycoon,"The only weird thing about this game is when a ride crashes on the water it explodes instead of sinking, but the pieces that fall off (if they land in the water) make a splash."
5,A thrilling game,"I definately give this game two thumbs up, its fun and you can play it for hours and hours. The high level of detail is what makes the game so enjoyable, you don't even have to do anything but simply watch your theme park run and you would still enjoy the game.This is a game that anyone can play and enjoy, you don't need to be an extreme gamist to enjoy Roller Coaster Tycoon. I highly reccommend it"
4,Roller Coaster Game= Great Fun!,"This game is one of the best roller coaster 'sims availible. The coaster building is a bit cunfusing and annoying at first, and the first coasters you make may be too intense, but after a while you get used to it. Some of the scenarios are too long, but great game overall."
5,The MOST ADDICTIVE GAME ever!,"Roller Coaster Tycoon's VERRRY addictive, whether it is played by a kid or by an adult. It's fun, it has cool graphics, easy goals, etc. I spent playing it once for 7 hours that I couldn't even hear my mother telling me to quit playing and eat my dinner. When I went to a friend's house, I brought this game and introduced it to my friends. They were all engrossed and couldn't concentrate on what we should have done and instead, played this game for hours. My biggest mistake was lending the CD to one of my friends and returned it to me a couple of months later.Handling this game is pretty easy, with all the building of roller coasters, stalls, etc. I have a lot of strategies in this game like, prioritizing to build an information kiosk first so that if it rains, you could raise money by increasing the prices of umbrellas. Anyway, parents should buy this game for their children 'coz it doesn't promote violence, enhances strategies & experience the fun of playing it"
5,CORKSCREW WORLD!!!,"Rollercoaster Tycoon is a really cool game because it lets you build your own rollercoaster and lets you build other rides like go carts,waterslides,and monirails. It also lets you make the prices for all the rides and the park. It also has really cool sounds. Buy this CD it's the best!!!"
3,Fun untill...,This is a fun game until you complete a park. It gets dull and boring. And one thing that makes me a little upset is that this game has one park that has a ton of rides and the other parks only have one ride already built. So thats all folks
3,"This Game is Fun, But Gets Dull Fast","Roller Coaster Tycoon is a fun game and very addictive, but only for a while.The first few weeks were a lot of fun playing this game, but after that it becomes too predictable and boring. The problem with it is that it is virtually impossible to fail at or lose. No matter what you do, within reason, and you will make money and expand your amusement park. After a while this proved boring for me and I felt like it was unchallenging and a waste of time.Another thing I did not like about the game is that the money values are unrealistic. For example, I can charge $40 to get into the park and $2 for each ride, which is all right. But I can also buy a huge multi-million dollar roller coaster for $10,000. I found this part of the game disappointing."
4,Very Addicting,"This game is very fun you get addicted. It is very realistic, people even throw up on the side walks after getting off of the roller coasters. Alotough I think that aftera while of playing this game you get very tired of it."
5,I was hooked after one game!,"I'm not really one who likes to play a lot of computer games, but when my husband brought this one home I had to give it a try. It is a blast! You can start off with ready made rides, and build your own coasters around the park. As you advance, you are given bigger and better rides and options. I was surprised at its ability to make me love it - I was hooked after the first game. I'm going to get the expansion pack soon!"
2,A great game.... with a glitch,"This game is an awesome idea. It is really fun to play. However, there is one major problem-it keeps freezing up! Just when you start to get going, boom! you have to restart your computer! I have tried everything!(updates, reloading, etc..) I have consulted a couple of my friends, and they have the same problem. If you have a compaq computer with windows '98, I do NOT reccomend this game for you."
3,One of Two Batteries Bad,"At first there were no problems using in my wireless smoke detector. In a short while, one of the two batteries I ordered was completly drained. I won't buy thePansonic version of this battery again, but maybe I just got a bad battery."
2,Huggies great -- Price not,"I only gave 2 stars because the price on this item is HIGH.I love the diapers -- good fit on my trim active boy (27 lbs) who spends most of his time running, jumping and climbing. I buy the Supremes when I find them on sale, otherwise I use the regular Huggies. I find the Huggies Supreme on sale frequently at Target, for $0.23 per diaper or LESS (I do not remember case price, I have the unit price memorized so that I know when I find a good deal)."
2,Soo Frustrated,"I want to like these but I can't get rid of them fast enough. I've been using Pampers for 2 years - and I can count the number of leak-through's on one hand. But, at 21 mths & 27 pounds, the Pampers size 4 is too small and size 5 is too big. The Huggies size 4 fits perfect!!! Like a glove..however, we have had a leak-through at least once every 3rd day and EVERY NIGHT!! Bad..might as well not even had a diaper on. Also, we haven't had any diaper rashes since 4mths..she's had one since we started using these Huggies two weeks ago. Want to like them for the fit..but the leaking is making me lose sleep at night all over again."
