1,Disappointing,I can't understand why such a talented singer would produce a CD with the caliber of songs she chose. I won't buy any more Fantasia CDs until she goes back to R&B.
3,Lacks the emotion she gave singing on Idol.,This recording lacks the sheer passion you heard when she sung live during the show. It's just ok. Glad I only spent $1.
4,CRANK IT UP!,CARRY ON WAYWARD SON REALLY SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER ON THIS ONE SO CRANK IT UP! IT WILL BLOW YOUR DOORS OFF AND MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND UP!
4,Great CD,"I bought this for my brother. He said it sounded good, but it wouldn't play on one of his CD players. He tried it on another CD player and his computer and it played just fine. Go figure. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars."
3,The Best of Kansas CD,A few good popular songs. I'm not a big Kansas follower so thought the CD was ok.
1,Songs no one should have to sit through,"Maybe I could buy this, buy the Journey Greatest hits, sit down, and once and for all determine which of these bands deserves the title of Worst Band Ever. Then again, maybe it's not worth enduring this platter of dreck, even in the name of science. If all we are is dust in the wind, don't add insult to injury by making me listen to this, too."
3,The best is decent.,"I must say, there are a number of classic rock hits on here, but none of them excite me very much. I probably wouldn't even own this if it wasn't for ""Dust In The Wind"". That song is excellent, and reminds me of some of the better stuff from ""Crosby Stills & Nash"" and ""America"". Otherwise this also has ""Carry On Wayward Son"", ""Point Of No Return"", ""Hold On"", and ""Play The Game Tonight"", all of which are good, just not the caliber of ""Dust In The Wind"". I think my problem is that some of the more rocking songs remind me of ""Styx"", and I can't stand them. Overall it's a decent bunch of tunes, but I guess I just can't be a big fan of ""Kansas"", when I'm from Missouri."
1,Too many inconsistancies,"I have bought several guides to Hawaii and I find this one the worse. Not only does it pilfer much of the information from Frommer's Hawaii, but it has so many inconsistancies you really don't know which path to follow eg. The Bus fare is shown on some pages as $1 and other $1.50, but in fact The Bus fare is now $2. This was suppose to be the 2003 version, but much of the information was out of date, speaking about the Pleasant Hula Show (formally Kodak Hula Show) which is no longer is existance. If you want to travel on a tight budget, don't look for accommodation in this book, you won't find any.Save your money and buy Lonely Planet Guides as they have more details, are more current and cater to people on different budgets."
3,Too much bla bla bla,"This book is not at all usefull, only de half of the book can be usefull to readers"
2,"Overall disappointing, but.......","I've really never liked Lil' Kim that much.....she far too often falls into the category of what I call Generic Rap-just a bunch of tiring, speedy rhymes fumbling along to a horrible backing track. But rappers who can give their songs style and infectious hooks are the ones I really admire-such as Black Eyed Peas, Eve, Missy Elliott, etc. With ""How Many Licks?,"" ""Lady Marmalade,"" and one of the tracks here might just add Lil' Kim to that list. The aforementioned track is the irresistibly hooky ""Magic Stick,"" possibly the best track Queen B has ever recorded. The lyrics are a bit stupid-as usual, just her [and 50 Cent] boasting their sexual prowess-but the chorus is infectious, and the backing track is danceable and hot. This CD is worth buying for that hit alone, but....I'd think twice."
4,Kim Is Back....,"How ironicBoth top females have a bangin first albuma horrible second albumand a banging third albumLa Bella Mafia totally blew me away, not of that poppy crap like on notiorious kimonly like 3 bad tracks- shake ya bum bum, doing it way big, and this is a warningtha beehive, thug luv, and hold it now are (some of) the highlights"
3,Good but so darn materialistic--is she even human?,"I am a big fan of Lil' Kim, and have all 3 of her albums, but the values (or lack thereof) that she propogates are astounding. I think even worse than the sex stuff, which is so over the top that it's campy, is the obsession with materialism. Does this chick even possess a soul? Probably not. Listen to the ""Jump Off,"" when she raps about her people in the ""Escalades, Benz, Bentleys,"" etc. Some of the raps are tight, the beats are hot, but come on, girl, grow up. There is more to life than material things--really. It's time for the hip-hop community, and the J-Lo's of the world, to grow up, move beyond the disgusting chains of materialism that stunt your intellect, and to evolve and enlighten itself as a community of human beings, as opposed to open-mouthed, low-class addicted consumers."
2,Garbage,"This is more typical garbage that the industry keeps producing.......anyone notice its tougher and tougher to find good rap cds,theres maybe5-6 a year now....thats LAME...everyone go buy the black album"
1,Waste of money.,"lets see here,first of all I must say that this is the only country on the planet where a 5 foot 2 ghetto chick with mediocre at best rapping skill could be rich and famous.Secondly,the only reason she has a record deal is because she was biggies friend.Ofcourse,like most rappers out today she features a million other people on the album that only proves she has no talent of her own.Her rap lirics are very boring and one dimensional as she only raps about bling bling and being a hooker.Its very sad that some people label her as the black madonna of hip hop.To finish,dont waste your money on this sleazy ghetto gold digger."
4,Good album,"This is a good album, but, in my opinion, isn't as good as ""Hardcore"" or even ""Notorious K.I.M"". My favourite tracks are ""Hold It Now"" Featuring Havoc, ""Can't F**k With Queen Bee"" Featuring Governor & Shelene Thomas with Full Force, ""Shake Ya Bum Bum"" Featuring Lil' Shanice, ""The Jump Off"" Featuring Mr. Cheeks, ""Thug Love"" Featuring Twista, ""Magic Stick"" Featuring 50 Cent, ""Get In Touch Wit' Us"" Featuring Styles P & ""Came Back For You"". This album is probably worth getting."
2,BIG dissapointment for the Queen,"I think this album is kim's worst yet!I'm a huge fan of the Queen, but save your $$. Out of all the tracks there are only 3 that I listen to, and thats only because I'm a big fan of Twista,50 Cent,and Timberland.Without them,the album would've been tossed out the window!I definitely liked her better when Biggie was writing her rhymes.And that R.Kelly song she remade!!!She did NOT need to incliude that track!I know she had to listen to that before she decided to put that on her album!... It seems to me that she is just repeating her rhymes over and over on every album.She doesn't soung original anymore... It seems she's trying to clean up her act.She realizes she doesn't need to tell the whole world whats going on between the sheets,to sell records.Eve doesn't have to, and still sells records!... I would recommend Kim's last album Notorious K.I.M. and forget about this one.I underestimated her talent.She needs BIG to get the real $$$$$$$"
2,good art.. bad stories,Sure the art was awesome! But besides the story about the origin of General Griveous (which is still too short) there's not much storyline to offer in this book.
1,Works well...for awhile,Installation is easy. Function is very good. Over the course of 3 years I've had two of these just stop working. They're expensive and not covered by warranty after the first year. Their lifespan is unacceptable.
5,An excellent reference for PowerPlant programmers.,An excellent reference for PowerPlant programmers as well as programmers that are new to PowerPlant. I wouldn't have had the motivation to learn PowerPlant without this book.
4,Digital Multimedia by Nigel Chapman,This book is very thorough and does show a diverse descriptive of multimedia. I would recommend it to any student or professional to use as a reference tool. The technical aspects of the book are very detailed and well illustrated.
3,Solitaire 500,"entertaining, plenty of games to keep one occupied for many hours, days, years.The game lacks very simple levels, and one can not optimize card size on screen, they size is predetermined and the largest is NOT large enough.I would recommend a FREE web based program like ""world of solitaire.com"""
3,More of an introduction to linguistics,"It is a good introduction to linguistics, however this book doesn't necessarily focus on syntax. It explains how languages work. What it isn't is an overview of syntax from phrase structure rules, through Xbar theory, to minimalism.Having bought the excellent Understanding Pragmatics book (in this same series) to fill in large gaps in my knowledge of that subject, I bought this book hoping to refresh my knowledge of Xbar and especially subsequent movements in syntax."
3,READ PRODUCT MANUAL BEFORE PURCHASING!,"I have two complains: 1. size - does it worth to pay $50 to sanitize only pacifiers and small items? It doesn't fit regular size bottles, breaspump details and other essential items I need to sanitize several times a day. 2. Read product manual: DO NOT PLACE WET ITEMS INSIDE - this means, I have to WASH all items first, then wait approx. 1 hour until they get dry, then another 30 minutes for sanitizing - too time consuming to me."
3,shop first,"This was just what I needed; however, I found another copy for $.25 at a local library thrift store. Oh, well."
2,The Cover Tells It All,"This opera is played by an excellent orchestra led by the excellent John Eliot Gardiner. The singing seems well-done though several of the main singers seem to sing in a style more appropriate for a later musical period with relatively pronounced vibrato. The real problem for me is Gluck's music. It is intended to be simple and unadorned as indeed the case. I find little merit or interest init. What is worse is that the stage action is very stylized and static. During an aria, it is possible that the singer will remain almost expressionless and perhaps raise his/her hand in two or three stages from waist to shoulder level. A background of stationary figues on the stage may remain almost unmoving for long periods. My wife calls this human hieroglyphics and she, justly, refuses to watch it even though the singing is quite good."
4,Nice Shoes!,The shoes are pretty nice... they are not amazingly comfortable but come close... I dont really thing there is anything better out there for the same price.
4,Neat addition to our HD collection,"Looks great on the wall. Nothing special. Just a cork board. As you know, you pay for the HD name and logo."
3,The sound?,"Great packaging, but the sound is not as good as the original recording which was tighter and more compact. On this it sounds sterile and unmoving. Bonus disc has some very good moments with the B sides and D'yer Mak'r, but too many songs where she is looking for her sound."
4,Much stronger than her next two records,"A great debut for Sheryl Crow. This album exceeds her next two efforts (although they contain fine music in their own right). The difference is probably the presence of excellent collaborators such as Kevin Gilbert and David Baerwald. One can hear their aural ""fingerprints"" all over this record, and the songs are better for it. I would like to have heard more Sheryl Crow collaborations with Kevin Gilbert; he was the real deal."
3,finger size is incorrect,"When placing the gloves on my hands the index finger is too small, I can get it on but it is tight and not quite the correct dimension."
1,truly disappointing,"There is little relevance to modern day society vis a vis the role of women. We have been emancipated far too long to pay any attention to this drivel. Perhaps Felicitas should get a life of her own and stop running home to Mommy, when life delivers lemons."
1,Bait and Switch,The picture did not represent what was sent. The picture shows 2 different styles of flanges only one was in the package.
5,Easy Five Stars,"Even among Zappa albums, nearly all of which are superb, this is a stand-out. Joe Travers plumbed the depths of the UMRK vaults for live recordings of the Petit Wazoo 10-piece band from '72. Somehow, FZ mixed and approved. Doesn't much matter how it happened, this is some beautiful music that definitely deserved to be published.Father Oblivion is not the piece from Apostrophe. It's actually a chunk of what would later become Gregary Peccary (the part where he's inventing his trend). Much of the rest is unique, semi-improvisational performances. It's all instrumentals. FZ's solos are wonderful. The band is tighter than a drum.Drummers be advised, there is an absolutely beautiful solo by Jim Gordon. Not overwhelming in terms of fancy technique, but an exercise in musicality that is nothing short of inspirational...and I thought, having been amazed by Zappa so many times, it just couldn't happen again!"
5,Very informative. Narrative from both sides of conflict. Gives good insight to events.,"I received this as a birthday present and I am enjoying reading it immensely. The book is well-written. It is very informative with good narrative from both sides of the conflict. It does a fine job of giving insight to what occurred in Stalingrad at the time of the Nazi occupation. Overall, a worthwhile read that I highly recommend without reservations. It has black and white photos."
5,Classic Jazz Album,I may not listen too jazz that much(just look at my amazon name) but i know for sure that this CD is one great album. Its completly instrumental jazz masterpiece right here. Miles Davis was a jazz genius this album is just a true classic album and is by far one of the 20 best albums ever realesed. I love this album so buy this cd today if you like any kind of music... And once you listen too the whole album you will find yourself wanting to listen too it again and again and again.You will be satisfied
4,New ...Blue (?),"I like this album very much.In '97 I purchased the 'speed corrected' version. However I'm a bit disappointed - the miltichannel version only reads 5.0 not 5.1 and the rear channels (ambient - mostly) are not that different from the stereo version, which plays surround because of othe difereence signal.if they wanted an 'accurate' multichannel version they should have stuck with a 3 channel one ,as it was recorded. The docmentary was interesting but because of the sound (5.0) it only rates 4 stars.Edd. iegolden@shaw.ca"
5,Modal Jazz Masterwork,"This is the album that took two of the most influential Jazz musicians of the last 40 years into the stratosphere of stardom.And paved the way for many others. Miles'calm,lyrical style combined with Coltranes sonic hurricanes make this an album to cherish forever.From the spellbinding opening track-So What to 2 superb takes of the Flamenco sketches.A must own for any self respecting Jazz buff."
1,Poor reproduction of a Wonderful Album: Do not buy.,I own the original Kind of Blue Album. This CD reproduction bites the big one. I got Borders bookstore to give me a full refund-A rarity. The original album is a classic.
3,This album has been overrated. .,I have a much better collection of Blues albums. This one definitely is not what it is hyped up to be. I was very disappointed when listening to it.
5,true artistic expression personified,"while my other reviews are a bit longer winded, the following encapsulates everything there is to say about this recording:KIND OF BLUE IS UNAMBIGUOUSLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MUSICAL RECORDING OF THE 20TH CENTURY. 'nuff said!"
3,"Still not convinced this is the end all, be all","So What and Freddie Freeloader, for first offs, never have grabbed my attention.I can appreciate the subtle beauty in Blue Green and All Blues, but I don't findmodal miracles here (and I admit to not really understanding the modal concepts).Davis and Coltrane are steady but not animated or creative enough here to deserve the overwhelming accolades. I'll keep giving it a chance every 5-8 years, however."
5,kind of blue,there is no greater jazz album;miles at the top of his game. i bought this as an update to my existing album. the sound is great and it is an economical alternative to the more expensive reissues.
1,BUZZ-HISS,"Maybe I got a bad copy, but the BUZZING and HISSING throughtout this CD was so bad that I couldn't listen to it. This in spite of a sticker on the jewel box proclaiming: >The finest sound ever - newly mixed & 20-BIT REMASTERED. Buy with caution?"
2,Great Box Set but Horrible Packaging!,"As others have said - This is an incredible box set, but the method of packaging the DVD and CDs is horrible. All of my CD's and the DVD are scratched and my Disc 1 won't play track 6 due to the scratches.I do hope Sony will provide replacement discs."
2,Rampant laundry of prune-like viritiousity,"After a smacking allocation of misty hornious spooky teeth like accords, the whole projects collapses in a devasted submarinistic garden of hollow and narrow blow outs. Instead of mystifiing and collapse oriented draw back it enters into the realism of a blossoming prune orchard. That the orchestra manages this garden promenade is more due to their rampant cleansing of this musically main laundry of the decade, than to Mr. Chief Prune of the century."
2,Remastered By Shroeder or some other Charlie Brown kid,"I like the album, but be wary.....whomever did the remastering should be banned from any other duties in the studio. Distortion, loud hiss, and other unexplained sounds ruin the enjoyment of the album.I recommend you stay away from the ""remastered"" version."
5,you can FEEL this album,"I gave this album to my future mother-in-law for Christmas (she lives a high-stressed life, thanks in part to me). She put it in her CD player and curled up on the couch. An hour later, I wandered in the room when the album had played through. She was so mellowed and deep in thought that she could only say ""could you press play again?""Later, fire crackling and drinks in hand, the whole family sat down for a chat and listened to it again. And again. And again. All I can say about this album is that it will really transfix you. It captures you, loses you in thought. This is what music should be - pleasant to your mind as well as your ears. I think that nearly anyone on earth could appreciate KIND OF BLUE in some capacity, and it doesn't get any better than having John Coltrane and Co. backing Miles up."
1,What's the point?,"In this inflated rating system, five stars is mediocre and undeserved by this, possibly the most magnificent recording of our century. Art blah blah blah incredible blah blah blah unparalleled... If you do not own this album, you are indescribably dull-witted and care nothing for your body and soul. Give the thing a thousand stars, and you would still be laughed at on Olympus.(I have been reading reviews online and have become embittered. Forgive me. But still, listen to this album if you have not. And listen again. And again. Which is to say, possess it.)"
1,Not very good,"This Cd isn't as good as everyones says it is, the solo's are clear and easy to hear but the group never really play together, it's no better than 'Milestones and definately less good than 'Miles Smiles'."
5,Kind of Blue,"Words cannot really do justice to this album. If it catches you just right it is all about the experience and not some intellectual definition. It's a classic for a reason and a great introduction to Miles Davis and jazz in general. Lower the lights, open a bottle of red wine and put this on, it's what jazz is all about!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Great Interplay Between These Masters,"It is a true joy to listen to Miles Davis and his cohorts blend their instruments in wonderful harmony. The color and tone that Miles, Bill, John, etc. each bring is quite refreshing and relaxing. Flamenco Sketches is especially strong in that respect as Miles emphasizes each note of his passionate solos.Whereas I do not love this CD to death at this point, I can certainly appreciate the beauty on how these masterful musicians feed off each other. And the calming tones surely do create a mood."
5,BEAUTIFUL MUSIC,I guess this is my first true jazz album. I really enjoy it. MILES DAVIS was really a JAZZ originator and master.
4,Fair price...Decent quality,I used these brackets to mount small speakers to my ceiling. The adjustments would not do what I needed when I tried fastening to the wall. You have to plan carefully where the set-screws will be when you put the speaker up to the mount. I should have gone to the store and bought a long handled hex wrench to make tightening them easier.These are worth the cost.
2,Speaker fell down,These worked ok for a few years but a speaker fell down (loudly) when bumped by a housepainter. There are better products for the price.
2,Would have rather made one with DIY parts than to buy this one..,Would have rather made one with DIY parts than to buy this one.. this is kind of cheap Chinese garbage ..America..America.. America
5,GOOD FOR SAFETY,"MY FAMILY USES THIS ON ALL OF OUR BIKES, HELMETS, MOTORCYCLES, AND OUR DOGS LEASHES. ITS AN EFFECTIVE SAFETY MEASURE AND STICKS WELL EVEN AFTER BEING IN THE RAIN OR WHATNOT."
5,A Must Read for Every Christian,"This book brings home the importance of Prayer in our lives ina very personal way.Through the Author's personal stories, he shares his experiencesand how we can apply what he has learned to our situations.I would put this book as a ""Must Read"" for all people that don'tseem to be able to find time to Pray and are unsatisfied with their""Prayer Lives"""
2,A Start for Beginners,"This book would be useful for someone who is starting a prayer group or for people who are new to (protestant) Christianity and (protestant) Christian prayer. The chapters are short and this is a quick read - good thing because people who are too busy to pray are probably too busy to read a lengthy book about prayer. Religious scholars will find this book too elementary. The language is largely simple, conversational, and accessible to a wide audience. They support their material with stories from their personal experience. It reads like a long sermon. While Hybels and Neff loosely support their material with biblical passages, they do not demonstrate how these ideas are linked to Christian tradition and liturgy."
5,Great Encouragement to Slow Down and Pray,"""Too Busy Not to Pray"" is an excellent challenge by Bill Hybels to Christians everywhere to take time out of their busy lives to commune more with the Lord who loves us enough to want to spend time with us.The book is around 150 pages and has 13 chapters with the following titles:1. The Adventure of Prayer2. God Is Willing3. God Is Able4. How to Pray Authentically5. A Pattern For Prayer6. Mountain-Moving Prayer7. The Mystery of Unanswered Prayer8. Prayer Busters9. Slowing Down to Pray10. The Importance of Listening11. How to Hear God's Leadings12. What to Do With Leadings13. Living in God's PresenceThe book is easy to read and yet contains great information and challenges for the reader to slow down and pray. Quite frankly, I have tried this several times in my own life and have found that I can get much more done in God's power than I ever could through my fleshly self-effort. It works!Read and be encouraged. Highly recommended."
3,BOB blurb (not review):,"Lavinia Reed, classically beautiful with hair the shade of moonlight and eyes the colour of violets, is uncharacteristically horrified when her husband announces that she is to take her annual holiday at Martland Farm in Cleave, for he doesn't know that Cleave, many years past, had been the settling for his wife's misbegotten romance with the perplexing Lord Francis Aubrey. Stifling these unpleasant memories, Lavinia journeys to Cleave, accompanied by her maiden sister, Caroline Prior. There, the two women are thrust into the midst of a romantic intrigue revolving around none other than the enigmatic Lord Francis Aubrey..."
3,conflicted opinion,"While Pink is an excellent writer and theologically sound I am somewhat dissappointed. I have come to find out that there are two editions, by different publishers, and I got the wrong one. I purchased the edition butchered by the publisher that is ironically named Banner of Truth. Looking at the description I click the look inside and view the table of contents. What I see online is NOT what I have purchased.Amazon needs to make these things clear:Title of the textName of the authorPublishers nameI am not excited to purchase the same book twice, so I am looking locally through family friends to find a proper copy to borrow. I have not decided what to do with this bad edition."
4,Coleman Jug 1/3 Gallon,New Coleman jug in good condition arrived about a week after order was placed. No problems with transaction.
1,"Very poor quality, reflecting the price","This may be one of cheapest digital frames out there, and it's clear why. While it theoretically has quite a few nice features, the still (jpeg) picture quality is very poor (fuzzy) and and video would not play properly at all - it was broken up, despite my using Edge's own branded media. After reading the instructions and online FAQ, to no avail, I quickly decided to return it and look for a better quality, (ie probably more expensive) unit. More trouble than it was worth, especially in terms of my time in troubleshooting. I have had another poor experience with an Edge product previously and probably will not give them another chance to waste my time!"
1,Don't get this one!,"My four year old loves scooby doo books and movies. At the book store, I let him pick the book he wanted and I purchased it without reading first. It is scooby doo, they are all the same right? It isn't real and everything ends happy. In this book, they decided it would be fun for the zombies to be real, a true mystery the gang couldn't solve. Scooby doo and shaggy actually start becoming zombies with a horrible picture associated with it! We read to my son once and immediately returned it. He got another scooby doo to add to his collection. This book should have never been written!"
3,It was pretty cool!,I liked the cd but there aren't enough well known songs by them. They should make more music videos.
1,i dont like it. they sound like little 3 year olds,i mean common! grow up a little. they sound like 3 year olds prancing around a beautiful garden. their songs are very annoying i dont like them one bit
4,good old fashioned fun!,"I don't know what perverts are out there thinking the song is about sex. Have none of you heard of the Three Little Pigs nursery rhyme? They're talking about playing house, not having sex! Get a grip! And as far as the I'll show u mine lyric, I think it refers back to the house with windows, as in people with glass houses shouldn't throw stones! As a writer, I cannot believe that so many people take a song so literally. God, loosen up, have fun! That is what music is about FUN!!! ANd that is what this album is. It's about having a good time. It's so sad that so many people in this world seem to forget how to have a good old fashioned good time. There is not always a secret dirty meaning in lyrics, and why people seem to think that more about women's groups than men's I'll never understand. Lighten up you guys and learn how to realize that some things are just for fun. As a singer from my generation once said ""Girls just wanna have fun."""
3,Take it or leave it,"My favorite song on the album is Rollercoaster. I'm not really a fan of ""pop"" music but the album is still ok."
1,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This cd is great!!! u have to buy it!!!!!!! don't listen to all the wierd people who say that B*witched are Spice Girl wannabes. I like Spice Girls and all but B*witched are much better. Take it from me!!!!!!
5,I love bewitched more than anyone in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh my God. this is the best Cd in the world.I first heard about them when all my friends were talking about this band.I'm like ""who is B*wiched?"",and they are like ""the people tht sing Cest La Vie"".Then I saw them in Consert on Disney, and I knew I had to have this Cd.I went out and bought it, and let me tell you, I have never heard a better cd in my life.I don't usually listen to the whole of it, but I DO listen to Cest La Vie,and Rev it up atleast once a day.These are my happy songs, and ITS WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!So get happy!!!!!!!!"
4,Pop with Irish flavor,"This CD is a great mix of bubblegum pop and Irish music. At times I could see playing this CD at a party, and sometimes it reminds me of Irish step dancing music. This CD has both slow ballads and high energy dance music. THe smooth vocals of the group tie everything together. I'd recommend this CD to everyone!"
3,not really 4 me,"this cd is more for kids ages 10 & under. the only song i liked was ""blame it on the weatherman"" but my little sister loves the whole cd, and all her friends like it too."
5,Works well and does the job.,Installed over 20 of these in a preschool and they do the job well. Much better than the separate plastic plugs that get lost and not always replaced by the cleaning people.
4,Good for child safety,"This item is easy to install. It is very easy to use and gives you peace of mind knowing that your child can not easily place an object into the wall outlets. Insert your plug into slots, slide plastic guard over and push the plug the rest of the way in. When pulling out plug, plastic guard is spring loaded to return over the outlet. Great Invention."
4,Excellent Novel,"This story elequently tells the story of the progression of the life of an initially eight year old child by the nickname of scout finch. This allows for the perspective of an innocent eye initially in the novel, though as time progresses and matters become more serious this outlook it easily taken aback because of the increasing maturity of the child. Harper Lee takes her time in getting to the story, though this sort of writing, which first builds a familiarity with the characters before setting the personalities they contain into conflict, allows for a more rich experience in the climax."
5,"Good Book, Deep thoughts","The book was fine, after I ordered it from Books A Million. I had ordered it from Amazon's vendor ""Warehouse Deals"", and after waiting two weeks with no books and no response to my questions to ""Warehouse Deals"" I ordered from Books A Million. On their behalf Amazon did credit my account. Still have not had a response from the seller(?)."
2,To kill a Mockingbird,"Not all that interesting but it is something that civil rights people would like to read. With the exception of the trial, the rest of it is pretty bland."
1,to kill a mockingbird bulk pack 25,"Sorry, I cant review this book, Since the seller terminated this transaction without cause or explanation and refunded my payment."
1,"Right book, wrong edition","Seller sent me a cheaper, different edition than the one listed. Was very prompt about refunding my funds, however. Book was returned, at my expense for postage."
5,A Great Book that points out injustices,"I read this book in the 6th grade and I loved it. I am now in the 8th. This book pointed out the problems that occur when you have a prejudice against someone or a group of people. I have lived in Alabama all of my life, and it is nothing like that in case you were wondering. While most kids are forced to read this book, I chose this book. It opened up my eyes to the past. I would recommend this book to everyone."
4,It dealt with all the issue's that plague mankind as a whole,I personally liked it. I agree with her profound statements of society's grave injustices and social inequality. It wasn't just about blacks or whites. It was people as a whole. Girls boys all people alike in their own special ways. This book will last a lifetime because of its universal message and appeal.
4,The truth behind Racism!,"I thought this book was very good! I would recommend this book to anyone.I like how it was honest about how whites treated black people. It shows that white people weren't fair to black people. I hope that everyone who reads this book takes in what it was like back then and can help make a change today in racism! It shows so many good, strong life lessons in it.I didn't really not like any part of it! The only thing i didn't think was right was the ending. I didn't like how Tom Robinson dies. I know that is the reality from those days, but all he wanted was to be a free man. An inistent man! Over all i love this book, and couldn't see why anyone would not want to read this book!"
4,tHe CoOl ReViEw On To KiLl A mOcKiNgBiRd,"I thought this was a really great book. I was totally exciting with alot of action. There is no wonder that it has gotten so many awards. Some things that I liked about To Kill A Mockingbird are the accents of the characters. Some things things I didn't like about it was the ending. I would definately reccommend it to anyone who is mature enough to understand the complexity of the novel. My favorite character is Scout because she is so innocent and she speaks her mind. Harper Lee brought up the subject of racism in a very unique manner. I case you don't want to read the book, you could always watch the movie which is also excellant and sticks to the plot very closely. I think that To Kill A Mockingbird deserves 4 1/2 stars, but unfortunately you can't do that on this website so I made it 4 stars! Thank-you! Bye!"
4,Inspirational,"This book is one of a kind.Harpler Lee really showed how life was like in the 30's.This book potrayed the life themes of innocence, honesty and justice."
5,Who'da thought it would be that good!,"Being a 17 year old teenager I thought that Harper Lee's epicnovel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' would be rather boring. Growing up inan era where science fiction rules every teenagers imagination, I was suprised to find that I enjoyed reading such a classic book. Harper Lee's narrator is young Scout Finch who is a fiesty, outgoing, self reliant young girl who witnesses the hate that the people of Maycomb have towards someone or something that is different from them. Witnessing the telling of the story in a childs eyes shows how innocent and not aware of prejudice children can be. Harper Lee has written a classic novel about hate, racism, class, love, and growing up. Who'da thought it would be that good!"
2,"Oh, puh-leeze","I really, REALLY hated this book. Like most people that hate it, I too was forced to read it for English class. I want to start by saying they shouldn't make us read books like this anyway. People can get the wrong idea about racism. But besides that, the whole book is being waaay overestimated. I've read books that are much better (Terry Pratchett, for example,) but they're not manadtory for reading. Down with Big Brother. Ezekiel."
2,Boring book with good ending,"This book had a great ending, but the other 300 pages justdragged on. I had to read it for school."
2,I just don't see what all the fuss is about,"I found this book to be dull, uninspiring, and not particularly well-written. I liked some of the characters, but not enough interesting things occured to keep my attention. I had to read many of the descriptive passages several times to gather their meaning, and the author lets the reader make many assumptions, which are not always correct. I've read a number of excellent classics, but I'm stumped how this could be considered one of them. I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but aside from a few isolated passages, I really didn't find this book to be very enjoyable."
4,Motive for the novel,"I believe that there are many reasons that Harper Lee wrote this book. In my opinion the main reason for the book is to inform people about a time period in America, which is often overlooked or not known about. Before I read this book I had never heard of the Scottsboro trial. I learned a lot about the trial and some of the things that took place. Another reason I why I think Lee wrote this book was to entertain. I found this book for the most part entertaining and enjoyable to read. I liked all of the foreshadowing, metaphors, and moral values."
4,To kill a mocking bird review,"This novel is a book i would reccomend to any reader interested in a valuble story filled with life lessons. The story of growing up in Maycomb county with all the raceism and mystery of Boo Radley kept me intrigued throughout the book.I give this book 4 stars, only because of the fact that the vocabulary is very advanced.This book is a great inspiration to treat people equal and you will be rewarded.!!!~**"
4,What I Think,"The book is about a killer and a man who was accused of raping a woman, The part I didn't like was where the dog was shot, and I like when that little girl who talks like an adult was wearing the ham costume, and the part when she tries to bite Boo. I recommend this book because I think that it was a good story, but if you dont want to read you should just watch the movie. The movie is the same as the book."
2,"Ohmigosh, so ridiculous...","Again, I was forced to read this, and once again I was disappointed. The only memorable part I actually enjoyed reading was the very first page, where whatsherface talks about the heat of the city. The descriptive languge there tends to suggest that the rest of the novel will be the same, but *it wasn't*. *snore* Alas, I've seen another ""great American novel"" be tossed aside..when you've actually found a decent one tell me.BTC"
5,"highschool student from hamden,CT.","I'll admit, I underrated this book. I judged it by it's cover. It looked like a yawner, but once you get to the Bo Radley part, the unwinds in interestingness. The story doesn't appear to lag on, I don't really think Dill needed to be in the story, but it was very good. The Tom Robinson case was the climax. Maturity showed from Scout and Jem, they finally realized what Atticus was trying to get across the whole time to them. The plot seemed a bit hard to comprehend, but it unraveled into maturity for the theme i'd say. Beleive me, Boo Radley wa something else, he was such a good character, it kept you intrigued to wonder about him. At the end he proved everyone wrong except Mrs. Dubose who always said he was a nice kid, he saved Jem's life, and Jem owed him one."
5,A classic,"I read this book in my 11th grade English class and enjoyed every page. It's a great story involving Atticus, Scout, and Jem as the main characters and even the complicated background of Boo Radley is very entertaining. I would recommend everyone, no matter how old you are, to read this book."
3,Missing a page,"The book was very worn out, and I was disappointed to find that a page was missing from the text. This wasn't indicated when I purchased the book."
1,"badly used book sent, I had to put it in the recycle bin and reorder from Borders",This classic was in such bad condition that I had to put it into the recycle bin and reorder from Borders.
1,To Kill A Mockingbird,"I never received this book. Today is July 20,2008. It was ordered back in June."
1,What the heck.......,"I'm sorry but the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was, in my opinion, a very boring book. I've noticed, while skimming through the reviews, a lot of people enjoyed this book. Frankly, I don't know how I could. I was bored to death reading it and the only reason I read it was because it was assigned to us in my 10th grade english class. The only interesting part in that book was when they were talking about that trial for Tom Robinson. I was disappointed in this book and it seemed so exciting but it turned out it was a bore."
5,a good read - goes well with the movie!,"I recntly relooked at the classic movie, Gregory Peck et al, and thought it would be interesting to read the book. I found it to be a gripping good story, that holds up well with a message that still speaks to us with strength and meaning even in these 21st century days. A worthwhile read. Also, the (used) book came quickly after my purchase, and was in much b etter shape than I expected. All in all, a very positive experience."
3,To Kill a Mocking Bird Review,"To Kill a Mocking Bird was higher level of reading. I would recommmend this book to high school students. The book is based on the olden days when raceism was popular in the southern states. There were some good ideas given from Harper Lee. She had an interesting plot line and gives good messages to the reader. It was very detailed, however the vocabulary was at a higher level and it wasn't always understandable. It was written a very long time ago so younger people aren't always clued in with the terms and phrases that are used. These are the reasons why I gave the book 3 stars."
4,-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-To KiLL a MoCkiNgBirD-+-+-+-+-+-+-+,"This book produces a spectacular amount of insight. The plot, in my opinion, proves to be a strong one with interesting and realistic characters that make the book even more interesting. The plot was cleverly made to not only tell a story, but to express to the readers life long lessons, that apply today and in the future. Although the book is extremely well-written, the last few chapters didn't really flow with the plot. Although exciting, I found that it was slightly out of sync. This heartfelt story will hopefully be passed down for many generations to come; so that we not only realize the moral values that we often neglect, but we learn that life is full of adventure, courage, and ups and downs."
2,Respected,"This book was very boring at first, but once I got to the fifteenth chapter, it actually started getting ok. Even though it seemed like a chore to have to read this book for english class and I definately would not put it on my ""recommended list"" I learned to respect it because of the issues it dealt with. Racism is still an evil today, but it was even more severe in the thirties. This book was written in the sixties, published in 1967, when racism was not regarded as ""horrible"" and we were on the verge of abolishing segregation, and Harper Lee wrote of these issues before many others did."
3,Historical Significance Saves This Book,"This book is slow at parts, and is boring in the beginning. However, during around the late middle it really picks up. The trial shows a fantastic mix of character development and suspense which keeps you engaged for the rest of the book. I suggest reading this book also because of its historical significance. This book gives you an idea of what was happening, and what the views were of the time.-Kyle McEvoy, 8th grade Rooptop Alternative School."
2,LadieAllure@hotmail.com,"Since I'm a 9th grader and had to read this book at school, I disliked it. I thought it was very boring and time consuming. I guess it's because I'm not old enough to appreciate the real quality and meaning of the book. Hence, I wouldn't recommend teens reading the book because there's barely any actions and the climax is basically at the last few chapters."
2,A classic but...,This book is a classic and does have a great moral and social story to tell. Its social commentary is relevant to this day. But unfortunately those facts do not save the book from wordiness and a slowly developed story line.
2,NOT ADEQUATE ENOUGH...,"This book is not very convincing, overlong, mellow, and inconsistent. The novel isn't direct towards the reader in terms of telling who it is for: adults or kids. The characters are overwhelming and the occasional flashbacks are not concrete. The novel didn't captivate myself from page #1 onto #284. Honestly, I don't see the big deal with this book or the movie with Gregory Peck. It had third rate acting and was told in a fairy tale form with the little girl as the narrator. And to just think that Peck beat out Peter O'Toole for Best Actor of 1962! Not a classic in my book by all means!"
5,So Glad I Read It,"My mother forced me to read this book, and I'm so glad she did. This book was great. The meaning of the book goes way beyond the rape trial, so I suggest that if you didn't like it, read it again! It will make more sense. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,To Kill A Mocking Bird,"While the book came within the specified time, it took longer than normal. Was hoping for a quicker delivery."
5,"The truth? OK, here it is.","Alright, I'm only going to say this once. You better be listening because I'm not going to repeat myself. I have only one thing to say about this novel and it is this. Quite simply, this is the finest, greates, the best American novel ever written. The sad truth, it is Harper Lee's only. If one person is capable of such art and beauty, you want them to write every word in their head. Alas, no. But that's it, there is no greater American novel, and I will argue with anyone who dares to prove to me otherwise. It is the classic tale of growing and learning life. Facing tragedy and coming face to face with discovery. It is about innocence lost and innocence that stolen. It is about the indominable human spirit deep within us all. IT IS THE BEST AMERICAN NOVEL EVER WRITTEN!!!"
5,Hmmm......how could I rate this book? maybe 5 STARS!,"I have read it twice and am currently reading it for my english class. Harper Lee goes into so much depth of childhood it is amazing. From the perspective of a 6 year old (in the beginning) and later as she grows up and matures. If you look closely, you can identify multiple allusions to the bible; for example, Atticus is a Christ figure. Everything he does is morally, ethically, and what-ever-else-you-could-think-of correct. I cannot claim responsibility for this finding, though. My excellent teacher brought it to my attention. Back to the point, this book is so full of morals and themes that it is mezmorizing. This could teach us all many valuable lessons. READ IT! You can thank me later."
1,"One of the worst books ever called a ""Classic""","""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was without a doubt one of the worst novels I've ever read. There's about 50 pages of good writing, and the rest is garbage. The book is riddled with strange, boring sub-plots that lead nowhere. Its just wasted time."
5,COURAGEOUS AND BEAUTIFUL,"For a book like this to have been written when it was, about and in the place it was, by a person of that timew and place, is nothing less than courageous. Harper Lee's beautiful story of redemption, love and humanity pre-cursors the works of Martin Luther King, and can be called one of the early, great influences that inspired the long-denied civil rights of African-Americans. Fantastic. As a writer, I am in awe of this kind of work, and acknowledge that I can read it, I can admire it, but I can never duplicate it.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
4,My first ever reading this book,"I see that this book hasn't been rated since 2002, man I hope someone will read this rating. I thought the book to be interesting and thoughful. Maybe I missed something in the reading but It wasn't as grand as it was hyped up to be it was just an okay book. The movie version was better."
5,Open Season on Mockingbirds?,"I like how the book talked about relationships between different races, particularly blacks and whites, as well as social classes and educational issues. The book gave good historical information about the way things used to be bacl in the day by putting the story into a real life situation in a book. Every facet of the racial factors discussed in the book produced a good moral to learn from. The author did a fantastic job of developing the characters to portray how people really acted during that time period. I would recommend this book to teenagers who want a good book to read and also for those who are doing book reports because it's a timely book with so many issues in society about diversity that also has lots of revelant information about racism."
5,A necessary read for students,"This book sends a strong message about bigotry and racial prejudice and hatred that was experienced in the south by a small family. It portrays the truth about then and sadly, even now. But not only does the book have a moral but it allows us to enjoy the childhood of Jed and Scout. Although often confusing and sometimes disturbing...I highly recommend this book...and I am a tough critic."
3,Half-Good,"This is a pretty good book. The plot isn't that bad. It would have been much better if the author had left race out of the book. I like court cases and books about them, but I don't really care too much when the moral of the story is ""don't be racist."" We've come far enough, there is very little racism out there. High school students should get to read contemporary fiction, things that apply to us now-adays, not about racism that only a small minority feel now-adays. Besides, black people are more racist than whites in this day and age."
3,"A classic, but nothing amazing","What HASN'T been said about this book? First of all, Harper Lee is a talented author, her writing is highly developed and somewhat eloquent. It's a simple book about a simple town, so there are no jaw-dropping sentences of literary prowness. Let's face it, this is not James Joyce.O.K., so the book is simple, but is it a good read? Yes. The reason it is so well-loved is because of Atticus Finch, who is a well-balanced, educated, and moral man amongst ignorant, uneducated, racist farm folk. The trial is also well written and enthralling, and the unfairness of racism is well portrayed.One of the greatest books of the twentieth century? Not even close. One of the most well-loved? Definitely. Few hate it, but for those who dive deep into literature: it doesn't live up to the hype."
1,Boring,"Picked up this book from the library due to the reviews, plus heard from the coversation between 2 colleagues that it is a page-turner.However, it is to my disappointment from page 1 till page 40. I could not drag myself to wade through page 40. It seems like a book with no clear objective to convey, it might have one, it failed to grap my attention. The first 40 pages talked about childhood memories of 3 kids, again without even any indication to the main story of whatsoever.It might be the greatest literature book as it claimed, it is just not my kind of book."
1,i hate this book!,"there are a lot of great books out there but i just hate this book .. when you start reading the novel it becomes really boring not to mention how long it is. I would recommend ""the catcher in the rye"""
2,The Mockingbird as Predator,"The title. To put a mockingbird or any other singing bird above all others is counter-intuitive. All living beings have the same value, all life is inherently unique. The author posits that the mockingbird does no harm, but the insects it eats would say otherwise. The mockingbird is just as base, just as feral as a tiger.The novel. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is certainly a regional tale and yet it is entirely transposed and made unique. The fundamental flaw of the work is patriarch, Atticus Finch. Behold the savior of the down trodden race, raise him high and everlasting, let his name be known across the dark land.The land is dark because Atticus overshadows it, his skills as a lawyer of more import than the man he defends. His family, friends and town are props conspicuously used to frame the towering moral height of the man. Summed up: ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is an exaggerated Norman Rockwell painting.Chris Roberts, Killer of Mockingbirds."
1,OVERRATED DUD,"Like many people, I read this piece of crap in junior high school. Yet unlike many people, I read this out of free will. I was actually interested in it. I think it was three months later (Yes, it is that slow) when I finally finished it, very dissappointed, angry, and praising English Literature, while denouncing American Literature (Except Trancendentalists, Lost and Beat Generation)IF YOU WANT TO READ A CLASSIC, PASS THIS ONE BY AND READ CHARLES DICKENS, GEOFFREY CHAUCER, THOMAS HARDY, THE GREAT JONATHAN SWIFT OR ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON!ANYTHING BUT THIS OVERRATED PIECE OF CRAP!THE ONLY REASON THIS IS STILL FORCED UPON PEOPLE ONLY TO BE DISSAPPOINTED, IS BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE 1962 FILM ADAPTATION."
4,"A nice book, but with poor closure.","This book is a timeless classic. It shows how brutal people can be given their surroundings. When three children experience the depths of prejudice, they realize how cruel and closed minded people can be. A great read.The reason I didn't give this book a fifth star was because of the poor ending. It was too ... unreal and the final pages didn't show the depths of the story and didn't give a very nice closure. I could predict the last chapter from the very beginning.Overall, pretty good. Lots of symbolism and depth."
5,A Killer Classic Of All Time,"I was born in 1976 and found out all of a sudden that some of the movies I like are movies that were viewed by my father who was born in 1945. That is close to 30 years difference. But I thought I would try classic movies and picked the good old classic To Kill A Mocking Bird for my first one and was more then overly satisfied with my choice. Which is why teachers have students read the novel in school, Because it teaches you a good lesson for growing up. And the classics were great for teaching you all about love, and all about life's rights and wrongs. And To Kill A Mockingbird is a great movie to watch for all ages to learn, enjoy, and entertain. I would recommend it to bye including all types of movies."
4,Review,"The siblings Jean Louise, called Scout, and Jem Finch grow up in the south states of America during the 30`s in a society with blacks and poor families. In the small town Maycomb where they live, blacks are made scapegoats for everything going wrong there. When their father Atticus , a lawyer, has to defend the black man Tom Robinson, who should have raped a white farmer`s girl Jem and Scout are confronted with hate and prejudices of many white people in Maycomb. During their father`s case they become older and they begin to understand a lot of things. Jem and Scout learn many things and behaviours from their father but the most important thing they learn is that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.The book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" shows racism in the southern states of America. Through Scout`s eyes and her point of view the reader gets to know how the society was during the 30`s. This book is really worth reading."
3,Don't like the book on CD,"I have read the book before and love it! I don't really like the CD version though. The reader's fake southern accent makes it very hard to understand. I don't know why they didn't use a southerner to do the reading. When the reader pronounced ""pecan""""pee can"" rather that the ""pa cahn"" it made everything else less believable . I had to relisten to the first CD three times to get it. It's a ""duh"" thing but when a book is written about the south use ""real"" southerners for the audio book."
4,Accurate depiction,To kill a Mockingbird is a well written story addressing racism and morality in the Deep South. The author takes a unique approach by telling the through the eyes of Scout as she understands her environment. Lee develops the theme of the struggle between morality and the social values of the south before the Civil Rights Movement.
5,A Timeless Story of Overcoming Hatred,"The 1930's were a turbulent time for the South. Racism was commonplace. This was the way of life in Maycomb County, home of Atticus, Jem and Scout Finch.Scout was Jem's younger sister. Thier father, Atticus, was a laywer. The Finch's neighbor is of great interst to the kids. It is the home of the elusive Boo Radley.Dill, a friend of the Finch's visits every summer. He encouages them to try to draw Boo out. They come up with many plans to the this accomplished, but none work.Atticus is appointed to represent a black man, Tom Robinson, in a rape case. Tom is unjustly convicted and shot while trying to escape prison. Later, after a Thanksgiving pageant, Scout and Jem are attacked. The attacker was killed by an unknown person helping the kids. Who were these two people you ask? Read the book and find out."
1,Not a Good Tutorial,"I kept hoping that they would get to the point and give me some instructions, but I still don't know how to kill a mockingbird. Had to resort to an eHow article that finally worked."
2,To Kill a Mockingbird,The copy I received was filled with hand written notes throughout the text. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
5,Great book!! It's very moving and I recomend it to anyone.,"This book was so good that When I finally got my 13yr.old- anti-book -sister to read it she couldn't put it down. This moving novel about a brother and sister who learn valuble life lessons by watcing thier wise, lawyer/ father go against the grain as he defends a negro on a rape charge to a white women. They learn to control thier anger aginst most of the town who opposes thier fathers decision and learn more out of the whole trial than they'll ever know."
2,Extremely boring!,This was an extremely boring book (contrary to most opinions) that had an extremely slow start.
3,David Cardimen wrote this!!!,"I really thought this book was ok. Some of the parts from the book are really boring and some of the parts are really creative and interesting. The book tells a great deal about understanding and looking at someone or something by another persons point of view. The Book is basically about Jem, Scout, and Atticus. They all learn how to love and how to understand each other. I think the book is sad and dreadful at times. They treat the man that is different like a piece of trash on the street. The book talks a great deal about racism, and understanding. It also Takes a great deal of courage to do some of the things that atticus did, like support a black man in court. I think this book is interesting and somewhat worth reading!!!"
3,The Book My Teacher Likes,"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. It is a reallistic fiction book. it is loved by many and has won losts of awards, and is an instant classic. the book takes place in the 1930's so it focusess on racism, discrimanation, and things like that. harper lee has not wrote any other books, witch is suprising because everyone loves TKAM so much. this book goes through the life of scout finch, a younge girl living in a small town in alabama. she deals with the strees of life as a lawyers daughter. on top of that her father""atticus finch"" is taking the case of a black man acused of raping a white woman. at the time, rape was a Capital offence in alabama. in my oppinion it was an ok book. it has a very strong plot that has caused the book to be band in many places. I think Harper Lee didi a good job of discussing the issues and conditions from back in the '30s. I would only reccomend this book to people who like a lot of drama!"
4,accurate recreation & translation of a difficult manuscript,"Peter-Arnold Mumm,Universitaet Muenchen, in the Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies 9, 1999:169 says ""The edition is carefully carried out and instructively designed."""
5,Accept No Imitations,"This is an excellent book. I read ""In His Steps"" long before it became popular. That is an excellent book. There are some similarities, but ""Imitation of Christ"" covers more ground in a lot less time. The chapters are all short and most can be read in a minute or so (great for bathroom reading or short devotionals during lunch). It is clear that the author has a great deal of practical experience, much of which shows through."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know; but...,"Indispensable! As a novice to the field of Landscape architecture/ design; this books proves to be the most valuable source I have found in explaining techniques that are often overlooked in the studio instructions at universities. Step-by-step guides, no subject is neglect as self evident or insignificant; - a must read."
5,what's the fuss?,"reviews on this product are overblown. you would think people were buying a space ship. this product is made to be simple and function as expected. you take the fry daddy, fill with oil to the line, heat oil for 10 minutes and add your food. fry daddy will do fries in less than 5 minutes - or for real crunch - a little longer. let frier cool and cap and store away. it holds a lot of food for a small frier. who cares if this thing has not temp control or an idiot light to let you know it's working. believe me, it works and works well. try frying fresh vegatables or, make your own batter and give them crunch. if you are single or a couple this fryer will work for you in spades."
2,functional but...,"...I still recommend a fryer with adjustable settings to avoid overcooking, a wire basket that is convenient. Other products with lower price has the above additonal features."
1,Extremely Dangerous,"I purchased this product a little while ago. When it broke, it broke in the most dangerous way imaginable. Suddenly the thermostat stopped cutting off the heating element. The oil (fresh vegetable oil) continued to heat (well beyond the smoking point) and ended up popping and exploding all over my kitchen. The room was so dangerous to enter that I had to cut off the circuit breaker to my entire kitchen in order to stop the nightmare. Presto's only solution was for ME to pay the shipping to send the product back to them and they may or may not be able to help me. Are you kidding me?!? They're lucky I was 15 feet away at the time and didn't get injured or they'd have a lawsuit on their hands. Please beware of the dangers associated with this product. Consider buying one with a lid or splatter screen instead."
3,"Nice Little Fryer, Wish It Heated Higher.","I like this unit because it is small and can be stored out of the way when not in use. When in use, it doesn't take up much space on the counter. Watch out, though, as the exterior gets very hot - this is not a ""cool touch"" fryer. I would give this 4 stars if it heated up past 350 degrees. I used a candy thermometer and the max temperature is 350, which is just enough for frying foods.Use small batches because if you load it up with food, the temp of your oil will drop, which will cause you to have to wait a while between batches for the oil to heat up again.5 stars for small compact design and that it doesn't take too much oil - just 4 cups of oil or shortening.3 stars for only average heat. I could use 25-50 degrees more heat to keep up the cooking temperature when I put in cold items like fried calimari or potatos."
1,taste like burning,This thing need a thermostat and a knob to control the temperature. Everything I throw in there from fried chicken to tempura turns into a dark brown/ black color.Please look elsewhere for a fryer I'm stuck with mine.
2,scorched the food,"Since there is no temperature adjustment the oil got too hot and scorched the batter while leaving the food undercooked. There is also no power button so when you unplug it from the wall it sparks. Took it back. It was easy to clean, though."
1,I guess the post office SAID they couldn't deliver.,We had a series of light snows. I guess the post office couldn't get their feet wet. They sent it back as undeliverable. Thanks Mr. Postal.
5,Good replacement for my old fryer,"It was the price of this little fryer that really attracted me. However, I have to say after using it for nearly 6 months now, its quicker to heat up and uses a lot less oil than our old fryer."
5,Presto FryDaddy Deep Fryer,"I have tried several electric fryers in the past. This one is the best. The oil heats quickly and food fries efficiently. Because of the design it holds approx 3-4 cups of oil. Good for small to medium jobs. No real complaints with this item. The price point is very affordable.Easy to clean, store and use again and again."
5,Done Deal!,I bought this sweet little unit for my wife to replace one we had used literally to death. She loves it and uses it with a smile - which makes me smile!
5,Presto fry Daddy,I like this Presto Fry daddy as the oil gets hot quickly you do not have to regulate the temperature at all. I had one for many years and decided to buy another fry Daddy as i use this a lot of times.
4,excellent product,"3 years have past since i bought this item ans is still working excelent. it's small and practical, maybe not for industrial uses, just home use, but very usefull.the only thing I see that makes it 4 star and not 5 star, is that it would be better if it had temperature selector.another thing that would be better but its not a must have, its a glass cover, because the I forgot to take it the rubber cover off and it melted. but it's just a suggestion that does not interfere with the product's function.in general excellent product"
3,Plastic + Oil = Bad,"It works great, got one from Walmart. The only problem is the fact that they ship it with a plastic utensil *facepalm*. Is this some kind of stupid joke? Sticking plastic into oil at a temperature of ~400*F is not my idea of safe cooking. I bought this to get coronary artery disease, not cancer from eating melted plastic seasoned foods. I think I'm going to bug them to ship me the metal spatula for free."
1,Raid Ant Bait,"Ants still here in Maine, where it is Darn Cold Too ! The ants turn their nose up at the bait and walk right on by to something else on the floor. I have been watching them, it is a joke. They stream in and stream out of the cracks in my dishwasher 24/7, morning til night and have an afternoon nap. I was hoping some took a swim while they were at the dish washer. It has been days now, I figured maybe I need to wait a few days before the nest wherever got peppered with poison, and still no success. You know I thought the bait looked like Peanut Butter Too? I'm so mean won't give them a good time with the jam or jelly. I'm so disgusted. Those fire ants, medium ones do sting awful, had a few bite me on my belly ;-(Think I have one up my pant leg now. If not I'm getting some paranoid. I think we should buy only the spray from now on."
1,Useless avoid!! Waste of Money!!!,"Completely useless, waste of money, I tried it on 2 different kinds of ants, the larger slow moving ants and thesmaller fast moving ants with bigger antennas.They went around it, not a single one went inside, in fact they smelled something offensive, and made sure NOT to wanderinside by accident.Complete rip-off and a waste of money!!I sprayed the ants with ""Bugout"" flying insect killer and they died instantly..."
4,"Not as good as OUT OF SIGHT, but few movies are.","This is a brilliantly realized film. Anyone confused by the flashback structure used to GREAT effect here should go watch 'Armageddon' again or something. By showing us how Wilson has changed so little since his daughter was a young girl, Soderbergh really adds a deep sense of poignancy....the footage from Stamp's earlier film blends in very nice. And Luiz Guzman rules! He has some wonderful moments here that I hope other directors/casting agents will notice. Challenge yourself with this movie!"
2,Low-key revenge thriller,"""The Limey"", directed bu Steven Soderberg, and featuring Terence Stamp in the title role of the Cockney gangster out for blood in L.A., is a revenge drama in a minor key. Stamp, whose dubious accent elicits the occasional snigger, plays a veteran London crook who arrives in America to avenge the mysterious death of his only daughter, which, he believes, occured at the hands of a wealthy entrepreneur. The plot is strictly production-line, with the odd ironic twist and risibly melodramatic performances. What partially redeems the film is the pace and skill of Soderberg's direction: each scene never exceeds the limit of a few minutes, thus giving the film the quality of abstraction. Overall, though, 2 and 1/2 stars."
2,This movie was horrible.,"Gee, let's see the same flashback scene 20 times! It is nice to see that Peter Fonda's acting is as bad as ever. The last scenes were OK, but the build up was an hour of tedium."
2,"SLOW PACED, AND WHAT IS THE POINT?","One could be forgiven for expecting great things of this movie. After all with Steven Soderbergh directing, the man behind OUT OF SIGHT, ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, you immediately imagine you are going to be watching another masterpiece from this hugely talented film maker. Sadly, THE LIMEY is a huge disappointment. Terence Stamp is excellent,and being a sucker for revenge movies I thought this would blow me away, but the film moves at such a sluggish pace and there seems to be no point to it. If you want a good revenge movie check out POINT BLANK. Vincent Price's THEATER OF BLOOD is another good one, though in a completely different genre. But avoid THE LIMEY..."
4,"Great, Gritty Film","It is alot like ""Get Carter"", the protagonist is seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. It is a very dark film filled with excellent performances. Once I started watching it, I could'nt tear myself away until the very end."
1,The Worst Acting - The Worst Directing - The Worst Movie,"Alright I am going to make this very quick. This movie is absolutly horrible. I normally dont take the time to write the reviews, but I had to let someone know. Although the actors and directors are both good they do not pull it off at all. The script is riduculus and the plot is a joke. Whatever you do never ever ever even think about this movie. I feel like the buck I spent renting it was the biggest waste of money ever. I would have had a much better time throwing the money in the trash. Oh yea the ending of this film horrible. Okay well there is one way someone could justify buying this movie - If they needed something to burn to keep warm at night. Actually as much as this movie bites I dont even think that would work! If anyone agrees please write and say so. Movies like this should not be on the self - they should be in the trash.P.S. - Peter Fonda stains his Easy Rider legacy with this film"
1,Terrible experience,"This product will not install on Mac OSX version 10.6.x. This is the response from IMSI:""TurboCAD Mac v1.1 has not been tested or is supported on the operating system Leopard 10.6.x. The newly release version of TurboCAD Mac v5 is Snow Leopard compatible, for upgrade pricing please contact our sales department at [...]So, this brand-new software is not usable for me, and IMSI wants me to buy an upgrade. The product page only says ""Macintosh OS X (10.2) or greater"". I hope Amazon will take this back, but either way it's a lot of wasted time and effort, and I still don't have the drawing software I need."
4,Satisfied!,"The product was shipped in a timely manner, as I requested (2-day shipping), brand new, and it was exactly what I needed for my class."
3,"Ed Palermo is not ""Big Ed""","I purchased this CD from Amazon thinking I was getting a new release from ""Ed Palermo and His Big Band"". I have had the pleasure of seeing Palermo & band in NYC several times. Thier covers of Frank Zappa's big band numbers are beyond reproach. When I got this CD in my mailbox, something was, shall we say, WRONG. ""Big Ed and Special Forces"" is not, as Amazon described, Ed Palermo. Unless Mr.Palermo put down his saxaphone, and is now a large Afro-American belting rap tunes such as ""F'ckfest"" or ""Head Busta"",(I am not making this up) Amazon has made a pretty big mistake. With so many new releases, mistakes will happen. But to confuse big band jazz with rap sure does make me wish for a good ol' fashion' record store.As for fans of BigEd & Special Forces, I rated this 3 stars just to be fair. (They MADE me rate it something)"
1,Don't buy this book,It is out of date. Non informative and a waste of money. If you have done a little research you already know more than the author on what the military offers and the things covered in this book.
4,Blow Me Away!,"We were already on our way to an impromptu wknd @ the beach and I had to stop @ the library for a few novels.. I don't know why I chose this one. The book jacket synopsis really drew me in I guess.This is a very awesome novel, loved the characters and remained unabashedly concerned with what would happen to them! The author's descriptive narrative of the New England coastline was mesmerising as was the story itself.I am definitely going to read it again."
5,Great Mouse,I bought this in 2006 when it was new and top of the line. I used it daily and constantly. Being able to swap batteries in the middle of a game was great. The application allows for speed and sensitivity settings which help depending on the game played.It lasted until earlier this year when it just went on the fritz. I think 2-3yrs is good for a mouse.
4,Excellent Wireless Solution,"I was replacing a wired G5 mouse when I purchased this one. The ergonomics of the mouse are excellent; it really feels comfortable in your hand (sorry lefties.) Further, they include two batteries so you never have to 'dock' the mouse...you can just swap out the batteries when it stops responding. I also like the ability to change the tracking speed on the fly. All in all, I would repurchase this mouse and recommend it to anyone looking for a wireless solution. (Tracks as well as any corded mouse I've ever had!)"
5,Sweet Mouse,"I got it last night and have loved it since I opened the package! It worked right out of the box, no installation necessary on both my work (Windows 2000) and home computer (Windows XP). It has worked on every surface I have tried too. It even worked on my clear glass coffee table at home (although it skipped a little bit). I bought it for use with Battlefield 2 for the PC and am very happy with the purchase. Its pimp too!The charge on the batteries out of the box lasted about 4 hours but when I put a fully charged one in. I played games with it for 4 more hours and have used it for 3 hours at work and it still shows the battery at 80%!Love it!"
1,freezes constantly,recieved a new one with same problem. tech support said its a common issue with this model. pretty useless.
3,"Close, but no cigar.","Very good responsiveness. Good right/left buttons tactile response.Mediocre scrolling wheel quality. Very poor battery life. Right/left buttons get worn out within a half year, will need replacement (poor quality micro switches).Not recommended."
4,Mousing around with a G7,Wow! This G7 is really accurate and responsive. It makes using the first generation wireless mouse akin to driving a Beatle compared to one's Lexus. I do agree with other reviews that the rechargable battery life is REALLY short and so surprising for such a fine product otherwise. I am also surprised that one cannot find a G7 on the shelves in the major stores. Do they know something I don't?
4,G7 Laser Mouse Review,"I bought this wireless mouse a few months ago and the only complaint I've got is if you have a WiFi in your house DO NOT GET! Wireless connection interferes with the signal from the mouse.Other than that, it's most impressive. No lag, and perfect for fps games.The battery life is short, so be sure not to take off to a lan party without both batteries and the charge station.Overall. Well worth the buy."
3,"Nice Mouse, Good Idea, but","Well, I am a serious gamer. I bought this mouse for all the options it offers. It has great abilities, however, I noticed my mouse would skip across the screen. I tried changing the DPI, bought two different laser pads, cleaned surfaces, everything to no evail. Finally I sent this back to Amazon (great return ability!!) and bought the wired G5. I have not been disappointed going back to the wired G5.Could have been just the mouse, but I did not want to take another chance on another wireless mouse. Made gaming accuracy go down, as well as irritating when trying to cruise the internet due to the mouse skip..."
2,Lazer went out in 3 weeks,The lazer went out within three weeks after purchasing the G7 but Logitech stood behind it and sent a G700 which is a much better wireless mouse as a replacement. WOOT! for Logitech and their customer support. I'm still a Logitech customer and fan.
2,"Great mouse, when it works.","I was really excited to get this mouse after reading some of the reviews. For the first couple of weeks it worked great...now all of a sudden the mouse stops working at random...sometimes upwards of 5-10 seconds.I have my mouse about 4ft from my wireless router, and only about 5 inches from the charging station...so any interference should be very minimal and I don't think that is the problem.Quite a few other people have had this problem as well(check the forums on the Logitech website)...and some have had to send back their mouse 3 TIMES before they got one that actually worked properly. If you are using this mouse for a lot of gaming like myself...get ready from some potential aggravation.This really seems to be a hardware issue that is still yet to be addressed. If I could do it all over again, I would get a different mouse, from a different company."
2,A Dictionary Should Not be Biased!!!,"The hallmark of a good dictionary is fairness to all schools of economics, but the editor, Robert Beynon, lives up to his profession of ""yellow"" journalism. Imagine a dictionary on ""globalization""--the end of communist command economies, global free markets and entrepreneurship, the dynamic financial markets, currency crises, etc.--and the editor has NO entries for Milton Friedman and the Chicago school!!! The Routledge dictionary has separate entries on Keynes, Marx, Solow, Galbraith, Malthus, Marshall, Mill, Say, Smith, Pigou, Schumpeter, Hicks, Modigliani, and Ricardo, but no entries on Friedman, Stigler, Fisher, Mises or Hayek. The latter two deserve special mention because they were the principal economists to predict globalization and the collapse of Soviet central planning! The book doesn't even have an entry on Paul A. Samuelson. Go figure."
3,Maclean goes inside for the last time,"Most interesting are Maclean's observations from trips in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Georgia. Supporting his perceptions is an overall history of Russia and the Soviet Union plus brief regional histories. Very valuable are Maclean's personal notes on the changes during his 50 years traveling in the country. The book's concluding chapter delves into the USSR of 1987; how people actually live, differences in society, and the economic system smoothly moving towards western capitalism. Unfortunately, many run-on and flowery sentences in the early chapters do detract from the content."
5,This is a great CD,"My 4 year old daughter and I LOVE this CD!!! The double cd is great, she got one and I got one :)"
5,UP! is a breath of fresh air,"Shania has ""gone and done it again"". Fantastic range of varying contrast in her song writting. Vocally she has never sound better. In short, UP! is fun, romantic and the whole family can listen without being offended."
5,Shania Rocks this country,Upon purchasing this c.d I was very curious as to whether I would like the c.d. After recieving it for Christmas and listening to it I was very impressed. I think that all of the songs on the c.d are great and I especially love the fact that she has included 2 c.d's with different beats to the songs on each c.d. Way to go girl! You certainly made a great comeback and you still rock this country!
1,Disappointing,"I am normally a big Shania fan but this album has been tough for me to get through, even when I try time and time again. Her voice seems very strained and unbelievably, sometimes is irriating to listen to. I was also disappointed with the quality of the songs - you can only rhyme words like kiss/miss, together/forever so many times and in so many songs. ""Forever and Always"" is a keeper. The others are passable at best, and I think the album would have flopped had it been a debut, instead of her 4th CD. I will give her credit for the issues and song topics, it's just the melodic qualities were very... overdone. Definitely a disappointing album, I feel like I wasted my money."
1,"Wow, the same songs twice over!","If your not yet tired of ms twain, get this cd. Not only do you get the songs in the twangy crap that is country music, but, you also get a pop version of the exact same songs. Where is the creativity?"
4,Shania is great,"This will probably be the one and only country CD I buy this year. Women empowerment, warm hearted love song, and an occassional broken heart are the themes of this album. At the time I am writing this, Shania will be number one for the second week on the Billboard charts. My favorite song on the CD is ""Waiter, Bring Me Water"" but with songs like ""Juanita"", ""Forever and For Always"" and other songs, people will be very pleased with this album."
1,This CD Sux!!!!!!!!!!!,"What has happened to Shania Twain? Her past works were soooooooo good and this one is so awful!I tried the old keep listening it will grow on you approach;it didn't! It merely got on my nerves even more!The Cd is way over-produced the vocals grating and the music blaring.I listened with dismay as I realised the real Shania was gone and now she was a mindless Mutt Lange fabrication.Take my advice and don't spend your hard earned money on this partially worthless piece of crap. I've already sold my copy!For something tender,something real, something pure buy Sherrie Austin Streets Of Heaven instead!!!!!!!!!!"
1,She should have quit while she was ahead,"First of all, if you want true country music look elsewhere. The only reason I could see for Shania to release these CD's is for money making purposes because she has obviously already recorded her best material. Songs like ""From This Moment On"" are not about to be topped. As far as her other ""catchy little tunes"" from her other albums, they have just been rehashed on this album and it has become tiresome! She hasn't evolved one bit! I do find her lyrics a little hypocrital too when she relys so HEAVILY on her appearance to sell her cd's and concert tickets."
3,Down!,"maybe I was expecting too much of this album, therefore i'm disappointed, my fav. is 'i'm gonna getcha good'"
2,Up! Falls Short,"After waiting five years for this album, my spirits were anything but ""up"" when I finally heard it. Expecting Shania to top ""Come on Over"" would be expecting the impossible, but her longtime fans deserve better than this teenpop-rock hybrid. The album lacks variety, lyrically and instrumentally. After the first two songs, which happen to be the only songs on the cd that I liked, the whole thing starts to sound the same. The lyrics are immature and at times, outright stupid.Her voice is still as lovely as ever, but it isn't enough to save this album. Sorry Shania, Up! is definately two thumbs down."
3,What happened???,"OK, it was obvious that Shania`s Come on over was unsurpassable, but she could have done MUCH better; this new CD Up! is really disappointing. 5 years waiting for THIS, come on! I mean it is not a bad CD, but from Shania I expected it to be a GREAT one. I really don`t know what happened to her..."
2,Not Country,"I don't think Shania Twain should really even be considered a country artist anymore. With the exeception of one or two songs, I was VERY disappointed with this CD. Even the country CD isn't really country."
4,Didn't think I'd like this album,"But I did...Talk about getting your money's worth, though...you get 2 mixes of each song & each CD has over 73 minutes worth of music. There are a lot of good songs on here, too. This album is worth it."
1,one star for being catchy...,"but catchy only because the same synthesized drum hooks are used in every song - i will give her kudos for including pop and country takes on each song, but what good does that really do? they all still sound the exact same! what happened to the pop/country tinged catchiness of *come on over*? for my money that is the better cd when discussing pop cross-over ability.i did miss shania - i think she puts out fun music - but this CD is a disappointment -"
4,The CD is hip-hop,"This a fun upbeat CD. It is great to drive around with your gal-pals and sing at the top of your voice. However it is not country do let the placing in the catagory of country fool you. This cd ranks in there with Brittney and Cristina. A good CD and well worth the money. It contains two CDS, they are the exact same CD so you can give one to your friend."
1,This CD is horrible!,I bought this CD because I am a Shania Twain fan. I was very disapointed with it. It was the worst of all her CD's so far. I thought it was horrible and lacked creativity. It was very boring too. The only good songs on it are I'm Gonna Getcha Good and It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing.
2,give and take,"Isn't she fine, still... But denifinetly not her best work. Most tracks sound similar to previously released material.She is the finest woman in country music (Faith Hill #2) but her new music is out of the top 10 in my book."
1,Very Disappointed,"The lyrics are hokie. The quality of this CD is ""slapped together."" It's as if NO effort was put in to the lyrics, etc. Waste of money!"
2,Going Down Hill.,"Shania is on a downward slope. The two version of the CD packaged together are a good deal, but I wish the matial was stronger."
3,Sounds like a Bollywood album,"I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned how much the country version sounds like a typical Indian film music album. And its no wonder - the whole country disc was recorded in Mumbai and all the musicians on it are Indians. Its definitely a newer sound to a western ear but its nothing new to those who've listened to Bollywood, in fact some of the songs are just straight rip-offs from A.R.Rehman. I'm not saying its bad - I just think the pop version is much better. The country version I expected was the kind we see in ""Any man of mine"" etc - not ""eastern"" country."
1,.......,"What exactly is it that makes people like Shania Twain? Is it the anti-male lyrics('That Don't Impress Me Much'), the double standards ('Any Man of Mine') or the hypocrisy ('What a Way To Wanna Be')? I have listened to Shania's ""music"" since 1997(because her producer husband has enough money to get her gobs of radio airplay), and I have craved insulin shots ever since then. Well, Rolling Stone's cover had the heading 'Shania Knows What You Want', but it should have been titled: ""Shania's Producer Husband Knows What You Want"". 'Up' is basically a collection of nonsensical pop drivel."
4,"Good Value, Great Price","These boots are comfortable from the very beginning. The leather is soft, supple and water resistannt, yet thick enough to provide adequate support. Fit is true to size and the black rubber sole blends perfectly with the black leather. The insole is removable, but not very substantial. At least it can be easily removed and replaced with a better insole. I would have liked to have seen speed-lace grommets for easier on/off capability and maybe a greater number lace pattern than the four this shoe provides. Other than that, it's a great shoe for the money, and I have yet to lose an inch square chunk from my sole, as the previous rater experienced."
2,C'mon C'mon,"The title says it all. A lousy album. Sheryl Crow is a poor songwriter and even a worse singer. She has no deph, no originality and her vocal range is bad. The songs on this album are so american ( No offense). A Duet with Don Henley and then bacups by Tom Petty and that god awful Stevie Nicks ( except for the rumors material). Sheryl Crow is just so uninteresting in my humble opnion and so is her music."
3,Not a stellar effort,"I happen to be a huge fan of Sheryl Crow, but admittedly, this disk is a disappointment. There are a few gems (namely ""Soak up the Sun""; ""Steve McQueen"") but overall, the tunes are forgettable. ""You're an Original"" is particularly irkesome; it sounds like it was specifically penned as a jingle. In fact, hasn't it already been featured in some automobile ad? This is easily the weakest of her four studio CDs; odd, considering she has done more co-writing on this one, save her debut. However, Ms. Crow is a talent to be reckoned with. I have no doubt her next studio effort will exceed even my lofty expectations of her."
5,Getting better all the time,"Whatever Sheryl has been doing to stay in tune and grow more creative- it's been working - as displayed in this new collection. This record will satisfy all your rock taste buds, or music buds for that matter, with several rock and roll tracks (Steve McQueen-, You're An Original) which have the unique Sheryl Crow trademark sound yet will fondly remind you of some classic tunes of 70's rock. The kids will definitely enjoy the more pop - Soak up The Sun. In addition the more subdued and tranquil tracks all bring out that great angelic voice. C'mon C'mon gives one a snapshot into the incredible range of Sheryl Crow's artistry which is why so many music legends are willing to perform with her. The more you listen- as with almost all her work, you will grow to appreciate her music more."
4,Excellent,This album is very good. I like almost each song. This album is the second best Sheryl Crow album.
1,Can I Send It Back?,"If Amazon let customers return a CD merely because it stinks, I'd send this back in a New York minute. I absolutely LOVE Sheryl's other stuff, but this is like eating bubble gum for dinner compared with her earlier works. Gone are the dark songs with nothing but Sheryl's plaintive and contemplative voice. Gone is her wonderfully flippant creativity. They're replaced with overdone, overproduced made-for-radio pop. You'll love the songs the first time you hear them, and be sick of them by the third. How disappointing!"
1,Poor Sheryl,"I am sorry but this album was awful. I was and still am in love with Tuesday Night Music Club, but this album is mindless pop filler."
5,She keeps getting BETTER!,"Sheryl Crow is an artist that I've liked since her first album. I keep expecting her to lose her groove like some other new female artists (Jewel...0304), but she keeps getting better!When I bought this album I was on a cross-country road trip and NEEDED some new music. I fully expected to be disappointed just because I thought Sheryl would eventually get 'stale'. Amazingly, some 2.5 years later this CD still stands up to any other! She's still got her edge!"
2,"Sheryl, what happened?","If you're like me who admired Sheryl for her tough-girl attitude and great songwriting, spare yourself the agony. Most of the songs will leave you thinking ""Haven't I heard this song before?"" (especially ""Diamond Road"" and ""It's So Easy"") and there's a preponderance of ""Love-hurts-so-get-drunk-and-cry-in-your-drink"" kinda songs (ESPECIALLY ""C'mon C'mon"" , ""It's So Easy"" and ""Over You"") that lack both the edge and depth of Crow's previous work. NOW we understand why after this album she decided to take a break from making music. That said, there are still some tracks that are up to her usual standard. I recomend downloading ""Safe and Sound"", ""Lucky Kid"" and ""Steve McQueen""... proof that while Sheryl may have missed the mark with this album, she's still got what it takes, somewhere in there."
3,"Compared to Her Others, its Ok, OK...","This is probably the only Sheryl Crow album in which I feel that there are actually Fillers on it (forgive me for saying it!). There are great rockers on it like steve mcqueen, soak up sun and even the cute ABilene, but when you hear Your an Original you'll be surfin through Filler City.Safe and Sound feels like a forced ballad. As if Sheryl thought, ""I just have to make a song for 9/11, I just gotta!"" I dont know, the song does nothing for me...C'mon C'mon, the title track, is a super honest to goodness hit. I hope it does really well on the radio if ever released.Best quote from the album ""You took the best of me and threw it away...too bad the rest of me still wants you to stay!""My personal favorite is her second album aptly title Sheryl Crow, which contains the hit If it makes you happy. If that happens to be your favorite also, then you will also feel that this album has fillers on it.We still love you Sheryl :)"
4,sheryl shines,"love the record, love sheryl, love the direction. love soak up the sun for a light spirited lift. really a great record. am loving it more each listen!"
2,Waste of money,The plastic support pipes are very flimsy. My 2 yr old daughter bent them very easily just climbing in and out of the tent and the clubhouse kept collapsing on her. The clubhouse and tent are now in the garbage. The only durable piece is the tunnel. My daughter loves to play in it. The tunnel is easy to collapse and store as well. It is the only piece of the set I would recommend.
3,Not the greatest..,"Songs were ok, but certainly not great. A little disappointed. Poor mixing job on some of them. There were a few that were ""great"" but that's about all."
3,Strategies For Whom?,"The ""Book of Five Rings"" is an ancient text from the renowned Japanese samurai teacher, which was written in 1645. The introduction, which is necessary to read to understand the environment and the political state of japan during the period when the author wrote the book, will put anybody to sleep.The text consists of five individual books:1.) Ground2.) Water3.) Fire4.) Wind5.) VoidEach book goes into a specific type of combat for various situations and weapons, which can be brought over into every life of business people. To understand all of the five books, one meeds to read them at least five times.I was expecting a lot more from this book but it left me more dissapointed than anything. If you are looking for an understandable book on strategy that can be applied to business, I would highly recommend reading Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War""."
2,"Disappointing for what it is. (the format, NOT the text)","For whatever reason, the publishers decided to leave out portions of the text, and add a massive amount (about 40% of the already shortened book) of Japanese history with photos.The history is great. The photos are. . . Photos.If you've any interest in this subject, find a copy of the Shambhala Dragon Edition by Thomas Cleary. It's much more complete, much more more readable, and was actually translated by Thomas Cleary(!), a world reknown scholar on the subject.This poor representation of such a powerful, important book almost relagates it to the dingy shelf of the ""coffee-table book."", and that's a real same."
5,The helix of learning,"One of the most illuminating books I have ever read and one of the best works on strategy ever written. Musashi takes the reader into the world of helical learning. The novice sets off understanding the book at face value and as his understanding of strategy gets more advanced through study, he comes to the realization that the advanced techniques are actually the basics, the same but taken to a higher level. He has gone full circle and arrived at the beginning but at a higher level than whence he started.But it doesn't stop there, making the circuit again and again and each time rising ever higher in understanding he progresses through the purely physical applications into the mental and spiritual applications of Musashi's ideas thus honing mind, body and spirit and fusing it to will, showing him how to succeed in adversity.A timeless classic and life-changing book."
4,"Occidentials, Read Chrysanthemum and Sword First","I found this book difficult to digest because, unlike Art of War, it doesn't contain clear 'do's and don'ts'. Instead it talks of doing things with certain 'feelings' with the ultimate goal of becoming formless. There are multiple levels of meaning such that on first reading there seems little sense. After contemplating a passage you develop a minor understanding. After expert application, another understanding, and so on. A Westerner can better understand this book after reading The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. Even so, it has taken me almost two years of martial arts training to begin to understand the concepts in this book.Yes, the concepts are applicable to modern life. But are they effective? Maybe."
3,Not quite there,I like the BBW stories but this one was not fully developed. Why does the hero love the main character? Why does the main character agree to a marriage of convenience when there are other options in modern times. The villain was not fully explained either. I liked both the male and female leads but I wish the story was more fully developed. I found myself skipping paragraphs.
2,It was okay,"Really the story had potential. Unfortunately it never reached it. Most of the scenarios are just plain ridiculous. Especially the leads and their interaction about divorce and all that. And more so with the villain. I mean, Really come on. Quite silly."
2,A Bit Disappointing,"I guess I should've known better than to think after 8 years, Sade would not change her sound, but....I found Lover's Rock quite disappointing. I've gotten used to the tunes after hearing the CD several times, and it is now tolerable. But comparing it to the unforgettable jazzy and seductive songs like in ""Promise"", this one fails to deliver. I found some of the guitar here to be somewhat ""choppy"" and ""squeaky"", and it was almost as if I'm hearing folk music instead of smooth jazz. Although, I'm giving it more than 1 star because her voice is still undeniably excellent and above the rest. Yet, some artists need to realize that change isn't always good, and trying to ""update"" your sound doesn't always mean success. Sade, it's your old sound that made you an icon in the first place, and is also the reason why fans still yearn for you after all these years...so bring it back!"
5,This Composition By Sade Is Well Worth The Wait!!,"After many years of waiting only to settle for her greatest hits CD, Sade has returned in a big fashion with groovin beats, bass and drum tracks and her same sensual voice. She has composed and successfully completed another classic CD for all Sade fans to enjoy. The sound is a lot like her old work but that is her trademark sound and she still delivers it on every track. Favorite tracks are : Slave Song, Flow, King Of Sorrow and Every Word. Go and get this one in a hurry................. Sade is Back!!oNe"
4,Lovers Rock... Food for the Soul,"I have been following Sade and Sweetback. This is a natural progression for the band, and the songs are timeless yet updated. I suspect most of the sonic sounds of this record have been culled by the Sweetback sessions, and for those who follow Stuart Matthewman, Maxwell and Santessa.The ones that stand out are 'Somebody Already Broke My Heart', which is haunting, defeatist, and hopeful - achieving all of this with simple juxtaposition of vocal and keyboard arrangements; 'Immigrant' which is one of the most powerful songs I have heard this year; and 'Lovers Rock' which ties the album together.I understand some of the reviewers and their dissapointment, but to them I say that Sade has slightly changed, albeit subtly, and it benefits them greatly.Sade is a band who respects where they've been, know where they're going, and gonna take their sweet time in getting there. I'll be right there with them."
4,"The ""First lady of Cool"" is Back...","....And she is as cool as ever! This set, while mostly acoustic, is definately the music you want to have on when unwinding from a long day (who wouldn't want Sade singing ""By Your Side"" to them after a crappy day???). Also, this is great entertaining music, perfect for the guests coming over for the Holidays - during drinks (champagne,'natch).The entire disc flows nicely and ""the 1st Lady"" is in fine voice...it's almost as if time has stood still for her. Dispite all of the ""clutter"" in her life, she has put out an excellent product. In fact, it will undoubtably withstand the same test of time that ""Love Deluxe"" and all of her older CDs have weathered. My only (minor) complaint is that the CD is a tad short. But, to want more of Sade isn't a bad thing.....is it???Buy this disc...you will not be disappointed."
5,Perfect chill out music,"This is a great album of mellow chill-out music. It's uncluttered and spacious, and the voice is so fine. I like her band by itself too (Sweetback). Wonder how long she'll take to follow this one up? I'd never heard of Sade before Lovers Rock (ah, youth), but now I have their entire catalog (plus Sweetback) which I'm slowly discovering. My best musical investment in awhile."
5,Simply brilliant,"Lovers Rock has definitely been worth the wait. The entirealbum is fantastic. Saw her in concert on monday, absolutelysuperb."
3,My heart was broken,"I am a huge Sade fan which is why I bought this CD w/ no hesitation. I thought that she was true to her mellow soulful sounds and meaningful lyrics but this CD lacked a little something to give it that true Sade legendary flava. I found myself asking, ""All these years for this?"" It's a great bubble bath CD and worth buying if you're an avid fan, but not a Sade classic. It's anti-climactic and I was a little disappointed."
2,numbing and dull,"If you are a Sade fan, do not buy this CD. The lyrics and melodies are dull and inane and the stripped down production cheapens the whole effort. The subtle piano and guitar tracks are buried so deep you have to strain to hear them over the over-boosted, thumping bass and synthetic drums. I've tried hard to like this CD but to no avail."
1,So disappointed,I waited 8 years for this?? This CD is so depressing --- everything sounds the same. I'm so so disappointed.
2,not as pleased as everyone else...,"i am with the group mind in loving SADE's earlier works, most all of it, and the recent excitement of the new releases have caught me as well, and now that i am the owner of the LOVERS ROCK, i hear little in it the excites me. what i love about SADE's earlier songs is her powerful understanding of the true depth of love and of it's workings deep within our hearts. what a life she must have had! yet i found none of this in her new release. i also found little music artistry either, particulary with the drum machine accompaniment. i see that i am in the minority, and that is why i decided to voice this opinion."
5,One of the best songwriters ever!,"This is another oddball in my collection of mostly heavy metal. Sade is simply one of the best lyricists I have ever heard! My favorite song is ""Slave Song"" and ""By Your Side"" comes in at a close second. ""Flow"" and ""King Of Sorrow"" are also amazing. Great work, and I'm looking forward to her next release."
4,Relaxing,"I purchased Sade's Lover's rock album back in 2000-2001. I found her album to really satify my need to relax and think about situations I was going through. Her delightful voice combined with her soulful lyrics produces a serine enviorment for any true music lover. Lover's Rock is not much different from any other album she has previously released. Her songs are based on the same topics, love and relationships which I feel to be a good thing it shows consistency. Lover's Rock has proven for me to be the best song on the album, and it's also the the title for the album.Her hit single King of sorrow also display her talent and ability to touch her audience. I plan to have this album in my cd rotation for a long time."
2,very average,"i dig Sade i have all of her Albums plus Imports,etc....but this set doesn't really showcase her all that well.i was looking for horns&things but this set didn't move me.it felt like it was just there.good lyrics but the music goes nowhere.it is just there.considering She drops a Disc once every 5 plus years you would expect a little more overall depth&something different.still i listen to her older stuff.but this won't be getting much play."
2,It Sure Is A Crime...,"The drum and bass tracks on this album overwhelm any other sounds. These almost sound like unfinished tracks, awaiting the addition of horns and strings. Aside from rhythm, the only other sound is a guitar. Sade's vocals are buried in the mix. After sitting through 11 numbing tracks of beating and pounding, one longs for some of the sweet saxaphone solos on previous Sade hits such as ""Your Love Is King"" and ""Is It A Crime""."
3,Bringing back the good old days!,"A great set of DVDs of a show long lost forgotten. However, its a wonderful thing to bring them back when we can. I remember this show very much, however, i thought there were more episodes than 15?...but anyways, i was really happy to get this to add to my childhood memories. Recommended !!"
2,Ego overcomes environment,"I could only read about 20 pages of this book, it wasnot clear to me that Lawrence needed to leave England towrite this . The new Landscapes, villages, and people onlyseem an excuse to get a never ending internal dialogue involvinghis views and prejudices. I want a travel book to be likegood reporting, with the author only visible by the style of writing.Joseph Mitchell is without peer in this method.It might be more enjoyable if his views were not uniformly obvious orboring."
5,Excellent and listenable!,I can listen to this one over and over. Never gets old - always a classic. Timeless songs on this album.
2,Joke,"I will save you a few dollars right now. Stay focused.While this book gives somewhat of a good explanation on how to GET the job,some nice vocabulary and things to keep in mind, the author did a really poorjob on explaining the little details the job really consists of.She keeps on saying that it's all personal and that you have to work out apartner relationship with your boss. Over and over. You have to be accurate.Oh really? That's something new.Did I mention a ton of spelling mistakes? She devotes a few pages to remind us thatwe have to know how to spell since our boss might not.To be short. This book is NOT worth it. Unless, of course, you are COMPLETELYnew to seeking a job. Just watch or read (better to read), ""The devil wears Prada""You'll get much more info...Good luck"
3,Oh Franz Ferdinand...,"When I first listened to Franz Ferdinand's first album I was in love. I was so excited for this release. Indeed, it lived up to the Franz Ferdinand sound. It's groovy, great and fun to listen to, makes you want to stand up and jump, etc. The problem I have with it is that it sounds similar, actually, the same, as their previous release. It's hard to change your sound but it's a big deal when your music sounds too similar. If you liked their first album there is no doubt that you will like this one. But, just be warned that if you're looking for something new, you won't find it."
2,Not all that great & too much hype.,"The album has one great song and thats ""Do you want to."" Now don't mistake me this album has some more good songs but only one great song. If your like me then your better off downloading the single. Don't waste your money. Spend it on New Order ""Singles""."
4,Excellent follow up effort.,"I bought this the day it came out on Dual disc. The DVD side is fun to watch and see the musicians off stage and behind the scenes. They are very impressively creative...even trying to record a babbling brook for effect despite it sounding like rubbish and being axed from the final mix. They are great song writers, and the pop mix of 80s rock, funk and rockabilly is refreshing in today's declining music scene. I love their first album so much that I had to give this album one less star, but this album is a very solid second album. You won't go wrong with it if you like the first record."
3,"Horrible single, good album.","There's no way Franz Ferdinand's high-energetic follow up is better then it's smash hit debut ""Franz Ferdinand- Self Titled"". While it's still a good album (and if you're a true fan, still worth the money) the lyrics seemed to be dumbed down, and not as original as in the first album. Has a few great tracks, but the cd is brought down by the single ""Do You Want To"", and a couple others.Hopefully Franz Ferdinand bring it all back with the next album, I'll definitely be anticipating it."
3,It's just about the music!,"Franz Ferdinand is the best band to come along in years.In many ways they are like DEEP PURPLE (my all time favorite band) who continue to thrive outside of the good old U.S.A. Why? Because it's just about the music.There's not alot of fashion statement, no real trendy crap and no techno bull. Just good rock music!When I heard FF on SNL, I was pretty impressed. They had that same essence which I've only seen in Purple. There was that raw in your face, well played rock music, well, I became an instant fan.You Could Have It So Much Better and Rapture Of The Deep (DP's latest) are two of my two favorite discs right now, with every song being good to excellent! Just when I was giving up on new music, both FF and DP come through with great new discs. These albums get better with each listen. Celebrate!3 1/2 stars: You Could Have It So Much Better5 stars: Rapture Of The Deep"
1,Stylized Flop,"I first listened to Franz Ferdinand looking for another band to add to my music collection and found wonderful bass lines and funky guitar with a unique style that was actually worth listening to. The first album was perfect other than the band's decision on what to release as a single, Take Me Out, which was not one of the best tracks on the self-titled album.After enjoying the first album, out comes ""You Could Have It So Much Better"" which proves what is wrong with music these days. Consumers get so wrapped up in the ""right"" music that it sells but there is no artistic merit in either deed. Franz Ferdinand's second album is all noise with no music at all. The lyrics have no effect because the effects of guitar amps take over and leave the listener disappointed in a once great band.Just as Newsweek called The Hives and Strokes stylized flops, Franz Ferdinand can now be added to that category and be put on the garbage heap of pop-rock history."
3,Could Have Used More Variety,"Being a big fan of Franz Ferdinand's first piece of work, especially the classic ""Take Me Out,"" I checked out their follow-up album to see if they could avoid the sophomore slump and provide us some more rock anthems. This album has a problem though in the lack of variety. Either their sound doesn't permit a great deal of variety, or the vocals don't permit it. Either way, it's a very monotonous record.In fact, the first track is the best track, and it's the best gauge to see if you're going to like the rest of the album, because if you love the song, then you can stand listening to the whole album in one sitting. Otherwise, you're out of luck. Not to say it's a bad album, it just could have used more depth to it. So, hardcore fans unite, everybody else find other means.Real Score: 2.5"
5,The Best,"I tried this years ago, and could not believe it....the ONLY thing I cannot stand..is the SMELL...omg...strong perfume, like mens cologne...it does not stay toolong, but the benefits outweight the stink...I have tried ALL the others and they are thick, and within hours your hair is sticky and oily with still frizz, but not with this .Others say they love the smell, I guess it's an indiviual thing, I am not much for strong perfumes, wish they made it with no smell! Lasts a long time, only need a few drops, what I find it is like silk on your hangs, it glides...on with ease. Buy it!"
3,Interesting collection of management success stories,"This is an interesting collection of short (1 to 3 pages) accounts of management successes. However, I went into it hoping to get insight into the decision process of great managers and did not find it. In fact, it was not even clear whether these were good decisions or merely good outcomes.""The Greatest Lessons"" that followed each account were interesting, but they had no cohesion. In fact some were contradictory: ""Style is all"" (decision #2) or ""give people something that is useful and informative"" (23)? ""Move on"" (4) or ""persist and then persist some more"" (10)? ""Change constantly"" (16) or ""continue the legacy"" (19)? ""Trust your nose"" (24) or ""innovations need believers""(25)? Enjoy the stories and draw your own lessons. You can probably find a story here to back up any management theory you choose."
5,Unjustly neglected duo,"The Argentinean husband-and-wife team of Graciela Pomponio and Jorge Martínez Zárate was one of the best guitar duos of its day, although unfortunately rather in the shadow of Presti/Lagoya.Had I known this album existed, I would have bought it years ago, to replace my worn-out LP. The recordings were made in France in 1960, under the gis of Robert J. Vidal, and contain some wonderful music not easily obtainable elsewhere — for instance, the delightful ""Suite for Two Guitars"" by the Rumanian Armin Kauffman.Here are the contents:Sonate Concertante (Paganini)Largo & Rondo (Carulli)Nacht und Traüme (Schubert)Rumores de la Caleta (Albéniz)Le petit nègre (Debussy)Pavane, Op. 50 (Fauré)Romance sans paroles, Op. 17, N 3 (Fauré)Suite for 2 Guitars (Kauffmann)Preludio & Danza (Martínez Zárate)Sonatina y variación (Moreno Torroba)The total time is 59'30""."
3,Boring,I was hopping for a little more christmas. There lots of mid evel theme video instead of live stage concert proformance. Not my cup of tea.
3,Incorrect Track List,"This is a great song, but the track list is incorrect. I ordered the cd because of all the remixes that are listed, but when I received the cd it only has the album version and the no rap version.If you are wanting any of the other remixes listed on the track listing, look elsewhere because you will not find them on this disc."
1,Wow - really bad,"Really bad and boring. I'm very interested in stuff like this, but way to take something interesting and turn it into a snoozer!"
4,Great Water Boiler,"The T-Fal 4-Cup Vitesse Electric Water Kettle is a great little kitchen device. Not only is it attractive, but very useful. My experience has found that it can bring one liter of water to boil is a matter of a few short minutes. I love my T-Fal Vitesse that I even bring it with me on vacation, because you never know how clean the coffee machine/water kettle is in the hotel you are staying in. The little kettle is holding up very well, with only a few scraches due to traveling. It has only failed me only once (hence the 4 star rating) when the kettle prematuredly shut off, but that maybe because of my power convertor, as I was in Hong Kong using the kettle. Definitely a must have for every household. Mine was made in France!"
3,"Not quite what i expected, but it is OK","It is not what I expected, it is more of an instrutional item and My wife and I did not really learn anything new from it!"
5,Great boots!,"I have a foot that is wide in the front and narrow in the back. These Danner's in EE are PERFECT with a pair of good heavy wool socks. They're light as anything and great to walk in from the very start. As they are not re-solable they may not be great for heavy users, but for the few times a year that I'll use them the certainly do the trick. I plan on buying another insulated pair in 1000 gram thinsulate for cold weather. I highly recommend these boots for hunting."
4,Almost what I was looking for,"This angle plug is the usual Leviton good quality product. It is well made, very easy to do a professional job of connecting to a cord.However, I needed a plug that I could lead a fairly heavy extension cord away from an outlet in a desired direction other than an angle simply lined up with an existing horizontal outlet. There are other plugs that do allow an adjustment to rotate and lock into one of several cord directions.While this plug does do a really good job of keeping the cord close to the mounting surface, it only allows one cord direction away from the outlet.These angle plugs are a bit hard to find so I will be keeping the plug for other applications because of the quality and ease of connecting to a cord. I do like the way that an angle plug carries the weight of a heavy cord without trying to twist itself out of an outlet."
4,"OK, works like it should.",I make my own extension cords. These are cheaper here than at Home Depot. I would buy them again for the price.
3,Important premise but pretty basic stuff,"Clearly trust is crucial to successful and functional relationships. And, I agree it is based on both Character and Competence. When something is important, you really need those two things, at a minimum, to feel good about your task and chances with or without a team to work with.I agree and that seems to be the book's premise. The book goes on but that is really what you need to know AND actually do.With all the talk of trust in the market today and the simplicity of the model you'd think that there would be more of it around. Not as common as one might hope, especially in our prime organizations, or at least the lack thereof seems more evident and consequential."
4,Insightful Book - Important Subject!,"In this best-selling book Mr. Covey (son of Stephen R. Covey) explores the role of trust in human commerce and in human life today. He looks at the ways in which character and competence, personal integrity and performance form the foundation of trust.Building on that, he explores the ways that, in our fast-paced world, trust becomes THE key that unlocks doors. In this day and age we simply don't have time to check everything out thoroughly. So when things are happening quickly and decisions need to be made in the moment, what do we fall back on? Trust.In this insightful and practical book, Mr. Covey looks at what builds trust, what erodes trust, and what an important factor it is in enhancing productivity and creating satisfying relations -- whether you're looking at commercial or personal relationships.Stephen M. R. Covey has done his father proud, and written an important book for our times."
5,Empowering and Motivating,A great cause and effect approach to understanding the importance of trust. It reminds you that change begins with you.
3,a suggested book,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
5,His writing and business acument surpass his father!,"His writing and business acument surpass his father! Excellent, easy to read and very relevant to our business environment today.He has the same gifts of business acumen and writing that his father, Steve Covey. I have a whole liabray of Steve Covey's books, and look forward to continuing to fill my bookshelf with the next generation Covey!"
5,Wavy Navy,"SUPERB BOOK, a Classic I use this title because the story is written from the viewpoint of a RNVR Officer (a prewar voluntary reserve officer, background and qualifications yachtsman). I mention this because having a father that served on USN convoy duty before the war started (USS Jacob Jones), and having lived in the UK amongst many who also served in the war, I realize now that the book and the film provide an accurate and vividly emotional portrayal of what it was like. Also, add to list of why ""There will always be an England"""
2,Ground prong broke off,Unfortunately the ground prong broke off when the cord was jerked so that was disappointing. Apparently the prong is made from very brittle metal.
4,A great read,"""The Qualinesti"" is definately a great book. Not only is it full of action and adventure. But it come across with actual real emotions that people can relate too. There is jealousy, deceit, sadness and many other emotions filling this book. I had heard mixed reviews about this book before I read it. But, I was pleasently suprised by how good this book actually was. I liked it as much, of not more, than ""The Firstborn"" (The first book in this trilogy). This book brings about the end of a legacy. It is a little depressing, but it is nice to see the state of the Qualinesti under the leadership of Kith-Kanan and his son. A definate must for Dragonlance fans."
1,"BEWARE of this Alpha Video DVD, it is BAD!","I can not tell you much about the movie, the Gotham Distributors/ Alpha Video DVD is so bad that I had to stop it 10 minutes in and force the store to accept the return of an open DVD.The AUDIO is DISTORDED, making it very hard to understand Leo Gorcey's humorous banter.The VIDEO is WASHED OUT so that you can not see their faces.The film print they used was also splicy, but that would have been tolerable if you could see & hear the movie. Wait until someone like Platinum, Front Row, Brentwood, or Goodtimes releases this public domain title."
3,get it for free,go to www.archive.org and you can download this film and hundreds of others for FREE. It's legal too.
3,Hard to watch,"First, I'm glad that someone (Alpha Video) is offering this movie. It's worth having. But, my copy was so choppy and boogery, it was hard to follow what was going on. Lots of the dialog was cut up so badly I had to guess what was being said. So, if you don't mind being frustrated and love the East Side Kids, go ahead and get this. Maybe someday TCM or someone else will dig in and remaster the entire 20 ESK movies. Do you hear me TCM?"
4,viva vitesse,"if you are looking for a safe, high-speed tea kettle, with clean lines, no-drip spout, and carafe design, Vitesse has it all. It's easy to keep clean and holds 7 cups; perfect when you want hot water in a hurry for your tea pot or french press coffee maker."
5,This baby is sweet 2,"I wanted to add to my other review how convenient it is to keep clean. Even though this unit brings an ice cold cup of water to a full rolling boil, in only a minute, that minute is plenty of time to really heat up the inside. What does that mean? Well it makes clean up a non existent chore. When I am done pouring my cup of tea, I simply lift the lid and let the steam escape. Since the inside of the unit is boiling hot, the existing water on the sides and bottom help the water to evaporate completely. So the inside becomes completely dry all by itself in about a minute.Hot steamy disinfected water, then totally dry, and I mean totally dry with no effort, and no wiping, no soaping, no scrubbing.I just thought I would mention that. I discovered by accident when I left the lid open. I guess you can tell how much I like this high speed kettle. I came back to write another review. See my first one, This baby is sweet."
5,Best Christmas Gift Ever,"I bought this pot for my tea-drinking husband. It has been one of the most wonderful purchases I have ever made. The water heats up very quickly and it takes very little counter space. Another wonderful feature is that it shuts itself off when the water boils so there is no boiling over of forgotten pots (a problem we have had frequently in the past). It also shuts itself off when picked up. The only down side is that it can sound a bit like a jet engine taking off when first heating up. All in all, a wonderful product."
5,An excellent piece!,"I've had mine for two months and it is a wonderful appliance for the money. It brings water to a boil quickly, is convenient and have had no trouble. I like tea and make coffee in a french press, so I boil water often."
4,No household should be without one!,"It's great - easy and durable. My only wish was that it wasn't plastic on the inside, since I think that affects the taste of the water just a bit....perhaps if they would line the inside (which comes in contact with the water) with some special coating to protect it or something, e.g. stainless steel? Anyway, it's not in there boiling for very long. Basically, it's a good design and works and is reasonably priced, too."
4,Can it be this simple???,YES! I popped it in and after getting passed the wallpaper and wardrobe --- I learned how to do EFT. It was so much better than a book or CD. I could see it all and now I practice it on any resistance.
3,"Good information, but boring","This video was very informative about EFT. It explains the history of EFT, techniques of tapping, and shows practices of EFT with clients. However, this video is about as attention capturing as watching paint dry while eating unsalted saltine crackers, and I found it hard to stay awake to watch all the way through. I think it might be discouraging for some people new to EFT to watch simply because it is so dry and boring."
2,Russian Cooking,This book was not complete. There was a small spiral cookbook that was a companion. That's what I was really interested in.
5,Great book,"Very much enjoyed the human side of a very technical tale. Thought it was written in a very engaging way. Would especially recommend for those who have studied electricity in school, but certainly electrical knowledge is not required."
2,Measurements are way off,"This product is actually 3.8"" tall and 1.6"" diameter. Not even close to those listed in description. Otherwise works ok."
1,Save your money,"This game is very difficult (even the easy level.) It has a lot of bugs. Clicking Help on the main screen freezes my computer. The objects are difficult to manipulate when they overlap anything. Everything has to be in perfect alignment for the puzzle to be solved, which is very difficult to do. I am returning it to Sierra for a refund."
3,Not as good as the original.,"I bought this game because I am a huge fan of the original game that came out in the 90's. Unfortunately it isn't as good as that one, and often times is much more annoying. It's not as hard as the original either. Also the music is terrible compared to the amazing tracks from the original game, and I wish I could turn off that guy's annoying voice.What I really would like would be for this company to release the original game again in a way that is supported by the latest versions of Windows. I still have my old disk but it won't run anymore. Quite a shame. :("
4,David Holmes - Gritty Shaker,"David Holmes' second disc of _Gritty Shaker_ remixes (which comes in a slimline case, rather than a cardboard case like the 1st disc) features future jazz stalwarts Red Snapper doing a mix that combines quick breaks with blippery and a funk bass. The siren-like tone on the original gets vibrated until it's corresponds to the rest of the jittery, funky track. The b-side ""Suicidal Weed"" is a slowly chugging train through Old West territory."
3,The Devil on Wheels,Cute little movie that I actually owned on 16mm film and had not seen it in years so when it came out on DVD I bought it and I rated it just good because it is not the best quality copy but it has a good story centered on driving safely and the background for the story is the 1950's
3,Sartre's philosophies turned into a narrative,"Like many of his more philosophical works, Jean-Paul Sartre dealt with almost taboo (at least in the 40s) social issues on the Age of Reason, usch as abortion, concubinary, the quest for personal freedom, and the government. The Age of Reason does drag somewhat, since it's a good 300 pages long, but it's worth reading, since some of the parts in this book are very well-written and keeps you in suspense throughout the length of the book."
1,nothing stirs up hate like calling people nazis,authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world.this stuff would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. The left cries about McCarthism but is doing the exact same thing here by creating villians and devils where there are none.Peddeling hate and fear even if based on loose facts or lies works for some.
4,Worth a listen.,"Where the GLU ep and Empty had coherent limits to them, Life In The So Called Space Age seems boundless. The beats are bigger and the vocals are more appealing this time around, but you can also tell that they grew as musicians. The only real problem is the change. Their early formula was very good, not to detract from the new one. GLU also seems to have a wonderful tongue in cheek approach to the music they are embracing, especially with what seems to be the breaking down of their drum machine in Vapors. Regardless, a wonderful album and a good starting place for newcomers to the band."
2,It's good for kids.....,".....but I'm not a kid. From an adult viewpoint, there are far better shows to watch if you enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, or space opera. This show is extremely simplistic and perhaps worth a revisit for nostalgia, but not worth spending money.A few series I recommend (either for yourself or kids) that won't insult the intelligence: Star Trek, Twilight Zone, Planet of the Apes Weekly Series, Land of the Lost, Buck Rogers, Quantum Leap, Outer Limits, Stargate."
1,This book is dated and boreing!,"If you arn'd a hige fan of judy blume, I would not recommend this book. It takes place in 1973 and all of the characters act this way. Also, all the book is about is a little girs who's parents got divorced. Personally, I think watching paint dry would be more exciting. The only reason I personally read the book, was because it was assigned for school! So unless you need a good sedative, I would not recommend this book."
5,"Optimistic, encouraging, inspiring!","Judy does it again! This book is so real. Sometimes divorce is the BEST thing that can happen to a family. At the time, divorce might be upsetting & Karen's family goes through a ""mourning period"" as families need to when the parents' marriage ends. But what this book excellently illustrates & that Karen comes to realize, is that divorce does NOT mean the end of a family or a ""broken home."" She realizes that her mother is much happier & more relaxed, even though her mom cries when she remembers the marriage. One good message I got from the book was that it is better for a kid to grow up in a peaceful single-parent home than a tense two-parent home filled with fighting. Parts of the book are sad, but without being depressing. This book is very uplifting & inspiring the way Karen & her family pick up the pieces, rebuild & by the end, you know they're still a family & will go on."
4,Helpful book.,This great book really helped me and my twin sister when our parents were getting a divorce. It is about a girl who's parents are divorced and basicly she wants them back togther. Grest helpful book. Buy IT!
5,My top five,"This movie is one of the most underrated I know of. The cast is among the best ever assembled. Every time I watch it,I see more of the penetrating insights it contains."
5,Never Taken One That Made Me Feel Like I'd Slept 12 Hrs,"This is one of the best movies of the past 50 years -- stunning, dramatic, captivating, shocking, saddening, brutal and wonderful. Never has a better cast been assembled, and never has a cast performed better. Never has dialogue been so riveting. The performances are like music, like songs you relish hearing again and again. The realism is obvious to anyone who has ever worked in an office where profits are all that matter. Watch this movie today, and again from time to time. It is magnificent.""How can you present investment opportunities without television, without magazine ads? I say, you take something this good, you go to a man has invested in the past, you go to him direct and offer the money to him: REBATE!""The spiels just don't come much slicker than this, at the hands of the immortal Jack Lemmon. P.S. Put that coffee down."
1,WHINEY OLD MEN...,"I feel like I was the one who was scammed! This movie is about whiney old men...and each one says the ""F"" word more often than the one before him. ""Death of a Salesman"" it is NOT! More like ""Death of Some More Time"""
3,"Kept stopping, had issues with streaming","The movie was good, but I kept having issues with the streaming and the movie freezing. I don't know if its amazon or my internet"
2,Kill Me Now.,"Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film. It's so aggravating. I want to chew my own leg off half way into it. I know part of it is everyone is a ""talker"" of a various sort. They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell. I just don't think it works. Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived. The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves. It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name. Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen."
2,Overrated.,"The stars are for the superb acting of veteran actors, Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Ed Harris."
1,Complete dissapointment,What is the point of this movie? The vulgar languange and psychotic behavior leave a lot to be desired. I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie!
3,Disappointment,Maybe I was expecting to much as I've heard from many people how great this movie was. It had superb acting by Jack Lemmon but other than that it dragged quite a bit.
3,An Okay follow up album,"The Year of the Spider is an okay follow up album for '13 ways to bleed on stage'. Unfortunately it has some more slower songs on it, which in my oppinion could've been left out and put on an 'unplugged album' (Maybe a good idea to do someday guys!) but in the long run it will still rock yr socks off! My favorite song still is stupid gurl. It seems like my cd player ate this cd and for some reason can't spit it out cuz it's too damn good!"
3,"Half good, half, well, not so good","Not being a Cold fan, but wanting to try this Cd out, i got it. The first song, Remedy, was pretty good. So was the third song, Cure my Tragedy, and the songs Wasted Years and Whatever you became. However, the other songs on this album not only have no catchy melodies, impressive lyrics, some of them are really quite Stupid. In suffocate, a girls voice saying in a whiny tone "" i dont lie. i'm not fake"" ruins the song. The day seattle died was a tribute to grunge gone wrong, and kill the music industry is like an attempt to be cool by insulting the music industry. I laughed out loud when i saw the title of the song. It is like a boring version of Korn's y'all want a single. All in all, while this album has a few memorable songs, get it from the library, not from the CD store."
5,Greatness,A great new album by a great band. The skill they have for weaving such haunting meoldies borders on genius. The most overlooked band out there in my opinion.
5,Cold Rocks Again,This CD is great...they have some really rockin' songs but they also have some mellow ones...stupid girl is a really great song.This CD is good from beginning to end. Cold Rocks...peace out.oh yeah...this has nothing to do w/it but get Good Charlotte. They rock!k/r gc
1,Useless book,This book is useless. Please don't waste time on this book. It doesn't give you any new knowledge.
2,"What is the point, pyrotechnically speaking?","Once again the Kosankes toot their own horns, and trot out another assemblage of poorly edited tripe. Not that it's so bad, it's just not so good. We ought to expect better from someone who promotes himself as the world's foremost authority on pyrotechnics.By the way, this is not even properly speaking, a book. It's more of a technical report bound in a cheesey plastic-faced report cover. I should look a little more closely -- this might not even be real offset printing, but a xerographic reproduction. Looking at teh sales rank, it may be that the numbers sold don't support the costs of real printing and binding, which entail an up-front financial risk.This book remains on my shelf, a reminder now and then of the old adage, caveat emptor!"
3,Who This Book is For,"This book is ok, it has good information. But the information isn't too acuret. This book is good if you are intrested in Pirotecnics, but not to serious with it. If you are just learning how to blow stuff up, and if you aren't doing anything big then this is the book for you!"
5,Pain remover,"This product is as good as the illustration. It offers a soothing massage for relaxing stiff muscles, reduces stress and stimulate circulation. The color and the shape are very well coordinated for massage. However, to enhance work out a youtube video or a visit to a massager I will recommend. Otherwise, it will become another device in storage.The sound levels are good and the weight is good. If you like to release tightness caused by daily stress this is the product to get."
1,who in the world produced this cd? and why?,"Listen man, I have jammed to desol LIVE I'm sure MANY MORE times than the next person and I was a huge supporter of Spanish Radio too, but lets be serious...this new version is TERRIBLE! The cover is awful and the music sounds WAY TOO COMMERCIAL!!! Everything they went against they became...karma."
4,"Not your typical Asbury Park,NJ band","Based out of Asbury Park, NJ deSol describes themselves as ""Rock & Roll with a Latin soul."". These guys can definitely rock. You have to in order to survive the club scene in NJ. Having toured with Los Lonely Boys, The Wailers, and Blues Traveler amongst others. They appeal to a wide crowd. And this disc should as well Song in mostly English with some Spanish phrases thrown in. The last 2 tracks are Spanish only tracks. Songs Blanco y Negro, Chica de Miami, Bandleader, Karma are the best songs on the disc I think. I feel deSol is a vastly under rated band that hs been overlooked for quite a while."
5,Ahhhh-some!,"Just GRRRREAT. I'll never tire watching a Bogie & Bacall movie. Never. The acting is excellent, the dialogue is JUST great, something which in today's movie is hardly ever heard, it's realistic and the scenery is so beautiful it makes you want to go and see it for yourself."
5,Bogie & Bacall box set,"Can't go wrong with any of these four titles. All the better that they're boxed together. All four are quite good but very different from each other. I think fans of these two film stars will give a variety of opinions as to which of the four is the best among them, which is to be expected with such great success, and with such a variety of different storylines and approaches by the directors & actors alike. It's a very nice collection of four truly entertaining films."
4,Bogie an Bacall.. simply magic,I've been keeping my eye on this collection for a while. I figured now was as good a time as any to purchase some of the best chemistry portrayed on film... Bogie and Bacall- good stuff ;)
3,"campy ""reefer madness"" style historical account","one-sided ""demonized castro"" perspective with a toss in a light and broadway spectacle soundtrack, made for mass consumption of this view.if you do watch this, balance it out by watching ""Fidel - The Untold Story"". what ""638 ways"" sweeps under the rug is how cuba was run by imperial puppetmen and never had regulating power of it's own. the reasons for the assassinations, reinstate more puppetmen."
5,Greatest Book,"This is a must have for all gun fans. It shows exactly how to build an automatic gun any size from 22 caliber to 12 gauge. Can be built by anyone from simple easily found materials, it looks great too."
3,Useful to those with a bit of technical skill.,"This book is great, with precise diagrams and photographs, however the material is certainly not for the layperson, although given enough time almost anyone could fabricate a device. The quality is almost certainly horrible, as they are simply composed of basic plumbing. The book is well worth the money, but don't expect an easy thing to put together in a day (at least not without help, tools, and know-how)."
5,Brilliant,"The music on this release is every bit as lush, intriguing, mystifying, and flat out gorgeous as the cover art would lead you to believe. I am a HUGE Jane's Addiction fan, but haven't been as impressed with Perry's post-Jane's work... until now. This is absolutely his best work since."
2,Remedial Philosophy Gone Wrong,"I was pretty excited when I got this book on sale. I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and I love applying different readings to my favorite texts. Not only is the text extremely basic, but the factual references, despite the over-quotation, are incorrect! Reading some of the essays, I questioned whether the authors ever read the Harry Potter books, much less any Philosophy.This isn't a discussion of philosophy in Harry Potter so much as a basic account of philosophy with some characters from the Harry Potter series thrown in for good measure.And the facts! One of the essays says that Winky is Dobby's sister. Since when? Another essay says that ""Voldemort"" means, and I quote: ""...a horrifying name that means something like 'Will to Death.' This title itself is a lie, because he doesn't have a death wish"" (140). Well of course it's a lie- that's not what ""Voldemort"" means. JK Rowling got it from the French ""vol de mort"" which means, literally, flight from/of death."
3,A Fun Read: Take it for what it is,"While the contributors only gloss the topics, it is better than reading a romance novel. If you want a better look at begging level philosophy, buy an introduction to philosophy text book: you can look at X university's philosophy department's webpage and see what they are using for intro classes. If you want some fun reading that will gloss some philosophical issues, read this book."
5,17 philosophical experts unlock some of Hogwart's secrets,"Harry Potter's put the spell on millions of readers, and many have debated the 'deeper meaning' of the stories. In Harry Potter And Philosophy, seventeen philosophical experts unlock some of Hogwart's secrets, revealing connections between the particular characters and how they link to modern philosophy. There's more than a healthy dose of humor, such in an analysis of how Aristotle would've run a school for wizard. Harry Potter And Philosophy is ""must"" reading for dedicated fans of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels and films presenting Harry Potter's detailed and complicated world."
2,So much info lost,"Please, would someone step outside of their own personal collection and write a TRUE guide to Vintage Barbie and Friends plus fashion and structures? Is it asking too much for someone to put together a comprehensive book on the first 10 or 12 years?This book would have to be much larger to cover the first 30 years of Barbie alone. There is so much missing."
5,All is Forgiven,This album is extremely soothing. I first heard it during savasanna in my yoga class and had to find it. You feel like you are floating with the angels when she sings.
5,all is forgiven,this is the best vocal rendition of Ave Maria that I have ever heard.Absolutely beautiful!I have been playing the entire alblum alot and find it spirituallyuplifting.
3,Wings At The Speed Of Sound,"Wings At The Speed Of Sound contains several McCartney classics ""Beware My Love,"" ""Let 'Em In,"" ""Silly Love Songs,"" and several lesser-known gems ""Warm And Beautiful,"" ""San Ferry Anne,"" and ""Sally G."". But the remaining tunes fall far short of the usual McCartney standard. Most feature Denny Laine on lead vocals and are mediocre at best. Also included is quite possibly the worst track ever included on a McCartney album, ""Cook Of The House"" featuring the late Linda McCartney on lead vocals. Overall, Wings At The Speed Of Sound is a poor album, but in between the awful tracks there is some fantastic McCartney material. Well worth the purchase for the McCartney songs alone ..."
3,More wings then I like but still Paul,"Despite the fact that Paul was playing nice and letting the other members of Wings take credit his melody still shines bright. Even though everyone knows he was the most talented he still let the other take a shot. The album is justified by one song alone, Warm and Beautiful. The first time I played the CD all the way through and heard this song I wanted to just fall in love...and I'm 18!"
4,"Different Flavor, Very Enjoyable","As a kid and later a DJ, this has remained one of my favorite albums of McCartney. The flavor of letting his band members perform on a few tracks gives this album the musical sound of McCartney with a twist on the vocals. Now I'm a dad, and ""Silly Love Songs"" and ""Let 'Em In"" are two of our family favorites to sing to in the car or at bedtime. Likewise, ""Beware My Love"" throughout the years has remained one of my personal favorite McCartney cuts."
3,Wings fly high in 1976,"Released prior to Wings' mega successful American tour, this album (and it's two singles) sailed to the top of the charts. Less focused than ""Band On The Run"" or ""Venus And Mars"", we still have some interesting material here. Besides the commercially successful singles ""Let 'Em In"" and ""Silly Love Songs"", we have the invigorating rocker ""Beware My Love"" (why was that a B-side?) as well as some interesting tracks by the other members. Denny Laine scores with his composition ""Time To Hide"", as well as providing lead vocal on the McCartney track ""The Note You Never Wrote"". Jimmy McCulloch contributes ""Wino Junko"", another dope song which pales in comparison with it's cousin ""Medicine Jar"" from ""Venus And Mars"". Drummer Joe English sings a wonderful lead on ""Must Do Something About It"", but Linda's vocal on ""Cook Of The House"" is, well, if you can't say anything nice..."
1,A truly awful movie!,"I couldn't make any sense out of this pretentious piece of art house crap. Maybe you can, but I doubt it.I am a reasonably intelligent person, so if I don't ""get it,"" the problem isn't with me. Don't waste your time."
5,Nothing Wrong Here,"If you like neat, spare, tidy novels where no one ever breaks wind, where the characters exercise sentimental hygiene and you leave the book feeling...vaguely...disturbed, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. This is the real thing--honesty, messy and raw emotion, unsparing insights. It's the kind of book where the narrator tells you he wishes his friend was dead because his death will be ""more beautiful than anything we have together in life."" Plus, it's funny. If you don't like it, I'm not sure I trust you as a critic and I'm sure I don't want you as a friend. Can't take it? Go find something by Anita Brookner instead. You'll find her in the ""Freezer"" section."
4,Lyrical and surprisingly seamless.,"Lyrical in its Whitmanesque trips down the LIE, across Queens; tragic in that the main character carries personal tragedies to every moment he experiences in the single day that the novel comprises; flashback after flashback, but seamless. And somehow, the novel and its narrator have nothing but respect -- and sometimes admiration -- for bridge-and-tunnel kids who think they're writers."
4,Christmas Movie Fan!,Great holiday movie to enjoy with family and friends. I purchased this movie for myself to enjoy for Christmas. This movie is not played often at Christmas on T.V.!
3,Missing Nut,"The product is as expected except for one thing... The nut to screw the lever onto the tank was missing from the package. We haven't yet contacted Amazon to see if they are able to send a replacement & don't know if we will b/c we used our old nut but you can see the nut in the picture. If you don't happen to have that nut you won't be able to get the lever to work.I hope our old nut doesn't fail b/c it was the plastic screw part of the old lever that broke. The flush lever mechanism really isn't engineered all that great in our opinion and we expect some more failure in the future but it is what works on our Toto toilet.By the way, the package didn't appear to be torn & was officially wrapped in plastic with the Toto company information so I don't know if it is a fluke that ours happened to be missing or if it actually doesn't come with the nut."
5,Came on time,"Had to fix a broken lever for my Toto. Rather than pay the outrageous price from a local plumbing store, I ordered online and received it quickly (a few days). Able to change it out myself in 15 minutes."
3,Hit and Miss,"For those who remember those great albums of the 1970s - About Us and Traveling Underground, when Ian Lloyd was singer for Stories, this album doesn't really reach the musical heights found there. There is a wide smattering of styles, a little of this, a little of that. Some of the ballad types are pretty nice, and there a few that are good dance tunes, but nothing really sticks in your head after its over. The last track is a redo of the first track of the Traveling Underground album of 1973, done at a more leisurely pace. I'm probably prejudiced, but this is the best track of the CD. If you are a die-hard Ian Lloyd fan, this is an OK album; if you've never heard him before, try Traveling Underground or even better, About Us, both Stories albums."
2,MEDIOCRITY AT IT'S WORST,"I have really never before heard such boring band with singer who has a such retard and irritating voice. All songs sound the same. ""How soon is now"" is probably only song that I could listen to. Guys...tell me please what do you see in this music? It's really nothing in it. This music has not any taste at all. If you want good bands, buy ""Dire Straits"", ""U2"" or ""Coldplay"" then. This band has no future. This is my opinion and you can shoot me if you want, but this music still will not be good."
4,cover art is good,"If the people giving reviews, on this album were smith's fans they would knowthat the cover art is in line with all the other covers. Morrissey's love of britishtv and film stars is well documented, the cover artist is charles haultry a ""carry on ""film star."
4,just like I remember,"""Bill"" was my first Mickey Rooney movie. I believed he really was a mentally challenged individual and was shocked later when I saw him in other movies.I enjoy both of these movies. It was fun to see a couple of well-known actors of today in these two movies where they were quite young: Dennis Quaide and Helen Hunt.Recomended for anyone who enjoys old made-for-TV movies."
5,Very factual / well done,"The movie gave a real good feeling of accomplishment for the mentally impaired, and showed they can reach their goals in life. Everyone needs support of others, and to be treated with respect for their ideals."
2,Not that great,The recipes in this book are not what one would try on a regular basis. I would not recommend this book for purchase
3,Cookbook Using Twinkies Only,Do not buy this book if you want a receipe to actually make twinkies. Google online and get a couple verisons of the receipe. This book is full of receipes that are created using twinkies.
4,a thoughtful and inventive birthday gift,My girlfriend loves twinkies so I bought this sort of as a gag gift having NO idea the brownie (or should I say twinkie) points it would give. The recipe's in here are a phenomenal exercise in creativeness and fun! It's REALLY fantastic if you have kids. There are some very inventive things in there.With that said it seems that they could do even more (though being uncreative I don't know what) things and with more stuff but they just didn't have enough submitted or didn't think they were worthy of the book. I sure hope they come out with a Cookbook II because I'll sign up for it!
1,Avoid this one - I-Roy at his worst.,"This is one of those albums that Virgin put out where they had no idea what the hell they were doing (with the exception of their Gregory stuff)... they were just going for certain Jamaican ""names"" of the day (around 1976). The production has no feel and sounds like I-Roy wrote the lyrics and maybe put some thought into what he was saying but it didn't come across - it's disjointed, off time and he doesn't sound at one with the riddims. I suspect the vocals were probably recorded in London, on top of the imported Jamaican riddims hence, very difficult to duplicate the amazing feel of the best authentic Jamaican I-Roy hits. I can just imagine it now - I-Roy freezing his ass off in London :) I'd even suggest that Virgin mixed it in London too because again, it sounds too clean and correct - unlike the rougher Jamaican mixes. Give this one a miss."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this ski mask for my husband to wear on his way to work on his scooter. When it arrived I was very unhappy to see a sticker on it warning that it contains lead, which is known to cause reproductive and health issues, as well as birth defects.Are you kidding? It's a SKI MASK. Now my husband has to spend another week freezing his face off while we wait for a different ski mask to replace this one."
3,warm and thick material but.......,"Opened package which was sealed, and was happy with the fit, and its very warm on my bald head.:) But noticed a hole or tear on the side of the material, I deceide to sew it up,and it works fine, I diddnt want to go through the hassel of returning it. But for the price its a good quality cap, just needs to be inspected better before it ships."
5,Very Comfortable,"Use for blowing the snow off the driveway with a snowblower. Very comfortable, washable, easy to adjust to breath through nose or mouth. Long design so you can tuck in easily under your jacket. Great purchase and quality."
5,Freakin' Awesome!!!,"Wow, this thing is so sweet! I was just wandering around amazon looking for cool stuff that was cheap, and had almost given up when I found this! Success !!! *Victory Music* Anyway by way of information1.Extremely Warm2.Long(So you can tuck it into your shirt, or whatever)3.You look like a Ninja!!!(The reason I bought it)4.Very inexpensive5.Fast shipping(took 3 days){Not sure in all cases, but I figure since it's only one company it should be the same.--supersonicsixteen"
5,fanstastic,this album is exceptional; JE is a termendous song writer. Hard to find any music better then JE's - it's amazing how he is not so popular.
5,A book that can NEVER be put down untill the end!!!!!,"This book give's you an awesome insight on what it's like to deal with the stuggles of being differnt, or to what people think is ""normal"". I think if more people could express things like what are expressed in this book, we would be a lot happier."
3,All of the hype.....,"This is another book that was just ok, I didn't like how Leah dealt with her sister Gail, concerning Allen,..... I don't know when I'll read this one again.... ""Back to life"" by Wendy Coakley Thompson is still my favorite interracial romance so far."
5,A Colorblind Love,I thought this book related to my actual lifestyle so much. The character Leah Downey kind of knew from the beginning that there was something there between her character and Jason Horn and they sometimes they knew each others thoughts. This book shows the great struggle of young interaccial couples and how blind love should really be. The color of love shouldn't matter to anyone accept for you and the person that you are in love with. Thank you Sandra Kitt for such a wonderful book!
2,Harold,"Many a late night spent I, trying to crack this nut. Three days, I wept to the heavens. Three days! Verily I say, much easier it would be to slog through a mire. Three days of three pages each. Who can conceive such thoughts as be penned on these mighty leaves?""Nay!"", they cried, ""`tis poetry!"". ""Poetry"", I pondered in the silence of my heart. Prosody, perhaps, with flowering words entwined about playful constructs. Still the struggle raged on. But then with bitterness heavy upon my spirit, I lay the tome down with defeat. Rest, and maybe another day to take up the valiant attempt, but for now, tis not for the likes such as I."
4,A Major U-Turn For Buddy,"I disagree with the opinion that this is terrible. It's simply a radical departure from his old material. His usual soulful delivery is still intact, but this is a more commercial, pop sound. He's almost unrecognizable from the Hendrix years. It's well played and recorded - probably not for the rock fan."
5,An Indestructible Vessel,"An indispensible CD for lover's of Blues music, though as elsewhere noted, no Blues songs per se are in evidence. This is playing and singing like no other; extraordinary coaxing of bent notes from the bottleneck, a voice that seems to have been on the otherside and returned to intone all that's been witnessed. If bullfrog's spoke English! Wife, Angeline who he married just before these recordings, compliments his gravelly voice with her pure high pitch.Steve Calt pens a loving picture on the jacket noting the 'jarring contrast between the vividness of his musical landscape and the aridity of his intellectual horizon, as presented in his lyrics.'Which is to say, this is pretty much the work of a fundamentalist passion. Calt walks us through the technical prowess and variety displayed in the songs, then leaves off writing to let Johnson complete the experience."
3,"Skip this, get the box set","Let me just say this first: I love Fluke. However, I have a problem with Fluke's U.S. representaion on Astralwerks. This comp of their work is so unbelievably shallow, Astralwerks should be ashamed at having it in their catalogue. This disc is actually a cut-down compilation from a 3 cd compilation called ""Progressive History XXX"" that was released in Great Britain. You can probably guess which one is worth buying. The box set has a total of 32 songs on it, ranging from early ""Blighty"" and ""Peel Sessions"" works, to some tunes from ""6 Wheels"", ""Oto"", and ""Risotto"". The real gem on the 3 disc set is the disc of remixes...most have been unavailable for years. To be honest, I only gave this disc 3 stars because it has Fluke's name on it...seek out the import, and you will be rewarded."
3,Trip into genteel vaudeville,"Frank Crumit's slight voice doesn't stand up well to today's tastes, but he's got a slew of songs that, while not always funny-as-planned, give a glimpse into what was considered a laff-riot (OK, maybe richly humorous--or at least droll)back in the 1920s and 30s.Primarily of antiquarian value, but could be a good source of kitsch for someone looking for the occasional novelty tune."
5,Engineering An Empire,Great DVD just what I was after. Quality of the DVD was perfect and would recommend to others if they are interested in this subject.
4,The Takedown of Gomme,Interesting book. Entertaining. It would make a good Anime cartoon. I'm looking forward tio seeing more from this author.
3,Takedown of Gomme - Interesting,"I read an advance copy of this book quite a while ago. It's supprising that a publisher actually published the book. Alot of this seems like a homage to old cop shows and movies. This book will do one thing if not bore you, it WILL make you laugh. Sit down with a good cup of Coffee, and find out how these two cops finally takedown the Evil Gomme. Book II looks alot more exciting than Book I, here we go. D."
4,A classic.,"What else can be said, other than it should be required reading reading for all sci fi fans. A classic."
3,Thought this was a story book -- I was wrong,Just an FYI -- I must have missed the fact that this is a paperback book and not a storybook. I was looking for a toddler friendly book and this certainly isn't it. Love Paddington but this book is for older kids.
3,"Not English, Only Chinese","The information concerning the video was not explained in simple form that it was in a Chinese Langauge. All writing on the DVD was in English and my thinking was that it was also documented in English, I feel this should have been stated in a more distinct manner. Sorry, I was disappointed with this product, due to the language barrier not necessarily the content, as I have no understanding as to the information, however, would like to know!"
5,Everyday Gasket from a Quality Manufacturer,I've used gaskets from various manufacturers include Fel-Pro and I can say they make a good gasket. All rubber gaskets will fail at some point in their lifespan while in use and I do not have enough mileage on my vehicles to know which gasket is better. I can say that this set was complete and even took some effort for me to change the gasket ring around the spark plugs. Overall good quality and the head cover leak is no more.
2,Uhg...,The Omen series took a downward slope after the first one. This is the worst of the Omen films. Skip unless you must see it.
1,No need for that movie. Does not make sence.,"This movie was not demonic enough for an OMEN series.It was nothing like I expected,especially the music,which did not fall into the major scenes correctly. I really did not enjoy it."
1,This is not Omen!,"A cheap imitation of Omen series, even worse than Freddy's Nightmare 6th and others. You can get this idea before you watch the movie beacuse it's 90s production and based on a story of the daughter of Damien. It's very obvious that they have made this movie to use horror fans commercially but I don't think that it made good money during it was showed at cinemas."
1,One of the Worst Omen Films Ever!,Do not buy this because this is one of the worst films ever. I you are interested please go for the other ones instead of this one.
1,Why??,Ugh... Just ugh... Why they felt this TV movie was necessary after the storyline was all nice and wrapped up at the end of THE FINAL CONFLICT is beyond me. Almost as stupid as the idea of remaking the original. BOO! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
1,"Not a true sequel, but a failed TV spin off series pilot.","Don't be fooled by the title. Omen IV: The Awakening is not a true sequel to the cult classic theatrical trilogy at all. This made for television misfire is actually the failed pilot of a proposed Omen spin-off television series for the Fox Network that would have followed the growth of an all new Anti-Christ, the clone of the deceased Damien Thorn. A pathetic attempt to bottle another icy bolt of gothic terror that is just an embarrassing failure for all involved. Skip it."
5,Dragons of a Spring Dawning-Awesome Conclusion!!!,"I have read quite a few of Wies and Hickman's books and this one was by far the most intriging!! The last parts at Neraka still leave my shivering with delight. Tanis was one of my favorite characters in the whole series. He kept a cool head and stayed focus (until Kitiara showed up, but hey she tricked me too with her charming crooked smile!) Kitiara was one on the most intense and evil characters. She had her way with men which (I hate to say, I saw right through her)made her a very devious person. Wies and Hickman definately left the end of this book open for another series (That series is the Legend series made up of The Time of the Twins, The War of the Twins and the Test of the Twins) I think people everywhere should try this incredible series which left me spellbound for months. Even if you don't like fantasy i think you should give this a try. Hey, you really might enjoy it!!"
1,Do not order this item if you want Hardcover edition,"I tried to order the hardcover edition of this book three different times. Each time I tried buying it from different vendors and each time I received the paperback version. I inquired Amazon about it and they gave me some ridiculous excuses. Apparently they have an investigation team working on the problem, but I am not 'allowed' to know the outcome. If you want a mass market paperback just let me know...I now have three."
5,A great conclusion to a great trilogy,"I was fortunate enough to pick this trilogy up in its collector's edition, a couple of years ago. This was the first fantasy book I had ever read and is what hooked me on the genre.If you have not read this story, you must go out and get the book. Out of the three books there is no singular one that stands out above ther rest. I loved them all."
3,Questionable,"While I feel that Torey H. is sincere in her writing, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at some of the events in the story. As an educator for almost 30 years, I find Ms. Hayden's conduct to be questionable at times. For example, there are laws governing the confidentiality of students. I would not sit in my classroom and discuss an uncle's abuse of a student with other students. I would lose my job. In addition, leaving students alone for periods of time with an uncertified aide and a high school student is not a lawful practice in my state. In addition, swearing at a student is conduct for immediate disciplinary action. While I have no doubt to Ms. H's sincerity and work with her students, I would interested in what state permits such actions by a teacher."
3,Solid Book That Snapshops Authentic Teacher Struggles,"Not too bad.Not to mention it gives some rough and ready examples of just how difficult, and beautiful, this profession is.After reading her book, you will get just a peak at why teachers should get paid more than they do."
4,"The book was thought provoking, and very powerful.","The book shows a teacher that sees something in an abused, emotionally damaged 6 year old girl that will prove to be worthwhile. This literature also sheds light on the fact, people can make a tremendous difference in a person's life."
5,It is the best book ever written,"I think this is a great book, and that more people should read it because it is a true story. It really makes me think about how much children can handle, and much stronger Shelia is than most of us could ever be."
4,I want to know the movie about One Child!,I'm from Japan. I don't Know the Movie about it. Please tell me.
5,This book changed my life forevever,"As I read the first sentence,I was captured.I was breathless as I kept reading about Sheila.It was unbelievable the amount of pain this six year old girl went through.As I kept reading,I developed a new view on the world.I realized how fortunate I am.I was almost in tears by the end of the book.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes kids and wants to learn about the stuff going on that we have no idea of."
5,One Child in one sitting,I have just read Torey Hayden's One Child in one sitting. It is the most moving story I have ever read. Sheila's courage against so much adversity is simply breathtaking. I have to thank Torey for bringing this story to the world. Maybe it will give courage to others in a similar position to Sheila.
1,"Too hard to open, can't open them all the way","After reading all of the glowing reviews for these scissors, I was sold. I ordered them but I'm very disappointed in their functionality. They are very hard to open and close... you have to have really strong hands. Another issue is they are HUGE! I don't have small hands and I am unable to open them all the way with one hand. My fingers and thumb just don't spread far enough apart. One last thing... one tip is longer than the other. This might be nice if you are cutting in a straight line off the edge of the fabric but if you are trying to cut into a corner, you won't be able to cut to the edge. Very disappointing."
5,Beautiful And Meaningful,"This was a fascinating tale of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob and her other ""mothers"". Since she was the only daughter she was adored by the women. Her ""Aunties"" who were also Jacob's other wifes. She was also given the responsability of remembering the women's lives and the importance of women in Jewish society. I'm sure there was research done by Ms. Diamant not only to bring her characters to life but accuracy to make this story meaningful to the reader. It made me realize how we are becoming a people in this country without rituals and everyday civilities that make life rewarding. We are losing what makes life worth living: our interconnectedness with each other and the universe. I have heard complaints that this didn't really happen. No, of course not, this is a novel. Bibical literalists will not enjoy this narrative."
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding!,I found the book The Red Tent to be boring beyond belief. I had been told it was interesting from a biblical history veiwpoint and was disappointed with the treatment Anita gave the history of that time. Her telling of the story of Jacob was lose enough I found myself wondering if this was the Jacob I thought I knew from the Bible. I simply wasn't sure I was thinking of the same man she was writing about.I did not intend to read a book that had as its' main focus the monthly cycle of women. I found it simply boring. This is not a subject conducive to excellant fiction!
1,A disappointment,"Having read other excellent nonfiction works by Anita Diamant, I looked forward to this novel. Unfortunately, I found The Red Tent to be filled with cardboard characters many of whom appeared to have escaped from various romance novels. The male characters in particular were two-dimensional. It's one thing to dymythologize biblical heroes but shrinking them to cartoon size is overdoing it."
1,Beautiful? No. Revolting? Yes.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. The back cover made it sound like a wonderful tale with an interesting perspective. Well, what it really was, was continuous tales of sex, sex with other species, incest, etc. I found it repulsive. I cannot find that beautiful or inspiring. I felt like I was reading a kinky porn set in Biblical times.I'm not against sex in books, but this? This was ridiculous.Sorry, I know that some people loved it... I just can't understand why."
3,Not very entertaining,"But it is an enriching read that brings to life the ancient ways in which women's ""nature"" was dealt with in primitive society."
3,Good writing bad story,"As a person who has studied the bible for fifteen out of the nineteen years of my life I am slightly disappointed in the author. Her writing is superb and I didn't want to put down the book. However, since most people don't know many of the details of Dinah's story and the lives of jacob and his wives people will get the wrong impression. It is so far from the story in the bible. The book made it seem as though Jacob and Rebecca were two egomaniacal psycopaths who were the only ones on the planet to believe in a single G-d. I thought it portrayed the biblical family in a very disrespectful manner. Even if you don't believe that the bible is accurate Ms. Diamant went a little too far. I comend her though on her writing. Maybe she should have just gone the whole nine yards and use completely fictional characters."
2,Extremely disappointed - highly inaccurate,"I picked up this book because I love reading stories about lesser known people in the Bible. I was disappointed when I finished this book. I was expecting a biblically accurate novel, instead I got what I believe to be a feminist, anti-Bible account. For example, Dinah was portrayed by the author as a woman who had premarital sex. In the Bible she was raped. In the book she was portrayed as more ""enlightened"" than her relatives when she chose a goddess over God. If you appreciate accuracy, then you will dislike this book. If accuracy doesn't bother you, then you will probably like this book. One thing this book teaches you (maybe the only thing) is that you must *always* check the facts."
3,Advertised as new but name of previous owner written inside.,"I was disappointed to find that this book was advertised as new but is not new. The name of a previous owner is written on the flyleaf and the edges of the pages are yellowed. Since the book was for myself, I kept it and read it. I would have returned it if I had bought it as a gift. Buyer beware!"
3,A different life,"I found the story hard to follow in the beginning, but I was drawn in more and more by the view of a woman's life in the past. It was engrossing."
4,Entertaining Fictional Reading about Dinah,Great reading but not biblically accurate. The reader must remember that this is a work of fiction based on the Biblical account of Dinah and all that is not said in relation to that account. Very well imagined and gripping.
5,Well written,Based on Biblical facts this story kept the reader interested as it revolved around the life and times of several characters. Dianna was a very believable person who we could relate to even in this day and age.
3,"Good, but ...","I decided to read ""The Red Tent"" because I was so impressed by ""The Last Days of Dogtown"" and because I am fascinated by the stories in Genesis. Two things disappointed me in this excellent and intriguing novel: the many important discrepancies with events as recorded in Genesis, and the scant influence that Jacob and his worship of Jehovah had upon the women in his family. For contrast, one might read Orson Scott Card's ""Women of Genesis"" series."
5,Wonderful woman's story,"This was a great read! I could not put it down The stories in the Bible are somewhat thin, here the auther fleshes them out and takes you back in time."
5,"Stunning fiction, impressive history.","This work was a delight, and really brought the concept of life in ancient times alive in a rare and compelling manner. I loved the way the main character evolves; how the PR that's been reported about her life didn't match true events; and the sheer humanity of her generation and their lifestyle. I thought this book brought genuine insight into the teachings of the Bible, and wish there were more like it."
3,highs and lows,Anita Diamant is a very talented writer who draws you into her story with her emotional highs and lows. Throughout the book I felt that each woman should have a story to tell and leave it in such a poetic way. I appreciated the respectful place she gave to woman and mothers.This is of course HER story. There are more contradictions than parrellels with the original Biblical story. In order to really enjoy it I had to remind myself that this was her story throughout the book. I think she should have followed the Biblical account more closely or written her story without using the biblical characters and names.I wished that the author would have left us with more hope.A sad ending from my viewpoint.
3,Red`Tent,This book was purchased for a library reading group. I thought the book was OK but I do not think it is appropriate for a mixed group discussion.
4,Great for new mothers,"As a new mother, I felt this book pulled at my heart strings - following a girls journey from childhood into womanhood and then to motherhood. You learn to love Dinah early in the story and wish she would never grow up - but she must stand the trials of her mothers before her and learn her place in the universe as a mother, daughter, wife, and sister. Don't listen to people complaining about the lack of biblical accuracy - that's why it is called ""BIBLICAL FICTION"" and the Bible is mostly fiction anyway so I don't know what the big deal is. I initially thought it would be very religious, but there is no propaganda in it. I am not Jewish or Christian, but I found the story captivating and finished in just a couple of days because I couldn't put it down."
1,A slap in the face ...,"It took me forever to get through this book. Why? I hated it. If it weren't on my reading group list I wouldn't even have finnished it. It wasn't the writting style or the topic (I love biblical historical fiction/nonfiction). I hated how Anita Diamant took the lives of these characters and portrayed them as complete hethens. She took a basic story found in the bible and exploited it, changing biblical fact to get her own agenda across and in the process making this book a slap in the face to every christian and jew that reads it. How sad. Don't waste your money on this book!"
2,Definitely NOT a Biblical account,"What I found actually disturbing was how the author twisted the facts of the Bible. I would encourage you to read Genesis 25 through the end of that book to learn the true story. It is obvious that she took great pains to rewrite history or else that she does not believe the Bible to be truth.What is most frustrating to me, is that she uses SOME truth and then twists other truths into blatant lies. Just to give one example, Joseph did NOT succumb to the temptations of Potiphar's wife and did NOT sleep with her. In the facts that the writer has twisted, she denies the power of God in the entire lineage of Jacob.She sums up her theme in the last couple of pages when she writes, ""there is no magic in immortality"". Well, there may not be magic in it, but what she is really saying is that immortality has nothing to do with God, which is a lie."
1,Not worth reading,"Although this book has been highly touted, it was definitely not worth reading. The story is boring, sugary and poorly written. The story line (was there one?) was poorly constructed. I understand what the author was trying to do (write a story from the womemn's perspective) but while trying to fill in the blanks of the biblical story, she drew a blank herself."
1,Neo-paganism inserted into an Old Testament Story,"Not a surprise that one reviewer compared this book to ""Mists of Avalon"" -- both books insert contemporary neo-pagan beliefs and sensabilities into stories set in earlier times, and both books delight advocates of women-centric neo-pagan spirituality.Diamant is a skilled writer, but don't expect upon picking up this book that you will be reading either a biblically or historically accurate account of the times."
2,Pagan dribble,"I bought this book thinking it would give me some insight into the lives of the women in the bible but was very disappointed as it focused too much on the idols and pagan ways of the women and wives of Jacob.It wasn't even scripturally sound .If you write a book based on truth then get your facts straight !The life of Jacob was centered on the God of Abraham and Isaac, the one and only true God but Diamant portrayed him as a pagan who compromised his faith for the love of women.In the true account of Jacob and his family's story his children would have been influenced by their father's faith.What a load of rubbish, I was looking forward to the historical accounts of eastern women in that time.There is nothing worse than reading historical novels which belie the truth and destroy and discredit actual characters."
1,The Red Tent Beware Full of Bible untruths,I was extremely dissapointed with this book. It could have been great except for the unbeleivable amounts of untruths and downright lies concerning Biblical truth. They were totally unneccessary. The author took it upon herself to rewrite scripture. Very dangerous! The book could have been plenty interesting without them. Dont believe everything she writes as gospel because it is NOT. Also there are some very gruesome chapters that if true would be history but instead are only fictional. Too many people unknowingly think this book is biblical fact when it isnt at all.
2,A good story but disappointing,"This story was interesting in it's historical value, but I was expecting the story to at least mention God. This was Jacob's family - Joseph, Ben, Judah, etc. God is never mentioned in this book.This book is just a story, one that will hold your interest, but it is not inspirational, scriptural, or spiritual.If you read it, just read it for a story. That's all."
1,Not what I expected,"I picked up this book, expecting one thing and getting another. As a result, I hated this book. If you're looking for a Christian religious fiction book (as advertised) you're going to be disappointed. This book does take a Bible story but then winds up really being a book that focuses on ""woman-power"" and has more of a goddess cult feel than anything. The women in this book are strong, caring, intelligent, spiritual and practically infalliable. By contrast, the men are mostly manipulative, deceitful, brutal, cowardly and cruel. If I'd wanted this kind of propaganda, I'd have read Gloria Steinham. If you are looking for a good religious fiction book, read The Robe or Quo Vadis. If you're just looking to read a bestseller, and have no other expectations, than go ahead and read The Red Tent."
1,Red Tent Bleeds with distortions,"I thought this was one of the worst books ever written. It has so much historical distortions that fit neatly into a radical feministic viewpoint of the biblical times. This book demonizes males of the biblical times. Furthermore, it takes the central character and tries to make us believe that a girl who is barely into puberty can have a deep romantic sexual experience and fall deeply in love with an adolescent male after just meeting him. The entire book is contrived. Furthermore, it is an insult and affront to the Old Testament."
5,Archaeological evidence,"Excellent portrayal of the period. Having worked on archaeological sites in Israel for several years, I have been associated with sites where evidence of 'pagen' objects are commonly found right along side of objects associated with judaism...in the same households. This indicates that there was simultaneous worship of idols and ""El"" contrary to what one reviewer might think. I have also worked on sites rich in matriarchal 'goddess' evidence from pre-hebrew periods. The author did an excellent job of filling in the blanks left by the biblical tale and archaeological evidence. Good book!"
4,I Am Woman! (BC Style),"Diamant's ""Red Tent"" is a piece a well-crafted historical fiction based upon the Biblical tale of the only surviving daughter of Exodus' most fertile patriach and polygamist, Jacob. The story of Dinah is little more than a footnote in the Good Book, but here Diamant has fleshed out Dinah's story and the stories of her four mothers Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah as well as her many brothers including Jospeh (of Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat fame). The author has given real faces and believable family conflicts to a well-known Old Testament story. This story spans Dinah's life from before she was born to her death and richly details the mystical powers of womanhood. Dinah travels through the Holy Land, to Egypt, becomes a wife, mother, midwife, daughter, widow, and healer. . Those of you who enjoyed the ""Mists of Avalon"" will like the similar epic quailty and message of the book."
3,Mixed Feelings,"It was an easy read for most of it, but got slow at the end when they went to Egypt. I enjoyed keeping up with the story of Jacob and Laban and referred to the Bible to examine the differences. I did get tired of the constant references to bleeding as reviewer Marguerite Salen stated. Maybe I am off base there. For the most part this was a book written by a woman for women."
4,Lovely story!,"I often take books from my mother's book shelf. She's an avid reader and has superb taste in books. I over looked this book on her shelf for years. It just didn't seem to be my kind of book. I was finally talked into giving it a try and boy am I glad! This book is beautiful! You have to pay some attention to all the names. It's not the easiest read I've ever had, but it's not the hardest either, and well worth it! There is a family tree of all the names you need to know in the front of the book so don't let that keep you from reading this wonderful book. I highly recommend it!"
5,One of the BEST books I have ever read!,"A friend read this book, and suggested that I read it. I found it very well written and very interesting. I liked hearing about all the familiar characters throughout the book, but I especially liked how the author made the story more of a love story. Not just the love between husband and wife, but the love of a mother and daughter. I have always been curious as to what happened to Dinah, the only daughter of Leah, and this story (though false) is better than I ever could have imagined it."
4,"""The Red Tent"" -- exceptional writing, some scenes a bit gruesome.","I am reading this as part of a study group of Jewish and Christian women. We are having a wonderful time examining various viewpoints and imagining how it might have been from the women's point of view, thanks to the excellent writing of Anita Diamant. An intriguing novel and a good read. Be prepared for some graphic scenes of childbirth, murder, abuse, but also a fascinating picture of life at a blooming time in the world of Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and Esau, told through a daughter of one of the several wives of Jacob. I meant to read this sooner and I see this is the book's 10th anniversary. Better late than never. As a Christian, I think we see Biblical history through a certain lens. For instance, it's easy to forget that there was still strong belief in multiple gods during this period. A very worthwhile and rich reading experience."
5,"The Red Tent, Tenth Anniversary Edition","This is informative, powerful, interesting, and riveting. I could not put it down. I will read it over again. I think every student of history, religion, or psychology should read it. It was recommended to me, and I will recommend it to many in my family. I won't lend it. It will stay on my library shelf for reference and future read-overs."
3,An Interesting Read but Not That Enthralling,"I wanted to love this book, but I can honestly say that I only ""liked"" it. An interesting concept, well-written in general, but I personally didn't find it that compelling. I understand that it has been lauded as a must-read for women. I may read it again because I'm wondering what all the fuss is about - maybe I missed something???"
1,Practically sacrilegious,"Having a fascination with the historical culture of the Biblical lands and people, and a great respect for the characters in the Bible, I really looked forward to reading this book. I was disappointed and even occasionally horrified to see the author's treatment of these characters. What surprised me was that I would have expected her to have treated these people--her spiritual forefathers--with the reverence they deserve. (Do we really need to hear about Jacob's wedding nights?)I threw my copy away."
2,Disappointed,"After years of hearing about this book, I had great anticipation of literature at its finest. While the story is compelling, it is written like a romance novel. If you are expecting great spiritual insight with little physical indulgence, you will be disappointed. It has little spiritual insight, and a lot of ""earthiness."""
5,A Real Page-Turner!,"I was kind of turned off on the concept of the book before I actually started reading it. I thought being a biblical fictionalized story it might be preachy and force the author's values onto the reader. Boy was I wrong. This is a class-A, top notch story told with such deep character development that it was so easy to picture what life was like in the Genesis-times and to picture each of the many characters. I laughed, I cried, I got angry...this book takes you through so many wonderful powerful emotions.I could not put this book down and I am so glad that I read it. We read it in our book club and it was unanimous that it is an excellent novel. I highly recommend it for every female out there who likes to read. You will not be disappointed in the slightest."
2,A Refreshing Take on an Old Story,"I liked the point of view of this book, and the very rich description, but did not find it so compelling that I couldn't put it down. I was less concerned with what would happen than with the narrator's perspective. I liked the lesser (female) characters of these age-old tales being given center stage, and look forward to Diamant's next book."
2,Great style but ......,"Diamant paints an elaborate word picture of the world of the patriarchs. Many of her characters are simultaneously captivating and sympathetic. Nonetheless, anyone remotely familiar with the Genesis text can't help but compare the two and find Diamant's story lacking. What makes other historical/biblical works of fiction successful is the writer's ability to transport imaginary characters into an historically accurate setting. Diamant places her imaginary characters into a psuedo biblical setting that completely conflicts with the Genesis text. Hers is a whimpy, whiny Joseph whose rise to power can only be described as serendipitous. Gone is the beauty of forgiveness, ""What you meant for evil, God meant for good."" In its place we are given an old man suffering from Alzheimer's and a son who can't get away quick enough. A story about the life and world of the otherwise little known Dinah was indeed a compelling idea. Too bad, Diamant fell short in her delivery."
4,This book was excellent and very informative,"I enjoyed this book very much. The very essence of the 'red tent' was something new to me. Apparently the women spent time in the red tent during menstruation and childbirth.There were a few things that I did not understand ie: why did the brothers attack and kill all the men in the village and their sisters' husband, even though they all agreed to have all men circumcised. I found this portion disturbing and confusing. Jacob seemed like such an honest man and he kept his word. Is it possible that he did not know of the attack?-doubtfulAside from a couple of areas which I found hard to understand, the book was great.In particular, I liked how Dinah told the story through her own eyes, in her own words.Very enjoyable."
3,Not as good as I expected,I was told this is an excellent book but did not find it to be that great. The second half was more interesting than the first half. I think what I liked least about it was the author's writing style. To me it seemed plain and boring. I have read so many books that I could not put down but this was not one of them. It was not a bad book - I was able to finish it with no problem - but it certainly was not great in my opinion.
3,"Women Only, Please","Not surprisingly, the male characters in this novel are woefully underdeveloped leaving the reader with a rather lopsided story. I longed to know more about what motivated Jacob, but never got more than a one-dimensional look at him. And his God...barely even gets a mention...rather surprsing given the source material the author was using. Nevertheless, I found this an interesting read that certainly gave me a whole new perspective on the culture and mores of the women in the Bible."
5,What Can I Say?,"I read some of the other reviews and I think there is no reason why this book should be loathed by so many! I think the way the story was told is wonderful and although there were some Paganistic tendencies we must remember that this IS a work of FICTION! Its not completely true to the bible story, which I personally think made it a lot better, and how can you expect it to be so? If you would like a book that holds your interest well, this one's great! I loved it!"
5,Fascinating Book,"This book is a reminder to every woman, the difficulties we have overcome and the strength we all have.This book was inspiring, sad, thrilling,and brought me both to tears and laughter.I could not put this book down once I got it."
3,I liked it the first time....,"The first time that I read this book, right after it was published I enjoyed it, now that I have read it again, having read other works of historical/biblical fiction I'm not sure why. As a work of fiction it is well written, and I would recommend it but, there are other works that portray the story of Jacob and his family with more accuracy."
1,Christians Beware!!!!,"I wanted to read this book when I found it on favorite books lists of those who I have a lot in common. I was shocked in the first chapter how ""off base"" the author is. I understand that this is a work of fiction. But I take offense when the basis for the fictional story is the Bible and the fictional story is so vulgar. I understand that the people mentioned in the Bible did not lead perfect lives. Please do not make a mockery of the sacredness of the Bible. If you wnat to read some quality Biblical fiction check out Francine Rivers' books on Tamar, Ruth, etc."
3,An intriguing premise for a novel,"The premise of this book is fascinating. Dinah is a footnote in the bible to the more ""important"" story of Jacob and his twelve sons, the fathers of the tribes of Israel. The book wonderfully evokes the interaction between ancient men and women, different religions and cultures and the world of the red tent. I wished the world of the red tent still existed, I could do with several days every month to laze on pillows and listen to the stories of my mother and other relatives!!I learned a great deal and was intrigued by Dinah and saddened by her story. This book most emphatically is NOT a bible story. God hardly comes into it.I thought the book lost its way towards the end but this does not undermine the enjoyment of the reader in exploring this forgotten world. I, too, finished the novel quickly and this is a sure sign of an engaging and enjoyable read."
3,was just OK,"Not crazy with all of the author's liberties she took with the biblical ""heros"". I really enjoyed Orson Scott Card's series on the Old Testament women better- although he takes his share of liberties as well, but at least they are more respectful."
1,Inaccurate and crude.,"I wish I read more reviews before I bought this book.I didn't read it all because after a while it just put me off completely.I was expecting a book like Redeeming Love but this book is anything but...The author invents things like Jacob worked seven months, instead of seven years, and their actions are anything but Christian like, such as having sex with animals... And constant bad mouthing of characters.I don't think I ever disliked a book as much as I do this one..This book left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel sick ..."
5,A MUST READ BOOK,This is an outstanding book. I could not put it down. I have E-mailed The Oprah Show and suggested that Oprah add it to her Book Club. The book was riveting. I am a teacher and the book was reccommended to me by my school's librarian. You must read this book.
5,Amazing Journey Into History,"When I started the book, I thought it might be a lot of history with confusing character names to remember. Once I was two to three pages into the story, I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've ever read. After I finished, I picked up the Bible and was amazed that some events were spoken about. A truly talented author to shed light on the shadows of such a well known story - completely believable."
4,A Life Untold,"Anita Diamant has crafted a captivating read in this tale of Dinah, daughter of Jacob. Genesis 34 recalls only the tiniest thread of Dinah's existence. Diamant has, with a seer's vision and an abundant well of imagination, woven a elaborate, integral tapestry from that thread. _The Red Tent_ is an accounting not only of Dinah's birth, life, and death, but also a vivid recollection of the proud people whence she originated."
3,Sleep Outside in The Red Tent,"Anita Diamant gives us a story from the bible through her eyes. The Red Tent is an amazing story about John and his five wives. At the beginning of the story, a conflict immediately starts, whether or not Rachel should get married. With a conflict this early in the story, you know this has to be a great read. I think The Red Tent is an awesome story that everybody can learn from. Some situations in this book may make you laugh and some may make you cry. If you need some inspiration in your life, I suggest you read this book. I give this book a 3 on the rating scale. I give it a 3 because I think some of the situations are a little too descriptive and the story could have a little more suspense."
2,Not good for the bible believing christian,"It was an interesting story and very well written. And it certainly was historical FICTION....i think the only thing historical about it was the fact that they used biblical names and places. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had pre marital sex. I think that alone is an injustice to the real Dinah, to be raped and then have the idea put into the minds of those who read the book that she might have consented. how horrible!! I had to go back and re read the actual account from the bible and while reading the book had to keep reminding myself that it was total make believe, because boy! does it get your feeling stirring!! For the bible believing christian this is a dangerous book to read. For those who aren't, I believe this would be an excelent read."
4,That is a long hall!,"Not unlike Meshuggah's I, Halls of Amenti is a 19min journey through a doomy music wonderland that makes you reassess what you think of one of your favourite metal bands. Cephalic Carnage just add another feather to their cap."
4,A scientic approach on reincarnation based on case reports,"Dr Ian Stevenson had reported several cases of reincarnation-type. His experience represents the best scientific evidence suggesting reincarnation as a natural fact. This book is a summary of the best examples, presented in a small brochure, focusing on an intriguing aspect: beyond memories of a previous life, reported by some children (usually between one and five year-old), some of them present birthmarks in their skin, or congenital organ damages, that are related to injuries suffered in the previous life. Some case reports reveal impressive concordance of children birthmarks and autopsy reports of the supposed previous incarnation. Could it occurr only by chance? Or this evidence represents a scientific basis for reincarnation beliefs?"
3,Hard time cutting thread,"Two big disappointments. One, it is very hard to cut thread with these snips. Two, on Amazon it stated they were made in the USA. Once I got them, the package said made in China. Would not by them again."
1,Evil Offspring,The Redheaded girl is very HOT. Story line is confusing. The charactors are not believable. Takes place somewhere in Michigan and I like that. Silly Flick. This is a film that probably nobody has heard about and would be better off not hearing about it.
5,"Eugene,Eugene, this movie is the best!","Thats right, this is by far the best period piece I have ever seen. With dark and brooding characters, lovely scenery and things that are not what they seem, this was truly a wonderful viewing experience.BBC, make more movies like this.Enjoy!"
5,"A dense, literate, gorgeous production.","Having watched the PBS production of this film, I was very pleased with it's quality, which showed in every frame and each detail. The actors were each alternately fiery and subtle, the location filming was exquisite, and the small touches, like the change in color--one moment drab browns and greys showing the wretched dust (garbage) bins and the denziens, then quick cut to brilliant reds, yellows and golds when portraying the 'upper' classes at their gossipy parties. The script also deftly handled the many characters and plot threads, that are a hallmark with Charles Dickens's work, with ease and clarity. EVERY literary adaption (and movies in general) should be treated with this much intelligence and care. Highly recommended"
2,"Sorry, didn't get to view; bad dvd","I have heard this movie was great and I love the classics; however, the package had been ripped open before it arrived and the carrier had to retape it. The dvd package looked fine, but the dvd would not play at all. Maybe next time."
4,Our Mutual friend,"I purchased this just because it looked fun to watch. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. It starts off a bit hard to understand, so be patient! After the first part, it all starts to come together a bit more and hooks you. The accents are sometimes so strong, I had a hard time understanding what they are saying. But it is a very good movie and you come to love the characters. I definitely recommend purchasing the movie."
2,Our Mutual Snore,"Boring, boring, boring.... SLOWWWWWWWW. plodding, confusing script, mediocre acting.... dark, depressing.... If you have a weekend you want to wast and it's raining & your dog died and momma is still in prison and the fridge is empty and the roaches won't go away - go for it.... I am donating my copy to the library."
3,A BIT PREACHY BUT STILL INTERESTING,"I enjoy hearing and appreciate the wisdom of nanas and grandmas around the globe. Life experience makes you a master of life and everyone benefits from insight.Grandma Ollie, the voice of wisdom and caution throughout this tale, offers an abundance of such. This is where Ms.Joe begins to lose me. Too many cliches too many tales makes me a bored listener.The story itself is told in a relatively coherent, flashback style, which kept me alert and engaged, but some of the ""lessons"" were a bit abundant. Nice effort."
3,"Big basket, little substance","This is one of about 8 baskets I ordered, but although it is the biggest one by far, it is filled with huge cracker boxes that just take up space. It looks impressive though, and would make an appropriate gift for business partners."
5,Great grip and size,"Finally and American made product. And really good ones too! Got mine from Amazon with free shipping....you've got to like that. The pliers work very well and with the offset head can get into unusual and smaller spaces than you might think. I am very happy with these functional, durable tools."
2,Not worth the $$ unless your a Bruce Lee fan!,"Well, after ordering and watching this movie, i thought well, this wasn't really that great. There are some Bruce Lee clips and stuff but i thought why would the yshow fake Bruce Lee episodes?..i mean...i'm not paying to watch that stuff. I felt that was just simply a waste of film cuz the martial arts was pretty bad as well...anyhow, i guess if your a bruce lee fan like me, you would order it otherwise, don't buy it!"
3,Nice to see organic products for teething,I like this toy and am thrilled to offer my baby something safe to put in her mouth the only problem is that she has no interest in putting it her mouth!! So we are taking cotton wash clothes wetting them and then freezing them. She absolutely loves to chew on that!! Go figure. But she does like to play with it especially the little strings attached to the head.Michelleeditor http://healthy-holistic-living.com
4,great for someone in a small space,"The best thing is that it folds flat and can be kept in any room for touch ups. The iron bay at the end stores underneath for space conservation when not in use, but when in use it creates a safe and stable place for that ever-so-hot iron. I consider that option as an excellent safety feature. Extra padding would be good, and I do add padding to all of my boards. It makes ironing a nicer experience and eliminates the possibility of getting a ""waffle"" pattern pressed into your garment. This tabletop model is well worth the money, which was a real bargain, in my opinion."
3,5 Stars for the board 1 Star for shipping,"You would not believe how big the box was that this came in, how can anybody waste like this, come on amazon, get a grip on the waste, I bet I could put25 of these in the box, you gotta find a better way, and it seems that it would save someone some money.5 stars for the ironing board, its just right."
2,Very disappointed!,"This board is crap! I didn't expect all that much for the money it cost, but it has shortcomings that make it unusable! First it came missing one of the rubber feet of two that keep it from sliding off of you table surface and also protecting it from being scratched. I tried to call customer service at all possible times of the day and always get forwarded to a voicemail box that is full. The board itself is not flat. Where the unsupported section is, it is warped down. Also--it didn't occur to me while purchasing it, but you can't hang pants, shirts, etc. over while ironing naturally because they will rest on whatever your surface may be (bed, table, etc.). So the shirt/pants get bunched up and causes wrinkles rather than hanging freely. It only gets the two stars because of the cheap price, small footprint, and easy hidability while not in use."
3,good for the price,"Not a great board. But you get what you pay for. No complaints in specific, but it could have been better."
4,Romance and Intrigue,"This story, set at Brittain's entrance into WWII is a great Romance novel with a solid dose of Intrigue. The story follows several intertwined plot lines that are well linked. The plot takes a few twists and turns along the way, and includes a couple steamy scenes. This is the third Follett novel I have read (Lie Down with Lions, and Whiteout). I would rank it ahead of Whiteout but behind Lie Down with Lions."
1,Tiny Bubbles....,"I read this book right after reading ""Pillars of the Earth."" That might have been a mistake. I thought PotE was a great book. I thought Night Over Water was just awful. Trite, poor characterizations, uninspired. I can't believe others raved about it. I can't believe it's by the same author as Pillars, Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, etc. I have read Pillars several times and feel it is a great read. I gave Night Over Water away right after I read it. Read at your own literary peril."
2,"Like Adams, but not one of my favorite except for one song","OK, the song of Robin Hood is the song of our marriage, so have to like it, but have liked other Adams offerings more though many find some great tunes."
3,"""Waking Up The Neighbors"" Stirs A New Adams Sound","I have had this album for awhile and truthfully, I had not sat down and listened to every track on it thoroughly. Recently, I was on a trip and popped it into the car and played all of it, so I thought I would review it. This album is very long, some tracks are repetitive, yet some are very rocking. Brilliant guitar work and vocal stylings (ala Mutt Lange) and heavy Def Leppard-like drumming. Adams does not sound like he used to on some of his earlier albums (""Reckless"", ""Cuts Like A Knife"", ""Into The Fire""), definitely from the influence of Mutt Lange. I was also listening to another one of Lange's products, Shania Twain's ""Come On Over"", and if you listen very closely, the chord structure of each song is EXACTLY the same as on ""Neighbors"", the differences are just a hint of country flair and of course, Shania's seductive vocals. All in all, ""Waking Up The Neighbors"" was a little disappointing for me."
5,A Worthwhile Product,"I, too, was initially put off by the price of this product. I got it on a cruise ship in a spa and I guess I was feeling indulgent. But it has really helped. I've lived most of my life in Hawaii and nothing is going to completely obliterate the sun damage, but I think this product is worth the cost. Best part--you only need to use a very small amount. This tube has lasted me about 2 years!"
3,something missing.......,"A thoroughly enjoyable read. However, I found the argumentation was from a very Catholic perspective, despite the author's conviction that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married. What I mean is that Margaret Starbird does not question the virgin birth doctrine or the ""divinity"" of Jesus, and accepts the theological view that Jesus came to die for our sins. All these things are contradicted by the idea that he came to be a husband and make a family. Put bluntly, only a psychopath marries one day and commits suicide the next. A rational understanding of Jesus is long overdue, one that incorporates the idea that he was a real man with real physical and emotional needs, but also that his premature death was a disaster for mankind - as history proves on a daily basis. But we don't get that here. So while I recommend this book, and think it is a step in the right direction - it is nevertheless a baby step."
2,"Just not to my tastes, but read the other reviews here...","I'm not a big fan of Joe or of ""world music"" but I listened to this because a friend lent it to me. It is certainly competently done, but for listeners perhaps more sophisticated than I am."
4,surprisingly...good,"one of Mary Kirchoff's ""better"" works. Not being much of a Burrfoot fan , and after having to read a very disappointing ""Kendermore"" ; I wasn't expecting much when i began reading the book. Ending it didn't prove to be hard too. The plot was well enough written (Mary finally veers off from being a Weis/Hickman clone) . The characters , or should i say ; sub characters to the overall DL saga , were easy to process. The half elf , hill dwarf and kender characterisation remained faithful to the original Weis/Hickman. Not a lot of discrepancies to ""Kindred Spirits"" not to make it an indirect tie in. All in all ""Wanderlust"" wasn't bad . Wasn't bad at all."
4,"Great value, decent performance","It works well, the only issue I've had is that every time I try to go onto the internet, I have to repair the network connection. Once this is done, it works like it should. I don't know why this is because I followed the instructions to the letter, but it very well could be a setting I need to change."
4,Making Russian Lit Cool,"A book which has made the journeyed the generation gap into the arms of popular culture which, of course, has always had a subversive side to it. Indeed the main character of Notes.. is himself isolated from society and makes no attempt to cure the problem. You really feel you can get to know Dostoyevsky through this book, it is this vital quality, the up-front nature, which makes it so readable. It really is a good book to study if you're doing literature at uni and if not pick it up any way and see what it takes to be a writer in communist Russia."
4,Great Intro to Dostoyevsky,"For those readers who are interested in Dostoyevsky but aren't willing to commit to one of his more verbose works, this is a good one to try. The plot is classic Dostoyevsky but tends to read a bit easier. As with all of his works, be prepared to reflex on what you've read and even read certain passages repeatedly."
1,Save your money and your time,"Wow, this was so bad, it was painful to watch. Maybe I'm spoiled by the quality of the rebooted Doctor Who, but this seemed terrible in every possible way. Awkward writing, abysmal acting, dated and silly effects, uneven style, and plot holes you could fly the Tardis through, made this feel like a very slap-dash attempt at something that could have been SO MUCH better. An example of the ridiculousness: The doctor's two hearts on an x-ray are explained away as ""a double exposure"". Multiple times. Really??? Say, does anyone here in this HOSPITAL have a stethoscope? No? Oh, ok, nevermind.Obviously your mileage may vary, but I would recommend saving your money & time (I'm lucky I got this from the library, so at least I didn't waste any money on it), and skip over this to go directly to the 2005 Doctor Who series."
4,Doctor Who,"Ah yes, a far to short lived the incarnation of the Doctor! This is a American movie made version of the Doctor but Perfecty done, an nice nod to the Tom Baker's look but still modern. This version of the Tardus IS Spectacular wish they kept it!! This adventure of the 8th Doctor acted by Paul McGann, gives more into the background of who the doctor is, very cool movie and his adventures apparently continue as Audio CDs you may wish to look into!"
3,The hat serves the purpose,"I don't really care for this hat but it serves the purpose of keeping the sun off my head and face. It doesn't look as good as the picture, the brim is rolled and I can't get it to stay flat after ironing multiple times."
3,Not American Made,"The process of purchasing and shipping was very good. I was disappointed that this boonie hat which I purchased that is warn by American military personnel was made in China. The ""Made In China"" cheapened the military history of the hat. It is comparable to purchasing an American flag made in china. You just don't do it."
3,Rothco Sizing Issue,"The material the hat is made of is good and should give years of service as long as it is not abused excessively.The fit is where the hat fails for me. I ordered a 7-3/4 size, the hat arrived in this size, this is the size I order all my hats in, however this one seems to actually be the next size down, it fits way too tight to the point that after five minutes I can feel pain radiating through my skull to the point I feel a headache coming on, I remove the hat and the pain ebs away to nothing in ten minutes.The other Boonie hats I've owned have all been 7-3/4 size and fit perfectly, those hats were made by Propper. My hat size is an eight.I own other clothing products from Rothco and am happy with them but this is one fails for me.Perhaps the hat has the wrong label on it...????I would try to return it but instead I am going to ask my friends if they would like to have it as a gift."
1,Didn't like it at all...,"Not that I think things should be dumbed down or anything, but this book was too complicated! It made simple things more difficult than they actually are. I never read this book and still got an A in Statistics. Instead of reading this, I just went over each problem once with a friend or tutor.If this book is required, I guess you are stuck and have to get it, otherwise, don't buy it!"
5,Go game,"I purchased a Go game as a requested gift for my son. The range of choices made the decision of which board to buy difficult. In the end, I sent links to him and let him choose. A plus for this board is that it includes two game board sizes - one on the front and one on the back. Apparently, the smaller grid on one side produces a simpler game. After reading reviews, I was cognizant of the quality of the board. I checked the board carefully and did not notice any problems. I am pleased with the choice."
2,Annabelles Wish,THis is not the full version of the movie. there is a part of the movie missing. Disappointed. I had the original on vhs and I watched it many times with my children.
1,STILL WAITING.......,"Ordered way back in December and was promised by January 4, well as we can see it has come and gone and still no movie....that was giving them 14 days to ship it...no communication unless I get in contact with them. They send me something to read about tracking, but still no movie. Am never going to buy from them again and if do not receive in the next 2 days will make a formal complaint."
5,Movie,"Received order fast, great movie! I purchased for my five year old niece, my kids watched it when they were little."
5,"A wonderful epic, large in imagination and scope.","The last legends of earth is a wonderfully fantastical story were the classical limitations of time and space are broken. Aliens of the future interact in a bid for god-like supremacy long after the civilizations of man have been lost in the dust. Humans become the fodder for spider-like beings and a battle for human freedom ensues. The worlds Attanasio describes are imaginative and timeless. This is a story is a classic Sci-fi adventure but also has retains a sense of humanity, love and the human spirit. This is one of my favorite books by the author; I also recommend his Arthurian series."
2,Cursory explanations and poorly organized,"I was required to use this book for a class, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. Compared to my other books, I find this one to be overly simplistic and disorganized. The book is organized by parts of speech. Within each section it provides simple explanations and ignores the nitty gritty but important details. I've also found that the exercises to not align well with the information just provided but often require details that are provided in the next section or so.If you're looking for a concise French grammar book with well written and complete explanations and plenty of exercises then I suggest you tryThe Ultimate French Review and Practice: Mastering French Grammar for Confident Communicationinstead."
4,Lots of info,"This book covers all the basics that I grew up with, from mom's meatloaf, to the real secret to great cornbread. It is full of useful information regarding techniques used in the south and to some extent the southwest (I grew up in Texas and this is the food we ate) The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the lack of pictures."
3,taxcut 2006,"purchase process was very good from Amazon. the taxcut product has no state info and needs to be updated by downloading directly from internet. for people who have no access to internet, the product is useless. taxcut should have complete products, including federal, state and all updates, available on CD."
2,Premium doesn't do ESPP or Stock Option,"I have used TurboTax for several years. This year TurboTax Premier cost $75, so I thought I would try TaxCut Premium. On the box, it has a check mark on ESPP and Stock Option. It turns out TaxCut is only ""assisting"" on those topic. Meaning, the software will ask you a bunch of question and determine if you need to file it and roughly where in the tax form. I was shock that TaxCut wasn't going to take my ESPP information and put them in the Schedule D and report the Ordinary Income. No wonder TaxCut only cost $29.99 and TurboTax cost $75. TaxCut Premium feature is at most equivalent to TurboTax Deluxe.Beside the ESPP shock, the rest of the program seems comparable to TurboTax, hence 2 stars instead of 1."
4,works just as well as turbotax for less $$$,"taxcut is a little simpler than turbo tax in that the questions are not as specific or detailed. turbo tax is probably better suited for people who are familiar with filling out tax forms. having said that, it does your taxes accurately and costs less. support was great. much better than turbo tax. they seem to care more about service after sale than intuit ever has."
5,best undiscovered show ever,"it was the best physical comedy since i love lucy, too great of a show to survive, not dumb enough for todays viewers!!!!!"
4,"Great show, should've been on TV longer!","Great TV show that unfortunately lasted only one season. Think Meet the Parents, but in TV show format. It is a little predictable at times, but other than that it's great for a laugh."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"The plate arrived as looking beautiful as I expected, and heavy, solid, etc. -- except for one major problem: it had a sticker attached that says it contains paint that has been proven to cause birth defects in children! Lead and cadmium were listed as ingredients. I had planned to use it as a snack/hors d'oeuvres tray for food, and now I can only use it for paper clips or office items. What a disappointment -- and had I ordered a total of four different plates that will all be just as useless. A caveat should have been posted online so the buyer would know the plates can't be used for serving food. This is my first Amazon complaint in MANY years of great results. :(("
3,shop light,nice light for working in garage on car or harley.charge lasts a good while and no cord is good when moving around so you cant trip or unplug.it could be a little brighter but over all I give it a good.
3,decent watch but far from advertised,"I have gone through 3 of these now. I find them advantagous for me as I travel overseas a lot. It helps. The charging feature works well for a year or so, then it craps out."
2,Great Watch won't stay charged,"This is a great watch made for very sunny areas. If I had read a review stating the charge won't last, I never would have purchaced it. I leave it on the window ledge exposed to available light all week and wear it on Sunday and 3-4 hours later the screen is blank. It's definately not for North West areas and the thought of charging it in front of a light bulb is rediculous. Don't buy this watch unless your in a always sunny area. I'm ready to sale this to the highest bidder or give it to one of my South West friends."
2,love it while it works,"After reading other's review, I think I am lucky. the watch's solar power died after 3 years of solid service. It's extreme accurate, no problem receive signal at California. No need to do any daylight saving time or any other adjustment. The only problem is, it solar charging system died. I originally plan to keep it for 10 years, like my Toyota. Now, I probably will look into other watch that has 5 or 10 years battery life. The tough solar really didn't help."
5,Good,This book gives good evidence for the reliability of the scriptures as we have them today. This book is worth reading.
2,wrong ending,"I have read A LOT of Christian fiction and have I never come across and ending where the wrong man was chosen! And to be honest, we were never shown why she chose who she chose."
2,Jakesmom,"This could have been such a wonderful story. The author has a good grasp of what it is like to lose a husband dearly loved and the frustation and loneliness that is left. The character of Danny and what he does to save Dusty and her colt is well researched and authentic. He should have been the hero here.But where in the world did she find Ian? And he is supposed to be a minister? And he performs in a comedy club yet.What happened to Ellie? She is supposed to have alzheimers and yet is lucid at all times. So much more could have been done to show just what happens to those afflicted with this disorder.The end is not only comfusing, it's too simple and abrupt. We should have been given details of how she came to the conclusion that Ian was her choice.What started out to be such a good story just left me flat."
2,This book made me go WHAT?!,"The 2 stars are for a well written story, for what was there at least. The ending as many reviewers have said was abrupt and I could not believe she married the man she did, and of course no reasons were given as to why..so my main reaction to this book is what the heck?? This could have been a good story, but it fell of a cliff at the end!"
3,Interesting but very subjective,"Admittedly, I've not done much in astral travel, so this book may not be for beginners - I do believe the author is highly passionate about her writing - VERY! important in any book, it helped keep me reading...i was just a little put off by the ""this is what you will see"" she seemed to be saying - it seems to offer any ""only"" solution to what i would see when i'm ""silver strung"" - she seems to be telling me what i must see, not what i ""could"" see - i love! her style tho, as i said, very passionate writing!"
1,confusing and fantastic,"Almost all mystics from the Sufis to the the Tibetans talked about a "" City of a Thousand Lights "". No mention of it anywhere in her book or I totally missed it. Her techniques seemed to be ambiguous. From the fingertips of the hands or from the centers of the palms. Clockwise and counterclockwise is relative. Clockwise with a body chakra(say heart center) as a reference point or clockwise with facing the mirror as your as your reference. I am amazed about her story-telling ability."
5,Powerful book and a woman who becomes powerful,"I often read books that make me feel like I wasted hours of my life. This book is not one of them. Except for a couple of silly scenes with a dog, the book really captured my attention. I travel alot and normally can't stay awake on a plane. But once I started this book, all thought of sleep vanished. Really nice to see a powerful woman who could be any of us as the heroine."
4,Only One Song Missing !,"A fantastic film and a great sound track to go with it. New groups and old, very much worth listening to. My only problem with the sound track is that it's missing one song. Right at the end of film during the last scean, a superb tune is playing, what is the title of this song and who's it by ?, some body, please put me out of my missery !!. Only a four star rating, a missing star for a missing song."
4,Missing Song,"Hey, you guys obvoiusly got ahold of the screener version of this movie, which was released before all the soundtrack and score could be finalized. The song is Inside out by Eve 6 (its off their first CD...)"
5,greatest album I own,"I first bought In A Silent Way when I was faced with a year long depression that was prompted by a vapid time in my life. I bought this album to try and feel better about myself. It turned out to have a profound impact on me. No other album can make me feel the way I felt the first time I listened to this. It evokes this odd combination of emotions. The first track, Shhh/peaceful creates a spacy scene, a fluid PERFECT song. The rhythmic continuity provided by the hi-hat and the bass provide the basis of a free-verse poem; a quiet reflection.The second song is like another world.The first time I listened to this song I nearly cried. It's definitely, the most powerful song I've ever heard. I wish I could understand how people can make music sound like that. It's just amazing. Both of the songs reflect my most pensive moods. This is real music.BUY IT."
2,"Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles gives me a headache","Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles and his ""in your face"" trumpet give me a headache.I like funk and groove so I should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene. For me this CD is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums.I was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when I came upon Panthalassa. Track 1 of that CD (In a silent way/Shhh/Peaceful) is nice; smoothing out and grooving out Miles while staying true: say the purists.If you love it remixed and electrofied (yes sir!) check out DJ Cam's tribute to ""In a silent way""."
4,The Birth Of Ambience Jazz,"This session serves as a changing of the guard: from the swinging style of be-bop to the more beat-oriented, electronically textured fusion to come. This is the first Miles Davis release where Wayne Shorter plays a soprano sax, and the change of tone fits this music perfectly. There's two electric keyboardists (Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock), augmented by Joe Zawinul on electric organ, giving this music a spacey, ethereal feel. Overall, this isn't one of Miles Davis' best, but interesting nonetheless."
5,Brilliance Dances Ethereally on Waves of Sound,"One of the pivotal recordings in music history. Seldom are so many elements combined so seamlessly into something new and innovative. Wayne Shorter is wondrous on this recordings a perfect counterpart to Miles. Miles gets an unusual effort out of a host of brilliant musicians. Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams. As each soloist seems to flow forth and then back into the ensemble. A departure from what was being done. Free, yet in control. Flowing, yet very rhythmic. Tony Williams is brilliant throughout. A startling recording."
2,A great album from a great band with terrible sound,"Scour the used vinyl bins for this one and the other fantastic Wackers LPs because whoever mastered this piece of aural junk needs to be re-schooled. This CD sounds like it's coming out of a cheap transistor radio. No warmth, no highs, no lows. It's just a harsh digital soup. So much the pity after waiting for so long for the Wackers to come out on CD. Because they were a great band and Shredder, while uneven, has so much magic that the music itself can elevate and inspire. What a travesty, Collector's Choice. You robbed us of hearing this classic album the way it should be heard - as music. Instead we get pinched ear-bleeding crap that insults the art it contains."
4,Almost perfect,I received this as a present. I absolutely love it but people should know that it is not exactly like the photo of it shown. There are only 2 diamond accents not diamond accents all around the heart like the picture suggests. although it is very hard to tell this unless you are looking closely. Other than that the chain is thin and it is very beautiful I love my gift.
2,Excellent Book....but,"A very good book, too bad that this kindle versions has so many typing errors. It should be reviewed. On some pages there are two typing errors."
4,A dazzling novel,"James Clavell was second to none in decribing the charcters' reasining process. The reader can think he actually knows the characters. However, it seems to me like the author wanted to end the story and did it so abruptly. Unlike Shogun, many stories were left incomplete. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
5,A Master at Work,"This is just a wonderful novel, Clavell at the heightof his powers, and an object lesson to anyone who, 40 years later, wants to write a big, sprawling, historical novel. One of the things that sets Tai-Pan apart from so many books in this genre is that the story is entirely character-driven, and the characters who drive it are wonderful: larger than life without being overblown, consistent throughout, and always engaging. I somehow missed Clavell when he was writing, but a few months back I decided to give him a try, and I have to say that when he's good, as he is here, he's at the top of the class. This is an especially tremendous read for anyone who's lived in, or is interested in, Asia, but it's hard to imagine anyone failing to enjoy it."
2,Over-rated as historical fiction,"This book is highly over-rated and very hard to get through. The author over-loads us with trivial details of complicated espionage. There is not much ""historical"" detail as I would have liked, as in the Michener books. Also, Dirk Struan is such an unlikeable character I couldn't wait for the book to be over so I wouldn't have to read about him anymore"
5,God does it again,"I'm not one of those fans of Devin like Mike Patton fans that think even if he farts into a microphone it is pure gold!!! but Devin is my favourite artist, no doubt. I thought the comeback self titled album was a huge disappointment. Heavy, no substance. Strapping without the Devin touch. But Alien and now The New Black are something completely different. This album shows why Devin is a musical GOD.It is tracks like 'The Death Of Music' that make Devin who he is today, and this album takes his regime to a new level. Tracks like ""Almost Again, The New Black, Monument, Wrong Side"", I'm at a loss for words, pure musical magic. I saw in a review before that Godsmack are the best band on the planet. Listening to this album makes me feel sorry for such misguided, limited people.Buy this album, thank whoever you wish to thank that you love metal and bang your headLong Live REAL metal, it is in short supply in this age of Core new Nu-metal samey boringness."
1,slightly better than the owners manual- good 4 beginners,"I had hoped that this book would demystify such digital details as sizing photos for special uses and serve as a good ""how to source"". I use my pictures in Adode Premiere, web pages, iPhoto, and for email and each requires different aspect ratio, resolution and size. The book covers these issues in general but fails to supply the details of how to change them or why.I returned this book."
3,"When I say Cata, you say Clysm...Cata,clysm. Cata,clysm","Ever driven down Highway 84 and been amazed by the scenery of the Columbia River?Ever curious about how the Columbia became the Columbia?Ever seen a giant bolder in the Willamette Valley and wondered how it got there.Can you imagine the sea level four hundred feet above Portland?You think you know, but you have no idea.Until you read this book! (Or hear about it from a friend.)"
3,decent product,"Overall it's pretty decent product:nice quality (much better feeling than the Amazon picture), small indeed, but as expected. It's about 1.8mm thick, thicker than I would have preferred,it maybe is just me, when it's small hoop, I like it to be proportionally thinner tube. The hinge part is quite out there and not something I fancy, but it's so hard to find small hoops on the market, I guess I will have to live with it. All in all, it's okay."
4,Noteworthy,"As a college student, I chose this book due to my interest in history. It relates to that and much more. The black man's struggle with trying to find an identity in a white society which continues to ignore it. How the prison system oppresses rather than empowers. This book paved the way for the Black Panthers and a better understanding of the civil rights movement. Even though Cleaver is angry and hateful, he is an intelligent and observant writer. He educates himself through reading and writing, even while in the depressing circumstances of prison. His experiences in prison have been captured beautifully. Anyone who wants to understand race relations, incarceration, religion,and literature should read this book!"
2,Justification for the Unjustifiable,"I have seldom read anything as offensive as Cleaver's attempt to pass off rape as a ""revolutionary"" act. By his own admission he is a serial rapist,and if he'd served time for all of them would never even have been out of jail in the sixties in the first place! While the other content of this book isn't totally worthless, I found that Cleaver came off as a typical criminal, filled with reasons why SOMEBODY ELSE was responsible for everything he did wrong. The first step to self respect is to accept responsibility for one's actions, Cleaver has not done that, nor does he give the slightest indication that he ever will. If you want to read an autobiography of a panther read Huey Newton's, because with Newton, instead of self pity, there was substance and intelligence behind the anger."
5,Lost for words,"After reading this book I believe trying to articulate in writing ""what my opinion"" is would be doing it an injustice. The man is brilliant and has influenced me to search for more knowledge and wisdom. Thanks Mr. Cleaver!"
2,Soul should have REMAINED on ice!,"Come off it! Eldridge Cleaver is just another criminal rapist who thinks he got smart in Prison. This book is so bad! It's supposed to be iconoclastic and insightful but it's really just a showcase for the extensive lexicon that Cleaver has. Serously, though, this book reads like that In Living Color skit where those dudes pontificate while they misoginate because they're ingrates and who cares what they ate! So if you are in for hearing how the Man has repressed his human brother for 400 years with a liberal sprinkling of .50 cent words then this book is for you. And there's really only one good essay dealing with prison life (the rest is junk, bunk, no GOOD). If you want to read the real deal forget this book and check out something by Donald Goines or Iceberg Slim."
5,immaculate,"This book is a must! Whoever does not understand it, needs to read the book again, his words are poetic and revolutionary. Anyone who doubts this book, go back and read it."
3,A bit larger and lighter than expected,"I purchased a few different types of these LED keychain lights for personal use, I wanted the type like this that had an on-off switch rather than requiring me to squeeze and hold. I purchased two of this model for use on gym bags and the like, it is a bit larger than the impression I got from the advertizing images (it is about 2.5 inches long), and a bit lighter; I had expected something a bit heavier and more solidly built. For the price, though, it seems a decent light. There's only 'on' or 'off', there's no high-low-blinking option as on other lights. The carabiner-style clip is not easily manipulated for daily use, but is suitable for infrequent attachment and detachments. I wouldn't think it suitable for a keychain. I'm sure I'll use these, but I'm unlikely to buy more of this design. I also purchased a couple of 'Energizer High Tech LED Keychain Light' which are more solidly built and heavier, those made it to my keychains."
2,"The light was hard to push on, if one have a problem with their finger then there would be a problem to push the light on.","The light is hard to push on, it should be very smooth and easy to push not stiff to pus on.Not a very good design."
4,As advertised.,"Just what I expected. There are times when I want to wear a belt but also want the extra support of suspenders. These are made for those occasions. Works well when wearing an unbuttoned shirt over a tee shirt, put the suspenders over the Tee and the outer shirt over that and no one can tell you are wearing suspenders."
5,good find good price,I was very happy to fine this produce. This was a great price and I got it fast.I would recomend this to anyone.
3,"more than earlier ones, less than current ones",good story...good characters. what would i do if it happened to me? lose 50 pounds and stop reading romances!
4,Satisfying Relationship Drama,Delinsky's trademark has always been smart and sensitive handling of family dynamics and she doesn't disappoint here.The Daphne character is endearing.
1,Rich Young & Pretty,"Since I'm not a fan of Vic Damone and Jane Powell, my mother is and should be the real person for this review, however, she doesn't work a computer, therefore it's impossible for you to get a review from her using this method."
4,This is Tight!,"I recently purchased this headset microphone. I saw the inexpensive price and i kind of figured that it was cheap and it wouldn't work. I proved myself wrong. It doesnt have as high of quality as some of its competitors but if your in the market for an inexpensive midranged quality microphone, this product is for you. I reccomend this headset for gaming/multimedia."
4,Delicious Craving,"Chase, the last standing single brother of the Westmorelands, is content with his life. Business is great at his restaurant, his family is good, what more could he want? Not marriage, that's for sure. His brothers may have fallen prey, but not Chase.Jessica Claiborne is new to town. Along with opening a confectionary, she's looking to right a wrong from the past. And no one, including her sexy neighbor, Chase is going to stand in the way of that; even if that means concealing her true identity from him. Like Chase, marriage is not for her either.If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Just how hot will things get between Chase and Jessica?As always, Ms. Brenda did her thing. With Chase's story now told, I can't wait to see which Westmoreland cousin is next."
2,Mediocre,The songs by Ayub Ogada and Geoffery Oryema are great! Unfortunately the rest of the soundtrack music doesn't hold up to the African's musical stylings. It was interesting to hear Italian and African themes woven together - although as a whole I found this CD disappointing. I recommend you purchase a CD by Ogada or Oryema instead of this one.
2,Enjoyed the vocals - instrumental too long,I saw the movie and loved the African vocals by Ayub Ogada and Geoffery Oryema. The background music is lush and romantic - when taken in small doses on the big screen. The extended compositions on the CD just drag on. I would recommend that you get a CD by Ayub Ogada instead of this soundtrack.
4,Very well written,"This book is great and explains bdsm as a spiritual experience make sense.The writers are also very talented. For a book that is not story-based, I was surprisingly hooked."
4,Really cute,"I first discovered Hunter Hayes while I was watching Maury on channel 4. He was on the ""Talented Young People show. I thought his Six Years Old song was really cute and I can totally relate to some of his songs!"
4,"Love the show, but should've waited to buy a set","I bought my boxed set here on amazon, but now I am worried it may not be legit.On the packaging there are multiple spelling errors, which may be symptomatic of simple misreads/typos on a ""first production,"" yet they occur rather frequently. Since I have season 3 in front of me, I'll use some examples from that one:Description for Disc one's ""Informed Consent"" reads ""House and his team fine themselves at odds..."" instead of ""find."" Disc 3's ""Words and Deeds"" reads ""...in order to acoid jail..."" instead of ""avoid.""I wouldn't usually be concerned about typos, but when they occur this frequently, and I spent practically the msrp, I would hope that it wasn't bootlegged.Nonetheless, the show itself is very entertaining, but perhaps I should have waited until season 6 was also released on DVD, thus purchasing a complete series..."
3,window,I was disappointed when this piece arrived The part was broken It is being sent back for a replacement Hopefully the replacement will not be broke
3,"cute idea, but boring","i got this for my 2 yo, thinking it would keep her occupied in the vehicle...it didn't. i have to say she looked at it once and didn't care to look at it again. it is very cute, but maybe for an older child who's imagination is more active. all in all, i think it LOOKS like there's alot of stuff to do in Granny's Purse, but in reality there's not much."
2,Great idea but....,"We received this as a gift. It is a really cute idea and cleverly designed, but not very practical for little kids. It's pretty flimsy considering it's suppose to stand up to the attention of a toddler- it's only made out of cardboard. There are so many little pieces that are easily lost. Like I said- wonderful idea but you would be better off just taking an old purse and filling it up with real items- old keys, old plastic sunglasses, etc."
3,Poor Support from HP,"I bought this computer, wanting to support the Livestrong Foundation and thinking the computer was a decent buy. The hard drive crashed after 6 months, and I spent many wasted hours with HP's technical support overseas, ended up having to pay for shipping for the orders I received, and they refused to send me a copy of the warrantly information."
2,"Not up to her previous works, but a must for fans.","Judging an author's body of work by only reading one novel, and her last novel written at the very end of her long life, is infantile, the equivalent of watching Steven Spielberg's ""1941"" and judging him to be a mediocre talent and not worthy of further viewing.This is Mrs Thirkell's final completed novel and like the majority of her later works, not up to the standards of her finest work of the Thirties and Forties, but it's a must read for fans of the Barsetshire series. For newcomers to her books, I would recommend any of the Barsetshire novels of the Thirties, but particularly ""Summer Half"", ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Pomfret Towers"", ""The Brandons"" or ""High Rising"". These early novels can be read as stand alones that introduce the characters featured throughout the series and are witty, dry, well-written comedies of manners."
5,bumpin,i re-bought this cd bc the old one i had was all scratched up and wouldnt play on my favorite parts. I love it. I was playing it on blast in my car while at a stop light and people on the street wanted to know what cd it was. :) great cd.
4,It sounds like the blues,"Robert Johnson is generally regarded as the greatest bluesman of all time. This CD shows where he got his music from. The songs on this CD have remarkably similar melodies, and sometimes lyrics, to songs Robert Johnson later recorded. The CD booklet give technical information about the similarities, and differences, between these songs and Johnson's songs. (Most of that information went right over my head.) By the way, Johnson should not be looked down upon for copying other people's songs. That is a common practice in the blues industry. But aside from the historical importance of being influential to Robert Johnson, these performances are good in their own right. But one problem with the CD is that the sound quality is pretty bad on some of these songs. (""Preachin' The Blues"" by Son House is practically unlistenable.) But if you can get past the poor sound, and you are interested in the roots of the blues, you should enjoy this CD."
3,No Sense!!,"I love the sequel to this book, but this book I found slightly insulting. Don't get me wrong, Julia Quinn is definitely the author I look for in romance novels, but this book didn't have enough plot. I am insulted by Robert's distrust of Victoria in the beginning, not even asking why she was in bed that fateful night 7 years ago, but lays it down on her being an evil, mean, fortune hunter. It takes Ellie (one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth in How to Marry a Marquis) to pop his view of Victoria and tell him what really happened. And then he acts all surprised as if, ""Gee, I guess I was wrong all of this time and made my life and her life miserable for the past seven years, oops!"" I am glad I read Brighter Than the Sun first or I would have lost interest in Ms. Quinn."
2,Disappointing!,"Other Julie Quinn books are entertaining, but Everything and the Moon was boring, redundant, and full of cliches. Usually she comes up with a somewhat original story line, but this one has been written over and over again. Don't waste your money."
5,one of the best,"This has to be probably my favorite blues album I own. I really appreciate how the remastering tried to keep the integraty of the songs by not removing the surface noise for it would ruin the songs. Many people don't like his piano tracks but if you really give them a listen, there is some very sophistacated piano here. He can play the piano as well, if not better, than the guitar. Of course his guitar playing is amazing. If you like clean, crisp recordings, please avoid this. If you want a glimpse into the history of the blues by one of the greatest blues artists, pick this one up. You won't be dissappointed."
4,Epistemology: A Sourcebook,"Here is a volume that contains dozens of essays and articles on epistemology, ranging from classical times to the modern age. This anthology will act as an introduction to Epistemology, while it also presents material that is more comprehensive and authoritative, as it shifts from the basic to the specific. Pojman's third edition is a valuable philosophical sourcebook that should not be overlooked."
4,Works great.,"Bought this the other month for a quick-and-fast movie we shot, and it worked perfectly and was well worth the cost. We had three cameras on three shoulder mounts, each with a different way of fixing the monitor to their camera, and this was the easiest and most convenient."
5,"Useful, no-nonsense perspective","I happened upon this book about 25 years ago, after reading lots and lots of psychology books. The ideas presented here are simple, but profound. I've used the idea that rigid behavior results from moments of distress, and that the emotional damage done to people can be healed by listening to them, in a wide range of ways since then. Jackins takes a refreshing departure from psychobabble, and I use his perspective daily in my work with parents and children, to explain why we parents have to make such an effort not to repeat the behavior of our parents when we're under stress, and why children seem to get upset over the smallest things over and over again. Overall, it's a generous attitude toward human nature that is taken, one that offers hope and simple things one can do to help oneself and to help others in a practical yet significant way. It's worth a read!"
1,"OMG...Only the gore was good,the movie SUCKED",I bought this DVD casue of all the psitive reviews it got.what a WASTE.the only good thing about this movie was the gore/melting effects.the movie itself was dumb and pointless with no real plot what so ever.how anyone can give this five stars is beyond me.rent if your courious otherwise dont bother.
3,Ass Clown,"Street Trash has a lot of hype. and for good reason. lots of great over the top effects and explosions. some good toilet humor and a great nuts bad guy. drags on at parts, the ending is too quick, but if you like dirty hobo's, farts, and melting faces (and who the hell doesn't), then this is a must."
5,A fantastic voyage into the Mysteries of Time,"Very well written, especially interesting is the mixture of anecdotes and biographical data on the scientists and their theories, so this is not a 'cold' science divulgation book. In just 200+ pages, the author reviews most of moderm Physics, with elegancy and simplicity. The speculations and descriptions of Time Machine at the end of the book are simply fascinating, and make your fantasy fly. Very suitable for laic people and also for science students and professionals."
4,This is an excellent book,"This is an excellent book. Goddard has written about some amazing characters that remain with you long after the book is done. This is also one of his less ""character heavy"" books. Sometimes there are too many characters to keep up with but this down it is down to the minimum. There are several twists and turns with a surprise ending. Goddard's books occasionally are difficult to get going with the middle being the most exciting portion. This book started out exciting and was a page-turner until the end. Highly recommended."
5,Bought time!,"Finally! Jennifer's new album was well worth the wait! She has grown not only as a young woman but as an artist. Her voice is better than ever. The song choice has changed since""Dulzura"" but only got better. This is a MUST HAVE for jennifer fan new or old!"
4,So happy they put this on DVD!,"I learned about this show on Cartoon Network and loved it from the moment I saw it. I haven't watch all the episodes in this in this First Season yet, so my review is not going to be that in-depth.The only drawback I can think of so far is the fact that the first couple of episodes aren't as funny but as I go up in episodes, it does get funnier.I'm really glad I bought it and glad I found it on Amazon."
5,this does the job! but i warn you to be careful as i sliced my thumb open and it hurt like *ell!!! So please please be careful w,this does the job! but i warn you to be careful as i sliced my thumb open and it hurt like *ell!!! So please please be careful when using these items! and keep them away from children!
2,Not very sharp Tiara Blade,"I was really disappointed in this Blade. It was not sharp enough for me and my application. I was tempted to send it back and might still do so. It is not imprinted with the Fiskars logo and although in the proper packaging, I question whether it is the genuine product. Any other blades I have purchased on line or in stores have worked fine. I like the design just not the sharpness."
3,Good read,I enjoyed reading a story centered in my beloved U.P. It s fun to know exactly where the characters are and picture them driving down familiar roads.
5,Great Experience,I have searched high and low for this watch. Went to every known department store and every Jewelry store within 50 miles of my home. I did Find it here for considerably less that what I was willing to pay even! What a Deal!My transaction & delivery went without a hitch. I am more than satisfied with everything!
4,Great watch; not quite petite,"I really like this watch. It captures my heart rate accurately and is very easy to use and to reset whenever necessary. It's a bit larger than I expected, though -- not quite ""petite."" I'm extremely satisfied with it, however."
5,Beth's best...,"I have all of Beth's previous releases, and I think she's given us her best work yet! It was worth the long wait!"
1,Mediocrity at its best,"This book characterizes much of what is wrong with the current way in which text-books are pumped out by authors/academics/publishers to serve as a new yet ultimately qualitatively useless addition to the heap of knowledge in any given field. It is not that the topics presented here are useless, meaningless or anything of the sort, it is simply that the mediocrity with which they are written about and presented to the reader- supposedly a student attempting to learn about these subjects- is apparant on nearly every page.If the mark of someone who truly understands their field of study is their ability to clearly and easily convey and teach it to others, than many of the contributors to this book do not truly understand their field, certainly not to the extent that they should when being held up as the fore front of their academic field. Read or Buy if you must, but turn to others sources for a better reading and learning experience."
4,Informative,"If you enjoy learning about diseases and their function than this book is a good choice. I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for extensive information, not just an easy read."
2,Metro lines and stations not clearly marked.,"The bright side is the durable material this map is made from, which guarantees no wrinkles and easy folding.However, when it comes to the information presented, then I was disapointed. After my visit to DC it was obvious to me that the Metro stations and Metro lines are not clearly shown. Also,the map does not show the route and stops of threCirculator bus, which is a rather new and usefull mean of transporation for visitors.Finaly, I ended up using the free tourist map that I took from the hotel lobby."
3,"Good for easy listening, not the thrilling stuff","What made me listen to riverdance in one word is, Thrilling.And the rest of the good stuff attributed to something as famous as this one.This CD lacks the thrill and excitment which Riverdance: Music From The Show [SOUNDTRACK] ASIN: B000005B2O this CD has, however this is a excellent CD for those audiance who love riverdance and usually go very easy on their ears, and not looking for riverdance to increase their heart rate 1 and a half the normal. I am very passionate about music, I said precisely ""passionate"". so this is not a good buy for me."
2,Disappointing,"As a vegetarian going vegan, the table of contents promised to answer a lot of my questions, such as will I be able to keep my weight and what is a good vegan diet for physical excercise.To my disappointment, many of the headlines covered only chit-chatty chapters on the subjects, revealing the authors' lack of authority on the basic nutrition.What's even worse is, I found the general tone quite self rightious, which in my oppinion is a very poor way of advocating vegan living."
4,About Vegan *Living*,"This is a fantastic book about vegan living. Most books out there are about vegan diets or echo-friendly living, but this book combines both aspects. Compassion for animals and the planet Earth and a healthy diet. It covers vegan living thoroughly and it made me want to learn more about a lot of subjects. Unfortunately there are a few mistakes here and there and a few assumptions based on flawed scientific studies which bothers me more than it should, because they aren't really all that common.If you want to lead a healthier life that is based on respect for your body and our planet this is a good book to start. It is also nice if you are simply trying to understand your vegan friend. Just don't be scared by its sometimes extreme views on life."
5,A Great Collection of Lesser-Known Bluesmen (and Women),"I LOVE this CD! After you've been through all the Skip James, Son House, Charley Patton, and Robert Johnson, this is a great place to go. I was pleased to find the haunting Geeshie Wiley song ""Last Kind Words"" that was used in the documentary ""Crumb"". Also here is ""Outside Woman Blues"" covered by Eric Clapton in his Cream days. A great collection with great notes, Yazoo does it again!"
4,"The focus is on the life, not the works","The fourth volume in Reynolds's multi-volume biography of Hemingway. Unlike other Hemingway biographers (James Mellow, for instance) who are mostly interested in how the author incorporated his own life into his fiction, Reynolds approaches his subject in a strict chronological fashion and hardly touches upon the works at all. This volume begins in 1929 with Ernest and Pauline returning to Paris while he put the final touches on ""A Farewell to Arms,"" and ends with Ernest beginning to write ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and taking up residence with Martha Gellhorn in Havana. Very detailed in terms of H.'s life and doings, much less so with regard to his works and art. Definitive in that respect, but not where to go to get an appreciation of Hemingway the writer and the forces behind his artistic creations."
1,"Didn't live up to the ""hype""","For all the people who said this was such a great, quirky little movie, ""Must See""...I was really, really disappointed. Even if I never heard of it before and saw it on TV, I would have stopped 1/2 through. It had maybe two laughs...otherwise, this would have been a great project for someone in junior college film school. A terrific waste of Zane, Beals and especially Harry Shearer. Could have been much more over-the-top with two more script revisions."
5,Wow...,"This singer has it all, bold, sassy, flirty, and fun. She can growl out a saucy tune or pitch a sweet, clear sounding melody that makes you smile, remebering sweeter, more innocent times. Ever since viewing her video presentation of Out Here In The Water, I've been frantically searching for this release, knowing if she could make me smile with that tune, there had to be more equally as good. It was worth the wait."
2,"Bad, really bad","Forget the plot. I won't bore you with it. It tries to be all things to all men and ends up being nothing. The protaganist's worry about the baby birds from the nests she is photographing is ludricrous. Yes, have some sympathy but don't go around telling the whole world. NOBODY CARES. The romance is shallow and Ms. Ennis never makes it or the characters believable. None of the characters are believable. It really has the feeling of being slapped together in a very short time. Don't waste your money on this one. Hot romantic scenes cannot make up for the disconnected nature of this book."
5,(untitled),"After trying at least four other proofreading exercise programs over the years, I've finally found the winner of the bunch. These proofreading exercises are at just the right level for my middle schoolers, and the humor keeps them engaged. The jokes are helping improve my EL students' reading comprehension, as well. At first, my EL students had to frequently ask for the explanation to a joke. Now, most of them pick up on the context clues that create the humor. I highly recommend ""Phunny Stuph."""
5,Ver funny stuff!!!,"This book has been wonderful to use in my 8th grade Language Arts classes as a daily warm-up. The students enjoy reading and correcting these funny stories way more than anything else I have tried. In fact, I ordered this book because one of my students was sitting with me as I previewed it and was laughing out loud! It is well worth the purchase!"
2,Good starting point for undergraduate students,"This book covers a wide range of different and important subjects of this field and provides by this a good overview to students new in neuroscience. On the other hand side, the topics discussed are not described thoroughly, but stay on the surface. This maybe no big problem for undergraduates who try just to understand the basics but certainly this is not satisfactory for more advanced students or researches.In my opinion, this book blurs the view of the reader by presenting results about experiments and theoretical models side by side in a way that no fair and solid discussion is provided indicating clearly the limitations and problems of current models. By this, one could get the feeling that the presented models are more than tool to analyse data. However, exactly this is not true for most of the models as can be seen by the fact that these models can also be found in other areas than neuroscience with other interpretations."
2,"Decent book, exceedingly technical, mathematical rigorous",I'm a neuroscience major and a medical student currently.I bought this book to get a strong grasp of the theoretical underpinnings of computational neuroscience. The math is not simple and if you don't have any beyond 1st year college level Calculus you won't get far with this book. I recommend it for those with at least a minor in mathematics beyond the Calculus level.
5,book,This is a great book and I was wonderfully surprised to see the large print. My grandmother loved it as her Christmas present. It's well written and keeps your intrest.
1,Not worth what little it costs.,"This player is unreliable at best. Often, When you close the disc tray it doesn't slide all the way back in so the player can't read the disc. I actually have to open the tray door and push the tray into place. Also, It will play a disc just fine one day, and the next the same disc skips, freezes, loses audio, etc. Maybe it has overheating issues but I don't really care. Any player that takes away from your viewing enjoyment isn't worth the money at any price."
1,Dud,This is not worth wasting your time over. Poor quality comedy with no talent and no plot. Save yourselves the time and pass on this one.
1,Super High Me,"I bought this movie thinking it would have some great facts along with humor like Totaly Baked does. It turns out that this movie was not very funny having only a couple funny spots. And the facts? Hard to say if any of them are true because in the portion when he is OFF weed for 30 days he still seems just as high as when is smoking everyday. Dont get me wrong, i was baked when i watched it. Not Recommended. Totaly Baked by far is 100x better than this movie, unless you just want to watch a guy smoke pot for a whole movie."
3,Could have been better....,"Let me start by saying that I am a proponent of both decriminalization and legalization (with regulations) so this review is not of the topic but the way it was presented. My review is basically that the topic was solid but Doug didn't follow it through. It's like writting a thesis paper and having a strong introduction and not enough information in the body of the paper. He could have done a lot more simply by giving more facts about marijuana and it's use. I expected something more like Super Size Me meets Grass, and sadly this isn't that movie."
2,Rip off,The pump is to small for an 6x8 pond!Did not come with plant baskets. I waited for over a month because they lost the order.NOT a good deal!!!
5,a real classic,"I agree with the previous reviewer who calls this book comprehensive and readable. Postgate makes learning microbiology fun and accessible, without ""dumbing it down"" or coming off in a condescending manner. While updates to the 4th edition include (among other things) genetic engineering and gene therapy, the book has thankfully not become just another gee-whiz molecular biology book. While biochemistry and genetics play an important role in differentiating microbes from each other and making them much more functionally diverse than us ""higher organisms"" are, there is a lot more to learn about microbiology than just molecular structures and mechanisms. Postgate maintains his focus on the microorganisms and their impacts upon society. The result is an admirably small and inexpensive book, with far more balance and clarity than I've found in any of the fat and pricey ""fundamental"" microbiology textbooks."
3,"Good, but hardly definative.....","This is NOT the definative Billy Joel one might want. While it contains a lot of his hits, it skips many others, like Top 10 hits You May Be Right, You're Only Human, Modern Woman, A Matter Of Trust, and I Go To Extremes, along with others that made the Top 20. In place of the big hits, we get drivel such as Scandinavian Skies, New York State of Mind, and Goodnight Saigon. That said, why did I buy this one? To get the edited single/radio versions of Piano Man, My Life, Just The Way You Are, We Didn't Start The Fire, and All About Soul. If you're like me, you'll need this CD for that reason alone. Now, if we could just get a volume 2 containing the missing pieces (in their single edits....please), I'll be very happy."
3,Interesting follow up,"For continuing professional development, research material and just information, this was an easy informative read."
3,Leadership on the Line,I like the book quite a bit. It gave me a different way to look at leaders and leadership
3,Good beginners,"This book is a great book for beginners in the world of piano playing. However, the book took almost a month to arrive and the condition of the book was in the range of moderate. Wasn't impressed yet I wasn't disappointed either."
5,Great performance!,Excellent ballet performance of the classic Nutcracker story. A must see for anyone that loves ballet and Baryshnikov. Great orchestra accompanyment
3,The classic Nutcracker,"I chose this Blu-ray specifically because of Baryshnikov dancing and his performance is excellent, however it is a very poor quality copy, not worth the high price I paid. Had it been reconditioned, it would be fine, but instead it's not fun to watch such poor quality. Newer versions have much better quality, lovely settings and good dancers. I do not recommend this due to the poor quality and lack-luster of the settings. Music is great."
2,Not up to snuff.,"I would have expected way more picture quality from a Blu-Ray. Performance is adequate but cinematic choice leaves much to be desired, IMHO. I would have p[referred a ""5th row seat"" view."
5,Full of life and music,Mr Baryshnikov throws his whole soul into the Nutcracker music withgraceful energy and leaping bounds. Miss Kirkland is so light andgentle on her feet that she literally floats across the stage.
4,Not for HD,"The American Ballet Theatre DVD has great music and dancing but it was not produced for HD in 1977. If picture quality is important, I suggest purchasing the more modern 2008 San Francisco ballet production. The SF choreography has far more charm than the dark ABT version. Nevertheless, one cannot top Kirkland's dancing with Baryshnikov."
3,kept getting the wrong nutcracker video,"I ordered a specific Nutcracker ballet video: the one danced & choreographed by Mikhail Baryshnikov. Instead of the video, I ended up getting credit for the purchase, as two separate shipments of nutcracker videos were not the Baryshnikov version. But the seller DID reply promptly, did take action promptly and did issue credit promptly."
4,Good date night movie,My wife and I enjoyed watching this on a Friday night on the home theater system. It was like having a front row seat.
4,"Not Bad, but not the Best.","This is my fifth Force FX lightsaber. Its beautiful but a bit heavy. The sound is very muffled and the hilt it a bit too thick to be accurate. Although its my favorite design, the Luke Skywalker Green lightsaber is much better. Its the brightest and loudest I have out of the Ep.2 and Ep.3 Anakin, Darth Vader, and this Obi Wan. If your a huge Obi Wan fan like myself its great, but if your not on a Star Wars kick when you get it your likely to be a bit disappointed as I was."
4,Overpriced for 17 minutes of audio recording,I was very disappointed in the content and amount of content in this audible book. For the price of $6.95 I felt there should have been more concrete advice. The voice was salesman aggressive in its delivery: fast and high pitched. I definitely did not feel I got my money's worth.
3,Entertaining,"My wife bought this book for me brand new for fifty cents out of a bargain bin, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. The main characters are intelligent and humanly flawed. The plot centers on a sea voyage---no sword and sorcery here, only a fascinating and detailed glimpse into the ""mundane"" life of a merchant. A bit wordy in some places, it's obviously written by a guy who knows his history, but sometimes has a hard time working it into a story. If you don't mind skimming the unnecessary polis information and dialogue attribution to get to the good story parts, you'll find it a very entertaining read. It's good enough that I'm about to buy the sequel.Pete"
5,Timer,This unit is the cat's meow.For the longest time the heater fan in the bathroom was always running. With this you push one of the preset times and it goes off when time runs out. Best of all it is silent not like the old spring wound timers.Wished I had it years ago.
1,Requires neutral for installation,"This requires a neutral. Make sure you have it set up this way before you buy this switch, or have easy access to add additional wiring."
4,"Good bedrail, but not compatible with toddler beds","This is a great bedrail. It is so much easier to use than the old one I had for my son. Side is easy to move up and down for making the bed, which is GREAT!!! And, it stays in place securely once the side is raised. We ordered this for my daughters toddler bed because it said it was compatible. However, when we received the box, it said NOT to use on toddler beds. Every other bedrail on the market (that we found) said the same thing. So my husband found a safe way to attach the rail to the bed under the mattress, rather than just relying on the weight of the mattress to hold it up. So it works for us. Just be aware of this if you are looking for a bedrail for a toddler bed. The company who makes this was very helpful when I called with questions about it. Pleasant customer service!"
3,Not quite long enough,"Once you finally figure out how to put the rail together, it's a piece of cake to assemble. I love how compact it is while traveling. My biggest complaint is that it is a little short. I wish it were at least 6-12 inches longer. I wouldn't use this as a permanent bed rail for my daughter, but it's great for travel."
4,Only 1 problem,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. We had just gotten her a full size bed and of course, didn't want her falling out. It was a little hard to get to stay clicked on top, but we did get it done. The only problem you are supposed to be able to let it down when not needed, which you can, but I guess her mattress and boxspring are not thick enough or the frame is not high enough because we don't have enough room to let it down. I hits the floor 12 inches from the bed. We could raise the frame but then the bed would be hard to get in and out of for her."
3,Horrible instructions,"I just got this for my daughter's new big girl bed and really had a struggle putting it together. The instructions that came with it are so bad I found myself wishing for Ikea instructions instead! Normally I wouldn't mind so much, but for a child's safety product instructions really should be better to make sure it is being installed properly. Even though it comes with a travel bag I really don't think we'll be taking it to grandma's, it is way too much hassle to take apart. Also, like another review said, it will not fold down unless the bed has a box spring."
3,The Greatest VS the Others,"Stephen Brunt is hands down, Canada's best sports writer. True, that is akin to being the world's tallest midget but still. Give the man his dues. This is an interesting read, looking at some of the lesser lights who took on The Champ, such as Jurgen Blin, Joe Bugner and of course, The Bayonne Bleeder Chuck Wepner, whose life story inspired (cough) Stallone. For an interesting look at the latter and the associated lawsuit against Sly, ESPN did a documentary called The Real Rocky. Anyway, each of the fighters, some notable (Ken Norton), some obscure (Karl Mildenberger - to me anyway - I know Max Schmelling, but didn't know this Teuton with the southpaw style that confused Ali, briefly) describe the hype and hope surrounding their squared circle encounters."
5,Great product for helping with UTI,I was at a loss with curing my urinary tract infections. this was my lifesaver. my local health alternative store recomended this for me and i will never be without this in my medicne cabinet. its a must have for UTI's.
3,A PARADOX,"I FIND GAIA PRODUCTS TO BE OF HIGH QUALITY; UNFORTUNATELY I'VE FOUND THEM TO BE UNHELPFUL, AND SOMETIMES DOWNRIGHT NASTY ON THE PHONE. SORRY, I CALLS THEM THE WAY I SEES THEM!"
3,Blast from the Past,"I just happened upon this book on the back shelf. I hadn't seen it in years. It was required reading for some course I had in college. It cost 50 then. I think I'll read it again, see if it sounds familiar. (At my age I have difficulty remembering day before yesterday!)"
4,A Blues/Rock Rollercoaster,"The term ""understated"" certainly doesn't apply to Walter Trout's guitar playing on this cd, but who cares? When you can play with the fury and tenacity that Trout does to hell with being subtle. Though the constant machine gun fire of licks and runs can get a bit repetitive after a while, this cd was meant to capture the essence of Trout live and it certainly does that. The Free Radicals are the perfect backing band for Walter's gruff voice and blazing guitar. Man, this guy can wail!!! If you're looking for a blues/rock cd that will get your heart pumping and your foot flooring the accelerator, this is it."
3,Overreach.,"Fantastic evocation of down and out-er in Mexico; but the plot becomes so unbelieveable insofar as a hobo miraculously becomes a Hollywood star only to scorn a 3 movie contract for stupid reasons. Cain tries too hard maybe to blend Chandler and Hemingway. This also shows the limitations of 1st person narration. Eventually, I couldn't stand the ""Then I did this. . . Then I did that"" so many times on the same page. Runs around too much to get to a fairly predictable ending."
4,Surprisingly Effective as an Album,"I don't really like greatest hits packages, but this one does a nice job summarizes the first few albums that had Joe Walsh onboard. Putting aside the radio hits, this is a surprisingly effective and cohesive look at a creative rock trio in the late 60s and early 70s. I especially like the slower songs, such as ""Take a Look Around,"" which features plaintive singing, organ work, and sounds a lot like very early Todd Rundgren. ""Ashes the Rain and I"" is another quieter song that really works.But the highlight is clearly ""Bomber,"" which hits you over the head with multiphased songs, changes, and sequences, an epic tune that leaves you blissfully satisfied and ready for that final toke before you go to bed....."
1,Not Durable - Not Recyclable,"I purchased this item at a local retailer, and returned it the next day after taking it out of the package it came in. The plastic is thin and flimsy, the hinges are very weak, and on top of all this the plastic isn't recyclable. For me there's not a single redeeming feature about this particular soap holder. I knew I'd be throwing it away in no time.If you're looking for something durable look elsewhere."
5,PARADISE LOST,"As a former major seminarian myself, there is no doubt that Mr. Kelley has experienced the vagaries of life in stir at a Catholic institution that prepares men for the pristhood. GEMINI has refreshed my recollection of the numerous hysterical events that occur when you bring together confused young men for a singular purpose who are unsure whether or not they have chosen well. Sex and priestly vocation always make for a humerous yet psychologically fascinating topic especially when you write from a hands on experience. I have read the book twice. I enjoyed it more the second time. If you have even spent one week in study for the priesthood, do not miss GEMINI. (So there is no confusion, this review was written by Margaret's alleged boss.)"
5,great solution,I had an extension cord going half way around a room tucked by the baseboard to turn a light on from the switch at the door. This wireless switch was just the thing I needed to get rid of that ugly extension cord. It was easy to install and works great.
2,Channel B does not work,"As commented by another reviewer, the switch does not work when both the transmitter and receiver are set to channel B.Channel A does not work for me (some interferences cause the light to go on and off repeatedly), so this switch is useless for me.A total waste of money."
5,lot of good ideas...,"in this very readable book . . . i think just about anybody, at any level, could pick up something by reading this informative book."
4,EXCELLENT! MUST READ,"This is the third book in the dream series. This book has many different twists and turn that will keep you reading long into the night. The way Shara feels about being the odd-one-out in the InnerWorld, then people start disappearing all over the place. The mysterious person that turn up to lead Shara and Gabreil on a serious wild-goose chase over time and distance ,not knowing that if she does what she has been told will destroy her family.Gabriel is the one who is the most pratical in the quest. As it is usually the woman who is pratical it was a change to let the male be serious. The way the plot leads you to the time when the Greek Gods rules and discribes in detail the orgies they had. Here is where Shara and Gabriel discover they attraction to each other and share the same 'mating fever'as the action gets more intense. I'll not tell the end , but definitely a must read and keep."
5,A MUST READ AND A MUST SHARE!!!!!!,"We received this book from a family friend and it has taken off into a study with the church youth group. It is a challenge to witness as Mark Cahill does but you will agree, it is a challenge one will feel great about as the witnessing continues throughout your own life. Get one for yourself and for all your family and friends. Pass it on to a stranger. You never know who you can help."
5,One Thing You Can't Do In Heaven,"This is simple, but profound read. If you are looking for a book on how to share your faith in Christ then I would recommend this one."
4,Pet Thermometer Covers,"These are used with the Pet Temp thermometer. I find that they are pretty easy to apply. I messed up one early on, but none after that."
4,Class of 62 Rules!,"Good compilation of Philly area hits of the rock era. It nicely filled agap in my oldies collection. Bobby Rydell, Chubby Checker, Orlons,and what a nice surprise: Charlie Gracie doing ""Butterfly""! This isa collection worth having, Only question I have, why did they take so long releasing it?"
3,Back to the original theme,"For those who remember the first Howling, this will be similar in story. Unlike the second and third, this one is much more traditional and less ""out there."" There is much less nudity in this one than the second, which may kill it for some fans. The gore level is about the same though. It falls short of the original in some ways, but still holds the ""who is it"" theme. It also fits in with the fnial movies of the series as they often fall back to this one as the start.The DVD is very nice and the movie is also better than some other 80s cheap movies. The actors may not be well known today, but they were there when this was filmed. It holds much better to the original than the hammy acting in the second movie. For the price paid, this was a steal. Still, it may not appeal to all the gore-hounds out there because it isn't blood soaks or the women topless (clothing or otherwise). The implied violence to the small dog can also offend some."
5,Vanishing languages and why they are threatened,"Mark Abley's Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages may sound like a travel title and at times may read like an armchair adventure; but its more important application to literary and language studies should not be missed. Abley travels around the world to document its endangered languages: of the six thousand spoken In the world today, only six hundred are likely to survive into the next century. Chapters provide social and cultural insights in the process of considering these vanishing languages and why they are threatened."
5,Gift,This was a gift for a very dear friend who is a serious bible researcher. He loves this translation and was unable to find a copy.
4,A refreshing look at holy writ,"This book was purchased from Amazon.Having been raised since my birth on the King James version of the Bible with all its antiquated and often stately language, I found J.B.Phillips translation of the New Testament to be a refreshing change. The message of the Gospel, couched in present day English, comes through clearly, beautifully and convincingly. This purchase is the fourth time for me, having worn out the previous three.This latest one has no verse markings, perhaps to make it more readable. I prefer it with them."
2,An OK Hacker Book,"Having read a number of books on this subject, this was an just ok read. From the explanation the author gave of the kids, I came away thinking they were just script kiddies and nothing more. The author does not go into detail of the hacks and mostly covered just dos attacks and defacing websites.I wish the author had talked about more old-school hackers like lod/mod war, capn crunch, kevin poulsen (my favorite read: the watchman).However it was interesting to hear how the kids got involved with hacking and what each hackers personality and lifestyle was."
1,Terrible book,This may be the worst book I have read in years and I would like to get my money back. These kids are only interesting inwhat they do and how they do it. They are very accomplished in that regard but the author didn't or probably couldn't explain that. There are far better books about hackers and these kids deserved a better author.
1,a perfect flag for burning,go's up in smoke quite nicely.FREE PALESTINE!burns quite nice with a union jack and northern ireland flag.also makes good a door mat the wipe your feet.and also makes great toilet paper when youve all ran out.
3,A comprehensive resource for connecting compulsive behavior to abuse,"As a survivor of abuse as a very young child, it was very difficult for me to connect my own destructive, compulsive behavior to abuse. By researching the stories of many other survivors in this book I've been able to piece together what most likely happened. Survivors should be prepared for some potentially triggering content while reading, but it's still a good resource. Topics from eating disorders to alcohol and drugs are covered, and I'm starting to ""get it"" that all escape behaviors can be tied to childhood abuse, neglect, or shame of some kind.The three-star rating would have been more if the content were not so triggering, and because my own recovery draws more from authors such as Patrick Carnes and John Bradshaw. Yet, for prepared survivors, and perhaps even more so for therapists, this is a good book to understand the wide variety of negative repercussions which result from abuse."
2,Dreadful production values,"This is a poor use of the DVD format - obviously just a copy from a video version. There are no DVD features, aside from chapter search. The production values are just awful - grainy, fuzzy, dark."
4,I would recommend it........,"I checked this book out of the library about two days ago... I finished and dropped it off yesterday. I would recommend this to anyone who feels at a lost when it comes to saving money......I am going to caution that if your credit card debt is already in collection some of his principles will be hard to follow to the letter... Bascailly he want the reader to go on a credit diet... use only 90%of the income pay instead of the full 100%....Personally I am in deep debt....however I have begun my journey to freedom by writing down all of my accounts,listing them in a large book which is divide into two. The first half is for account that will be paid off.... the second is for monthly payments such as rent,insurance and utilies..... I am reading several other books and taking notes.... once I begin to build my wealth account I will transfer some of the funds to a low risk investment..."
5,My Gift of Choice for New Cooks,"I must have purchased 50 Better Homes and Gardens cookbooks over the years as gifts for new cooks. Anyone who is graduating from college or getting married young receives one. This is my favorite edition. Suitably modern, yet wonderfully general. Where else can the witless burgeoning cook learn how long to boil an egg or bake a potato? Yet, as the skill of the user grows, the book accomodates. I myself am on my third copy as my heavy use tends to leave favorite recipes obliterated by gravy or important pages glued together with eggs...perhaps I should include a book stand in that gift box..."
5,Product was exactly as described,"I was looking for a used CD that played perfectly, and didn't mind a few dings and dents. It came in (the mail) exactly as described, right down to the drilled hole in the case, and on time. It's nice to know about the minor flaws of a used item before making a purchase, as well as not having any hidden surprises (e.g. a defect not mentioned). I only wish all purchases were this straightforward and honest!"
5,"Enchanting, and Rich as Butter","Keep an eye on Jody Seay. This woman's work is marvelous. There is something about the way she magically strings words together that makes you just proud to be a member of the human race! Let's hope we all hear much, much more from this wonderfully gifted writer."
1,Sick and Tired,"I'm really tired of people acting like the victim hada choice or made a desicion. If the suicide ended after a long battle with clinical depression then it is not the victim's fault. It is a disease. When people writing these books call it an intentional choice, it perpetuates the stigma of mental health and if it persists, we will forever be in the dark ages when in comes to mental health parity. I will always love my father. He was a great man and a great dad and he had an illness."
4,suicide recovery,This book is an intense look at the many phases of recovery after the suicide of a dearly loved one.
3,"Ok, no criticism","it's hard for me to differentiate such children's books from one to the other. They are all about the same to me; maybe the kids themselves are better judges, but my grandkids have nothing to say about any of them at this level."
1,"Run, do not walk, from buying this thing","This is a horrible MP3 player. I have a large number of MP3 files from different sources, most of them 128 to 192 kbps, and only about 20% of them play correctly. Invariably they will start skipping in midstream, in a very regular but rapidly increasing way, which seems like the codec or memory buffer is messed up rather than the disc being scratched. It even does this on pristine, newly burned discs. I picked this player up on impulse at Target, and based on the other reviews it looks like I should have done my homework first. I won't be buying any more RCA products until they work on their quality control a little more."
1,Doesn't Work,"Bought this to listen to CDs and MP3s at work. The MP3s skipped every 30-60 seconds. Some of my CDs played okay, mostly the newer ones. But others wouldn't play at all, spinning for a while, and then showing ""nd"" presumably for no disk. Other disks would play for awhile and then get fuzzy and ultimately end prematurely. I'm taking it back!"
4,P2P sharing produces a sale,I found this on Napster back in the day. Was pleasantly surprised to find it for sale almost a decade later. This sale is a direct result of P2P sharing.AND I like their music.
5,Awesome for Lenovo Thinkpad tablet stylus,AAAA batteries are so hard to come by nowadays. This was a great deal. I use them for the stylus on my Lenovo Thinkpad. The battery life is on par with top brands.
1,Not worth recycling,"Ms. Grace demonstrates her contempt for the United States Constitution and the American justice system in this self-aggrandizing diatribe. She criticizes what she perceives as ethical lapses of defense attorneys, but conveniently neglects those ethical violations for which she has been cited. We also get the usual sob story of the death of her fiance, which, indeed was tragic, but she seems incapable of moving on with her life. If you enjoy dirty tabloid-style name dropping, this one's for you!"
3,Media and money can win you a case.,"Nancy Grace host of her own show on CNN, a legal commentator on Court TV and a former prosecutor who never loss a case criticizes the criminal justice system including defense attorneys, judges, and juries. She also comments on controversial cases like Michael Jackson, Kobe Bryant, and Scout Peterson among others. She also suggests ways to reform the legal process to help victims of crime rather then criminals. Her book is factual and you can tell she has a zeal for justice. And I agree with almost everything she says in this book, especially that criminals should not profit from their convictions."
1,Loud and brash,"While I admire Nancy's energy I have to admit she wears me out fast. As does her new book. Barley 50 pages into it I was mentally exhausted and pulling my hair out. Everyone hates murderers Nancy. Not every situation needs to be handled with a jackhammer. That said, she's right about the justice system, it needs a fixin. Personally, I'm a huge Court TV fan and recently devoured Catherine Crier's new book on the Scott Peterson investigation. Unlike Nancy's book, Catherine points out there's plenty in our justice system worth saving. And Crier never needs to scream to get her point across"
1,Truly Awful Book from an Truly Awful Woman,"What she did to Casey Anthony was a Disgrace. She convicted this poor girl without a trial. She tore into Casey Anthony night after night with no let up. After she was proven Innocent did Nancy admit she wrong? No, Nancy is never wrong. In fact she tried to get people to lynch Casey . She is doing the same thing to George Zimmerman convicting him without a TRIAL. If anything happens to Anthony or Zimmerman Nancy should be held accountable. All she does is incite people that is her goal. This woman does not belong on the air."
5,Somebody who cares,Nancy Grace cares and has a true passion about victim's rights. This book has fire and explains how our criminal justice system has been stolen. Nancy Grace and Diane Clehane did an awesome job writing this book and I highly recommend anyone who is interested in America's courtrooms to read it.
1,I love Nancy Grace but sorry Nancy this book .....,"I dont know I couldnt finish it it was all over the place and I couldn't spend more than 20 minutes at a time reading it nor could I finish the book. Nancy Grace is # 1 on my list I dont miss her shows she is 1,000,000,000 stars on TV but this book well she had a publishing house helping her lets just say that. Sorry to give a bad review. The book jumps around from so many cases and what happened I mean on 2 pages 3 cases (approximately). Thank you but I will stick to your TV shows."
1,a chore to finish reading,"What a great idea for a book --- a murder mystery that takes place during the Second World War at the secret Los Alamos lab where the atomic bomb was developed and includes famous physicists in its plot. Too bad it fell apart so completely that my only motive for completing the book was to see if its plot was as lame as I suspected. Alas, it was. The author relies on the ""idiot plot,"" with the main character behaving like a dunce solely to advance the story and prevent a premature conclusion. Why waste time on a book where you can guess who dunnit simply by the introductory description of a character? Furthermore, the moralizing in the book is superficial and serves only to fill pages up with words."
3,Talented writer and negative stereotypes,"There is no denying that Joseph Kanon is a talented writer. But it should be noted that there is an undercurrent of homophobia running through his first novel, ""Los Alamos"". For instance, on page 135 of the first edition, in a supposedly humerous exchange, one of Kanon's characters contends that the only good 'fruit' is a dead 'fruit'. And the book abounds with gratuitous, derogatory references to 'queers'. ""Los Alamos"" encourages negative attitudes toward gays. Those who are uncomfortable with that would do well to skip the book. Those who don't find that off-putting will probably consider ""Los Alamos"" a good read"
4,Explosive romance and world events,"The philosophically chilling and personally poignant effects of one of the 20th century's most important scientific discoveries provides the background to an intricate mystery and passionate love affair. A little heavy in the communist conspiracy, but otherwise beautifully written."
2,interesting plot with no conclusion,"The premise had promise a murder of one of the people inviolved with the nations most secret project, the building of the first atomic bomb. The main thrust of the book is not the building or the interpersonal conflict that arise from the creation of the bomb, you learn nothing of it from the book. The point seems to be how often the main character can have sex with the wife of one of the bombs builders. Once the covert spying network is uncovered nothing happens. Great expectations, no delivery."
4,good book,"Kanon took one of the most interesting and fascinating event in modern american history and put a mystery in it, and then put a love story in that (which was probably the weakest sub-plot of the book). but i'd say it was more of an espionage story. kanon did an excellent job."
3,Neither Fish Nor Fowl,"I didn't find this book to be great as thriller or history. As romance it was boring: The characters didn't interest me that much, and their love affair was ho hum. I stuck with it because of the history and my increasing time investment. The funny thing is that Kanon is a pretty good writer, but the book is lengthy and somewhat tedious. It did inspire me enough to go out and buy Richard Rhode's Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb."" It promises to be more interesting."
3,Ok,I Never really got into this show but it had some gags that i liked Its Not As Funny And Pinky And The Brain Or Animaniacs But It Was A Little funny that i would watch it when nothing was on
5,Freakazoid Freakazoid Runs Around in Underwear,It really great to have the first season on DVD. I remember growing up watching Freakazoid as a kid and thinking it was the greatest thing ever. Now that I'm older I still think the show is amazing. It's got the most random humor that calls back to the likes of Monty Python and early SNL.I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes of making Freakazoid and now I understand the method to the madness that is Freakazoid.WARNING: You'll probably not like this if you can't stand irrelevant humor and/or complete and utter nonsense.
5,Must read for Marines and Vietnam buffs.,"Mr. Webb was among the first to tell of the war from the gritty, unglamorous viewpoint of the field Marine, the grunt. The book chronicles the operations of a rifle platoon operating in Vietnam at the height of the war, and the story circles around a young lieutenant who strives to survive and serve his rowdy band of drafted Marines while still completing the mission. Webb has an unusual writing style, but it works well within the story, especially the ""street"" style dialogue of the young combatants that depicts the manner in which Vietnam era Marines spoke. Unlike shelves of blase, feelgood snorers of military fiction out there, this book stands apart as one of the truly great war novels of all time. It is a must read for anyone who served or is currently serving."
5,College Senior,Best Vietnam book I've come across. Webb brings to the table insight and a style indicative of a man who has been there. I read this book after Robert Timberg's Nightengale Song and I must say that I was impressed.
4,It is pink ant it rings,"My daughter loves it! Well made and sounds good. Regardless of function, it is pink with hearts."
5,Jephte's Daughter,"This is a wonderful book, written by a very talented author. I have enjoyed Chiam Potok's books as well, as they also give me a glimpse into the Hassidic world.Near the end of the book I felt uncomfortable as the author began to deal with Christianity. I am a Christian and do not see my faith at all as the author described it. However, I read on, and really appreciated seeing how a Jewish person sees my faith. Very enlightening. I have also read The Saturday Wife, years ago, and did not realize till I was nearly finished that it was the same author. I will look for more of her books. I believe that to know the scriptures (both old and new testaments) gives added enjoyment to the reading of this book."
2,Good overview; too superficial if you're looking for theory.,"A good enough overview of some of the forces that are shaping our society. Rather than base her findings and especially forecasts on any visible data, much of the book is formulated as speculation. (""This is going to happen"", full stop.) I bought the book under the assumption that it might help me with a paper on how the Internet alters the perception of Distance in US and European culture... following some of Baudrillard's arguments. Well, no full-on theorizing in this book, neither the depth not the elegant style of (e.g.) Nick Negroponte or George P Landow... but if your favorite aunt is a moderately successful businesswoman who thinks computers _won't affect_ our culture & society, I suggest you give her the book as a present. david skreiner"
5,Feisty's Doggles,"My female Boston Terrier has protruding eyes that are subject to irritation from the wind and the sun. I got her a pair of Doggles, especially for use in our pool where she floats with me nearly everyday. She was initially a little ""concerned"" about wearing them but with short trial usage and encouragement, she is now very comfortable wearing them. The Doggles protect her eyes very well with foam padding around the rims. I've posted her picture on my Facebook page and have received so many comments about her goodlooking eyewear."
2,It does not look like an original Elizabeth Arden Product.,"I bought this product (Elizabeth Arden White Shoulders) a few weeks ago and it does not look like an original Product. The name ""Elizabeth Arden"" does not appears in the bottle and the fragance it's not the typical Elizabeth Arden one that i expect."
2,Small silver earrings,I received these earrings fro my teen daughter and they were very very small don't recommend them to any one.
2,Not the best,"If I could go back and not buy these I would. I should have listened to the reviews because they're right! I bought 6 pairs of these for my ears and thought I could put them in my lobe piercings and the other pair in my cartilage. Well I was wrong. The earrings were really hard to get clipped in the back so it took me over an hour to get 4 pairs in and they didn't fit in my cartilage at all. They were however the size I wanted for my ear. Another thing I noticed, about a week of wearing them the part that goes into your ear started to change color to an almost black color. Next time I'll listen. A few earrings also un clipped and I almost lost them."
2,Read the plays by all means - but get a different edition!,I have seen and used much better editions with much more easily understandable and useful annotations. Look around.
2,Got IRS Notice for 02 Underpayment of Taxes/delayed payment,"I have been using Turbo Tax product since 1997. Last year 2005 tax return after I had e-filed, I got an IRS notice/fine for underpayment of estimated tax. I payed this amount and wrote to Turbo Tax about their 100% Gurantee and interest, on any IRS fines. Nothing happened and I never got any money back. So if you depend on this claim, be sure you will not get anything back...or you will have to really run after it to get anything back. I tried contacting them through Online CHAT. The Support folks in India passed me on to 2 of their departments and finally asked me to contact Turbo Tax over phone. Forget it...not worth all the hasle. Next time may use a different product."
1,One Bad Sales Pitch,"This hour-long tape opens with five minutes of ads for the rest of the series and the appropriate websites (the producers don't expect you to settle for just one tape). Then the speaker, going on the assumption you know all about standard trading, doles out rhetoric about his personal definition of the term ""day trading,"" and it's all downhill from there. Yes, really.After watching this tape with an extremely bored friend, I gave it to another friend who had been short-term trading and wanted to get into day trading. She told me she'd found more real information at the tutorials of online brokerage sites, which are free, quick to read, and easily accessible to anyone.Unless you simply want the visual and financial shock of finding a cheap, poorly labeled, boring, rhetorical tape lying in the middle of an oversized, beautifully covered box, don't waste your money or an hour of your time on this one."
4,"Very helpful, even for health professionals","I recommend FORMULA FOR LIFE to my patients to help them adopt a more healthful lifestyle and get vital information on slowing down the aging process. That includes ways to prevent the aging of the skin, in which I, as a dermatologist, am particularly interested."
4,Clock,"It arrived on time. It made a great retirement gift, however it was a little pricey for what it was."
4,A GREAT INCOMPLETE CD,"This is truly an almost perfect cd that has all of randy travis's best material, but it is missing one song that was a hit and should have been in this collection , but for some reason it isn't , the song is 1982 . like I said this is an almost perfect cd that just lacks one song , and too me that is kind of a let down so I'll just have to give it 4 stars."
5,Fantastic Book for Photoshop,I Have been using photoshop for a few months now.This book is worth it's weight in GOLD.I have 6 Photoshop books and this is one of the best!
5,Excellent,This CD is excellent. We play it over and over and over. The music is melodic and meaningful. The singing is soothing and soft. Some of the songs will bring tears to your eyes.. i.e. please stay a baby just a little while.
4,Chalker at his hilarious best!,Chalker hits a high note with this one. Marge and Joe out in the absurd fantasy realm go from the frying pan and into the fire and back again! Transformations abound in this delightful spoof of every fantasy novel ever written!Beware the rules....and have a great time!
3,First track may not play completely,"At 5:19 on the first track, some players (even high end models) will just jump to the 2nd track rather than playing the entire 7:06 of the song. Universal claims this is a player issue (yea, sure). The player I have is a Sony ES5400 which retails for $1,500."
5,One of the greatest albums of the 1970's!,"This one reminds me of Prince's Sign O The Times because he tackles so many different genres and it's funky. Talking Book was a pretty album. Innervisions was a lot darker. I love listening to this all the way through, and I'll never forget hearing it for the first time."
2,Need a better method of shipping,Although these candies did have a very good flavor I was very disappointed. I had to dispose of almost half because the candies were crushed; I assumed it was poor packaging and didn't go through the hassle of trying to get them replaced. I just think it is probably something that needs to be purchased locally instead of by mail.
2,It wasn' t that great,"These cards were lame and they reminded me of a ""childish"" world. There is no color to the background!"
2,too tall,"I am 5'6"" and this chair is simply too tall. It does not lower as far as my previous chair. After just a few minutes, my neck and shoulder are in significant pain. I have to figure out how to raise not only my monitor but also the keyboard. I am opting for the cost and hassle of trying to adjust the other parts of my set up over the hassle and expense of trying to return the chair after putting it together.My desk is standard size but the keyboard tray is not adjustable. The arms of the chair won't go under the tray and even stacked on books the keyboard just isn't right. So after investing in an adjustable keyboard tray, removing the wooden one that comes with the desk and installing a new one, I hope to get a set up that works for me. Not happy."
3,Michael Manring on Bass,"Michael Manring plays a mellow fretless bass, making these relaxing tracks more interesting. Bonfield makes nice use of harmonics throughout, including on Duane Allman's 'Little Martha.'"
3,Looks great when assembled,But there was one problem--the pre-drilled screw holes were in the wrong places on both sides of one drawer. We had to re-drill them. And it was a lot of work to assemble it.
4,Easy to assemble,"I received the filing cabinet quickly for an item of its size and shipping needs. The assembly took me less then an hour, pretty great considering I'm without any helpful expertise in furniture assembly. It looks amazing, very clean and polished. In general I'm happy. The rails that hold the files have two different slots, for for standard and one for legal. This is a feature that I'm quite pleased with."
3,Serves it's purpose,"I am using the cabinet, but for the price it is really not worth it. Would have been better to buy real wood for this price."
3,"Heavy, difficult to assemble but nice looking",This set of drawers is very heavy -should be lifted by 2 people. It was difficult to assemble- pieces didn't fit easily into others. I found it a bit pricey for not loving it. It looks nice though buut perhaps not worth the price or trouble.
4,Just what our office needed!,"The file cabinet looks great. It has an attractive look that fits in with our home office. We bought it to replace an old metal file cabinet, and it is definitely an upgrade. Drawers are a little more shallow than our old cabinet, but it still holds all of our files with room to spare.Assembly took longer than expected. Also, package is too heavy for one person to move by themself."
4,File Cabinet,"It is beautiful, and holds a lot. However, it was tricky to put together. I would have given it five stars if it were easier to put together."
4,"too slick, but strong","This is a strong piece of plastic, which will likely protect my nano to the end. A couple issues:-It is a bit bulky, with a fat clip protruding out the back. Fortunately it is removable when you don't need it.-While clipped to my shorts, snapping the case back on the clip can be difficult--I generally have to reattach the clip to the case, then put the connected unit back on my shorts. I can't just snap on/snap off the case while the clip stays on my shorts, like a cell phone, or other ipod cases--You need to see what you're doing, it's not a tactile thing.-The rubber dial protector is a bit thick and too 'sticky' to the finger, making volume change a process, especially while jogging. I removed it--works fine. I use it with the Nike pedometer, no problems. It jogs well, stick tight to my shorts, does the job, can't go wrong with the purchase."
2,UGH,"The ending left me completely unsatisfied. Drabble spends the entire book developing these characters, yet the book ends with no sense of completion or closure."
1,Not good quality,"We purchased this greenhouse 2 years ago and loved it the first year. Unfortunately, the plastic covering started to wear and it dry rotted the second year. Additionally, the frame started to bend which caused stress on the zippered door which eventually tore. I would not recommend this product."
5,The Greatest Autograph Book I've Purchased!!,I love autographs and LOVE this book! I've purchased all the others and this one is by far the very best that I've tried. It's about time that collectors have a book where the addresses DO work! AWESOME BOOK!
4,Where's the classic Rockman?,"This should be five stars but Tom wanted to go with a heavy bass sound and hide the harmonies and layered crunch that everyone loves.Even if Brad isn't on the album,it could have been redeemed by altering the sound.It's the classic crunch that everyone loves.Tom says he wants the albums to sound different and I can see th point.Zeppelin did this on every album but they still rocked.These guys were great on this tour and these songs were equally great.Don't overlook ""I Need Your Love"" and the ""Walk On "" medley.Just the classic crunch would improve these songs so much."
1,No Brad = BAD,"Take Brad Delp out of the Boston sound and you have no Boston PERIOD. Fran Cosmo does a lack luster job at vocals...he's just not Brad Delp, he does not have the magical voice.""Walk On"" sucks, dont waste your time with this Delpless Dog Vomit."
1,pass this one up,"With Walk On coming out 8 years after Third Stage, a person would think that Tom Scholtz had more than enough time to write plenty of strong material for a new, but I guess not. Walk On is a total bomb. Boston is a great band, but with this album they really missed the mark. None of the songs make a lasting impression. Stick with the first three albums."
5,A Brilliant CD But It Missed Brad Delp !,"""Walk On"" is adeptly produced and engineered by Tom Scholz. Vocalist Fran Cosmo is great but this superlative CD started the full-blown implosion of Boston. Nonetheless,vintage and yearning songs emanated from the CD such as "" Surrender To Me"", LIvin For You"" and ""What's Your Name"". The Walk On Medley showcased Tom Scholz's guitar and keyboard virtuosity. A really fine CD. Fortunately, Brad Delp joined Boston for the ensuing ""Walk On Tour"". The concerts were captivating and long. The inner notes of the CD humanely condemn Domestic Abuse, Fur, Veal Crates and Hunting. Brad Delp was and Tom Scholz remains a humanitarian and animal welfare advocate who embraces many nonviolent causes."
3,"NEW SINGER, SAME GROUP","Boston's fourth cd, WALK ON, starts of rockin, and rockin harder than any other Boston cd before. The first four songs are some of their strongest too. But, after the title track, the cd quickly falls aaprt. Almost like a before and after picture you see of people, it's that much of a change. Lead singer Delp is missed, new comer Cosmos does a good job. His voice isn't as clear as Delp's, but it does have a more ""guttsy"" feel to it. Shame the last half of the cd almost ruined the whole cd."
5,An autobiography of the NBA'a best all-around player ...,"""Drive"" is the autobiograhy of Larry Bird, the NBA's best basketball player of all-time. This book shows readers what made Larry Bird the player that he was. His unselfish attitude, his ability to make the big plays, and how he made everyone around him a better player. There may have been better athletes, flashier players, but Larry Bird (if you consider every aspect of the game of basketball) is the best all-around basketball player of all-time."
2,"It's called organization, Larry","This book is great for any fan of Larry Bird. But, if you are not, you will become aggravated by reading this book. Grammatical errors and poor writing are littered throughout this entire book. Larry is my favorite athlete of all time, yet I still think he sounds like a moron in this book. Rich Garces is so good."
1,Condition,"This is definitely the book I needed, but was not happy with the condition it is in. It was not very expensive so it isn't a big deal, but I have bought other books from Amazon in used condition - listed as good, and they were in much better shape. This book has pages falling out, and smells and looks like it has been in a damp basement. I would have rather spent the extra five dollars and gotten the new copy."
3,Prompt delivery - DVD has 'grainyness' aspect to it,"Very prompt delivery. Case & DVD's in good condition.My only problem, & this may have nothing to do with the seller, is that, in 2 episodes the picture is rather grainy. The other episodes on the DVD were fine, so it could have been a mfg error. Regardless, keeping the product despite those 2 poorly visual episodes."
4,Excellent.,Would recommend to my friends. I am a Glades fan. Can't wait until Season 3 comes out on DVD. Enjoyed all episodes
4,The Glades season 2,"Great video quality and ease of access through Kindle Fire. I wish a video stream were capable without needing an internet connection. It is not as practical as reading a book on my regular Kindle, but I sure enjoy it"
4,i liked it,I enjoy this series and it's nice to review and rerun them from time to time. Even when the satillite goes out always got my DVD's
5,Phil Michelson: Secrets of the short game,"Excellent video. I have a good long game, but my short game is my weakness. After viewing this video for the first time, I practiced his tchnigques and ""got it."" I felt 100% more confident in my chipping, bunker shots and short game. Well worth the money."
2,Very Basic,I was disappointed when I viewed this DVD. There is nothing new or innovative with Phil's short game. The 2 DVD series is because you see the same thing he's demos over and over again. If you are a high handicaper you might get some benefit from the DVD series. For me there are better short game DVD's out there and this one was a waste of money.
4,Great skills,The DVD is great I have tried some of the skills and believe that it has help me in my short game.
4,Husband really enjoyed.,"My husband has watched most of this on TV on the public station and he really enjoyed it, so I got him his own copy to watch whenever he wants."
4,interesting and informative,"interesting to watch, as well as informative and educational. for anyone who may have had grandparents in WWII, you may learn a thing or two about what their experience was like.. and if not, you may just learn about some stuff you never knew before.."
5,Wonderful job.,Born in Waterbury Connecticut and seeing my Uncle and Dad deal with the War I found this wonderful documentary very moving.
5,"""The War"" by Ken Burns","This set of films is the best depiction of the horrors of WWII that I have seen. There is no Hollywood deception here! Everyone who desires to see the truth about this incredible period in history, must view this film!"
4,The War-Ken Burns,This was a Xmas gift for my husband and he claims that he is really enjoying it. Ken Burns does his usual excellent job.
5,Superior!,"This Ken Burns film will become a classic. Provides exception insight into to WWII and its destruction around the world. If you ever coined WWII the last ""romanic"" war, you won't again after watching this presentation."
1,The War....?,"..Or Ken Burns Liberal Slant view of History? The film is suppose to be about the war,yet over and over again we hear How bad the United States was.We hear about How Vicious war is(this is a Anti-War film it seems), Everyone with half a brain knows WAR is hell. It paints Generals and the military as incompetent and uses the same interviews from the same people from four different towns,especially some whiner lilly fruitcakes naggin' on and on.For a Younger Generation such as myself it is more of the same garbage being thrown at us from those on the left who want to indoctrinate much like the Nazi's and Communists."
4,war for your reading enjoyment,Ken Burns is one of my favorite producers of documentaries. In this film he has adhered to the highest standards of inegrity and faithfullness of one of our terrible national disasters.
4,A wonderful satire - great book for a reading group!,"Although you have to adjust to the pronoun reversal in the book (women=wym, men=menwym, history=herstory), I found it easy to get past this quirk and really enjoyed this book. I especially liked the fun that was poked at particular gender-specific activities: The traumatic rite of passage of buying a first bra is transformed into buying a first ""pehoe"" or penis cover; in hot weather, those with mammary glands are free to go about without a shirt, while those with hairy chests are forced to keep their clothes on; it takes hours to groom a beard and properly adorn it with beads and ribbons. These and other clever satirical twists make the book very effective in pointing out gender inequalities in our society. My reading group had a great time discussing this book."
2,Disappointed,This is a LIVE CD & the cover doesn't tell you that upfront. The songs are great but not if you want the original versions.
3,Be Prepared,"This CD should be labeled as ""Freddy Fender Live In A TexArkana Bar"". The recordings were definitely not of studio quality and preformers interact with patrons. It's not a bad CD as long as you are prepared for what it is."
2,Disapointed,I bought this router based on what I had heard about this product line. Nothing but good things...well I hope that changes because after gettign this expensive router home the adjustment has too much backlash for such a high end product and after I overcame that the router body drifts down with each consecutive pass. Afet all possible adjusments had been made the problem persisted. I am returning this router and sticking by my old steady Bosh and DeWalt.
5,Relax and dance at the same time.,Swayzak makes music that is deep and yet not very complicated. I've listened to the CD over and over and it doesn't seem to wear out though it's very minimalistic.Swayzak only play the right notes and makes it sound so easy to do. Turning the bass all the way up fulfills the pleasure.
4,This CD is for Grown Folks,This CD is a Jazz remix of popular Hip Hop Dance Songs. Only People with class can appreciate it. Lot of the work is done by Kim Waters and if you know their work and you like them you will like this CD.
5,An Excellent Parenting Resource,"This excellent book offers parents solutions to common problems, as well as tips for positive guidance and effective praise. The program seems to be designed to encourage parents to expand on their current parenting techniques, rather than abandoning current practices in favor of a ""new method."" It boosts parents' esteem as well as giving tips on how to boost children's self-esteem. It sits on my shelf next to ""1-2-3 Magic!"""
4,Good compilation CD,As any compilation CD there is good and not so good track on it.But none hardcore Reba fans I think this is great.
2,A simple parenting concept explained in lengthy way,It's not the easiest book to read and certainly too lengthy to explain a simple parenting concept. A lot of primitive stories and encounters in the book rather than the parenting sides of thing.Just not my style.
3,Hard to read,"The ideas are very challenging, but the book is very hard to be red for non-english reader! Verry hard to follow the plot"
5,SUPER T.V. BY SONY,"I just have to say this is a great product with great features if you purchase this you will love it as much as i do.I got this tv set as a gift from a relative It is one of the gratest gifts that I have recieved.This tv is loaded with faetures it has av inputs an s-video input a 3-line digital comb filter that provides crisp and clear picture quality.This little tv has great stereo sound too,and lets not forget that it is a flat screen t.v.(it has plenty more features also) I got this tv to hook up to my ps2 video game console,and when I hooked it up to my ps2 i was amazed by how good the games actually look.dvds also look great on this little sony set.This beauty is worth every penny you pay for it.Expect this tv to last years to come because it is made by the best electronics company in the world SONY."
2,Disappointing,"This cd would be great if it had about maybe 1/2 the songs. The individual songs are good, but most of them sound pretty much alike. The few selections from the 'bandit dance' genre are especially captivating, but even with those, after 3 songs I feel I've gotten the idea. Simply, I would've really liked more variety on this recording."
4,The product works as intended.,"The Q78 clips worked perfect for my Subaru Impreza WRX. They work exactly as intended. The only complaint I have is that it's not the best setup, since it does do a little skuffing to the factory molding. These clips did include anti abraisive strips, but they don't hold up if you're constantly taking them off and putting them back on like me.These worked for me."
5,"real characters, real humor, real treat!","If you are in the mood to read, there is no better way to spend an evening than with JQuinn. Her books are populated with the most interesting, funny, quirky people. ""Brighter..."" is brighter than most other books."
5,"Funny, great & charming!","this is not her best book, but this is also a great &must read book... I highly recommand everyone to read her books, including this one =)"
5,Awesome.....,"This book was one of the funniest I have ever read! I enjoyed it from the start. It was so awesome to read a book that was refreshing and funny throughout. There were moments of seriousness, but somehow I ended up laughing because of something that Charles and Ellie would do or say. Definitely a great book if you are looking for something that is not serious or dreary."
2,Too simplistic for me,"By the end of the first half of the book - I was ready for the ending. I didn't feel any chemistry between the two characters. I have read and enjoyed the books of Ms. Quinn', esp. The Duke and I, but this one was not up to snuff."
3,"Well, It's Not Offensive","That's about all I can say about this book. It had a few moments, but nothing to keep me interested through a whole book. I've read one of her other books and loved it. It's a good thing this wasn't the first of Ms. Quinn's books I've read because if it were, I never would have bought another."
5,Dear and glorious physician,"This is one of a kind pieces. You will enjoy reading this classic novel by Taylor Caldwell. Althogh it is a novel, you will find interesting historical details and the background of the time of Jesus and be able to look the biblical events from a different angle. I enjoyed reading this book very much."
4,Manly scent,"This has been one of my all time favorite colonges. Has a clean, fresh, non-overpowering scent. Great for everyday use. Lady's seem to love it's understated, yet definetly manly fragrance"
5,From here to Eternity,Eternity is one of my favoritesThe effect stays throughout the day - a very masculine aroma tooHighly recommended for days in the office and nights in the barWorth the investment!
1,"Be ware, this is a fake cologne!","I have worn Eternity for over 12 years. When I received this item, the packaging gave me suspicion especially with a cracked lid. To add more, the scent was clearly fake to my smell sense. When I compared it back-to-back with the original one that I had, I had a definite proof. I sent it back immediately. If I were you, I would look for the same item but with Amazon as the seller. The price was almost the same."
3,"Smells nice, goes away too quickly",Smells great when you spray it on but fades away really quickly. I like when I use a cologne for a while that my jacket starts to smell like it a bit at all times and that simply never happened :/Pros:*Good price*Smells goodCons:*Scent doesnt last
5,Eternity by Calvin Klein for Men at a great price!,Eternity by Calvin Klein for Men at a great price! My old standby. Product just what I was looking for.
4,B*n's 100?,"I kid you not, this stuff smells like B*n's 100 bug spray. Having said that, I'm now wearing some for the first time since it arrived in the mail yesterday, and once you get past the toxic overnotes, there is a pleasant odor as well. It has a piquant flighty flavor that dances in and out of the nostrils like Natalie Portman in Black Swan."
3,"Good stuff, but vibrates much","I bought this to get some relaxation around my neck. Basically, I'm a spinal cord injured person. First few days I used it with pillow without batteries in bed to stop snoring. It helped me have good sleep. Then I used it with batteries and discovered that it vibrated too much. Again, it doesn't stay put around the neck for vibration. It's noisy and you cannot hear TV sound.........."
2,uneven,"This pillow is not as comfortable as it sounds. Yes it is soft, but as far as the massage goes, it vibrates on only one side of the pillow and you will find yourself very often laying on the mechanism which is extremely uncomfortable. I highly recommend seeking a different product."
4,travel pillow review,"Very soft pillow and the massage feature is a nice bonus. It is a bit bulky for traveling - much bulkier than our other ""bucky"" pillow and takes up a lot of room in the carry-on bag. It also works well for a lower back massage for long plane trips."
2,Not what I expected,"I have also had the neck surgery with fusion, and bought this in order to relax the muscles and help get rid of the pain in my neck. I found it to be too noisy and the vibrating really irritated my eyes. It feels that it is under filled and doesn't give much support other than the round hard vibrator inside."
2,A sham,"I did review this book earlier. Somehow, my review dissappeared. Poor. Misleading. There is much better on the market."
3,"Speed-Reading the Easy Way; Howard Stephen Berg, Marcus Cony","NEW METHODS OVER LEARNING MEMORIZING AND READING IN SOFTWARE DOWNLOABLE OR BOOKS DOWNLOABLE FOR INTERNET,BUT AS LIVE IN MEXICO CITY DF,I THINK IS BETTER ELECTRONICS MAIL,iF IS POSSIBLE IN SPANISH IDIOM. THANKS"
2,Not Worth It,"This pen is expensive and I wouldn't consider buying it again. It doesn't stay on when you press the button, you have to keep your finger on it for the light to work. Not the happiest of buys!"
5,PERFECT,I work in an industrial environment and this little light holds up better than most. With it's compact size it fits well in my shirt pocket. it stands up to 100F+ with it's metal frame so I don't need to worry about it melting if I set it on a hot surface (although the batteries don't like it I'm sure). I lost one a while back and loved it enough to purchase another. You won't be disappointed with this little guy.
5,I bought one for my dermatologist,"I have several of these in varying colors, the red is for night flying, because it does not ruin one's night vision. Need I say more? The battery life is excellent, and the batteries are cheap (AAAA) if you plan ahead for your needs and find an internet wholesale source. The LED light is pure white and lasts 100,000 hrs, as compared tp the ""orange"" color of the light my dermatologist had been using (incandescent bulb disposable penlight). 3 AAAA batteries last about 60 hours (included).Chuck HarrisBaton Rouge, LA"
5,A great special purpose light,"This is an amazing light that will serve you well in special circumstances. It is a penlight, and as such, doesn't replace a regular flashlight. It does, however, have its uses. If I am traveling and think that if might be nice (but not necessary) to have a light, this one is perfect. It takes up almost no space and is bright with a fairly focused beam. At home it is a great light to illuminate tight spaces. I also like leaving it beside my bed in case I have a need for a little light but want to avoid brighter lights that might disturb my wife.This is not the kind of light you will use for extended periods of time. You use it for a moment or two at a time. Because of that, the batteries will last for quite a while. If you do need to replace them, you can open up a standard 9v battery and remove the AAAA batteries you will find inside of it."
5,The best of Ultimate Marvel,"In a nutshell, ""the Ultimates"" AKA the Ultimate Avengers is far and away the best of Marvel's Ultimate titles, as evidenced by its top-rating among all of Millar's books. Interestingly, it rates higher than his other Ultimate titles...I think in general the tone is the most adult and most serious of the Ultimate books - closer to the new Battlestar Galactica or Season 5 of 24 than than to its comic peers.While I liked Ultimate Fantastic Four, Ultimate X-men, etc - this is the standard bearer of the line - even if you don't follow the avengers, this is an easy to grasp title. And Volume 2 is far better than volume 1!"
4,Decent quality bungees!,"Good value, very useful for keeping my shade structure firmly secured to ground stakes. The winds at Burning Man are very unpredictable and it's important to keep your campsite securely latched down to the ground with rebar stakes (or at least really high quality tent stakes), especially anything that can catch the wind like a shade cloth.Not a big deal, but they had a really weird smell when I took them out of the bag. I aired them out and it wasn't as noticeable later.I had enough to share with other people in my camp if they needed some."
3,Gerber toilets cannot use a universal gasket,"Normally I do not have a problem with Fluidmaster products. Their ""universal"" claim had held up until I had to replace some parts on my Gerber toilet. I think the Gerber toilet is the only one (or one of very few) which needs a thicker gasket than normal. You will need to buy a gasket specifically made for Gerber toilets at a plumbing supply store (not Lowes or Home Depot). If you cannot find one there, you can order one on Korky.com."
3,"Good product, but not exactly universal","The Fluidmaster 400AK kit was very easy to install. However, the product description did not specify that the flapper portion only fit toilets with a 2"" flush hole. I had a 3"" and realized it was too small mid-way through the replacement. I had to purchase an additional 3"" flapper replacement (also by Fluidmaster) to pair with the 400AK kit in order to remedy my toilet problems. Thus far, I have been satisfied by my toilets quietness and seal."
5,Very nice inexpensive watch,I was looking for a watch that had both a digital and analog readout that was easy to read at a glance. Was expecting to pay alot more for a watch that looks this nice. The sync signal function was easy to set-up and it is always accurate because it syncs every night. I find myself re-setting all of the other clocks to the time on my watch because I know it is correct. Overall I would recommend this product.
1,Seller still had not shipped this,I needed this for a college class. I have Homework from this book this week and I ordered it 13 days ago/ When will this be shipped???????
2,Could have been better,"A mediocre treatment of a terrific subject. The capsule summaries have to be short, (or they wouldn't be capsules) but too often they fall flat, barely catching the essence of the film. Calling this book an ""Illustrated Guide"" is stretching the truth almost to the point of breaking. The illustrations are sparse, and aren't even from the cartoons themselves, but from advertisements for the films.It really pains me to be critical of the work, but there is enormous room for improvement. Raving over it might well discourage another author (or even the originals) from producing a better work."
2,Poor durability and good sound,"I am on my second unit. The first Boombox's left speaker channel went out. The current unit's locking mechanism broke, so I have a clamp holding the receiver in place. Also, the speaker baffle keeps popping out. The sound is good, but they are constructed poorly. I paid 100.00 new."
4,An Anime Classic,"Here it is. The series that started the Gundam tradition. Most people will complain and say that the animation is outdated and crummy, but they'll miss out on this classic. The animation is not too bad, but it's not the best. The animation for the Mobile Suits aren't too shabby, though I say the Zeong is a little flaky. The story is great and really pulls you in the Gundam universe. The audio, however, is the Achilles heel here. The characters voices' sound very strained at times and the music is just atrocious. Despite those 2 shortcomings, this is definitely worth checking out if you 've watched Gundam Wing to death."
2,Great Series....But....,"This is a great series, no question there. But thereNEEDS to be the Japanese language track. I honestly hopethese do not sell well and send an clear messageto the studio. I waited years and what do we have. A verypoor English dubbing that does not equal the Japanesequality. I have seen some question if there is a Japanesedigital track available. Yes yes and YES. They were releasehere in Japan (yes I live in Japan) but without Englishsubtitles, so either way I am out of luck. Studio, thinktwice next time!!! This is Anime!!!"
4,not english mothertongue,"it is really nice to see gundam in my dvd player, but since I am not english mothertongue I would have appreciated english subtitles to allow me to understand the dialogues better.I wish that my suggestion will be considered if there will be other releases."
2,There was something there...,"A fairly good cast in an kinda okay movie. Some good scattered moments. Near the end when the cop say, ""They let him out,"" and Christina says she's going home...Shut off the movie. One of those tacked on, maybe they'll be a sequel endings that wasn't needed."
2,Worth watching... once... when you're bored.,"This movie was not as bad as some reviews claim. I picked it up as a rental because I wanted a simple thriller type movie to lose myself in for an hour and a half. To be mildly entertained... I got just that. Nothing deep or great. The characters were a bit cliche and the ending was pretty cheesy. But that's the point, eh? Miss Lange was cute and managed the distressed horror-film-female role, but I also liked that she had a tough personality. Instead of running and screaming (then falling and looking back like they always do), she faced her fears- throughout the movie. I also thought the mother character was pretty neat, her scenes made the movie interesting. And of course, the ending left it open for a sequal. Of course."
5,Persuasive Writes with a Capital P!,"Twisting Arms is an excellent source for teaching middle school students to write a thesis statement and had many resources on how to teach rebuttal and what is an effective piece of evidence not just ""Because you Said So!"" Make sure you check out the list of 75 creative topics that are listed for the kids to choose from to write. they will want to write more than one paper. No twisting their arms!"
1,Putco 402404 Cover,"The product Putco 402404 Chrome Hinge Cover. The purchased product does not have the word ""CHEROKEE"", as well as is shown in the photo published. This completely smooth without the word. I do not agree with that product."
2,"Some humor, but not enough to carry the book.","Caroline Trent has 6 weeks until her 21st birthday and she receives her inheritance. She must escape her greedy guardian, who is trying to get her fortune by having his son compromise and marry her. As Caroline is trying to find a place to hide out, she is mistaken as a spy by the dashing Blake Ravenscroft. Blake is on his last mission as an agent of the war office. He is plagued by the memories of his fiancee(also a spy) who lost her life while taking his place on an assignment.Julia Quinn is an author who is known for weaving humor into her plots. While To Catch An Heiress does have some laugh out loud moments, they're not enough to carry the book. I have to agree with the previous reviews that the dead fiancee was definitely a downer. She was also hard to get around-she was made mention of throughout the book. I never believed that Blake deserved Caroline or that she would want him. This book should be passed by. Read How to Marry A Marquis instead."
2,Not Quinn's best work,"Thankfully, Julia Quinn's plot & character development have improved since this 1998 novel. If you're seeking an engaging, well-written story like ""The Duke And I,"" you'll be somewhat disappointed here -- the hero spends 90% of the book bickering with the heroine. Even his best friend becomes so annoyed with the endless sparring that he leaves the area...imagine how the reader feels. Granted, even this effort is more entertaining than many other romances on the market. Quinn has become a compelling, amusing, enjoyable writer since ""Heiress"" -- any of her stories about the Bridgerton siblings are more deserving of your time."
3,feel free to skip this one,"As a huge fan of Julia Quinn, I picked up this book out of sheer boredom and a desire for a light, entertaining read. Since this is one of her earlier works, I wasn't expecting the quality of the Bridgerton series. Overall, I wasn't extremely impressed or disappointed. The hero and heroine are sometimes funny and sometimes annoying and far lacking the depth of Colin and Penelope (of Romancing Mr. Bridgerton). Their personalities seem a little slapdash at times--Blake was about the least convincing spy I've ever seen. However, the plot moves fairly quickly and the secondary characters are, of course, delightful (JQ's specialty, I think). If you can pick up this book for a bargain and want a qucik diversion, go for it. Otherwise, wait for Francesca's story (JQ seems to be getting better with every novel)."
5,The Rosetta Stone for the new century.,"Time has changed. The world has changed. We have changed. Rosabeth Moss Kanter once again takes the fear out of change and all that it means to our workaday world. EVOLVE! is an insightful, lucid, and often humorous examination of our spinning, changing world. Through the lens of her insight, huge concepts come into sharp focus and otherwise unwieldy conceits are rendered accessible and, more important, meaningful. A flawless, exciting and inspiring book."
4,Faithful adaptation from screenplay,"Gram did a good job, with a merit: the book is fast-paced, well written, very joyful to read. I'm happy with it."
4,A very well researched and interesting book,"I found this book to be one of the better entries in the trivia class. It is well written, contains interesting facts, and is well researched. It was certainly worth the asking price. It is a nice addition to my trivia library. So why can't I say wow? Well, like most trivia books, it contains all the right things, and is put in the right tense and definition, but is laking that something extra to make it a great book and a work of art and treasure."
2,Good info but VERY POORLY MADE movie,"It was so boring and tedious to sit through. It was agony and torture to endure the slow-moving pace of the scenes in order to get the information for which I watched the movie in the first place. Don't know HOW on earth that other reviewer said he watched it AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME. Some good points are made, interesting tidbits brought forth but be prepared to fall asleep on your way to hearing them."
1,Cover art is accurate...,"The message is good, though obvious to anyone with half a brain, ""junk food is bad"". The execution is horrible.I won't point out how the experiment is flawed. You can read numerous reviews that do this.The title of my review is ""Cover art is accurate"" for a reason. I found it repulsive to watch this guy eat. He smacks loudly, chews with his mouth open, and talks with his mouth full throughout the movie. One would have thought that someone on his production team would have tought him some manners. I guess not."
3,Sweet land of liberty!!!,"I get it; as a matter of fact, we all get it, you're not supposed to eat fast food all the time. And I really don't think anyone can! Personally, I loved this movie, but I don't think it had a realistic premise. We all know fast food is a bad diet choice. Unfortunately; the hectic schedule faced by most working Americans these days has elevated the viability of the fast food diet. So it's not surprising that Mr. Spurlock got sick following McDonalds dietary lead. What was alarming though was the rate at which Mr. Spurlock's body started to deteriorate; his doctor was visibly shaken and that's scary. And although this may not be a scientific analysis, there seems to be a direct correlation between busy lives, sleep deprivation, fast food and obesity. In the end, Super Size Me is fun to watch and if you read Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and/or watch Super Size Me, or both, you may never eat a happy meal again. You've been warned!"
3,fast food is terrible but great tasting,The movie shows how america depends on fast food not only in one way. Were all lazy at times but that doesnt mean we have 2 depend on fast food everyday.
5,very good,"very informative documentary, I'll never eat McDonald's again and neither will my kid, I can't believe the government allows so garbage to be put in our food."
1,Dishonesty at it's best!,"The fervor with which people create dishonest ""documentaries"" like this is just incredible to me. That he would pack so much BS into this to scare the public is just insanity. Most people lack the critical thinking or life experiences to see thru his veil of lies.He did not just supersize his meals. Most of the meals he would take away two cups of something. It stands to reason that one cup was a soft drink and the other a large shake. You can also see him eating many sundaes.To someone who has not had food allergies, you might not recognize that his chest pain and vomitting are signs of a food allergy. Also, if you are allergic to foods, your body reacts to them much like poison, so your liver is going to work overtime to get them out of your system. I would expect the doctors to have told him that. If not, they are not very good doctors. If they did tell him that, then he editted that bit of information out of the movie."
1,OH MY GOD!!!,"Why didnt anyone tell me that McDonalds was bad for you??? THANK YOU for making this documentary, I would have been lost without it! I thought the love handles came from something I was doing wrong, but now, thanks to Mr. Spurlock, I realize that I am not to blame for anything. I must say, it feels good knowing that nothing is my fault, and that large corporations are to blame for everything."
3,debilitating,"Interesting take on McDonald's and the fast food industry. While not exactly a scientific study, the writer, director and star, Morgan Spurlock eats McDonald's every day for every meal for a month and suffers some nearly debilitating consequences. His doctors fear for his safety and advise him to stop his McD habit at once. Spurlock discusses American eating habits and school lunch programs and the lack of nutritional choice widely available, asking why aren't some of these companies taking more responsibility (even if people should take more of the responsibility for what they eat as well). This is an entertaining and engaging documentary."
5,Supersize Me,"I had 2 different orders with this product. One was for a single DVD, the other was for 5 of these DVDs. SO I don't know which order I'm reviewing right now. Both orders came in sealed wrapping. I haven't watched any of them, because they are for prizes in a life-style change program. The program is CHIP (Coronary Health Improvement Project). They came in record time. Thank You."
1,Super Size Me,The DVD condition was perfect; the film was a documentary about fast-food restaurants. I watched the first few minutes and that was all I could stand. Guess it's good to wake folks up to the damages fast food can do to the body.
1,Don't eat if you're not hungry.,"That's the lesson that we SHOULD be taking from this ridiculous exercise. If I eat a Big Mac and large fries at McDonalds I won't be hungry for the rest of the day. Why on Earth would you eat that much 3 times a day? This guy had to force himself to eat, so obviously he wasn't hungry, so obviously he wouldn't have eaten this much if he wasn't trying to prove a point, so obviously his point has no validity."
4,Very Good!,"I thought this was a very good, entertaining and informative documentary. Morgan does an outstanding job of putting all this together and also of being the guinea pig for his little experiment. I laughed over and over when he started the 'project' and vomitted out the window after eating way too much at the McD's drive thru. I am almost laughing right now just thinking of how bloated and awful he looked and must have felt right before he threw up and his girlfriend and the cameraman laughing but also feeling sorry for him at the same time. Also his speedo's during the weigh ins were hilarious. This was a well done, well thought out documentary and I think Spurlock is a heck of a film maker.Check it out and you will never look at fast food the same way again!"
4,Common Sense?,"I have read some other reviews of this movie and a few people have stated that it is common sense that fast food is bad for you. If that is the case, what are we so fat, obese, and obsessed with food? Do we just not care what we our doing to ourselves? Of course everyone knows that fast food is bad for you, but do we know just how bad it is? People should not always assume that they know everything and just admit that we are not as smart as we think we are, if we are so smart why is Bush the president of the united states and why will he probably win the next election?"
5,Super Size Me,"This is a great movie and the message needs to be out there.Never go to mcdonalds ever again !The whole film is very well done and definitely the ending made it all clear.Who would you rather see go first us or them ? So simple Its THEM !Ronald Mcdonald 1952-2012 , Really like to see that happen and go out of bussiness."
3,A little hard to swallow,"I can't say I didn't like this film. It made some very excellent points and presented the facts in a fun and entertaining way. However, I found the subject of the experiment (Morgan Spurlock), and a good deal of people that surrounded him throughout the film, to be rather unlikable. There seemed to be very little sincere feeling, short of nausea, throughout the entire picture. Mr. Spurlock came off as rather snide, disingenuous, sanctimonious and self-serving. Frankly, I got sick of him faster than he got sick. But I am sure, after the success of this film, he will probably spend the rest of his life trying to live up to it or repeat it's success over and over again and, well, that's just sad. Better to nourish yourself on the fine documentary work of Michael Moore. He may be fatter, but at least there's something inside and he gives you something to chew on."
1,Not worth it,"When I first saw this movie I knew what I was going to see, but I was excited nonetheless to see comedy and to see what points he makes. I was disappointed. It wasn't funny. It was stupid throw-up, look down on people and other forms of vulgarity humor. It wasn't anything witty. Second, he claims he wants to talk about McDonalds AND individual responsibility. However, the whole film is about corporations, mainly McDonalds and a couple of others. Every once in a while he will say that he values individual choice and responsibility as well. But it is clear the only reason he throws that in is so that he can claim it isn't an anti-corporation, anti-McDonalds film. Rent it, don't buy it."
1,"Self-indulgent, attention-getting fluff","A filmmaker decides to further his career by supposedly doing a public service and ""exposes"" the ""dangers"" of the fast-food industry. Anybody who eats at McDonald's for a month should expect to gain weight. DUH!!!! Hello, dude, people who eat fast-food aren't looking to eat healthy. He got his wish though - now he's famous and the food police are ruining Big Macs for everyone. Don't waste your time"
5,the real and the whole truth,"super size me is a great dvd to watch and rightfully demonstrates that a diet rich in junk food like big macs and french fries are high in saturated fats and will lead to a rise in cholesterol and lipids and ultimately lead to obesity,diabetes and coronary artery disease.i suggest all viewers to cut down on junk food like big macs and imbibe a healthy diet to remain in perfect health.a good watch."
1,No merchandise,I cannot write a review for this item because the DEADBEAT seller never sent it to me and I'm currently waiting on a refund. This whole experience has left a really bad taste in my mouth.
5,face the facts,"I was hanging in NYC back in 2000. I was at the CMJ festival. I was checking out this new band called Freeheat. I noticed they sounded a lot like Jesus and the Mary Chain. The lead singer looked like Jim Reid. Hey! It was he. Later I was talking to Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre. Apparently he was at the show too. He felt like that they were too much like JAMC. There were other bands around like Spiritualized and Lupine Howl who had moved on. Freeheat is like JAMC JR. There are some live tracks and some studio stuff. This band has been around for eight years but they haven't released many records. Most of this material comes from a show in 2004. Some of those live songs like ""What Goes Around"" and ""Facing Up To The Facts"" are excellent. ""Get On Home"" is cool studio track. Some songs are doubled. That's okay. It's a schizophrenic record. Fans of Jim Reid should like this record. It's good to have Freeheat still around. I am burning up."
3,I have to be realistic here,"I love the Mary Chain, I love all their albums, but Freeheat just hasn't delevered. They released the same EP twice, and then This comes out what almost 6 years after. the Studio songs are great, the live stuff is so-so but truth be told, the bass line sounds the same on most of the songs. the ""Dead End Kids"" single is great and the single he did with Sister Vanilla is way more satisfying. I like the album don't get me wrong, But I would like to see Jim sit down and make an album, not a song here and there when it hits him and then put a bunch of filler together to make and album.In the end it sounds alot like rehashes of MUNKI and the thing that made the Mary Chain great was that every album sounded different from the last."
1,Yawn! Cringe!!,"This movie has very little going for it over all. Despite an attempt at some swish production techniques, ""Sasquatch Gang"" (released outside the USA as ""Sasquatch Dumpling Gang"") mostly just bumbles along from one crude slap-stick scene to another, with some truly cringe-making and juvenile dialogue making the whole production ultimately more embarrassing than funny. The movie's one clever feature, which aims to provide some structure and story-line interlinking, fails to work too, largely owing to the fact that the film has no real story-lines to connect! There are a couple of amusing moments, but I for one certainly didn't find it worth sitting through the other 80 tedious minutes to find them."
3,Interesting and soulful,"This movie has to thinking the entire time, At points you get a little lost, but all in all it is a fun movie"
1,Elton John's Christmas Party,I did not like this at all. I expected Elton John to sing but even so I can not believe he likes this kind of music. I hated it.
2,Disappointing,Very basic material. I was looking for something with more specific techniques and new approaches to life insurance selling.
4,Tongue Firmly Planted In Cheek......Then.....Chopped Off!!!,Slasher film from the Eighties...with humor as a side dish. Delightfully conceived and ardently executed (along with several students)...you will find yourself slyly amused and asking if Brad Pitt could ever have been that young and in need of acting lessons! The real stars of the movie carry it well with Martin Mull and Roddy McDowall taking kudos for scene stealing. This movie had it's own self-deprecating humor woven in and I for one think it is a perfect sendup of the genre and a clever beginning for Brad's career. That is...for those of you who remember who he was before he became the male side of Brangelina.
1,Pick a different Simon!,"This recording was appallingly poorly done. Other reviewers are singing the opera's praises, with which I agree, but this recording specifically was impossible to listen to. There was so much noise on top of the actual music that I couldn't hear the opera. I fully regret my purchase, but would not foist it upon anyone else either. I was looking for something affordable to prepare to see the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD Broadcast with Placido Domingo in the title role, and I was sorely disappointed. Affordable does not always mean adequate!"
4,A PLEASURE TO READ,"I really enjoyed reading this story, it also reminded me of the movie (The Sound Of Music, The Captain and The Nun),which is BTWone of my favorite movies. Eloise And Peril's story was warm & funny and touching, I actually LOL in the first chapter. I gave this book 4 stars and not 5 stars because I felt there could havebeen alittle more Love scenes (wink,wink, you know what I mean.)"
5,"A sublime, lyrical work!","Welty's, The Optimist's Daughter, is a gorgeously written novella! In compact, stunningly written prose, Welty tells the story of the passing of a small town Southern judge, and the ensuing conflict between his patrician, well-bred daughter and his tacky, hard-scrabble second wife. Welty does not sound one wrong note in this dead-on depiction of Southern life during this era. Welty's writing itself, as well as its insights into the pinnacles and the depths of the human condition, is stupendous. She absolutely deserved the Pulitzer for this work! My absolutely favorite book, ever!"
2,None too Optimistic,"I read this book in a couple hours and was sorely dissappointed. I found myself identifying more with Fay (mother in law of the main character) by wanting her in the story much more than she was because of me feeling she had every right to react and feel as she did. In most of the book, she was just pretty much around in a negative way, and her grief didn't help any. Just didn't get much from a typical story in that we all have relatives (in laws) who can be as unnerving (even in death) as those in the story. The ending was pretty much an ""I'm running out of storyline so I need pack it in with a typical see the world"" type ending."
2,Was Fay misunderstood?,"I have to admit that I did not enjoy the book and read it very quickly. I can't stop thinking about it though and that makes me think I need to re-read it. I didn't see Fay in the negative way that most reviewers did. When Fay ""abused"" the judge I agreed with her. Keeping him immobile in that bed was killing him and he was losing the will to live. She was right to try to wake him up. Laurel and the townspeple irritated me far more than Fay. Does anyone else agree that Fay was not as one dimensional as she seemed and had an honesty and realism about her?"
4,Love it,"It is more rough than my last sisal rug, but it doesn't bother me at all. Its very well put together, its definitely a quality rug. I love it"
1,No good for fluorescents,"Only for standard bulbs, not for compact fluorescent bulbs, should be stated more clearly this doesn't support CFB."
2,Works - barely,"I wouldn't recommend it. Installed in a partially finished basement. The lights are more dim and flicker, but I am sure I followed the directions correctly. The switch does turn on and off properly. The switch looks like a normal light switch, but the switch does not switch between up and down when turned on and off. You can push up to turn it on as many times in a row as you like. The rocker returns the physical switch to the middle, but the light stays on until pushed down to turn off."
2,a waste of time and money.,"A Japan-only release, this is a remix album based on The Private Press. It's all over the place; there are bizarre choices like the rock guitar in ""Six Days (Soulwax Mix)"" or Mos Def rapping over a different and unspecified version of ""Six Days"", semi-interesting novelties like an extended version of ""Walkie Talkie"", and truly bad ideas like the U.N.K.L.E. remix of ""GDMFSOB"" with Roots Manuva on the mic. I mean, who wants a crappy trance-rap remix of a DJ Shadow song? Freakin' nobody. This thing was just a bad idea. If you think this music is fantastic, chances are you won't really enjoy DJ Shadow."
1,Jessie Goes to America,This book is about a girl. She is 13. She is going to America She likes a boy named Lou. she learns to sew. she is pretty. She has a grandmother. she is nice. she is cool.
4,"This is what I look for in an ""independent"" movie!","When I think of an independent movie, the operative word for me is ""independent.""The movie, CHANNELS, is just that. And it is imaginatively very good. Watching a movie with an original voice, while observing some very fine actors such as our leads, Nat Christian and Kim Oja, along with Ed Asner, Taylor Negron, John Kassir and Joan Van Ark, is truly a joy.Christian and Oja are a great pair. He is so compellingly real and natural, that you think the camera just peeked in on him. She is engaging as well with a delightfully reserved charm.Christian is also the writer and director of CHANNELS. He brews poignant thoughts and some laughs, beautifully and skillfully wrapped to open for an enjoyable watch.The romantic look of the movie is helped by cinematography (Michael Hardwick). production design (Dolores Piazza) and visual effects (Duane Condor).There are several very funny scenes in the movie.I hope to see more from Christian."
4,"Fine story, of mice or men?","Don't we all drop those little thingsand misplace the scissors?So who is taking these things?Wee people or pack rats maybe?The story is the edge a fantasy and the hopeof little girls to find real people the size of dolls.We are all hoping that the mean old rat catchers of the world come up dry of little people!The writing is very good and the storygets you going. I like this one very muchlike the story of Ben Franklin with a mouse in his pocketwho was the real inventor? Tales talking animalsand here,little people will always please the young."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!!,worst book l have ever read. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.very babyish. weird names. best suited for children ages 2-5.if you want a good book try Wings.
1,It's not okay to steal...,"and this book sends the message that it is. Borrowers don't ""borrow"" things; they steal them. This book teaches kids that, as long as you don't get caught, taking things that don't belong to you is a-okay. Being ""seen"" is, after all, the only thing that Borrowers worry about."
5,"""Tiny Borrowing Peeps""","This story takes place around the 1860's Leighton Buzzard,Bedford Shire in Great-AuntSophy's manor, in the kitchen under the floorboards. That's where most the story takes place.This book is mostly about the Clock Family Pod (father), Homily (mother), and Arrietty (daughter). A boy, ""Human Beans"" as they say (a human boy).In my opinion I liked this book a lot because of all the fiction and fantasy.I would recommend this book because it's fictional a lot of fantasy and at the end it makes you eager to find out what happens after the book has come to it's end. If you like fiction and fantasy this is a great book to read!!"
1,Don't buy,I ordered this item twice and they keep sending the Foot Wrap. If you order from Amazon you are rolling the dice.
1,don't waste your money,"i found this scale to be very hard to read, even with the large dial, if you aren't right on one of the numerals, and very inaccurate. i just went to the doctor yesterday and found out that i weigh 7 lbs less than the taylor was telling me. if you get off and on several times you will see that it reads something different every time.i wouldn't buy this if i were you. i see there are good and bad reviews. too iffy in my estimation.amazon made me give it a star before it would accept my reveiw, otherwise i wouldn't even give it one. it's useless to me."
2,Should you buy it? Depends,"For the needle on this scale to point to zero, it must be turned to a 45-degree angle. So, if you can stand at a 45-degree angle, this is the scale for you."
2,Plays great.. doesn't last,Bought this for my daughter.. she loved it and used it every day.. Crapped out after 14 months.. Do they build these things just to last the warranty period?
2,Disappointed,"I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on Amamzon that the Monster A IP FM-CH 200 iCarPlay would perform well. However, even though the auto scan feature worked flawlwessly, the overall sound quality forced me to return the product for a refund. The trouble is twofold: the bass is very ""boomy"" and the highs (cymbals, high guitar, high vocals, etc.) are ""scratchy"" as if listening to a worn LP. This happens at any frequency I chose.This was my first purchase of an FM transmitter and it seems from reading the reviews that they all have issues. Can someone tell if there is an FM transmitter sold that really works well?"
2,Not as good as I thought,"I had the older version of Moster FM for iPod. It failed after 5 years. I got this as a replacement. However, it is disappointment.(1) Sounds worse than the older version from the car radio;(2) it fails in the middle and I have to unplug to restore it;(3) when it is plugged, it plays automatically (which is fine but not prefer); however, it didn't stop if I unplug or stop the engine. This cause my iPod to play even after I left the car. The old one worked the other way around.(4) Don't even want to mention the auto scan, it suck. I can pick a better station than it does.Bad news:(5) It won't charge iPod Touch, iPhone, and new gen of iPod Nano"
2,Random cutoff's blast you with static!!,"While listening to my iPod the unit will cut off, and I am blasted by static from the station that I am tuned to. I have only intermittently been able to reset the unit using the button; most often I have to unplug the power adapter from the car and plug it back in before it will reset.Caveta: This is my first transmitter purchase so I don't know if the behavior is normal to transmitters or if my area (Honolulu) is prone to this problem. But regardless, the fact is that this unit cuts off completely, blasts me with static (loudly) since the volume has to be turned up louder than a regular FM station would be.I would not recommend this product. The auto-scan feature is gimmicky and the sequence for setting the menu presets is non-intuitive (i.e. press a button, press another button, hold one down for 3 seconds, press another button). There's only 3 buttons and I couldn't remember the sequence, no matter how hard I have tried."
1,works ok... but...,This sounds fine - it's clear etc.... rarely static... however... I have a case for my ipod.. the connector stays connected most of the time.. but you bump it and it comes out... it's not made for an ipod with a case...My friend has the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod --- He was two cars ahead of me on the same station and his music over took mine... so I had to go with the plus....
4,Works good but not with 4th gen Ipod Nano,"I got this and found out it does not charge the latest 4th gen Ipod nano but the sound part works, My daughter has a 2nd gen ipod and she is going to use it because it works with hers."
1,Substandard reprint,"This 50th-anniversary reprint does Eliot Porter's legacy a real disservice. The reproduction of the original photos doesn't come close to their original sharpness, detail, and subtle color relationships. Given Porter's exacting standards, he never would have approved the mess that is presented here. These photos bear little resemblance to the originals, and communicate none of Eliot Porter's unique vision. I only wish Amazon offered the option of rating items a zero; I don't even want to give this one star!"
5,There is hope,"I thought this book was wonderful. After I finished it, I went back and read chunks of it over and over again. I have read other reviews on this site and some readers have said that some of the characters weren't fully developed, and they look at it as a bad thing. I, on the other hand, feel as though the Gigi did an excellent job and that the characters who weren't the most developed were the ones who fell to the wayside and weren't that important. They were only in the Amanda's life for a season...not a lifetime, unlike Gabriel and James.It was a well-thought out, feel good read. Reassuring us all that pure, unrequitted, enduring love still does exist...even if only in books."
4,"Very Real Life, Very Touching","This book had many hardcore aspects to it. The main character had to deal with love, lust, a drug dealing brother, and her brother's unloved son. Although the characters weren't developed very well, these situations were extremely clear to me.I love how the book starts off in the 90's/00's, and then goes back to the eighties to explain everything, and then goes back to the present to conclude it. Anyone who reads this book will be anxious to finish it, wondering what is going to happen next and what will happen to each of the characters."
4,Pulp Fantastic,"Very enjoyable set of short stories. The imagery and atmosphere are superb and really draw you in. The stories themselves are centered around characters fulfilling one machismo fantasy after another, which may sound off-putting but in reality is a pleasurable treat. The writer has an odd tendency to use an unusual word and then repeat it again a few times within a few paragraphs. Does anyone else notice this or am I just obsessive?"
4,Very gooding fantasy writing!,"In Brazil they butchered this edition (subtracting some stories), but it's still a great read."
4,Classic tales by a great storyteller..,"A great volume of classic pulp fantasy. The stories(many of them unpublished for many years) crackle with the energy and violence of RE Howards creation. Gloriously pulply, these are not the later pastiches of Sprauge and Decamp or the Marvel Comics Conan..this is the original Conan who lives by his sword and wits, and who lives for the moment.Nice little extras such as miscellenia, maps and comments by the editor make this a great read for any fan of heroic fantasy or great storyteling."
1,Too Many Parts,My son just pulls off the splash guard and wont stay on the chair. I hate the way the seat comes off and it doesn't slip back in well. My son just wants to take it apart all the time anyway and tries to sit on it without the seat. The high five thing doesn't really help and he just bumps it with is leg anyway. My son just likes the fact that it's elmo but he doesn't sit on it.
5,So sweet and adorable your teeth will ache!,This is a very cute performance by a group of cats that are animated to look as if they are singing Christmas Carols. Each cat's meow has been sampled and each sings its own note. The cats' meows are accompanied by various forms of synthesizer music. It is a fun and funny way to listen to the sounds of Christmas.
4,Good Collection of their best songs,"Mana is probably the best latin rock out there, and this CD has several of their greatest hits."
3,Worth $11,"This watch looks pretty decent. I have worn it in the shower and washing dishes and have seen no water damage. However, there is no doubt it is not an expensive watch. It is very light weight, almost has the feel that it came out of a gumball machine. Basically, this has the appearance of a simple Fossil or Relic watch for about a 6th of the cost."
1,A dangerious misconception of Being,"Kudos to the translator for making the effort; certainly Heidegger isn't an everyday walk in the park. However, the difficulty in reading Heidegger's work is absolutely essential to fully Understanding how the inquery into Being is to be conducted. This recent translation lends too easily to the science of psychology, and is, hence, antithetical to the originality of Heideggerian 'brand' humanism. The profundity of ""being and time"" is to be discovered by the individual, by his own means; to use public language obliterates any hope of this."
2,Not what I expected...,I purchase this outfit for my 4 yr old daughter to wear at her big sisters CHEER competitions. The colors match the school colors. The picture makes it look as though it is more fitted through the mid-section. It sort of just hangs very loose and looks frumpy. The turtle neck is short so you will always have to wear it under something. I washed it on cold but the colors faded a lot from just one wash. Great for pretend play but not worth the price.
1,"Wait, don't buy this set","Love Farscape, hate the publisher ADV. They are releasing these disks as a special edition and charging much less. Found I could get all of Season One on three DVD's for about half the price of this set. If you want Farscape, show a little patience and you'll get a better, cheaper product. Let the publisher shoot themselves in the foot, instead of getting you."
1,Wrong,The episode description is inaccurate and needs to be corrected. This episode has Crichton and others going back in time at a memorial and changing the timeline in a negative way.
1,God's Love,I was disappointed in in this book. I expected a more thorough presentation of the psalms and a more in depth look. I found it pretty useless for what I was looking.
4,Necessary viewing,"As someone who watched it when it was first broadcast, and again recently, I still find it an enthralling documentary. It's a pity other reviewers have concentrated on the lack of both gee-whizz computer graphics and sound-effects, but they should realise that it was made in a not-so-distant time when people didn't collectively suffer from ADD, and had the ability to concentrate and think. Dr Bronowski's commentary is fascinating and riveting, and that's what it is about. TAOM is a brilliant educational tool which remains as relevant now as ever. And for those who have a problem with the title, well, to put it in your generation's vernacular - build a bridge and get over it. It's a study of the human race; not an exercise in gender appeasement."
3,Does not really slim me up,"I have the same problem with other waist control items. Since I am small many these item just fit and do not really tighten up. I tried this because you offered the XS and most items carries up to S. This product does smooth me out a bit, but so do the other products I've tried. My belly and thighs were still giggly."
2,Doesn't Work,"I bought this device to support demonstrations a little over a year ago. I had great difficulty connecting to a WIFI network. Once I did, I couldn't get the phone to associate with my SIP proxy. Thought that it was something I was doing wrong, so I waited to write this review.Well, since then I've set up dozens of other SIP devices and after seeing and reading about all of their document quirks, I decided to make another go at it. Still does not work.You are better off buying the latest device instead of making this one work."
4,From a Police Defensive Tactics Instructor,"I have been a Police Officer for over 16 years, and a Martial Artist for over 23 years. I have been in charge of teaching Police Defensive Tactics for the last three years and I teach over 200 officers a year. I really enjoyed this book (I also own other Loren Christensen books), and found it funny, fast paced and informative. This book is more geared toward D-Tac instructors and not the student though. I think that this book should be mandatory reading for all Police Brass and I.A. people.Fast reading, and very well written. Good job Loren."
1,Way to far beyond defensive tactics.,The book is short on defensive tactics and long on cop war stoies. You would advised to spend your money on a better defensive tactics book.
2,Finding the diamond under all this coal shouldn't be this much work.,"I'm currently labouring my way through this book. I'm finding this particular first-person presentation off-putting in the extreme. The dialog is rambling, the minutia is endless, the vernacular is thicker than a spring pile of manure in a winter barn, there's too much ""shrimper"" terminology and no explanation, characters aren't properly introduced. It's all just too confusing, and, for my money, the author's ""voice"" comes across as presumptous, self-important, and irritating. I wanted to give this story one star; I relented and added the second due to the fact that, underneath all the rubble, I suspect lies a worthy story. I may have to give up on this one, something I virtually never do. Maybe someday I'll see the movie...if it's ever made."
4,very valuable information,"The authors gathered a massive amount of data of their own and also used previously published statistics to describe ""life under reform."" For anyone interested in China or in the effects of reform on any socialist society, this book has valuable information. It offers details that a non-Chinese expert can really value. Recommend for people studying transitions in Eastern Europe besides just Asian scholars."
4,Democracy in Perspective,"Democracy is spoken of as the panacea for the world's woes. Fukuyama's END OF HISTORY seemed to operate just on this premise. Crick's book focuses on democracy's historical evolution, its polyvalent adaptations and its transformation into republicanism. Following his essay from Greece to Rome to American and European democracy, we see how democracy is not necessarily another way of saying just and/or good politics. Most interesting are the final chapters on the conditions needed for a democratic polity and the responsibilities of the individual in a system of democratic citizenship. He ends with a nice quote from Reinhold Niebuhr, ""Man's inclination to justice makes democracy possible; but man's capacity for injustice makes it necessary."""
5,What more can be said?,I love this DVD. I like that it is split into chapters so you can go straight to the one needed. This is great for me so I can only review the section I need. I don't want to say she has outrageous dresses because I wasn't so much distracted by them but impressed by them. She obviously made all the dresses and I like that she probably designed them all and did something she loves. You have to respect that even if you don't like the style. She obviously knows what she's talking about in the videos and that's what matters. I also like her style of teaching. I never feel like she's talking down but just including us in her sewing. Fabulous details and pride are exhibited here for the viewers enjoyment.
2,Banana Bread is not Clif Bar's best,"I grab a Clif Bar on my way to work every morning. As such, I tend to choose more fruit based bars and not the chocolate ones. (Black Cherry Almond is still the best flavor) When I first saw the Banana Bread flavor, I thought it would be a perfect day-starter flavor, especially as someone who likes banana bread. Unfortunately, they taste like they were made from rotten bananas. There was something not quite right about the banana flavor. I'd send them back to kitchen to tweak the formula."
3,Eh,"Don't personally like these, but I can eat them. Of course that's why there are tons of bars to chose from.That being said, I don't think they taste like Banana Nut Breat at all."
4,So far so good,"I got this for $31 shipped on Amazon, when it was $79 everywhere else. I wanted an inexpensive beeper since I have never used one, I didn't know how the dog would react. This beeper has alot of features for the money, I have used it on 4 weekends hunting, and it has worked great. The dog hated it at first but got used to it. I will say it is definately worth the $31, I think for $79 I might shop a little harder and maybe upgrade for a few extra bucks."
1,Linux not for dummies should be this title,"I'm expert in Windows/Dos environment, working with them for more than 17 years. Now I'm trying to initiate in Linux, but this is not the book. The authors write like you are an expert and should explain more about some technical words, including making comparision between DOS/Windows and Linux. I've stopped in partinioning chapter (one of the first) and can't go one. I think these authors should try to talk to real dummies and that person who are really beginning in Linux. I've start reading Linux Bible and I saw that the problem was not me... now Linux is being easier to me..."
4,"Awesome Book, good for newbies...","Red Hat Linux for Dummies 7.0 is a great book for those users who wish to learn Linux. Linux is a great operating system, extremely stable when compared to Windows.The book goes from the install process, interent configuration, and even some bash shell scripting. The book covers the topics fully and is rich in detail. As for being a Server Administrator for EchoShell(we run FreeBSD) for a couple months now, I even learned some new commands and features of Linux.I do favor FreeBSD over Linux, but Linux is great for people who want to get into the alternative operating system world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the world of Linux. The book has just enough to get you started and teaches you the basic functionality of the Red Hat Linux Operating System."
4,horses and computers,"Two brothers, one a teacher, the other a horseman, dealing with a computer program for handicapping races. Like all of his books, this one is character driven.Could have more horses in it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Interesting one that I read to start with, revolving around a computer prediction program. Little did I know at the time about what reading about computer programs to predict horse racing would lead to. Definitely a good yarn, this one, certainly would recommend it to others that like this sort of story."
5,The Promise,This was a great book. We used this book in our Summer Vacation Bible School this year. I think the book gives you just enough information to make you think and want to dig further in your Bible. We did not finish the book in VCBS however I plan on completing the book on my own.
1,Too much non-natural detail,"Why so much language about the scrapes and mishaps of Kanze and his long-suffering wife? I want to read about the wildlife, not about them. This book is too egocentric for me."
4,Use Your Discretion,"This anthology is a valuable companion for any teacher who wants to incorporate poetry into their classroom. I love many of the selections, reading each poem either quietly to myself or out loud to my students; however, several poems are inappropriate for middle students.Some poems contain curses and mention alcoholic beverages. Suicide was a topic in one or two, while a small unit seems to be devoted to an anti-American theme. (I believe a one-sided political agenda is unimaginative for young writers; they deserve a spectrum of viewpoints.) While every poem is well written, I feel uncomfortable saying the ""n"" word or imitating a speech impediment, for example, to a group of middle school students. (I can't think of a setting where I would feel comfortable doing this.) Use your discretion with this book.Fortunately there are a few hundred poems. So, if daily poetry is something you'd like to add to your teaching repertoire, and I highly recommend it, this is a good start."
2,Irritating & fascinating...,"In book 2, Jenna has mastered the board of wind/air and is looking for the next one - water. You would have hoped that after all she had been through in the first book, she would have learned to be more cautious. But even after accepting help, Jenna is stubborn as ever when it comes to people telling her what to do. In this one, I just couldn't get past the sheer stupidity that her stubborness caused. The name of a sudden love interest is a dead giveaway from the beginning, and again you find yourself wanting to slap sense into the girl as she falls into trap after trap... as it drags on, the only relief is Simon who is more likeable already. Despite some unbelievable circumstances and suspiciously lax airport security, when you finally get to the end, you find yourself drawn into the next adventure. I think this would definitely make a great T.V series with some adjustments."
4,Norelco 8825XL,So far I have had this product for 2 weeks.Norelco 8825XL gives a much closer shave than my previous norelco product which I had a few yrs ago. Easy to clean as well.Nothing negative to report so far.
4,mr manson does it again,"well.....hes done it again...with 3 great albums by him here he is with a pretty cool picture disc taking you into the realm of himself and his band and im sure with his own blend of humour and wittiness he,ll come out with a 4th album keeping him top of the list on the alternative music scene.......MR MANSON you have done it again"
5,Surgical knee Durkold wrap,Excellent product; great service!! Just had bilateral knee surgery (both knees replaced) Feb 20th. I had a durakold wrap from a previous injury so I knew what to purchase. This wrap has been a god-send!!!!
2,Not helpful,"I think this book is not clear with its definitions and descriptions. It uses too many poor visual examples and there is a point of overexplaining the information to where it becomes convoluted. I had to read this for a class and, fortunately, was able to google a free website that followed the same teaching principles and steps in much shorter and clearer definitions."
2,Not good for self study,I am taking a course which uses this book. The book is written well but there is no answer key in the book for the problems. There is no way to get feedback on the exercises. Even the practice question in the chapters do not have answers.
5,A very interesting movie,"A very interesting movie about the Lincoln Brigade's participation in the Spanish Civil War. The fact that America was so cruel and discriminatory to them after the war and that it didn't support the war efforts despite the fact that 75% of the people did is sad. Even now, those who went to fight for the Republic in Spain are being incorrectly viewed as fighting for communism when they were just fighting for freedom"
5,what vioces,This was my first Il Divo CD. I fell in love with their sound after seeing them on TV. This CD is the sound of angels.
3,Short and sweet,"I will keep this review short and sweet. I recently saw these talented guys open for Barbra Streisand in San Jose, CA. They have booming voices, great prescence, potential, etc....however, their producers need to pick new songs and not have them sing songs that have been done a million times over and done better. Also, they have now released 4 cd's since early 2005! Their management needs to take them into the studio, take their time and put out something stellar! They are MORE THAN CAPABLE OF IT! I don't fault the guys for this lackluster release, I fault their management team!"
5,simply divine,"What wonderful voices and what fun to listen to. I don't even care when it is English or not, the sound is just great. My favorite group and I have purchased nearly everything."
5,Fantasic Next Step,"This album is so fantastic, I find myself plugging in my headphones and I go to sleep and wake up to Il Divo's Siempre album. It is an absolutely wonderful sound to go to sleep to and wake up to. I play it all day while doing the everyday chores. But with Il Divo, the time flies by and I am able to just sit, close my eyes and see the guys singing. Ah what a wonderful life."
4,Awesome vocalists!,"Il Divo is now my favorite group after recently hearing them on Oprah! Their voices are incredible and can relax you after a hectic day. Beautiful music, but I can only give a 4 star rating since there is only one song in English on this CD. Still nice listening, but I can't sing along much."
3,Interesting,"While I don't necessarily agree w/ Lewis' ideas of heaven and hell, it was written in an innovative way and was certainly thought-provoking."
5,Excellent CSS Lewis story,Amazing book by a great storyteller. Gives you a lot to think about! If you liked Screwtape letters you will love this as well.
3,Not as good as I had expected...,"Erdrich's Tracks offers a new and intriguing perspective on Native American life. Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."
1,"Painful, painful, painful","I appreciate an author's attempt at using creative narratives and vivid imagery, but only in small doses and when it serves to enhance the story. The problem with Tracks is that the narrative and imagery don't enhance the story. Instead, they confuse it and drag it down, slowing down the pace and making me wonder if it isn't just an attempt to flesh out what should really be a short story. Sometimes, more is just more, not better. I kept wishing Erdrich would stop playing with words and just tell the stupid story and get it over with. Just another great example of how Fiction has lost sight of storytelling in favor of novels that are so bogged down under the weight of their prose that they fail to engage readers."
1,Boring,I very seldom not finish reading a book but I could not take more than half of this book. It rambled on - jumped all around - very confusing. Maybe it was me or the mood I was in - my apologies to those of you who liked it.
2,Not for anyone who likes action.,"I read this for a college Novels course, and found it very average. The novel was a little confusing, being that it switched from narrator-to-narrator, and as well, there seemed to be very little driving the story. I was dissapointed by the lack of rhyme or reason behind the story, and found it, in general, bland."
2,Not so good ending.,"After reading through what I thought was going to be a good book, the ending was very disappointing, like when the author got near the ending she just gave up or ran out of detail and ideas. Very poor ending to what could've been a really good book."
4,Got soft copy by mistake,"Got two copies in brand new condition.The old copy I had given away was a hard copy with red velvet inside cover pages.I guess I was expecting the books to be like that,I hadn't noticed that these copies was listed as soft copies,and I am not sure they were specified as paperbacks ...This is an issue with online shopping, one has to be really careful onesexpectations are met...I still really prefer an ""analog"" bookshop any day, and for every book I buy on amazon I try to support a""real"" book store with the same amount!But: great service from seller and no complaints"
3,Not much Masai,"The only thing Masai or Kenyan about this book was the Masai mask. The book is about an African boy - possibly African American - who can't figure out what to do for the school talent show. His family wants him to play the kalimba, which by the way is not a Kenyan instrument. Joshua feels that his African instrument isn't cool enough.The story is a good story and illustrations are great. When I obtained this book I was hoping for a story about Masai people - or a little something about Kenya. You know, a children's story book. Anyway, I was initially quite disappointed with this book."
5,happy,"A very well put together document, I would advise any serious student to have in library.The author has spent many hours to make this work a special addition to any bible filled shelve."
2,not as good as it seems,I bought this title after looking and looking at many reviews for Italian cookbooks. I have made 5-6 recipes and cannot rave about even one.
4,Oportunidad de volver a leer clásicos de la literatura francesa,"Siempre pensé que parte de la “Vuelta del Mundo en 80 Días” se hacía en globo. (O quizás, me estoy confundiendo con la novela “cinco semanas…”. El problema con estas ediciones gratuitas es que nunca se sabe si están completas o no. Pero hay que reconocer; sin ellas y el Kindle nunca habría vuelto a leer estos clásicos de la literatura francesa. Un excelente libro, por si…"
5,sehr gutes Buch,Dieses Buch hat mir sehr gefallen denn ich sah for kurzem den Film . Denn noch ist das buch voller abenteuer und besser beschrieben.Ich würde dieses Buch weiter empfehlen ganz besonders für junge Jugendliche .
4,Classics,We should read all classics books before starting reading other books. As I am learning French I started reading this that I have already read when I was a youth.I liked it very much.
3,A must for Red Skelton fans,"If you've ever wondered what Red Skelton did before television, this is your answer! Not only does Red utter his famous ""I dood it"", but he also does impressions of George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and Chester Morris. This film also stars Bert Lahr, the cowardly lion from ""The Wizard of Oz"", in a supporting role. The real surprise is an unbilled appearance by Frank Sinatra! Eleanor Powell has some nice musical numbers, but the real star is Red Skelton!"
5,Awesome comic!,This is the best Ultimate Spider-Man story yet! Venom is reinvented Ultimate style and he's never been better. Lots of action and heart in this one. Check it out.
3,Somewhat Below East Side Standards.,"This East Side Kids melodrama introduces Huntz Hall, one of the original Dead End boys, to this series, and quaintly casts Keye Luke, Charlie Chan's ""Number One Son"" as a pool hall manager (named Clancy!), but each performer plays only a small role in this story of Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) and his gang. Released before the U.S. entry into WWII (ergo the Teutonic title), the film is devoid of the customary wartime propaganda that the series featured, but it is also shorn of the snappy ad libbing that caught the Gotham flavour of most of these affairs, and we must settle for a rapidly moving but largely uninvolving account of Muggs' decision to go straight amidst the usual background of the fight game and gangsters."
4,"A ""must read"" for horse owners!","I bought this book in an attempt to gain some insight into my yearling colt's behavior. It worked! My communication with my colt has begun and I'm now looking forward to the lessons this beautiful little guy has to teach me. The book is very well written by a man who obviously cares deeply about all horses. His insight into horses' behavior and his communicative skills with them leave me in awe. My only regret is that the author did not go into a little more detail in certain areas. I have much to learn, but the book certainly gave me lots to think about. Good job, Mr. Rashid!"
5,real eyecatcher!!,Excellent book!! The best of Richard's so far!!Having to find the little golden bug on each page kept them going for hours! And somehow they never got tired of this book. After it was wripped to pieces from wear and tear I bought them another one.
5,Deja Vu all over,"When my son was born in 1977, his favorite book for my wife and I to read to him was Ricahrd Scarry's Cars and Trucks and Things that go. I have been trying to get it in book stores and I said well I'll try Amazon and lo and behold Amazon had it and a great low price. Now my son can read this wonderful book to his son who turned 1 in June. So Grandpa is proud to give it to his son so the fun to find ""Goldbug"" will continue for another generation. Thanks, Jeffrey Doty."
5,Exactly what i was expecting....very nice,"A Richard Scarry Classic, this is the perfect book for your little car-loving boy or girl. Love it! The illustrations are wonderful and so much fun for my toddler."
5,This was my favorite book when I was 8.,"A friend of mine had this book when I was eight years old, and I would read it every time I went over to his house. It was the coolest book, and I haven't seen it in 13 years. I'd like to buy it for myself now, just so I'll have my own copy."
1,Quality issue,"I recently ordered this book. The first copy I received had a quality issue. The print colors in many of the illustrations were incorrect. For instance, the pigs were green. For another, there were paint cans to help teach children colors and the paint can that was labeled blue was actually printed in red, etc... I returned the book and ordered a new one. The new book had the exact same print color error. I believe Amazon has a complete lot of incorrect books. I have notified them by phone and e-mail. I am waiting to hear back."
5,A wonderful book!,"We have worn through at least four copies of this book. It was my oldest son's favorite book for at least two years, and is now my youngest son's favorite book. We have read this book more times than I can count! Lots of fun stuff to look at, funny stories."
5,Great book for young kid,This book has all kinds of cars for kids who loves cars to read and learn. My son just loves it.
5,Great-grandmothers tradition passed down...,My great grandmother gave this book to me and each of my cousins when we were very young. I have recently started the same tradition with my nieces and will continue with my own children.The book is a great one - so much fun to find the yellow bug! Kids of all ages really enjoy it!
5,Great book,This is a great book. I have many Richard Scarry books that my son grew up with and loved. Now my grandson is growing up with the same books and he loves them also. These are perfect books for young children!
5,Quality Cleaning Kit,"This cleaning rod is made of thick, high quality brass. It feels sturdy in the hand. The plastic end also feels thick and sturdy. Seems like a quality product that will last a while."
4,Great item,the xm radio is great. I was never one to listen to the radio very much because the DJ's around here suck. not a problem with xm. plus unlike tv there is always something good on. very easy to set up and use. Just make sure you have a southern exposer. I tried using it in my company's break room which faces north east and couldn/t get a signal. Otherwise a great item. I only wish the programming included the Jeff Foxworthy countdown.
5,xm2go,"Most excellent more than I expeced. Great sound, easy to use, easy to transfer from house to car. Love the memory feature.Good choice of payment and service options.Would be even better if it had an SD Card and could plau mp3."
3,urban not rural device,"works well in urban areas with a lot of repeaters, Unfortunately poor reception in rural areas (where you really need it!) where only satellite reception and no repeaters."
2,Not that great,"I am over all very disappointed with this unit. Car reception is very spotty even traveling down major corridors in the SF Bay Area. Walking around is worse no matter what you do with the antenna. The talk shows are so heavily compressed they sound like they are using a cup and string to talk to you. The music stations do not sound as good as FM radio, which I was terribly disappointed to discover. Friends who have the more standard home/car XM units think they are great. This one suffers from very poor engineering. It goes up on eBay tomorrow."
1,defetive XM,Ordered unit and it arrived pretty quick. This was a replacement unit for one of my two that had lost it's screen but still works. This replacement unit was DOA. I tried different batteries that were working in my existing units and still nothing. The unit has a defect. Seems they should have checked before sending. Vendor sent me a shipping label and it has been quite awhile since I took it to the UPS pick up. Still waiting on my refund. This is the best XM receiver there is-when it works.
4,It's what I expected,"If you are a commuter into a metro city, this is the unit for you.1. You get transient signal everywhere in the city.2. Use the clip on antenna (with the suction cup) when on the train [at least for me].I gave it 4 stars because I only got signal about 80% of the time during the train ride."
3,"Nice, but could be better",I have been an XM subscriber almost since day one. My Old Sony Plug N Play was pretty large and cumbersome. This new MyFi unit is great! The TV ads with Elton John walking around are a bit misleading. After using this on a trip to Florida I can see why he appeared to be roaming around the house. He was probably looking for a signal. Without the magnetic car mount antenna or the home mount antenna the unit's reception is a bit iffy. With either of those antennas attached the unit was flawless. The recording feature works great to timeshift your favorite shows.I have mine mounted in the car using the tape adapter and car antenna. This provided the best fidelity over the FM modulated.I got over 6 hours on one charge with the backlit screen off. It runs about 4 hours with the back light on.The mounting kits is very versatile with many variations available.The hat antenna is quite funny looking and it's additional performance not worth the looks from others around you.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!,"I have been surprised and dismayed by the XM MyFi. One fairly critical piece of information left out of all materials is the fact that the antenna HAS TO FACE SOUTH IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY SIGNAL WHATSOEVER. Thankfully, the happy folks at XM Technical Support offered this encouragement when I noted that my office and home face north -- ""You can still use it outside."" Thanks. That might still be moderately helpful if the portable XM really worked well. Instead, you have to work into just the right position, like a sad, contorted scarecrow, in order to get a passable signal. Here I am, wired like a demented robot with an earphone cord as well as (another thing they hesitate to mention) antenna cord pinned to me, and if I move (Lord forbid that you move with the music), the signal cracks and disappears.This product was introduced long before XM had the technology to support it. Odd that AM radio (and possibly even ham radio) are starting to look better all the time. Hmmm."
5,TRUE ALL-IN-ONE XM RADIO EXPERIENCE!,"Bought this because someone stole my Roady2 from my car. When I bought the Roady2, I had to buy a separate kit to play at home. It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but it makes me appreciate this Delphi unit even more. Literally everything is included for car and home use, as well as attaching it to your belt. I point the antenna south, and get max reception in both the mountains and central part of NC. My favorite feature is clicking through the stations by category, instead of having to go through each station. Much easier! And being able to record favorites for later use-WOW!I bought it with the Altec player for $35- getting both has given me more value for the money than any purchase I've made in years!"
3,Some bugs you should know about,"I bought my Delphi XM2go in 2006. I am still using it and still loving it!! But here is what you should know:After six months of use, it started to freeze up and stop working. It turns out that you have to change the battery a few times a year. Also, it turns out that the ""home set"" dock is a sensitive little thing. The little pins where you plug in your device, so it can recharge etc..well, the little pins go bad. Seriously bad.I ordered, like, 4 different home sets just to get new docks. They work fine for awhile...and then they don't. Really, my actual XM2go radio unit always works absolutely fine and has not needed servicing or replacement. My problems were with the battery and the dock, that's all. Finally I decided to just leave it in the dock and use it like a non-mobile, non-""2-go"" device, and it seems much happier.LOL, when I talked to their service dept, they said I shouldn't have bought this unit at all, that I should buy the Inno instead!"
2,Not the best choice anymore,"I had one of these, and loved it at first, because I didn't know any better and I was thrilled to get XM radio. Then a burglar helpfully removed it from my home, and I replaced it with a Roady2, a less expensive, less attractive device that still got XM.Reasons I still feel I traded ""up"":-- The reception in the Delphi MyFi XM2GO is inferior. Unless the conditions were exactly right, I had trouble getting the signal.-- The keypad is obnoxious and strange. Yes, it looks cool. I do not buy radios to look at, I buy them to listen to. This keypad is difficult to use unless you look right at the thing when you use it.-- It's heavier than other models, annoying in a portable device.So ""thank you"" to the burglar (whoever bought it at a great price from the fence got what he/she deserved) and I suggest at the very least that you try this radio before you buy it!"
1,DONT BUY DELPHI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DONT BUY DELPHI !!!! My son and I have had 2 niether lasted for a fullyear. He has a roady and went to get a new one - Not at any stores. So if you bought the home unit and mobile your screwed unles you buy old unit on the internet. What a crock !!!!!!!! they changed all the connections so you have to by ALL new stuff - the unit, the mobile and the home unit. What a screw job buy Delphi. I WONT EVER BY A PRODUCT FROM THEM AGAIN. XM is great just, dont buy Delphi !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,classic wholigans,hey this movie is one of the best who movies out there. The performance is amazing. pete and roger are on top of their game as is ringos son as drummer!they do all the classic who songs and pete still drops the f bombs a couple of times. but i still totally say you should buy it.
1,am i the only one?,who thinks the who should of finished there career when keith moon died because they went on and made two dreadful albums with the ex-small faces drummer kenny rogers who was a great drummer in the small faces just not in the style of the who then comes this dvd which a friend of mine let me borrowed and he said it was the who back on top form.. well i don't hear it all i hear is too old men plodding through their greatest hits and have a backing band..of 6 form intelligance god zak starkey's drumming is awful do be scared to hit the drums zak there not going to bite you and the bass player who-ever he is SUCKS nowhere near the superior of the late great greatest bass player the world has heard MR john Entwistlelike i said in my review on amazon.co.uk the who should of stopped years ago before they turned into a pub tribute band of there glory days please roger and pete stop i can't bear to see you two humilate yourselfs any longer...don't bring out a new album please
5,Outstanding sound and image,"This DVD has excellent sound mixing and the video quality is great too. The camera doesn't jump around as quickly as on the Royal Albert Hall DVD - which is a nice difference. (And no special guests) !!!. Excellent addition for anyone's collection. Pete Townshend's guitar work is the best of his career. Roger Daltrey's voice has changed since he was 25 years old, but actually sounds better than ever.The Who still ROCK !!!"
3,Solid Atmospheric Hammer horror,"Only trouble with this Warner Home Video version for the U.S. is it was trimmed of 4 mins. before release in 1970 to make a PG rating and they have never restored it. Not 4 mins. of excess, but 4 mins. of intensity, so as a result this version does not pack the punch of the uncut version. A shame, as otherwise an excellent film."
3,The fourth in the fabulas series,"As just about every movie-goer will know, a series of movies always loses it after a while. After watching the fairly dull DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE (the third installment in Hammer's Drcula series), I was expecting this one to be a turkey but it actually was good nostalgic entertainment. Even though it takes Christopher Lee about 30 minutes to arrive into the film, Ralph Bates (HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN, DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE) keeps the film moving. He plays a satanist who drinks Dracula's blood and turns into him. It's all rather obvious, but good fun."
2,Bleh.,"This movie was both boring and way too complicated in a way that didn't make sense. The acting was tepid at best, probably because the screenplay was a huge yawn. The production looked cheap, and the female protagonist was usually dressed like she was going to some yuppiefied cocktail party, whether or not she actually was doing so. I suppose it's better than staring at the wall, or picking at your nails, but I can think of a lot of better ways to spend your time than watching this movie."
5,Easy to understand,"I remember referring this book for my Undergraduate class in probability and it explained difficult concepts in the most simplest way by using good visuals (diagrams, graphs etc). Therefore, it's a very good book for anyone starting out new since probability concepts can be hard to grasp initially. Highly recommend for students interested in stochastic processes and probability."
5,Great book for introduction to probability,This is a great book; it is very thorough and has lots of examples. The greatest feature of this book is that the solutions to the end of chapter problems are provided on the publisher's web site. This makes self study possible.
5,Nasty Astrology Book,So far so good. I love books & enjoy the variations from book to book. Like art everyone has there own interpretation!
4,speedy service,"I ordered this product for a Christmas gift that I had to mail out of state, so was very happy that 2 days after I ordered it , it was delivered to me and I could get it mailed onto where it need to go. Thanks for the great service on a very nice item."
3,"Photography, Art, OR Trees","As a Photographer this book is Fine, as a Sculptor it is OK, as a Botanist it is Minimal, as a Lumberjack it is a Bore. I would suggest you not buy this book if you are looking for Good photographs of Champion Tree Specimens. But if you are looking for Beautifull photographs of Trees this is a great book. The photographic style takes it away from a book of specimens and to a book of photographic art."
4,an attention holder,Downtown is a real attenton holder. The author gives the reader an interesting narrative about the growth and change of the various characters. I didn't want it to end. I do recommend it for the under 50 age group.
4,Inspiring performances,"A few spots moved a little slowly, but the acting was very engaging. We knew there would be a transformation in the characters, but it happened with depth and not superficially."
3,Relationship Need Fixing?,"Take your spouse into a cholera epidemic. That seems to be part of the message of The Painted Veil, where egocentrics turn noble in the face of a scourge and British ingenuity gets fresh water back into town. If that all sounds a little Empire-ish and 20's-ish, so be it. Maugham wrote the novel, after all, in 1925. And if the characters are mostly walking cardboard, some very good actors give them a dash of life, including Naomi Watts as Kitty, Diana Rigg as Mother Superior, and -- especially -- Toby Jones as Waddington. The on location settings are beautiful, and the film works nicely as a travelogue for journeys to the Chinese interior, assuming that epidemic has stayed quelled. I watched The Painted Veil, enjoyed it, and found not one thing in it that will last in memory beyond tomorrow morning. It did, in short, what some movies set out to do -- entertain. And sometimes that's enough."
2,Remarkably boring,"The message was good but don't waste your time. Long, drawn out, very dull, gloomy,wish I hadn't seen it."
2,What a snore!,"This movie was terribly boring. While I enjoy watching the occasional period piece, the story line was boring and so were the characters. The onscreen pairing of Edward Norton and Naomi Watts was off and lacking in even undercurrents of chemistry. I think for the character of Kitty Fane, they should have chosen a more lively and vivacious actress. Either way, if you are looking for a boring, stuffy movie, this is it!"
4,beautiful,"The year is 1925. Kitty (Naomi Watts) is a naive woman, whose mother expects her to marry soon. She meets a young dull and shy man, Doctor Walter Fane (Edward Norton), a bacteriologist. They marry, and soon find themselves in China. Walter discovers Kitty's affair with a diplomat, Charles Townsend (Liev Shreiber); Walter then will force Kitty to come with her to a remote village ravaged by cholera.He is very much in love with her, but it is not reciprocal. After the affair is discovered, their relationship soon becomes cold, and indifferent.This is a movie about love lost and love earned - the director showed this well, the script was decent enough and believable, still a little too predictable for my taste. (Anyone will see the ending coming miles away!)The cast is quite excellent, and the characters they play are rather likable and invite the viewer to join them on a fascinating journey in 1920s China.It is a beautiful, well-adapted, well-directed film to watch."
4,A worthwhile purchase,"Despite the infidelity of wife Kitty, her husband Walter truly does 'save' their marriage. He is constant in his love for her though there is a veil of resentment. He is a good man, through and through. It is a story of courage, constancy, forgiveness and hope. I loved it. What a great movie!"
5,Very good,"Loved the book, i actually saw the movie first then decided to read the book. The movie was good but the book was even better. I recommend it."
2,could of been,The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel. Each separately would of received more stars. It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored. This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars). Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'. He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel. In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowed
3,"Slow start, but it grows on you","I bought this book because I had heard that Chatwin's writing was lyrical. The first part of the book left me cold; oddly passionless, it was a fairly dull description of traveling under somewhat unpleasant conditions. The excerpts from his notebooks, however, were engaging and thought-provoking. I found myself much more involved in the latter portion of the book.It occurs to me that Chatwin had written his notebook entries long before his trip to Australia. Possibly the lackluster quality of the first half was due to his illness; the ""flashback"" portion of the book was much more dynamic and showed great vitality. Because of the notes, I'll work backward and try some of Chatwin's earlier works. I doubt, however, that I'll re-read the Australian portion of Songlines."
1,What a Shameful Sham,"How can you take seriously a book that cites Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as revisionist history? The first two chapters are a sparse, 12-page description of what the author claims is critical thinking. This is followed by a tour through history, science and religion. What becomes more and more obvious as you read is the entire enterprise is a thinly disguised arguement for Creationism, the Anthropic Principle, Intelligent Design, and Christian Theology. The author concludes with the claim that Christian theism does not violate the rules of Science.I was so hoping to find a book that actually dealt with Critical Thinking. I am still hoping."
4,Red Bird Down,"I highly recommend this book. I liked it because it is honest,and does'nt try to be pretentious of what happened there. This book is long overdue to tell the truth about an unpopular war,the young men who fought it. Their ideals about it and the reality of the misgivings that came with it. For anyone who was there it will make you remember things you forgot. For those who were'nt there it will shed new light on what Vietnam was all about to the men doing their duty. Everyone can learn from this book."
5,Well made!,A great little HO scale model car which looks great on my model train layout. It is well made and the colors are muted and realistic. No need for weathering here. The usual top of the line from Woodland Scenics.
3,Not for serious hiking,"Bought two (one for each of my two sons). We went on two hikes totalling 11 miles. One pole was used for two miles with no problems. The other pole was used for all 11. The basket fell off this second pole within the first half-mile of use. After screwing it back on multiple times, my son finally left it off. Good starter poles, but not for serious hiking."
4,A lot of features for a small price,"I found the product description accurate, and the other reviews spot-on. At the risk of repeating what they've said, this is a great hiking pole for a low price. The anti-shock mechanism is easy to turn off and on, the locking mechanism provides a positive stop, and the pole is sturdy without being ""stiff.""I am planning to hike, and to take landscape photos, so a hiking pole with a camera stud seemed like a good idea. It adjusts high enough to be useful as a monopod.The cons? The handle and strap are not ""ergonomic."" The pole's collapsed length of 29"" is not exactly ""packable."" Nobody's going to mistake you for Indiana Jones."
4,So Far So Good,So far so good. I find the round top much more comfortable than a regular cane.If you get lost in the supermarket you can use the attached compass to find your way. If you think it's too hot or cold you can chech the attached thermometer.
2,Huh?,"I was disappointed in this one...I found Cherishment to be a disconcerting and frustrating mix of technical jargon and rambling stream of consciousness. I'm big into self-discovery and learning about how psychothereapy works these days, and certainly understanding the role that cherishment (or lack thereof) plays in the individual and in society at large sounds valuable and interesting, but the authors make you work too hard for too little. The only interesting parts were the segments on the author's patients where they got into some real concrete discussions and examples about the effect of lack of cherishment on these individuals."
4,Season full of screaming and drama,"I decided to buy this season since I love The Amazing Race and wanted to watch a season I had never seen.The product is made on-demand which explains why when it came the cover was inserted the wrong way and there were no bonus features.But all in all,it ran fine in my DVD player.Having never seen this season,I did not know what to expect.There were a lot of couples,dating or married,which adds up to a lot of fighting and good drama for the show.Be forewarned that you will hate Jonathan.The guy is verbally and at times physically abusive to his wife.It's hard to watch that.Also,another contestant that I did not like was Kendra.Look up the word snob in a dictionary and her name is under it.Your jaw will drop when you hear some of the things she says about the places they are visiting.It's an embarrassment.Other wise I enjoyed this season.I couldn't stop watching and I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Myth buster,"I had read several of Bryson's magazine articles and enjoyed them. This book, while full of fascinating information and facts, was a little too much of a good thing under one cover. Fortunately, the chapters were easily devoured in one sitting and the book could be returned to after several days without losing track. An enjoyable, easy read."
3,"Better stick to travel,Bill!","Having enjoyed his travelogues,I was deeply disappointed in this attempt at scholarly analysis.(Perhaps best to leave it to the qualified professionals) Sloppy and ill-researched.His attempt to play down U.S.educational standards,the worst in the major western world ,was none too clever.The fact that more American students go to college is due to an easier educational system(3 years behind the UK and Europe)."
4,For the Etymological Nerd,"Made in America is recomended especially for the etymological nerd at heart. Bryson takes a look at word development specifically in America and how various countries/cultures influenced American English and word origins.Portions of history are interspersed as well which provide a nice respite from a purely etymological perspective on words. Bryson's humorous writing style makes learning the history of words somewhat fun. At times, one needs to wade through monotonous parts and using a skimming reading technique is advised."
4,Bryson as usual,"As usual, Bill Bryson is informative, witty, and brilliant in his relaying of this history of the United States. I had to dock him a star in the ratings this time out because this is billed, based on the title, as a history of the English language in America. It is more appropriately described as a brief history of America and its culture, with some occasional attention to the language. Since I bought it due to a recent interest in word origins, I was mildly (and only mildly) disappointed at the lesser degree of attention paid to etymology. However, since I've read most of Bryson's other books and can't get enough of his writing style and his no-nonsense approach to fact-finding, and since many of the stories he relates really are quite fascinating, the book is still a very welcome addition to my library."
1,seemed like cheap knock-off,"This seemed like a very cheap knock off of a better product. The whole thing falls apart if you undo one screw to far, I might add it's the main adjustment screw for it. That in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't come apart while you are using it. Can you say 'Pain?'The materials seem flimsy and the quality low. Sorry I bought this, now I have to search for a higher quality one.Can you give ZERO stars?"
5,Melamine Edging,I used the Melamine Edging to finish off the top of a door that was cut in half to make a Dutch Door.The iron on process was easy and it made it look like a finished .
3,Boring,Not too accurate with the story. It's nice and dramatic. forgettable movie. Prepare to be bored for long stretches.
1,"a ""box-office failure"" indeed","What can one say about this pretty but slushy, mushy film. Hmmm..it's boring, Jodie Foster was miscast, people reacted to this film when it was released in the theatres just like Superman reacts to Kryptonite.I watched this film with an open mind; I realised that it was not the usaual action-packed Chow Yun Fat flick but this was beyond painful.."
3,Good movie!,I've always loved the story of Anna Lewonowens and her journey to Thailand. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun Fat play their roles superbly!
2,Very disappointing,"Jody Foster was just so terribly miscast in this. Apparently she thought acting this role was pursing up her mouth all the time. Instead of sticking to the story they threw in battles which, of course, Ms Foster helps to win. The whole thing was ridiculous. She never unbends from her starchiness at all and it gets very tiring and boring. I guess they thought a handsome king and gorgeous dresses would satisfy everybody. I read the book many years ago, have seen the original 40s movie many times and, of course, The King and I many times. This version is pathetic."
5,Taken,"Taken was never a movie,as a woman, I thought I would enjoy,but I was wrong. My first impression was oh no another car chasing needless violence movie,again wrong. To me it was the first interesting movie that contained those elements,but balanced out with real excellent acting from the everyone involved.For entertainment I would recommend this movie(even for women) for people who want to see a dvd with the total entertainment package. I learned don't judge a dvd by its cover!!!Enjoy"
3,Overtaken by the Impossible,"A violent movie that relies on the viewer setting aside all expectations that the progression of the story line is possible. Liam Neeson is always good and had the writers kept the premise but carried it through in a less fantastic manner, it would be a totally solid movie."
1,He's no Steven Segal!,"My adult kids know how much I love watching my boys Segal, Van Damme & Norris. My youngest (27) suggested I watch Taken as Leeson is the new Segal. Wrong! At least my fellas make now bones about the action thriller movies they make. Taken was cheezy and unimpressive."
2,Please....I can only roll my eyes,"Good thing I was able to borrow this DVD. First, the acting was pretty good (hence the two stars)- what very little of it that there was in this movie.A bunch of unrealistic, stupid, macho, testosterone driven drivel.I am tired of these movies where in this instance, one super-tough guy can single-handedly take on three levels of entire crime syndicate, in addition to avoiding the entire French intelligence force and kill about 50 tough macho thugs with an entire arsenal at their disposal while he only occasionally picks up a gun.An unrealistic fantasy. Blech!"
1,"Avoid, Avoid","Dialogue is impossibly bad and the story feels like it was built according to a checklist of what a bunch of marketing jerks think a ""blockbuster"" contains. Watch at your own risk."
4,Fast moving and quick paced. Thoroughly entertaining.,"Great and efficient flick.My only thing would be that he would be assassinated at the end for all the trouble he caused in Paris. Sort of how it went down for Marv in the Hard Goodbye. It would have been a bit more intense and added some weight and consequences for his actions, especially if he knew all along that he was sacrificing his life for his daughters."
4,taken,I bought this dvd years ago and I still watch it at least every couple of months. I would rate this highly because of the action and fast pace.
4,An Awesome Action-Packed Film!!!,"I thought this was a really good action film! Everybody did an awesome job. This movie is like Max Payne, 24, and Commando all mixed together in one movie! When his daughter is kidnapped and fixing to be sold on the Black Market, Bryan Mills comes out of retirement to save his girl and kill the bad guys! Filled to the brim with action and suspense, I highly recommend TAKEN!!!"
2,the kind of movie that gets you thinking,"Unfortunately, your thinking is all about how farcically preposterous the whole thing is.To be honest, there is nothing that Liam Neeson's character does during any 4-second interval of the film that is not believable. Taking all his actions together, though; that's where the absurdity comes in.One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more. But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.I wonder what the French thought of this film: it was almost an insult to their culture."
3,Solid action movie; nothing more.,"1. I was mildly disappointed by the time this movie finished, not because it was bad, but my expectations were higher than the reality.2. Overall, a good / solid action movie, good acting, good story etc... however nothing beyond that which would move it into the exceptional category. ie, definitely rent the DVD, but it doesn't merit purchasing it for one's collection."
5,"""Taken""","I loved this movie! Great vehicle to show Liam's talents. Good story, good casting for this suspense filled film. I missed this film in the theaters but it was still great to watch on TV."
2,"Excellent movie, Poor Delivery","The movie was great but the streaming through Amazon was so poor we could not enjoy it. Just when the action was getting to its peak, the streaming came to a halt and had to wait up to 5 minutes to continue"
5,Even my wife loved this movie,"Awesome movie. Did not expect it to be that good, but was blown away. I like this movie better than the Bourne movies. I hope there will be a sequel."
4,Awesome movie....,Awesome movie. Came with a digital copy easily downloaded into iTunes. Received blue-ray movie a day early.
4,FUN RIDE!,"A really good movie with a heart-tugging theme - a kidnapped child. Too bad for the kidnappers the father is ex-special services with ""special skills"". This ""romp of revenge"" loses credibility when the bad-guys are felled by single karate chops and the father miraculously escapes machine gun fire, but the theme of relentless pursuit to retrieve your stolen child certainly resonates with this father of a teen. Looking forward to seeing Taken 2. Neeson is perfect for this role!"
3,Standard Hollywood Action Hero...,"This is a typical Hollywood action formula, but it is really pushing it:An aged good guy armed with hand guns vs a truck load of bad guys in their prime with machine guns. As always, bad guys' machine guns can't hit a thing, even at close range. And of course, the good guy never missed.I watched it based on the rave reviews here, but I just couldn't get into it. A barely armed guy in his 60s wipes out a truck load of young guys with machine guns. That's just too much, even for Hollywood. Unless, Liam was secretly using the Force."
1,Business not as usual,The item did not arrive early like gohastings is known for. My family members and myself always buy from the seller because he is known for getting the product out quick but not this time. The movie has a cut through the back od the case and the dvd was damaged because of the cut.
4,Neeson vs. 007 vs. the transporter vs. Jason Bourne!,"Wow, Liam Neeson kicks some serious butt in this movie...As a thriller, this has all the elements you want. Granted, the hollywoodlike setup to the events leading to the plot are extremely typical and standard...but it delivers the goods anyway. Liam Neeson would give 007 and Jason Bourne a run for their money! The scens of him kicking butt are great, and you no doubt will root and cheer as he mows through the bad guys to get to his daughter. Very entertaining from top to bottom."
4,Excellent flick,"Great drama, fantastic story... only hangup is the believability of Liam N's performance in some of the physical aspects. Still a movie i'll be watching again."
4,"Don't shot at him, you'll only make him mad!","4 of 5 stars for the action movie Taken and shout-out for Liam Neeson in the lead role. Neeson plays a retired spy, Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter. The daughter and her girlfriend leave on a trip across Europe against the better judgement of her dad (Neeson). They barely land in Paris when they are kidnapped by slave traders. With few clues, Daddy goes to Paris to recover his daughter. Simple plot idea, extremely well executed (hence my shout-out to Neeson). This is a violent and tough movie; Neeson's body count is around 50 and most with graphic and quick kills. Don't shoot at him, you'll only make him mad! Impressive how he follows from clue to clue. If you don't mind the violence and the graphic underworld plot, it is a great movie. I do recommend it and will watch it again in the future."
2,Just ok movie. Not worth the purchase to me.,"I purchased this movie because it was strongy recommended by a trusted friend and I was buying another movie anyway, so i thought for the price I would just purchase this one rather than rent it since my frined had told me it was a great movie. It was just ok, I probably won't watch it again and I'll end up giving away the DVD. Liam Neeson is good in this movie and it's a good action movie, which I normally like, but the plot was just way too far fetched for me. I also found the character of the daughter and ex-wife very annoying, as the daughter was just a whiny spolied rich girl that gets whatever she wants and the ex-wife seemed very mean unnecessarliy to the exhusband, which made it hard for me to find any sympathy for those characters.Probably won't rent or purchase Taken 2, even though I know others I love these two movies."
1,Ridiculous,"This movie was awful. As much as I love Liam Neeson, I hated this movie. The whole premise is ridiculous. First, it's unbelievable that as a father he would remain as composed as he did and just happen to call as his daughter is ""taken."" There's no way an intelligent viewer could suspend his imagination long enough to believe he could do the things he did to reclaim his daughter. Set aside the fact that he becomes a totally unsympathetic psychopath during the process. The body count is higher than a Terminator movie yet we're supposed to remain behind his cold blooded killing because he's a father who loves his daughter. I watched this with my daughter and ended up having to discuss with her the implications of gratuitous violence and ethics - using the movie as poor examples for both."
1,This one will not play on PS3 with latest (2.76) firmware installed,I bought this movie today and went home to play it in my PS3 player. I put it in my player and got the message I need to update my firmware. I exited out and did a firmware check from the PS3's menu and was told I had the latest version. I then went on Sony's site and found the latest version to be version 2.76. I checked the firmware on the PS3 and it was also 2.76.I searched the net and found another person with the same issue who was able to get the disc working by selecting the disc's icon from the video menu. I was not so lucky.Thanks Fox and the Blu-Ray group. Once again your DRM causes hassles for people who actually purchase your movies. I would stay away from this one if you have a PS3 or if your Blu-Ray manufacturer doesn't update very often. I found other people having the same problem with older players.
1,5 Stars Reviews . . . for this?,"The majority of 5 star reviews really made me want to see this movie. Unbelievable! 5 Star Reviews . . . REALLY? That MUST be a reflection of the immaturity of the viewers or the sheer ignorance of the viewers, it's hard to tell.While the theme and concept are good, the reality of REALITY is just ignored and create success in each pivotal scene just absurd. They're just not even remotely plausible. Liam's character seems to be a combination of a Navy Seal, James Bond, Batman, and maybe a tinge of the six million dollar man who never misses a shot, escapes all harm . . . effortlessly and just ridiculously cannot be stopped by machine guns or anything else. This makes me want to see a science fiction movie just so I can get a plausible story line.Interesting!"
1,Time has been TAKEN from me.,"I always try to give a film a pass for bad lines in the first few mins. but when Liam's buddies say ""remember that time in..."" I thought Uh-oh that's strike whatever and how much longer will I have to watch this to see if there is at least one good character or something in the movie. Nada. Zip. LAME."
5,Taken 1,This movie is outstanding!!! No other like it! I have now watched it 7 times and its still as good as the very first time I saw it!
2,Taken takes violence up a notch - BAM!,"This is a strange move from the normally intellectual roles Neeson plays. He's the former super-spy-now-retired-and-reclusive divorced father who loves his daughter a whole lot. But then (duh-da!) she gets TAKEN.This flick moves very very fast. Once you get past the first twenty minutes, the director kicks it into the stratosphere, and my word do the bodies pile high. Neeson intimidates, maims and kills every bad guy in his way. Taken has no use for its PG-13 rating: only the absence of blood and graphic violence keep this flick just barely from getting the R.Take it for what it's worth, a simple fast and brutal film that's just as forgettable."
3,"Not great, but a fun ride to watch when you're tired.","Liam Neeson is entertaining, but the story is very much a typical formula. Worth watching if you are in the mood to see the good guy win at the end and do not want to put a lot of thought into a movie."
2,Forced and dreary fiction,"I went into this book thinking that I would be captured by its originality and sentimentality, but found neither. The story was trite and exploitative. In addition, it almost entirely left out the decedent's blood relatives, which is curious given the circumstance's of Jay's death.Finally, the insertion of the uncompleted portion's of Mr. Agee's writings was forced. It was written in a different voice as although not meant to be part of the same work. An unfortunate editorial decision to include it."
5,A perfect book in many ways,"A Death in the Family is devastating and heart-breaking and a perfect narrative. Anyone who has suffered a shocking loss experiences many emotions and may not know how to give voice to them; Agee finds a way to express them in sharply tuned phrases and precise observations. Although written many years ago, this book is not dated in any way. I was stunned by the prose - the careful use of words, the economy of sentences and the attention to important details. Impressive."
3,Seemed unfinished,"A good story as far as it goes, this book ended abruptly without bringing everything yo a satisfying end. Perhaps the writer had that in mind since it is a tale of death. Still, I thought just a little synopsis of the family was have drawn it to a real end."
2,disappointing,"Having learned hiragana from the brilliant James Heisig's book, I was happy to see in the review that this book claims to use the same ""mnemonics"" method of helping memorise the shapes of katakana characters . Indeed, characters in this book are superimposed over pictures. However, in nearly all cases the pictures have very little to do with what the character looks like (imagine a picture of a person twisted in a very bizzarre way that stands for ""centurion"" (SE)).Practice examples are interesting to read as they give tidbits of japanese culture, but they all imply the knowledge of characters that have not been covered yet, making following them extremely painful, and there are not enough of them at all.Rather than taking a character apart and seeing what parts it consists of, the book just lists them in alphabetical (a-ka-sa-ta) order without trying to find any kind of relation between them.You are definitely better off waiting for Heisig's katakana book"
3,I'm Watching You,Good Book. Keeps with the tone of other Karen Rose books. I started in the middle of the series and have just gone back to the start.
4,Nice Talent,"I came to this album through Stuart Davis, another Peppermint guitarist from the midwest. This is my first BW album, which I originally explored via .mp3, before purchase. Having lived in the same geography as she, I am suprised by her width of mind in exploring many ideas openly. I would more likely have placed her into a Massachusetts-Dar Williams-Boston folkie group. But hers is more that that. Clean, peppy, well played, and insightful, I enjoy her work as much as Suzanne Vega, perhaps Ani Difranco, or Dar herself. Kudos on a fine album. Not Prokoffiev, but then, this is not what she is attempting. I enjoy it very much; many artists do things that rub me wrong somehow, but her lyrics and chord structures are unfailingly sympathatic and stimulating to my ear. I recommend her to astute listeners interested in clarifying how their world feels to them, and look forward to more of her work."
5,Intelligent Read,Ms. Parker has a reporter's knack for relating tales. She approaches the stories with a sense of adventure and history and handles each one professionally and respectfully. I look forward to reading more Southern ghost stories from her.

3,Mr Floppy Arm would be a better name.,"Well, it does extend, as advertised. But how usefully is debatable. Mainly because when fully extended it was very flexible, to the extent that a 16 oz can of insect spray on the end was barely manageable. If its not extended over half way it works OK with a minimum of flopping around. I'm not sending it back because it is better than nothing, but don't expect to to do a lot with it fully extended to 12 ft. More like 9-10 ft is the max in my opinion."
3,Concern over the substances for making the pole,"Unlike other products in this website, the product details here show the proposition 65 warning. Does this suggest the extension pole contain toxic substances ? So I'm hesitating whether it's safe to buy it."
3,AVD-263 Battery,"I purchased 2 batterys and a charger last year and 1 of the batteries wouldn't hold a charge, but I am going to try another one. The one that works is a very good battery."
4,"Tips on preparing for a voyage, voyaging, and enjoying it!","This book follows the yachts and events surrounding an around the world cruising rally. The story, on the surface, is one of playful extranvegance. It is about rich people having fun on sailboats.Sailors will read the book at another level. What was the outcome of all those preparations? How did perception match up with reality? What works and what doesn't? All the information is right there for sailors to absorb.This writer's take-away: keep it simple and keep it fun.Next time sailors gather at a yacht club to talk about preparing for the big voyage; readers of this book will be able to chime in with authority."
5,Any of the Fulves Self Working books,"Hi; Whether you are a beginner or experienced magician, you will find a wealth of great magic in these books, especially if you enjoy the subtle (sneaky!) instead of complicated sleight-of-hand."
2,Not ready for Prime Time,"This product seems like a great idea but I ended up returning it. I bought it so my girlfriend can get to her schoolwork on my computer or her laptop and also use the printer without mine being on. The web access seems neat too, but the problem with this product is in the interface. I could see her eyes glaze over when I showed her what she needed to do to use this. I know not everyone wants this, but give me a program she (or someone's parents or children) can open up and understand how to use and I'll buy it. Also had a fan error and was unable to connect to the drive after first day of use, did firmware and software updates for Vista and got my data back from it...scary! This is supposed to be my backup? Not reliable in my opinion."
4,Great little phone cover,"This is a great little phone cover!!! It's pretty much just what I expected except that some of the black color has started to rub off on parts of it so it has specks of white in some areas. However, considering what I paid, I am hardly too upset."
5,Value servic e,"Excellent product, very good price, reasonable delivery charge and fast delivery. Ease of ordering.Thank you Amazon, may you live long."
5,Wow!,"This little thing is really a gem! I'm shocked at how much math a $20 calculator can do. Really helped me get through the FE as this thing solves quadratic & cubic equations, and even does numeric integration and differentiation! A very well designed tool."
4,Good book to start SAT prep,A friend introduced this book to my kid and she seems to enjoy reading it and start picking up vacabuary. It is good starter book.
4,Epidemiology for the non-epidemiologist,"The author (who has been a prominent investigator in cancer epidemiology for many years) has written a ""primer"" on epidemiology for the rest of us. Taking a no non-sense approach to a complex subject, he uses humor and easy to understand concepts to make his subject matter both enjoyable and enlightening. This is a booklet for managers, lawyers, and those in the health sciences who need a jumpstart refresher ASAP."
2,Great performance. Poor sound.,"This review is related to the Japanease release (mini-LP replica) of Swiss Movement.This is one of the greatest jazz performances. Spirit. Soul. Life. Drum. Ecstasy. But the sound quality is of big questione. Yes, it is dated to 60's. Yes, it was recorded at the concert. But the bonus track showcases how good the sound quality could have been on this release. On all other tracks you hear drums, keyboards and voice in your left channel and the horns in your right channel. Bass is almost not defined and is boom-boom box rather than a set of strings. The audience is in your right channel, too.This is a great piece of jazz (probably, a must have). But it is definitely not an audiophile record or even close to it."
3,Not what it seems to be.,"As a beard trimmer it is good. A mustache trimmer has a smaller head for detailing,this item has none. The name of this item is VERY deceiving. You cannot trim your mustache with the wide head."
2,"Awesome Trimmer, Lousy Power","It pains me to give this trimmer such a bad review. The trimmer itself is EXACTLY what I want. Great adjustments. Does a fantastic job on trimming everything from my beard to sideburns to whatever. However, here I am less than two years after my purchase and I am looking for another trimmer. Why? The battery has died. Worse, though it is described as ""corded/cordless"", it only works cordless. In other words, even though you can have the trimmer plugged in, it still runs on battery (which won't hold a charge anymore). I wouldn't mind if I could just plug in and use the trimmer corded but I can't. And the batteries aren't replaceable. Yes, I did follow the instructions on battery maintenance but nothing helps. Looking at the owner's manual, I see that the MB-300 does operate with AC. However, it doesn't look like they make it anymore (if they ever did) so I'm stuck. Does Remington really expect us to buy a new one of these every 18 months?"
5,Replaced,I bought this to replace my MB-10 which I had for 6 years. The first cut proved that I made the correct choice. Hope it lasts as long as my last Remington!!!!!
4,Good enough,I've been using one of these for about 2 months now & I'm satisfied with its performance. I use it once or twice a week to trim my beard & it's still running on the 1st day's charge. I'd recommend it.
1,Big Mistake,Did a big mistake buying this item. It would have been better if i had ordered my previous trimmer from Philips.
1,Dumb,"Not worth it, I was expecting something bet which would do the job but this is a regular type of sh*t you would buy form any store. Not worth it most of these other comments are regular stupid customers who just spend money and think that's what they wanted. Does not even do the job it's more of a shaving the head thing"
1,Worst Trimmer Ever!!,"This trimmer is horrible....it took me about 45 minutes just to get an even shave. If you have a really short beard then I suppose it will work fine for you. But if you have a beard around level 3 or higher, be prepared to stand there for at least half an hour trying to get an even shave."
2,Battery life disappointing,"It's a fairly good trimmer but the batteries do not last very long. If I charge it and use it a few weeks later, it will not last as long as I need to trim my beard. You have to leave it plugged in charging all the time in order for it to be ready when you need it. I have had several Norelco shavers and none had this problem. In the future, I will probably look for the Norelco name. I thought Remington was probably a good name brand but now I am not so sure."
2,Disappointing,"Tried to like it but just can't. Doesn't come with a stand, battery drains quickly, doesn't work while plugged in so if you drain the battery you have to wait until it's fully charged to use it. Overall I would not recommend this product. Am searching for a new trimmer now."
5,Great Purchase!,"This trimmer has been great for trimming my beard/mustache. I like to keep it short, like the length it would be after not shaving for a few days, and this trimmer has an adjustment that is short enough for me (which many don't).The device works smoothly. It does not pull out any hairs, like some of my old trimmers, and the battery seems to last forever. I charged once it when I bought it a few months ago, and it is still working.Highly recommended."
1,Broke after about 6 months,The trimmer itself (which you have to remove to clean) has very cheap plastic taps that keep it on. I've had it less than 6 months and it has to be thrown away. I'd spend a bit more money for something better.
3,Be careful ...,"The product works wonderfully except that you must, must, must rake hair in through the comb in exactly the right way or else you'll gouge out huge chunks: the guard on the bottom side of the trimmer doesn't change its depth as you adjust it, instead always remaining almost flush with the bottom side. This is a dumb design flaw: one should be able to safely twist and turn a trimmer without ever having hair cut shorter than the chosen guard setting indicates."
3,not thought out,"trimmed beard, mustache and hair great! thought it had a lithium ion battery but it comes with a ni-cadbut seems to work just as good, only flaw as I see it, is the blade top where you lift it to clean hair only plastic pin hinges holding it on. they came out several times during cleaning"
3,Fine but I miss the old Remington with the built-in vacuum,"This works quite well and it was my way around buying other trimmers that come with a dizzying array of attachments. This has a simple adjustment wheel that changes the guard height. My old Remington had a genius vacuum built into the base to collect all those annoying beard trimming that otherwise land all over the sink, which also worked as a foot that you could set the trimmer up vertically. I miss that."
4,Good beard trimmer...battery begins to lose charge,Overall I'm very happy with this trimmer. The blades stayed sharp for the 2 years I've had it and it was very comfortable to use. The only con is the battery lost it's charge after about 2 years of use. It cannot even operate for more than a few minutes at this point. I got 2 years out of it and the price is cheap for a trimmer so that's why I gave it 4 stars.
5,Beard Trimmer MB-2000,"I recently had to grow a beard for a part in the play, Little Women. I need a full beard consistent with the 1860s period in which the play takes place. Since I play a distinguished gentleman, the beard had to be neatly trimmed. Rather than spend money on a barber or hair dresser, I decided to purchase an electric trimmer, which cost only as much as a single visit to a barber. I found it easy to use and wholly effective in giving my beard and mustache a well-tailored look, fully suited to the role. It will serve me for years to come, and was clearly a great investment."
4,Priced right,I've used this product several times to trim my beard and have been quite pleased with it. It cleans up much nicer than any other trimmer I've used too.
1,Piece of Garbage,"At first, I was happy with this beard trimmer. About 6-8 months later, it fell on the floor and a plastic piece broke off. Now I have it all taped up with duct tape to make it work. Cheap crap."
2,"Lasted for 7 uses, then battery went out","Its a decent trimmer but NOT very high quality - Used it maybe 7 times in two years, treated it w kid gloves but the battery one day refused to recharge. I'm going back to Braun or Philips - Its not my first bad experience w Remington....but its my last."
1,Terrible,"I purchased this a couple months ago. After no more than a dozen uses, it no longer holds a charge, and dies within seconds of being turned on."
4,Works fine,I've had this for a few weeks now. Its a good beard trimmer. Easy to adjust and clean. No complaints. Would buy again.
3,Decent but only lasted barely 2 years.,"It worked great and did a good job trimming my goatee while it worked. Not having a stand was no big deal but I would have liked it if you could use it plugged in while it charged and while the battery was dead. The battery died out on it a few weeks ago and no longer holds a charge after 1 year and 10 months of use. I only paid $15 for (now its $25)but I thought I would get more than almost 2 years of use. If Remington hoped I'd just buy another one, well they are right, but it won't be a Remington, I'll try another brand out, especially since its $10 more now."
1,WORST TRIMMER EVER,"If you wanna buy this trimmer, consider yourself buying a 3 hours trimmer. Cause after it's batter goes out, it never charges again!!!! i threw it away after the battery was out! there is no way to replace the battery as it can't be opened or anything. you just throw it away"
1,Not for traveling,The converter does not accept 240 voltage. That means you can't recharge it in most parts of the world. I bought it for a trip and haven't had a chance to use it yet because I can't charge it.There is no indication on the Amazon page that the converter has a limited voltage input.
2,Not satisfied,Does not cut well or evenly and does not have a vacuum feature as does the MB70. I would not order it again.
2,Not good for shaving/detailing,"Though marketed as a trimmer, I expected to be able to get a decent shave/detail out of this as well. With most trimmers you can remove the adjustable length setting part to shave off stubble and/or detail your facial hair. Not the case here. Even with the adjustable head removed, there is a good few millimeters gap between the blades and the guard, preventing you from getting even a modestly close shave. Not what I was expecting."
2,"dropped it once, cracked head",This worked great until I dropped it once. A plastic tab broke off and the length attachments don't stay on unless they're held in place now. It still works.. duct tape might help.
1,L A M E,you can not directly plug it and use it. you have to let it charge for an hour!built quality is okaish. very frustrated and disappointing :(
4,Good shaver,"Not much to report - the price is good, and it works just fine. All the controls are easy to use and it's comfortable. The only downside is there's no vacuum to suck up the whiskers, but models with that feature are more expensive."
