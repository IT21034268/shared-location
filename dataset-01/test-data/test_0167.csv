1,Do not buy this even if your life depends on it!,I have bought two of these both of them do not work now. It is a piece of junk. If your life depended on you using this don't it will short out on you.
2,This Book is Silly,"The characters in this book and their interactions are really inane. I kept reading thinking that the book was bound to get better, but if anything the plot situations got even sillier as the book progressed. It seemed that even the author lost interest. Very weak writing."
4,A little known history.,"There has been a limited amount of information available about the only part of England to be invaded and occupied. Osprey Publishing has once again managed to put together a brief, but through overview of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The photographs and colored drawings give you a good idea of the effort put into fortification of the Channel Islands, including a number of fortifications only found on the Channel Islands."
4,Good deal,"The unit was as described and works well. I wish the volume could go up just a smidge higher, but otherwise it works well."
1,Geez ......,"I really do enjoy reading books about life in college, but to tell you the truth...this one is horrible. Karo has no idea what a real college experience is like. To be honest, I think he stayed in his dorm room the whole time and based his opinions on what he's ""heard"" about college life. If you want to read something that will really make you laugh and remember all your favorite college experiences, read Steve Hofstetter's ""Student Body Shots"" instead. Now THAT is a great book. If you don't laugh from start to finish, you've probably got a sense of humor like Karo, i.e. NONE."
2,save your $$,"Wow, is this bad!! Makes me wonder exactly who at Simon & Schuster went to Penn with this unfunny clown. Karo's only talents seem to be a mastery of the obvious, and the ability to get someone to give him a book deal. Do yourself a favor--use the [money] you were going to spend on this book to buy a notbook and some pens. You'll write just as good a book as this one. Oh, and if anyone at S&S went to Tulane, let me know. I can write pages of this [stuff]"
4,Fantastic Device,"I've been using the Illuminator for at least 20 years. It's light on the wrist, tells accurate time, has a stop watch and an alarm AND as an extra benefit can be illuminated for late-night time telling in the dark. The watch's ""illuminator"" is so strong it casts enough light in a dark room, tent or outdoors to see your way or to identify objects. It's cheap which means no tears shed when the battery wears out after a year or so or if it's lost (as has happened from time to time). I've been buying these for friends who, like me, view a watch as a tool rather than a piece of jewelry. My only caution is if you have a really large wrist, it may not fit. But, for $13 or $14 you can always give it to your kid. Great for guys who spend a lot of time outdoors for recreation or work. Durable and can take occasional immersions in water."
2,Not what I expected,This book is full of multiple choice questions. It is not what I expected or needed to study for PRAXIS II.
5,Awesome Book,"This book is drop dead gorgeous and extremely informative, read it cover to cover in one sitting. Highly recommended to anyone interested in Japanese culture!!"
2,If Gradgrind taught Latin...,"This book is recommended for those who are more interested in charting and graphing sentences than learning Latin. The focus is primarily upon dismantling sentences and placing them on ""kernal charts,"" with little or no emphasis on reading. The ""basic sentences"" frequently contain material not yet covered. It is poorly glossed. In its favor, the book moves relatively slowly through paradigms, addressing the cases as need arises. And, if one works through the book, one is likely to accidently learn some Latin. However, the same end could be reached with almost any other book. I know half a dozen other languages, and have never seen a less efficient textbook. Like Gradgrind, the authors of this text seem hellbent on making certain that learning Latin is not tainted by pleasure. Despite wonderful instructors, this book left me with a dread of approaching Latin class."
1,Stopped Working After Two Months,"My iFM worked great on my iPod Photo. It was a convenient compact size, and had great FM reception even inside buildings. I also used it to record FM radio. I used it about two or three times per week for two months when suddenly the FM radio only received static. It simply stopped receiving FM. I ONLY used this FM receiver indoors at my health club, and never abused it in any way. Boo to Griffin for such a weak product."
2,Do not use in Senseo,We bought these for the Senseo- the ad says it is compatable but its not! Buyers beware- I almost broke my Senseo trying to use them- The Senseo got stuck closed and I had to wait for it to let go of the vacuum. I think its because there is more coffee in these.
3,slightly better than average,"the only reason why this is better than Average to me is because of EarthQuake. he stole the show.Sommore was entertaining. Bruce,Bruce had moments as well. everything else was so-so to corny.but EarthQuake had me rolling from start to finish."
3,"3 1/2 stars,actually","I really wanted to check this out,because I love The Original Kings Of Comedy,and I had heard routines from J. Anthony Brown and Earthquake that I liked.It was good,but The Original Kings of Comedy is better.I was greatly dissapointed with J.Anthony Brown's routine.He did not tell any good jokes,all he did was cuss.D.L. Hughley's performance was good,but I have heard better from this King Of Comedy.I am generally not a fan of black female comedians,but Sommore gives a very funny performance.Bruce Bruce gives a very funny performance.I like the way he tells the audience that he just goes off the stage,and then he leaves.He is not clean like Walter Latham says he is.Rickey Smiley is not clean either.He tells some decent jokes.My favorite comic on here is definitely Earthquake.I love his joke about Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.(You know how hard it is to find someone to cook your crack cocaine the way you like it?)Overall,this is good,but the Kings of Comedy are better."
5,I loved this book!!,This is a very well written story that is both funny and sad at the same time. You don't have to be a dog lover to enjoy this book. I hope Ms. thomas writes more books. She is a very talented author.
4,Emotional and moving read,"While on a walk with their dog one night, Abigail Thomas's husband was hit by a car. He survived the accident, but it left him with memory loss, hallucinations, and wild rages so severe that he had to be institutionalized. This tragedy would destroy most relationships. But Thomas did not abandon her husband. Instead, she sold her apartment and moved to be closer to him. Then she got two more dogs to keep her company. The title of this inspirational book of essays about the couple's experiences comes from an aboriginal phrase that describes the practice of cuddling with dogs on a frigid night. If it was a particularly cold night, it would take 3 dogs to keep you warm. Reading this book will warm your heart."
4,Courage Interrupted,Everything about this book appealed to me from the start including the cover. It was uplifting to read of the author's courage and tenacity when it came to protecting her spouse who could no longer look after himself. I wish I could say my review of the book is complete however my 2 year Aussie also enjoyed the book and ate the rest--so what happens after she moves to Woodstock? You can bet I'll be ordering another copy to hear the rest of the story.
3,not really about the dogs,This book was okay. I thought it sounded interesting so I bought it. Not so interesting once I started reading it.Dont let the title fool you its not really about the dogs at. The story just coasts along no depth to it at all
2,Labtec Computer Microphone,Well I pretty much bought this mic because it is cheap.. and i wanted to video chat. Well I can understand why it is cheap cause it barely works. The only way to let the other person hear me is to hold it up to my mouth at least an inch away even then I have to speak louder than usual. But if you are looking for a cheap mic and u dont mind doing that then be my guest.
3,Nice Looking but Pretty Big,"The magnet is nice looking with good color. However, make sure you have enough FLAT area on your car to place this. It is rather large for many vehicles consideringh te contours most vehicles have. I suggest getting the ruler out and checking beforehand. We placed it on our vehicle over one of the coutoured areas and the magnet was gone in days."
4,I AM SATISFIED,"I DID NOT EXPECT THAT CASIO PRODUCES SUCH GOOD QUALITY WATCHES. THIS WATCH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT SEEMS IN THE PHOTO. IT IS SHINNY AND VERY HEAVY. THATS A VERY GOOD MANUFATURING PRODUCT. BEAUTIFUL AS IT COMBINES ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL READINGS. AND I AM SURE THAT THIS WATCH WILL LAST FOR A LIFE AS ALL MY OTHER CASIO WATCHES WHICH I BOUGHT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STILL ARE WORKING. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE FOR SUCH A FANTASTIC WATCH. JUST 50 DOLLARS? IN GREECE WE SAY ""DON'T EVEN SAY IT TO THE PRIEST"""
5,Awsome Cool looking watch,Really cool watch... Nice digital background.May be Casio should include more details in manual about how to take the extra links outs from the bracelet. I kinda figured that out in about 10 mins. Which could have been saved. no biggie!!!
4,Excelente,"Excelente producto, muy bonito, se ve muy formal, todas las funciones trabajan a la perfecci√≥n, es muy elegante, recomiendo lo compren"
4,Great Watch,"For the price, this is a great watch. I am not sure why, someone would say that it is not a work watch, mine survived a deployment to Iraq, with an IED. My only issue was with the amount of traveling I did, I had to set the time too much, it became a little difficult changing the analog time."
5,How I spent my Christmas Break,"Ok, so let me just say that I just finished reading Volume Four of the Black Books series and I loved it just as much as I love all the others. I received the first one as a present and had to rush and get the rest just so I could find out what happens. If you are reading this, than you are probably like me and want to know if the answers to all the questions that have been buildng up over the first three installments will ever appear and all I can say is ""Yes, definitly, Yes!!!"" If you have a doubt in your mind about getting this book then you should erase it immediately, because in the end you finally understand everything. I'm not saying that you won't still be wishing for a fifth volume once you are done reading, but all your big questions will be answered, and in my opinion they are answered in a good way. So in short I loved it!"
1,Pranic illusion,"Pranic illusion! 2012 the soul will move closer to the human form than ever before and thats it! What will happen is that truth will arise and manifest in ways it never could before and this will come in the form of a rise in illness/disease. (particularly mental as it is already) Why? because what is held emotionally and not healed will manifest itself within the body to be released. The soul is about truth. No glamour or illusion or panderingTrust no teaching (or channelling)that first doesn't tell you that there exists pranic light and soulful light (illusion/soul) or that you are not first a soulful being! or any modality that wishes to place its energy within you, or move you from your centre of stillness."
4,Goal! - The Dream Begins,This movie has a great plot. If you enjoy soccer...you will like the movie...if not...forget it...because it deals a lot with the sport. The lead actor is excellent...and so is the rest of the cast. It tells the story of a boy who dreams of becoming the best...and works very hard at achieving these goals.
3,OK Movie,"This movie was alright. I would have preferred an actual player to play this role. Honestly, I was kinda let down by the obvious lack of skill at futbol. The story line was not too bad. Decent acting but nothing to get too excited about."
4,"Wonderful, Uplifting Film","It drags in places - only negative comment. Other than that - it is truly wonderful. Great story - about family, courage, persistence, disappointment, and the real meaning of victory. Love it."
4,A good soccer movie.,"There aren't a whole lot of options out there for soccer fans, which makes this movie all the more worth seeing!I found myself surprised ... I was prepared for a sappy story with all the predictable cliches. Rags to riches, kid works hard, boy gets girl, yadda yadda. What I didn't expect was above average acting, great locations (Newcastle and London), realistic soccer action, and even a few twists and turns.It's not the greatest film ever made, but it is certainly above average. Enjoy!"
4,Good for soccer fans (including young ones),"I watched this with my 10 and 12-year old kids (both play youth soccer), and was pleasantly surprised: little to no objectionable material, and some really cool soccer moves. The story line was plausible, and the message was sweet. On the downside, the movie did drag a bit through the middle and the character development was pretty shallow, but that made it accessible to younger audiences.All three of us would recommend this movie (especially for a buck-ninety-nine)."
3,Cute,"Cute and absorbant. They shed in the wash the first few times. Velcro back (eh) and the length while handy at times, can also be cumbersome. My baby did get a ton of adoring compliments for it's originality when she wore it though!"
4,background music for a romantic evening,"Michael Bolton is in his element in tossing off this 2003 collection--a very short one, it must be said--of fine old bluesy-romantic pieces. Gone for the moment is the flamboyant wall of musicians that backs up his more anthemic rock and roll pieces. The music here is supplied by a diminutive assortment of soft-spoken instrumentalist. All that's missing is a smoky stage and a cover charge.It's enough to get a man to wondering about the possibilities that Bolton and, say, Diana Krall might team up on a similar collection in the future. Bolton, truth be told, needs the variety a second voice would bring to this style of intimate singing. His voice is distinctive, strong, assured, but not supple. The give-and-take of a duet would raise the bar here.Bolton always assembles the best available package to make the music that happens behind him. The result? A light, appealing, exceedingly short tribute to songs well written, long ago."
5,Fabulous!!!,"This is one of the best collections I have heard in a long while. I got goosebumps! If you love vintage, you can't go wrong with Michael Bolton. He is AT HIS BEST!"
1,Not a Musician,"Michael Bolton makes bastardized melodies. This isn't music and to those who think it is, may God have mercy on your souls. Don't support his albums because I heard that he's a pretty big jerk in all actuality."
3,This set is NOT widescreen,"I got this set, and Amazon is wrong - these 3 discs are NOT in widescreen format. Based on some reviews I've seen for the ""America's Game"" DVDs for other teams, I am pretty sure that none of them are in widescreen format. That's too bad - the NFL shows the ""America's Game"" broadcasts on the NFL Network in widescreen format, so why can't they put the widescreen format on DVD?"
5,Great printer !,"Its lightweight, good looking, pretty fast, and prints great photos. Its USB connection is quite fast, its got a convenient paper input, paper output tray. The software supplied is great,especially for photos. Doesnt occupy too much of space. Simple to operate with just two buttons. I feel its pretty good for personal use in home or for students.But it does make I think more amount of noise. This could have been better done with.I have always liked Epson printers because they use a differnt technology than thermal inkjet printers, they give better resolution and ink dries quicker. the cartridges are also cheaper than HP. After all, in the long run, the cartridge cost matters much more than the initial cost of the printer.On the whole, I feel its a winner with the 49.99 dollar price tag right now with the rebate. But yeah, as with most printers, it doesnt ship with a USB cable. But it includes both black and color ink cartridges."
1,"these printers ""stink""",I now have three of these ... printers at my store because they quickly run out of ink and have trouble installing new ones without running numerous clean processes which waste all the ink and force you to buy new cartridges. I installed new cartridges and the black worked fine but the color was missing lines and after about ten cleaning cycles the color started working but the black had run out of ink. Seems like a scam by Epson to sell ink cartridegs.
1,Needed Items Not Included,"6 months later I still haven't had the time to install the printer. Literature didn't tell me it only had USB interface, it didn't come with the USB cable or ink."
2,No better than the first,"If you liked the first compilation, you should like the second. I didn't like the first one and don't like the second. Why is it the sword that is always supposes to be with Katsumi is never with her- especially in times where she needs it, such as getting trapped on a train. Why is it Katsumi has such a negative attitude toward killing those with her own blood? This seems to be a very exaggerated reaction... I still feel they could have put a little more action in these episodes with less corny love stories."
3,YOU GOTTA BE SH______G ME!,"RATED PG=PURE GARBAGE! Yes, I remember watching this on TV. Three pilots..the family man..religious guy..and of course the ""I'm soooo hot"" cocky guy.....all competing for the ""Top Gun Award"" Yes there is great footage...especially in the cockpit. (would of liked to see more of the human centrifuge) there's one incident that I just don't understand and that is how can the Airforce let a pilot who failed the simulator training test TWICE (oh yeah..I forgot...he's hot....NOT! ???)climb into a $million$ jet..SOLO! Also..why did they ""bleep"" when the pilots said naughty words? What's that about?..its a DVD??? Funny..I was at an airshow and every pilot I asked about this DVD never even heard of it! ...so if you like those ""Hollywood type"" movies then go ahead and watch..if not don't bother."
5,Simple yet extremely effective and motivating,In my view one of the best books to get started with Yoga. I was able to do most exercises and I could feel the benefits immediately. I liked the philosophy the breathing exercises and also the poems in there. I guess only a real svami could give such a broad insight and produce such an excellent real life yoga manual.
1,BAD NEWS,This charger doesn't even work! I tried numerous ipods and none of them charged with this device!
5,Jazz trio,This is an excellent jazz group that has a full sound dispite being a trio. I recommend it for anyone who loves jazz.
1,VOC's galore..,"I bought two of these dividers for my space to try to break up my studio apartment. The smell of volitile organic compounds used in the glue and/or paint reaked so badly that I physically wasn't able to stand using it inside my apartment. I note they come direct from China which may/may not have a bearing on the substances used in manufacture.. Anyways, I therefore left them in my friend's garage for almost 2 months, and the smell seems to have mostly left, but I'm still not overly impressed.I would recommend anyone looking for a partition to consider the rice paper dividers over these, even without the smell. They allow diffused light to pass through which minimises shading and are aesthetically nicer with a better finish."
1,"Works great for a week...then, not so great","I went through two of these headsets, after about 2 weeks, I would start getting low-battery beeps after an hour or so of standby.The headset would buzz to the person on the other end of the call, and I had to just dump it.Logitech support was helpful, particularly when I called them from the headset and they heard the buzzing. They sent the first replacement right away, I didn't bother with replacing the second unit."
3,"Good product, but...","I like the way the headset fits on my ear; the ""fork"" thing seems to suit me better and is more positive than the over the ear hooks used by everybody else. The *problem* is that on my example the screw holding the fork together didn't work well and stripped its threads, so the fork fell apart. The headset works well electronically, though."
5,my favorite Moore book,"My first Christopher Moore book, and my favorite still. Will make you LOL! After this read Fluke and Lamb, they are fantastic too. You Suck was good, I just finished The lust lizard of melancholy cove, it was not Mr. Moore's best work, I'd avoid that one. Next on the list Practical Demon keeping and I'm hoping for another winner!"
4,I've found another darkly funny author to kindle! Weeeeeee!,"Moore's darkly funny humor makes this a must read. Skillfully crafted, colorful characters put in impossible situations; a sweet young man who falls in love with a vampire. Not a very good one either, she was bitten hours before they met, but hey, she's hot. And then there's the 'Animals', a group of fun loving, partying down, pot smoking, beer drinking, gun toting buds who work the night shift at your local grocery store. Do they get the job done? Ah - Kindasorta - well not so much, but it's funny as hell watching them try. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention 'The Emperor', a street person, with two k-9 sidekicks, one of which has the uncanny ability to sniff out vampires. Now this could come in handy with a killer on the loose, bodies turning up blood drained and all.Just one laugh after another - I give Bloodsucking Fiends 4 stars out of 5. I'll be visiting this author again.Susan Stec, author, The Grateful Undead: They're so Vein"
3,More good Moore,"Another wacky tale. Funny as usual. If you need a good laugh, Moore does not dissapoint."
3,for Anne Rice fans that need a FREAKIN' SENSE OF HUMOR,"This was a bit of an odd read for me. On the one hand, it's this off-kilter cliche of a love-story between a vampire and her mortal host. And on the other, it's a borderline satire of Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite. Moore does a few interesting things in his treatment of the genre (and the vampire mythos more generally). Entertaining (and quite amusing at moment (e.g., TURKEY BOWLING!)) and worth the read."
3,Very comprehensive coverage,This book covers the CISA topics in a very comprehensive manner. I used it to prepare for the CISA examination (and passed the exam.) The only criticism I have is that does not focus on the important topics. All topics are covered in great detail so the reader is left to seperate the wheat from the chaff.
5,An excellent movie about a great politician,"I saw Sadat back in 1993. I was impressed with his skill as a politician, how he survived, though despised, under Gamal Abdel Nasser, when his peers were taken away one by one, and later as Egypt's leader as the first Arab nation in achieving the highly unpopular yet sorely needed peace with Israel.This movie is a bit long (2 VHS). I would recommend to set aside at least 5 hrs with breaks to see it in one seating.I feel the movie brings out what a true great politician is supposed to be: someone able to negotiate through difficult circumstances and great opposition, bidding his time to achieve a worthy goal.I highly recommend this movie. It could even have a place in a college-level Political Science course!P.S.: I wish they would reissue it as DVDs. It is a classic."
3,Informative but fast,The movie was very informative but because of time ristrictions it skipped a lot of critical events in Sadat's life. Some events in the movie can be argued but the movie was well acted out and directed.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Narc's screenplay is built on a solid foundation of cliches, the powerhouse performances, gritty camerawork, and inspired use of location (Detroit *feels* cold and lonely in the film) allow the film to rise above its tired screenplay."
2,Good Story - Bad Directing,"It really is a shame, this has a really good story line. I think the director took alot away from the story, way over directed, should have left the movie roll on its own. Some of the camera scenes added were just there for effect, took from a very good story line."
3,No Serpico,"This film was good--despite the hype--but not great and, sorry, not even close to ""Serpico"" or ""French Connection"" despite gritty cinimatography and a fine cast. Plot-wise, I'm wondering why the Ray Liota Character bothered to persue anyone else once his superior told him the ""killer"" was the first punk he shot, If in the end all he wanted to do was protect the wife and little girl of his ""Slain"" partner. (did I miss something?) This all leads me to my main beef and that is why is every film now adays reducable to that theme: survival of the middle class family unit. Heck, Serpico was too obsessed and self-involved to keep a girl friend let alone a family. Popeye Doyle never graduated from one-night stands. I think there's a trend here so prevelent in contemporary film that I feel like the powers that be are trying to minipulate us...Give me Seventies cop stuff any day."
5,Good Product,My husband says it is just awesome. He loves it. And it made a wonderful birthday present for him.
1,Long list of health precautions on this product,"I ordered the individual packets of this product and was sent this large container of wipes instead (a Marketplace dealer sent me the wrong product intentionally, and now I'll have to ship it back at my own expense). Anyway, I just want to warn parents of small children that this product appears very hazardous to humans. Probably it's better to have a phone with germs than to use a product with so many safety precautions. They even warn you not to use the bathroom after using the product without washing your hands first....."
5,The Best Damn Book In Town!,Extremely fortunate to have worked with Smokey during our years at Circle Track Magazine and all his years at PRI (Performance Racing Industry).THIS IS INDEED THE BEST DAMN BOOK IN TOWN. You'll love it.
5,Rare Encounters,"Of The many books on the subject I've read over the years, this one is valuable for its coverage of Asian encounters. Many of which are rarely published anywhere else. Covers North America's Bigfoot as well, but the Yeti and Almas stories are most prominent here. A book that took me so long to get around to"
1,Warning: Be careful of who cannot use this!,"I was very excited to recieve this to help my mother's circulation. I read all of the material I could get on this and not once is there a warning on who can or cannot use this. So pay attention folks:Do not use if you have a pacemaker, have had, currently have or might have heart or vascular problems, high blood pressure, or are recovering from injury or surgery.I was very disappointed thinking this would be wonderful on my mothers legs but, since she has a pacemaker she cannot use. It could damage the pacemaker and or could cause a blood clot.I wish this reveiew was up here before I purchased it!"
2,Air Massage Boots,It did not meet my expectations. The massage did not relieve the pains in my legs.Air Press - Air Massage Boots - Leg Massager
2,Thigh tourniquet,"As everyone else has mentioned, these suits run small. I found they run even smaller than I could have imagined. Talk about tight thighs! I normally wear a size 30, so I ordered a size 32. Even these were too small to wear. I would have to wear a size 34 to be comfortable, and I wasn't about to order that. I also found the material to be a little irritating. I might not notice it for a short workout, but for longer stays in the pool, it might be a bit uncomfortable. Returned these bad boys in a flash."
2,Very short life,Pros:Size is about right and looks good when it was new.Cons:It only took a few weeks (2-3 months) to discolor (balck has changed to bownish). People is telling me they now can see through from my back.
4,Awesome bather!,"This is such a great product! Its a must have for when sponge bathing newborns, and it works great to sit in the tub or a large sink once the baby can be emerged in water. I didn't want a traditional baby tub, because my kitchen is too large and drafty to bathe an infant comfortably. I wanted something that I could put in my own bathtub, and this is perfect. It dries quickly and its great to take along on weekend visits to the grandparents', too!"
1,Mildew,I may have gotten a lemon on this one but after just one bath I was already getting mildew just from hanging it in the shower. Weird.
4,"good padding, hard to wring","I bought this bather based on the good ratings. Pros: 1. good for small infants/preemies, because it cradles them. 2. Dries pretty quickly. Con: You have to wring out the excess water after you're done, and it's kind of hard because the pad gets heavily filled with water.Overall, I'm pleased with the product."
2,am I the only one who disliked this product?,Not very sanitary. The first time I used it my baby pooped on it and I had to wash it. It washed up horribly. I don't want to throw this in the washing machine every time I give my baby a bath.
3,Okay for infants under 4 mos.,"Good for newborns to bath in the sink, but babies will quickly outgrow it - especially when they start wiggling. I got it because it was soft and not hard plastic. My son has quickly outgrown it now that he's 4 months old. He wriggles alot now so it is tough to bath him in it. I would recommend the Euro bath, just put a towel on the bottom for newborns to make it more soft and comfy."
3,Mildew!,After only a couple uses it started to smell like mildew. And I always washed it out and hung it up to dry after using it. Other than that it was a big help.
5,Baby loves it!!,At 1 mo old didn't cry fr baths. Covered his belly with a wet washcloth and he just smiles and coos. Can't beat the softness of this bath cushion.
1,Not for Big Babies,"The picture is very deceiving! It looks like it holds a baby that is at least a couple of months old, with his head safely elevated, in a fair amount of water. I've also read reviews that indicate people use this with 5 and 6 month old babies. My 15 pound 10 week old barely fits on it! It was so small, not what I expected at all. It is more of a pillow than a tub. It is also very flat and does not keep the baby very elevated in the tub. It does seem like it may be nice for sponge bathing a new born though."
2,Comfy but got smelly really fast,"I initially loved this, but even though we squeezed all of the water out of it and hung it to dry every time we used it, it never quite dried. As a result, it started stinking and got discolored within the first month we owned it. I'm really disappointed, because otherwise I loved this product and so did my baby."
5,Highly Recommended!,I ordered this Bath Pad when my daughter was born almost six years ago and used it for the first few months. It's an excellent product to use from birth onwards. I never had to worry about water going in her eyes or mouth as the pad keeps the head elevated. Now I bought another one for my second child and have been using it everyday. Highly Recommended!
4,a miracle with my first,"My oldest loved to lay on this thing and listen to the water so I could have her with me and take a nice long hot shower as a single mom, it was my single most favorite product. My new baby does not like the sound or feel of shower water and isn't too keen on being naked either so this isn't quite the same but it still functions really well as a safe place to lay her and clean her up and putting her on it at an angle with warm bath water just up over her tummy her seems to get her to push out gas that is bothering her."
2,Waste of money!,The bath was comfortable for my baby and he enjoyed it. But after 20 uses it reeked. I followed directions on how to clean it and it still stunk. Also it shed little lint balls. I now have a basic baby plastic seat where you slip the baby's legs through. It is a lot cleaner then this cloth bath.
4,comfy and cozy!,"I bought this item based on reviews that I had read here, and I have to say I was thoroughly satisfied. The product is made well, so that it contours my baby's body and keeps her so cozy and comfortable! It's pillow-like and dries nicely. I will say, though, that the picture was a little misleading for me, because I thought that this item is shaped in a seat-like form, so that my baby's head would be inclined in the bathbub while the rest of her is covered in water. Instead, it lies flat so that the baby's body is not fully covered. Still, I really liked it."
1,do not attempt to clean/keep mildew-free,"liked bather at first, but when began to mildew and we FOLLOWED MFR'S INSTRUCTIONS, completely ""pilled"" and filling clumped. our baby is allergic, so things need to be clean for him. MFR was not interested in hearing our concerns either."
5,Great Item--from sink to tub.,This fit perfectly in our single basin sink and we used it from our sons first bath on. Now we use it in the big bathtub. You definatly need a good place to hang it to dry but other than that I can't imagine having anyproblems with it. It makes sink bathing much easier and safer in my opinion and more comfortable for the baby.
1,give my girls a rash!,I liked using this for my premiee baby girl once she grew out of her NICU bath at home but after a few months use it gave her a rash on her back. I didn't think it was the bath pad giving her the rash until her 3 year old sister started to get the same rash on her bottom because she liked to sit on it after my baby girl got out. I would not reccomend this product.
3,Great toy - bad price,"Both of my boys (1 and 3) absolutely love these trucks so it was a no-brainer baby gift idea for friends. I purchased off of Amazon thinking they would be priced well but a week later, I saw them at Babies R Us for half the price(not on sale). The BRUS price is $15-$16 but the amazon price was $30.They are a great, durable toy but don't spend $30 on one!"
2,Krakatoa ruined by DVD release,"For some reason I've always enjoyed Krakatoa having originally seen it in Cinerama.This DVD is frankly a disaster; many years ago Benny Hill did a sketch of a movie set on a boat that kept jumping. This is what the print on this DVD does all the time. Whereas Benny Hill was funny, this is not.The picture is weird to say the least; it is billed as Widescreen on the box but even when playing it in Widescreen on a Widescreen TV the picture is too squashed.The sound is not AC3 stereo although I thought it was clear.The film has been cut terribly and runs far short of the time billed on the DVD case.Don't bother with this awful print; let's hope the movie gets restored properly."
2,"The volcano blows, and so does this transfer","Okay, so it's not a work of art. But ""Krakatoa"" is very much a guilty pleasure. Max Schell and Sal Mineo pretty much phone in their performances. Diane Baker is trying so hard she seems like she's in a different movie. But where else are you going to see Brian Keith trying to rape a Polynesian pearl diver? The effects are clearly the star, with the tsunami tidal wave being fairly impressive, even by today's standards. It's a shame that we cannot get a better transfer of the complete 136 minute film. There are way too many obvious splices in this transfer to be acceptable. Also, this was released originally with a flaw that prevented it from being viewed unsqueezed. The flaw is corrected on the new pressing, but it has the same catalog number as the old pressing! The only way to tell them apart is that the new pressing has a white circle in the center, and the old one is clear."
3,krak mnt or tidal wave...,"movie just ok--too long, where best pt. is last apx 20mins of earth action of volcano/tidal wave-1 of the best tidal wave scenes. too bad the smart hero"" type brian keith made a dumb decison on this show to go to the nearest isle to the volc/tidal due to gettin the gold since he had less honored role in this film. more update poss. later."
3,Good Photography and Special Effects Poor DVD,"I really like the diverse cast of this movie. It makes this film work so well. And this is a very entertaining movie. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting is very effective and convincing for the adventure-disaster genre. I particularly liked the beautiful cinematography. Also, the script worked on many levels making it appealing to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and stimulating with great special effects. The only problem is the DVD transfer. I saw this on its initial release and the stereo sound was fantastic. The sound here is mediocre at best."
2,"sparked the disaster genre, but this is pretty bad","My son was clamoring to see this, so I finally got it. He likes volcanoes and action/adventure, so I thought it would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, it was so bad that he didn't want to watch it, even when the special effects ending was near.While I remember having seen this when it came out, I too was surprised at how crude the story line was, how few interesting characters there were, and how appalingly loose it was with the facts - afterall, Krakatoa is WEST of Java!!Thus, in spite of its spearheading the ""better"" disaster films (Towering Inferno, etc.) there is very little to recommend this film on any level."
2,krakatoa big bang,"I saw this movie at the theater when it came out and liked it immensly. I like a good movie with historical action, even if the story characters are lacking. I have the widescreen version and was a little disappointed in that some scenes were omitted which made the story line choppy. Overall, I believe if the omitted parts are included in the other versions, then it will be a good story to watch. The special effects are very good and worth getting the movie for.I rated this movie low because of the omitted parts and the editing for the widescreen version.( I believe various sources were used which affected quality)."
4,Great debut,"This is another great debut and like the first Nils Lofgren album was never followed up with as good an effort. There's not a bit of filler in it and while it doesn't contain a ""hit"", the songwriting is strong throughout. Highlights include, ""Goin' Down To Laurel"", ""What kinda Guy"" and ""It Isn't Gonna Be That Way"". Although he's put out several solid cd's since, his career never took off the way this album promised it might."
3,Alive On Arrival,"Need To Know what songs are on this CD..i cant find any info on this, and also are all the songs LIVE...please help"
4,"Great monster, hot cast, that's enough for me...","Okay, so I'm a sucker for anything Bigfoot / Yeti / Swamp Ape / Cryptozoological in nature. Those were my favorite X-File episodes. So I'm probably not very impartial when in comes to writing about videos such as this one. Does the film have plot problems, marginal acting, occassionally slow pacing and obvious budgetary constraints? Yes. But it also has a drop-dead gorgeous cast of guys and gals, and a pretty good Bigfoot-style monster. For me, that makes it enough to recommend!"
2,boggy creek the legend is true,"This movie was at best a waste of time. I enjoy ""B"" rated movies but this wasn't even a ""C"". I should have rented it before purchasing it."
1,Contender for Worst Ever,"There have been some bad horror movies with bigfoot in them. Some were bad in a good way that somehow makes them worth watching. This film is not one of that kind. It is the kind of bad that can sour a person on the whole subject. The acting was bad and the plot was worse. There is no way I can imagine someone reading the script for this film and thinking it should be made. Either they lost something due to budget or it was intended to rip-off people who would think it might be fun (in that good bad way) like the original Boggy Creek. I'm thinkng it is more of a rip-off. Rent it cheap if you think I might be wrong. You'll regret the lost time and the cheap rental fee, but at least you will save a bit compared to owning it. Better yet, avoid it."
2,It's a 10x loupe with good clarity.,"Beware that it is NOT 30x. It's in fact a 10x loupe. Other than that, it's a good quality 10x loupe. Hope Amazon can correct this."
2,Not Worth The $$$,"As others have noted, not 30x. Image is upside down. Extra margin around lens so its not even 21mm.This magnifier is no better than than the 10x at a third the price."
5,"Franco Bonisolli, his way.... an excellent way!!!","I have known Franco Bonisolli in the summer of 2002.in this recording it was not in form, cooled or feverish. His voice is not in the great form. This show still more his Greatness!!!!! A lot of people, singers, other tenors, critical, they don't say well of him. Certainly is normal! How to be able to speak well of a person as us (Bonisolli) that he sings as a god (Bonisolli)? I sing, but Bonisolli sings in divine way, Bonisolli is a man! I am also a man! Say Bonisolli is a god of the sing would be as to say I am incapable!!!!! Bonisolli show us his way.... I say the great way and the only way to sing."
2,Lacks substance,"I have to agree with the last reviewer, that this book is a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps that is due more to my expectations of the book than the actual content. What I was looking for was concrete techniques to assist in raising children bilingually, with information backed up by research from the field. There is a large amount of research on the topic of bilingualism, and it would be nice to find it summarized in a single volume. However, this is a series of excerpts taken from various parents in bilingual situations together with reasonably obvious statements, with little relation to linguistic research. While the various opinions from parents were interesting, this could be found online at a bilingual forum. The rest, you will probably already know by instinct."
2,Misleading title...,"I don't find this book to resemble a practical guide so much as one family's account of their experience. Furthermore, their experience isn't representative enough of typical bilingual families to serve many readers much good. I quickly grew tired of their personal examples and wished for more neutral guidance. As a result, I found myself struggling to bother past the first few chapters and ultimately feel I was mislead by the title and therefore selected the wrong book."
1,Major Disappointment,"I bought this movie because it got such great reviews. What were they thinking?! This movie is terrible. I was expecting a nice heart-warming ""chick-flick."" I was very disappointed. This movie is extremely BORING. It moves so slowly! The whole thing just feels like it's dragging. Boring, boring. I kept hoping it would get better. It never did. Even the ending was lousy. You can tell this was a LOW-BUDGET film. Apparently they couldn't afford to film a wedding scene, or even Bella's funeral! How pathetic. Don't bother watching or buying this. It's a waste of time."
1,Unreadable,"To each his own but I can't understand the glowing reviews for this book. It was awful! I couldn't even make it past the first few chapters. It's tough to criticize a book dealing with child abuse because a) it may be based on someone's actual experiences and b) who am I to talk? I haven't been a victim. However, this is so poorly written that the abuse (at least the initial occurrence - which is all I made it through) just seems ridiculous. It ended up losing the impact it should've had. The way the 10 year old talks and thinks throughout the ordeal doesn't ring true either.This book had the kinds of flaws that a self-published book often has like awkward wording and odd transitions between scenes or events. This book was sorely in need of some editing. And the only reason that it's 500 pages is because of the large print; there's very little text on each page. Believe me, you do not want to spend $22.00 on this!"
5,I have no complaints,Didn't even have to use the cd. This works great and will keep using this product. I had 2 onboard nics fail on me for some reason and had to put this in the computer.
3,Logitech Harmony 1000 Advanced Universal Remote,"I was looking for a remote that could take care of all my home theater system, still been very simple.1st of all, to expensive. Yeah, it looks VERY slick, and people are always amazed by it. Still, overpriced.2nd it doesn't always work. Ex: press turn off, then some devices still stay on, making u go on a mini trouble shooterLiked the product a lot, but the price needs to drop."
1,Looks Good... and Sucks!!!,"Followed all directions.. the damn thing would never function correctly, failed to operate properly after initial charge. Finally, after many hours, Logitech support admitted severe ""firmware"" problems. Supposed to be cured ""soon"".. been saying that for many mnths.. don't count on a quick fix. Too bad, cuz it'd be kewl unit IF it worked as advertised."
1,not worth your time,"horrible item ...never worked correctly...difficult to program..had to keep taking battery out because remote kept freezing up...would not recomend this product...For the price you are paying, should be a better quality item.."
1,Don't Buy Logitech,"I have had several Logitech remotes including 2 Harmony 1000's, Harmony 1 and Harmony 890. Not one of them work properly! The main problem is that you must connect to the web when setting up and changing the components you want controlled. Sounds like a good idea but in reality the software doesn't work and the update just hangs until restarted. It works 10% of the time. You cannot reset the devices to factory default. Not sure why exactly. The concept of being able to automatically set up your remote with an online database of thousands of devices seems appealing but i've wasted countless hours trying to get it to work. Save yourself a headache and do not buy Logitech."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY THIS EXPENSIVE RIPOFF!,"For the love of Pete- don't buy this thing. I don't have time to write all the problems I've had with this $500 doorstop- form touchscreen problems to macro problems to blank boot up screens... Today it finally died after its short, useless existence. I'm not a technophobe. I'm a 3D computer graphics animator and character technical director at a major hollywood animation studio. I worked with this thing- I babied it, learned its likes and dislikes. Whether you're a geek or not- stay away from this remote. It's the floppiest flop that ever flopped into flopdome. In fact I'd stay away from anything Logitech. About the only thing they can do right is mice. Half a grand?! Test your products before you put them on the market guys! You think Apple would release an atrocity like this? Good golly miss Molly! What a piece!"
4,logitech 1000,"great product - was only hard to program because i have dial-up. performs all functions for every component, even the lighting"
3,Harmony 1000 remote,"Logitech Harmony 1000 Advanced Universal RemoteA great remote if you like bells and whistles. However, it doesn't support z-wave technology so if you want to control lights, blinds, or thermostat forget it. Ended up buying the 890Pro which is a much better product for about the same price.Still need to buy the RF extender but you get a lot of options for light control, etc. Also with a software update from BOSE it will control your BOSE system. At last---getting rid of all those remotes!"
4,Logitech Harmony 1000,"What a relief to finally have a product which will control all of my components; the programming can be a little overwhelming when it comes to designating how your components are all hooked up, but once accomplished one touch will turn on your TV, Cable Box, Stereo, DVR, etc. My sole complaint of substance is that the remote sends a more continuous signal than the remote for my Cable Box, so if I want to scroll down the menu one program at a time, often the scroll will continue for 10 or 15 channels. I have to admit that once on, it is easier to use my cable box remote to scroll and select programs. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product."
2,Garbage,I bought this a few years ago and was never impressed with it. The touch screen controls coupled with the RF receiver have a huge delay. Using this remote to channel surf is a waste of time. I occasionally use it to control the music in the house and the RF receiver has pretty good range. Overall though it's garbage.
1,JUNK after one year and no support,"I bought two of these remotes when they first came out. After the first year, problems began and now two years later they are worthless. They no longer intuitively set up the existing or new devices, there are huge delays after depressing selections on the screen, not all toggle keys will work consistently. I can't tell you how many times, I have to turn on or shut my home theater components manually given it's a huge production for this remote to learn/relearn with any consistency to make it a useful remote. I've contacted tech support and now that the warranty is expired after the first 1 year, they won't even discuss the issues. I can't count the amount of times, this unit has failed to perform or the screen froze up on not just one, but BOTH UNITS. I have no kids and the units have not been abused in any way, so this is ridiculous; especially, since I paid over $800 for each!!!!!"
3,Poor opinion until later firmware...,"This was my second Harmony device but first 1000 model. My previous model, an 880, failed to charge after about a year. There are a few pointers to be happy with this new device:1) Get the latest firmwareWithout the update, this device is useless and frustrating since it freezes on a regular basis, necessitating a battery removal and restarts.With the update in place (4.8.X?), the device does what it says on the box - it controls multiple, disparate devices using the same 'activity' concept of the earlier Harmonys. I liked the way the same programming could be transferred between models, saving a large amount of set up time. If you're a newbie to the Harmony range, the set up is a little hokey but ultimately works.If this device were to fail, I would however give up on the Harmony range and move more upscale to something like a Crestron."
4,Finally got rid of my 1/2 dozen remotes,I thought the 1000's shape would be the biggest negative to get over. Instead it's really comfortable and slick looking to boot. The programming went easily (once I figured out not to have the remote and the IR extender plugged into the computer at the same time during updates). Cons: Not having the program residing on the PC and having to update the IR extender every time you update the remote. Two problems that I can overlook when weighing the ease of use. The wife and kids are no longer dependents to the keeper of the six remotes.
4,Good product idiot proof,"Fortunately I purchased this remote after most of the initial issues had been fixed. I did have to return the first one after a month but I have had the second over a year with no issues.For use with a DVR or anything that you need to fast forward rewind or stop, its a must to program the hard buttons left (rewind) and right (fast forward) arrows at the bottom and last channel (stop) once this is complete (and its easy) you will no doubt love this remote. I swear by Harmony remotes you can get the same functionality with one of the other Harmony products for less money."
5,This book brings back knowledge quickly. Be the GeeK...,Fantastic book. Keep it in easy reach. Quickly refresh your mind on information you have forgotten. Definitly makes you the knowledge base of the tech room.
5,The Perfect Watch,"I have been a fan of this little wristwatch for a long time. It's small; you don't have to take it off when doing the dishes, or anything else that involves water; and, I like the timer function on it. Plus it lasts a long time - it's pretty rugged."
2,Made for a child.,"This is a cute watch, but it is so small. It works for my 4 year old but not for me."
1,Impossible to set,"My doctor wanted me to do a simple exercise every hour on the hour, so I purchased this watch because it has an alarm, that's all. I can't even set the current time! I'm not returning it because it would cost more to ship than it's worth. I've learned to read the comments posted on Amazon (my all time favorite site) and think I have found a good alarm watch. So, I'll give this to some unsuspecting teenager or young child and I'm sure they will love it."
4,Best Little Watch,"As a young adult, I have a rather active lifestyle - going places, doing things, appointments to remember - and this cute little watch has come along for the ride without any major problems. I've swum in the ocean with it, sweated in the tropics with it, banged it on concrete, left it in serious heat... As a side note, the little fish accent at the end of the strap is an adorable touch to the watch!I bought the little guy at Kmart, but recently returned to buy a second one when the straps broke only to find that the store no longer carries this classic little casio.I only have two qualms about recommending it: 1) the straps seem to go brittle in about two years of heavy use [and I've replaced the battery once] and 2)there is no illumination/glow-in-the-dark option for it, which makes it slightly less useful for darker settings like unlit rooms or camping tents."
5,I've been wearing this model watch for years!,"I couldn't find it in the store so I checked online and FOUND IT!!I have an allergy to metal. This watch's band and all of the buckle are plastic. It works great, is water resistant and great extras! I'll keep buying this watch."
4,Over 40,Casio products have always been very dependable. The only problem with this one is if you are over 40. The numbers for the alarm on the face of the watch are so small that I needed a magnifying glass to see them.
3,Buttons are hard to push on my new watch,"I ordered a watch to replace an old one that is giving me problems. While the watch is identical, the buttons on the new watch are all pretty stiff to push.I put on a metal expansion band since I plan on having this watch for a number of years. The 3 stars are because of the stiff buttons. Once the watch is set, I will not need to be pushing buttons that often."
5,Repeat customer,I have purchased this particular watch multiple times over the past fifteen years or so. It is durable and very easy to use/program. I particularly enjoy the quick button timer alarm feature. The only thing it is lacking is a light feature. It is very reasonably priced.
2,Mickey Mouse,"I was so disappointed in this watch. It was very small. It did not keep accurate time. It did not have a light where you can read it in the dark. I finally, happily, gave it away. It was a joke. I went to K-Mart and got me a real watch."
4,Remo Williams..........the Destroyer on the silver screen,"I originally saw this at the theater when it opened. I was a fond reader of 'The Destroyer' books by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir. I thought the cast was excellent as well as the acting and action. Fred Ward was a great choice as Remo as well as Joel Grey as Chiun, master of Sinanju. Unfortunately for me, this movie didn't spawn any sequels........yet! Hopefully there are others in hollywood that would like to make some Destroyer movies. It would be nice if the DVD had more to offer like bloopers, deleted scenes, commentaries or even an interview with Murphy and Sapir. This is why I'm only giving the dvd 4 out of 5 stars. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites because I liked the books. If you didn't read the books, you probably won't know what is going on."
5,Remo re-release,"I can't tell you how excited I am about the re-release of Remo Williams: the Adventure begins. I saw this movie for the first time last year and it has become a cult classic with my co-workers and I. The way this movie is put together is very strange. It's labeled as an Action/Adventure Movie but has many very funny parts that make you wonder if it's a comedy. my favorite part is when diamond tooth pays three construction workers thirty dollars to split between them for killing Remo. when diamond-tooth is convinced that Remo is dead he pays the workers in all one-dollar bills. Makes you wonder if he was paying them thirty thousand. that notion is dismissed when you hear one of the workers say: ""It's Miller time boys!"" over all I think this movie is a must see for cult movie lovers and I give it 5 stars! I have my order ready for 5-22, I hope you do too."
5,This movie is great fun,"I looked for this DVD several years ago and it wasn't available. Now it is. I loved this movie when I first saw it I ran out and bought and read about a hundred Destroyer books. The movie was made from that book series. As with most book series, the quality dropped some after the first two or three dozen. The best books were about the relationship between the two main characters. That's what this movie is about. It's a great adventure with great tricks but it's all about the characters. I am disappointed that no more movies were made. The books supplied a lot of material. I have only watched a few movies more than twice: this is one of them!"
5,Wonderful Cult classic,"This is a great movie to relax with on a lazy day, and I can't believe they haven't released it on DVD. This movie should be seen in widescreen (OK every movie should be seen in widescreen), and just begs for a blooper reel. It is a fun romp with characters who because of their faults are more believable. I can really enjoy a movie where the actors apear to be having fun! It has never really been taken seriously (probably why it isn't on DVD yet). There is a place for serious movies on my shelf, but after a hard day of working, I say dim the lights and pass the cheese please!!!"
4,Remo Williams - The Adventure DELIVERS,"For a movie that was made over 20 years ago, Remo still entertains. You'll remember Chun and Remo, and the classic running on quick-sand, dodging bullets, and balancing on anything - but you'll have forgotten the great look at 'advanced technology' such as the top secret 'interweb' used to find information from around the world - all based on a desktop computer and attached to a library full of ten foot servers. I have had to watch this movie several times since I purchased it - at a great price - because anyone that grew up in the eighties remembers it and likes to be entertained by this light hearted action comedy."
3,Casting and Destroyer Books Better than Movie,"The first 2/3 of the film are quite good. The unfortunately it is just like any other by the numbers action film. That's truly a pity because you have great characters, a wonderful series of books that the movie is based on and a great cast with Fred Wardmaking a surprisingly excellent Remo and Joel Grey despite it not being political correct perfect as Chiun. The set piece at the Statue of Liberty is pretty interesting but unfortunately Jackie Chan has done this sort of thing much better. When we get to the standard explosions and such you long for the wit and wisdom of the books and the characters. Missed opportunity. Hopefully they will try again... hey, put Jackie Chan in old age make as CHIUN and get Jason Statham from The TRANSPORTER as REMO..."
3,I was hoping for more eastern ID WA routes.,"It's well enough written with nice information for routes included. But more coastal routes than I'd prefer living in MT and meeting ID friends once or so a year for rides. However I thought it better than Eastern WA Rides as many seemed to be connected with towns than country. Hope to put it to more use than right now I can see however I can see that it would be right for others living in the area of the trails described.I recommend the rail road conversion to bike trails as a better source for the kind of rides we were looking for. The one that covers WA, ID and OR too."
3,Super toy for 3 & 4 Year Old Grandkids!,"Minutes after the parcel arrived our grandaughters were ready to play with the new addition to their Dora Doll House. They figured out on their own how to connect the pool to the doll house. Its a great feature that the ""add-ons"" include a Dora doll, that way more than one child can play with the doll house."
1,Hoodwinked: a mirrored look at the conservative right,"This isn't a novel or research; it's propaganda for the tenacious conservative right that continues to peddle half truths skillfully written to ensure being Hoodwinked. This is cherry picking at it's best and in normal conservative fashion an issue is plucked clean of any useful material with the rest of the 'picture' out of view. This book serves one purpose: to blind those seeking the entire argument of an issue and the promotion of old school thinking of the conservative dogma. No wonder free thinking scares conservatives; once you get the ball rolling, their house of cards will come crumbling down."
3,Disappointed,"As someone who has read almost every one of Richard Laymon's books, I was sadly dissapointed in ""Funland"". It is not nearly as violent or realistic as most of his other books. The premise of the book was a good idea but he failed to deliver the usual ""chills and thrills"" so to speak. I was dissapointed with this book."
4,SURPRISING!,"This book is different from most, and that is welcome. The characters are realistic, and you care about them.The story really changes in the last part, unpredictably."
5,TERRIFIC! COULDNT PUT THE BOOK DOWN!,"Terrific book. It was scary,exciting,myserious with a touch of romance. Totally recomend this book. READ IT!"
4,"A few things you should know about Arkangel's 'Henry IV, Part Two'","As with the first part of 'Henry IV' Arkangel does an excellent job in portraying the different levels of 15th century society. While Part Two is generally not as dramatically coherent as Part One, this particular production is handled as well as the first one. Geoffrey Bayldon is delightful as justice Shallow, while Pistol (""the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England"") is played by Edward de Souza as a bulging-eyed, spluttering madman, who rolls his 'r's like a highland Scot. Evie Mathieson brings a seductive sleaziness to the part of Doll Tearsheet, giving hilarious weight to the prince's line about ""Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction."""
2,Poor performances,"I do not recommend this album. Basch's playing is pinched, inexpressive, and inarticulate. His Hummel recording is scratchy and drained of glory. His playing in the Hertel pieces sounds like that of an oboe, but without any richness of tone."
5,Good watch for the money.,"I just got my second one of this watch after 4 years. First one the battery died, I replaced the battery but the watch was dead. I was suprised it lasted that long so I didn't complain about buying another one for 20 bucks. After the abuse the first one took in that time with working out at the gym, soaked with water, being hit off other objects, and getting ripped off my wrist numerous times, I had no issues about buying another one of the same model. This is a good value in a watch that will do the job."
3,Too small to be true,"Honestly, when seeing this watch in the images I thought it would be a real sport watch. The one to inspire trust and resistance. Unfortunately it looks like a toy and I fear it works like one, too. It's cute, small, almost like a dame watch, and it feels like you don't have anything on your wrist. So, if that's what you search for, go ahead. Anyway, the price is almost ridiculous, so expect just what you pay for."
5,A totally wonderful and insightful book,"The author spends six years travelling around the planet, and on his journeys he discovers many fundamental aspects of human nature. As the picture emerges, Brugiroux also finds his own place in the world, and offers real hope for all those searching for the truth."
5,A good read.,"This book will only appeal to mariners, as it deals with one of the classic disasters with rescue of passengers.Human error and not familiar with the use of radar led to this disaster. There are many more articles on this subject, the author does a good job here."
1,Not real silver,"When this ring tarnished and I attempted to clean it in the proper recommend way, it turned black which means it is not sterling silver. I do not recommend anyone buying it. Now I'm stuck with an cheap ugly black piece of metal."
2,Not as good as pictured,"This is not as pretty as it is pictured. The wire is kind of haphazardly melded together. It does fit well, though. I am a tad disappointed with the quality. The item did arrive quickly and in good condition (if a little ugly to begin with), though.If you are thinking of buying this or another item...consider the other item."
4,Fun and unique,I saw this product on-line and purchased it. It looks the same on-line as it does in person and I have gotten much use out of it already. I have also gotten compliments on it. It goes with anything and is fun and unique to wear. I can tell where it was cut and melted back together though when I chose my ring size (which is fairly small) but I don't think it is that noticeable to anyone else as I wear that part to show on the under side of my finger. I plan to continue to get lots of use out of it and the only thing I would recommend is to take off the ring before applying lotion - it does get stuck in the wiring otherwise and makes it hard to get out!
5,Pretty and Unique Ring,"This ring is lovely and unique (just as the title says). I like that it has a handcrafted look. Even though it is not one of a kind, it has that sort of appeal. I regret listening to the reviewer that said the ring runs small. I ordered up one size larger than I normally wear, and it was way too big. Wide band rings do fit tighter, but if you already know what size you wear in a wide band ring, do not buy up in size."
4,Perfect and exactly what I was looking for,"I wanted a ring that stood out yet was not too flashy. This is perfect. The unusual shape makes it an eye catching item, yet its neither bulky nor overwhelming. I love it. Two caution.... it doesn't exactly look like the picture. I just happen to really like anyways. Second it often gets caught in my hair or clothing. so watch out.I would recommend it and would buy it again."
1,very poor,"I got this ring and I got shocked because the real thing is discusting! It is crooked, very ugly and very bad in quality. I won't have it for free if someone gives it to me! What a waste of money."
4,Delicate,"I like it alot, but not for everyday wear, the silver is soft and will bend if caught on something, but for the price, nice addition to jewelry collection."
3,"Beautiful, sizing is off","I took the advice of the other reviews and went up a size, but mine was still a little tight. I am still waiting for my exchange but I hope it comes soon, I loved the ring.The ring is beautiful and I got so many compliments on it."
1,One of the worst animes around,"This is one of the worst animes to plague the anime market.This movie was so bad that I just could'nt keep focused on it...I finally stopped watching it after 10 annoying minutes of this irritating film.If you want good anime go with good,quality anime like ""Gundam Wing"",""Pokemon"" or ""Galaxy Express 999""."
2,JACK NICHOLSON BIOGRAPHY,This was nothing near being a biography. It was just a book full of episodes in Jack N's life that were taken from various magazine/newspaper/media articles - things everyone already knew about him - nothing new or personal things about him - usually what a biography exposes. I found it very ho-hum.
3,Registered Means Immortality.,"Poor Kem is at it again! He has pulled a lot of pranks involving the media (using them to promote silliness) such as selling his soul on eBay; he writes that he got enough to buy a car. Maybe I'll try that. I'm pretty tired of riding worn-out buses driven by idiots.Media pranks involve cooking up a story as an event in order to make a larger, satirical point. And he has become the master of this fraud.This book isn't about freedom of expression as I know it. He is a journalist from Iowa and eveybody knows that is a backward state. On the certificate from the government he has moved to Massachuetts. I express myself as I please, not as a prank to get publicity.His latest prank was to obtain a U. S. Tradmark #2,127,381 on that phrase, which was signed by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. This book would not been officially classified as non-fiction without the photo of the certificate as a preface. He has pulled the ultimate prank."
3,black booty,"I always wanted to visit Jamaica, but after watching the 59-minute travelogue, ""Caribbean Booty Call"", now I don't think I'm going. I've been there. ""Booty Call"" is a leisurely stroll through this tiny island, hosted by three young, dark, black girls in bikinis. They're not beautiful, but they are sexy. They splash in streams and walk along the pebbled-beach. Windy, lonely beaches, deserted shanties, old bridges, locals in a parade, and a sign for Kingston Harbor. The girls walk up to a road from the beach, passing a middle-aged woman carrying a basket on her head. She stops, turns, and looks back at the girls. She is what they will look like in a few years. At the end, each young babe slowly strips down to nothing. The black beauty at the end is worth the whole DVD. Like I said, I'm not going to visit Jamaica anytime soon. Then again, there is next summer...."
3,GINA GERSHON SIZZLEZ AS HEAT !!!!!!!,SAW THIS MOVIE 10 YEARZ AGO ....BEEN A FAN OF GINA'S EVA SINCE ....GINA IN THE BED .... GINA IN THE KITCHEN ....GINA IN THE GARDEN ....WHAT A PLOT !!!
2,Boring,"This is one of those talkie movies that can either be very engaging or extremely dull. Love Matters falls into the latter category. Not even the promise of hot sex spices up this bomb.A man reluctantly allows his friend to come over to his house with his mistress (a pre-Showgirls Gina Gershon). The first man's wife (Annette O'Toole) is unhappy with her husband for endorsing his friend's adultery. They have their own marital troubles, sex being a big factor.I saw the unrated version and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why it was unrated. There is more nudity and sex in a lot of R-rated movies. And like Homer Simpson said when told of a beautiful woman, is she beautiful or is she Gina Gershon-beautiful? Figure that out for yourself."
2,Disappointing with scant new information,"Woodworth is a proven, able civil war historian, but this is one of his weakest books. Instead of concentrating on Grant's relationship with his subordinates, he focuses on mini biographhies of people in Grant's orbit, such as Wallace, Baldy Smith, Sherman and Sheridan. The biographies themselves are no better than what you would find in an encyclopedia and contain absolutely no new or novel information. There is very little material on the personal dynamics between the commander and his minions.Grant's famous feuds with Rosecrans, Pap Thomas and Smith are poorly presented and glossed over without inciteful comment. A golden opportunity is missed here, because these disagreements highlight the most interesting aspect of Grant's relationships throughout the war. In short, a slim and completely unpenetrating look at a subject that is well suited for a lengthy and interesting examination."
3,Nice cables--postage was $87.00,"I ordered 35 Ethernet, 25' cables. They were reasonably priced, however, the postage was $87.00. Unbelieveable!!"
1,Ether net cable,The wire I got was bad and did not work. the price was good but unfortunately I had to throw it away .
1,horrible,"i was reading this book expecting an EPIC ending, and for about 3/4 of the book it seemed as though i would get that. then things sort of came to a dead end after they figured out how to kill off the worms. after that it was all downhill from there. the ending was literally rushed. no detail whatsoever and i was extremely disappointed. it was the weakest ending i have ever read to what seemed like a great series. do urself a favor, dont waste a single penny on this last book.just know that the worms die.the end."
1,Rapidly Discharges,"I rarely give negative reviews on products I have purchased. But this is one of those occasions when it's appropriate. The battery fits my Panasonic PV-GS29 just fine. But when I first got this battery, it didn't accept a full charge. After using it a few times and recharging, it began to show a full charge on the meter of the camera. However it discharges rapidly and requires much more frequent charging than the original battery that came with the camcorder. I read on a few blog sites that occasionally a new Li-ion battery will give a false reading on the device's meter of being discharged. To correct this you are supposed to totally discharge the battery ONLY ONCE. Then make sure you recharge immediately to 100%. I tried this last night and the battery still does not retain a full charge even overnight. I have a Lenmar battery as well, that works as it should. I think I'll bite the bullet and spend the extra money on a Lenmar instead."
3,Not a Good Effort,"This 35 minute maxi EP is a very mixed bag. I am a big fan of their work on Apartment Life and Long Distance and this CD was a real disappointment.Here there is little effort made to really make the songs their own. Sure there is some cutesiness added to most, but this is hardly palatable much less appreciated. Be My Baby is given an interesting twist, which is probably appropriate given Durand's pregnancy, but many of the songs simply remind you how much better the original song is which is not the impression you want to create on a cover album.You really have to wonder why Ivy put out this CD. There are no new musical horizons covered here and Steve, and the rest of the band, seems to be bored while supporting Durand's vocals. Maybe a cash flow crisis? Speaking of cash flow, anyone want to buy my copy? If you are new to Ivy, buy Long Distance instead."
1,PROTECTION!!!!!!,"Just like ""wiseconsumers"" experience, we had our camcorder for about 3 months when ""PROTECTION!"" started flashing across the screen. The first thing I did was check the cassette to be sure that the protection switch wasn't flipped and it was not. Then I checked every option under ""menu"" to see if there was some setting. Still thinking it was just human error, I started to check the manual and the web for anything I could find. Well, I found that I wasn't the only one who had a mysterious case of the ""PROTECTIONS!"" I haven't called samsung yet, it's too late tonight but after reading ""wiseconsumers"" post, I'm ready for a dogfight. At least he didn't have to pay for his . . . ."
4,saw blades,"This was one of the few places that I found to purchase a 41/4"" blade.Service was prompt."
3,not that clear,"I've practiced CMC's short form for a few years before I read this book. The bulk of the book is form sequence pictures, but as another reviewer wrote, these are mirror-image pictures and I found them awkward to use as well. Another book, ""The Tai Chi Book : Refining and Enjoying a Lifetime of Practice"" by Robert Chuckrow, explains the tai ji concepts clearer and the form sequence pictures are not mirrored, even though he's writing about the same thing and the same 37 posture form. Learning the flow of the form from any sequence of pictures is difficult because it's hard to capture the flow between them, but the mirrored pictures in this makes it harder to compare body positions."
4,Good,"This book has basically everything for a full-year course, and it is explained pretty clearly. LOTS of solutions to problems are in the back, which was very helpful. The problems I had with the book include that many things took more space and time than needed and many times better examples could have been used, but if you don't mind reading a lot, this is a pretty good book."
4,Its nice :),"I tried this product because I fell in love with the VO5 Strawberries and Cream conditioner and wanted to see if I would fall in love with this one. Its pretty good, it didn't give my hair as much slip as I wanted to though. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a conditioner for co-washing."
1,"You're kidding, right?","This CD is great...if you like the who William Hung, American Idol thing.Only difference between this guy and William Hung is there are more songs on Hung's CD."
5,I would love to fly with you!!!,"This is a dynamite duo: cd/dvd!!! I first heard Michael Buble music in the Spring of 2005. The first purchase was It's Time, which is mind-blowing good!!! Come fly with me is awesome! The music is out of this world, and in my opinion, he sounds better than the original singers in the remakes he sings. WOW!!! The DVD is great! It shows his sense of humor, as well as his sensitive side. And there is no denying that he is an absolutely talented and amazing singer! The band is second to none as well! My impression of his talent was cemented even further when I saw his Concert in Spokane, WA in July of 2006. He never missed a beat and his voice was perfectly in tune. I have shared my excitement about his music and how it has touched my life with all of my friends, and have converted many of them to also be faithful fans of Michael's music. I now own almost all of his CD's and cannot wait to get the next one!"
3,"Buy the CD, wait for a better DVD!!","I bought this DVD after the last CD, which I LOVE and haven't stopped listening to since I got it, which is why I was all the more dissappointed by the horrible production in the DVD. The ""live"" video parts are just a horrible mesh of fade-in, fade-outs, b&w;, cut to another take... enough to give you motion sickness! (and I love mtv, so its not that). the music is fantastic, but i would advice to buy a cd instead and wait for a better dvd to come out. he does come through as a pretty nice guy in the short inverview bits, but even those are with a camera thats jumping every which way in a moving car (thank god for traffic lights, at least when the car stops the camera stays still). advice to michael: stay AWAY from whoever edited this horrible thing.the live cd it comes with is not bad, though..."
5,Fascinating film about teens,If you grew up in LA or the San Fernando valley then this is something you won't want to miss. The film is about teens in their senior year in the San Fernando valley who don't understand adults or themselves really. They want to be grown up but they have no idea how to get there.Jodie Foster and Cherie Curry from The Runaways do an excellent job here as does everyone else. Cherie Curry probably didn't have to stretch much to play her character Annie and Jodie Foster as always does a great job with her character too.The film isn't polished. Nor is the acting. And it shouldn't be. Some people dismiss the film as inept and low budget. The film would not work if it were high budget and polished with perfect acting by everyone. The acting is natural and that is why this film works.You won't forget it after seeing it.
1,Puberty Was Nirvana Compared To This Movie,"There's nothing more annoying than a teen movie that gets it all wrong. I was seventeen when this flick came out and had teenage sisters at the time. These aren't teenagers but adults mouthing what some studio hack thinks is teenspeak. Calling John Hughes!!! What's even more annoying is they get the music wrong. Angel!!! What did they do hold cattle call for every mediocre hair-metal band signed to Casablanca records? ""On the Radio"" as an anthem for a generation? In my school it was ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""Freebird"". Joan Jett should have kicked Cherie Currie's behind for being associated with this dreck. Jodie Foster isn't annoying here just wooden. Disney put better use to her acting chops. Pretty pathetic when the most appealing character is the one played by Scott ""Chachi"" Baio. Makes me long for ""Little Darlings""."
4,This movie is great!,"This movie needs to be on DVD. It is essential and underappreciated. I saw it when it first came out when I was in 8th grade and never forgot it. It is a late 70's/early 80's decadent SoCal teen slice of life. They even throw in Scott Baio in Adidas shorts on a skateboard for versimilitude. Jodie Foster is awesome, Sally Kellerman is neurotic and self-centered, Cherie Curie is unforgettable. That party scene-I dug it when I was a kid but today it's every adults nightmare. The soundtrack is perfect--only thing missing is some Cheap Trick!"
5,great activity toy,"This simple, inexpensive toy has engaged both my 1 year old and my 2 year old. They both enjoy nesting as well as stacking the blocks. The movable pieces inside the blocks also capture their interest. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,Good quality,The tablecloth repelled a spill really well. It would be perfect if it was wrinkle free. Overall good quality for the money.
4,"fine scratches, yes. anything worse, good luck.","I've been able to fix fine scratches off cds and dvds, but not always. The cleaning solution and cloth are quite good. Bear in mind that nothing will fix deep scratches, it doesn't matter how much it costs."
3,Ouija is for real!,"I just want to affirm that like the book says, the Ouija board is a very powerful occultic device. I've seen it's power first hand, and have talked to a few others that have had even wilder experiences than I have with the Ouija board. As a Christian I firmly believe in demons, and the Ouija board is one great way to see their power. Will everyone witness demonic power with the Ouija? No. The demonic realm doesn't work like that, the devil is much more crafty than to show himself to loser skeptics such as many of those that have written posts here. Those same skeptics will also be in for a terrible shock when they meet God on Judgment day. Oh well, I'm sure they were warned."
3,Not worth it...,"Maybe it was becuase of the hype (most P.J. Harvey fans would probably consider this album her ""best""), maybe it was because I was blown away by ""Stories from the City"", but for whatever reason, ""Dry"" did absolutely nothing for me. Some of the songs are good, if only for P.J's candor about sexuality. (O Stella, Happy and Bleeding, etc.) Fair warning to those expecting more catchy, radio-friendly melodies like those from ""Stories"" should be warned because this album simply doesn't have them, with the notable exception of Sheela-Na-Gig. The 3 stars were given because 1)its P.J. Harvey and 2)some of the lyrics and again with the honesty. Overall, I would say download a few of the songs first to see if this is your cup of tea. Needless to say it wasn't mine. After having the album for a week I sold it."
1,Absolute garbage,Just watched part of this on comedy central and would liken it to watching a train wreck. So horrible sometimes its tough to look away. It seems as if they are actually making up the script as they go along.
3,ok,This movie was not very good. I only watched it because I was bored and there where no other movies I really wanted to see. This movie is prabally good for a rainy day.
4,Great Football Flick,"It's a great football story with an excellent ending.Johnny Walker is a sought after Senior Quarterback who has College Universities looking to sign him to a commitment under ""any means necessary"", and that means breaking all the rules.Meanwhile Uma Thurman plays his girlfriend who helps Johnny reach for the stars, but keep his feet firmly on the ground.The ending has a wonderful message too."
3,Straighten out these comments please,"Giving this film a neutral star rating so its rating isn't unduly altered. I've seen this film; like any political documentary, there's a degree of Kool-Aide drinking that has to occur before everything goes down unopposed. I personally enjoyed it very much, but you have to maintain a healthy bit of suspicion when you view something as politically charged as ""Bush's Brain"".Which is why reading the reviews here is so distrubing. I should be able to find one- and two-star ratings with enlightened Bush-friendly commentary as to why this film is bogus, right? In the service of keeping an open mind?So here's my request. If you're going to give this film a one- or two-star rating that derides it, or that explicitly supports Bush, or that personally attacks the film's producers or the book's authors, would you please:1. Gather some facts2. Form an idea that you can establish in writing3. Make sure you've actually seen the filmK? Thanks."
4,"""Let's Eat Jack for Supper""","Jack's always gittin' into some find of fixin' and always gittin' outa it. He's a hillbilly that's not too bright; 'cept he always manages to outsmart his troubles. Like the time the four-headed giant and his mom want to eat little bitty Jack for supper after he had killed her three sons (each with several heads) which were about six times the size of a natural person. Look-a-here, you might say, how can uh ordinary boy whup so many giants? Well'm, he can't. (Ain't ye got no sense?) He outsmarts 'em. And it's a real howdy do!The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
1,Ponderous and Enigmatic,"First off, don't think for a minute that I don't ""get it"". I do. I have been watching SF, reading SF for over 30 years, and I am just as thrilled to watch a brilliant piece of SF filmmaking - regardless of the public response or the inaccessability of the theme - as I am to view any great work of art.This version of SOLARIS, sadly, leaves more to be desired than it delivers. The writing is intentionally enigmatic, and one gets the sense that the filmmaker doesn't really know what's going on, so he's hiding his cluelessness behind a thin veneer of ""cleverness"".It doesn't work.There is nothing in the film I would call brilliant. The acting is so-so (having the lead walking around looking at things to creepy music for an hour is pretty lame), the photography is average, and the script doesn't do justice to the original material.I expect great art to leave me a better person - I can get lost in a masterpiece for hours. This film left me thinking I had wasted my hours."
1,a slow annihilation,"Like Terence Malick's 2011 horror The Tree of Life, Solaris pretends at philosophy. Even in the USSR its reception was only credible because of the director's nationality. Russian literature and philosophy are broad and deep, from early mysticisms to modern realism. And poetry, in that the Russians excel. But Tarkovsky's admittedly beautiful photograpic essay is little more than pseudo-philosophy and poor surrealistic art."
3,Solid Guitar Player,People throw five stars with ease on these reviews. I think five should be reserved for exceptional releases. I'll give this a 3+. This has some good blues tracks mixed in with some Rock-n-Roll. Worth the money.
1,Buy a magnifying glass as well,I was really excited to get this game. I popped it in and was disappointed from the start. Do you see how small the people are? It should be called Grand Theft Ants. Good graphics but the people are small and very hard to see. Not worth anything.
3,height fit,does anyone know if the bike would fit for 5'6 guys? i am 5'6 but don't know if it would fit for 5'6 guy
3,it will get you there.,"I bought this bike a couple months ago and just completed a two day 150 mile ride and can say they bike held up fine. Overall the bike was fine during the training and the event. I had to make some adjustments, replace some tubes and I replaced the pedals with pedals that had straps and I and the bike made it."
2,no manual or instructions,"This bike came partially assembled, however they did not even bother to include assembly instructions. The manual in the box is for the gears and other stuff. Very disappointed."
2,stay away,"Yes the pricing on this bike for an entry level road bike looks tempting, but honestly you get what you pay for. The bike looks all shiny with stickers and such but after months on the bike it starts to fall apart HARD. as the other reviewers have mentioned brakes on this bike is terrible, but thats the least of your worries. i think the biggest problem on this bike is just poor build quality. everything will eventually break whether it be your seat, handlebars, or the craptastic gear system. also the rims on this bicycles are perfectly designed to puncture your inner tube so get ready to patch and replace the inner tubing often. To sum things up, beautiful bike terrible quality. stay far and clear."
4,Pretty nice for a cheap bike,"I received my bike and set about assembling it. The first thing I noticed was that one spoke on the front wheel had gotten bent in transit. The bike assembles very easily with 1 size wrench and 2 sizes of Allen key.I have many of the same complaints as the other reviewers:-Derailleurs are off a little bit-Front brake needs some serious adjustment-Plastic shield on the crank gear is in the way-Seat does not adjust forward or back(though I didn't feel the need to tilt it while test riding it)-Braking position is awkwardThe above having been said, what do you expect out of a bike that costs anywhere between $90 and $145? This is your standard, run of the mill asian import bike. It needs adjusting, correcting and sometimes, the parts need replacing to work right.That is just what I expected when I made this purchase, and so far I'm satisfied."
4,Survived brick roads... so far,"Got the X-Large (25"") size of this bike and like it so far. Standover height is good for 6'3+. You get what you pay for, so don't expect a lightweight superfast bike. However, for $160, you won't find another road bike with this size frame.Calipers are horrible. Upgrade immediately to something better. I got Tektro R536 Caliper - Front, Standard Nut and Tektro R536 Caliper - Rear, Standard Nut for $52. Braking power is much better now and I feel safe commuting with this bike. The stock calipers are horrible.There are no quick releases on this bike. EVERYTHING is bolted.The handlebar tape is starting to loosen so I will have to fix that soon.As other reviews point out, this is a good bike if you are willing to take the time and money for some upgrades. If you want a great bike already setup correctly then you might want to go to a local bike shop (and spend some big cash money). Overall I don't regret the purchase."
5,Very good entry level bike,It is a very good entry level bike. For the price of under $150 one could not get anything better.
1,Bad,"Not a good bicycle, makes a lot of noise. U can see and feel the joint of wheel which is not good for breaking."
4,Good bike BUT....terrible customer service,"Received this bike in early September, arrived partly damaged with the shipment: the front wheel was bent. Also, I assembled it but it needed professional help with brakes and gears. I immediately called KENT and they suggested I return the bike to Amazon. I told them I wanted to keep the bike and get a front wheel replacement. They placed my order but said they were OUT OF STOCK and I should call back in 2 months to check on the order status. I called after 2 months and their response was: ""We are still out of stock, it will be another 2-6 weeks"" -I took my bike to a repair shop and it costed me 25bucks to repair the wheel, adjust the brakes and gears.That is why I give 4 stars."
3,GMC Denali - A good start to bike,"Good looks and durability are the things that I got for the amount I paid for this bike. This bike is worth the money that I paid for. The gears and the seats are not of the top quality. It does work but it's not so good. The breaks totally sucks. But it's a good ride and perfect bike to begin with. I am enjoying my time with it. If the gears and breaks had been perfect, I would have given a 4/5 for this bike.Product link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GNWPK2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Back wheel came warped out of the box!,"I can't believe it! I spent hours unpacking and assembling this bike only to discover the back wheel is totally warped! Now I have unassembled it and stuff everything in the box to return. UPS is suppose to pick it up tomorrow but I don't have time to wait around. If I knew I was going to have these problems I would never have ordered it. My advice, buy a bike locally unless you have nothing but time to mess around with receiving and returning faulty merchandise."
1,P.O.S.,"This bicycle is inexpensive, but it rides like it. It also looks cool, but that's it. The gear-shifting system is horrible and outdated. It makes a grinding, metal-on-metal sound while riding in the lower gears. Does it look cool? Yes. Does it need major work after market purchase? Yes. I should have paid the extra $100 to get a different bike, because now I'm stuck with a $159 P.O.S. I was trying to save money, and at the same time look good, but it only half worked."
1,GMC Denali Road Bike,The bike came (of course to mount) BUT with a missing piece and I had to go buy it!Don't buy this bike online
5,Great Bike for the money,"The bike itself is a great deal for the money. I use it as a recreational bike. I go to the gym about 4 days a week, but I'm not into the cardio workouts. So I use the bike for that. I love the bike it's nice and solid. The only problems I've had is I would tell people to invest in a set of good tubes. I had to replace both of them. The front one the rim had a burr where the valve stem is. Other than that no complaints. Amazon had the bike on my porch in 2 days!"
4,Awesome Road Bike,LOve the bike to death! Its perfect for me because since its a road bike its fast and gets me school fast!
3,workmanship,Nice bike looks great but not the best workmanship when it arrived it had a bent rear rim but for the price it is a good entry level bike
1,Defective piece,"So my bike was defective. The wire connecting the handlebar with the front brake was too short which prevented the front wheel from turning left. A week of wrestling with it, I managed to break the screw in half and called amazon. So I give a 1 star to the product. The manual does not apply to the model being sold.Amazon customer service deserves a 5 star though. They are sending me a replacement bike, so lets see how this goes."
1,"Very, very, fake!","If I hadn't wasted my money on this stupid movie I would have been happy but you know what this movie wasn't exciting at all. Poor, Harrison Ford had to act for the main character in this movie. The rest of his movies are great but this one is definetly not good! This movie is about a couple of terriosts who hijack a plane and try to kill a president, see it's a stupid movie. The Die Hard movies are the best! This movie is just plain dumb."
2,No title,"As the great Russian poet Lermontov once said: ""All this would be very funny if it was not so sad."""
4,My Husband loves this movie!,This is a good movie and will keep you watching all the way through. Harrison Ford is excellent in this and the supporting cast is good as well. The plot is revelent with all the current world situations. The ending makes you want to cheer!
3,Once upon a time....,"... USA was the only country in the world where this kind of story (although farfetched) could be happening. Especially when you remember the JFK's fighting history (maybe it's one of the reasons why he was assassinated). But now, when you see the Bush family history, the only war record of the grandfather (at the same time JFK was patrolling in the Pacific) shows his best achievement was building the family's fortune by catering for the Third Reich's financial needs. And I can imagine the present Bush pounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the head with a bible (to show him it's better than the coran), and telling him ""Get out of my world"". As well, USA lost all credibility when he got RE-elected : One mistake might be understandable, but, as the Romans said ""Errare humanum est, sed perseverare diabolicum"" (to err is human, but to persist is diabolical)."
3,Typical Harrison Ford Movie,"Before I'd seen this movie, I posited that Ford's character would get dragged behind the airplane, since after all, his characters always get dragged behind something. It's his trademark. Imagine my surprise when it happens twice (although the first time isn't up to Ford's usual ""getting dragged"" scenes).Beyond that, the plot was unbelievable, the technical details inaccurate, the characters were two dimensional, and the dialog didn't work. Fortunately, it had a bunch of really swell action scenes, as well as Gary Oldman to make it interesting. And, there's always Harrison Ford to look at.Probably worth a rental, and definitely good if you're not in the mood for thinking or realism. It also seems to be a favorite for demoing home theater systems, which gives it some value. END"
3,Great Cast -- Stupid Movie,"If it weren't for Ford and Olman doing their best to keep this turkey of a film together, it wouldn't be worth sitting through more than five minutes of it."
5,Air Force One,"The President of the United States, James Marshall, takes a tough anti-terrorist stance and then becomes a hostage himself when Air Force One is taken over by terrorists from Kazakhstan, led by Ivan Korshunov, who demand the release of their fascistic leader General Radek. The President seems to escape from the plane in an emergency capsule yet is actually hiding on board. He silently kills a member of the terrorist group before establishing contact with F-15's to engage the hijacked plane. As passengers escape by parachute, Marshall is captured by Ivan and forced to release General Radek, setting in motion an international incident. This movie thrills you constantly. Tightly constructed and with precious little humor."
4,Effective Action Flick!,Harrison Ford continues his top billing streak with this exciting film about terrorists hijacking the President's plane. He proves his star power in the title role. Gary Oldman is errie as the leader of the rag-tag group of thugs. He is one of the best villans in Hollywood today. Check it out!
3,"Is it a bird, is it a plane? no it's THE PRESIDENT ?","This film is so over the top it's hilarious, this is POTUS as super hero, you almost wonder why he needs the plane I'm assuming the only reason he didn't reveal his true identity of US PRESIDENT MAN the masked avenger is that he couldn't find a convenient phone booth to change into his star spangled leotard. I enjoyed the film, but I feel a little dash of realism would have made it much better, just a bit believable maybe."
4,Good action,"The real reason to watch this film is the chameleonic talents of Gary Oldman. Special effects are dated, but still worth a watch."
5,"""MY FAMILY GOES FIRST!""",Edge-Of-Your-Seat excitement! Top-notch special effects! A-level acting! Riveting storytelling! Watch and enjoy! Grade: A+
1,DO NOT BUY THIS REGISTER,"Although it seemed to be a good bargain, this register is fatally flawed in that it has no VOID function, no NEGATIVE function or key, and no paper journal; essentially your clerks had better be 100% accurate all the time, as there is NO system for correcting or even finding mistakes after a sale is completed. How the people at Royal could have missed installing such basic functions is beyond me. I can't even ask, as there is also NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT WHATSOEVER."
2,Too hard to read digital display,"I really need a watch with two time zones and a countdown timer. I like a digital and analog combination. I thought this would fit the bill. The drawbacks are that the bezel is blue and hard to see through. The digital functions are so small they are practically unreadable. Somehow I have an hourly alarm turned on and cannot figure out how to turn it off. Oh, one more thing, the band pinches the hair on my arm. Too bad, good price but does not come through for me."
1,Wish I could return it,"If you are hoping for photos. There's not one. If you are already familiar with Paris, there's nothing here that's eye-opening. Considering only 30-40 lines in this very tiny book is devoted to each restaurant/bakery/shop, nothing much is said. The large number of spelling mistakes in French could have used a good spell-checker. If you are new to Paris and just need some names, this could be of some use but make sure you do research on the internet to find out more about the restaurant before you go. Poujauran was sold years ago and the bakery that's there now, although good, is not of the same caliber. If I could return the book, I would."
4,A moving story...,"I first heard about David Brin's postman when the Kevin Costner movie was publicised on ""Entertainment Tonight"" (naturally!). Of course, we all know what happened to the movie but that should not deter someone from reading Brin's superb novel. As someone who loves to write letters, I could empathise with the villagers who relished receiving letters - the thought of communications reunifying the ""Restored States of America"" was a superb concept. Yes, I would like to read a sequel to the novel. Who knows, maybe someone else will have the opportunity to remake The Postman as a movie which has the vision that David Brin's novel has. Maybe a director of the calibre of Atom Agoyan can tackle a remake?"
3,Seems Like Two Separate Books,"The front half of this book is great. Gordon Krantz, struggling across the wilds of the Western United States, telling stories and singing songs to earn his keep along the way. A minstrel spinning tales reminding people who they are and what they were before a series of events called only The Doomwar. He continues doing the same but in a broader context after becoming the eponymous Postman.That's the front of the book.The second half, unfortunately, lacks that same power and wonder. The figure of adventure becomes little more than a bureaucrat, and the carefully crafted tale a hairy-chested men's science fiction adventure novel, complete with genre clich√©s and right-wing manifestos. And I like a good manifesto ..."
3,He of course knows this is not true,"The Postman is part of the end of world genre that I've always enjoyed. 16 years after a cataclysmic event a loner and wanderer stumbles upon a US Postal workers gear and invents a story in which to survive. He claims he is a representative of the restored United States of America and that the east coast will send reinforcements and supplies out west. He of course knows this is not true, but this fantasy brings hope to many people.This independent personality that invented the farce begins to believe his own fiction and suddenly goes from recluse to leader. The story quickly slips into a clich√©d comic book type ending of good and evil. I found the premise interesting but the actions of the individual characters, especially the protagonist's transformation to be far-fetched."
2,for fans of post-apocalyptic America,"To Brin's credit: this book moves along quickly, follows a nice formula, and goes roughly where you expect it to go with just enough twists to keep it engaging along the way.That said, this is also an exemplar of a very average novel about a ""post-apocalyptic America"". It makes me want to see the film with Costner. Just to compare.Also: Brin's attempt at being sympathetic to a woman's plight in this post-apocalyptic scenario? Fell way short. Trust me bro, these broads would be way tougher than you've painted them here. Even with a bunch of survivalist ex-soldiers with rampant genes and hormones."
1,Garbage...,"I am an avid reader and a fan of the ""post-apocalyptic"" genre, but I have to say, this book is utter garbage. I only read up to the third chapter or so... I couldn't take it. Terrible writing, disjointed pacing, awful introspective ramblings, and unrealistic, two-dimensional characters make for great kindling, and little else. It's the only book I've ever thrown away!"
3,bring on the mail,"this is an ingenius plot....a character to get behind is very much welcome, here it is Gordon Krantz...such an interesting idea, with villains that you actually dislike and you have yourself a good read...ive read this book twice now, and loved it both times...i just love the whole idea of moving the capital of the restored US to St. Paul...and how Krantz plays the role of government worker...this is an excellent book, well written, with a very interesting idea...worth the price at a bookstore? for me it was, others may be better off with a quick pickup at the library, because this is one of those books that you love or you hate"
4,"Was God killed by man, war or desease?","Mr. Brin's Postman is the story of the journey of Gordon, which never leads him to an inner life except to ask, who is going to save humanity from itself? The closest we ever get to something beyond the scope of human beings is Cyclops, the computer, who turns out to be the front for a group. The questions I ask are: Wouldn't the farmers have had some kind of worship service to a Higher Power? And, is Gordon going to California to find just more of the same or to find God? To me it is a good read on hopelessness and despair. Cause and effect."
2,The Movie's Better,"If you liked the movie...well, watch it again. It's way better than the book. Brin gets credit for the cool main idea, but it's developed better in the (notably different) movie. The execution in the book just isn't very good--and like most sci-fi, the book's poorly-written. By the standards of sci-fi, I guess it's o.k...maybe alright for the beach or whatever. But really just not very good. I love post-apocalyptic fiction, and even I found myself skimming to the end."
2,"Great document, outrageous price","I bought this book, new, for %5.25, when I was in graduate school. Shocked at how expensive it became even just a few years later, I created my own very similar document, and have made it available free for all on the Internet."
2,Poor Sound Quality,I bought these for my daughter because of the great reviews they received. We were very disappointed with the sound quality. If we turn the volume up higher than 1/4 way up the lever there is a terrible buzzing sound. I thought we just got a defective product so I had Amazon exchange them for a new pair. These sound just as bad out of the box as the original set. I am going to return them. I do not have experience with any other portable MP3 Player speakers so maybe these got great reviews because the others are all worse.
1,Not what you see,iPod does not sit on stand because you have to plug in to bottom of iPod. Would not recommend to anyone. You will find out how good Amazon's return policy is.
4,Not Bad Scooby Doo!,"This movie isn't bad, but it could be better though. I put this scooby doo movie second place to his last movie ""The Witches Ghost"". The only thing that I didn't like about this movie though is the obvious stuff in the mysteries. Like that evidence on the NASA people proved right up front that they were going around acting like green aliens. I also didn't like them showing us that the girl and the dog were the aliens at the last minute. Other than that, it is a good movie though."
1,NOT Malibu 2000!!!,"As another reviewer said, this is not Malibu 2000 as advertised. It is Malibu Swimmers' Water Action, and does not work as well as Malibu 2000, as I know from past experience. It is going back! The shipping was super fast, and the top was taped, so the item arrived intact."
4,Great fathers day gift,I got this for my dad for Father's day. It was the perfect gift. He absolutely loved it. Not to mention Amazon's price was great!
5,Totally unique 'think ouside the box' job hunt strategies,"In a world full of the same re-hashed, ho-hum job-seeking advice this book is a refreshing change. To job hunt successfully is to market one's self effectively. Kevin Donlin obviously has a marketing background and it shows in every powerful and unique strategy he teaches in this new book. Absolutely a must have for every job hunter.-Jimmy Sweeney, President-CareerJimmywww.Amazing-Cover-Letters.com"
1,jet engine,"Made the mistake of buying this fan over the web mostly because it is a pain to return things this way. I was looking for a quiet, but powerful fan. This vornado is powerful on the higher level (though the claim of moving air 70 feet is wishful thinking at best), but you might as well park a jet in your home with all of that noise. It is suprisingly noisy even at the lower speed with the motor making a high pitched clincky/ whirly, rythmic noise as if something was off center. I have a few cheaper fans at home that are quieter. In short don't waist your money, or at least buy one from a retailer that you can promptly return it to once you hear how loud this thing gets."
5,Excellent Fan,"A little on the pricey side, but it works great. It is quiet and compact and perfect. I like that it is difficult to get your hands near the blades, very safe around kids."
4,Good for what I need it for,"This fan does a good job for what I need. I have radiant heat in the ceiling, with cathedral ceilings. All the heat stays up. This fan keeps that air moving and getting the heat down, and does it quietly. I can have the fan (low) on and watch T.V. The fan is right next to the TV. If it is on hi, it's loud. Maybe not as loud as other fans, but loud. On low, it's quiet."
5,Vornado 630,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn't take up that much space but it really moves the air in the room. It actually helped me put off using the AC for a while. I still use the fan even with the AC as it circulates the air so well. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.Vornado Midsize 630 Air Circulator, 3 Speeds, CR1-0074-06"
1,Poorly Written,"Not very well written. Hillary wants to eliminate the roles of ""mother"" and ""father"" and instead turn children over to society at large. Bleh, socialist garbage. Also, numerous errors and incorrect references appeared throughout the text."
5,Hope Knows No Boundaries,"A delightful delve into the tortured soul of HRC. This book is a lipsmacking good time. Let me tell you, you will be thankful when you finally finish this. Your soul will be uplifted and your future will seem all the brighter knowing that you can get through anything, if you can get through this book.On a personal note, I salute Hillary for her good sense and the fact that she's been a Yankee fan all her life. And growing up in suburban Chicago, who can blame her? The New York Yankees are an ingrained part of every suburban Chicago child's life ... like Green River soda and the Empire carpets guy from TV. And for all the naysayers out there who say that it's common knowledge that suburban Chicago children follow the Montreal Expos and not the New York Yankees, I say, there is NOT even a team in Montreal anymore. So put that in your pocket and walk away, buster!"
1,It Didn't Take a Village for Hillary. It Took a Nanny!,"Gimme a break. For the millions of us mothers and fathers working the front lines with blood, sweat and tears, we understand all too well what it takes to raise children to excellence: hard work and perseverance! Through both the joys and the struggles of raising kids from birth to adulthood, excellence in parenting requires huge doses of time, energy, planning, and commitment. How would Hillary know that? It certainly didn't take a village for her to raise her daughter. It took a nanny."
3,Self Hypnosis?,I listened to the CD for about 2.5 weeks and really found very little change in my eating behavior. I liked his voice and found the CD more soothing than the other one I purchased. Listening to it at bedtime I found that I slept faster and had a more restfull sleep..but as far as loosing weight...found no relief.
4,Play is good read,"I saw this play in NYC with Jared Harris and Blair Brown and really enjoyed it. It was funny and moving and really had heart. When I picked it up to read it, I wondered if it would read as well -- and it did. This is a very smart play -- Charlotte Jones has written a play where the characters are fully realized and funny -- all the while searching for understanding, connection and love."
2,Shot In The Foot,"A great band with great songs. Yeah, I have all the 45's. What's with the horns ? They took bad advice at a critical time in their careers. I cringe when listening to this, knowing what could have been. I reviewed this only because I feel it could have been an important recording."
3,decent start,i'm a fan of trey and will continue to be. He definitely has the voice but I feel better songs should have been chosen for his debut. I enjoy listening to the album and can't wait to hear future material from him.
3,"hot single ""gotta make it""","trey songz album is nice , ""gotta make it"" is my favorite tracktwista added more flavor to it."
1,SORRY THIS CD IS A AVERAGE & BORING AND REMINDS ME A LOT OF LLOYD (SOUTHSIDE)!,THIS CD IS BORING I WANTED TO HAVE IT BUT I'M TOTTALY DISSAPOINTED I'VE GOT THIS CD 4 DAYS B4 IT REALESED CAUSE OF EBAY I WAS LISTING TO IT 2 TIMES IN A ROW CAUSE IT COST A LOT OF MONEY BUT I DIDNT FEEL IT.I WAS LISTING TO IT 3 DAYS JUST TO LIKE IT BUT IT IS BORING.HIS VOICE IS ON A LOT OF SONGS LIKE LLOYDS.SOME SONGS ARE GOOD BUT NOT NUFF FOR THIS MONEY AND FOUR 17 SONGS.DONT BUY IT BETTER GET TEAIRRA MARI AND GINUWINE.PLEASE BEST BELIEVE
1,defective,One corner of the grill was broken off when we took the grill out of the box! I wouldn't have thought cast iron could be easily broken like that. We're going to get a replacement and hopefuly that one was just a one time one of those things defect. So one star for now.
2,Not cast iron - very late delivery,Pieces do not fit together. Handle burned after 3 uses.Amazon was very late with delivery and has not returned any of the $100 delivery charge.Filed a complaint with Amazon but no reply.I will definitely not use Amazon again!
3,Not the greatest has many flaws,All the other neg. comments are true. I had to work on this grill to make it work me. I wish I had read ALL the other reviewers first. The legs are uneven. You have to scrub the black paint of the grills. The grills don't fit evenly and even cracked. I was able to grill but this grill won't last. I wish I had sent it back and saved up for a better made real cast iron grill.
5,Loving the hibatchi!,"Growing up, hibatchi grills were the only grills I ever remember my parents using. I have wanted one for a while and am really enjoying this one. I was concerned about the transition to cooking on such a small charcoal grill, but every thing I've cooked thus far has turned out perfect. I did season mine before using to cut down on rusting. Very easy to assemble.Feels like a trip back in time for me and am loving it! My daughter wants one now, so I will probably be making another purchase of one within the next month or so!"
1,Do not buy--this is a cheap piece of crap,I bought this grill for my husband for Father's Day. He kept it on the back porch covered with a grill cover. It's not even Thanksgiving and one of the grill handles fell off. The other area of concern is that the available grilling space is much smaller than the surface area of the grill. (The picture makes the available grilling area look much larger than it really is.) Another issue is that the grills do not sit evenly on the back support. I am getting him a Lodge for Christmas. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
2,some flaws,"The right grill piece didn't fit well in the brackets unless we put it in the top setting. Otherwise it leaned almost to the point of worrying the food will roll off!The 2nd time we used it, the wooden handle broke on the right grill. It's unfortunate because otherwise it seemed like a pretty well made item."
1,terrible,"the hibachi left side support bracket snapped off last night. imagine, a cast iron bracket snapping in two with no pressure on it. I was fortunate not to have a hot item on it at the time or I may have suffered serious burn injuries."
5,Quality and Performance,"This is a great piece of BBQ equipment. I wish they made everything as good as this. It holds heat extremely well and functions flawlessly. I am an avid barbecuer. I have a gas grill, smoker, and barbecue. And I am very, very happy with this added Hibachi."
4,Cast Iron Hibachi,"I love my Cast Iron Hibachi, as I got tired of buying the cheap brands that only lasted a season. Granted there are a few quirks, but I can live with them. All the parts were packaged and I was able to put it together with no problems at all. I also purchased a cover to protect it when not in use; hopefully, this will be the last Hibachi I will ever have to buy!"
3,Some mods required,"First the positive, great size as expected. Nothing cooks like cast iron and as it seasons will only work better. it's much cheaper to use than my larger grills and faster in coming to temp. I bought three of the grills and sent one to my son-in-law and the other to my brother-in-law. S-I-L says no problem with assembly, works great, no response yet from B-I-L. My experience, a bad cast prevented installing the right side grill handle. A little grinding took care of that. Casting problems also causes the right side grill plate to tilt down instead of sitting level. The metal in thinner on one edge and doesn't stay in the notch unless set well over the center mark."
4,Hibachi grill,"This is a very inexpensive and easy to use product. I love how heavy it is, can leave it outside and not worry about it blowing away. It certainly works well and meets my needs on my small deck."
4,Good Times,"Just what i had been looking for, good old school cast iron Hibachi grill. love it it's made for two, your self and that special person in your life. a nice glass of wine your favorite steak and your Hibachi grill. Wow doesn't get any better. the grill is solid durable, it'll be around for a long time, my recommendation it's a great buy"
2,Shame on Warner Bros. and the NFL,"These discs are so heavily copy-protected that they wouldn't play in my DVD player, making these the first perfectly undamaged DVDs that refused to do so. The back of the box carries a disclaimer warning that the discs will only play in ""licensed DVD players,"" whatever that means. Once I borrowed my roommate's computer to watch them, I was impressed by the quality of the documentaries and the great bonus footage. Too bad the manufacturer wants so badly to ""protect"" me from even playing my purchase on my own system. Extremely unsatisfying, buyer beware."
4,Good Book!,As a senior in high school I enjoyed this book but found it a little confusing at times. I think that this book is okay for Jr High and High school students too read as long as they can understand it and know the difference between real and fake.
2,not my favorite music program,"We have three ""educational"" music DVDs. The stand-out favorite is Classical Baby: the Music Show. The second choice is Trebellina. This is a distant third: I'd rank Baby Einstein and Laurie Berkner above this in terms of keeping my son interested while exposing him to music."
1,Big letdown,"I ordered this even after I saw some reviews that warned me against it because I couldn't find anything better and wanted an aquarium DVD. Why didn't I listen to the review that said the shots were too close? They are way too close even for a regular size TV. But that's not the only problem with this poor DVD:The backgrounds of the tanks are ugly and dlstracting.The fish are not very attractive and in the case of the koi, look distressed.The music is terrible and the bubble sound tremendously annoying.I was hoping this DVD would relieve stress. Instead, it created it. I wish Amazon had a full refund policy for opened items.So glad I bought Hawaiian Dreams from the Waves Virtual Vacations series. That one more than lives up to its billing.I think I may have to go out and shoot a better aquarium series. Does not seem to be a good one out there."
5,We LOVED it!!!,"Me and my husband love to entertain. When we have guest, we hate to have the T.V. playing because it's so distracting from the conversation. When we bought this DVD and had our first guest over, they loved it. It was beautiful and exotic. Aquariums are nice but so much work. We have a 50 inch HD TV that transforms into a gorgeous fish tank in a flash. We have really enjoyed our DVD and hope you do too.Steve and Selena in North Carolina"
2,Flip flop flippity flop,"Well, always start by saying something nice. Blue. Yeah. This toy is a nice shade of blue.And, once in, it does help get the lube spread around for bigger toys to come.Alright, only two nice things to say. Oh, wait -- it's cheap, too.So, the not so good ---- It is floppy. It's not quite long enough. It's just sorta there. Meh, I think, is the current way to describe it. Yeah, even double meh. Spend a little more and get something blue that is firmer, bigger,and less meh."
3,nice old war flick,"Ahh, the Brits the make great B/W war flicks...and the make good ones. It's ok, but worth it."
4,so many lovesongs....so little time,"Tanya says that this album is about waking up. And that is exactly what it feels like. No other song by anyone ever in all of history has made me cry like ""The Storm."" Tanya Donelly has the most spookily amazing ability to see beauty and tell other people about it. Buy this album now!"
4,A welcome return.,"Five years may have passed between 'Beautysleep' and 'Lovesongs for underdogs' but the quality of Tanya Donelly's writing remains as wonderful as ever. Songs such as 'The Storm' and 'Keeping You' are among the best she has ever written. The only reason this isn't a five star review is because of the uneven track listing which puts the two weakest tracks, 'Wrap Around Skirt' and 'Another Moment', in the centre of the album - somewhat spoiling the flow. Amends are made however with the hidden twelth track 'Head for math' which is simply beautiful."
2,Much Better Live,"STS9 has defined a new genre with their latest studio work: Elevator Trance. This album works better than a studio album. I came back from a concert festival fresh from a stunning STS9 show. I thought they were awesome, so I picked up this album. Yawn....use it as a sleeping pill if anything."
5,Great tribute to the legend of zelda,"This cd is a must have for any legend of zelda fan. This collection has songs from every major zelda release from the original up to windwaker and four swords adventures on it. The cd also has a bonus track which is a remix of multiple zelda themes. This is by far the longest track on the cd and is a nice addition to the other tracks found on the album. If you have purchased a games soundtrack before- then you know what to expect. If you have not, I must warn you that most songs are a minute or less in length (they usually only play through one cycle of the song). This can bother some people, however the short length makes the tracks perfect for use as ringtones so keep that in mind as well. Overall, this is a fine cd. Nintendo has done a fine job with this cd and I only hope that they keep producing these soundtracks for fanboys to listen to and enjoy."
5,eric ambler's best,"After I had read this book from the library, I bought one as a gift for son-in-law because the Levanter is a spellbinding novel with subject pertinent today. Then I bought this older edition for myself to re-read at a later time.The Levanter is well written and suspenseful with Interesting well-defined characters. One of the 5 best as rated by the Wall Street Journal's selections of thrillers and Eric Ambler's works. If you like Vince Flynn and ""24""or Alan Furst, you will probably like the Levanter, by Eric Ambler. Not quite so much action, but the same type of intrigue and plot twists with a recognizable hero. I also have bought other novels by this master story teller. He is amazingly current though this book is nearly 30 yrs old. You have to keep reminding yourself that the story is set and written in the 1980's because it deals with the middle east and bombs.Enjoy!!!"
1,I'LL PASS,"I like heavy metal. I don't like this. I saw Black Sabbath during their Master of Reality tour, I saw Judas Priest when they had Les Binks on drums, I've seen Loudness, Iron Maiden and Accept. I'm not here to bash this CD just because I don't like it. I know there's a market for this and this style of metal has its fans. I'm not one of them. Any time you have these growling 'I'm dying' vocals you instantly lose me. I find this style of metal depressing. If this your cup of tea then hey, go for it, enjoy the heck out of it. This just doesn't work for me on any level whatsoever."
5,Loved it,"Chimaira are made by mixing heavy, fast guitars, low bass, fast and complex drumming, weird (but cool) electronics/techno, loud screams, and a hint of rap. One thing about Chimaira that I liked especially was the electronics guy. It adds a really cool ""flavor"" to the music. It kinda reminded me of the mighty Slipknot, but even more so. The guitar riffs are a little repetive, but the guitarists are talented and fast. The drummer is very talented as well, he uses those double bass drums to their full extent. I suggest this to anyone that likes metal/techno, Slipknot fans, or just plain metal fans looking for something new. Standout tracks: Painting the White to Grey,Jade,Lumps, Taste My,Forced Life"
1,The most uninspired C.D. I've ever heard,"Listening to this C.D. first gave me a headache, then it made my stomache churn. It is SO uninspired, it's not even funny (or listenable). Yeah, it's loud, but I can be loud, too, if I had some pots and pans and a ""guitar."" Don't get this, it's nothing but d-r-i-v-e-l."
3,A good starting point...,"Okay, so their debut may not be the masterclass that their sophomore and third albums are hailed to be by fans but it still serves up some brutal tracks that will please any fan of the band. The first song I ever heard by this band was the impressive `Dead Inside' with creepy sound effects and infectious guitar and drum work. I was instantly intrigued, but it wasn't until listening to the entire album that I can say I was hooked. The best tracks here are the aforementioned, the brutally melodic `Painting the White to Grey', `Lumps', `Taste My...' and the borderline disturbing closer `Jade'. As a whole this album may run a little long and may contain some filler tracks but it's a good glimpse at what the band is capable of and it still fits nice in any music collection. Chimaira has done what every good band should, take what they've started with and grown, matured, into a better and stronger band!"
3,"easy, quick and value added",This alarm system is very easy to install <20 min including reading the directions.Qualifies for an insurance premium discount (pays for itself from day 1)Actually works too.
1,wanted for lying cheating stealing and making a bad event,this EVENT SUCKED I REGRET BUYING IT AND YOU WILL TO DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the only good match was the cruiserweight match but thats it!!!!!
2,MURPHINATOR IS COOL BUT THIS PAPER VIEW IS NOT,I GAVE THIS PAPER VIEW A 2 AND A HALF FOR TWO GOOD MATCHES- EDDIE VS BROCK BUT LESNAR CONTROLLED TOO MUCH AND CHAVO VS REY- GREAT MATCH A LOT OF HIGH RISK AND HATED ENDING. OK TRIPLE THREAT- BIG SLOW VS JOHN CENA VS KURT ANGLE- NO WEAPONS WHAT THE HELL AND DEFINENTLY NO HIGH SPOTS. REST OF THE MATCHES WERE GAY AND HAD NO SPARK. MURPHINATOR IS STILL COOL. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4,EDDIE EDDIE EDDIE!!!,Eddie Guererro wins the title over Brock Lesnar in a match of the year candidate! What more can you ask for from a WWE PPV?Chavo vs Rey was also solid and the 3way #1 Contenders match was solid as well... overall a good wwe ppv with the highspot def being Eddies title win over Brock. The crowd goes insane and this DVD is worth it just for that.
3,for someone with a small wrist,this watch is definitely made for someone with a small wrist told me that nine more words were required to post
3,Ok for the price,"This is about what I should have expected for the $7.00 I paid for it (it was on sale at the time). I would NEVER spend $21.95 on it, which is the list price at the time I'm writing this review. For the sale price it's a fine watch, but not worth full retail. The watch band is very plastic-y and not overly comfortable to wear. My arm gets a little sweaty under the band! But it functions fine and I use it when I'm working in the garden or doing something where a nicer watch might take a beating. If you're looking for a super-cheap watch that's not very pretty, this is a decent one for the (sale!) price."
2,NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE CALL,"This is one of Susan Howatch's shorter books before she became famous with the publication of Penmarric. While there is essentially nothing wrong with the story, it follows the tried and trusted Gothic formula - the heroine doesnt know who to trust and starts to suspect the man that she is becoming attracted to etc - there is nothing that stands out either.The whole premise ie Claire Sullivan travelling halfway around the world after a mangled message from her flighty sister is far fetched. After a whole lot of nothing, the end when the murder victim is found and the murder unmasked is dealt with too abruptly. If you are looking for a better Howatch short novel I would suggest The Shrouded Walls (four stars) and her best The Devil on Lammas Night (five stars)."
5,I LOVE THESE SONGS!,"I love ""I will come to you"" and ""Cried"". Hanson is a great band, so BUY THIS SINGLE!P.s. For all of you reading this, ""Cried"" was a previously unrealeased song. It's pretty cool!"
5,"A masterpiece given due, regal trappings by Criterion","A monumental work - the definitive film on the creative impulse and the consequential search for perfection (masterfully framed as the story of a 14th century monk). From its haunting, seemingly incongrous beginning (think of it as a ""visual overture"", synopsising the film's themes much like an opera's overture does for its musical motifs) to its devastating ending, Rublev is awe inspiring in its depth, scope, and artistry. A sometimes difficult film whose rewards go beyond today's most extravagant expectations out of film. Its imagery and final claim haunt me, informing my thoughts and responses."
4,"Stunning, but animals horribly abused in the making of this","This film was undoubtedly extraordinary in a number of ways, but I felt compelled to write this - there are two distrssing scenes in the film which depict two animals genuinely, unmistakably being brutalised in ways that could never have been faked, especially back in 1964 when the film was made. In one scene, a cow is running around, on fire, the flames licking its hide. In another scene, a horse falls from a wall to the ground fifteen feet below, and clearly breaks its leg, unable to get up. You can talk about Tarkovsky's humanity all you want, but obviously animal life was cheap in Russia. You can't have humanity and a blatant disregard for animals' lives at the same time. Anyone who loves animals should be warned of these truly distressing scenes."
4,A Cinematic Work of Art,"Caution! This film is well worth watching BUT only for those who are willing to take the time and effort (nearly 3 hrs - at least) to watch and think about the meaning of the various stories that make up this epic work of art. Perhaps the film can be viewed and enjoyed in a single sitting, but I doubt it. The closest analogy I can offer is that watching the film is like viewing fine paintings in an art gallery or savoring the taste and aroma of vintage wines. Visually the scenes are striking with many panoramic views. The use of black and white (until the very last few minutes of the film) creates a hypnotic, dream-like effect that heightens the mood of the scenes. As others have pointed out, there are some scenes that show cruel treatment of animals and barbaric treatment of human beings."
5,Being Andrei Tarkovsky.,"The first time I saw Andrei Rublev I fell asleep after the first fifteen minutes. The second time I saw it I stayed wide awake for the entire viewing. I was impressed by its visual grandeur and its message so much that it is one of the five best films that I have ever seen. It is one of the first films to convince me that that excellent films can be extremely challenging to watch. Despite some of the most disturbing scenes I have ever scene, I no longer view film as a diversion but as an exploration. It is atmospheric, heavenly, gothic, spooky, dreamy, frightening, and thought-provoking. The definitive 205-minute version released by Criterion does an excellent job in restoring some very important scenes which add to the flow of the film and make it easier to understand. I highly recommend it."
3,"Beware,","This is not 165 min movie, as description states, this is a 200 minute version without several major scenes. While this still is a great movie, I would prefer a more concentrated version."
2,Doesn't Fit True to Size,"I was looking for a comfortable wedge heeled shoe to wear with jeans, and disappointingly, this wasn't it. I wear a size 8-1/2 M and rarely have to order anything other than my true size. This shoe was tight in the toes and very uncomfortable -- they felt too small and a bit on the narrow side. I didn't think ordering a half size up would resolve the problem and honestly didn't want to have the hassle of exchanging them with the risk of the replacement size not working out well, either. I opted to return these."
5,The World Could Use Much More of This...,"This is NOT a new age collection of meditation music. It IS a collection laid-back, and sometimes spacey, tunes by top notch performers from around the world, including Angelique Kidjo, Salif Keita and Ali Farka Toure. What binds the cd together is the ethereal beauty of each selection, the result of which will leave you in a peaceful mood.I've listened to this countless times, and it never fails to make me feel good and renew my spirits. And with all of the stress and violence in this world, it's a blessing to have musical sanctuaries like this available to us. Highly Recommended."
5,Moving with Rhythm and Joy,I saw this group on a Canadian TV show when I lived in the Adirondacks of NY. Fell immediately in like and bought the CD on line. I have shared with friends who only knew the classical world and they also bought copies. What they did with Que Sera Sera using almost Kurt Weilian dark tones was uplifting. I encourage one and all to add this to their collection.
4,"If you like this one, check out ""Latenight Betty""","This is a fine CD representing the hard work of many talented musicians. However, its strength lies in the authentic Latin vocal performance of Pepe Raphael. A native of Madrid, Raphael brings his Latin roots to full force in ""La Soledad"", one of the two original tracks on this CD, and displays a more up-beat side in ""Donde Estas Yolana"". While we are all eagerly anticipating a long overdue second release from Pink Matini, those of you out there wanting more from Mr. Raphael must check out the debut release of Pepe & The Bottle Blondes ""Latenight Betty"" now available. This CD shows Pepe Raphael at his best, complimented by spectacular three-part harmonies of the Bottle Blondes and backed by a five-piece horn section and a solid Latin rythym section. Latenight Betty is high energy fun from top to bottom. A must have for fans of Pepe Raphael."
3,Not what I expected,"The instrumental portions of the CD are great, but I don't care for the songs that include the female vocal. I was hoping for an all-instrumental album."
4,"Great, but French is terrible","The music is really great, but her French accent is so deplorable I can hardly listen to Sympathique. It sounds very American teenager speaking French in a high school class. The music is wonderful if you can deal with that."
5,Question About This Set...,"I would really like to purchase this set but I am puzzled about the aspect ratio of this complete collection... is states that it is 1.33 which translates to full screen aspect when watching. In doing some research on this set, elsewhere for sale I have seen this collection listed as 'various movies full-screen and some widescreen'... are all these films in this collection full-screen? Is there a different version out that there that contains some widescreen films in this set ? It sounds like an amazing set but I don't want to purchase full screen films and then later on have to re-purchase in widescreen. Thank you very much for any assistance anyone can pass along :)"
2,Buy a newer camera,"I own this camera and while it was very good in 2002-2003 the years have passed it by. There are other cameras with more megapixels, faster response time, better battery life, lighter weight, better lens, etc. Plus they cost the same or less than this camera is advertised for here. I still use it because I bought the waterproof case (up to 100ft depth!) and I use that regularly. You can probably find used s230s for way less than the prices here if you really want it."
4,First decent cam I bought,"I had bought several other digi cams b4 this one and hated them all. This one is very easy to use, pics come out clear, and easy to carry around because of its small size. I guess the only downside ive discovered so far, is because of its small size, the buttons are hard to use sometimes, especially for someone with larger hands, ie a man, for example. Other then that, I would recommend to anyone for a first cam, to get your feet wet in the digital camera market. Well worth the price."
4,"Awesome, feature-laden little camera","This is a fantastic camera. I bought it for my wife as a general point and shoot and after playing with it found it to be far more capable. Excellent feedback, easy menus, lots of little ""neato"" features such as black and white, sepia toning, oversaturdation, signal histograms, 50-400 ISO range, video recording, etc. Enough features to make it a worthy tool for even more serious photography.It's shortfalls are few. It lacks a manual focus capability, the zoom range is limited, video record times are somewhat limited, and though its small size is abundantly convenient, it makes holding the camera steady for slow shutter and telephoto shots difficult.Nevertheless, it is a lot of camera for the price. Go to Amazon and spend the $... to buy a 128MB or 256MB Compact Flash card. The extra storage will be appreciated. Enjoy!"
3,good camera but see other,"Cannon S230 is a good camera , it gives beautiful and sharp pictures, but as compared to Cybershots from SONY, the camera lacks lots of features likeThe movie is limited to time frame of 3 minutes as compared to Cybershots where movie is limited with the size of memory.The Cybershots have special modes for taking pics at night, snow, beach and other special conditions.The camera has 2x optical zoom, which is pretty low.The camera dos not show battery time as compared to other Cybershots.In all , I would prefer to spend more money on Cybershots rather than paying for Powershots"
4,Red-eye problem,"I shopped for a digital camera for about 2 months, I went through 2 cameras. Olympus D520 and Canon S200. I finally bought the Canon S230 and was not fully satisfied with the red-eye reduction. 80% of my pictures that were taken at night or in the dark with the red-eye reduction selected, have red-eye on the picture. With the sofware available now, it could be removed, but why pay so much for a camera that should do it by itself. I would pay more and get the new S400."
5,Amazing digital color!,"As a part-time graphic designer, I truly appreciate the picture quality that you get with this camera! This is my second digital camera and the 3.2 megapixels is great if you want to print up 8X10 pictures and don't have a necessity to print poster size pictures. If you want to print 11X14 and bigger pictures, you may want to consider the Canon Powershot S400.I am very happy with this camera!"
2,Rate this book XXX for explicit sex scenes,"I found this book not only boring, but absolutely not suitable for anyone under 18 because of the (to me) gratuitis and explicit sex scenes involving, woman/woman, man/woman threesome, etc. I absolutely had no expectation of this when I began reading. Also, the book is very boring, very little in the way of any ""action"", mostly a lot of (I presume) the author's philosophy. I skimmed through to the end, in hopes of something interesting occuring, but to no avail. I will not buy any of his books in the future!!"
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"This is a piece of junk. I agree with ""majjosephcooper"" that the max write speed is just 2x even on 8x DVD +R media. I just wasted my money on buying this product."
5,Rodale,The Rodale work has been my Organic Gardening Bibles for years. I love their world view and wish more would learn how to use what they know to develop nutritious home eating.
2,"""Colloquial"" books are not suitable for beginners.","I would not advise anyone to use books from the ""Colloquial"" series if they wish to start learning a language. The learner is expected to absorb a very large vocabulary and learn a great many new structures at a far greater pace than the average person is able to do. This is hard enough for a language very similar to English, but for a difficult language like Chinese the approach used in this series is quite unsuitable for beginners."
3,short and sweet,"this video came with Terrance, which makes me wonder if it is really old. i don't think they sell Terrance individually anymore. my 2 year old is perfectly happy with it, although it isn't the most visually appealing of the Thomas characters. the DVD is very short, but the stories seem just as good as all the other stories to a 2 year old (and unfortunately just as bad as all the other stories to a mother)"
2,A Weak Entry,"We have two little boys who both love Thomas and own most of the older dvds. Sadly, we have found many of the newer titles to be lacking in story quality. As they are no longer basing the stories on existing Thomas written stories, one begins to get the feeling that the point of these new dvds is to sell you on new toy designs.This particular dvd seemed like it would appeal to our truck-loving toddler, but it just doesn't hold his interest. The engines are barely featured at all except to ferry the various trucks back and forth. The stories are not very interesting and there is nothing on this dvd that makes them want to watch it again and again. The voice acting is particularly bad on this one as well.My advice? Rent this one if you're curious and save your money for the better entries in this series."
1,Absolute Waste of Time and Money,"I've had the Langka kit for 10 months and I've tried it on at least 3 dozen chips over 4 cars. For each, the results were the same... the blob eliminator removed all of the touch up paint I had put in the chip. I've tried waiting 10 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 2 days, 5 days, and 7 days. I have also tried every technique and variant of the instructions that I could find on the internet. Nothing works. The Langka system is an absolute wasting of time and money."
1,Just like all others,If you are not a professionel vaxer it doesn't work. The star is for the design
2,Poor Manufacturing,"What a disappointment this CD is. The songs are awesome and really kick, unfortunately track 11 never gets past the 4:20 mark. The label lists it as an 8:00 plus song. I've bought this CD four times and each one has had the same problem. I tried to call the label but only got voice mail. Really too bad because this could be a truely fantastic blues/rock recording. Hopefully they will get it fixed, I would really like to hear what the last song sounds like."
5,Way to Go Bill Martin and Eric Carle! Great classic books!,"My son has loved this book and Polar Bear, Polar Bear since he was 1 1/2 and he is now 3. He learned his colors and animals as well as enjoyed the rythmatic way the book reads. He reads this book to me all the time from memory and it is a book we treasure in our house. My nephew has it now too and at 2 1/2 reads it to his mommy too!Get this book! Take it out from the library and see your child's reaction if you don't believe me. By the time the book is due back, you will be headed to the book store to buy it!"
4,Brown Bear,Beautiful pictures and teaching tool for toddlers and preschoolers. I use it with the beautiful lullaby type Greg and Steve recording of the song with the same words.
5,You'll be surprised,"When I purchased this book I was disappointed. I did not like the pictures. I thought the ""dog"" looked pretty darn scarey. However, from 3 month old our little one has been enthralled with this book. To date it is still his favorite, and a book we buy for other little ones."
5,My daughter loves this book,"My daughter loves this book and gets excited everytime it comes out. She likes the animals, colors, and rhymes. For me the book is rather repetative and I'd rather read something with a story. Still it is for her so I grin and take pleasure in her enjoyment."
5,A family favorite,"The easy rythm of this book makes it an easy one to read over and over and over... The illustrations are fantastic. They are creative and encouraged my son to experiment with his finger painting in a new way. (After we discussed it of course.) This is an excellent introduction to colors and you can use this as a jump off for other senses- we talk about the sounds, the colors and the food the animals in this book eat. It is a lot of fun.I like books that you can use as an introduction to a new idea or to reteach an old one. THis book is well worth th money because there are so many things you can teach using this little book.Enjoy."
4,Instructional for toddlers.,"This book was initially well-received by my toddler, but has since lost some of its luster. Whether the story line or the illustrations, I suppose appeal is subjective, regardless of the age.At any rate, this book goes from page to page, asking each animal what is seen. The response is always an animal of a different color, so the book is educational for its identification of both animals and colors. I like it for that reason.The book is a good one to have in your toddler's library. I recommend it."
2,"Teaches colors, that's about it","Like all of the author's books, the characters in this book are so stylized that they hardly hold any semblance to reality. Really seems inappropriate for young chilldren if you actually want to teach them what these animals look like. It is certainly passable if teaching colors is the only goal."
4,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?","Great book, a classic, that is now being enjoyed by my niece."
5,Best Book Ever!,This is the favorite book of both of my kids. They are a little old for it now but when they were under 2 it was the best. We have a few copies of it... and will pass it down to the next generation. LOVE it!
5,i love it,"this is a great book, bright colours and learning the animals is fun for baby. i would def. recommend this book"
5,nice,"As a preschool teacher, I know that there isn't another book in my library that the little ones know word for word, and they love it"
3,"Informative, but flawed","The first half of the book was enthralling in its description of how the Bush family and the House of Saud became entangled with each other, but the post 9/11 chapters degenerate into innuendoes found in conspiracy theory and idle speculation.This is an informative look at the Bush family's dealings with the Saudis, but the last half of the book needed to be as factual and straightforward as the first half. Unger seemed to imply complicity of the Bush administration in 9/11, and until that is proven beyond reproach, I'm not buying it."
3,"Interesting, but .....","I have the audio version and found it interesting and upsetting, but not soley for the obvious reasons. Are the common folk simply pawns to these people who plan wars and assasinations where hundreds of innocent people are killed, with no regard to life.Bush called Saddam and Osama evildoers, murderers. Isn't he and his Saudi brethren cut from the same cloth? I know this in naive, but what is needed is a total transformation of human motivation, ideology and governmental structure.Further, while I have no way of knowing if all the facts of this book are true, it is certain that nefarious deals are the way of the world. How much money is enough?I further find it despicable that a hundred of so despots who happen to live above a buried field of oil should have become so influential. Perhaps, we invaded the wrong country."
1,sticky aphid for stink bugs,It didn't work at all for the stink bugs in my deck. Perhaps it is intended to attract other types of insects; It doesn't attract stink bugs.
4,They are yellow and sticky,"Sticky traps are not for control they're to be able to tellHow severe an infestation you have, they do work wellIn that regard."
4,great quality but very expensive,"moleskins are, without a doubt, glorious to write in. however they are also crazy expensive. if you're willing to spend the money, you won't regret buying one. if you're scared by the price and fancy paper is not your guilty pleasure, i would steer clear...they are still just notebooks."
5,Awsome Journal,What a classic journal. The Moleskine is perfect for your morning Bible reading and then writing down some thoughts you got from your reading. I use them all the time.
3,"It's nice, but not for me.","I've been using Moleskins for a while now and have a dozen or so. I needed one and went to a local store and all I could find was the softcover. I got it and am disappointed. I do love the feel of the soft cover and the quality is as good as ever. But I write on my lap and it's just not stiff enough for that. Maybe I should make some chipboard stiffeners at least to get me through this journal. I was concerned that they switched but that is not the case. I hope the store I went to, B&N, will have the option to get the hardcover again since I usually wait until the last minute to get a replacement."
3,not what I thought,I thought I was ordering full size (Large) notebooks but received pocket sized ones instead. I am returning them and reordering the ones I wanted and need
2,Not for Fountain Pens,These notebooks are really popular for some reason and I do not understand it. The paper quality is very inconsistent and they are expensive for the quality. I have had two of these things and one had relatively smooth paper and one had horrible paper. If you write with a fountain pen this paper definitely is not for you. The ink with bleed and feather.If you want a nice notebook look into Rhodia and Clairefontaine...their paper quality is consistent and just about the highest quality writing paper you can find.
2,Fell apart many times.,"I hate rating anything Moleskine lower than 4 stars, but I have to. As with the previous commenter, the entire cover fell off. I super-glued it back on, and it fell off again. Then I tried a hot glue gun, and it worked... halfway (it is already half ""off"" again). The bottom part of the little pocket in the back is splitting as well, and some of my little papers are falling out. This is my ""work"" notebook and stays there; I don't throw it around and carry it everywhere or anything. I'll be getting a hardcover next time."
5,I drank the Kool-Aid,"I always wondered what the draw to moleskine was all about. Now I know. This thing is simple, elegant, handy, understated. Its a waste to use this as you would a $1.99 note book from Wal-Mart. There is a ton of information out there about using the moleskine in a GTD (Getting Things Done, by David Allen) system. This is an absolute lifesaver.The notebook I ordered was in perfect condition upon arrival. I couldn't wait for it to get here after I ordered it, but it took me more than a week to start writing in it because I is just such a wonderful book that I couldn't bring myself to ""degrade"" it. :) Well I did finally.If you are looking for a simple, elegant, ""easy to have at all times"" notebook, this is the one for you!"
4,It is a good notebook.,"The notebook is fine, I just didn't have it in the time frame I needed. Not their fault. I use it almost everyday in class. And I am saving my other notebook to give as a gift to my best friend leaving to join the Navy."
1,"This is not a ""large"" Moleskine notebook","The 2 Moleskine notebooks I received were not ""large"" - they were 8.25"" tall, but only 5"" wide. The Moleskine notebooks I prefer to use are 9.75"" tall by 7.5"" wide."
1,Not good,"Pages not numbered, strap is cheesy in quality. I much prefer my refillable Montblanc leather notepad, pages tear oout easily or can stay in."
5,Still love the originals.,"Despite having Prime it still took 5 days to get to me which is the only bad thing I can say about ordering this notebook. Simply put, Moleskine makes the best notebooks around. I purchased this one to replace my close to 8 year old one. It had been through numerous rainy days in my backpack, all kinds of scribbled notes and drawings over the years and served me well. Eventually the pages ran out and I transfered all the vital stuff to start out my new one."
4,As close to what I wanted as it gets,"As a writer and a new mother, I'm often one hand and writing surface short when I get ideas I want to jot down.I was looking for a medium sized, reporter style pad like this (except with a a hard cover and spiral binding...).I've owned a number of moleskine journals over the years and have always been pleased. This one doesn't disappoint. It's easy to position and due to it's size, the outside edge of my hand is able to hold it down while I write...unlike a smaller pad of this style.As is the case with almost ALL top-bound journals, when I flip to the next page it's difficult to get full use of the top areas. Hence the desire for spiral bound.Regardless, this is a great little journal and I'd recommend it."
5,Moleskine Notebook,"I've been using Moleskine products for years. I have tried the imitations and found them always lacking in the quality that is attendant to a Moleskine notebook. If you want quality, buy the Moleskine."
5,"Best Notebook on Earth, Hands Down","Moleskine makes the best notebooks, and the large, ruled is my go-to version. The paper feels crisp and clean. There's a pocket in the pack for stowing photos, etc. The elastic strap ensures that the notebook stays closed. There's even a ""Property of; reward if found"" page inside the front cover so that if you lose your notebook when you're halfway done writing your novel, some good soul can return it to you."
2,Overpriced Mediocre Notebook,"Yeah, Moleskines have a cult following among those of us who journal or otherwise love a good notebook, but that following is largely undeserved. Moles are overpriced, poor-quality products. Their paper is thin and cheap (except for some of the specialty books, like the sketchbook), they cost about three times what they should, and really the name is all that you're paying for. Piccadilly makes an essentially identical product for a much more reasonable price. Don't waste your money on a Moleskine unless you're one of those trendoid nitwits who has to have the designer label on everything."
1,Legendary notebook with a bad quality paper,"I bought Moleskine notebooks back in the good old days before the small French quality manufacturer got acquired by the current company (I think it's an Italian mega consortium who doesn't give a fly about notebooks or paper.) That resulted in the company moving their manufacturing to China and marketing the brand to keep high profit margins.Now, who cares about the brand, when the most important part in a notebook is the paper quality and the bounding. I have to agree with most people who complain about the paper quality in the notebook: it's very low and subpart to even a composition book I can get at Office Depot for 1/10 of the price (See high profit margins above.) For a better quality artist notebook, I now use Canson (made in France) and for taking notes I switched a long time ago to Boorum & Pease (Columner books made in USA.)Sorry Moleskine but your ""legendary notebooks"" (TM) are just plain... legendary."
2,They Changed It,"I love Moleskine. But this latest large ruled journal had darker ruled printed lines on the page. This is the first time I've encountered this. I use my ruled notebook as a sketch book too, and the dark lines are too pronounced to go with any sketches or drawings. I have Moleskine sketchbooks as well. But I draw in all my Moleskine journals. If this is a change, I request you put it back the way it was. If it's a quality control thing, then here's the Quality Control # D00506T from my journal. I will continue to buy Moleskines. But I like the ruled lines less pronounced."
5,Would have been a great gift,"I had this watch in my possession for less than 24 hours. I bought this as a gift for my father in law who unfortunately did not get the pleasure of wearing it. It was taken away by customs or baggage handlers while traveling to Europe. I was left with the box only, they even took the warranty booklet.I only had the chance of holding it once after purchasing it - felt good solid construction, a little bit too shiny and noisy when shaken though."
4,Americans Love the Underdog!,"This is the first Peter Carey book that I have ever read, his winning this year's Booker award sparked my interest or I may have never read this masterful work of storytelling. Be patient with the first 40-50 pages, it takes some practice to become comfortable with Carey's writing style. Once you are beyond the early pages this book will pull you in and it won't let you go until the ending which I would never dare spoil. Ned Kelly, the anti-hero is a true ""Everyman"" and ""Underdog"". In his day he may have been a thorn in the government's backside, but trust me he will soon become one of your favorite characters. Let's call him a humble Robin Hood type. Happy reading!"
1,I just didn't buy it!,"This novel was the romanticized life of another gangster like Billy the Kid or Jesse James, but I never felt any sympathy for the main character at all, and thus, I'm not sure what Peter Carey's objective was. Why write a novel about a character that we're not supposed to have any emotional involvement with? Through the completely excessive amount of pages in this book, I ended up thinking that Ned Kelly was simply stupid. He made bad choices as a result of his idiocy, not because of some larger issue like repressive society, or mental illness, or anything broad reaching and universal (though some would argue that stupidity is universal), so rather than feel sorry for him, or want him to raise himself up, I just wanted him to be shot and have the novel over with.Usually Booker prize winners are a sure thing, but this one was definitely a miss. I gave the book away the second I finished it."
1,"No, he's right. It's bad","This book is an inspiration to mediocre writer's everywhere. This book is 90-some pages and took me a MONTH to read. The writing is so amateurish and BAD that is hit me like a brick. I honestly could not believe some of these passages as I read them.Now thats all pretty harmless. Steve Alten's MEG and TRENCH don't exactly exhibit high degrees of complex narrative or exposition, but it was fun and professional. This book just downright [smells.] I could forgive the laughable writing style if only it was fun. The attacks are sterile, unimaginative, predictable , and not exciting. There is no flair or excitement, no visceral thrills. The finale is an assembly line-fiery-explosion affair, and the text consistantly contains errors. Let me put it this way: this book makes the Resident Evil series look like ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDEGet WHITE DEATH instead, and in August, Alten will release PRIMAL WATERS, the 3rd in the MEG trilogy"
1,One of the Worst Books I Ever Read,"The title says it all. I am just wondering if this is a vanity press book (where the author pays to have the book published). You might enjoy it if you like the See Spot Run! Run, Spot, run! method of writing, with short exclamatory sentences (I haven't seen so many exclamation points since grade school). I can't imagine any self-respecting publisher actually paying money for this. Don't waste yours."
2,Another Supremes slap in their faces,"Granted, the title of the book is DIANA ROSS, but once again, Miss Ross has done her SUPER SOLO STAR thing and completely shunned her Supremes history by omitting pix of her with the group...much in the same fashion she zooms thru The Supremes' Medley at the beginning of her concerts....to get it OUT of the way! Too bad...it usually gets the biggest ovation!!Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong......please....dig in your photo albums and give the fans what we really want!"
1,melts like ice in boiling water,"I love the fragrance and it leaves a wonderful fragrance on the skin. It does leave your skin soft, but we were only able to get 16 showers from it and I watched as it literally shrank to nothing in my hand as I used it. I do not spend an excessive amount of time showering and typically get around 2-3 weeks worth of use from a bar of soap before it disappears to nothing (with two of us using it~~sometimes twice daily when we have 95 degree days!). We opened the soap on Thursday evening and by the following Tuesday morning, it was just a thin shadow of what it once was. Very disappointed in the longevity of it! Will not purchase it again even if it does smell wonderful!"
4,Not sure about the CD version,"I may well be a victim of high-end hearing loss, but I have such vivid memories of the guitar tones on the vinyl album, and I find myself straining to hear the thrilling edge in Verlaine's and Lloyd's playing on the CD.I am not an anti-CD warrior - I no longer have a turntable (although if I still had my original copy of Marquee Moon, I might be tempted to buy one) - but my impression is that this was a quick-n-dirty CD release, and I would gladly buy a re-engineered version (esp. with unreleased songs).It's still a fantastic CD, but I feel like the guitars were much more gutsy on vinyl. If Richard Lloyd or Tom Verlaine are out there, I would love to hear either of their opinions."
3,Average,"Marquee Moon has been given a lot of acclaim as one of the best albums to come out of the 1970's new wave scene. Though this album has its moments, nothing is as memorable as the best works from either the Modern Lovers or Talking Heads. The ten minute title track is the album centerpiece, a swirling mix of guitar and synthesizers that is part sublime, part tedious."
2,"Great playing, horrible singing","This is perhaps the most overrated album of rock music. Reviewers always rave about the powerful playing but provide little warning about the horrific singing. True, the rythems, the interplay among musicians and the guitar duals are fantastic. However, the cd is almost unlistenable because of Tom Verlaine's terrible vocals, which sound like, as Jerry Seinfeld decribed his date's laugh, ""Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer""."
2,stop singing and play!!,"I agree with all the reviewers who point out that Verlaine's voice is so abysmal that it's tough to enjoy this record. From an instrumental standpoint it's genuinely superb, but a lot of the songs collapse either because of Verlaine's voice or because they are simply far longer than they ought to be. You don't have to be a Hootie and the Blowfish fan (I'm certainly not!!) to disagree with the critics on this one. A lot of great music came out of the CBGBs scene, but I'll take the Talking Heads or even Blondie any day over this pretentious nonsense."
2,"overrated, boring","Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success. Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right. The bands from this era and ""scene"" that made it big were all better than Television. This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it. It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, ""oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!"". BULLOCKS!!! Clean out your ears and stop being so pretentious."
1,Formula Resurfaced yet still visible,"It's not funny, unless you're a moron. It's not suspenseful. The ""mystery"" is predictable to anyone who has seen more than one television suspense show. The characters are hollow. The interaction is tedious. And despite some hopeful signs of drug use, there are no hallucinations or grand insights. In fact, this book is entropy, resurfaced, and should be recycled immediately so we can print something more stimulating on the pulp, like perhaps instruction manuals for screwdrivers."
3,flat tire,"I love reading Bill Fitzhugh novels, but this one was my least favorite of the bunch. Being a huge music fan, as is Fitzhugh, I had high hopes for this one, but it really disappointed me. Perhaps the least funny of all his novels, and the plot wasn't as sharp as the others either. Maybe that's one reason this title has yet to appear as a paperback (which is still kind of odd, even considering it may not have sold as well as previous titles). I certainly won't give up on reading Fitzhugh's novels, and I hope he has plenty more in the tank, but this ""Resurfaced"" novel feels like a flat tire compared to his other gems."
5,Fitzhugh doe's it again.,"I've now read all of Bill Fitzhugh's novels and think he just gets better and better. This is his second book starring Rick Shannon. This time Mr. Shannon is caught in the middle of a old time Mississippi family feud, while trying to solve a murder. Also involved is a quartet of octogenarian blues artists who may or may not have recorded some songs together about 50 years ago. In typical Fitzhugh style is a mix of totally strange characters. A worthy read. Thumbs up Bill."
4,black rockport slipper,"This slipper is amazing, I want to wear it everywhere.It's true to size and very comfortable. You can stand in it all day and feel no discomfort. I was surprise at how light-weight it is. The front is a bit on the loose side, but its a good slipper."
3,It's not GS's fault...,"Doesn't work on PS3 (the disc swap) so I had to dust off the old PS2 which just seems like far too much work just for an ""All Items"" code for Legend of Dragoon"
4,Five episodes of Sora's sometimes-misguided adventures,"KALEIDO STAR: NEW WINGS is a fun show following Sora's journey to becoming a Kaleido Star. This comes from Season 2, Volume 1 of ECLIPSE OF THE STAR and holds five episodes surrounding Sora's sometimes-misguided eagerness, with strong animation by GDH-Hal in a zany, fun adventure even newcomers will enjoy."
5,Can't Beat this Filter!,"10K without an oil/filter change? Being of the old school (oil change every 3K/miles) I'm not completely convinced one should go that long without a new filter. But combined with synthetic oil, I think it is doable. I'll still probably still change after 7K. That's still a hell of a lot longer of a break than I am used to. Great product!"
5,"Vastly underrated, quite wonderful album","Much as I love MARQUEE MOON, Television's debut, it's their second album I find I tend to play much more often. Don't know where the preference comes from, but ADVENTURE has some of Verlaine and Lloyd's most lyrical guitar interplay, and songs like ""Days"" and ""Ain't That Nothin'"" lodge in the ear and can't get dislodged. A wonderful album that should've gotten better promotion."
1,Awful.,"I actually almost recommend this book, if you're getting it as a gag gift to a friend with a kitschy sense of humor. This poetry could have been written by a child. She uses generic and shallow language that ultimately expresses a boringly overserious perspective on ""the world""--a favorite topic of this book. I'm sure she had some intense experiences, but she never mentions any of the details. It's basically a bad blog diary written by a narcissistic WASPy Christian woman."
1,rip off,Ok so I have nothing positive to say about this fishing pole. I should have bought my [....] an adult pole for the same kind of money. Its a completely over priced hunk of junk! I spent several hours trying and retrying to get it to work right. It would shoot then the line would tangle. The bobber failed to release the bait. It shot tops 15 feet into the water. In total we actually used it fishing (not trying to get it to work) maybe 3 shots with bait before fustration got the best of us. I recommend not wasting your money. The concept is great the pole just isn't. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten recalled yet.
1,Buy your kids a Spincasting combo instead,"I saw a couple of little kids with these while I was fishing with my two kids. Of course, my kids thought they looked cool (they saw them on TV) and asked if they could have them. That was until they saw them in action. They launched a pathetic 15 feet maximum. Seemed like they were too difficult for the kids to ""pump"". For the $30 each they cost, I bought two Shakespeare Spincasting combos that came with hooks, lures, etc. My kids caught a dozen or more Sunnies each. The kids with these rocket rods didn't even get a bite. They were bored after about 20 minutes and left."
4,too cool for words,"my 8 yr old was very excited to get this toy. We've practiced in the backyard and we're now ready for the real thing. It took me some time to figure out hor to re-string the rod after line got snagged, but I did. It only comes with one launcher thing for your line and hook, but there is a replacement for three of them for around $[...]"
1,Rocket fishing rod........................,I gave this 1 star because they don't allow 0. this thing is junk. only shoots 15 to 20 ft. the reel is very weak. me and my 4 year old used it for 2 hours and then it broke. the reel quit reeling. the bobber is too hard to get back in the shaft. whoever invented this should give money back. Please do not buy this for your kids.
1,"It shouldn't have been sold in the USA, possikble lead poisoning.","My grandson brought his Rocket Fishing Rods, still in its packaging, over to my house. While I was reading the back of the packing, I came ,across a note telling kids to wash their hands after use because of lead content. This piece of crap came from China (where else would it come from but, China). The safety commission isn't doing their job well, the shipment shouldn't have gotten past the loading dock inspection center. Because of the lead content, this fishing rod should be recalled."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"This is more of an ""inspired by"" work than a game soundtrack. They don't even have the title song, along with lots of other good music from the game. Do not buy - waste of money with the price tag. I feel cheated."
2,"Works for resting heart rate, not active","I purchased the watch because I didn't want a chest-strap heart-rate monitor. I've only successfully measured heart rates in the range 40-90 bpm; higher than that it has always failed. It goes into the ""checking heart rate"" mode and sits there for up to a full minute without displaying. Besides that, the heart rate monitor buttons are incredibly awkward to use.I give it 2 stars because it is acceptable as a stopwatch and is not too bulky."
3,Mio monitor,"The Mio is an okay heartrate monitor. It works most of the time, but can be temperamental. When it doesn't work right, it makes you wonder how accurate the readings are altogether."
3,Too Much Green Arrow and Lex,I like Green Arrow but not when the stories are focused on him....the same goes for Lex. I don't mind conflict between Clark and Lex but I do not like the conflict to be about Lana. This is where the story took a turn that I couldn't really enjoy. It doesn't make sense for Lana to fall for Lex but she does and the whole series becomes about heartache due to this union rather than just plain conflict between good and evil which Clark and Lex represent. A blind Lana was too much for me to bear.
4,Smallville Season 6,"Everything happens in this season: Phantom Zone villains on the loose, creating a series long retelling of the movie Superman II (or an adaptation of the 1980s 4 issue DC comics mini-series ""Phantom Zone.""As I said in my review for The Batman Season 5, this season of Smallville introduces the Justice League as semi-regular supporting characters, adding one-off guest stars from previous seasons (Cyborg, The Flash, Aquaman) to newcomers Green Arrow and Martian Manhunter.See Lana Lang's plotlines intertwine closely with Lex Luthor's.This is the best of Smallville so far, and the closest we've come to a live action Justice League series.Buy ""The Batman"" season 5 as well, to compare the Justice League intro plotlines."
5,Awesome,It is an awesome Season. Smallville is one of those shows that just gets better with every season. I can not wait till Season 7 comes out!
4,Great video,"The video quality of this blu-ray dvd is excellent. The audio is also pretty good. The only beef I have with the blu-ray season six is that there are no chapter selection in the main menu. You have to use the popup menue to select episode and chapter. Overall, this is a recommended buy for any smallville fan."
5,2 thumbs up,if you ever loved superman than your going to love this series. it is a show about when superman was a boy in high school.
5,smallville is great,I am enjoying watching this series on DVD. I am always busy on Thursdays. It has been great to watch and pick up all the classic references to the superman tradition. The consistent use of primary colors in the set - they haven't forgotten their roots. This is just fun.
3,Slipping fast,I was excited to see the Justice league worked into the story arc.....I must say by the end I was fairly disapointed.....they are loosing the charm of the first four seasons fast.......It really looks like we are fairly close to jumping the shark on this series.
5,Yes...Love It!,"I think this is one of my favorite episodes. This is an epi that has many story lines going on in one episode and yet it all seems to work out. How do they do this? And what's more amazing is that Tom Welling directed this. He's got talent. There are a lot of emotions running thru this epi so those that like character based stories will enjoy this one. A favorite scene of mine is where Lois tries to discover who the Green Arrow is. I don't know how to describe this, I'm not a cinematographer, but the way they filmed those head shots with Lois and Jimmy and Oliver responding to how quickly the Green Arrow left the scene reminds me of an old style movie. I love it! There's another scene that I love but won't give away...it's in the Talon apartments and it's fun to watch. Try it, you'll like it!!!"
4,This Series Used to Be So Much Better,"Not that this isn't good -- a Richard Sharpe story combines, adventure, history, and social commentary in a most enjoyable way. Cornwell is a natural story-teller, and unlike many modern novelists, he doesn't seem intent on making each book longer than the one before.In this one, Sharpe is on a spying mission in Denmark. There are some interesting parts to it -- Sharpe's escape up a chimney is riveting. But the sense of danger just isn't there. The villians aren't menacing; just banal. The consequences seem minor. There are many places where Sharpe could just walk away from the situation.These ""early Sharpe"" books make you appreciate how important the character of Patrikc Harper is to the series."
2,Cornwell's Heart Not in this One.,"To work, historical novels have to have some element of believability. This one just doesn't ! And when the author simply walks away from the ending, one suspects a book is written more to keep the publisher, than the reader, happy."
2,Save your money,"As a social work grad student who needs to follow APA formatting rules for every paper, and there are a lot of them, I was hoping for a brief ""cheat sheet"" to use for those things I seem to always forget. Unfortunately, this particular item is not what I hoped for. The items presented for APA are of little use for my needs. Suspiciously absent are tips for citing and references. This would be a much better product, and far more useful tool, if it was devoted to APA only."
2,APA/MLA guidelines: For undergrads only!,This sheet focuses on grammar and advice to ug researchers rather than the technical details of interest to writers for publication. Disappointing.
2,Thought it was in Spanish or had a Spanish track but it doesn't,I bought this for my bilingual 5 year old daughter becaue I thought it was in Spanish or had a Spanish track but it doesn't so we are quite disappointed.
5,Baby Spanish,This is a great product. The baby learned a few words in a couple of days of watching the DVD.Highly Recommend.
5,"Great Book, it will help you get out of debt!","What was nice about this book is the fact that the author provides step by step instructions on how to organize and reduce your credit card debt. It is very easy to follow, however, if you want the books tricks to work for you, you'll need to have more than one credit card, I had three cards. I especially liked the quotes he provides - what you can tell your creditors so that they lower your interest rates. Oh anf if you are the unorganized type (like me) you will find his charts very very useful, I know I did. Also, the author answered my question within a few days by email. You can't go wrong with this book!"
3,That timeline again!,"What can I say...an excellent transfer. Color, contrast, detail, blacks...all excellent. BUT: it's a Paramount disc. And someone in that company who's responsible for all Paramount's Blu-ray discs, entertains the strange notion that a non-removable, retention-causing timeline that pops up when you touch 'pause' or 'forward' etc., heightens the joy of watching HD.This guy probably does not own a regular Blu-ray player. If he did, he would've known that all players on the consumer's market offer the possibility of showing all kinds of disc info, including a timeline...but only if you WANT them to.So Paramount's non-removable, retention-causing and utterly annoying timeline is also completely superfluous... So why do they do it? Anyone...?"
3,Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy,"A very young Jane Fonda is eye candy in this movie. There is very little plot to it. So, don't expect too much other than entertainment."
2,"if this is what you want , it is ORIGINAL , BUT....","WARNING ; a phenomenally BEAUTIFUL nude Jane Fonda is floating in mid-air shortly as opens ; NOT FAMILY VIEWING by any stretch !! and without a RATING , i didnt know . no sex then , but certainly NOT FAMILY VIEWING . sex is inferred within minutes ; again , i wuznt familiar with this one and i enjoy scifi , so i tried it . OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPS !!to be fair ; Jane is incredibly beautiful , but not MY view of such to be seeing . so , i didnt see the rest and deleted .what i did see , pic quality is excellent reproduction , shipping good , transaction good as uzual .your choice now ."
2,Big disappointment...,"Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman. I watched this as a teenager and despite the ""striptease"" this has to be one of her worst. Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time. If you like Fonda, try Klute. She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess."
3,"Watchable so you can say ""I've seen that""",Not too much to add really . I don't know what i was expecting . I do know i was NOT expecting Sid and Marty Krofft . Really odd . Slightly on the so bad it's good side of the ledger . Some (slightly) fun and funny stuff/folks + female nudity . Marginal .
4,Barbarella Review,"Man movie, corny, cheap sets, corny story lines. Along the lines of Quest for Fire."
2,Not as advertised!,"Shure markets this item as 5 pairs of identical replacement sleeves for the Shure E3c, E3g, E4c, E4g, E5c, I3, I4c, E3c-n and E4c-n model earphones. I own the E4c model, and since I've misplaced enough flex sleeves now so that I no longer had any working pairs, I decided to order this replacement pack. Sure enough, there were 10 clear flex sleeves in the package--but only 3 of them fit my headphones! The other 7 are too large to stay on my headphone nozzles, so they are useless to me. So basically I paid $13 for ONE pair of sleeves plus one spare (which happens to be somewhat useful as I did have one orphaned sleeve remaining from the original pack). Not worth it."
3,What Did You Expect?,"I don't understand all of the negative reviews. With a title like HOT TUB TIME MACHINE, what were you expecting, George Bernard Shaw? It's a low-brow comedy that provides lots of belly laughs if you just take it for what it is--mindless entertainment. Sometimes one needs a good dose, when the world gets a little to serious."
3,An average movie about with a strange concept,"I'll start by saying I'd give this movie 3 stars if Amazon would let me. This movie is a fun escape from reality and does have some good 80's references. However, at less than an hour and a half long and gaps between jokes filled with mostly predictable plot elements, it doesn't live up to it's potential.The good:- Transfer quality is about a 4/5. Most elements of the movie pop and no noticeable grain. Colors are vibrant.- Good acting all around - especially Cusak- Has some nudity and some of the jokes hit pretty wellThe bad- Too short! While not the most enjoyable film I feel that maybe there was more that could have stayed but was cut- Besides the entire premise of a hot tub time machine being unrealistic, the plot takes some other turns that don't make sense. One character's wife cheated on him but yet he doesn't want to cheat on her back.Overall a good experience I'd rent but not need to own for more than maybe 8 bucks"
3,Hot Tub Time Machine,"The only reason worth watching is Craig Robinson,John Cusack(I've never liked him) truly bombs in this and then you have another stinkbomb like chevy chubby chaser in it.The premise is beyond dumb and despite a cameo from Thomas Lennon(Reno 911) and some shock value moments and of course a jab at Reagan(Cusack ""the 80's We Had Reagan...""),plenty of boobage too.It really isn't the funny as a whole,I must admit I do like the Motley Lue and Lueggle though."
5,No Oscars for the greatest movie of 2010?,"Damn the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for not recognizing this film in 2010. If you grew up in the 1980s as I did and have seen this movie, then you know the Oscars is nothing but a sham of a farce of a ceremony for self-congratulatory dilettantes who wouldn't know art if their agents didn't point it out for them! For shame, Oscar!"
1,Beyond boring,"If you like to hear the F word 5,000 times an hour, want to watch guys barf all over each other, and love pre-adolescent toilet humor, this is the flick for you. I hated it. I cannot believe an actor like John Cusack was willing to take any role in such a substandard, schlocky movie. Not even remotely funny or entertaining, just gross. I was not expecting this to be a five-star movie, but I thought it would at least be fun to watch. I was hugely disappointed. Would not watch this again under any circumstances."
1,One FATAL flaw - it's not funny,"It's not funny at all. We sat there straight-faced throughout the whole movie waiting for something funny to happen. Poor John Cusack must be having financial difficulties or something. We have already laughed at all the body fluid jokes - so they are not funny anymore, just desperate. This whole movie is desperate. Anyway, this has to be a new low in what gets marketed as a comedy these days. Sad, sad, sad."
1,Waaaay Below Expectations!,"Unlike some other folks, I really wanted to LIKE this movie, especially after strong word of mouth and many good reviews when it first came out. Unfortunately, the film is extremely disappointing. Keep in mind that some of my all-time favorite comedy films are GHOSTBUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, MEET THE PARENTS, 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, ANIMAL HOUSE, BLUES BROTHERS, ANNIE HALL, IT'S A MAD MAD...WORLD. Recently, I loved THE HANGOVER, which leads this revitalized genre of group bromance comedies. This HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is utter nonsense, from beginning to end, and I warn you not to waste your time or money on it. Flimsy script, poor direction, poor pacing, forced sex humor (for juveniles)"
1,A New Low for John Cusack,"John Cusack once had talent and a promising career. Now he not only stars in, but apparently also produced, this appallingly stupid, vulgar, and unfunny time-travel comedy.You know you're in for a long ninety minutes when you get one dog poop and one human piss joke in the first five minutes. And that's about the height of the hilarity on display here.Really -- if you like bodily excretions -- or you're almost horizontally drunk -- you might enjoy this horribly acted, written, and directed film.Everyone else with an ounce of intelligence, taste, or sobriety should steer far clear.This is truly one of the worst so-called comedies I've ever seen. I paid a buck to rent this film from Redbox for one night -- and I still feel cheated.Other famous whores on display here include Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover. I feel sorry for the lot of them, but not as sorry as I feel for anyone who finds anything to laugh at here. A wretched waste of celluloid -- and time."
1,The worst piece of s*** I have ever seen...period.,"There is no reason to like or care about any of the principal characters in this movie, one (Rob Corddry) was just plain unwatchable. The fact that it gets more than one star from anyone here just tells me the sad state of what the moviegoing public has come to expect out of their hard-earned money, and even sadder is the fact that people who make a lot more than you or me will continue to churn this kind of crap out. If Amazon had a ""negative"" star rating, I'd max it out for this dreck. Avoid at all costs. You won't get those two hours of your life back, ever. After 2012, now this, it should be evident that Cusack is in it for the bucks, and nothing more."
1,Not Funny,"If your IQ is below 40, this film might be funny but for everyone else, sorry Mr Cusack, not even ""tee hee...."" funny"
3,It's OK,I am slightly disappointed as there are not to many songs that kids can sing along too...Opera and blues are not kids friendlyIts ok Something different to mix it up a bit ....Not very educational they dont focus on letters or numbers much
1,Good movie if your teenage years were really lame,"If you were one of those teens who wasted their entire teen social life hanging around empty parking lots trying to act like you knew what you were doing with a skateboard, like ol Booger from Columbus Ga did, this movie is for you. It shows what a lame social life these dweebs had, you know, the ones who could not make any sports teams in high school, were not real smart and didn't do their schoolwork, and who had nothing else going for them except hanging around McDonald's and the mall. Where did all that skateboarding get ya? This movie documents that wasted teen life that becomes the adult life of a Booger."
5,"TOTALLY AWESOME RIPPIN' FROM THE OLD SCHOOL, ORIGINAL DOG TOWN SKATER FLICK FROM THE 80'S!","IF you're into skateboarding at all, then this video is a must-have for your collection! It features Tony Alva, Christian Hosoi, Stev(i)e Caballero, Rodney Mullen (best freestyle skater EVER, I.M.O.),Tony Magnussen, & even Tony Hawk! This film from 1986 is a pinacle of the skateboarding era, stemming from one of the most notorious skate spots in the U.S., some say from where skateboarding originated, in Venice Beach, CA, A.K.A. ""Dog Town"". There are scenes in the film showing all varieties of skateboarding, including ramp (vert), street & even downhill. The love story that comes along with all the shredding is sort of cheesy, but is still worth the watch for all of the action. If you haven't seen this movie, it's a must! Especially if you're into the 80's movies OR skateboarding!"
2,How to Fix Wild Mood Swings,"The real shame of this album is that Robert Smith left the best cuts off for B-sides. Any Cure fan worth their salt should seek out all the B-sides for the singles (Adonais, It Used To Be Me, Ocean, A Pink Dream, Home, etc.) and record your own version, replacing all the hopelessly noxious pieces (Round and Round, Numb, etc.) with the B-sides. What Bob was thinking when he left these off I haven't a clue - Ocean and It Used To Be Me are absolute masterpieces, and would have fit in with the theme of the album much better (just where are the mood swings, anyway?). With the B-sides, it's four-star, without two-star. Too bad he couldn't take a mulligan on this one and start over."
2,"The first below-par Cure album (9 out of 10 ain't bad, tho)","To me, this album marked the beginning of the end of an all-out Cure fandom that had lasted for seven years. A few great songs, but on the whole unmoving, indulgent, and bland. The good ones are ""Want"" (predictable and uninspired lyrics, but an effective opener in the vein of ""The Kiss"" or ""Open""), ""The 13th"" (a brilliantly successful experiment a la ""LoveCats"" or ""Caterpillar""), ""Club America"" (a becomingly forceful and spry anthem), ""Mint Car"" (too catchy for words), and ""Jupiter Crash"" and ""Treasure"", which have a nice atmosphere that I can't quite describe. 'Moody' songs like ""This Is A Lie"", ""Numb"", and ""Bare"", however, just lie flat and quivering no matter how many times you try to listen to them and hear something special there. The superbly sequenced _Wish_ was apparently their last hurrah, unfortunately, but I guess they had to go so! ! ft eventually..."
4,the only Cure album EVER,"Okay, yeah, this is the only Cure album EVER to have a weak track. Therefor, I cannot, in all good morality, give it the full five stars. However, the good tracks make it all well worth buying. Jeepers, if you're a Cure fan, you're in dire need of this album. First off, you sit there and tell me you don't absolutely love ""Jupiter Crash"". It's magnificent. Second of all, you're a human being and a Cure fan. Robert Smith lamenting that he wants ""more head"" totally rules. That goes for the other heap of blatant, ambiguity-free naughty bits in the album. At one point he actually sings clearly about rubber fetishes. And strippers. (...) You can't look me in the eye and tell me that's not tempting. Buy it. Don't listen to the nonbelievers. They simply don't understand..."
4,Pretty Good Not Fantastic,"""Muses on the Move"" is the third installment of this four part series.Thalia, her sisters, and a weird classmate with a strange mohawk are setting out on the road this Thanksgiving. Their plan is to see a few places and have fun. But Thalia has something else in the back of her mind: Dylan from Denver.In her attempts to quickly get to him, she ends up breaking the rule of not being allowed to use her powers. They cause mayhem where ever they go. Dog-like alligators, disappearing parades, and Pocky, the classmate is getting closer and closer to discovering thei secret.Apollo, Thalia's love is out looking for them, too. But he never seems to catch them at the right times.I thought it was a pretty good book. But nothing to sit around, raving about. And people have different opinions. You might really love this book. Read to see what happens."
3,"Same as last year, but still fun...","FIFA 2008 PC is no different from FIFA 2007, except for the updated players and teams for the 2008 season. The gameplay is actually slightly worse in regards to switching players. The difference in difficulty from amateur to semi-pro is like going from highschool to the MLS!!! Not quite on target...There are some exciting new players to choose from like Lulinha and Bojan, but don't bother buying this if you already have FIFA 2007...I would wait till 2009 is out."
5,There's A Dead Cat On The Line!,"I found out about Rev. Gates because Steve Cushing would typically play one of Gates' sermons during his radio program's ""gospel set."" Gates was the most popular producer of the ""singing and sermon"" records issued during the 20's. Gates tended more towards the sermon side and they are quite bizarre to the contemporary ear to say the least! The most interesting tracks are the one I mentioned in the title of the review and ""No Room in the Jailhouse."" I would recommend starting with this disc first and working your way backwards through the series as there are a lot of reissues of the same sermons in his earlier releases. Gates' style is also fully developed on the later discs. You mother heart breakers! You midnight ramblers!"
5,A lost memory comes back home,"My sister and I had this book when we were kids. I was so happy to see that there are still copies in existence. I ordered this book for my niece and it arrived in record time and excellent condition as advertised. The funny thing is that my mother and the seller have the same name. The most shocking moment was when I opened the book and saw a faint, penciled name that had been erased and it happened to be my sister's name! This is the exact book that my mom read to us when we were children. This book has traveled from Portland, Oregon, to SW Montana, only to come back to us in Happy Valley, Oregon. What are the chances. My sister, niece, and mother will be so shocked and elated hearing this tale. Thank you for selling this gem, we're happy to have it back!"
4,Loved this book!,"This book was an excellent read. Walton had an incredible level of access and shared amazingly close details about the multi-year process of developing the redesign of the Taurus and Sable. It was actually a page-turner! I am an admitted ""car nut"" but I also read business books frequently and this book gave me a good shot of both. I actually wish there were more chapters (it's over 300 pages), because there were some bits left out. But I'd recommend this book highly - it gives the reader a much better appreciation for what goes into making a new model of a high-volume car and it's an entertaining read for anyone interested in business and the personalities that make-up an American corporation."
3,only one,"only one out there for now and required, but it leaves a lot of gaps, especially in a&p. overall good text, but will not be sufficient by itself if you truly want to understand."
5,Great Reference,"Great reference. Helps with the transition from street to critical care paramedic. The chapter on airway management was excellent diving into the difficult airway and how to best approach it. Very in depth chapter on pharmacology and references in the system chapters adout the drugs used for each problem. Each chapter has review questions, they really help the information to stick. Overall a great buy, should have purchaced it sooner."
1,a miss,"the earrings are very unsubstantial, and do not glisten as shown on picture, anyone want to buy my pair?would send cheap."
2,just ok,couldn't watch it all. watched episode one with was really episode 2 so when i watched episode 2 it only slowed down the story as i figured most of it out because they gave the basic info in episode 1. couldn't watch it after i found out how the transformation occured.
5,No such thing as bad,"Live from Austin, TX '84This beautiful man with the endlessly remarkable voice delivers such greats you gotta wonder how he ever felt he needed any drugs to shore himself up. Really wish he were here to keep on soaring and making the world such a happier place."
1,"horrible, triffling and shallow and dreadful!",I would request my money back if I could. After becoming an L. Sanders fan through the McNally series I was excited about venturing into his latest...I was profoundly disappointed and threw it into the trash upon completion. I honestly believe if I ever recommend this book to anyone and they actually tried to read it they would never speak to me again.
1,Disappointing.,"This book was dark, depressing, and boring. I couldn't believe it was a L. Sanders book. I kept reading only in the belief that it had to get better. It didn't."
1,banal and disappointing,"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I usually donate books that I have finished and enjoyed to the library. I'm embarrassed to give them this one. No plot, no character development. It seems Sanders is living on his reputation--too bad."
1,Revolting,"There are alot of odd families in this world. Alot of odd families with secrets. However this book was disgusting. This book is just like those comic books, movies, or television shows that have extreme nudity and violence just so they can shock people. You can add this book to that list.I threw away this book after reading the first couple of chapters.Do not buy this book!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Sub-Par Swan Song,"To Sanders fans and casual readers, this novel is a major disappointment. Still, I must admit to some amusement at the intensity with which other reviewers here are attacking this weak effort. It should be noted that this novel was published just after Sanders' death, and it is possible that he intended to work on it more but was prevented from doing so by ill health. Alternately it's conceivable that his declining health may have kept him from tapping some of his usually delicious ideas and left him with a potboiler that rarely bubbles. The Sanders style is here, but muted. A final McNally novel is scheduled for this summer, so let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that this one is closer to Sanders' usual standard. As for all those folks who exclaim that they won't read another one --- well, this is the last one. Too bad he couldn't have departed on a more graceful note."
5,Live on the fabulous Sunset Strip,"One of the best live rock albums. Having the fortune of seeing X a decade after-the-fact (sometime in 2000 at the Axis in Boston), I can say that they rocked just as hard as this album. Billy Zoom with his splay-legged stance and ... grin. DJ Bonebrake crashing the heads. Exene and John Doe belting out the punkabilly pop gems. The only complaint is that the original cassette release contained one of the finest live cuts that is NOT included (Someone tell me why) on the CD - True Love. But that is hardly enough to keep me from recommending this to anyone."
5,X - 'Live At The Whiskey A Go-Go' (Elektra),"'Live At...' was recorded while the band was out on tour in 1988,with additional guitarist Tony Gilkyson.So,now X was a five piece.No complaint here.Total of 21 songs performed in 72 minutes of up-beat all American home grown old-school punk.Very good choice.Recently,I got to see all four original members reunite for a decent length tour.Which was:Exene Cervenka-vocals,D.J.Bonebrake-drums,John Doe-bass and Billy Zoom-guitar.These 'new wave' era punksters STILL put on a great live performance.They did many of the tracks on this live CD,like ""Los Angeles"",""Burning House Of Love"",""My Goodness"",""Devil Doll"",""Hungry Wolf"",""Riding With Mary""(my favorite X song),""White Girl"" and ""Johnny Hit"".A nice find."
4,Lightweight but well engineered,"This table took two adults four hours to assemble. A socket wrench is a must. Because playing surface material is thin, special emphasis is needed to ensure that table is level. This is not a table that will take a lot of abuse as its frame is of light construction and will not bear a lot of side to side or downward pressure or leaning. The table was otherwise as advertised and it has a great look. Courteous and prompt delivery with super saver shipping option."
4,Great fun,"This purchase was well worth it. My family and I have had many hours of fun. It made our summer, playing by the pool."
1,Try Overstock.com Auctions!,"Anyone with the least bit of PC knowledge and customer service skills can sell on any on-line venue. Most have it set up to walk you through step by step. Besides, eBay raised their fees so high as of 2/18/05 that many sellers are flocking to other venues like www.overstock.com/auctions!"
3,Good Introduction to Ebay,I wanted to explore the possibility of starting an Ebay business and this book provided me with answers to most of my questions.Covers many aspects of Ebay business process but I was expecting more information on finding sources of products to sell.
1,One-sided story,"In this story, the reader is led to be sympathetic with Edward and his family, who are fearful they will be killed by Indians. Nowhere is there a hint that the Indian people were fighting to protect their own homes and their own families. They are merely shown as vicious savages. Balanced stories of this period of history must be read to children. This one is far from balanced, and I'm sad to see it is still being reprinted."
4,big gun worlds best review,"It is a good book for yong children. It is about a boy who is very intersted in a gun that hangs above the mantle . It is huge gun that is longer than a full grown man.The best the thing about The Match Lock Gun is it is very short and very easy to read. It is an interesting book. I also, liked the fact there was never a dull moment.I didn't like that it was over before it ever started. I also, didn't like that it was unrealistic. It was a decent book and I would read it because it is not very time consuming."
2,Respect their feelings,"The Matchlock Gun is an okay story and it has lots of action. But, I agree that it is one-sided. The Indians have a family and a land to protect just like us. It isn't like we have never done the exact same thing. We should respect their feelings too. They have the right to fight back and protect their people."
3,"action, drama, suspense","This book isn't the greatest book I have ever read but it does have plenty of action, drama and sacrifice. I do believe that this book should recommend more of the Indian's point of view rather than have them as the villains of the story. I also rate this book 3 stars because it didn't have anything about the mother living or dying, and it doesn't say if there were anymore Indians or not"
3,Worth It For The Music,"This movie is very funny in places. I like how Virgina O'Brien is the aggressor and takes on the man's roll in her relationship with Red Skelton. She shines in the musical number (Solome). The Cole Porter music is great. (Friendship) is definatly the highlight of the movie. Virginia's voice Cadences are astounding. Lucille Ball looks fabulous in technicolor(especially her hair). If you love fabulous forty's glamour girls than you will adore the (Lovely Girls) number. I wish they would of resolved the Virgina and Red relationship more, but I guess they only had so much film. I also wish that Gene Kelly had more than one dance number."
4,Listen to disc 2 first.,"I listened to this album when I was driving across America, and when I listen to it now I still see deserts with skies full of little clouds (yeah, the Orb, right) and in particular I see the Grand Canyon. BT makes Tori Amos' voice do what it could never possibly do, what no human could make their voice do. It's embellished, extended, made so unbelievably beautiful. It takes flight and you soar right after it. On the down side, I definitely prefer the second disc to the first. I don't care much for the first and rarely listen to it. Also, I've heard the albums BT's done since then and don't like them one bit. IMA is the best he has yet to do."
3,Doesn't quite look like that...,"I like it, but its smaller than it seems. It's also not shiny as pictured. It's matte black and unremarkable-looking."
5,Best Effort From an Excellent Band,"Without a doubt, Blow Your Cool is the one of the best CD's the Hoodoo Gurus put out. It has a raw sound that backed by solid vocals and lyrics. Unlike some of their later CD's that felt disjointed, the song writing on Blow Your Cool holds together like a band at their zenith. If you get just one Hoodoo Gurus CD, make this one it."
5,One of the best band around.,"The Hoodoo Gurus are without a doubt one of the best bands aroud still to this day. This album is probably the best one but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The work is fun,sweet,smart,sometimes sad,darkly funny but always well worth it."
3,Pros & Cons,"They are very nice and I have gotten compliments. However, I like to be able to put them in and forget about them but they catch hair and are too bulky to sleep in w/out waking you because they're digging in. It also says you can add your own beads but the contour of the spiral won't allow an elegant small one. You'd have to add a very large bead that would just be too much for the dainty look of the earring. So far they don't irritate my sensitive ears and that's a big plus! Overall, they're pretty and interesting but a bit expensive."
4,"Interesting, smart and in the end, a bit confusing","It's an interesting read; the philosophical musings and references to philosophers took me back to Philosophy 101 in college. It reminded me of ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" the film by Woody Allen, wherein each character represents a philosopher (the blind Rabbi is Aquinus 'the eyes of god'), and this book is similar. I tried to figure out which philosopher was represented by each character, and how the interaction propelled the protagonist. The plot is fast paced and flows well. The use of poetry is not facetious; it enhances the story. I enjoyed it, although I may be admitting my ignorance by saying I didn't really ""get"" the ending."
1,Ack!,"Just for fun I decided to go through my CD archive and find the worst one in the bunch and review it. Congrats, Bjork, this is the winner! I'm a huge fan of good alternative/eclectic pop, such as XTC in their heyday and the B-52's, but I never got this one at all despite several listenings to make a serious attempt. Weird weird weird weird...which can be great as with the B's... but here totally lacking in intelligence, wit, or memorable hooks. Was it me?"
2,Slower Processors Beware!,"Although my G3 266MHz meets the minimum system requirements on speed, I was a little shy on memory so increased my virtual memory as recommended. However, even then the game was extremely sluggish and slow to the point of crawling. It was pretty much impossible to play with my current computer configuration. If you would like to add this one to your collection, be sure your system meets at least the RECOMMENDED specs, not the minimum and you should have loads of fun."
2,the complete pyrography,"I found the book very hard to read.It seemed to be geared more toward the art in england and more helpful if you were to attend his classes.However there was some very good information and gives the student alot of freedom to branch out with thier own style,but for someone completly new to the art of pyrography I needed more step by step illustrations and helpful hints.All in all the book made me want to strive for more of an artistic result in my work.This book could be helpful but not the only book you need if you are starting out or trying to learn this on your own."
2,Double means Concentrate,"I have used the regular Polo Black to great delight, so I thought ""Double Black"" meant double the fun, an upgrade. Wrong. It is too strong, a choking loud smell. I like aqua gentle perfumes, the regular black is great but I won't recommend this unless you like strong perfumes."
5,Rome for the connoisseur of life,"This book succeeds in revealing the soul of the Eternal City called Rome. Choose a neighborhood from the introductory map and then read the suggestions for sites, restaurants and stores eloquently descibed for the location.I found new appreciation for obsure piazzos as well as famous sites. The collections of opinions gathered in this book helped me to see Rome as as Architect, Painter, Archeologist as well as the Landscape Architect that I am. I look forward to future additions about some of my other favorite cities."
4,Great for babies with weight gain issues,My little girl has always been in the 5 percentile and it's very important to keep her caloric intake up. This assists tremendously with that even when she is sick or just doesn't feel like eating.
5,This cd is great,"This cd is great! The group rocks. If you like the sugarcubes, try listening to bj√∂rk's music some time."
4,Pow Wow Music,Love the old-time sound of the pow wow music and other songs on this disc. Received it soon than expected. Thank you.
3,first wonderful book of cute boys,"That was the first book and the beginning from that german photographer in 1997. Many pictures have that ""riefenstahl""and typical german look.Now - i have all 4 books from Kingdome19 and he is a great one.Sadly, the book is a little bit small and has only 48 pages.But the boys are very, very cute and well hung.If you need more, look for his 2nd book: 2Omen with over 100."
2,Great animation......wasted,Eva was a great series but in the end i appears as though everything was sacraficed for character developement. The plot is full of holes and left relatively unresolved. If you enjoy character developement then this last volume should give you a smile but if you were expecting the conclusion of this story then you will be very angry. Eva was a good series with lots of potential but it focused too much on character development and forgot about everything else......what could have been......
3,Only one good episode,"I'm giving this DVD 3 stars because of the three episodes on the disc, only the first is good. The last two episodes were the original ending to the series, which were confusing and just plain stupid. They didn't do justice to the series. No wonder the fans in Japan demanded another ending be made. Still waiting for Death/Rebirth & End of Evangelion to come out on domestic DVD."
1,Bad,The last 2 episodes are the worst. Some say it is good but I think it the worst episodes in any anime I ever saw. Therefore I am waiting for the movie to come and It is a great anime but some of the episodes in the anime takes 1 star as for the last 2 episodes.
2,not good for Identifying birds quickly,this book tells you where to find birds but does not really help identify them. It is great for planning a birding trip but you need another book for identifying the birds you see quickly.
3,Hit and Miss,"This book will surely enlighten those that want to learn more about Andrew Jackson. It does however glaze over a few of the mans more notorious deeds. There was barely a page devoted to the forced relocation of the Cherrokee and other tribes of indians that lived East of the Missippi. Today this would have been a crime against humanity and it led to the Trail of Tears which is one of the more humiliating parts of American history. Nothing at all was mentioned of the fact that this was done with the Supreme Court saying that such an action was unacceptable. The subject of the closure of the National Banks could have done with some more discussion as well. The book did give the reader a bit of a look into the ""What was he thinking?"" question that most modern minds are led to ask when thinking of some of the actions of Gen. Jackson.It's shortcomings aside, I am glad to have read it as it is a good look into an all too often forgotten time of American history."
3,The CD case is broken.,"When I received the parcel, I found the CD case was broken becasue the CD was not well packed by plastic bubble paper."
5,"""I'm a Stoneage Romeo, I got a Spaceage Juliet....""","""...We'll take guitars to Mars and hit the discotheque... c'mon!"" --- outrageous, funky, hip, warped, grand slammin rock n' roll. The crazy days when the Gurus were submerged in hair, paisley headbands and grunge. Just as legendary as the previous Stoneage Romeos, the Gurus just kept on pumping out great music. Like Wow Wipeout is a cult-like anthem for those who grew up with the Gurus. This whole album, again, is another non-stop quality Gurus masterpiece! And Dave Faulkner's hair back then, what a look Dave. (To add to the legend, the Gurus are died-in-the-wool fans of rugby league team Cronulla; Go you Sharks!)"
2,Nice content but jumpy picture,I enjoyed the content and music but the video is quite jumpy when any motion is depicted. Haven't seen anything like this since the very early days of DVD so I'm not sure if I got a bad copy or if it's something in the production of the video or manufacturing. I guess I will return to the Earthscapes series.
2,Beware: Moleskine has darkened its lines,"This advice applies both to the lined and the squared notebooks: Moleskine has recently changed the inking on the rules to darken them considerably. I have a shelf of Moleskine notebooks stretching back to 2002, and for the first time in a decade, I find I have to buy a different notebook. I work a lot with a pencil, and the darkened rules now compete visually with pencil lines. But I also find them distracting with blue inks and fine lines. I will, when I have a moment, post a photo showing the difference between the two line colors: it is rather dramatic. For now I am using another brand of black notebook -- I don't think it's fair to mention their name -- which has retained the faintness of line that Moleskine used to possess. Still, I must admit that I have become so accustomed the size and shape of Moleskines that the added width of the new notebook continually throw me off: it doesn't fit in certain coat pockets."
2,Very cute but not worth the purchase price,"Well, if you can find this for $2 or less, it may be worth it. The ""shorts""--which you can hardly call ""mini-movies"" are cute and entertaining--BUT ALL THREE mini-movies TOGETHER run about a total of 12 minutes! I happened to find this at the grocery store for $6.99--and yes, I snatched it up without looking at the running time. It does say on the back in about 4 pt. font size that the running time is 12 minutes, but had I seen that, I would have assumed they meant each mini-movie was 12 minutes in length. My six year old daughter and three year old boy both love Despicable Me, (and so do I), so I only feel mildly ripped off... lol... we'll enjoy this, but usually if I'm putting on a DVD I expect to be able to sit back and relax for a while."
5,Love the minions,"I only wish there was more, there are 3 short videos, my daughter loves all of them. I just wish it was more than 15 minutes total"
3,Too short,The mini-movies were great but only lasted 4 minutes each! The interactive games were the only thing that saved this purchase. Even for $5.00 12 minutes of video was way too short.
5,Mad,If you remember the Madchester scene you probably weren't there. Get this and lets the memories live
3,Bible,I am only giving it 3 stars because it took so long to receive it.I have not seen the product. It was a gift for a friend and he is very happy with it now that he finally has it.Thanks.
4,"NIV Holy Bible, Compact","Print is too small for me to read, even with reading glasses. I will probably try to find a larger print edition, and just give this as a gift. Otherwise, great puchase."
5,Holy Bible niv,I use the niv as well as the new king James and like both of them. I really prefer for each verse to be listed seperately but it is okay like it is.
2,Large Print?,"I was disappointed with this Bible for one reason. I specifically purchased it based on the clearly advertised "" Large Print"". If you are looking for a Bible with Large Print I would clearly advise you against it."
3,Just Fair,I found that trying to look up a scripture was too time consuming. I finally resorted to just using my written NIV Bible to find what I was looking for. I hope this is helpful to someone. Charles D. King :)
2,Hard to navigate,"This Bible is difficult to navigate, Therer are no helps concordance or other extras to assist. I thought it would be a quick easy way to access texts. It's easier to look up scripture in a hard copy."
1,Interesting,"I received my Kindle DX one week ago and the first thing I wanted to download was the NIV Bible. I had read all of the reviews and decided that it was indeed good. Well, it says it is not available yet. Now my question is 'how can people have it and review it if it is now available'? Just found this interesting!"
5,Holy Bible,I really love this Bible! It is easy to read and I can take it everywhere because of my Kindle.
2,NIV at best OK.,"I have a non-Kindle tablet and am very disappointed in the lack of features available in the Kindle reader available to us. Things like ability to search easily are key and seem to be missing. This makes the experience of using the NIV Bible less enjoyable. The proprietary format is annoying. I have a GNU reader that is feature packed and cannot use it. I suspect this will be my first and last book from Amazon.I downloaded a free version from an app store that is much better laid out, easier to use and has many more features than this version."
4,Kindle Bible is wonderful,I love reading the Bible on Kindle. I tend to read it longer than I otherwise would since I don't have to think about how very long it is. It is easy to navigate and Kindle's bookmarking feature works wonders on a Bible.
5,The Best Kindle Bible So Far,This is the only Kindle Bible I have found (including free Bibles from non Amazon sources) which has a full table of contents. Each Book is easily accessed from the TOC and there is a clickable numeric list of chapters in each book when you open it.I don't understand how T.Heyn could have misread this. Maybe he had an earlier Kindle version which has since been updated.I can find John 3:16 or any other verse in this Bible in just a few seconds. Buy this one and you will not be disappointed.
3,NIV Bible for the Kindle,"The NIV Bible for the Kindle is good reading of course but searching for a particular verse is hard to do. It will lead you to the Old and New Testament ok and to the particular Chapter but not the verses - say if you want to go to Genesis 1:15 it will bring you to Genesis 1 but then you have to go page by page to get to 15 - ugh! Other than that, it's great reading! The TNIV Bible for the Kindle is much better for finding your Chapters and Verses - You can get to exactly what you want by the menus."
3,Know Your Bibles,"Most denominations have a translation of the bible that works best for their faith. It is important to note that different translations take on different meanings to the people who read them. Ever wonder how there can be so much variation in one religion? Translation is a big factor. Here is a list of translations along with the denomination that commonly uses itCatholics-- NAS, JerusalemLiberal Christians (Episcopal, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, ELCA Lutheran) -- NRSV, CEV, Good News (TEV)Conservative Christians (Baptist, Evangelical, Mormon, Wisconsin and Missouri Lutheran) -- King James, NIV"
4,There's No Such Thing As Bad Noir,"Well, maybe mediocre noir with occasional shafts of lightning. I liked THE GRIFTERS better."
4,Pretty good,"I really liked this book. It started off a little slow, but I really enjoyed the ending. Can't wait to read the sequel."
4,Not Bad for a First Time,"I liked this book a lot. I think that for a first book, she did the damn thing! The plot didn't drag and the dialogue was realistic. I like that the characters said and did things that I would do. Shonda Cheeks also managed to create a plot that you don't see everyday, and that was good too. I'm looking forward to her next book."
4,Entertaining!,"I couldn't put the book down. It was full of suspense, drama and let's not forget romance. As I read, I wanted to know if, where, and when Jarrin was coming back and waiting for the outcome was well worth the wait."
5,The best live heavy metal album ever made.,"UNLEASHED IN THE EAST is true JUDAS PRIEST. I first saw JUDAS PRIEST live when they played their first show ever in the U.S. opening for LED ZEPPELIN and RICK DERRINGER at a day on the green in Oakland, Ca. in 1976. I had never heard of them before, but I was blown away by them. I have seen them five times since then, and every show is very memorable. UNLEASHED IN THE EAST is a perfect example of what JUDAS PRIEST is like live. They are true metal gods. UNLEASHED IN THE EAST captures the best of ROB HALFORD, K.K. DOWNING , AND GLEN TIPTON. ROB HALFORDS vocals are in legendary form on this album. This is a must have for any fan of heavy metal, and heavy it is. There are other great live albums in other genres of music, but for heavy metal, this is in my opinion the best. A must have for every metal fan."
5,True Power,This is the greatest live recording ever produced by a metal outfit. No other recording will ever top it. Get it. Enjoy.
5,marshall stacks,"as far as i know, this was the first album that was unrelenting metal from first song to last. no artsy stuff, no mood pieces, just pounding metal all the way through. want to hear early priest at their best, here it is."
5,Seems the best of the bass books I have looked at or owned,"The Dummies books are highly variable in quality. This is a good one. It teaches four frets per position, if that makes a difference."
4,GREAT BOOK,BOOK AND CD ARE A GREAT LEARNING TOOL BOTH WERE VERY GOOD.I RECOMEND IT FOR ANYONE JUST STARTING OUT LEARNING BASS GUITAR.
3,Good but not great,"This book is a worthwhile resource, but it's pretty shallow with a lot of its explanations. What I liked least about this book was it's focus on the 4 finger technique (everything is charted with the assumption that you can cover 4 frets with 4 fingers). I have small to medium hands and this technique does work for me without serious strain. The book does not explain how to pivot for fret coverage or offer alternative techniques such as the 1-2-4 (Four fingers covering three frets instead of four). For a beginner, it might be easy to conlude that the bass isn't for them when they end up struggling with the 4-finger technique. The Hal Leonard series does a much better job of explaining different techniques and alternatives and is a superior learning resource for beginners."
5,Bass Guitar For Dummies,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! So thorough that after 20+ years of playing the bass, this book strengthened and fortified my bass playing.Thank You, Mr. Pfeiffer!!!!!Michael Yorky"
5,Best bass book i've read,"This is a great book to get if you're just starting to play, or even if you're more advanced. It goes step by step in very concise, simple lessons. Even if you get stuck or don't understand something the people at Dummies are extremely supportive.To give an example, I was stuck in one part of the book or didn't exactly get something, and I e-mailed customer support at Dummies. They must have got in contact with Patrick Pfeiffer (the author of the book) and he actually called me on my cell phone and explained everything to me! It's one of the nicest things anyone has done for me and I was quite blown away by it. So if you think you'll have an interest in playing bass, I would not hesitate to buy this book."
5,Fun learning,"I got the math and the word versions for my 30-month-old daughter. She knows her numbers up to 20 and all of her letters. These puzzles built on that knowledge by helping her understand the concepts of addition, subtraction, and putting letters together to make words. The puzzles won't go together if the pieces don't match, so she gets instant feedback that she needs to try another number (or letter, in the case of the word version). Great scaffolding toys."
2,Went through 4 pkgs in 2 years,"These tub treads are great at first - but then over time they lift away and must be replaced. We went through 4 pkgs in 2 years and yet I found myself needing to shop for more. That's when I found the Slip Doctor tub treatment. If you are seeking a non-slip treatment for a porcelain surface such as a tub, I highly recommend consideringBathtub Non Slip Shower Safety Treatment Kitinstead."
5,Amazing <3,First anime I really really watched and I had to own it the lovey stuff is amazing but over all a cheesy anime but that's ok with me
4,Northern England's misery produces fine music once again..,"I used to walk through my local music store, picking out one CD at random and buying it. Pooka was the bullet in my game of roulette. With breathy, almost disturbing harmonies, these two girls from Manchester show once again that while rainy weather may tend to be depressing, it certainly can inspire one to produce incredible music."
3,dated but useful,"The information in the book is dated but just because it is dated the biology of beer making hasn't changed in a gazillion years. Mr Miller stresses the most important ingredient in home brewing: sanitation. I also read ""The Practical Distiller"" by McHarry which was written 200 years before this and McHarry stresses the same thing: sanitation. hmmm, they might be on to something. :-)"
2,the anonymous venetian,It is a good story; and it is a terrible shame that is was in GERMAN! WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.WHO WANTS TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT VENICE IN GERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A Hell on Earth,"I admit that I'm not much of a reader of historical fiction because authors kind of always make the past seem so much more superior to the present. THE FIVE POINTS is a very detached look at the poverty of a New York town in the 1800s. Although some of the characters seem two dimensional, the key characters come off as being very rounded out and intriguing. The pacing is fast most of the time, and very deliberate when it needs it. I really enjoyed this book and already lent it to two friends."
1,Drunken master IS great........ but this version IS NOT!,"GAH! I bought this on zshops..... man was I dissapointed! Rumble in hong kong i did not even bother watching; i bought this for DM! Imagine my surprise.... Drunken master was subtitled. Not that I have a problem with reading dialogue, but.... It was subtitled with chinese text on the top, and with the english cut off at the sides and on the bottom! Some words are visable, but 99% are not. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS POOR COPY"
2,Useful pocket book for revision,"I didn't expect too much from this book, having seen other bad reviews. I paid $10.00 for my copy. For me the main advantage is the books small size , which makes it useful to leave in my pocket and use to revise basic korean expressions from time to time (while waiting for street cars, for example).The subtitle, ""How to express 1,000 different ideas with just 100 key words and phrases!"" is just misdirection. The book is organised into 100 sections, each of which contains at least 5 or six PHRASES and additionally vocabulary with some 10 to 20 words to learn. I made that well over 1,000 words and phrases with which to express around 1,000 ideas.There is no organisation in this book that would help anyone to begine learning Korean, but as an ""additional resource"" it is useful."
2,Not Harry Potter - Modesitt on downers!,"Publishers Weekly described Enemy Glory as ""a sort of Harry Potter on downers"". It comes endorsed by heavyweights such as Samuel R. Delaney and is promoted as ""a new fantasy saga in the dramatic tradition of George R. R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES"". However, given the plotline, I'd describe it as ""Modesitt on downers"", rather than making any comparison to George R. R. Martin in any way!ENEMY GLORY has taken me at least a month to read - it's one of those books which, when you take it up, you soon find yourself putting it down again, and picking up the local paper or the TV listings magazine. Either that, or you're forever flicking forward to see if it looks like it'll improve.I'm surprised at myself that I finished it. Avoid."
1,Boring,"I disagree that this is well written or somehow superior fantasy. It is narcissistic; the author has NO idea how to write in the first person, blathering from moment to moment until it made my teeth ache. Llewelyn [now THERE's an unusual fantasy name] is a grating character, and not deep enough to warrant following so closely. I agree with the reviewers who found this a morose and gloomy wallow, and the ending is infuriating! George R R Martin, Elizabeth Haydon, Elizabeth Moon and Lois McMaster Bujold ALL write vastly superior fantasy than this. Avoid this one unless you have a prescription for Prozac and need a sleep aid."
5,The best on the subject,"I've bought, read, or browsed through many books on this subject. Granick's book on Amish quilts is the most comprehensive and fascinating I've seen. A delight to read. A delight to the eyes. I recommend it highly."
1,Dont start with this one!,"Definitely as un-PHish like as you can get, so its not an album to be starting your PHish collection with....the reason being that this album is actually Phish playing music written by a friend of theirs (the Dude of Life). Very monotonous...and if you've heard some REAL Phish, then you'll be glad that the Dude is not part of the actual band."
1,Really Bad!,"Why is Phish confusing fans with this horrible album? I would give it no stars, but unfortunately that is not an option!"
2,tries to be funny but doesn't really work,"Without even approaching this as a Phish album, it's still not very good; The Dude of Life tries to make funny lyrics but it comes off as merely pretentious or merely idiotic; a couple somewhat brighter points (Ordinary Day has better instrumental than the rest of it, and TV Show's vocals are the best on the album) still don't make the album worth much at all."
4,Good buy,"You can't go wrong with Casio - good quality and design, excellent value for the price you pay.Yes, other reviewers were right:1. The light is not perfect, but acceptable.2. Adjusting the high tide / low tide is a little tricky - but the final result will bring you in the ballpark. Once adjusted, the tide graph will not be 100% precise, but around +/- 1.5 h, that means: I got it to the point, where if it's chart shows high tide in the interval 11:00 - 13:00, I am confident (I've double-checked it against the company tide chart calendar) that the real high tide falls always for sure between 10:00 and 13:00. I imagine one can do a better job adjusting it and making it work even with higher precision. If you go not by the chart, but by the high tide time it displays, results will be much more precise.Overall, I give it 4 stars.ENJOY!"
3,to big,"cant adjust the band any smaller, will have to take it to a jewler to get a link removed, and im not small, 250,lb. 6'2"""
3,Thanks for Tuning In,Wonderful memories - I am planning to give this to my 35 year old son on October 13 for his birthday. I will be traveling from Phx to Spokane to visit and celebrate with him and his family.He was an avid viewer and was in attendance several times. He had his own science of where the Ladmo Bag would be distributed and was right far too many times to call it chance.
3,Well you have to keep it in mind that...,All the reviews I have read for this CD say how awful this album is and really it's not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. You just have to keep in mind that this album was recorded as a demo and Christina had no voice coaching at all. This whole album is her own god-given talent. It's not a grammy winner by any means but any Christina fan should appreciate it for the fact that it's raw and unprofessional. Sure the lyrics are childish and not the best but she sings her heart out and makes them worth listening to.
3,Just Be Free,"This is nowhere as 'polished' or vocally as strong as 'Christina Aguilera' or the spanish version 'Mi Reflejo' but i still think this is a really good album, with some strong tracks on it. Well worth a listen"
1,IF this isn't WHAT THE GIRL WANTS...It isnt for me,"I respect Christina Aguilera and her decision. What exactly is a demo? Well, basically they are songs recorded to have your voice known among record companies. All singers have made them and WARLOCK records has the nerve to try to take some sunlight from Ms. Aguilera herself? Unbelievable. Her voice in these songs: NOT FULLY DEVELOPED. The actual songs: NOT FULLY DEVELOPED. If you honestly love Christina Aguilera, you wont buy thr cd that could tarnish her reflection. Do the right thing...even if JUST BE FREE is handed to me for free...I wont take it. Will you? I hope not!"
4,Concise and useful reference,"I thought this book was great. It's a little old fashioned but the fitting tips are timeless. It's a small book, but I think that's a plus because it's concise and it was very useful for me. I have another fitting book - The Perfect Fit by Singer, but the Pants For Any Body book filled in the details that the other book lacked."
3,more weird and creepy than funny,"compared to what most people say i think this is a very good movie. the problem with the film was probably the trailers for it. they showed it as this slapstick comedy with a popular rock soundtrack. in reality it is somewhat of a dark comedy with really strange music. anyway, this movie still has it's very funny moments. as i said earlier this movie is very weird and creepy. just the way the characters act you can tell they're not normal. the best actor in this by far is Jason Schwartzman who steals the show. his two songs in it are hilarious. but in short this movie should be seen with an open mind and knowing the fact that you're not going to see a goofy movie."
3,Slackers,The movie came in good condition and worked great however the writing on the front of the case was in English and French as well. Was not expecting that as it was a gift.
1,One star is too generous,Kudos to SINic for an excellent review. This movie is an incredible waste of time.
2,Wheres Rushmore type quality,The movie I just watched it was okay. There were two dudes going for the same chick one was some what I guess cool and the othe was nerdy. The nerd was played by Jason Schwartzmen and he mave as well been the movie because he was the only real bright spot. Some red head dude kept on cheating as did his two friends. The girls roomate was stupid and with a mix of many cuss words that somewhat lead to the nerdy kid also getting thrown out. As I said Schwartzmen is this movie completely
1,Coffee was bad,We buy this coffee all the time at a shop in town. They had a convention in town and they sold out of Jamaican Me Crazy. Found same brand on Amazon and ordered the 4 pack whole bean deal. It doesn't even taste not close to what we buy. The beans are very over roasted and have a burnt smell nothing like we buy. My wife loves Jamaican Me Crazy but want drink this at all and bought a bag of dunkin donut coffee for her to drink. I feel like this coffee should not be in this baag and I wasted my money.
2,These are a choking hazard!,Be very careful when feeding these to your baby. The biscuit falls apart really easily and becomes a choking hazard!
4,A real review by someone with a real baby...,"These barley teething biscuits are very similar to the wheat ones by the same brand. My baby seems to really like them. They're hard enough that they don't break apart or dissolve too fast. I can say that, to me, the wheat are sweeter than the barley. I personally think barley anything tastes absolutely disgusting, but like I said, my baby likes both flavors. At first, I didn't understand why they were wrapped in packs of two, but then I realized that the first one is undoubtedly going straight to the floor, so a replacement is necessary or tears will ensue. Great product, good price, organic! So no worries."
2,This product is a choking hazard!,"I chose these as a substitute for zwieback toast, which has apparently been discontinued. Gerber makes a very similar teething biscuit, but after comparing both, I found Earth's Best to be much healthier. My son LOVES these biscuits, but I will be throwing the rest of them away. For the second time today, he broke off a piece larger than a quarter after sucking on the biscuit for only about a minute. My son is eleven months old and does great with chunky food, but there is no way he would be able to chew these hard biscuits with his gums. I am thankful that I do watch him like a hawk when he eats anything, because this product is dangerous! I will not let my son have these again."
3,Colors don't match,"Why, when a set of bath towels and hand towels are ordered together...don't amazon use their sense and match the dye colors up....this has totally spoilt the experience. I have since washed these towels....they are still mis-matched. The bath towel seams are starting to fray. Don't think they'll last through 10 washes."
3,WOW!,"What an awesome album! This album even includes the new hit ""Never Had a Dream Come True"" which is currently on the radio waves. I find no reason not to buy this CD, so buy it now, I guarantee that you will not regret it"
5,my 5-star favorite,"This CD is great. If you were to get one S Club CD, this would be the one. It's got 11 of S Club 7's best songs yet. I love it! It's my fave CD right now. My favorite song on this CD is Cross my Heart; it's great to sing along or dance to!"
5,My Review,"I just have to say that S Club 7's CD 7 is the best. It has a little of everything a little pop music from Jo,Hannah,Tina,and Rachel and some rap and R&B from ""the boys"" Jon,Paul,and Bradley. From their recent single ""Never Had A Dream Come True"" it has swept not only In the United Kingdom but also MTV and the United States.I have read reviews that Adults like this song and other songs. It is also one of my personal favorite songs that they did. You are probably wondering how they came together... It all started over in England and those 7 that made s club 7 were picked out of over 10,000 auditions. They first started on their show on Fox Family ""S Club in Miami"" and then went to L.A. You should really think about considering to buy this CD I that all 7 of them have really put a lot of time in to it!"
1,not good like their first album,"i liked their first self-titled album, but this one sounds extremely cheesy without sounding good. their first album was cheesy, but at least the songs sounded catchy and good! this is pop music you've heard all before. ""never had a dream come true"" is ok, but i swear i've even heard that before. they also sound tired on this album."
5,S CLub 7 is the bestest ever!!!,"This cd is fantastic! I listen to it all the time and all my friends at school get mad because I sing the catchy songs all the time. S Club 7 is a great band, and this cd is totally worth buying. It's mostly pop, but each of the songs combine different styles, so there's a little bit of rap and other types mixed in too. This cd is totally worth buying!"
2,Reminicent of a Show Choir or Karaoke Back-up Singers,"Way too bland for even my tastes, a lover of Britney, Mandy Moore, etc."
3,"ok way to build your collection of movies,but the transfers are not very good so bewere","this collection of spaghetti westerns is ok and has some good westerns if you like westerns,but on the down side the transfers are not the best and if you want great treansfers then think about looking elsewere for these films!!!otherwise enjoy!!!"
4,For the Pimips and Playas,This cd is tite . Too sSHort is a pimip and is good at rappin bout it. So buy this cd and learn to mack in just 2 days
1,upset with the company of the product,I cannot rate the product as bad because I never did receive the product to give it any rating at all. The company did not even inform me that the product was no longer available.
3,Helmet too small.,"My daughter loves the set, but the helmet is way too small. It is made for a 2 year old - if you're lucky."
1,Serious Disappointment,"I purchased and watched Seasons 1 through 6 and thought that this might have been one of the best TV series ever - Season 7, however is a huge disappointment - the stories don't seem to flow, all of the individual detectives are in constant conflict with one another, and they have added a new twist - some brief scenes with inappropriate music - that lends an air of almost forced comedy as opposed to the serious nature that they are trying to show. I can highly recommend Seasons 1 through 6, but I cannot recommend Season 7. It was so bad I can see why the show was canceled after Season 7."
4,Homicide-Baltimore,A great show but this is not the greatest season although my girlfriend appears in one episode so it's worth the price to me. Add it to your collection. You won't be disappointed.
1,Hate it,"I hate it when the heroine admits her love, before the hero. I do not like at all when the hero has been deeply in love before, and he is not sure if he is over her until toward the end."
2,Could not finish this one,Other reviewers made the same observation that the characters are wed and bed in the first 50 pages. The story just keeps dragging forward with massive insecurities on the caharacters part. Finally just deleted the book from my kindle half way through.
4,Beauty and the Beast,"I would give this a 3 and a half if I could. The characters are likeable and engaging. The story is good, but it lacks a certain suspense. There's no real feeling of urgency to pick it up and nothing that really stops you from putting it down.Gytha is immediately drawn to him and is soon in love with him. The same is true for him. She won't tell him of her love because she fears he won't believe her. He won't tell her because he's afraid she can never love him."
2,I didn't really like this book.,This book was about a girl named Reyna from Spain. Reyna is captured by pirates on her way to an arranged marriage in America. This book was kind of boring and I didn't like it too much.
1,Defective Product,This product arrived in the sealed package but was empty with a little messy toner on the bottom of the cartridge. This is the first time I have experienced an issue with this product. Tip: Purchase the toner from Amazon directly or an office supply store. They are more likely to stand behind the defective product than other vendors.
3,Medicore Continuations,"The story line continues to move slowly with sudden seemingly random jumps. Character development is either non-existant, or is accompished in three actions and moves people forward as if years have occured.I am still not a fan of the mixed style of Anime that is used for this story line. Using computer generated images for the 'Goddesses' while in combat brings memories of older video game movies that were not the best.Overall, the story and content are average, and the feeble attempts at hiding what is in store for the 'heroes' is not done as well as it could have been. This series straddles between trying to be the seriousness of Gasarki, and the silliness of older 'fighting robot' shows."
2,One of the worst anime I've ever seen.,"I watched this for FREE on Cartoon Network and felt ripped off. Don't waste your money and actually buy this horrible series. It's derivative, shallow, and pretentious. The characters are generic, and the dubbing is so, so, so bad. I can't believe how bad it is. The only good thing about the series is the vivid coloration, but so what? It's not like it's worth the pain of actually watching the stupid show.No American distributor should have bought the rights to this because they totally wasted their money. This cartoon is a complete mess and a waste of time."
4,Borderline Personality Disorder,"This book is a good introduction to BPD for the lay person. It is not the final word for a clinical professional. Should be read with the understanding that there are gradations of BPD, as exists among all mental illnesses."
4,Explaining the Borderline,"Read It and weep. It will be discouraging to recognize that some lovedone fits so well the description herein of Boderline Personality Disorder. Yet, to know and to understnd are truly the first steps toward adjustment and reconcilliation, for patient as well as others who are concerned and often victims. Facts are presented dispassionately, leaving little to encourage the reader.Kreisman's book will help clinician and layman alike cut throug the maze of confusion while giving not ony helpful insights, but a few ""to-do"" ideas that may well be the most beneficial therapy some BPD's receive."
3,"Reader from Reading, PA","It took me awhile to get into this book alot of jargon I didn't get, it was a little informative about the borderline personalities of people but sometimes hard to understand and also very short, so I think this book is okay, just could of been more simplfied for the average reader and maybe a little longer in content."
1,Not Impressed,This book is extremely basic. It adds no infomation whatsoever to what one can learn from a brief google search of the topic.
3,Swings from simple to understand to technical and tough terrain,"This book is well written and informative, but also very tough at times to get though technical language. I did learn a lot about a loved one by reading it, but it took commitment to get through. :)"
3,"A very psychological approach, not easy reading",Even as a nurse- this book is tough for me to get through. It would be more helpful to a Doctor. It is also quite old and I believe there needs to be a second volume with updated information. The book did arrive in perfect condition and in a timely manner.
5,A MUST HAVE!,"If you are into any or all three of these bands, this video is a precious time capsule of each of them in their earliest, and arguably best, incarnations. Filmed in a relatively small SF club, the close ups of the facial expressions and interplay of the band members is exceptional. And for the Deadheads, there's rare Pigpen footage - rocking out on ""Hard to Handle."" The version of ""Ballad of You & Me and Pooneil"" is the greatest performance by the Airplane ever caught on film. And of course, Santana, -with his original lineup - is sublime. Don't hesitate on this one."
1,"Toxic, and it sucks!","Not only does this dish washing product contain toxins and non ""green"" ingredients (see other reviews), it sucks! You need tons of it to clean a small load of dishes. An eco friendly product reduces its impact on the environment by not only using less toxic ingredients, but by allowing consumers to use less product per job, thus minimizing overall waste. if you're going to pollute, I'd much rather do it with a product like dawn or palmolive that at least lathers up nicely. For green products, my current fave is Caldrea Dish Soap Liquid. It's a bit pricey but smells amazing (love the lavender pine) and is very concentrated."
1,samsung d806,well i usually love samsungs but im not thoroughly impressed with this one...nothing too special about this phoneand im afraid its not a very high quality product.i do believe i spent too much on this phone and now im just waiting for my next upgrade.
5,Pages full of smiles,This book makes my children smile everytime he reads! He loves to see what Nathan will do next as an energetic premie full of life! This is a great story that lets your kids know they can be anything in life!
4,Excellent way to continue the saga.,"I really liked this book. Some casual fans may get lost but if you're familiar with the E.U. saga this a really good read. If you are a big Star Wars fan you will love this book. Especially with R2 finally begining to spill his guts, but I won't ruin what comes out. You will have to read it for yourself. I can't wait till the second book comes out this fall. Get this book read and enjoy."
5,A gripping story which receives Jonathan Davis' smooth and wonderful style accenting the high drama and science fiction action,"Troy Denning's Star Wars Dark Nest 1: The Joiner King opens a new trilogy in the Star Wars saga, returning the New Jedi heroes to the limelight when Luke Skywalker's nephew and niece vanish into the Unknown Regions answering a call for help only they can hear. It's up to Luke to rescue them and solve the mystery of the Regions in a gripping story which receives Jonathan Davis' smooth and wonderful style accenting the high drama and science fiction action."
3,Terrible,"I really was hoping that the continuation of the Star Wars universe would be something that was a little more...intelligent. This was garbage. Lucas has slowly been killing the Star Wars series. The concept of ""intelligent telepathically linked bugs"" is nothing new. If you've read the original Boba Fett novel trilogy, you'll know what I'm talking about. The characters are incredibly weak. This new perception of the Force is lame and very unphilosophical. I wish what happened to Coruscant/Yuzhan'tar was discussed more than a paragraph. At the end of the NJO they said it would take YEARS to reconstruct it, it seems a little short. Troy Denning has also let us down. Star By Star was simply amazing, the characters, the story line, the drama etc. Definately not his best work."
3,"One word, lackluster","So we just come off the greatness of the New Jedi Order, the Yuuzhan Vong are defeated and Ben Skywalker has been born. What does Lucas books give us? A trilogy that in concept could be absolutely huge! But due to poor writing in many places and an overall abundance of characters that are either unimaginative or frankly unacceptable to the universe (an ill-tempered ewok? That doesn't make any sense!) this trilogy falls into a three star category. The only saving grace is the character development. Jacen starts to seriously walk the double edged path to the dark side in this trilogy and begins to estrange himself from his sister. Read it if you're interested in the Legacy of the Force series otherwise stay away."
3,Gunstock Carving by Jenning,"It is perhaps ok for the absolute beginner and takes you though step by step with many patterns. Bit shallow for me, but does have some good info on source material."
2,depressing book,I didn't like the subject matter or the slow manner in which the plot progressed.Very sad story about the couple married outside the church.I put the book down and returned it to the library.JGR
5,great and thier should be more,"The first three volumes of animaniacs are extremly funny.It has some classic episodes that I have not seen in years. This would be great to buy if you need a laugh or you want to relive old memories or share with a younger generation. The only problem is that you can buy the first three volumes but there might not be a volume four. This set brings you half way through season three and just leaves you. So if enough people buy this, then we might get to finish the series."
5,I wish there were 4 3/4 stars,"I agree with the other reviewers that these puzzles were tough & enjoyable. Every puzzle has a ""trick"" besides the clues themselves. Most novices would find them almost impossible. (It is hard to believe that the first reviewer learned to do cryptics with this book.)The reason , however , that I wanted to do this review, and the reason for my title, is to warn everyone that there are quite a few errors in the clue sections. For example, puzzle #27 is missing clue #27 and puzzle # 30 is missing clue #39 down. There were others in the front of the book but at first I didn't write them down.Oh well, just another challenge in a great book."
4,Not to bad,"I first so this movie when I was living in Ireland so I decide to buy it, it is funny if you know something about the Irish people."
4,"Can I get better service, NOT",I was very pleased with the movie Intermission. I received my product within (2) days and to order it was effortless. 2 Thumbs Up.
2,Colin Farrells performance is the only interesting thing here,"Weak script, the actors do an acceptable job of trying to breathe some life and depth into it but they still dont manage to salvage the film. Theres an air of disdain and snottiness in the script-writers approach to the characters that makes them feel unemotional, plastic. Colin Farrell's role is brief and he plays the worst person in the film but he manages to inject the role with humanity. You believe he is a messed up sociopath but at the same time feel sorry for him on some level without this emotion being forced out of you.Which is good but stands in contrast to most of the rest of the film where the emotions feel forced,over the top and unbelievable. In short theres very few parts of the film where you believe this is anything but people reading lines and playing parts.Colin Farrell saved the film from the scrapheap but beyond his small part theres not much to recommend here unfortunately."
3,OK maybe 3.5 stars,"""God's Cop"" is not on here, which is a must-have HM song. Some of the other mixes are not the best. All and all, a good CD for the Madchester fan...as much for the memories as anything else. I would buy it again, but I would not really recommend it to the unanointed, if that makes sense."
4,caution!,"beware...this is not a greatest hit collection...the 2cd set consists of singles, out takes and live recordings and the sound isn't great on every track...the songs are probably not remixed or remastered, but a good buy anyway, after you have bought kick out the jams, back in the usa and high time..."
5,"I was there, man!","This is the greatest rock album, ever.Wayne Kramer didn't use an SG, he used a Strat painted like the Stars and Stripes. The only thing missing from this album is the intense ear-splitting volume.Brothers and sisters, the MC5's music will drive you wild, into the streets, tearing down everything that would keep us from being free.Kick out the Jams and stay alive with the MC5."
4,very nice for the price,The wig is very nice for the price $+10 arrived fast. Great for me (adult) and for my 4y old for Rapunzel's outfit. Will buy again. NOt gave 5* because could be more hair on the head(center).
5,Wisdom of Dr Lao,"Great show that teaches about greed, lust and other human failings with mythical creatures. You will never underestimate the Lock Ness monster after this show."
2,Ok comp.,"Epitaph has put out way better comps than this. Volume 5 kicked A$$, but this one is a little stale. The stand out tracks are Hot Water Music and the Bouncing Souls. Other than that I am not to taken with thsi new edition."
3,Good comp disc,It's a good cd. Great mix of songs. Nothing thats really awesome. The point of these cd's is to check out other bands. It does it's job. Great ska stuff! bad religion rocks!
2,Poor Edition.,"I hate to say this but I regret buying this sacd. The remastering was bad, the thin vocals oftentimes ia overwhelmed by instruments and at times almost unintelligible."
5,fantastic music,"I was first introduced to ""Pirates"" when I was a teenager and my dance instructor used ""Woody and Dutch"" for one of the dances she taught to us. I fell in love with it immediately, and when I went on to college I saw to it that I had my own copy of the entire album to take with me. It's one of my favorites to this day (especially ""Skeletons""-- what a moving song!!!); to me, it's as if the actual lyrics to the songs are a bonus because the mood of the music and the expressiveness of it and Jones' voice tell me everything I need to know-- that's just how strong the writing is. There's this contrast of tough and vulnerable that flows through all of it that just gets to me. It's is the epitome of bittersweet. An earlier review called it a movie, and that's one way to think of it. The dancer in me always thought it would be cool for someone to create an entire ballet out of it. In any case, ""Pirates"" is a beautiful work of art."
1,This looks very dated,"I bought this video as part of our company's training library. It's a real flatliner, no life at all. Even though the title includes ""...Guide to Getting Hired in the 90's,"" it looks more like it was produced in the 70's. Nothing new or inspiring here -- a real thumbs down."
5,Great Insights Into Great Britian in the 1980's,Paul Theroux gives good information and descriptions. He meets people one would not meet on an ordinary trip. The book gives insights into what people do in different cultural and social situations. He describes the various peoples of the British Isles. I can't travel - so this is my travel.
5,"One is a Genius, the other's Insane","YESSSS! Another fantastic children's TV show has been put on DVD for all to enjoy! This show isn't just for kids though, the show is well written with lots of innuendo. My husband & I enjoy the voice talents of Maurice Lamarche and Rob Paulsen very much, and we will let our children enjoy this instead of some of the rubbish on TV these days."
5,Shoulder Pads,I HAVE ORDERED SHOULDER PADS MANY TIMES AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO PLEASED WITH THE SPEED IN WHICH THEY ARE DELIVERED. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE PRODUCTS. THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRODUCT AND BEING A COMPANY THAT I CAN COUNT ON.
2,Nostalgia,"I didn't realize their style was more polished now. I enjoy their rawer style of old. Particularly 'Forever and Counting', 'No Division', and 'Fuel For the Hate Game'. Buy one of those instead. Don't waste your money on this. I wish I didn't."
4,Tech Deck MADNESS!!,"Dude, amazing skate park, although there is one little flaw. I ride regular, but this park is making me ride SWITCH! I would not recommend this to Tech Deckers that ride regular, but that want to grind and gap regardless of the stance. In any case, this product rocks."
1,NClex,the cover is very deceiving. The seller was trying to push this off as a RN NClex exam. It is actually for LPNs. It was totally irrelevant.
5,I couldn't have passes without it!,"I purchased this text and became frustrated by the questions in it. ""I didn't see any of these drugs in my Pharm class"" I thought,"" This will be a waste of my time"". But I studied and got comfortable with the information in the book and on the pratice tests. When test day came, sure enough, a lot of the unfamilar drugs from the study guide were on the test. I was on asked the mimium required questions, meaning I got most of them right. This is why I say I couldn't have passed without it."
4,As good as Turn in the Road,"Another page-turner. The mother may come across as naive, but this makes the revelations regarding her daughter all the more shocking. Interesting twists in the plot keep you guessing..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCERS OF ALL TIME,"THIS REMINDS ME OF IF DJ SHADOW WAS A MEMBER OF DIPLOMATS. J DILLA DUG THROUGH CRATES UPON CRATES TO COME UP WITH THIS MATERIAL. THESE ARE SOME OF THE LOST, SONIC EMOTIONS OF HIP HOP THAT WILL DESCEND DOWN UPON YOU."
2,Lots of Leaks,I am not really happy with these covers. My daughter can wear them for about an hour and a half until she soaks right through her pants! I think the cheap vinyl pants work better.
2,O well,"Wish I had been able to listen to excerpts before ordering. I enjoy traditional folk music and English music in general (Vaughan Williams, Holst,etc.) but first learned about The Watersons in an obituary of Mike W. in the NY Times. This disc was a disappointment in its lack of variety... only one lively track... not really representative of English folk (morris dance music, for example), although perhaps representative of The Watersons. I recommend anything by Roberts and Barrand instead."
1,Disappointing!,"I have used the services of Amazon.com in the past and have been extremely pleased with the items I have ordered. However, this CD is the worst I have ever heard. The quality of the sound is terrible.The only reaseon this CD received a 1 rating from me was because there was no option to place a 0."
1,Not Well Made...,"Purchased this Union Suit 30 day's ago...Already has a hole on the leg seam...I is just too bad nothing is made in the USA anymore...I am so tired of purchasing Garbage from China,Bangladesh,and all the other country's that produce Garbage with there slave labor..............."
4,"The singles, volume 2.","The truth is, when ""Galore"" was released, it was pretty needed at the time. Their previous singles collection only ran through the ""Head On The Door"" album, and since then they put out four classic/good albums, two live albums, and a remix collection. Overall I think this does a good job, because these are the singles after all. The first half of this is excellent, taking from the ""Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me"" and ""Disintegration"" albums, and adding ""Never Enough"" from ""Mixed Up"". The second half is still good with the hits from ""Wish"", the better songs from ""Wild Mood Swings"", a mix of ""Close To Me"", and the new track ""Wrong Number"". In my perfect world, ""Pictures Of You"" would be the full version, and I'd easily swap the song ""Apart"" for any of the ""WMS"" tracks. Still a solid collection, even if it's not as classic as the ""Staring At The Sea"" disc. There's also the basic career-spanning ""Greatest Hits"" too."
4,A very serviceable greatest hits collection...,"Back in the 1980's, a time equally notable for its compelling music as it was for its social unrest, new wave stalwarts the Cure ruled the airwaves with their unique brand of heartfelt Goth rock. The catchy bass lines, the keyboards, Robert Smith's heartbroken vocals, it's all here on Galore, a nice summation of their best work. Their best work is well-represented with Cure staples like ""Why Can't I Be You?"", ""Just like Heaven"", ""Love Song"", ""Pictures of You"", ""Close to Me"", ""Friday I'm in Love"", and ""A Letter to Elise"" to name a few. There are other notables, such as the spooky, lingering ""Lullaby"" which boasts Robert Smith's mysterious vocals, and ""Wrong Number"" a brand-new track released special with the collection. Overall, Galore, a mostly hits based compilation, is a wonderful introduction to the unique stylings of the Cure, one of the 80's most important and influential rock bands."
4,Great travel toy,"I bought this for an upcoming trip, thought it might keep our 15 mo. old busy on the plane and in the airports. He's really into puzzles now, so I think he'll enjoy it. It will fit perfectly in our travel bag and has plenty of different items to keep him busy. One note, I had seen in other reviews here that others were able to buy it at Toys R Us for $12.99, our Toys R Us in Ft. Wayne is charging $14.99."
5,A favorite for years and years!,Bought this for my first daughter. She continued to play with it all the way from toddlerhood through Kindergarten where she used it for food in her pretend kitchen. I then gave it to my younger daughter who continues to play with it today at nearly 3. It'll get set aside for a few weeks or a month and then she'll pick it up again to play. I just sent it to my sister in-law for her 1 year old and she said she plays with it at home AND in the car. She LOVES it.
4,She Likes It,"I bought this puzzle for my 21 month old niece, and she loves it. She enjoys taking the pieces out and putting them back in, and the music really makes her happy. I like the puzzle because it has large pieces that she can't put in her mouth, and it challenges her because she has to take the pieces out and put them back in. The funny thing is, she discovered that she could turn on the music by pushing the ginger bread man and loves to entertain herself with the music for hours on end. The Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Magnetic Cookie Puzzle was well worth the money and it is a great way to get help develop your baby's motor skills."
4,Romance in the big city,"""It's My Turn"" by Eleni Carr is #11 in the ""First Love from Silhouette"" teen romance series. Debbie's parents are separating, and her mother is moving her and her little brother Robbie from their suburban home to New York City. Debbie rebels against this change in her high school plans, until she learns that the city has its charms too. The descriptions of teen life in the city, so different from my suburban upbringing, were very enjoyable back when I read this a zillion years ago."
2,A slow paced drama!,"Despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script, the story retains its interest. A disturbed woman in his early twenties, who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually, a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons."
1,Poor Service,"The item I ordered did not arrive within the estimated arrival date originally given to me. When I emailed the seller, they stated they would respond within 24 hours and that did not happen either. Disappointing. This won't hinder my Amazon shopping, just from this seller."
3,Generally Good (sorry) Stuff,"This CD opens with two excellent radio-ready songs (""In the Blood"" and ""Good""), then gets a bit more divergent. Nothing else here matches the opening, although ""Teenager"" and ""The Killer Inside"" are both above average tracks. Unless you're a fan (in which case you own this), the songs do tend to run together - about an hour after listening, it's hard to remember which song sounded like what. Not bad rocky pop - it that's your thing, you'll probably enjoy this."
5,Underrated.......,"I think this is one of the more underrated albums and bands of the 90's. Probably an album that you had to get to know in the 90's to truly appreciate today, but worth the listen nonetheless. I can listen to then entire album, but the highlight are Cry In The Sun, Porcelain and This Time of Year."
5,a modern day classic worthy of the ages,"this cd is the album my kids will grow up listening to and my grand kids and so on and so on. this is a great mix of songs and styles and a joy to listen to, now if only i could get my hands on a copy of suprise."
4,Better Than ......Most of today's music,"While this album struck me as being very good when it came out, having just recently found it on my shelf and playing it again only shows me that it's even better than it was seven years ago.While the sound of the songs is very much in line with what was the style at the time (heavy guitar, bass, drum....grunge), the totality of the musical efforts exceeds the sum of the parts in just about each case. The lyrics are often sharp, (""Teenager,) paint vivid mental images (""This Time of Year,"") and metaphorical (""Rosealia""). And while the songs may share a sound, they certainly don't all sound alike. What's more, they're songs you can have going through your head hours after listening to the CD. ""Good"" is probably this CD's most well-known track, but there isn't a stinker in the lot. Maybe 1995 really was ""the good old days."""
5,The Peace U2 Made,"Yes, U2 finally made piece with themselves at a time they were writing War, one of their best and most interesting albums. There isn't a hint of the uncertainty of Boy or the hesitation of October, here you have hard, political-oriented dark, and sometimes scary rock (in the best sense).I won't even try to compare it with some other records that came out at that time - this was way ahead of its time. Come to think of it, it still is. You know, I could go on, but what's the point...this is for your ears, not for your eyes. Enjoy!"
5,This is a classic u2 album,"War was the first u2's album that became a great success.Song like Sunday Bloody Sunday, new year's day and ""40"" are on u2's set list from 1983 to now in concerts.But you can listen to others no classic songs but too important song for you history: Like a song, seconds, drowning man, two heart beats as one and surrender.this DeLuxe version shows others songs in single version or remix and a marvelous booklet."
1,A Classic,"I love this album. I originally had it in cassette format but had to buy it again in CD format because it's so good and such a classic reflection of Christopher Cross' songwriting. He's got those pretty melodies he's known for, along with his distinctive voice, and some great backup vocalists too. Also, if you get a chance, see him in concert!!!"
2,Save your money,"This disc is kind of a slapped-together cd - a low-rent version of your typical tribute album. Pearl Jam, Phish, and Kelly Jones' tracks are all recorded live, and not for the purpose of this cd - they just happened to be recorded well enough to be included. This cd lacks a cohesive listen, and most of the tracks are pretty uninspired or are note-for-note imitations of the original - just with a different singer...I bought this to hear other artists take Who material and make it their own, and what this mostly sounds like is a 'karaoke with the stars' cd.David Bowie's track is the most inspired, but..c'mon, he did this same sorta thing with the same-era Who music on his Pinups album in the early 70s."
3,No Substitute,"Songs From The Who is a compilation of Who cover songs by such devotees as Pearl Jam, Sheryl Crow and others. The problem with the album is that most artists do by the number versions of the songs. Pearl Jam's version of ""The Kids are Alright"", Sheryl Crow's ""Behind Blue Eyes"", Phish's ""5:15"" and Fastball's ""The Real Me"" all sound like they could have been done at a kareoke bar. They don't add their own unique sounds to the songs and they feel sterile. Other artists do rework songs most notably David Bowie who slows down ""Pictures Of Lily"" into an almost dirge and Ocean Colour Scene who infuse ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"" with a modern flair. The Who themselves rework ""Substitute"", but the result isn't that great. But at least they got into the spirit of a cover album, reworking an artist's songs into a different sound."
3,A tribute?,"This CD isn't bad, but it could've been a lot better. Some of the songs were recorded live, while others are studio. It is obvious that the selections were not recorded specially for a tribute CD. But that's not the biggest problem with this collection. The biggest problem is that while this CD is supposed to be a tribute to the Who, one of the songs features the Who! It's like they're paying tribute to themselves?! This CD does contain some good Who interpretations, but it's not enough to save this compilation."
5,Wonderful!,"This conditioner (and its sister shampoo) really keeps my red from fading. It's the only product I've found to do so. I use it every other shampoo, alternating with a sulphate-free color preserving shampoo. Red is such a difficult color to maintain and this really does the trick between salon visits."
5,go rhino reciever hitch step,"I am very pleased with this product. It does just as it is intended to do. It is large enough to be a useful step to reach into the bed on my 2013 GMC 2500 HD. Also will be great protection for my bumper. It does have a little side to side movement, but seems very stable, with little to no rattle."
5,Rhino Black Hitch Step - Jeep 2006,"Great product. Helps guard the rear mounted tire. Asures a little extra rear end bumps. The curved lines of the hitch step blend in nicely with the contour of the vehicle, and no more banging your chins. The depth of the hitch step is adjustable, so if you don't have a rear mounted tire - no problem."
4,"Sharp, functional knives--worth more than their price ($)","These knives are quite sharp--certainly sharper than the set we replaced--and work well for everyday use. I didn't love the wood block (which is ligher than our previous set) and I missed the bread knife (which, as any discerning reader can tell, is NOT included here), so we simply used our old knife block, and old bread knife, too. (How sharp does a bread knife need to be?) These are highly-functional, save us lots of prep time, and are worth more than the super-discount price paid (low thirties). Enough for me to forgive the silver styling and ligher balance of the knives, when compared to more expensive brands. Still very glad we bought these!"
5,VIEW,The book arrived in a timely manner and I am looking forward very much to reading it as it was highly recommended to meby a local author who was inspired in his writings by this book.
3,iQueM4 Problems,"The preloaded maps work great. I have had terrible problems with the plug and play street maps however. Avoid them.Also, customer service won't help you unless you have registered your device. Do it online as soon as you get the device."
5,Garmin iQue M4 GPS-Enabled Pocket PC,"Most flexible GPS I could find, can do road, nautical or topo maps plus it's a pocket pc. Found it easy to use, accurate, and it's portable. This is the second unit I've purchased."
2,The Death of a Narrative in French Cinemas?,"Intellectualization of a pornography in the name of love and sex and then wrap it up as a comedy. To me, this film is neither funny nor imaginative."
5,The Secret of Good Humor Makes Great Music,"Just as King of New Orleans starts, hit rewind on your CD player and go back a clandestine 3 minutes for a ""live"" treat. Better than Ezra know how to write beautiful, emotional, and stimulating music, and can put on a show just as superb!"
3,Another solid outing from BTE.......(3.5 stars actually),"The great thing about Better Than Ezra is that they have their own distinct sound that is fresh and original. Im not really sure whatever happened to this band but this is one of those CD's I listen to once in a blue moon and it never fails to bring a smile to my face.There weren't that many radio hits from this CD (Desperately Wanting and King Of New Orleans) but the whole album is solid. The songs are pretty random and there is no theme to the album but BTE's always manages to mix meaningfull lyrics with snazzy guitar riffs. Return of the Post Moderns is a silly song that is one of my favorites from the record. Rewind is pretty as well and the album ends strong unlike Delux, their previous effort.Bottom Line: worth picking up if you see this in a used bin (which you usually do) Suffers from AIO syndrome- Anoying If Overplayed."
4,One of the best safety bars made,The Moen DN7005 tub safety bar is made strong and was very easy to install. I installed it in 15 min. which is very fast for me. My mother saw it and ask me to get her one too.
2,Good reading for high school level,Was excited to read it but slightly dissapointed after finishing it. While the book seems well researched it lacks critical facts that need be understood before attempting to analyse the complexity of tribal Europe after WWI war. With the exception of the 4 big players many other descriptions are not anything more than caricatures. The author defends the results of the peace conferece while making little to no reference to the will of the people inhabiting the areas in question. This is needed to better understand the real impact of this major historical event on the rest of the 20th century.Nevertheless this is a good starter for people that know little to nothing about the 20th century Europe and its complexities and want to know what questions they need ask from further readings.
1,Propaganda or History?,"Unfortunately it is no accident I think, that Margaret Macmillan is the great grand daughter of Lloyd George. This book essentially reflects a British interpretation of the treaty of Versailles, and not least, a more positive view of David Lloyd George. It strikes me as more of an op ed piece than sound history. In my opinion readers should be forewarned that this is a piece more closely akin to World War I British propaganda than anything else. With this in mind,the book is interesting and the manifold details are fascinating, albeit misleading. It is well worth reading with a big pinch of salt. It is ""a page turner"" alright. Nonetheless,I would advise them to look elsewhere for a history of the Versailles treaty,its creation and creators, and its effects. The biases are quite subtle and even clever, but they are there."
4,A good but tedious book on the Peace Conference of 1919,"This book is about the Paris 1919 Peace Conference following the end of World War I. It is nicely organized and focuses on all aspects of the negotiations. The book is fairly long, due to the high amount of detail that was included. The research the author did was amazing and she included a great deal of information in her book. This is good and bad because I found the book to be tedious to read after awhile. About halfway through I got bored of the book.This is by no means light reading so I only recommend it to people who are genuinely interested in this topic. Otherwise you will probably be a little bored and find this book somewhat difficult to wade through."
4,learned a great deal,"How leaders of great nations after WWI showed such awful greed - they acted like children in a school yard. The author lays out very well how the decisions that were made at this time impact us even to today. Many interesting parts and excellent profiles of the people involved. Although at certain times the book becomes a burden with so many details.I also believe she is wrong about how the Treaty of Versailles contributed to WWII. It wasn't the only reason but she writes that it had very little part in the rise to Hitler. On several pages she writes about how humiliating the treaty was to Germany and then she discounts the whole matter. Regardless, I enjoyed the book and learned a geat deal about the world, and its leaders from the early 20th century."
4,Introspective music with a touch of humor,"Deanna seems to pride herself on singing ""so true she cries"" and at that she clearly succeeds! This cd contains lovely introspective songs which range from quiet heartbreak to joy of experience to anger at self and selfs' brokenness. Her jazz roots show and shine on the final piece, which also shows Deanna's fine sense of humor. Well worth the listen and purchase."
4,very good book,"very eye opening, you really get a sense of what was going on in his head. you get a better understanding of this man."
1,Meanderings of a Madman,"Aside from the racist, xenophobic rhetoric, ""Mein Kampf"" is a difficult book to read. I didn't enjoy reading it and I was only too glad to get rid of it.Hitler didn't write this book, rather, he dictated it to fellow Landsberg prison inmate Rudolf Hess. Consequently, ""Mein Kampf"" comes across as a heavy, meandering, disjointed piece of work that lacks intellectual integrity. It also reeks of narcissism and megalomania and, as such, much of what Hitler said should be taken with a grain of salt.Historians will undoubtedly find it useful for studying the mindset of Hitler and how he used his rhetoric to seduce the German people and lead them to war and self-destruction. Other than that, there's not much to recommend this book and as far as I'm concerned, it should be thrown on the garbage heap of history."
1,Poorly written,There seem to be a number of people downloading the public domain version of James Murphy's notoriously bad translation and trying to make a quick buck on it. This is one of those times. This edition is obviously from the web. It has the same OCR errors as the web version. The Murphy edition itself is a very poor quality translation as Murphy was not a fluent German speaker and relied heavily on his German dictionary. This fact is clear from the stilted style of the writing and he also uses many incomprehensible words. You need a dictionary to read his translation and even then it is a challenge to understand.I gave this edition one star because it is a copy of a public domain web version so you should not have to pay for it when it is already free and it also got one star for being such a poor quality version.
2,error in title...,"hey, folks.this book is banned in many many countries, because of its content (so it is here, in germany) and i think this is the right way. the author of this book is the worst guy of the 20th century and is responsible for the death of millions of ppl and the destruction of europe.anyway, for some ppl it may be interesting nevertheless.for those i got a hint: the german title on the cover is misspelled. it says here ""mein kamfp"". right: ""mein kampf"".it may be a hint for the quality of translation the book has inside."
2,Ho-hum.,"For me, the LAMEST Judas Priest CD (which is still better than the best CD's by most bands). Dumb lyrics (the only thing dumber than the lyrics to ""Hot Rockin'"" is the video - awful) and mostly boring songs. ""Heading Out To The Highway"" is good, ""Don't Go"" is so-so (about as simple as a riff gets), ""Desert Plains"" disappointed me since I thought it sounded so good on the VHS version of ""priest...live!"". Only add this to your collection if you're trying to collect all the JP discs. Otherwise, go with the superior ""Screaming For Vengeance"" or ""Hell Bent For Leather""."
3,"""I say NO"" too","This album's recording was rushed in mid 1980 to follow up on British Steel's US success in spring of 1980. It shows. All the songs are short by Priest standards, and for the exception of ""Highway"" and ""Solar Angels""...pretty tame by Priests high standards established in their ""Sin through Steel"" foursome.""Hot Rockin'"" is considered classic even by diehards, but the lyrics are dumb and lack substance. I feel most of these songs were B sides and scrapped demos from the more powerful and heavy ""Steel"" with the exception of ""Highway"". ""Solar Angels"" is not as heavy as spoiled fans are accustomed to, but I admittedly love the atmospheric and sound effects that go along with the guitar. The last 4 songs are absolutely brutal. A song from side B is referenced in my title which a previous critic also did. This is easily the black sheep recording from their golden 77'-84' era starting with ""Sin"" and ending with ""Faith""."
3,"I still like Vengence the best, but... my favorite Priest tune is here.","I still like Screaming the best but my favorite Priest song of all time is on this particular CD. It's called Desert Plains. From what I understand, Halford lived, or still lives, here in Arizona. That would explain Solar Angels, that's for sure."
4,3.5 Stars- actually very underrated.,"Upon hearing the first listen to the album I thought the album was rather... meh. But with multiple listens, the album has grown on me. I really like ""Heading Out to the Highway"", ""Solar Angels"" and ""Desert Plains"". In fact, I also sort of like the hard rock feel this album has. This album will make you feel like you're riding a motorcycle through the Arizona desert. The reason this gets only 3.5 is because of The last 3 songs kinda suck. But anyways, to make things short, this is a damn fine album, one worth adding to your collection.PS. Another thing. Why the hell did they use printer paper for the road on the cover? As well as the cardboard on the back of the image? What's with that?"
1,Remastering Error To Be Aware Of,"The song ""On The Run"" has a remastering error at about 2:03 into the song where it 'skips'. It's a defect in the master CD that was copied to all the retail CDs. The band is aware of it as the following was posted on their web site: ""We are aware of the glitch in 'On The Run' and told Sony not to let it out like that but they had already shipped a bunch out - needless to say we are not happy about it at all. You can imagine how we feel when we spent so much time on putting together a great package to find out that once it left our hands not very much care was taken - all we can do is apologise and hope it doesn't spoil The Re-Masters for you. Still I suppose it's par for the course as we always had these sort of problems with labels! Jayne Andrews -- Management Co-ordinator for JUDAS PRIEST."" I'm rating this remaster as 1 star until the error is fixed (which I hope will happen at some point)."
5,Export Import Banking by Shaterian,"This is an excellent work on the evolution of export/importbanking, trading, letters of credit, the purchase and saleof foreign exchange, collections, foreign trade definitionsand a whole host of pertinent subjects. Sample forms areprovided. For instance, the work depicts the following forms:o Bills of Exchange o Dock receiptso Forwarder's Receipt o Cargo Insurance Certificateo Marine Extension Clauseso Trust Receiptso Hypothecation Agreements and much moreThis book is for the student who intends to do extensiveinternational trading. Basic definitions are explained exhaustively. The work is well worth the price charged."
3,"1 CD is good, other is worthless","Being fairly new to cosmic gate, I had high hopes after hearing some of their stuff on the internet. This CD failed to capture me as much as what I had previously heard.The first CD had a lot of great dance on it and some good hard trance. The first track alone is almost worth the price of the set! The second CD however got very digital, psy and goa trance like, and simply was not what I expected at all.If you're a trance and hard trance lover (with some dance roots), the first CD is up your alley, but that second CD will simply wear out the skip button on your cd player."
5,Timeless -- this is still a favorite,"The wonderful child characters come alive in this story -- Bobbie, Peter, and Phil are believable, even if the situations they find themselves in are sensational. Their behavior is childlike and admirably brave. We really like this book.This is just right for read-alouds."
5,Great book by Edith Nesbit,"This is an excellent adventure about three children and a Railway. Phyllis, Peter are always alert and will complete any task they need to, to achieve their goal."
5,Great price,"This is a good price for this watch. There is no light in the watch but this is a good watch with great price , and fast shiping. Thanks"
5,Great Watch,"Looks good, feels good, features are easy to use.Is not too large or overbearing on the wristThe color scheme is awesome for a simple, casual look"
3,In need of some help,"I purchased these a few weeks ago in a large and they were extremely big on my son. My main reason for choosing them is because I have read many reviews stating they don't leak. However, it seems that I still have to change his clothes because he ends up wet(he's also wearing Gerber training underwear beneath these). I'm wondering if this has to do with the fact that they are so big. Is anyone one else having this issue. I'm also trying to figure out if both sides are the same. When I recieved them, the tag was on the outside and once I put it on the inside, the stitching didn't look correct. Is the tag supposed to be on the outside?Dee"
4,Good purchase for a child learning the time,"I got three for my three kids. They are not too expensive considering they will grow out of them. Colorful and fun to learn the time. Labeled and numbered accordingly for teaching kids. Comfortable to wear with the elastic band, and no issues with skin allergies. I saw they also have younger boy designs. I would recommend them to friends with kids."
4,Child watch,I purchased this watch for my almost eight year old granddaughter who already knew how to tell time for Christmas and she loves it. It is a very well made watch for a child. The only downside I have found is that with the elastic style band it easily slips off her wrist when taking her jacket off. Other than that small downfall it's a great watch.
5,great bag good customer service,"Great bag, many compartments,and you can still mount in the center your bike computer. Was missing a screw the company mailed out the same day. Highly recommend."
3,Casio can't see,"The watch is basically what I was looking for. A cheap watch with a silicon watch band that I could wear to play golf in and not worry about sweating on it and or loosing it. The problem with this watch is that the hands are gold and so is the watches face, thus making it hard to see what time it is in the sunlight."
1,Don't buy from J&M,Great Bench; however don't buy from J&M; !!!Terrible customer service the bench they sent me was obviously used and they refused to exchange the bench for a new one. Buyer beware is very true with J&M; !
2,No universal connection,"To me, this was a well written but small minded book, about a very limited world -- italian american, New york City, mafiosi, boxing. Unless your life touches on one of these catagories, you'll have a hard time relating to this book, because the author has an inability to go byond his subject to show me why I should care."
1,Bad product,"I purchased one of these about 14 months ago for about $25.00. I loved the look and feel of it but after a few months it quit working...would not light. It carries a full warranty so I boxed it up, followed the instructions, paid about $5.00 to ship it back. I also had to send $6.00 S&H for a return lighter. I did receive a new lighter but after about 7 months it had the same problem not lighting. I boxed it up and sent it back with the $6.00. That was March 24, 2008. About mid-April I starting sending emails to their customer service area. After no response to three emails, on April 21 I called their office and was told the man who is in charge of returns had been gone for three weeks. He told me he had seen my emails but that they do not respond to emails and that he would check on my return and call me. It's now 4/23 and I have not heard from him. So far, I have invested nearly $50.00 in this lighter and feel pretty silly for doing so. I certainly will not purchase another."
5,I pity the fool!,"One of my girls favorite movies and she loved it. I enjoyed it alot too.Mister T for President, ya'll!"
5,Amazing film,"amazing film, had this on Beta max when it first came out so it was great to watch again"
3,Cheesy Fun,"""D.C. Cab"" may not be high art, but it is cheesy fun. Does the plot really matter here? Nah. The cover makes it look as if Mr. T is the star of the film, but he's not featured in the film that much, though he is entertaining when he is onscreen. Also, watch for Gary Busey, Bill Maher, Marsha Warfield, and I believe that's director Joel Schumacher in the joke after the end credits. Hey, there are worse movies you could watch."
5,Brilliant text book to learn how to debate in Englsih!,This book surely deserves 5 stars and it's just as wonderful as I heard. I read it on a daily basis to prepare for writing tests.
2,Scared both of my children to tears,"I was given this book when my eldest daughter was 14 months. The first time we read it, she broke into tears. After this happened again, we put the book away. Last week, my 18 month old read this book at a play group and started crying as well. This is unusual behavior for my otherwise strong girls. It just was not appropriate for their age. It is odd that a board book is recommended for 4 - 8 year olds."
1,BOOO-RING!,"I have to agree with the other reviewer ""Tired Heart"" this is the LAMEST kirtan I have ever heard. Put the cd in, fast forward to any random place and it all sounds exactly the same--droning drunken voice and harmonium. I also bought Bhagavan Das ""NOW"" with this which IS fantastic, btw, but PASS on this!"
5,Fantastic CD,I love this CD. Very happy and high energy. Fantastic to study to as it keeps me going at a good pace and keeps me upbeat.
5,PGI-5BK,The produck was as it stated Genuine Canon. I own a canon printer and Genuine canon products seem to work the best in my printer.
3,Helen st. John....is the best performer from this album,"good music , a lot of variation , and mr. Giorgio Moreder did his job good . but I give my credit to ( pianist ) Helen St. John who ws performed in ""Love Theme"" ; the music is so exotict, romantic, and so superb....and another good KICK !!! like a Lady lady lady.....( i love the ending part ) ...... and Mr. Sembelo's maniac.....cos I am a maniac"
1,Don't get tricked.,"Although these films are colorized by the same studio as the Columbia DVD's, they lack the creative control and direction. The public domain prints are not completely restored (sound or picture-at best its like a videotape copy), the colorization is distracting (mostly browns and blues with the exception of the bright pink carnation Moe wears and a mint green for Curly's suit-it makes you recall the Turner color process), and the ""behind the scenes of colorizing"" is a joke (very homemade and at one point they note that the era in which Malice in the Palace was filmed was the Depression!)"
1,Not worth it,"Granted I am only on page 109, but probably won't finish it. I am usually the type who must finish a book once started, bit I won't waste my time with this one. It is poorly written with a halting storyline. There is a gratuitous amount of exclamation points that is extremely obnoxious. I actually skip the end of sentences just to avoid them. Don't bother reading this, there is much better fantasy out there."
4,A short book with so much to give,"I was delighted to read this book, my very first by this author. I thnk it is wonderful that it presents the battle between the religion and human intellect both through their frailty and ambiguity rather than judgement. The descriptions of and their conversations between main and supporting characters are minimalistic and very effective in conveying the message they carry, and not overpowering. A very special book."
4,Phil Spector,"Whatever Spector has become and however crazy he was, there's no denying he turned record producing upside down with his wall of sound. Many of the haunting girl group hits from the sixties were produced by this genius. This compilation is a must for any rocker's collection."
3,cuter to humans than cats,"of the 4 cats in the house, 2 ignore the Activity Center completely, 1 will lay on top of it, while the 1 we thought least likely to play with it will bat around the attached toys for a few minutes."
2,Disappointed,"I'm going to have to say overall, on this double-disc from Sander & Lee, I am disappointed.Now I absolutely loved both of his previous ""This is Everybody"" releases. Those two sets gave me over 4+ hours of great music!For some reason though, this ""On Tour"" one doesn't do anything for me. The excitement and energy seem to be zapped out of it. The track selections just aren't that great.It's not like it's awful or painful to listen to; it's just not that interesting. I had a hard time sitting through all of it at once. It's a big letdown from what I had expected/hoped for.I'm still fairly hopeful that This is Everybody 3 will return Sander to his top-notch form. If you're a serious Sander collector, wait for the used copies to start popping up on this one."
3,TOO BIG,"I bought these along with Gerber Waterproof Pants. These are HUGE compared to the Gerber for the same age. I checked to make sure they actually sent me size small. I've kept them, and plan to use them when she gets bigger. Just know the sizing is not correct. I'd guess these are more like mediums."
3,convenient but hard to play,"The Roll A Piano was delivered rapidly. It was quite cheap compared to other similar items, I believe the cheapest available on Amazon at the time. I haven't been able to try the other brands, but I find the keys to be quite hard to press. It's more a toy than something to practice with. The speakers are ok and it's possible to plug in headphones (to be purchases separately). In conclusion, considering the very low price, I would give it a rating of 3/5."
5,Great value on quality products,"You always get top notch products. If you do not check Amizon before you buy anything, you probably enjoy wasting money!"
1,"Not worth the price, even a low price","I bought this watch a year ago assuming that Casio would still have a decent level of quality at a low price point. I only wanted something that was waterproof and somewhat durable. The 10-year battery was a bonus that pushed me to buy it.I cannot recommend this watch because it fails in the most basic, necessary function -- the watch loses time. In other words, the quartz movement that drives the analog watch is off, so that within one day the watch can lose 20 minutes. That's just too much to be off for such a short period, even at a low price.I will not buy another cheap Casio watch. For that matter, I will probably pony up at least $40-50 instead to get a watch that is accurate and will last instead of a piece of junk like this one. And similar to others, the plastic face does get scratched up pretty easily if you do anything outdoors related."
2,it's okay,"Bought it as a work watch, and I broke off the pin within a week. For it's price, I would buy it again. But, I'm not."
1,Overpriced but good product,"I found it $14 cheaper at Office Max two days after I got the package and started using it. The product is very nice - I can pick up voices from across the room clearly. Too easy to record over when you don't want to do so, but you can move the recording to a separate folder and return back to the original folder to avoid it. Carry extra batteries!"
2,"No 'Off"" switch","I use this recorder for class lectures and while the microphone adequately picks up the professor, I dislike the unit as Sony failed to provide an 'Off' switch. So if you buy this unit, be prepared to either 1) spend money on batteries, or 2) manually take them out and put them back in, resetting the time, date and settings. Batteries last roughly 2 weeks (this is based on recording about 5 1/2 hours a week; the rest drains away in my backpack...)"
1,There has to be something better,"I am a new student to New Product Development and I am sure that the information in this book is helpful. However, as another reviewer mentions the book contains too many words for too simple subjects. The writing itself is filled with incomplete sentences and poor sentence structure, some examples are, ""And on and on"" and ""Doing the sales forecasts poses no problem as such."" Avoid reading this book! The grammar and very long unclear descriptions and high cost make it worthless."
2,Quite useless,Many points/ideas are common sense.Many points/ideas are repeated in multiple chapters.It just uses too many words on simple topics.This 550-page book can be easily rewritten in less than 100 pages.
3,New Products Management,"Let's face it, texts are not becoming any cheaper. While not escalating like tuitions, they are more than they used to be 20 years ago, inflation included. For that increased amount, the text better be damn good and chuck full of material to get the new student on the right path, and the professor on course with the latest material.So does this book fit the bill? Yes and no. A lot of this is rehashed material from what I can see pertaining to methodology, but there is a strikingly large amount of mention to recent products. This may be because the book was originally written in 1983, with seven updates including the '06 version.I am not an educator so will leave this one to the professionals to decide if the newer text warrants the wrath of the students for a new edition or not.For educators and students and product managers who used to be engineers (there are more than you think out there).Note: why do textbooks look like text books? The design is very 80's."
1,Los Maestros no profetizan,"Todo estudiante serio, sincero y diligente de la Luz sabe que, por Ley C√≥smica (que los Maestros Ascendidos son y que establece el LIBRE ALBEDRIO del ser humano, de la Llama Triple Individualizado), los Maestros Ascendidos NO PROFETIZAN, toda vez que esto los har√≠a constituirse en SUGESTIONES EXTERNAS, a la cuales el mismo Saint Germain nos exhorta a hacernos impermeables como requisito ""sine qua non"" para hollar el Sendero de retorno al Padre.El que la Sra. Prophet salga a decir que los Maestros SI profetizan le da pie a los buscadores para comprobar o desmentir por cuenta propia la integridad de su auto-proclamaci√≥n (no confirmada y ampliamente cuestionada) como ""Mensajera de los Dioses"".Obviamente, no se trata de otra cosa que de un ardid comercial m√°s ¬°Que aquel que tenga oidos para oir, oiga!"
2,Truth in Advertising Needed,"There's a couple of things I wish someone had told me before I paid 16 bucks plus shipping for this CD: 1. The disk is subtitled ""The Alternate Takes"". So these are versions that were never released, sometimes for good reason. The liner notes are kind enough to compare these versions to the ones released, pointing out the probable reasons for their being rejected. But they don't tell you where the released takes are available. 2. The sound is particularly bad. As one who collects early recordings (including on 78 rpm) I accept some degree of hissing and scratching, but some of these cuts are, even for me, unlistenable. I would think someone would have to be a scholar or a deranged blues fanatic to buy this CD at full price. But if you MUST have these sides to complete your Lucille Hegamin collection, spend away! Accompanying musicians include Tommy Ladnier, Jimmy O'Bryant, Don Redman, Miff Mole, Charlie Green and Jelly Roll Morton. Great, when you can hear them!"
2,Poor quality recordings trump rarity,I agree with an earlier reviewer. Some of these recordings are unlistenable. Their poor quality trumps their rarity.
5,Don't judge by the cover,"OK, the cover is a bit silly. The layout and the binding of the book feels a bit cheap to me. But look on further. Lots of small chapters allow you to refer directly to what you need.The book gets to the point and answers your questions quickly. It bears the mark of a good editor. My favorite part about the book is when he writes from the perspective of the bank. You get a good solid look into how bankers will perceive you and your actions. He even classifies, humorously, different types of bankers.The contents deserve a much cover and nicer layout inside. I am looking for my first big bank loan and with this book, I need nothing else."
3,Reality or literature?,"This book contains all the most powerful scholarly arguments, including consensus, to ascertain the reality of Jesus' resurrection, and deals with all the arguments that have been held against it.Except that in Jewish literature, miracles were ""literary signs"". The same goes for the resurrection, which according to the Didache is the ""third sign"" after the deployment (of angels?) and the sounding of trumpets. In the Didache, resurrection is viewed as a future event. Mark claims it happened.What then did Mark have so imperatively to demonstrate with the resurrection argument, an acknowledged literary sign? I would like scholars to give an answer."
3,Cute yet typical storyline,Good for a 4 year old girl yet some of the other Barbie movies are better. My granddaughter liked it.
5,This is one of my favorite Barbie movies ! ! ! !,This movie is great ! ! ! ! It adds to the princess aura of my room ! ! ! ! It plays nicely and It came at the same time as Barbie Mariposa ! ! ! ! No complaints at all :D ! ! ! !
2,boring,"most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!!!"
2,"OK show, other Barbie movies much better",My 3 year old daughter is a Barbie/Disney Princess fan and loves the movies for both. I was looking forward to Fairytopia's release so we could have something new to watch. I was sorely disappointed. The movie lacks story-depth and music. I really enjoy watching the other Barbie movies--because of the singing or ballet moves and classical music. Fairytopia is none of those. It's just lacking....
3,"the kids like it, but it's not something I can sit through","My parents sent my two daughters (3 and 2) Fairytopia and they seem to really enjoy it. It has fairies, Barbie, and bright colors. However, those three things alone don't make a good movie. As an adult watching, I was disappointed. The animation is lacking as well as the script, character voices, and overall sincerity of the movie. I do like the messages sent throughout the movie, but it's still unbearable to sit through. We have Swan Lake as well and hope it's better than this one. I'd skip buying this one unless you enjoy collecting Barbie."
4,Great entertainment value,"My 3-year-old niece loves to watch this movie and play with her beautiful Barbie fairies and friends. The story and characters are good, though Barbie Princess and the Pauper and Rapunzel are superior - don't miss them! Fairytopia is a wonderful setting for magical adventures, and we're looking forward to sequels."
5,Bestofall,"This particular album came out in a time period when a lot of change was taking place, and it offered songs that were full of life and hope. I think it should be placed back on the record store shelves and promoted once again. at this present time in life, people should have music made available to them that has as uplifting feeling with it, no matter if it was just made, or if it was made 30 years ago. This album will never go out of date. it is one of the best of all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Short and sweet, but a bit below par for TMBG","I am not sure why this EP is so much easier to find than far superior They Might Be Giants EP's such as ""Back To Skull"" and ""S-E-X-X-Y."" While the title track makes this single a must-have, the B-sides are only mediocre. ""Jessica"" is played well, but does not really offer much new to the song, while ""Whirlpool"" is rather uninteresting. The last song is ""Spy,"" which went on to become one of the weakest John Henry tracks. This is a good buy, certainly, but it is not one of the band's better EP's."
2,"Disappointed, what a shame","Ordinarily, after 3 or 4 listens to a good CD a few songs start to stand out as superior. On an excellent CD that pattern may continue until all the songs have had their turn. After 6 listens to ""Back to Me"" ... nada, zip, nothing. The songs sound more and more alike. I'm no expert at writing music but I know when I hear a musical pattern that is repeated over and over and over, and I hear it on this CD. The sound is pleasant, but ultimately boring and not one song is memorable. Alas, after the hype I'd hoped for more. Oh well, to the used CD market it goes."
5,A haunting set of songs with poetic lyrics,"This is one of those few disks that I have listened to a hundred times. These are mostly love songs but not of a syrupy nature. The music is simple, not over produced. The lyrics have a depth to them that transcend any time frame. He sings in a high (contra tenor) voice that is easy to mistake for female, but the songs and his voice are powerful and at times disturbing (but then so is love). It's not for everyone, but I recommend that you give this a try. I hope that you are not disappointed."
4,THE WONDERMENT CONTINUES!!!.,"MISTER JOHN BYRNE is almost pushing his talents to thier very limits by presenting these wonderous epics topped with such splended art!!. VISIONARIES vol three collects FANTASTIC FOUR volume one #251 to#257, annual#17, AVENGERS #233 and the THING #2,respectivly.The exploration of the NEGATIVE ZONE dominates this set generally, ANNIHILUS tries to capitalise on the FF absense but suffers a nasty defeat with the assistance of the AVENGERS.ONE highlight is issue #252 in which you have to hold this set at a different angle to read it!!.In issue #257 NOVA led the ALL POWERFUL GALACTUS to and he consumed the SKRULL THRONEWORLD, sending an interplanetary empire into total anarcy and a downward spiral!!, a major event.Overall it's another good set, recomended to diehard FF fans, general satisfaction is assured!!."
2,Overwhelming!,"I bought this book with all intentions of reading it every other night. It is so comprehensive and overloads you with so many facts, that I ended up getting frustrated. I think I've read it, like 4 times. The book is so huge that it's a pain to carry around. The disk is O.K, though. This book is alright if you have tons of time-and have the memory capacity to remember every detail, but if you can't get overloaded with a ton of facts, I would not recommend it. I just bought Kaplan's and love it."
5,Lesley Gore at her finest!,Every song is excellant in production. The songs cover a wide range of teen age worries (mostly boy-girl problems). Lesley's voice is well suited to the arrangements and gives life to the songs.
1,Back to accounting!,Professor Lewis should stick to writing accounting textbooks and forget mysteries!
1,I'm still waiting for this product.,After 2 months I'm still waiting for this product. I have not received the product yet.
1,This is not HD,"I was really excited when I heard about West Wing in HD. But to be honest, just buy the DVDs - the video and audio quality is much better than this HD bundle. It's a lame attempt by WB to appease West Wing fans for wanting blu-ray."
4,Sorkin knows what he's doing.,"This show is not quite of the literary stature of a Deadwood or a The Wire, but the dialogue is sharp and fun, and the emotional notes typically land with a satisfying whump. This season is among the strongest."
5,A civics lesson that's absolutely fascinating,"I have been a fan of ""The West Wing"" for years. It's refreshing to find a television series that is both very entertaining and intellectually challenging. I have only one caveat about the show, and that the pace of the banter can be somewhat overwhelming and unrealistic at times.Beyond that, I think this show should be watched by everyone who is interested in the mechanics of politics."
3,"Less Punk, More Rock - Meh","Veni was much better than Tyrannosaurus. The first had a refreshing punk! sound, while this one is less so. However, there are some great songs on this CD. For example, the opening to ""Diabolic Scheme"" is so awesome! If you don't sit up, you're dead! ""Love in the Plaster"" is easy to relate to. It's sort of like the sequel to Veni's ""Find Yourself Another Girl"".Only three stars, because the Veni CD reminded me of mania and dancing. Tyrannosaurus is only bobbing your head to the beat."
3,The Decline and Fall of the Hives Empire,"You can't fault the Hives for trying. They're 123845% more stage presence, deliberate smugness, and sheer energy than any of the other bands awkwardly straddling the indie-commercial fence, but they make me feel more sympathetic to their simultaneous lack of indie credibility and real commercial sucess than energetic.Oh, I hear they perfom music too. As for Tyrannosaurus Hives, 'Abra Cadaver' sounds like an amped up Stooges as heard by a 13 year old first getting into punk rock, which is to say that if the rest of the album lived up to this standard, I'd have a new favorite band. Unfortunately, it doesn't, and the Hives really do seem headed towards extinction, through no fault of their own. Nine years is a long time to be following the same formula, but for a band of onetime Swedish punks whose dream was to become Killed By Death cult legends, the Hives had a good run."
1,people figure out how to apply this waffle?,"Ok, I get it. I'm self absorbed, I'm imperfect, it's my fault, I should get a grip. Did I miss anything about how messed I am from my upbringing and you've got the answers? My wife laughed and then tossed the book back after about five minutes declaring this guy an impractical idiot.That's a good way to put it. Nothing here will make your life better unless you're a sexually repressed person who needs to be told it's okay to have sex for reproduction but that thing don't go in your mouth.There are far better sexuality books out there that are meant to treat most everyone and not make you a robot. This guy should only be sold in Christian book stores because that's where he belongs."
5,Good text,"This easy to read text was a good book for helping me learn biology for my college classes. I really liked topics on animal structure and function and ecology. I also found Patrick Leonardi's ""The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations"" vol 1, vol 2, and vol 3 to have excellent test preparation questions that guided me on the importants points to study (and very helpful for my exams!)."
4,Diva's Concert Album is a Classic,"In 1978, there were still some snide critics who claimed disco singers couldn't really sing; that it was all producers' magic. Donna Summer proved them wrong with the triumphant album, ""Live And More"". Here she sings her greatest hits live,and some surprises like; ""The Way We Were"" and ""I Got it Bad And That Ain't Good."" Also on this album is the studio recording of ""Down Deep Inside""; the theme from the 1977 film ""The Deep"". This song is a slickly polished follow-up to such hits like ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""Could It Be Magic"". The orchestration is lavish and Donna provides a melodic, sexy vocal line. ""Live And More"" is Summer at her concert and studio best."
5,Recomended for all creative minds,A wonderful exploration into the thought and work process of creative artist and his team. Frank Gehry is to architecture what Dale Chihuly is to glass.
1,Nanci WHO?,"I will never buy another Nanci Griffith CD unless it's another ""Other Voices."" All I hear is music on this CD. WHERE is Nanci? What a waste."
5,My all-time favorite album,"There is little praise of this album that I can add to Lester Bangs' perspicacious review more than twenty years ago. John Cale's arrangements are superb and truly experimental without sacrificing any of the songs' lyric potency. In fact, Nico's lyrics are incredible considering English to be her second language and they are a wonderful picture of an emotional state. This is the only album I would describe as truly Gothic, and I would also agree with Bangs in describing it as the most important avant-garde album of the latter half of the twentieth century."
4,Indie... Alt... Grunge... Scrawl...,"After a couple of the songs, the power that is contained within the album has already been unleashed in its entirity... It was since track 1 and youve been so into the music you didnt even notice. After listening to the whole album a couple of times, its easy to see who where the predecesors of great bands like Sleater-Kinney, or rocking out long before PJ Harvey came along.This record is sheer energy...The only downfall is its obscure mood which barely leaves the atmosphere...This album is less refined than ""Nature Film,"" but is certainly a couple of steps beyond it.I recommend it to any Indie, Alt, or classic Grunge fan who doesnt mind a less than great voice that still manages to rock you off your feet."
1,Sounds like a videogame :(,"This music sounds like it was made by robots and not even people. I'll bet they don't even play instruments, just press a few buttons on a computer. There's not even one guitar solo on the entire album! Plus they sing in French. How are everyone supposed to understand them? If you want to hear a band that plays there instruments and actually had awesome guitar solos then you should buy a W.A.S.P. album or a Ratt album. At least you can understand what they are singing!!!"
2,The WORST priest album with Rob Halford,"I was surprised that ""Turbo"" took such a beating with Priest Fans, because ""Defenders Of Faith"" has got to be, by far, the weakest Priest album with RH. The album really fools you by kicking some ass with the first three songs, and then starts to slowly fall apart. The Sentinel and Heads are gonna roll are Mediocre, but passable, but the last four songs on the album are the worst S**t songs that I have heard on a Priest album, and those ballads Judas Priest has no buiness singing. Sure, Ram it Down and Turbo have been bashed, and those albums aren't Great, but slightly above average around the 3 1/2 Stars rating. This One Sucks. Save your money, Get the first three songs (hint-hint) and avoid the rest"
2,Not bad,"I found this when I was searching for an album *by* the Defenders of the Faith -- an alternative blues band, NOT Judas Priest. I had forgotten about this one. Not a bad album if you're into that sort of stuff, but most of us have outgrown it by now."
5,Brilliant! Buy it RIGHT NOW! ..... RIGHT NOW!,"This album, simply put.... THUMPS! Do yourself a favor and listen to ""Some Heads Are Gonna Roll"" at maximum volume. You won't be disapointed!"
3,Still good metal,This album came out in 1984 when Metallica was more popular. Some of the songs on the album are a bit commercial but the twin guitar attack does not disappoint. I think it interesting that Judas Priest didn't really score any hits after the 80's. It is still good meat and potatoes metal.
5,What metal is all about,"There are a thousand different forms of metal. This album represents what metal is all about. Look no further, this is the ultimate hm record."
4,One of their better albums,"Defenders Of The Faith is a solid release from Judas Priest and remains their last strong album. While there isn't anything here as catchy as ""Living After Midnight"" or ""You've Got Another Thing Comin'"", there's nothing bad either. ""The Sentinel"" is the best track on the album while the melodic ""Some Heads Are Gonna Roll"" and the super heavy ""Freewheel Burning"", and the power ballad ""Night Comes Down"" are not far behind. Other songs like ""Love Bites"", ""Jawbreaker"", and ""Eat Me Alive"" are also strong tracks. The metal anthems ""Rock Hard, Ride Free"" and ""Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith"" are okay but don't touch the anthems on their best albums (British Steel, Screaming For Vengeance, Hell Bent For Leather). This would be their last truly strong album as future releases such as Turbo and especially the albums with Ripper Owens would pale in comparison."
3,Priest on a roll!,"Priest releasing another popular metal album, though this one is a bit weaker than screaming for vengence. Still, some classic here. Does have some filler songs like ""heavy duty"" and some others that were popular back then but don't stand up very well today, like ""love bites"" and ""some heads are gonna roll."" 3.5 stars for this one."
3,First two chapters of Harpo Speaks.,"I absolutely adore the book from which this is taken ""Harpo Speaks"" but this is a poor excuse for a book. This book is really just the first 2 chapters of his really well written book. If you have a desire to read about NY and Harpo, buy the full book. It is way better. HARPO SPEAKS"
4,A Family Saga to Remember,"My mother comes from a large Lebanese family that came to the United States in 1916. Cherie's descriptions of Francesca and Eugene sound so much like the stories I heard from my aunts and uncles as I grew up. Her writing is musical, brilliantly descriptive and so moving. Although I knew it was a memoir, it reads like a great work of historical fiction. I felt every blow, every triumph, every heartache right along with these wonderfully drawn characters. I have since sent it on to my mother to read and I know she will pass it on to her sisters."
5,A Loving Memoir,"This book is a heartfelt tribute by a daughter who obviously understood the dreams, frustrations and drive of her beloved father. His love of music,the glue that held Charlie together through the insanity that was his early life, comes through loud and clear, as does his love for his family. While the great musical success he dreamed of always remained just out of reach, he clearly succeeded in creating a family that was bound together with love and respect. The music is , after all, fleeting, but the love remains, and this book is a testament to it."
1,Just Horrible....,Korn is my all time favorite band. I even met them. I was hoping to see a lot of Korn behind the scenes and information on the band on this DVD. This is not what I hoped for at all. It's basically just people talking about how they like Korn.
4,A different kind of war movie,"Director John Ford took big lug John Wayne out of his usual prairie wanderings in this sad, slowly deliberate film about a group of merchant marines eager to make it home, with the shadow of WWII hovering over them, and German U-boats haunting the waters of the Atlantic. It turns out the Germans are less of a menace than their fellow sailors, as Wayne's naive young Swede, Ole Olafson, falls prey to a criminal pack of shanghai-ers in a seedy local tavern. The ever-dependable Thomas Mitchell brings this film its emotional core, playing his old-timer experience beautifully off of the Swede's wide-eyed innocence. Nice flick; not as exciting or robust as other wartime offerings, but complex and emotionally resonant. From a story by Eugene O'Neill."
4,AMAZING,"This will be the second time I purchased this book, as the first one I got was stolen. Whatever you do, do not believe everything that Kreskins writes because he believe himself. He plays the part very well and he will die playing the part of a mentalist with AMAZING powers. The funny thing is that I to do amazing effects that you can purchase at any magic shop! I think I'll go out and see if I can have a UFO land!"
5,Great for my 55 gallon tank!,"I used to haul buckets for water changes and it was such a pain!! No more! I love this gravel vac kit, I have had this gravel vac for a couple of years and no complaints."
2,It fails to be a gravel cleaner.,"I bought this outside of amazon. Now i have to buy a new one with a different brand.It works as a water changer.It fails as a gravel cleaner. If you, like me, try to suck up all the junk at the bottom of the tank, your chances of success is lower than 25%. Some does come up, but after a half tank of water gone at full faucet pressure, you are better off looking elsewhere. The connections on each of its sections are not air tight. This meaning that pressure for suction is low. Especially at the water faucet end, the blue adapter just never stay sealed.Lee's is a great company, I especially love their in tank filters. But this product doesn't work for me. Decide for yourself."
2,Very sloppy paint job-does not spray smoothly,"I wanted to love this little spray paint machine, but I just can't recommend it. No matter how much I thinned the paint, I could not achieve a consistent spray. It was blotchy and drippy and took forever to dry because I watered it down so much. In the time it took to dry of course all kinds of dust got in the paint and made the finish even worse. I think this really needs to be redesigned to work well unfortunately."
1,"Works, but not for long","I bought this mug for my husband for Christmas. We are back at work for the first week now, and I'm already giving this a 1-star review. He started using it on Monday and it broke by Wednesday. There is a screw at the bottom of the mug to keep it on and it broke and now all the electronics keep falling out the bottom of the mug. No dice on getting to return it from the seller as I bought it before Christmas and you only get 14 days to return (if it's still pristine and in the package).I think $24+ is too much to spend on something that MIGHT break after one week. His $8 car plug coffee mugs lasted tons longer and when they died, I felt like he got his money's worth of uses."
4,another CD I missed,Deee-Lite made 3 or 4 CDs and not a lot of remixes... it wasn't until Sampladelic Relics & Dancefloor Oddities that I was made aware of them. `Groove Is In the Heart' is still my favorite... with a lyric or two that I didn't hear before. Love it.
5,"Forget Layla, this is Clapton's best!","It is sort of ironic that most of Clapton's greatest albums are the ones that concentrate more on melody and songwriting rather than extended guitar solos. This is certainly the case with ""461 Ocean Boulevard"", it is relaxed, and most importantly all of Clapton's strengths (great voice, command of the guitar,etc.) are on an incredible display! There are no weak tracks or throwaways here!"
4,"Not his best, but still....","This is a really nice record from Clapton, one of his best, but ""Layla"" is still his most solid work, also the album where he sings best. Could do without ""Steady Rollin' Man"" and ""Mainline Florida"", but some of his best songs ever are here, like ""Give me strength"", ""Let it grow"" and ""Please be with me"". A bit uneven but very good indeed."
1,Disappointed,"I have been a Eric Clapton fan all of my life but I have to say I was very disappointed by this cd,first of all the sound quality is awful and i have to say it is probably the most uninspired playing by Eric that I have ever heard.I believe this should have stayed in the vault.I guess this was one of Eric's low points in his life and you can certainley hear that."
5,461 ocean boulevard,"what impressed me most, was the sound quality of the music on thesacd surround sound. I'd recommend this cd to those who appreciate great sound quality. Thanks Amazon. James"
5,I loved the book!!!,I never knew anyone could tell that so well it was so funny and im still laughing after i read it millions of times
3,Good book - with exceptions,"First I'll admit I love The Daily Show with John Stewart and TiVo it nightly. I enjoyed the book first and foremost for its incredibly interesting take on historical events and the unique narratives. It alternated between very funny, very weird, and kind of dumb. It is a quick read, offers unique glimpses into history, and has its funny moments. I think Stewart can and will do better, but it gets a 3/5 from me because you will be a better person for having read it and you can then sell it back to a half-priced book store."
5,Understanding smart humor...,"Reviews have been written that stress the lack of ""smarts"" in Jon Stewart's humor. To that, I can only comment that it takes a somewhat intelligent person to understand smart humor in the first place. With that being said, Stewart has the audacity to push the limits of what is comdically acceptable and the sense to KISS (keep it simple stupid). As a cold war historian, I particluarly enjoyed ""The Ford Tapes"" and can see how that might have actually happened. If you love The Daily Show, get this book. If you can't read or comprehend what you read, then don't waste your time. I highly recommend this witty book."
2,Very tiny,The product description should have included the measurement of the item. This is very tiny than it appears in the photo.
5,Uh Huh is a big Yes,"Pre-dating his ""Farm Aid"" support of America's Heartland, Mellencamp's ""Uh Huh"" clearly shows the nostalgia and amicable rebellion that pervades his work. From the midwest ode ""Pink Houses"" to the self deprecating ""Authority Song"", Mellencamp continues his ""American Fool"" path of embracing your roots while still having a great time."
4,Pretty happy,This was a good price and the product suits my purpose (infrequent use in soups and drinks) just fine. I'd buy it again.
3,"Great for immersion blending, but nearly a no-go for smoothies.","This blender does its job for the most part, and at a great price.I bought this to replace a blender that was borrowed and broken and didn't want to spend a lot of money, and I certainly got a lot of usage from this at a low cost, but it takes a very long time and lot of hand fatigue to make a smoothie.The blender can't crush ice, and it has trouble grinding through frozen bananas, especially. It also cannot blend up seeds, such as shelled sunflower seeds. If it's left on too long trying to blend a banana or something similar the motor begins to heat up noticeably.It is great for blending soups and such, as there is not the typical hassle of pouring boiling soup into a blender caff, and for inventing salad dressings and sauces. It can make short work of a soymilk and hemp protein shake, so long as there are no frozen obstacles."
4,Better than it should be!,This nice little cheap immersion blender has been absolutely wonderful for me. Despite it's low price it is still of great quality and easily handles everything that I've thrown at it so far.
5,Decent blender for the price,This hand blender is a decent deal for the price. Its not the most powerful blender but works just fine for making protein shakes etc.
5,LONG AWAITED! and WELL WORTH THE WAIT.. WELCOME HOME STEPH!,Welcome Home Stephanie! BORN FOR THIS is LONG AWAITED...SONGS ARE FANTASTIC! Stephanie's voice is BETTER THAN EVER! Her vocal talent shines so bright! Every music fan should have open arms for this release! Ms. Mills just blows the roof off!Congratulations for the new found success......Thanks for blessing us with such a gift!
4,A good immersive story,"I noticed on other reviews the complaints of too many cut scenes. I did not find the cut scenes bothersome at all. Its the story line. If you like first-person shooters this game is not for you. If you like real Role-playing games, this game is great. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Charming!,"I enjoyed Ciao, Professore! very much. It was poignant, charming, and humorous. Coming from an Italian background, I have recommended it to family and friends, especially Italians!"
3,Low sodium--Bull!!,"I utilized the base in a dish that I make mny I messer year and the end product wasa little to salty . Tasting the product reveals thtat it is very salty, so beware!The intensechickrn flavor Is nice. I can't wit o try it with grits.--WLR"
1,be careful,"this item was purchased as part of a baby registry. it was shipped by itself without being placed in another protective box. the wood is so cheap that the corners got banged up during delivery. tried exchanging it for another, but the same thing happened, so returned both. customer service was apologetic but am not going to get it again."
4,Buy this movie,Want to see some girls really ACTING??? These girls go above and beyond while getting some real on-screen DIGITALS!! Thats right you heard it here first. Nice girls and some perfect low budget horror.....A B Movie masterpiece.
5,a brilliant demostration of evil-ution,Looks like the French are on to me. Better move to Brookfield.-God
4,Antidote to ADHD,"Great for restless kids, especially young boys. Fascinating up-close footage of life underground and above. A natural sedative."
5,Why no DVD??,"The preceding reviews say it all - this film is a visual feast, and as soon as I discovered HDTV I went looking for Microcosmos on DVD. I'm very disappointed that it hasn't been transferred yet. I want to show my 4-year-old what bugs are really like; I guess he'll have to see it on VHS."
5,How did they do it?,"I was absolutely mesmerized by this film. I was switching channels and locked onto ""Microcosmos"", didn't know the name until I looked it up! I couldn't even leave it for three minutes to get my morning coffee incase I missed anything. No naration, just stunning photography - ""How did they get that?"" every scene, absolutely breathtaking..... I hope the makers of this ""Documentary"" get some award for brilliance!!!!"
4,Good and cheap,"Honestly I buy this for my poor dog that is allergic to all ingredients in commercial treats (no wheat, etc for him). He's not allergic to rice products so the vet recommends rice cakes and this caseload is a great deal. The only thing is that these are a little thinner (not buy much) and break a little easier than the Quaker oat salt free I'd buy at the grocery store."
4,there is evidence of joy in this cd,"There are 2 songs in this cd in particular that I really adore: ""love song"" & ""doin fine"". However, Ellis' rich voice, clever lyrics, and joy in her laughter is really evident in many of her other songs as well. This cd is different to the 1st cd I bought of Ellis' (Break the Spell) in that there are many live recordings."
4,ANIME and DRIFTING 4 1/2 STARS !!!!,Three stars come on??? where you get that from if you know anything about racing you know this is the best Animated driving version of drifting available to us in the US. As far as Japans version goes it's on the disc too... So give TokyoPop some props for bringing it here... I know a tight Anime and this one is just that and I know cars as well and they were well drawn to specs in the vids. as well as the driving technique used... So if your into the scene with a ride you'll like it a lot or if you're playing video games still you'll wish to drive one of those rides...
3,Different from the original,"I saw a Hong Kong version of the series some time ago. It was Japanese sound track and English sub-title. I really like the show. Once I started, I couldn't stop, and ended up spending the entire weekend watching all the episodes and the movies. I felt the urge to go buy a little Japanese pocket racer after watching the show.However, I was surprised by the changes Tokyopop made to the US version. I can't decide it's better or worse, but it is different. The music is different (I didn't like it) and some of the races were modified. Some of the English tranlation are different. I guess Tokyopop tried to westernize the show for the US viewers.Overall, Initial D is a great show. I highly recommend. But I prefer the Hong Kong version better."
5,"Iggy is not stupid, neither/nor the def riffs on this album.",Stooges were not stupid at this point of approaching the west coast. They could pack a few houses with their def riffage; math.
2,Affirmation of existence,"I drove down my street while enjoying the delicate taste of a Parliament Light, I listened to this album, and I almost drove off the road and off of a cliff that led into a cavern of never-before seen or understood musically delirious pleasure. To call this house of Stooges ""fun"" is like calling hunger a symptom of fatigue. To say the least, in this album Iggy presents an ultimatum to existence. Either you remain a futile specimen of audio simplicity, or you fall backward onto a bed of nails that hold a fantastically psychadelic elicxer of auditory sensuality."
4,Loved the feel of the music...,"After first seeing the trailer for Staying Alive I immediately was drawn into the music. Of course Saturday Night Fever was great, but this was even better, musically. The main theme and especially Cynthia Rhodes singing ""Finding Out the Hard Way"" - I can listen to that over and over and still be moved - are my favorites. Don't be mislead by poor movie reviews - the music is great! (By the way, I'm actually writing this review 20 years after the movie and soundtrack were released but just watched the movie again and was reminded of how great the music is.)"
4,A great story,"This book was excellent. It is the greatest story every told to all Christians. However, midway into the book, the author lets his dislike of Catholic beliefs spoil the book. Only a few were mentioned and this book would have been beautifully written without the bias. It's still worth buying and it's still very informative, just overlook the anti-Catholic notes."
1,Best thing about it was the title...,"If you are a fan of film noir, bad parodies, puns, and dirty jokes, this may be the book for you. But if you're looking for a well-written and fun book that lived up to its title, you're going to be sadly disappointed. The book features characters with names like Vagina Dentata and Custard Nipplewait. It also features the main character jacking off at every opportunity, in a variety of ways. While the ""voice"" of the novel was very clear and boasted a cool film noir flair, the book was just too lowbrow to be remotely satisfying in the end."
2,Wingman by Mack Maloney,"I haven't read any of Maloney's other books but I was not overly impressed with this one and I've read many genres. This one is about fictional post war occurances of a conflict between the US and the USSR. While I may have MAY have enjoyed this book as a teenager, when the Soviet Union still formally existed, I'm under whelmed by the literary impression I got. There is too much good stuff out there these days to spend more than a couple hours reading this one even if you're into fantasy, war fiction."
2,Cheap slide design,"Item works as it should, but the slide stem is a poor design and breaks easily. I am going with another product now."
3,FAN OF KRYSTEE,"All though this little film smells alot like ""HOME ALONE"" it's pretty good for a family film. i basicaly liked all the characters (exept STU STEWART and ""THE TRACKER"") I had a bit of a problem with some of the language though. And of course i fell compleately in love with KRYSTEE CLARK (CHELSEA STUART). KRYSTEE is EXTREAMLY cute! and EXTREAMLY under rated as an acteress. but was a fine choice for the role. She had very good chemistry with BRADY BLUHMS character (JUSTINE). So, yeah, get a copy of this film and watch it with your kids. espesialy around thanks giveing."
4,Excelent content a thinkness,"I would like recomend the reading of this book to everybody who realy wants to learn Java Programming, it is very consice and usefull."
3,"Interesting Read, but Overwhelmingly Feminist at Times","Enloe's book is fascinating and I enjoyed reading it. Unlike some other feminist authors, she uses concrete examples based in reality and includes entertaining (and relevant) vignettes. A few times, she ventures a bit too far into the vast abyss of hyper-feminism (one example: drawing direct parallels between the shape of bananas and the phallus in light of banana plantations that indeed did exploit and discriminate against women). Overall, though, Enloe is down to earth and blends minimal amounts of theory with reality. I would recommend the book to others."
4,A must-own for garage rock fans,"Given when this album came out, it must have been way out of left field for it's time. Not as great as the following two albums Funhouse and Raw Power, but the hints of future greatness are definitely there. This album is worth it just for the song ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and ""1969"" alone. Buy this album."
1,"It says 12"" but it was probably measured by a man.","I installed this pump level to the BOTTOM of my fuel tank, up front. It says to install within 12"" of bottom HEIGHT. Doesn't mention distance from tank. I figured that it should be fine. Nope!! This thing has problems with being on a hill. If you have to park on the slightest incline be prepared to roll, push or winch to get pointed downhill so the pump primes itself. This also needs to be mounted on rubber feet because if it runs dry, from sitting on an incline, it literally sounds as though a tiny jackhammer is pounding on your vehicle. Trust me, it's loud and takes forever to prime itself, provided you're pointing downhill!"
4,A great book for new knitters,"As a knitting instructor, I think this is a great book for new knitters. The patterns are good basic patterns and they walk you through a lot of the steps to putting a good sweater together. Several of my students have made sweaters from this book and have been very happy with them. I think it's a great book for those knitters who are starting out or a seasoned knitter who would like a quick project.My only complaint about the book is that the yarns are all chunky and the lasting quality of the book may not last when the big yarns are no longer all the rage."
4,Love it!,"I love this book! I really liked the selection of tank tops. I live in a warm climate and most sweater patterns are designed for cold climates. I did find the yarns used rather expensive, but I have not had a problem substituting. The patterns are clearly written and easy to follow. I also really liked that the gauge was given not just for the typical 4"" swatch, but also per inch. This made it easier to find substitution yarns. I liked the format, which broke the book into sweater types. The sweaters in each section are similar, but different enough to keep things interesting. It has greatly helped my confidence as a new knitter. I could complete the sweaters without frustration and a million questions. Keep up the good work Yarn Girls!"
5,The very best book to learn to knit your first sweater (and beyond)!,"After years of frustration and confusion, I finally turned the corner with this book -- and I have the knitted sweater(s) to prove it. So many 'learn-to-knit' authors are unable to take on the mindset of a complete beginner, but these women have somehow accomplished the task. They literally take you row by row from beginning to end of a project. This is especially important when it comes to shaping a garment. Although there were some errors in the early editions, corrections were on the website. Projects are both hip and classic, nothing fussy or over-the-top. For someone who loves to work with multicolored yarns, the patterns are perfect and will be used for years to come. Way to go, Yarn Girls!!"
4,Expensive yarns....good patterns,"This is a great book, with one slight problem--the yarns are quite expensive. I found an easy sweater that was gorgeous. Then I found out the yarn is $20 a ball and you'd need 8 of them. $160 for a beginner sweater. AND not washable. So, you'll need to know how to substitute yarn well. There are VERY good illustrations at the beginning and I do enjoy the patterns. Just be prepared for expensive yarn recommendations."
4,Totally absorbing.,"This is one of the scariest books I have ever read. No blood and guts, just plain excellent writing. For anyone considering participation in a seance, please read this first. Lots of good, scary fun."
5,Exact light for the one I was replacing,This was the perfect match to the previous light I had which needed replacing. I just had to take down the old one and replace it with the new one! Thanks! It works great underneath my kitchen cabinets.
3,An Uneven Film,"There are some aspects of this film that were outstanding. The wrestling scenes are the most realistic I've viewed in a movie. The movie gives a good account of the sacrifices it takes to be an accomplished athlete. Finally, Jimi Petulla's performance as the father and coach is very touching and memorable.However, other aspects of the movie seem to be right out of an ABC Afternoon Special. Danny Mousetis's role as the son was unconvincing. I don't want to give away scenes but the son seemed much too mature, much too good, for a conflicted 17 year old. It appears that the film writers wanted to create a likeable character but in doing so, left something important out. Other characters, especially the mother, seemed flat - as if little thought was given to develop their character. There were some scenes that I thought I've seen right out of the Afternoon Special."
2,"Sorry, didn't like it","That this is self-published and presented in computer typeface is somewhat off-putting, but inaccurate piloting scenes and two dimentional characters are just too much. This is Junior College creative writing at best. Couldn't wait to sell or give away the book."
1,"Umm, really?","Someone please help me understand how this guy was able to get this depressing dribble released to the general population? This could be the WORST music I have ever heard in my entire life. I have a fairly extensive CD collection that ranks in the thousands with exposure to lots of different musical styles. Please take a close listen to the samples before buying this garbage. Coldplay and Radiohead should NOT be compared to this trash. Additionally, if you are tired of being a generally happy person and want to mess that up play this album."
4,Buckleys Best,"This was the transition album for Buckley from folk protest type gig--to the mixing of folk jazz rock hybrid that he single handledly invented and perfected. At times he failed miserably but when he succeeded the results were amongst the best music of the 20th century. Standout tracks here are ""Love From Room 109 At the Islander(On Pacific Coast highway) gotta love that title and ""Strange Feeling"". This record would lead to the ill fated ""lorca"" that distanced Buckley even further from the rock mainstream and an audience for that mattter. Get this now along with the 'Live In London"" double CD and experience what many have missed--one of the most haunting voices ever committed to vinyl."
2,No noticeable effect,"I can't say whether this product really works or not. I did not notice anything different while taking it. For that reason, I would not purchase again."
1,I hate this CD,"For me, the volume changes make it unlistenable. It feels to me like a very easy idea, to have a violin play such long tones & then suddenly have tons of loud noise burst from the orchestra & then have the quiet long tones again. I have to turn up the volume so high to hear that violin, & then the sudden very loud noise is way too loud. I guess this is music to listen to if you don't want to be able to focus on anything else maybe."
1,This is not the Mac version,"These games have been rewritten for the Mac OSX platform, but this is not it. This is the old windows XP / Mac OS 8-9 version that will not run on any current mac."
3,Not very pratical item,"I bought this briefcase thinking Travelpro would give me the best in class roller but got highly disapointed. The handle broke and I had to repair locally, some of the zippers started to wear out and I had to pay more attention to avoid putting too many things in that compartment.From the reviews I've checked in Amazon, there are definitely better products."
3,"Cheap quality, but worked for Halloween","I got these for a Cheshire Cat costume for Halloween. They lasted for about two nights, then tore too much to wear anymore. Very thin tights, not great quality. But, they lasted for how long I needed them."
2,It's ok,"Like many other customers who reviewed this book, I have to say that this book does have a lot of mistakes in every section, however for the PAT section it will definatly help you out by giving you some good info on how to do well, but as I mentioned before when you'll be doing one book's test be prepared in getting a lot of ""wrong"" answers do to the lots of mistakes in the book."
4,Good Value,"This book has faults (sample exam errors, etc.) that have been abundantly pointed out by other reviewers, but the hints for the PAT are worth the money alone. I found the PAT on the DAT to be more difficult than some other prep products's sample tests would have you believe (Although, I did score well on the PAT). This book alone takes a methodical approach to finding the right answer, but also getting it fast, which was my problem. The science review sections were not as complete as some other books, but I found many of the explanations helpful in clarifying things that I had never learned well in my prereq classes, especially in the O Chem section, where the idea of using acid and base chemistry to solve problems was emphasized in a very helpful way. I would not recommend using this as your only review material, but in conjunction with TopScore Pro and my textbooks, etc., it helped me get very good scores on all sections of the DAT."
2,It's OK but not up to date and many wrong answers,"I just took the DAT and used this book in conjunction with others. It is ok for the Science sections, however the reading comp section is not representative of what is on the actual test. The passages on the real test are not all about Dentistry. There are also plenty of errors in the PAT section. I would recommend the coursework from Kaplan. I would also recommend the KSF review since their questions are somewhat representative of what the actual exam covers. Also they have modified the 2007 exam questions a bit so do be shocked when you see them."
4,"Paralegal textbook - (2005 ed.),","PARALEGAL TEXTBOOK (2005 ED.) - SOME IMPORTANT INFO REQUIRED FOR CLASS NOT IN THIS EDITION RELATING TO ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION/ INTERNET, ETC. BOOK MAY STILL BE USED FOR ALL OTHER LESSONS IN CLASS."
4,4-H Prize for Member with Autism,This was a great incentive for our 4-H group. Prizes are displayed each meeting during contests. Our autistic wonder just happened to LOVe Garfield and win him to take home! Highly recommend for 4-H groups ages 8 and up!!
4,Dreamy with a reality check,"Really good performance from Sheedy and entire cast, and a great story too. Definitely worth viewing for anyone interested in viewing a character sketch of a burned out lesbian photographer with a drug problem and the sexual identity questioning young neophyte who falls in love with her for her talent as much as her self. Strong recommendation, with a single negative comment regarding the shallow portrayal of the heterosexual relationship, which lacked any complexity. Then again, the homosexual relationships weren't healthy, so perhaps this was part of a greater theme."
3,Patricia Clarkson =3 Stars,"i found this to be another movie about lesbians in tank tops, HOWEVER PATRICIA CLARKSON is probably one of the most brillaint and beautiful actors around. she gets 3 stars. the movie gets 1 1/2"
5,Nothing Really New To Say...,"...but felt the need to leave another 5 Star review for this sometimes under-appreciated uber-record. There aren't a whole lot of albums these days that can transport you, mood-driven thematic tunes that when you really pay attention and listen to them they're way more than just background noise. These tunes rock, sweeping lyrics, a pounding rhythm section (Tony on bass and Mark on drums, in my humble opinion, can go up against anyone in the biz and hold their own nicely) and Bruce makes a guitar do a bagpipe impression. Um, yup, you bet, cool!You don't have to be in your late 30s/early 40s to dig this stuff, don't buy the ""one-hit wonder"" rubbish, one hit that hit the radio maybe but certainly an un-do tag for this marvelous band and timeless record."
4,best outing,"As I listen to their first 1983 release, I really wish this band would have lived up to their potential. Their other works never possessed the same chemistry. This cd contains their best work. ""Fields of Fire"" and ""In a Big Country"" were their radio hits, but if you listen to the whole collection, you will hear some other gems. ""1000 Stars"" and ""Inwards"" are equally as good. The unique bagpipe guitar sound of the band can be heard in nearly all of the tunes. It is refreshing to hear a band play the blue collar sounds of rock 'n' roll. The career of Big Country does contain some good tunes, but just couldn't put a compilation of songs like this one. If your are looking for some songs different from their greatest hits collection, I recommend this one."
3,Has A Sound All It's Own.,"I've had this CD for a handful of years. I've never listened to it very much, but there's no doubt that Big Country sounded like nobody but themselves. This album was released when New Wave was very popular, but The Crossing doesn't follow that formula. Their use of guitars and how they sound is very different and interesting. I've never been a fan of Big Country really, but I do think ""In a Big Country"" and ""Chance"" are good songs. The rest of the songs are pretty good. This isn't a bad release."
5,Big Country's masterpiece,"This is a great album. Big Country has its own sound and its own style with clucking guitars, pattering drums, and lush, dreamy lyrics. And with that style they create their own poppy songs, like ""Inwards"" and ""1000 Stars,"" as well as epics like ""The Storm"" and ""Porrohman."" What can I say: it's brilliant. Repeated listenings make me sad that they couldn't hold onto that sound in later releases. This is Big Country at their beginning, and at their peak."
3,Good pump!,"As products like these are not commercially available in Aus, I purchase this pump on here and it definitely makes water changes a lot easier! You may have to buy parts for it though, but that's no hassle. The python pumps will not ship to Australia, however from what I have heard this pump (which is cheaper) is just as good!Only issue is that I have had a few broken parts needing replacing, and it is not as sturdy as some other pumps out there, however for it's price I would definitely recommend it!"
4,good product,"good product that charges my ipod nano and transfers the files to my nano. the quality is not as high as the original ipod cable, but this gets the job done and provides additional cable length."
5,A movie that makes you feel good about being you!,"This movie was one i remember from the 80's as one of the best of the decade. Sheila McCarthy is wonderful as the introverted and unintentionally funny Polly, who wants to be recognied as a world famous photographer.Its a shame its not available, and would gladly pay any reasonable price to own it."
3,Oh those 70's memories,"Uriah Heep was one of those prog rock outfits that aspired to the popularity of groups like Yes. Bombastic multi-layered vocals, keyboards, fantasy lyrics, even cover art work by the same artist responsible for Yes covers. This album was really their peak musically and in popularity. I had about worn out the grooves on my vinyl LP back in the 70's and I doubt I would have bought the CD had it not been on sale but it sure did bring back some memories."
1,Classic British 70s Rock,"Another early 70s album and my favourite from the prolific Uriah Heep, from the end of their early period. This was one of the underestimated English rock bands of the 70s, never very popular beyond England and... Eastern Europe. Contains the classic Easy Livin' and the haunting The Wizard and Rainbow Demon (all Ken Hensley compositions). If you like this album, also check out the follow-up The Magicians Birthday. No 70s rock collection should be without them."
2,"Demonic Yes, But Where Were The Wizards?","Well, this group made it, the Rolling Stone critic didn't commit suicide, but as a monument to bad taste Uriah Heep was in a league of its own. At the least, it could brag about having about the lead singer with the most annoying over-the-register scream this side of Steven Tyler and the ""guiding force"" who could and did prove there was no limit to delusions of rock grandeur. That this was actually considered a coming-of-age album for a band who ""finally"" found the right rhythm section (just what WAS so right about a meandering bassist and a drummer who couldn't cut a proper groove with a meat cleaver but had about the most ham-and-clubfooted style this side of Carmine Appice) testifies to how easily even the sensible get fooled. About this album, it is said best that the cover art (Roger Dean) was as memorable as the music was (and remains) irredeemably ugly. You want redeemable ugly, take a ride on Grand Funk Railroad."
1,"wrong picture, beware!!","Exactly ""This Case is is not oval as indicated in the picture but small and round."" Forgot to read the review and received a wrong case, too small and you can't put anything in it. (shipped out model EA628 instead of EA625)."
4,"Not a powerhouse, but good for a variety of occasions.","Guerlain's men's offerings have stood the test of time. While L'Instant is more subtle than some of the house's other fragrances, L'Instant has broad appeal. For the price, this is a good bet that is versatile enough for day and evening wear in all seasons. I don't think people will necessarily remember you by this fragrance, but you will smell sophisticated and chic wearing it! Sillage and longevity are decent considering the low price point. L'Instant won't set the world on fire, but it fits the bill if you're looking for a very affordable, elegant scent."
2,Where was the parental advisory?,"I liked the first disc just fine. Like many others I wondered why ""It's the End of the World..."" wasn't included, but I enjoyed listening to it. I made the mistake of listening to the second disc for the first (and only time) with my small children in the car. I couldn't believe it when I heard the F-word coming out of the speakers of my car. Even without the profanity that ""song"" sounded horrible. I was so offended that I haven't even listened to the first CD since."
1,What no shiny happy people?,"But they do have ""Stand""!!! Wow, great stuff! ""Everybody Hurts"" after listening to this. I know some of you are miffed about the track selection, but it is very difficult to pick their best. It's like picking the corn and peanuts out of a steaming loaf."
3,Poor recording of classic REM,"Love the music. Hate the recording quality. It hurts my ears. I've read the same comment in a review of another REM re-release. From memory I think the reviewer said he started off by turning the music down then turning it off. That's exactly how I feel. I not sure what's happening. On my system I normally listen at around the 30 out of 60 mark. When I received this CD I started my listening at that level, then I had to turn it down to 20 and then, after 6 tracks, I turned it off. That's all I could take. I've tried listening to it a second and third time but it gets me the same way every time. I have a reasonable system (I use a CEC TL1 as the source). Most CD's sound pretty good (even some of the cheap compilations from the discount shops), some excellent, but this is just awful. REM should be ashamed of the quality of this release.Jane"
4,REM - Really Exceptional Music,"Put this CD on and play from start to finish. The disc features all of the popular hits played on the radio and many ""hits"" that are reallly more like the best of the best from their many releases. Nice addition to my collection and a good choice for any REM fan."
2,"Some good songs, but best of a weak era","After glancing at the song list on this while listening to Eponymous I realized how REM was really at their best much earlier on. Skip this and instead pick up Eponymous, Green, and Automatic for the People. From there, dabble in the pre-Eponymous releases and enjoy the true ""best of"" REM."
2,"Great group, partial collection",I would have claimed this was a must have disc until a new greatest hits was released and is far more complete. Still great music from a very good band.
3,"""In my day we had only Eponymous -- and we were happy!""","Yeah, I guess I sound like a curmudgeonly old skool REM fan. For me, there's very little in their post-Document repertoire that has the same impact as any track off their earlier albums. So there's little in this collection that I would enjoy listening too more than once.Anyway, if you do like later-stage REM, this is probably a great collection to have -- a cursory glance at the favorable ratings here seems to confirm this. But if you're looking for more, and are unaware of such gems as ""Talk About the Passion"" (Murmur) or ""So. Central Rain"" (Reckoning), give the earlier REM an ear, too."
1,This is Supermarket Musak,"Greatest Hits and it doesn't have ""End of the World As We Know It""? Well no big deal since these guys aren't half as good as they think they are anyway. I see they added the completely lame ""Everybody Hurts"" to the set list. Michael Stipe's whining makes William Hung sound like butter."
1,If this is the best....,"This is a bizarre ""best of"" album. I'm a fan so I bought it, but 80% of the tracks are throw aways. It's a bad meal you pick thru looking for one good morsel."
3,Hits and misses,"Like all compilations, this recent BEST OF REM CD features a mix of hits and misses ... and two new songs (all artists seem to do this now). Some of the classics included are ""The Great Beyond"", ""Orange Crush"" and ""Stand"". Obvious exclusions are ""Drive"", ""Happy Shiney People"" and ""The End of the World"". When the CD was first released, Michael Snipe announced that ""Happy Shiney People"" was no longer a band favourite and for that reason it was excluded. This CD is a great place to start if you are new to REM becuase it does capture a great portion of their later classics. But if you want to go one step further, you really should purchase the wonderful ""Automatic for the People"" which is thier finest album. It is almost a greatest hits in itself."
4,In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003,"In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003 being REM's second official compilation album and was received well by the critics. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave it 4 stars and I agree with them. Here we get great tracks such as ""Man on the moon"", ""Orange Crush"" and ""What's the frequency Kenneth?"" and so many more. The booklet has great liner notes written by Peter Buck and a ton of photographs taken during the years 1988-2003. 4/5."
5,Attention Catcher,"I enjoyed the book. After reading feedback I was scared to buy it becasue I thought it would have alot of homosexual scenes, but it didn't have not one and the book was very good. I recommend it, the ending will blow you away."
3,Good Condition but Bad delivery,The price I got for the book was great! I thought this deal was too good to be true. The book came perfectly. No rips or tears. The only problem I had that was annoying was the fact that I didn't get my book until like 3 weeks when the delivery was supposed to have come way before that. I got frustrated but other than that it was good. Just make sure to order ahead of time because they don't ship it within the time they said or you won't get it when you're suppose to get it.
3,Aimed at conducting Korean business,"This book is okay if you would like to learn Korean for business and are already familiar with the basics of Korean. It attempts to teach you the basics of Korean grammar while teaching you conversation that is relevant to business. I think it is too fast paced for a true beginner, and is more appropriate for an advanced beginner. The book comes with exercises, and answers on the back, as a well as CD which are all helpful for individuals learning Korean on their own. The male speaker on the CD does not sound like a native Korean speaker, but his speech is still good and may actually be easier for non-native speakers to understand. I give it 3 starts instead of 4 because I would have liked to have seen 2 more chapters in the beginning about basic Korean grammar, with shorter, easier conversations about non-business topics like family."
2,First 20+ pages missing,"Open the cover and the first page you find is page 21 - somewhere close to the end of the first chapter. No intro, no TOC, and so on. Flipped through the whole book - it's not a matter of the pages being out of order - they are just plain missing."
3,good product but may be cheaper locally,love it but check your local store as they may have a better price...amazon has raised them over $30 recently
1,Not Good,"Super cheesy, sub-standard lounge music. Really bad. Take my word; save yourself some time and avoid this."
3,Worked Well...for a few months.,"I got this for my photo classed and used it many times over a year. Never had any problems with leaks and my negatives always came out fine. However, once the round rubber seal comes out or gets loose, you will experience leaks. Mine came out toward the end of my time using this and I had issues with the chemicals leaking out. A few of my negatives also didn't come out quite right but I'm not exactly sure if that was because of this tank or something else."
1,"Famous ""Lens Cap"" Error","I recorded about 5 tapes in this unit and now I get the famous ""Lens Cap"" error that seems to plague JVC Camcorders. It will record audio, but no video. This Camera is not on the JVC repair list. What a piece of junk.Customer Support is a mis-nomer with JVC. They know they have a problem, but refuse to even listen. Do not buy a JVC camcorder."
1,Never Recieved - Got Refund,"After waiting several weeks for this item I checked the UPS tracking system and learned that the product was damaged in a train derailment. I emailed back to Amazon and was told they would look into it. A couple of weeks after that I finally got a refund (after I'd had to pay interest on my credit card, of course.) And to top it off, Amazon keeps asking me to review the product, which is kind of pissing me off, really. I'm happy that the issue was resolved, but upset that I had to be the one to initiate the communication to get it resolved. Having said that, I would still shop from Amazon in the future."
5,cool very good her music is always a challenge to me,I like Reba's music and it is very interesting. Some of her music I can really relate to.I think she is awesome and very talented. Keep up with the good work.
3,"I liked it, I laughed, I would not want her in MY house!","This book was irresistible to me. I have given it as a gift and I received it as a gift. I could not help laughing out loud in many places and the author sounds like she could be one of my friends. On the other hand, she scares me off because she seems to be so mean about her clients messy lives! Shouldn't there be some code of honor among housecleaners that they don't wipe and tell?"
2,No Dirt Here,"I'm not sure what this book is supposed to be -- a tell-all? An exploration of the history of cleaning and its place in western culture? A treatise about the underclass? I think part of the problem is that the author herself is not sure where she is, in the metaphysical sense. I couldn't tell why she was a cleaner. If she liked it. Even where she lived! And as far as ""other people's dirt,"" there was precious little here. Not at all what I expected. I was more than a little annoyed at the curious tone the book took towards the idea that those who hire cleaners are somehow exploiting them... Very confusing. I was looking for an author who was going to dish some dirt and instead got an earful about Marxist theory."
4,Inspirational!,"I found this book inspirational! What greater incentive could you have to clean your house, and keep it tidy then listening to the complaints of a professional maid... I loved it.I bought it on cassette and play it while I clean the house! :)"
2,"Nice scare, but unnecessary actions","Saul's book was a pretty good horror story and it was easy to read, the only problem that really caught my attention was the sacrifice/murder of animals. I am sure that it adds a strange light and twist to the story but I am very offended by the needless graphic killings of the pets, and do not wish to read another book by Saul if this is the type of vision he saught. It is one thing to kill an animal by mentioning it's death, but another to massacre it with words when it is completely unnecessary!"
5,One of Saul's Best,I thoroughly enjoyed this tale. It kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to determine what twists the plot would take. Who is crazy? Who's possessed? What happened and why now? The atmosphere of this book was delicious. Curl up with it on a dark and stormy night!
3,Not his best work,"This is a good read unless you are an old John Saul fan and started out reading SUFFER THE CHILDREN, by far and away his best work. This storyline is no where near its equal, but still a page-turning thriller."
2,A Disappointment!!!,I was so disappointed by this book. I am a Saul fan and this book was just boring. The characters had no depth and the ending was to simplistic. It had a build up then ended in like 60 seconds.
3,"Ok, so he isn't Stephen King...","I actually found this book quite enjoyable. I haven't read a horror for a while now & this was a perfect one to get me started again. Ok, so John Saul can't do horror like Stephen King but I disagree with many of the reviews about this book. I liked the fact it was in a small town with a secret and the newcomers have to find out what it is etc. The story made perfect sense to me & it wasn't at all difficult following where it was all leading up to.I have never read a John Saul book, but I quite liked this one, it kept me riveted right until the end...I will be going out and getting another one..For all of you who have never heard of John Saul or read anything of his (like me), pick this one up, it is a good read!"
2,Not up to the usual Saul's standard,"I bought this book just after its release, never mind that the rating was quite bad. After reading the book, I really regret buying it.The characters are too shallow and the plot is quite a mess. I still do not understand why the evil force only look for the males in the family. The dreams were confusing and led readers away from the plot. Hope the next John Saul's book is better.Those who are considering the purchase of this book, please do re-consider."
3,"Good, but not great","The story was very understandable. Characters were each very original and led different paths and played different types of roles that contributed to the fear factor of the plot. The setting was very eerie. The house lived in was also just about living. What upsetted me was the ending. Maybe to some it would sound good, but to me it was sorta lame. Also, the book was pretty comparable to ""The Shining"" by ""Steven King"". I would recommend this book to those who haven't read that book."
1,A Big Disappointment,"No matter how much I try to like John Saul books, and I've spent plenty of money on them over the years, there is just a twisted, almost perverse quality to them that just prevents me from truly enjoying them. I swear that ""The Right Hand of Evil"" will be my last Saul purchase. There is a definite formula in his writing that holds true again to this book - thus, for someone who has read any of his other work, the result is a very predictable tale. I did not find any of the characters to be sympathetic, and didn't care what happened to them by the end of the book. In fact, it would have been a refreshing change if the whole pathetic Conway family had been killed off by a mob of angry townspeople brandishing torches and pitchforks. My advice: save your money."
3,NO GO!,Not what it appeared to be! No detail. Smaller than I thought. Delivered as promised. It was a gift. My grandson was really disappointed!
1,"I could only read 1/3, very boring!","I have read most of John Sanfords books.There was no Lucas Davenport, whom I greatly missed, in this book.I was surprised that I simply could not muddle through this book. I usually devour his books, and, just hate it when the end of the book is near."
3,"Anna, The Night Crew",I love the Lucas Davenport series but found the intrduction to Anna Batary interesting. The action moved along nicely and I liked Anna. My disappointments are the too facile romance between Anna and Jake and the introduction of Anna's ex as some mystery monster from whom she cannot completely separate. I look forward to the next in the series to determine whether the new characters will work on a long term basis.
4,"Good for soups, but salty--it's NOT concentrated stock","This is indeed better than bouillon--as we all know, that's not saying jack, but it's a truly decent product. The beef flavor is definitely nice and rich, but you should taste everything you add this to as you add it so you don't throw off the salt levels. This stuff is sal-tee, with a capital salty. On the other hand, it keeps forever, and the flavor is perfect. It would just be nice to be able to make the beef flavor a little stronger without turning your soup or stew into a brine, and the amount of salt in this stuff makes it hard to find a good balance."
2,"Some beef flavor, tons of salt","Since Amazon didn't post the nutritional value of this product, here it is, straight from the back of the label:Serving size - one teaspoon (6 gm):Calories - 10Total fat - 0.5 gmSodium - 710 mgTotal carbohydrate - 1 gmProtein - 1 gmThe numbers do not begin to give you an idea of just how salty this stuff is! If you put a small sample in your mouth, you can feel and taste the individual salt grains.I looked on the back of a can of Morton salt - 1.5 gm of Morton iodized salt has 590 mg of Sodium, which comes down to 393.33 mg of Sodium per 1 gm of table salt.Which means that this ""Better than Bouillon"" Beef flavor has 1.8 gm of table salt per 6 gm (teaspoon) serving size, which means that SALT is the single largest ingredient in this product.The beef flavor is pretty decent, but it is just overwhelmed by the salt.Sorry, but for people that can't take or don't like so much salt in their diet, this stuff won't work."
4,Eldest,"My book, Eldest, is about a boy named Eragon and his dragon Saphira. His life is in a land called Alagaesia. Eragon is a dragon rider who is one of the few dragon riders left. All Eragon did was train at the elven homeland, express his true feelings for an elf girl called Arya, and battle at the Burning Plains which was a war and I won't tell you who won. Like Eragon, I have traveled distances that aren't too big, but are fair sized. My opinion on the book is that it is a fantastic story, but I don't like how they switch story lines between Eragon and the leader of the Varden whose name I won't tell you. Also it can get confusing if you don't pay attention. I would recommend this book to people who like action and adventure."
4,A nice follow up to Eragon,"In general, I found this book highly enjoyable. However, my complaints are that 1)characters in fantasy novels should not say ""okay,"" and 2) that Arya, the prominent woman in the novel, is a very two-dimensional character."
3,easy read again?,I READ ALOT. THIS BOOK WAS AN OKAY READ BUT I KEPT SWEARING I HAD READ IT BEFORE SOMEWHERE. I REALIZED I COULDN'T HAVE BUT HAVE BEEN LOOKING THROUGH MY LIBRARY ANYWAY. DOES ANYONE RECOGNIZE THIS STORY? I KNEW STUFF THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WAY BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE. NOT JUST A SMALL PART- BUT JUST ABOUT 80% OF THE BOOK. WEIRD.
4,I liked it. Stop Hating.,"I liked the book alot. And sure, at some points during the middle, you wanted something to hurry up and happen(as what happens with MOST fantasy sequels), but it was a great book nonetheless. For some reason I didn't really enjoy reading Roran's narrative, but Eragon's journey through the book made up for that.The end left you wanting more and the plot twist was a great surprise.I say its a good book."
1,100% Pure Garbage,"Why any one would buy ""Eldest"" is beyond me. My kid brother was embarrassed to be seen with this book. He didn't want any of his friends to think he was an idiot for reading it.I returned it to the bookstore for him, and I was the one embarrassed when I was standing in line to return it. The lady in front saw what I was holding and starting laughing out loud saying something about how pretty pictures on the cover don't make a book good and I ought to know it by now.Got me thinking and I opened the book and started reading. Long story short, I got out of line to read, got through the first three chapters. Is this book like a car wreck where everyone slows down to look? It's laughably bad so it can't possibly be selling on its merits.I find it hard to believe there are people any where who think this is good writing."
3,Derivative and luke warm,"I agree with the reviews stating the derivative nature of Paolini's writing. It is evident. Both books Eragon and Eldest were fun, but not awe inspiring. What I don't understand is the almost hateful nature of the reviews. He was and is a kid, cut the guy a break. Sheesh. Its not like he is running for president or something."
2,Not that good...,"Nearly nothing happened in this book. All the minute details of uninteresting events were crammed into this book, and even the huge final battle was shockingly boring. Also, I can't help but notice how this book is basically a mix of ""Dragon Flight"" by Ann McCaffery and ""Lord of the Rings"". Not a real noteworthy book in my opinion. I was extremely dissappointed."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"So tiring seeing people praise these books because they're written by a kid. Christopher Paolini was 19 when Eragon was published and is 22 now. There's no way in the world anyone should still be excusing his age for sloppy writing. Most of the time while reading I wanted to pull my hair out. Stupid, stupid, stupid."
1,I HAVE WASTED IRREPLACEABLE TIME READING THIS PUBLISHED GARBAGE,"I know I'm wasting time and effort criticizing this 'magical' half-baked pulp fiction, but young 'literate' readers need to know the TRUTH. We already know that the only dazzling maneuver that this authors plot structure is efficient at is at plagiarizing from other efficient fantasy plot structures...WE ALL KNOW THIS, secretly, if not obviously. From the LOTR's trilogy to the original StarWars trilogy, this book bites at them ruthlessly.Must I summarize another trite mediocre device of ChristopherPlagiarilini's masterwork. NO! I refuse to. Let the illiterateread this book, because it's not literature...it's dragon crap with a campy formulaic draw out. IN SHORT, the ELDEST is going to get OLD, and is going to INHERIT nothing from real fantasy-literature's WILL.THERE, I've wasted enough time on this ephemeral GARBAGE!"
1,WHAT IS THIS CRAP?!!,I absolutely loved the first book Eragon. I wasn't a star wars fan so I didn't notice the similarities really. Then I waited in eager anticipation for Eldest which meant going bookstore to bookstore looking for a copy/party. What a Ripoff! Most of the book consists of Eragon walks with troll. He walks in desert. He trains with jolly old elf rider who didn't exist in the last book. Rowan (his cousin) falls in love with the butcher's daughter. They love each other. The Razac come and attack. They are after Eragon (well duh) the villagers hold out. The villagers take the same path Eragon did in the last book. Big battle dark family secret. Oh yeah that blessed kid is back. Just skip to the last chapter or so and wait for the final book in the Trilogy. (star wars was a trilogy remember... makes you wonder)
2,Trying to get through it all,"I've picked up my Audio CDs several times for a long trip, and each time, I find myself putting something else in. With Eragon, I didn't seem to have this problem. However, with Eldest, I get bored at parts, and just drift off into other thoughts. It really doesn't keep you wrapped into it.I wish I could say more about it, but at this point, I'm hoping this is just one of those books in a series that has to be done to tie other books down the road together."
5,Better than the first.,"I loved Eragon, I really did, but Eldest is definitely the better of the two books. I see a few people complaining about the ""length"" and ""tedium"" of this book, but I think it showed a depth and pace that was pretty amazing. The details the author goes into about Eragon, Saphira, the elves, the dwarves, the Varden, the land... it's amazing, it truly is. And I love how Eragon isn't the only point-of-view character in this book... the breaks in his chapters for Nasuada and Roran were beautifully done, and their storylines were just as interesting as Eragon's own. I highly recommend this book to anyone, young or old... the whole trilogy, in fact, if the last book is anywhere near as good as the first two."
4,Great read!!,I have know idea why people keep saying so many bad things about this book! So far I think the trilogy is awsome. Especially this book. I love reading these books and what keeps me going is always knowing that more peices of Eragon's life will eventually pop up.. for example in this book we find out who Eragon's true father is and what Angela ment by saying that someone in his family will betray him.
4,Library,"I bought this book for my boyfriend and I and it was from a library and tape was all over it. Pages are not damaged, just the stamp of the library. One annoying thing happened when I went to my library and it set off alarms."
4,good read,"I have enjoyed all of the Inheritance series so far. Can't wait for the last book to come out. I read it to my 6 year old son and 8 year old daughter. We had to have a dictionary handy because there were a lot of words that even I hadn't heard before or didn't really know the meaning of. My son was bored with all the books, but my daughter didn't want me to put it down. We would read for at least an hour every time I would pick the book up. :)"
3,Good read,"I really did enjoy this book. I was a little bored however with Rorans story line but appreciated it a little more towards the end of the book.My favorite charactor is Saphira. I appreciate her sense of humor and comradity towards Eragon.I had a feeling from the first book who Eragons brother and father were.(yes, this did remind me of Star wars) but still I did find this story entertaining and now I am ready for the third installment.The second book does leave the reader wanting to know how the other rider is so much more powerful than Eragon and were he will go after this recent battle to become stronger before helping Roran rescue Katrina."
3,not like book one,My 11 yr old flew through book one but with eldest it's taking him forever to finish it...basically because things move slow in the book...like it's boring or not a lotta things happening...mind you i also bought him book 3 and i intended to buy book 4 that just came out.
1,I LOVE ERAGON!!!!,"Eragon was SUCH a good book. It is my favorite book in the WHOLE world - Eldest is my least favorite. It was too long, and unlike when reading Eragon, I welcomed diversions. One really annoying thing about this book is that the characters constantly say ""Aye"". Every character. Can't someone say ""yes""???They never said that before, so why are they saying it now? Even the royalty said ""aye"". Eldest really disappointed me. Eragon was much better."
1,a disappointment,"After reading Eragon, Eldest was very much anticipated. However, after getting thru half the book, I was sorely disappointed. Things seemed to move very slowly with little to no plot/character development. Only the last 1/4 of the book was interesting read, and of course it ended with a cliff-hanger in anticipation of the third and last book in the series. Very much doubt I will read that one."
1,LET'S FACE IT.......,......This book is horrible. Enough Said. God bless those who think it is a good book. May peace in the empty brain be with thee.
5,Where is the next one?,"I bought Eragon shortly after it was released but never got to read it. I finally started reading it about 2 months ago and could not put it donw. I finished Eragon and immediatly went to look when the next ""Inheritance"" book would be coming out and I was so thrilled when I found out it would be within the next month. I have now finished Eldest and am anxiously awaiting the next book of Inheritance. Eldest was just as good as the first book Eragon. I look forward to see what happens :)This is a GREAT book for anyone who loves dragons and any aspect of the fantasy realm."
1,"To Traci, ""dude""","I've been reading and enjoying fantasy for many years, and am neither young nor stupid. This book, put simply, was horrific. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I am entirely baffled at how anyone could think this is well written or inventive. Paolini is a thief. He should be ashamed of himself for such outright plagiarism. Even a young kid should know better."
2,"Derivative, unpolished","Paolini probably will be a fine writer someday. He's not there yet. The story needs to be tightened, the language brightened. It's one thing to be inspired by classic source material, and quite another to stick so close to it. The ""Star Wars"" and Tolkein comparisons have rightly been made by many, but there are also parallels to be drawn to LeGuin's ""Wizard of Earthsea"" novels and Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern, telepathic and bonded to individual humans. And when Paolini writes ""Barges? Barges? We don't want no stinking barges"" --- ugh."
3,Unoriginal but fun-ish,"When I first read Eragon, I really liked it. Of course, that's probably because I was 12. When I read Eldest, I enjoyed it too. Same with Brisingr. I'm rereading them now before the 4th one comes out. Yeah, they're all basically cheap knockoffs of Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragonriders of Pern, etc. but hey, at least they're mildly entertaining (except for the Roran/Katrina chapters, I just skipped over those completely). I am surprised he hasn't been sued for plagiarism already, though. :sI put these books on the same level as the Twilight series. Check it out at the library, don't waste your money on it."
1,"Count Frankula, I presume?","An amusing game to play with books is to try and figure out what a particular book would be like if it were a person.Well, I figured out what the Inheritance series is. Not a person, though, but a monster - a hybrid, that is, of Frankenstein and Count Dracula.Frankenstein because they are monstrous creations put together by a madman from the dead parts of entities created by people who knew what they were doing, and Dracula because both books are dead-bent on sucking the life out of literature. Basically, if Eragon and Eldest had a catchphrase, it would be 'I vant to suck your money!'The antidote to these malign creatures - I mean, books - is to purchase some garlic. In this case, good, original books. It's your only hope of survival."
1,The Truth...The Awful Truth,"Thanks to everyone who wrote honest reviews of Eldest - it saved me from spending money on it. My cousin's stuck with it though he can't even return it on account of the binding's crinkled. I didn't do that, but I will help him burn it. I never thought I would hate a book but Eldest is the rare book you litterally hate when you read it. The writing is so awful it's almost funny like its its own parody but I'm not laughing."
1,I think I have a self esteem problem...,"Why? I read this book. After hearing so many warnings about how terrible it was, I got a copy and read it.It's settled; I hate myself. That's why I inflicted on myself the punishment involved in reading Eldest. Reading it resulted in first 'my eyes! My eyes!', followed by 'my brain! My brain!'I warn you, visitor: do not read this book unless you've committed some awful crime against humanity and deserve to be soundly punished. It's so boring, so preachy and so poorly written that it could easily be used in prisons to subdue violent inmates. This isn't a book; it's agony on paper. Now if only someone could write another one for the author to read..."
4,"Gripping, but a tad predictable","The good: It was very entertaining, an easy read, and gripping.The bad: A tad predictable, and everything works out for the protagonists. (Except Eragon's love pursuit)"
5,amazing,this book is a great followup of Eragon. It is quite a bit longer but I could not put this book down. I read the whole 5-6 hundred page book in 2 days. it is very exciting and keeps you reading.
3,"not bad, could be better","Having purchased Eragon some time ago, I finally got around to reading it a few weeks ago, and it was good enough that I immediately purchased Eldest when I finished it. While not a bad story, I wasn't overwhelmed by it either, and the great secret revealed at the end in a ""Luke I am your father""-ish manner? I figured it out halfway through Eragon, without trying to guess. Overall I liked it, but what I really hope for Paolini is this: that someday he'll write something about which both he and critics will say, ""the Inheritance trilogy is the work of a child when compared to this new work."" I don't think he lacks talent. I do think he can do better."
3,Loooong Winded Prose,"It had been so long since I had read the first book, I rented the movie to refresh my memory. Whoever chopped that down to it's ninety minute running time should've been consulted as editor, for what results is an okay second ""chapter"" bogged down by a dull and endless midsection begging for some cuts.Everything in here could've had the same impact without the dragging details of Eragons Yoda/Skywalker like training to prepare him for Galbatorix.Beyond that quibble,I actually didn't mind the novel. Like many peope say it's hardly original. To me it smacks closer to Robert Jordan than Tolkein, but that's just opinion. I would suggest an abridged audio version to speed it all along until the upcoming conclusion."
1,Absolutely ghastly,"Since when do people get a million dollars and movie adaptations for stealing all their ideas and writing really poorly? Well, since Paolini got published. I hope it doesn't start happening often, because there should be standards in writing. This isn't literature or a good book; it's a silly manufactured pop culture phemomena. Pathetic really to consider that Alfred Knopf was friends with Tolkien himself. What would he say if he knew the company he founded was printing tripe like this?"
5,Trustworthy Source,"This product is as advertised. All the disks are scratch free and the case has very little wear. The product was delivered in a short amount of time as I was rather suprized to find it in my mailbox so soon, showing that Ms. Rachel Mann cares about her buyers"
3,So-So...caution for those with young readers.,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first. There were just too many strange things going on especially when Eragon visits the elves. Despite this, it was a pretty fun read.My one negative is that while many kids could enjoy the book I don't think many parents know that there is a ""bedroom scene"" between a dating couple. It's a little hard to skip over that part toobecause from there the story segways into another important story line...so my kids will be skipping the book.He's not a bad writer...hope he writes something else for a younger audience."
5,Eldest,"Eldest is the second book of the Inheritance series. After pledging himself to the Varden, Eragon seeks to further his training that Brom started. He travels to Ellesmera where he receives instruction from the last surviving dragon rider other than Galbatorix. Eragon's studies include swordsmanship and expanding his knowledge of the ancient language. He and Saphira do all that they can to prepare for the war against Galbatorix.Meanwhile, in Carvahall, Roran is left with the decision of what to do. There are Ra'zac and soldiers hunting for Eragon and Saphira, and they came to Carvahall and started making trouble. Roran must come up with a defense or they will all be killed.I really liked this book. It put a hold on me and didn't let go until I finished. I think Christopher Paolini did an excellent job making a complicated but interesting Fantasy novel."
1,Beyond Awful,"Simply put, this is the most embarrasingly bad book that I have read in years. Eragon was a fun story, if a mediocre book. Eldest is completely devoid of story, and seems as if it were written by a seventh grader. I literally hate myself for plowing through 668 pages of this."
1,Awful...[...],Read the [...] There are so many [] for a reason. This book is awful. [...] The dialogue sounds like it's from cartoonland and the characters are even more one dimensional than in Eragon.
3,No originality compared to Eragon (and that name is copied),Every trilogy has an episode that people want to skip. Eldest is the book for the Inheritance saga. Lets start with the good parts: building Roran and Nasuada characters. That's it! There are 200 extra pages for nothing. At the end of the book it feels as though Paolini had to rush in a conclusion. Totally dislike the new bad guy and the true identity of Eragon's father. This book really did not stand on its own. People may feel as though they once saw this in a movie or read it in a book long ago. All in all I'll give it three stars hoping that this will encourage Paolini to develop an original conclusion to the Inheritance trilogy.
1,No way is it 5 stars??,No way so many people think this is 5 stars. Is this for real? I mean if you read it like the whole complete book from start to end?? It took me 3 weeks to finish since it was so unbelevably boring. I'd fall asleep reading all the time. How in the world is all the stupid training with the elves 5 stars? What about all the incredbily dumb scenes with Roran? I cannot beleive real people are writing the praise. Did they hire robots?
1,What colors the grass in YOUR world?,"Eldest is a clunker not only does it go on and on and on and on but the story has no point most of the time. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I won't be reading the next book."
1,Very boring,"I've read all the reviews now that I've finished the first two books, and I am mystified by all the glowing reports. I may be twelve but I know a good book from a bad book. This book is incredibly boring. Paolini's writing is as unimaginative as it is wordy. He seems to take great lengths to describe stupid stuff with poorly chosen adjectives. Every paragraph seems to drag on, and nothing ever happens. A potential reader would be best suited to look elsewhere."
4,Eldest,"Lets be honest, not the best fantasy money can buy, but hey, it was cool to read. This was definately much better than Eragon. Experiance comes with age I suppose. And I would like to say that Paolini's general knowledge of ships and stuf like that is pretty impressive, I dunno about anybody else, but I'd be too lazy to look all that stuff up, so good on ya mate!Overall, good book. Very well written, in MOST areas."
5,the eldest,"the eldest was very interseting, just has eragon was. i could not put the book down. i look forward to reading the next book, in fact i wish it was coming out soon. but i do know that it is not writen yet. i high recommond this book to anyone who enjoys fansty books."
1,Eldest is a dud.,"My daughter is a voracious reader and tore through Eragon but said Eldest was a boring and couldn't finish it. Stop while you're ahead and don't buy this one. If curiosity will kill you, go to the library and borrow it. You're welcome in advance."
5,Amazing Book,I couldn't put it down. It was just a good as the first book and I can't wait for the third.
2,Not so good,While I was reading this book I was feeling that something is missing in this book. I was not feeling satisfied even when I finished this book. Later I realized that the author was trying to streach the story without any particular reason.I was afraid that probably he is going to streach the book in such a way that another edition will be needed. Thtas what happend. Compare to Eragon this book is very inferior. It's a huge book and take a lot of time to read. When I finished it I was just wondering; why the hell I read it.
1,Hated it!!,"I got this from my cousin who hates me so I should have known there was a reason. The reason is he hated the book so much he wanted to make me suffer it too. Is there any real plot in this book? After reading it I couldn't find one. To make it worse the characters talk, act, and think like Chucky and Tommy from Rugrats. Trust it from someone who got it free, it's not even worth free."
2,A reasonable FIRST fantasy experience,"My kids (ages 9 and 13) are enjoying these books, but I realized it is because it is their FIRST experience with reading in the fantasy genre. My 13-year-old son and I will be using Eldest for a parent/child book report and I'm looking forward to finding out what he likes most about the book and pointing him toward some of the other (and much better) books out there that include many of the same themes. Setting aside the much discussed derivative nature of the plots in the story, my biggest beef with this book is that the big surprise twist at the end involves a storyline that would have been both compelling and heartbreaking to read, yet is explained away in one paragraph of exposition. I agree that young Mr. Paolini is impressive in his accomplishment, but I believe there is something to be said for experience and maturity in the area of story development. This book is the fantasy flavor of the month, but will not be an enduring classic in the fantasy genre."
1,As Bad as Eragon,"I was hoping that somewhere along the line the characters would stop being copies of those in Star Wars... and they did eventually, just not very much. The major revelation at the end of the book wasn't even that as I'm sure anyone over the age of 2 could have seen it coming from half way through Eragon, the first book in this unoriginal trilogy."
2,I heard this story some where before...,"maybe in Tokiens great Lord of the Rings trilogy? Listen...this is a rip-off. I gave it 2 stars because it had some surprises and some likeable chracters. NOW FOR THE BAD POINTS.Some scenes were described SO well and yet they had nothing to do with the story while the important stuff was sumed up in one little paragraph.As he told this story, he drifted off into other peoples storys which got annyoing FAST.Eragon was WAY better. Just had to say this.I hate how he wanted to be mature. It was scary.SO...there you have this really bad book. Hopefully he""ll finish this off with a better book. If he dosent, then I hope he likes some REALLY ANGRY FANS! Anyway, I dont recommened this. Get Jurassic Park instead,"
1,Stupid,Everyone raving and hyping should be ashamed of themslves.20 dollars is a month's allowance. I had to do extra chores to get my allowance early too so i could get this dumb book. I will never ever again read another book by Paolini.
2,Ummm..........boring?,"Though this book had some interesting parts, it was overall very, very boring. After reading good books, I usually like to reread them over and over again. After reading ""Eldest,"" though, I didn't reread the entire book; I probably would have gone crazy 100 pages into it. I found myself rereading a few short paragraphs or a chapter. I didn't expect much after reading the first book, but this was even worse than I expected.I'm really disappointed at how popular this story is. There are so many better books out there for kids and young adults that I'm sad that this one is so popular. The writing style is immature and the plot is dull, at best.This story had the potential to make a great book, but it flopped miserably."
3,I met this guy!,"I met this guy at a booksigning in Chicago(my friend loves these book and I was doing for her birthday) He sat up there and talk about the book and did a Q&A. This guy remined me of those guys who go in there parents basements and play Dungons & Dragons in high school. anyways this guy was SO full of himself that I had to read his books to see why he thought they were so great. This guy get points for trying. He get a little creactor with the dwarf language, but at the end It comes down to being a Lord of the rings knock off. He is also WAY to proud of ""his world"" he creactor esp. in the 2nd book."
3,Decent,"Eh. It had its moments, but overall, it was mostly boring. I don't really see how it's different than star wars and lord of the rings and every fantasy novel that came before it. But that's just me.If you're a LOTR fan, you probably won't care for it, but if you've never read fantasy, this will be a gas."
4,GREAT READ!,This book has an exelent story line and is full of action fantasy.However only advanced readers should try to attempt to read this book as there is substancial gore that turns up in some of the war scenes aswell as the long and unpronouncable names that every character seems to have and of course you cant forget the actual size of the book itself. BIG!
5,Wonderful,I could not put the book down. Both this book as well as the first had me on the edge of my seat. The writing is extremely descriptive which puts you inside of the adventure. I highly recommed this book for reading if you are a fantasy fan! I cant wait for the last of the trilogy.
5,"Eldest, Book 2 of Inheritance series","Excellant book. These books have a really high level of fantasy writing coming from such a young author. Most fantasy is weak but this one actually has interestinch characters, a good plot, and a great writing style."
1,"Eldest, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings","Some people might think that Eldest copied Tolkien's elves, but I disagree. I think that Paolini made his elves different and interesting, and HE DID NOT COPY TOLKIEN in this area. BUT, I do think he copied many names (Melian, Beor, and others) from Tolkien. It is unfortunate that such a promising writer could not think of original names!Also the plot is exactly like Star Wars. *spoiler* This became most annoying when Murtagh told Eragon who his father was. Eragon didn't like that idea and Murtagh said ""Search your feelings, you know it to be true."" *cough* Vader said that!*cough*Eragon was excellent. Eldest was long, drawn out and lacked origianlity. It saddens me because I really thought the Inheritance Series would become the next Lord of the Rings. Unless Paolini does something amazing with the last book, it won't. =(- A Disheartened Eragon Fan."
1,i think this belongs to ff.net.,"""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf"" said PAolini.I say: ""Oh yeah! And that is why you write a ridiculous scene of a belching Dragon who gets drunk and falls over? Do Dwarven exist only to ""tugg at their beards"" and drink and belch? All that before the day the supposed great dead leader's funeral?Oh and can somebody explain the author the rules of the grammar?""humans"" ?????? ""dwarves"" ??????Please send him to school or better send him a home-school basic grammar book!!!!Good way to pay tribute to Tolkin by calling the lament of an Elf, ""a wailing sound""...tsk tsk tskPaolini reminds me of my first fanfiction creations, when i even went to sleep holding my thesaurus. Paolini's rippoff does not only bore it does also annoy with grammar mistakes and a continuous spurt or ill-placed fancy vocabulary. This book belongs to ff.net."""
2,sadly disappointed.......,"a decent story started in Eragon that comes to a somewhat screeching halt in this book. It was wordy, (not good words at that), slow moving, and I ended up skipping parts as I read, just to finish the book. While I will hold out hope that the last book will save the series...I still feel cheated. Chris...use plan language and keep things a little more simple, K?"
4,Really Nifty Hats,"This hat fit perfectly and was the toast of the occasion I wore it to.Warning to other buyers: this will warp in rain if made wet for too long. Take good care of it, and it'll be good to you!"
2,"So-so, but eventually breaks","This shade was great for the first few days we used it, but it stops sticking to the window in cool/cold weather (like 45 or below). Also, if you leave it down, it's great. But if you intend to be able to see out of that window and want to roll it up when not in use, don't count on it working for you. The button to roll it up eventually sticks and you have to manually push it up. It's okay, but not worth this price, and not worth using if you don't want to leave it down all the time."
5,Great Juicer-Great Price,"I don't think you can find a better, easier to use citrus juicer at any price. It's gone up a couple of bucks since I bought mine, but it is still the best deal available without question.It's fast, stable on the counter, converts to a serving pitcher when you're done juicing, and it's absolutely a cinch to clean up. I can't think of anything Proctor Silex could do to improve this product.If you're in the market for a citrus juicer (and fresh-squeezed is so far superior to anything you can buy in the grocery store) you can't do better than this one. Buy it."
4,i like it,"I used it for about an year already and it still works. I agree it is build cheap and have trouble dealing with pressure. But really what do you expect for 16 bucks? It works for me, I make juice a few times in month. And I don't feel like investing a lot money in juicer."
1,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but it's the same item","I purchased this citrus juicer a few days ago and used it for the first time today. Believe it or not, it also ""broke"" today. According to the product manual, you can juice oranges, grapefruit, lemons & limes. I had about 20 grapefruit to juice.The juicer juiced a lot faster than my old Toastmaster juicer, and the pitcher holds lots of juice, and I was just thinking that it was a great buy when I heard a strange sound - like a screw coming off the base. The juicer immediately turned off. I thought that a seed had fallen into the pitcher, or that there was some obstruction so I strained everything out, but there was nothing there. I then shook the base, and there was that strange sound again.I finally realized that the spring had broken. Can you believe that ?? First time I use it, and the spring breaks!! I had only juiced about 10 grapefruits!! This item is going back to Kmart tomorrow morning."
2,It would be great if it kept working!,"I bought the first one and loved it; everything, the design, easy cleaning, etc. After one week the motor gave out. Amazon replaced the juicer and this time it broke before I could finish squeezing the first half of my lemon (no pun intended). Back it goes but it's a shame."
4,Grrl Power!,"As a woman working in a male dominated profession, I am always on the prowl for soul sisters, women, who like myself, are not afraid to slog waist high through cypress domes or machete their way through the rainforests of central Honduras. We women of nature and exploration are a tribe of our own and I was grateful that Holly Morris put her experiences together in this book. It is refreshing and invigorating to read about women world wide who live unapologetically on their own terms."
5,Rockin' Good Time,"I was in the bookstore looking for something to take me to faraway lands while on my daily commute to work when I stumbled across Holly Morris' book. Having traveled quite a bit myself I often find travel writing pales alongside my own wild experiences. Not this time...not at all!Some of her tales of hilarious and some are inspirational, but each and every one made me consider a new perspective on a similar obstacle in my own life. That is what is so great about ""Adventure Divas""...It lets you ride shotgun every step of the way."
4,Great Movie,"I watched this movie multiple times before and I wanted to get a personal copy. The movie is not available on Netflix or aywhere online so it is worth buying, watching and keeping in your collection."
3,Buyer beware,"I ordered two sets of these as a gift - the packaging was terrible. These are sandstone coasters but there was no padding under them, so consequently one set was chipped, one coaster cracked. I was only able to salvage one set of coasters. And to add insult to injury, there was no replacement option - just the option to return AND the shipping charge was deducted. So I lost money through no fault of MINE. I would NOT order from this company again. Very disappointed."
5,Whoa~!~!~! Unbelievable~!~!,"Ok Ok - looks like the 40 people preceding me have said pretty much all there is to say about Rhonda, but, I just HAVE to put my 2 Cents in here.Not much of a Kuntry Muzik fan but I like Allison Krauss and Brad Paisley. Bluegrass always seemed a bit hokey.. . . until a Bud brought this dvd over and we watched it in its entirety. Rhonda knocked me out!!! I could not believe this kind of musicianship existed. Especially want to bring your attention to Josh Williams. He is an amazing guy. I would compare him to Les Paul, Chet Atkins, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani, but what he does with a guitar defys description.Whatever your taste is in music; classical, rock, tribal, you should do yourself a favor and get this dvd. It is a joy to experience. If Rhonda and The Rage do a show within 500 miles of your home, don't miss it.I can't say enough about this band, but,,,,, that's about it!"
3,Great performance... really!,"However, one catch... the banjo player is just too loud. Now that tells me (as a sound man) that they may have employed the old radio studio technique of using only one microphone with the players in a semi-circle around it. To make this work, balance is key and the players have to understand where they need to be in relation to the mic, how far back, who is to the side and who is in front, etc. Here, the banjo is just too loud.Otherwise, this is an amazing band and Rhonda Vincent is her father's daughter and a phenomenal talent in her own right."
1,Solitudes---NOT!!,"This album lacks the seamless blending of music and nature found on a Solitudes album. I have spent months in Yosemite, over the years, and feel that I have a connoisseur's appreciation of what it has to offer. I also have many of the Solitudes albums that mix nature with music. This album doesn't work. The music is jarring and all wrong for the environment it is trying to portray. I shut my eyes and it does NOT take me away to the Yosemite that I remember and love so much. To me, this album is like listening to a synthesizer trying to replicate a symphony orchestra."
3,"These worked for about 1 year, then broke.","If you are trying to save money by using skype and are thinking about buying these phone, well don't, it is just as cheap to buy an Android Wifi enabled phone that will work with Skype and use it instead, you will get more bang for you buck, plus i can't see myself carrying this around with me everywhere I go just in case I find free wifi somewhere to use it. After a year the battery burned out but I bought a new one for a camera that fit in there and used it, then the screen cracked, and eventually it stopped working altogether."
3,Belkin Skype phone,"Good product. It does however drop the signal and lose the network constantly. Its very poor voice quality on international skype out calls, and I have to revert back to my computer and headset to make important calls - that kind of defeats the object of having the phone."
2,Not worth the money,"I consider myself a gadget freak. I have the latest LCD 1080P TV, Tivo HD, PS3 and Wii. But, I just could not get this Belkin phone to connect to any network other than my own wifi network. I can call using my own wifi network in the same room to the same person and he would say that my call from my computer sounded better than the Belkin phone! The Belkin phone had an echo on the receiving end on every call! Save your money and look for something else."
2,Too many flows.,"After been a long-time Skype user I was looking for a phone that would give me more comfort that using a headset on my PC. I have 3 major issues with this phone:- I know it did not had a cradle, but the battery life is so bad that I keep it on charger all the time.- The quality of the sound is good, but the volume is too low for People to ear me properly- Most of all the wifi connection keeps breaking. Sometime during the call, sometimes without even using. and this with the phone resting 3 feet from my router..."
4,needs a better discription,"Over all these are really nice. However I've been looking for nude thigh highs with a black backseam, and if that is what you are looking for, these are not what you want. They are sheer black with a black seam or nude with a nude seam.... I might just color in the nude seam. Other than that they are soft, and are a perfect fit at the top, perfect for a garter belt, I wouldn't be able to wear them without one.I would give this product 5 stars IF they had a picture of both types, so you know EXACTLY what you are buying....I also bought [...]details and they are exactly what I wanted color wise.... BUT are quite tight up top, which gives me (I'm 5 foot 3, 100 lbs) muffin top thighs, which just does not work for what I want them for.... I may cut off the elastic and see if that helps."
3,"To the point, but somewhat heavy-handed","A set of 48 essays loosely concerned with the rights and wrongs of big business. It is sometimes hilarious, deliberately vulgar and occasionally tedious. There are overtones of Bill Bryson and even of Douglas Adams, but Gibbons can not sustain their standard. The valid points that the author makes are, for my taste, rather heavy-handed. It is a reasonable example of business humor with an edge, by a former CEO of a large corporation."
4,Awesome bluegrass but still a little country,"This album is really spectacular in terms of energy, quality, and performance...both vocally and instrumentally Rhonda Vincent and the Rage are extremely talented. The only small problem I had with this record were a few tracks that sound like typical country love songs. I am a bluegrass fan, NOT a country music fan...so I have to skip over a few songs but the bluegrass is really phenomenal. If I liked country and bluegrass then I would give this album 5 stars, but it still gets a solid 4 stars. Nonetheless I still say this is a must-have album for all bluegrass fans."
2,"Great songs, cheaply produced compilation.","I love J.J. Cale, which makes it all the more difficult to rate this compilation only two stars. Of course the songs are great - as one would expect from a collection of Cale tunes. The problem is with the production. This sounds like a bad home compilation tape I might have made on my cheap tape recorder twenty years ago. There was no effort made to remaster the material for CD, and worse, no effort to even out the levels between songs. The tracks are from different sources (of course), but they SOUND like it. I literally find it unlistenable, and I am no audiophile.What a shame - such a fine collection of songs deserves better than this slapdash and shoddy treatment."
4,It'll Have to Do,"For those who had the luck of obtaining a copy of NOW WE ARE 10 through the DM Fan Club, this is the same album with two extra songs and a great insert. I was unsure about buying it, but the two extra songs suckered me in. As I said, the insert is great with different stories from different people about the Dead Milkmen. The song quality varies as the recordings were either home recordings (raw and just beautiful) or recorded when performed live at WXPN in Philadelphia (censored but fun). It rounds out a collection perfectly, and hearing their energy pre-BIG LIZARD is a treat."
1,This CD SUCKS!!!!!,"This CD isn't labeled as a ""LIVE"" album but it is. It sounds like some douchebag is in the back row at their show with a 1970's tape recorder recording the damn thing. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
3,Not his best album,"No one could like Jimmie Dale Gilmore more than I do, but this is not his best album.I loved ""These Blues"", including touch of Jimmie Rodgers at the end. ""Blue Moon Waltz"" is nice. ""Story of You"" is O.K. Other than that this is probably Jimmie's weakest album, in my opinion."
2,disappointing and misleading,"I agree with the other reviewers about the extraordinary detail of the book. However, I could not get past the author's complete bypassing of nazi atrocities during the Russian campaign. He has no hesitation in chronicling the atrocities of the red army during their thrust towards Berlin. Along with this are numerous disparaging remarks about the quality, both moral and physical, of the Russian soldier, while the German troops are described in glowing terms. I got the distinct impression that the author had an admiration for the German war machine which draws him dangerously close to being a nazi apologist."
1,extremely biased,"This book is horribly biased against Russian side. If you believe what the author wanted to say, Russian won the war just because of the aids from United States! Russian soldiers were always stupid, druken, and German soldiers were brave, smart, skilled. Also it metioned little of the atrocity and mass murder by German army and SS in occupied Russia, while wrote a lot about the same thing Russian amy did on German soil. Not recommended."
3,Well written but boring,"Maybe I was biased because I dislike fake engagement stories. Maybe I read this too close to Layton's very fine The Duke's Wager.Whatever the reasons, I did not like this book. Yes, it was well written. Yes, the heroine was swell and likable. Still, it did not work for me. There was too much narration, too much telling instead of showing. Also, the hero's actions from the beginning(above mentioned fake engagement) did not mesh with his charaterization. He did not know her and was, in fact a bit of a cad. The writer did not adequately explain North's about face.I kept telling myself to keep reading and that such a well written book was bound to get better. Some parts actually did. Some did not. But I really had to force myself to stick with it. Romance novels should not be endurance tests."
3,a fine Bond movie ---- much better than Moore,"TND is a fine Bond movie. I think it is much better in the first half, before it slips into just ""Die Hard"" action stuff. The movie works early because of the whole ""former lover"" strand that is running through the plot. But that is dropped and he action begins and there isn't that feeling of revenge by either Bond or Carver...wasting the first half of the flick.TND is a good Bond movie and a good action movie. Balance between reality and total fiction is the line that good adventure movies have to tow - good Bond movies blend these well. This one is successful by doing this better in the first hour - not the second."
4,STYLISH & EXPLOSIVE,"Pierce Bronson demonstrates elan as ""Bond, Janes Bond"" in this quirkiest of the franchise. He seems to really have fun with the role. In a plot culled from todays headlines, he battles an ego-manical media magnate bent on rulng the world via his media empire (did someone say ORWELL?). Ruthless and chilling, Mr. Carver uses his press to advance his agenda which includes war with China, and the obligatory humiliation of his personal enemies (did some say WELLS?). The ""Bond Girl"" this time around is the beautiful Paris Carver - played by beautiful Teri Hatcher. It's too bad Paris doesn't have more time, because she is one of the best characters in the film. I say ""one of the best"", because even Paris can't hold a candle to that wonderful car! Fast paced and typically Bond-like. Great song from Cheryl Crowl!"
4,Pretty good.,"Pierce Brosnan returns in his second outing as Bond. Good action scenes, but isn't quite as good as GoldenEye. But this is still highly recommended for action/007 fans."
2,Ugh,"Although Pierce Brosnan rocks, the movie does nothing for him. What happened to plots? Acting? Good dialogue? I suppose it is all a thing of the past. But in all fairness, I didn't epect ""Tomorrow. . ."" to be the second ""Casblanca"", they could of tried a bit harder."
4,A favorite,I really liked this Bond because Pierce Brosnan is in it and i liked his girl in the one too.
5,Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh are fantastic together in this Bond movie!!!!,"This is one of the greatest bond movie I have watched. The chemistry between Michelle Yeoh and Pierce Brosnan added a nice touch of the great plot and great action. The other woman in love with Mr. Bond was very touching. She was truly in love with Bond, even though the wife of the bad guy. I liked that detail. It made this movie more appealing, more human.I love the martial skills of Michelle Yeoh. And Brosnan is the perfect bond--cool, elegant, sweet to women, tough to bad guys. Pierce Brosnan was at his best in this movie.Just a last remark, even though the run away scene was supposed to be in Vietnam, all the signs and writing seen was Chinese. Make it take place in China or Taiwan or another Chinese speaking country if you can't film in Vietnam or don't want to. A little tiny research effort would have been great."
4,In it for the cars,I just love all the awesome cars that are in the movie. Who doesn't love Bavarian Motor Works? Who doesn't?
4,An 80's surprise.,"Who would have believed this aging hippie band would reappear in the early 80's with one of their best albums ever? 'Long Distance Voyager' remains to this day one of the classic MB albums, and is an excellent update of their sound without sounding like a sell out. Side 1 is especially good, with the classics ""The Voice"" and ""Gemini Dream"" along with the standout cut ""In My World."" This was probably the last great Moody Blues album, as the 80's and 90's saw them churning out rather treadmill releases, capitalizing on their name recognition and 60's icon status."
5,A Voice begins and A Voice ends,"After too many years this classic has been remastered. The original CD was actually pretty good but this one is sharper, clearer, and warmer. Like the other Justin Hayward remasters its quality is first rate. These remasters boost the signal (the playback is noticeably louder), I am not quite sure why. The LP was a disappointment, ""In My World"" had a saturated signal and clipped frequency response. I usually use the LP as an benchmark of what audio should be, however this time the digital remaster wins."
2,Better than no mouse,"I will be replacing this new mouse asap. It is exceedingly jumpy, even when at rest. Even the wheel seems to jump as I'm scrolling through. Also, The cord is too long, and gets in the way."
4,Freeway Bounce Reduction,"I drive a 2008 Toyota Tundra Crewmax truck that is known for its bad bed bounce on rough roads. I live in Southern California where our freeways are often constructed with poorly leveled concrete slabs. Before I bought the ShurTrax my teeth would chatter and my passengers would get a headache after just a few miles. Toyota needs to improve their suspension and California needs to build better freeways. In the meantime the ShurTrax system has vastly improved the ride. There is still a slight bounce on the worst pavement sections, but it is now a much more comfortable experience."
2,Terrible recording of wonderful music,"I'm by no means an experienced sound technician, but I can tell when something is wrong. The low rating of this CD is not based off of the beautiful, catchy tunes. I have based the 2 stars off of the fact that this is a terrible recording. When the CD is played in my car I have to turn the volume all the way up because it it muffled, almost as if listening from another room.The bad recording quality makes it difficult to get a true appraisal of the vocalists or the instrumentals. I will say that I LOVE the music from this show, so when I saw this CD in a bargain bin, I snatched it up. It looks like I am going to have to spend the money to get a ""real"" copy of the musical so that I can sing along.I can vouch for the quality of the Bette Middler version, although she's not my favorite singer, she does a fantastic job as Mamma Rose, and the recording quality is much better. I have not listened to the Angela Lansbury version yet."
2,"A ""Rose"" Is Not Meant For Everybody","When I bought this CD and DVD, I thought I was watching ""Auntie Mame"". It is safe to say that Rosalind Russell is the worst Rose, no contest. The part was just to big for her. Thank God that Broadway revived the show with Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, and the wonderful Bernadette Peters (who takes the role to a new dramatic level). Trust me, save your money or buy Peter's cast album or Lansbury's."
5,"Here she is boys, Here she is world, Here's ROZ!!!","Kudos to Warner Bros. and Rhino for FINALLY making the bold & brassy soundtrack to the original 1962 GYPSY available on CD. Best of all, we now finally get to hear what Rosalind Russell's unused vocals sounded like.So, how do they sound?Well, the lady had some intonation problems to put it mildly, but her acting blows you away. She WAS the part. What a treat to finally hear these tracks after years of wondering what they were really like.The rest of the album is also a great listen, with that signature Warner Bros. sound (along with M-G-M's, the best orchestra in Hollywood).This is a must-have purchase for any true movie musical fan."
5,This book is a real wake-up call!,"I am a college student majoring in education and recently read ""Savage Inequalities"" for a class. Mr. Kozol obviously had the underprivileged children of our nation at heart when he wrote this book. I found the book to be an eye-opening, thought provoking, and heart wrenching account of the way some of America's children are treated in our education system. The author does an outstanding job of painting a very factual, although not so pretty, picture of the disparities these children suffer. Mr. Kozol's descriptions of the inequalities suffered by some of our children today should provoke us to push for change in our education systems. This book is a must read for every educator, future educator, parent, and/or concerned citizen."
5,A sobering view of the American educational system,"This book was a real eye-opener, exposing the wretched conditions of inner-city schools in America. I think it should be required reading for every person in this country, because it is an issue that receives little if any attention. I would never have known how bad the system is for some cities without reading this book.Kozol is an appropriate author, detailing specific trips he has taken to inner city schools to directly observe the state of their schools in comparison to the affluent suburbs.My only critique is that after awhile, the stories all seem to sound the same, but it just emphasizes how widespread this problem is and that something must be done about it."
1,Can you spot the logical fallacies?,"Kozol has done it again! While the book is very descriptive of the poor conditions in many inner-city schools, Mr. Kozol's thesis--that more government money should be put into education--is not borne by the facts. He presents arguments that are unthoughtful, unacademic, and unsupported. He has a very hysterical knee-jerk response to anyone who is supportive of a free-market approach to education.For those who are fans of Kozol and believe that my review may be too extreme, I refer you to the book ""Children of the Revolution"", also by Mr. Kozol. The book is little more than an apologia for Fidel Castro's dictatorship, a society with a conception of human rights that would not pass muster in a tribe of Barbary Apes (to borrow P.J. O'Rourke's wholly appropriate phrase.) Is this the sort of society that YOU want?"
1,It must be racism!!,"This book is a must read for anyone who prefers to blame their troubles on the all purpose scapegoat of racism rather than take responsibility for themselves, their children and their community"
4,great performances of magnificent music,"Yes, visually this DVD is a flop for the reason given, so I decided to not watch the screen. As a result I was quite pleased with this DVD which has all of Mozart's mature sonatas in performances as fine as I have ever heard and in excellent sound. It's a great buy for the music!"
4,A great item for Mike Peters/Alarm Fans,"The packaging leaves a little bit to be desired, but if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it. A different line up backing up Mike, but they sound great."
2,buyer beware !,"Of the many purchases I have made on Amazon.com over the years, this is the first one I have been dissatisfied with. The mat fits the dash correctly, but covers ( no cut-outs) the stereo speakers. The installation instructions say that this will not affect the sound of the stereo, but clearly does. My dash was thoroughly cleaned with alcohol before attaching adhesive strips but after a couple of days they quit sticking and mat refuses to lay flat to the contours of the dash. I am currently looking for another adhesive alternative at the current time."
2,I don't get it....,"I picked up this book because I have an interest in transgender issues and am always on the look out for personal accounts of what it's like to live in the body of one gender while identifying with the other. This isn't the book though. Still I thought it might be an interesting read. However, from the first few pages I wondered why I should care about Kim or her love Hadamar. I pushed myself to keep reading, but never found a reason to invest in what seemed to be an ""aren't we special"" pretentious story. Perhaps just not the book for me as I can see that many other reviewers have found it deeply touching. I, however, wouldn't recommend it."
5,I liked EDtv!,"This was, good Jenna elfman is pretty in this movie, it'd love to go television 24 hours, well the acting was, great I think you'll like this...."
3,Predictable,"Like many of Ron Howard's movies, there are others who have done it better. The movies mentioned in the Amazon.com review are all superior to EdTv, so if you must buy one, buy one of them. The main problem with this movie is its boring predictability. There were certainly funny bits and I liked the actors (though Ellen was, really, just Ellen), but it never made me laugh. The Dolby Digital DVD version should not have included the deleated scenes, watching them made the final cut seem even more empty. They show him relishing and encouraging much of the fame, which would have made him seem less of a victim. When the movie was over, I forgot about it."
2,Only worth watching if you have got two hours to waste...,"Like a lot of other people, I had a lot of great expectations (but I was not expecting the Truman show). It was BORING, the plot was STUPID. It was like ""The Truman Show Meets MTV's The Real World"" (and I HATE the ""Real World"", anyone who doesn't realize that the show is scripted is a fool). The only saving graces were the choices of some of the actors (especially Ed himself). There were a few good laughs, but it wasn't worth the torture."
2,seemed like a knock off,"This came quickly, but the product seems counterfeit. I don't have a real way to prove it, but it is definitely different from what I used to get at Costco."
2,Isn't what I thought,I had gotten this product several years ago and the ingredients were all natural. This newer product has a bunch of things in it that I DO NOT like to use. Very diappointed. Ingredients were not listed so I could I tell until I purchased it.
4,Nioxin,"Been using this stuff for over 10 years and my hair is still there. I believe it stopped falling out after I started using this product and it is no more expensive than most shampoos. So unless I hear for a reliable source it is no better than good shampoo, no reason to switch."
1,Dried out my hair something awful,"Didn't work for me, made my hair dry and brittle. I have no clue what people are talking about. Back to my $5 shampoo."
3,book partly succeeds,Book is helpful because there are not many books like this. But since written by an amateur and from a personal perspective it only partially succeeds.
2,The diver who can't swim...,"What a disappointment! This was one of (3) new bath toys that I purchased for my five year old for tub time. All three were basically junk. In this case, the diver can't swim through the water, and just flaps its feet like your child may do at swim class while holding onto the side of the pool."
4,Inspirational CD,"A good CD from Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, with testimonies mixed in. A very inspiring CD."
3,Rip off,"I'm really getting tired of artists coming out with 2-cd sets with barely one CD's worth of music on it. These 2 cds have barely 80 minutes combined on it. Take out the reprises, testimonies and pastoral remarks and you have enough material to comfortably fit on one CD. I wish they would stop trying to squeeze more money out of us by packaging it as a 2cd set.Israel Houghton's Live From Another Level and Hillsongs Hope CD are other examples of this. This Is Your House gets 3 stars because of it's consistent production but would have received 4 if it would have cut the crap and just made it one CD."
2,a little too basic,"Strossberg has selected a fascinating topic for her book, however, she fails to provide sufficient information to make her points cohesive and meaningful. I was hoping to use this book as a resource for teachers to integrate art into their science and mathematics lessons, however, I think they would just find it frustrating. Strossberg throws out a lot of quick connections between art and science, but never tells the reader enough to fully understand the concepts. Have fun with the pictures, but don't expect to learn very much."
5,True Grit,"Energetic, powerful, witty, off-key (at times) and utterly Brilliant. What's great about the two Libertines offerings is that they just do it. They don't try to impress you with their skills, they don't try to throw heavy word-play at you. They just pick up their instruments, channel their creativity and feelings/emotions and then play. The result is two of the best Rock albums of the 21st century. Melodic, powerful, incredibly energetic and at times downright beautiful in that imperfect sort of way. Anyone looking for a revival of Clash and Kinks stylings with a new rock edge will need not look any further. Stunning!"
3,ok brit rock,"I read about all the hype around this band, their first album is much better. drugs. feud. drink. smoke. break up band. repeat."
4,The Official Review,"Id give it a four and a half if i could.I'd like to start by saying that this album judged by todays standard of the crappy album deserves 5 stars, but because good music exists somewhere out there it gets a four and a half.If anything skip the album and buy Can't Stand Me Now of Itunes or another downloading sevice. That song is worth 3.5 of the 4.5 stars. It is a great slightly off, driving song that is edgy enough to be cool but has enough hints of emo to keep it catchy and fresh. NOT NEW FOUND GLORY CRAP EMO, im talking about the cure... hell yeah."
2,Somebody throw those waifs on the CD booklet a sandwich,"The words ""trendy bullsh*t"" come to mind when I think of bands like the Libertines and Razorlight. New bands nowadays have no substance or hooks to their songs; it's all just the same bland chords repeated ad nausem. Sometimes you'll get lucky and a band like The Libertines with rearrange those same three chords Razorlight has recycled from somewhere else. Undoubtedly, the most contemptible thing about these bands is that their frontmen wish to be Kurt Cobain. The singer of Razorlight has apparently has some issues with valium, and boasted to reporters he walked out of a drug treatment facility just like Cobain. Too bad he didn't make like Cobain and put a bullet through his noggin. I f*cking despise heroin chic vane male waifs. They're all about image and looks, and couldn't rock the mic to save their lives. If you ask me, the world needs some girl bands that harken back to era of the Go-Go's."
4,"Songs About Strife, Not Drugs","I loved Up the Bracket. A record that groveled in the urban drug culture to a hip and catchy tune. It reminded me lyrically of X's Los Angeles, another album with songs of desperation and tales of a gritty life.Now comes The Libertines, a record that grovels in tortured relationships, apparently that of the relationship between the leads Carl Barat and Pete Doherty. Theirs is a soap opera splashed all over the web and now all over this cd.There are a number of throwaway songs, but they are overwhelmed by stunning songs like Music When the Lights Go Out, The Sage and the Likely Lads. The opener, Can't Stand Me Now, tells you all you need to know about the tortured friendship that is on display here.Like Up the Bracket, the sound's not polished and Doherty songs like he's had a few too many when he sings. The bass lines are compelling and provide the drive for most of the songs. If you don't like it the first listen, try it again. Listen to the words and it will sink in."
5,Together we are heavy drug users,"This is one of the best albums of the year. It's surprising that The Libertines are still together and that Pete Doherty is still alive. Even though this record seems like a reflection over the past two years of the band, this record is more relaxed than its predecessor. The first single ""Can't Stand Me Now"" is almost as good as ""Don't Look Back At The Sun."" Other songs like ""Narcissist"" and ""Campaign of Hate"" are about the media fascination with The Libertines. There are not a lot of outright rockers like ""I Get Along"" but there is one hardcore punk song. There are zydeco and rockabilly influences. More of this an album is an exploration of The Libertines' sound. Once again Mick Jones (of The Clash) is back as a producer. I am not sure if this is their Give Em Enough Rope or London Calling. It is a thrilling album throughout."
2,South American pressing,Quality of the recording low. Muffled and muddling with no sharpness and inadequate clarity. Don't recommend it and sorry that I bought it.
5,Love the movie and love the price,"Picked this up for $5 and I couldn't be happier. I loved the movie, and all the related TV series. This is just a great addition to my collection of Stargate movies/shows."
4,Better than dvd,"This movie had excellent video and sound. I found some minor extra footage over my DVD version in this blu ray. However, I am overall very happy to have upgraded my DVD to this blu ray disk."
4,"Good ""classic"" Sci-Fi","I didn't realize how old this movie was until I purchased the blu-ray. I remembered watching it as a kid when it first came out and was greatly fascinated with the story line. As any conspiracy theories, the question of, are we alone, or how did we get here come to mind. 16 years later, this movie still fascinates me. Well-written and well-directed, this would capture the attention of any sci-fi lover, young and old. Even with movies like Avatar out now, ""old school"" sci-fis like this one will never get old. I hope they don't try to remake this one. Already visually fantastic for its time, movie fanatics should still enjoy this one, either it be the first, or 20th time."
3,The only Emmerich movie I can stand,"This is the only Roland Emmerich movie I can stand watching. I saw it in the cinemas when it first came out, and while the whole idea of ancient Egyptians and aliens was not new then, the movie treated it with much imagination. Seeing it again on Blu-ray, well, the colours are wonderful and the transfer is very good. the desert landscape never looked better, and because of the hi-def, you can even see the details of the floor of Ra's ""throne room""."
2,Third-rate science fiction.,"Well mounted but overly flawed sci-fi epic boasts excellent special effects, a good cast (Kurt Russell, James Spader, Jaye Davidson and Viveca Lindfords) and an interesting idea (archaelogoists of Ancient Egypt discover what appears to be a portal), but fails to live up to its premise. Unfortunately, Ms Linfords' performance and the top-notch visuals can only carry this so far. The relationships between team Russell/Spader and the new world natives are laughable, to say the least."
1,Crappy disc,"I love the movie Stargate. It's one of my favorite movies, but the quality of this disc was horrible. It took forever to load, you can't access the menu because they want you to watch the stupid previews. Then periodically the picture would jump around and when it would straighten out, the sound and picture was out of sync. I'm sending this back and just getting the $4.99 version on iTunes. What a waste of my time and money!!"
1,Too Wide for My Taste,"Yes this is a magnificent re-mastering of the film.Yes, the directors cut is superb.No, I am not happy with this DVD at all and here's why:But all that falls short when I pop the DVD in the machine and it shows T A R G A T across the screen. What is this? A cruel joke by TARGET? Is this subliminal advertising? Just kidding of course, but just how many people can play 16:9 movies in their homes yet? Is this the way all movies are going to go soon, and force us to spend thousands of dollars on an HDTV set? I hope not.The DVD is missing both sides folks, and if you don't have a 16:9 set, stick with the widescreen special edition, and save yourself the bucks and the anger.D"
2,Though it went on,"Though this film went on to spawn a series. I was never impressed by it. I thought it was dumb with so many glossing over historical inaccuracies and inherent racism that I was offended by the film. I like Kurt Russell as an actor and I worry abotu James Spader findign credible roles for his acting ability but this film is really bad and unfair to the historical truths of what races would look like. Like a Woody Allen film, it glaringly tries to removes people of color to make it more marketable and gentler."
2,i dont get it,has anyone noticed that there are two versions of the same film? there is the original and then this Special Edition.) did anyone also notice that the original costs more than this Special Edition yet both have the same extras--NO EXTRAS?!!Does it strike anyone else as this being odd?
4,Panned a little too much?,"I think Stargate gets panned a little unfairly. It's not a particularly great film, true; but I think it's good fun nonetheless. It doesn't bog the plot down with explanantions of pseudoscience or ancient history, and it sticks to simple characterisation. It's the kind of movie that grows on you, and has more akin to the ""Indiana Jones"" series or ""The Mummy"" than Star Wars."
2,mediocre sci-fi melodrama,"I just watched this for the first time since I saw it in 1994, and I must say that with the exception of a few scenes, this is a boring forwula-driven film. While Jaye Davidson is a very interesting RA - ""I created your culture, now I will destroy it"" - and Spader and Russell are exceptional actors, they cannot make up for the silly themes of oppressed people uprising, the establishment of a ""team spirit"" among the hapless military who took the trip, etc. It just doesn't hang together all that well and there is very little originiality. If you are a fan of hard scifi, don't bother with this one. It is just barely a cut above junk."
2,It's a movie all right.,"Have you seen the movie? Good, because as far as I can find, there is no way to watch this and know what the aliens are saying without subtitles, and when the subtitles are on, it's on for those speaking english as well. I have to say that I found this incredibly annoying and am fairly upset that this copy was like that, even my VHS copy didn't play it that way."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible Blu-ray reproduction","I've been a big fan of this movie since it came out. However, the Blu-ray version is a joke. A lot of portions of the Blu-ray are so grainy it looks like I'm watching a VHS tape. I can see why the Blu-ray disk is for $9.99"
1,Stay Away from this Blu,"This has to be the worst Blu-Ray transfer I have ever seen. It is so grainy in spots that it feels like I am watching it on TV in the 90s with a bad antenna signal. Some parts are even worse than others, how this got released is beyond me. Do yourself a fav and do not buy this version of Stargate."
3,Edited for TV,"The basic movie available for download becomes clearly NOT an original version based as you can tell it has been edited so that it can be shown on tv where movies cannot have cuss words the way sitcoms can. In the discovery scene where Daniel Jackson claims the ability to decipher the script on the alien world, Jack O'Niel originally stated to the General, ""He's full of Sh**"" but in this varient you hear, ""It's your call.""I always hate when things are not allowed to be as originally released unless a director's cut puts in more matter, but to NOT indicate this on the ad page is nearly deceptive and that is why I am making this post."
5,Excellent movie with nice DVD features,"This movie is an excellent transfer of the original. The picture and sound quality was great, and the extra footage was very interesting. I especially liked the special DVD feature of being able to play the special edition with the extra footage, or the theatrical version without the extra footage. I would recommend this version to anyone who liked the original."
3,Amazon ripped me off!,"Amazon promises that this DVD has a ""making of"" documentary included(look where it says ""DVD features""). In fact, the version they sent me does NOT! I later learned that the ultimate edition is supposed to be a 2 DVD set, with the ""making of"" doc being on the second disc. Amazon sent me one disc only. I think what happened pherhaps is that originally, the first ones they produced were a 2 disc set(these were the ones with the gold foil) and later editions without the gold foil did not include the second disc. That is all fine and good, but Amazon should not make false claims about what you're getting. Also, they say that it includes both the theatrical cut and the longer version. Mine has only the longer version, probably becuase the theatrical cut is on the missing second disc! I've been cheated by amazon.com"
3,"movie is still great, but...","I was a little bummed by the transfer to hi def... Was hoping for the same awe as when I first watched the newest blu ray version of Blade Runner. Fans of that movie should NOT miss it! Really anxious to see how they treat ""The Hunt For Red October"" in blu ray. Anyway, Stargate is still a very good movie, but I'd stick with whataver version you have on dvd already and be happy with the up-convert on your HD tv."
2,quality not better than DVD...waste of money,"I have to first say I am a huge Stargate fan, so I jumped at the chance to own it on blu-ray. However, I was not at all impressed with the quality of the picture. Some of the effects they did seem to improve for the blu-ray disc, but many of the scenes were still very grainy like they are in the DVD version. Some might say this is because the film is old, but I also own the Rambo movies on blu-ray and the quality is superb...you can see all the beads of sweat on his head. Obviously, Rambo is also an old movie that they managed to restore to blu-ray quality, so why not Stargate? If I had known what the quality was like before I bought it, I would have passed and kept my DVD version."
5,Who Is This???,"Who the heck wrote the editorial review for Amazon?? Whoever it is, they sure don't know much about movies! ""Hokey""? ""Senseless""? Obviously, not only is the reviewer no lover of science fiction, but he, she, or it has no knowledge of current science whatsoever! Listen, this is one of the best movies I've ever bought. You could do worse by latching onto ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane.""Laugh that one off, Amazon Reviewer!"
3,OK Movie,"It looks and sounds great. Overall, though, in terms of story, etc., I 'd call it just above average."
4,Well above average sci-fi !,"I found this to be a rare experience where you wish the editing team had left it a bit longer and you got to see some of the footage that was clipped. While Russell's performance may be a bit one-dimensional, but then the character he plays is just that -- someone transforming BACK from the 'dark' to a, pardon the cliche, well rounded person. Spader on the otherhand comes off better than 'well' from the start as the geek archiologist -- looking a bit like Bill Gates at that, whose more human side likewise transforms. The good special effects augment a strong story rather than being the centerpeice itself. Veteran actress Vivica Linfors is perfect as the kindly if somewhat matriachical civilian project leader whose domain is overtaken by the military. Overall it is an evenly enjoyable experience with good production values that draws in the audiance and holds them all the way through; certainly a credit to good direction but equally so to a fine script."
5,Stargate 15th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray],"Stargate 15th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray] After playing about a 150 BR's this is the first one that does not play but the previews.. It won't let me enter in Theatrical Version,Extented or even Scene Selection...AFTER THE FIRMWARE UPDATE THE THE BLU WORKS AND THE PICTURE IS STUNNING..."
5,Very well done Blu-ray,"I watched this on a 90"" front projection screen with a full 7.1 HD setup and must say I was impressed with the transfer. The movie was nearly flawless and considering the age of the film that says a lot for the job done. The audio is what one would expect from an early 90s movie and the subtitles are all 100 percent correct. The scenes without subtitles are intentional to immerse you in the movie experience. And they add to the realism of the film. I don't honestly know what was cut from the extended version. It seemed to be very close to the original. Overall a great film that started my favorite TV series. Nicely done. If you like Stargate SG1 then you will like this movie."
2,For Julio Iglesias fans; tangueros will be disappointed,"The music is pretty and nice. A fan who enyoys smooth vocal music will enjoy this.In order for Iglesias' voice to be showcased, the instrumentals are generally quiet or absent. There is not much rhythm. You can't really dance tango to this.That is okay, I guess, but I got the CD because I thought it would be an interesting new addition to the revival of Argentine Tango. If not for the arrangement of this music, Iglesias could have done that."
4,Collector's Encyclopedia Of Barbie Doll Exclusives: Identification & Values 1972-2004,"The Collector's Encyclopedia Of Barbie Doll Exclusives is a great reference to the value of different types of Barbies. I was a little dissapointed that the Holiday Barbies and Bob Mackie Barbies are not listed in the book but I was pleased, otherwise. I would recommend this book."
2,MA Bar,"Again, like the other products I ordered, I expected the scent to be warm and sweet, and found it to be more herbally than I like. This bar did make alot of bubbles, but also turned the water a very dirty brown color - husband entered the bathroom and asked if the water was actually supposed to be that color."
5,A Christmas favorite...,Wonderful medieval music for Christmas. (Even my kids like some of the tracks!).Highly recommended.
3,Not quite the quality I expected,"I received my steering wheel cover very quickly, which was nice. However, I'm not overly impressed with it. I struggled to get it to fit on my steering wheel (2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport) and there are spots on the cover with sharp/pokey plastic pieces. It's cute, I just don't think the quality is the greatest."
1,white color changes to brown,I bought the Tinker Bell wheel cover and the floor mats to match. Within less than six months all the white color parts of the Tinkerbell wheel cover changed to brown. The mats are still ok. I am just guessing but I thought it may be due to the sun or summer heat.
4,Listen up,"This was a great single, but now you can get the bonus song ""Seven Days"" along with other bonus tracks on ""The Poison"" deluxe edition full length cd. The first track is NOT live."
1,Used stroller travel bag,"I bought this travel bag for vacation. When I got home I noticed that the tape that closed the box was cut. When I took the bag out and looked at the wheels they were nice and used. A total inconvenience to me. Its just like Babies-r-us to take things back and not check to see if they were used. This has happened to me on more than one occasion from them. Just like the Exersaucer I bought, as well as the infant car seat, all opened and used. So just a note to everyone- check it in the store- BEWARE they take everything back and put it right back on the shelves. They probably would take back used diapers too!!"
4,"For $30, it does the job.","We bought this bag to protect our Graco Quattro stroller. It fit in easily with room to spare for other baby equipment. The bag did get pretty beat up on our flights, but the stroller was protected. This was our first flight with all the baby equipment and wanted to make sure we had a working stroller when we reached our destination. My sister had checked her stroller right before getting on the plane and the airline said they weren't liable for damages. She was then stuck with no stroller at Disney World. I'm glad we bought this bag and I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling with a stroller!"
1,Useless after one flight,"We used the bag for a direct flight and packed only our stroller into the bag (it fit perfectly). Going from the parking lot to the terminal was slow going because the bottom of the bag does not have any support so the stroller was pushing the bottom down to the ground, causing it to drag. We commented at the time that the bag wouldn't make it through too many trips with the dragging problem. We'll never know how long the bottom would have survived. When we retrieved the bag after the flight, there was a huge tear at the TOP of the bag from the bag being hoisted by it's handle. Our recommendation to Eddie Bauer: Reinforce both the top and the bottom. Our recommendation to prospective buyers: Don't buy until the product is improved."
2,good but not durable,"I have used this cover on one trip. It was very helpful, and easy to use. The whole side opens up so that the stroller can fit in quickly, and the bag has wheels for easy moving. The only bad thing about this cover is that when using the wheels to move the stroller the cover drags on the ground and it wore a hole in it. I was very disappointed that it was so fragile. I only used it on it's wheels for maybe 100 feet and it already has a fairly large hole in it."
3,Horror Classics Vol. 5 - ID#12279,"Four movies on one discHorror Classics Vol. 5 - Platinum Disc ID#12279#1: Silent Night, Bloody Night - 1973 - Director: Theodore Gershuny#2: Scared to Death - 1947 - Director: William Christy Cabanne#3: Good Against Evil - 1977 - Director: Paul Wendkos#4: Kill, Baby Kill - 1966 - Director: Mario BavaAll in all; decent picture, decent sound. Nothing special, but menus all seem to work and thats rare for cheap compilation DVD's.These movies are available individually from amazon, so you can see actual reviews and movie details if you search for the title under DVD's."
2,Nothing new here..,"What is ""cutting edge"" about animated shorts over 10 years old and internet cartoons we've all seen before? I keep hoping for Spike and Mike to release just one good DVD, but from the looks of it, it probably won't ever happen.While the quality of the cartoons here are a step up from their usual bathroom humor, all of them are pulled from previous video tape and DVD volumes. There's not a single piece that even a casual fan has not seen a million times before.. have they given up on finding new material? Out of money? Too out of touch? I used to be a big fan of this stuff, but these guys have been out of steam for years."
5,The secret weapon in the World's Best Barbecue Shrimp.,"Mine!OK, so now you know my secret so I might as well tell you that anchovy paste is alsocritical. Send me some royalties awright!I have to laugh at the negative reviews for this wondermous stuff, you're not supposedto eat it with a spoon, its a concentrate you nimrods! Sheesh.I also use this in gumbos, and recently tried it in some homemade vegetable soup and guesswhat.... it was GREAT!!! Very versatile, I can imagine any number of uses.Better Than Bouillon has a great product line, and this is the Flagship. No kitchen shouldbe without a jar of this, and it lasts a long long time in the fridge. Seriously, whats tocomplain about?"
2,Better than bullion but worse than the Custom Culinary's,"We hadn't been able to find our favorite lobster base at Surfas, LA. They've been out of stock since the first of the year. So, following the reviews here, I bought a jar of Better than Boullion lobster bast, $6.19 at Bristol Farms. Tasted it: It's not good, no way can it be compared with Custom Culinary's. With only a hint of lobster, dark red color, and tasting strongly of tomato paste, it won't do here. Surprisingly, Better than Boullion has an excellent chicken base and their ham base if good too. Had I looked farther down the page, I would have noticed that Amazon also carries the Custom Culinary ""Gold Label"" lobster base, which is the brand we had been using. Yes, it's more than 3 times as expensive, but a bigger jar, much less need be used at one time, and the flavor is a world of improvement...really tastes like lobster and enhances everything from fish chowder to thermador."
1,Not the best Hilfiger scent,"I usually love Hilfiger fragrances, but I didn't like the way this one smelled at all. It was so strong at first that it gave me a headache, and then after about ten minutes, it smelled kind of stale. I gave it to my sister and made her promise not to wear it around me. Maybe it smells different on other people, but I definitely would not wear it again myself, and based on that, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, either."
5,Excelent,"Tommy Hilifiger launched Tommy Girl in 1996, its known for its flowery, fresh scent blending with heather, sandalwood and flowers. Its best for daywear."
5,One of the all time Greats,I loved this inventive comedy. When I first saw The Pest I fell over laughing the music is perfect and so is the action.
5,It was the funniest movie I'v ever seen!!!!!,"If your ever in need for a good laugh just rent this movie it's soooooooo funny!!! Love,peace, chicken grease!!!!"
2,not worth John Leguizamo,"As much as I love John Leguizamo, this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Leguizamo fans, rent it, but don't spend your money on the DVD."
5,What can I say,"Samsara is the most pleasant fragrance I've ever had the pleasure to wear. It smells even better, the longer you have it on. Highly recommend it. A bit pricy but worth every penny. Not your run of the mill scent. It's wonderful."
3,"An interesting, if prejudiced, biography.","This life of General Albert Sidney Johnston was written by his son about twenty years after the War Between The States. It covers his entire career, while concentrating upon the events surrounding the fall of Fort Donelson and the battle of Shiloh. It is obviously designed to prove that Gen. Johnston was not to blame for the fall of Fort Donelson, and that he deserves credit for a great strategic success at Shiloh, which was spoiled by his untimely death. Despite the propaganda, I quite enjoyed the book. Gen. Johnston was highly regarded by President Davis. Many thought him to be the equal (or superior) to Lee and that his death was a great tragedy to the Confederacy. The book is somewhat dense reading, containing numerous letters to support the author's case. Many were solicited from the surviving participants after the war."
1,What a mess!,"Stick w/ Epson ink. The Rinotek does not fit very reassuringly, and the first one did not even work, plus leaked all over the inside of the printer. Stuck a second one in...this one seems to work OK, but just does not fit into the slot with the same, I don't know how else to put it, reassuring way. How 'bout just a sloppy fit, feels like it might pop out."
3,Overatedeye,Recently watched this after not seeing it since its premiere in 1995 and it is just plain ridiculous. I cant understand why so many people rated it so highly.
